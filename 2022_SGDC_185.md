Criminal Law – Offences – Prevention of Corruption Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9027/2022/01.\]

22 August 2022

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

1       The Accused, Mr Chuah Khai Huat, claimed trial to two charges under section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (“PCA”) for obtaining and accepting gratification of $3,000 and $1,500 respectively, as inducement for forbearing to do certain acts in relation to his principal’s affairs.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on both charges. I sentenced the Accused to a global term of 22 weeks’ imprisonment and ordered him to pay a penalty of $4500, in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment-. The Accused being dissatisfied with his _conviction_ has filed an appeal. He is currently _on bail_ pending the hearing of his appeal.

3       I had provided oral grounds at the conclusion of the trial to briefly explain some of my findings and my decision to convict the Accused.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) I had also provided brief reasons for the sentences imposed.[^2] As the Accused has appealed only against his conviction, I shall focus on elaborating on my reasons for finding the Accused guilty.

## The Charges

4       The charges against the Accused were as follows:

> DAC-913587-2018 (1st charge)

> You \[…\] are charged that you, sometime in or around March or April 2017, in Singapore, being an agent, to wit, a Resident Engineer in the employ of CPG Consultants Pte Ltd, did corruptly obtain a gratification of SGD3,000 from one Dai Jun, a Site Manager of Glory Construction Pte Ltd, as an inducement for forbearing to do an act in relation to your principal's affairs, to wit, by not causing delay in piling works carried out at Taman Jurong Nursing Home construction site, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

> DAC-913588-2018 (2nd charge)

> You \[…\] are charged that you, sometime in July 2017, in Singapore, being an agent, to wit, a Resident Engineer in the employ of CPG Consultants Pte Ltd, did corruptly accept a gratification of SGD1,500 from one Dai Jun, a Site Manager of Glory Construction Pte Ltd, as an inducement for forbearing to do an act in relation to your principal's affairs, to wit, by not creating problems for Glory Construction Pte Ltd in its works carried out at Taman Jurong Nursing Home construction site, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

## Undisputed facts and the issues at trial

5       Much of the background facts and circumstances of the case were undisputed at trial.

6       The offences took place in the context of the development of a six-storey nursing home at Yuen Ching Road. This was referred to as the “Taman Jurong Nursing Home” project during the trial (“the Project”). The owner of the Project was the Ministry of Health (“MOH”), while CPG Consultants Pte Ltd (“CPG”) was appointed as the project consultant.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) The main contractor for the Project was Chiu Teng Construction Co. Pte Ltd (“Chiu Teng”).[^5] A related company, Glory Construction Pte Ltd (“Glory”), was appointed as the subcontractor for structural works.[^6] Ryobi-Kiso Pte Ltd (“Ryobi-Kiso”) was the sub-contractor for bored piling works for the Project[^7] and they had in turn engaged Star Piling Pte Ltd (“Star Piling”) to perform the works. During the trial, it was not disputed that the progress of the piling works for the Project were captured in the “Bored Pile Records” (Exhibit P1) by Star Piling and that piling works commenced on 10 March 2017 and were completed on 29 April 2017.[^8]

7       As a number of individuals associated with the Project were called as witnesses or mentioned in course of the trial, it would be useful to set out their respective roles or involvement in the Project for ease of reference:

8       At the material time, the Accused was employed by CPG, on behalf of the Ministry of Health, as the Resident Engineer (“RE”) for the Project.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) He reported to Jean Ho, who was the Professional Engineer for the Project.[^10]

9       It was not disputed that work for the Project commenced in February 2017 with the ultimate load test pile being conducted at the worksite. The parties involved in the test pile included Chiu Teng, CPG and Ryobi-Kiso. It was not disputed that the Accused was in attendance at the test pile pursuant to Jean Ho’s request for his assistance. However, he had yet to formally commence employment as RE for the Project at the material time as he was still engaged in another project. The Accused only began his formal employment with CPG from 6 February 2017.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

10     It was not disputed that the Accused was paid a monthly salary of $7000 by CPG and this was inclusive of, _inter alia_, overtime payment and mobile expenses.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) The Accused’s working hours were from 8.30am to 5.30pm on weekdays and 8.30am to 12.30pm on Saturdays. The Accused’s employment contract also stipulated that that he might be called upon to work after working hours or on Sundays as and when required based on demands at the worksite.[^13] Further, no overtime would be paid for work done beyond normal hours as it was deemed to be included in his salary package.[^14] As part of the terms of his employment, the Accused was not to engage in any other business or occupation during his employment with CPG, without the latter’s written consent.[^15] In addition, the Accused was not permitted to accept any “gift, favour or concessionary offer from any individual or organisation doing or seeking business” with CPG.[^16]

11     Part of the Accused’s duties included the supervision of the contractors of the Project and conducting checks on the quality of their work. He was assisted by two Resident Technical Officers (“RTOs”) in his work on-site. When the sub-contractors completed a part of the works for the Project, they would inform the site engineer of Chiu Teng who would check the works. If the site engineer were of the view that the works were ready for formal inspection, he would complete CPG’s inspection form and submit the same to the Accused to request for inspection. The Accused would either proceed to inspect the works personally or assign one of the RTOs to do so. Thereafter, the Accused would endorse the inspection form if he was satisfied with the work done. The contractors would then be able to proceed with the next steps in the work schedule. However, if the works were not completed to his satisfaction, the Accused would state his reasons for not passing the works. Rectification would need to be done and the works must pass inspection before the contractors could proceed to the next stage.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

12     Dai Jun, the alleged giver of the gratifications, was Glory’s Site Manager. He was in charge of project operations and management, manpower assignment, and project expenses. At the material time, Dai Jun was managing Glory’s work at the Project as well as five other worksites.

13     Glory started work on-site sometime in February 2017 with the construction of the surrounding walls followed by a site office. The Accused shared a room with the RTOs (with an area partitioned for the Accused) on the second level of the site office, while the contractors were located on the first level.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

14     Weekly site meetings were held on-site during the construction of the Project. At these meetings, Chiu Teng’s representatives would provide an update to CPG’s representatives on site progress and raise any technical issues for resolution.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

15     It was not disputed that sometime in August 2017, CPG received information from Brian Lim, a senior project manager from the Ministry of Health Holdings, that there was possible corruption involving the Accused. CPG commenced internal investigations into the matter. A Commission of Inquiry (“COI”) was subsequently convened, and the findings and recommendations of the COI were set out in a report dated 6 September 2017 (Exhibit P11). The Accused was excused from site duties of the Project on the same day.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

16     The central issues of fact at trial were:

> (a)     whether the Accused did obtain or accept gratifications of $3,000 and $1,500 respectively from Dai Jun; and

> (b)     whether the gratifications were obtained or accepted as inducements for forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, as stated in the charges.

17     The prosecution’s case, in a nutshell, was that these payments were made by Dai Jun to the Accused as a result of sustained and insidious pressure exerted by the Accused on the staff of Chiu Teng and Glory, whose work he was tasked to supervise. According to the prosecution, the Accused had created problems for the contractors in relation to work inspection, thereby causing delay to their work. At the same time he had been asking them for various favours and payments which were not rightfully due to him from them.

18     The Accused’s defence, in essence, was that he had never obtained ‘or accepted any corrupt payment from Dai Jun. According to the Accused, although he had asked the staff of Chiu Teng for remuneration for services he rendered during the test piling stage, he did not receive any payment. Instead, the only money he received from Dai Jun was a sum of $1000 as remuneration for his work as part-time RTO in a separate project at Moulmein Road.

## The case for the prosecution

19     The prosecution called a total of 16 witnesses to prove their case against the Accused. The evidence of the material witnesses is summarised below.

### Initial delay in the piling works

20     Ravi was the operation cum project manager of Star Piling and the Project was one of the worksites under his supervision. Ravi explained that piling works were divided into two parts. The first stage involved “boring” or using machinery to drill a hole in the ground to the required depth. The second stage would be to “cast” the pile. This referred to the insertion of a rebar cage into the bored hole followed by the pouring of concrete to form the pile. The entire process would typically take between one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half hours to complete, with both parts of the works being done on the same day. Before commencing piling works in a construction project, an “ultimate test pile” was required so as to determine the correct depth to be bored for the actual piles.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

21     Ravi recalled that there was initial delay to the piling works for the Project. This was due, in part, to the early cut-off time of 3.30pm set by the Accused for inspection of the pile by him or the RTO, before casting could be done. As the cut-off time was set at 3.30pm, Star Piling could only complete one pile per day at the start of the piling works. This was because the workers were unfamiliar with the site at that time and there were concerns that if they started work on the second pile, they might not be ready for inspection by the cut-off time and this, in turn, would result in them not being able to proceed to cast the pile on the same day. Ravi was of the view that the cut-off time of 3.30pm was too early since the usual practice was to set it at 5.30pm. The situation was further compounded by the fact that one of the two boring machines were experiencing issues. However, things started to improve after Ravi spoke to Chiu Teng’s representatives on site and asked that they make a request to CPG to extend the pile inspection cut-off time. The cut-off time was extended by an hour to 4.30pm and Star Piling was able to complete two to three piles per day from 15 March 2017. Concerned that they would still be behind-schedule, Star Piling made a second request to extend the cut-off time. This was acceded to, resulting in the cut-off time being set at 5.30pm. A third boring machine was added. Thus, Star Piling was able to complete at least four piles a day from 20 March 2017. Overall, the completion of the piling works for the Project was delayed by three days. [\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

22     Ravi’s testimony that the early cut-off time for inspection contributed to delay in the piling works was corroborated by Goh, Li Bin, GM Lim and Yeo. Goh (Chiu Teng’s structural engineer at the Project until mid-April 2017) and Yeo (Chiu Teng’s project manager) both recalled that the Accused had set an earlier cut off time for inspection while piling works were going on and this resulted in delay to the pace of the work.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) Li Bin (Chiu Teng’s site engineer), echoed Ravi’s evidence that the initial piling rates were about one to two piles per day when the expected rate should be three to four. He confirmed that the progress of piling works improved when the cut-off time for inspection was extended to 5.30pm or 6pm and more machines were added.[^24]

23     GM Lim also testified that sometime during the piling stage of the Project, Yeo and Dai Jun informed him that the Accused imposed a cut-off time for inspection between 3 to 4pm. This led to delays as they could not proceed with the next pile. As a result of the delays, CPG requested that GM Lim attend the site meeting. To resolve the issue, GM Lim asked Ryobi-Kiso to deploy an additional piling machine to speed up the works and Chiu Teng incurred added costs of about $25,000 as a result. Although GM Lim did not think it was appropriate for the Accused to set the cut off for inspection so early in view of the Accused’s working hours, he did not report this to CPG as he was concerned that the Accused would create more problems with inspection of works on site. GM Lim added that he had asked Dai Jun to assist to help supervise the progress of the piling works as he had more experience than the site engineers. Further, any delay in piling would lead to a delay in structural works, which might, in turn, result in Chiu Teng being penalised.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

24     During the piling stage, Kew (CPG’s Principal Engineer) also received feedback from Yeo that the Accused was quite stringent during inspection and work on-site was delayed as a result. Kew agreed that the Accused was working within the parameters of his job responsibilities in being strict. However, Kew was not aware that the Accused’s inspection timing did not extend to his full working hours on-site. Kew gave evidence that pile boring activities could carry on up to 7pm, in accordance with the contractor’s working hours. He was unaware that the cut-off time for boring works was 3.30pm at the Project site and testified that the Accused did not have the right to stop the contractor from doing their pile boring works.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) Jean Ho took the view that it was not proper for the Accused to set a cut-off time for inspection at 3.30pm especially if the inspection could be done within an hour.[^27]

### The Accused’s request for overtime pay from the contractors and issues with inspection of the works

25     Sometime in March or April 2017, the Accused began asking staff from Chiu Teng and Glory for overtime pay.

26     Goh recalled that the Accused was present at the Project site on several occasions during the test piling stage, which spanned about two weeks. According to Goh, when piling works were going on, the Accused told Goh that he had started work even before he signed the contract with CPG and wanted to claim for overtime pay. Goh passed the message to the project manager Jerry Tan, who responded that a timesheet was required. Upon Goh’s request for a timesheet, the Accused presented Goh with the slip of paper in Exhibit P5.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

27     When Goh left the Project, he handed P5 to Yeo, informing Yeo that the Accused was claiming overtime pay for test piling work at the rate of $250 per day. Based on his understanding of the dates written in P5, Yeo proceeded to write the words “12 day -- $250 per day” and “RE OT” in P5. Goh also handed Yeo a petrol receipt (Exhibit P22) and telephone bills belonging to the Accused and told Yeo that the Accused wanted to claim for those expenditures. Yeo briefly discussed the Accused’s claims with GM Lim and the decision was not to pay the Accused. However, Yeo decided not to inform the Accused of this as he was afraid of worsening the tension between the Accused and the contractors on-site.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

28     Sometime in April or May 2017, the Accused also mentioned his claim for overtime pay relating to the ultimate load pile test to Chiu Teng’s project director, Seaco Tan. The Accused told Seaco Tan that there was an agreement between Chiu Teng and him to arrange for him to attend the test piling. The Accused subsequently sent Seaco Tan a WhatsApp message on 3 May 2017 (Exhibit P13) asking Seaco Tan to help settle his claim. When Seaco Tan enquired about this with Chiu Teng’s quantity surveyor, he was told that there was no agreement for such a payment. Seaco Tan received the same response when he asked GM Lim about this.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

29     Li Bin recalled the first time he witnessed the Accused asking for overtime pay was in April 2017 after piling was completed and excavation works started on site. The Accused was performing pile cap inspection in the presence of Huang (Glory’s site supervisor), and Li Bin when he told Huang to inform Dai Jun about the overtime matter. Li Bin subsequently informed Yeo and Dai Jun about this. Specifically, Li Bin told Dai Jun that the Accused wanted Dai Jun to settle the overtime matter. Li Bin added that he wanted the inspections to go through as soon as possible and did not want the Accused to be unhappy over the overtime issue and make things difficult for him. Dai Jun responded that he would settle the matter. [\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31)

30     Huang testified that in May or June 2017, he was at the corridor outside the second level site office when the Accused told him that the Accused had reported earlier for work but that Chiu Teng did not want to pay him his salary. The Accused added that if this problem were not settled, he would make sure Glory would suffer a loss of 20 percent. Huang surmised that the Accused wanted him to inform Dai Jun of this and did so soon after. Huang testified that he believed the Accused was able to cause Glory to suffer a loss by delaying work progress.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

31     According to the witnesses, at the material time, the Accused was also giving the contractors a hard time when it came to inspection of work done. One example was that concerning the construction of an underground water tank for collection and storage of rainwater. This water tank was constructed by Glory after piling works were completed. Although the original approved design only required normal concrete to be used for the construction of the tank, CPG accepted the Accused’s recommendation that waterproof concrete be used instead, resulting in delay of about two weeks.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)

32     When part of the works for the water tank was completed, Huang informed Li Bin that it was ready for inspection. After first inspecting the water tank himself, Li Bin proceeded to complete the paperwork and approached the Accused on the second level of the site office to request for inspection. According to Huang, the RTO had first inspected the work done and did not note any issues. Li Bin recalled that the Accused looked at the tank from his office (which overlooked the area where the tank was located) and told Li Bin that there was a lot of water on the tank and asked Li Bin to have the water cleared before proceeding for inspection. Huang immediately arranged for workers to pump the water out of the tank and clear the area with a “blower”. After that, Li Bin brought Huang with him to see the Accused to request for inspection again. However, the Accused was still not satisfied that the water had been cleared and declined to proceed with inspection. Huang called Dai Jun to report this to him. Huang testified that he then went with Li Bin to look for the Accused in the office to plead with him to allow Glory to proceed with pouring the concrete for the water tank as not doing so would result in delay as well as wastage of labour costs. According to Huang, the Accused replied in Mandarin, saying that “if you do not help me to settle my problem, then I will not be able to help you to settle your problem”. Huang called Dai Jun again to inform him of what the Accused said. Li Bin recalled that the Accused proceeded to inspect the water tank the following day. He overheard the Accused telling Huang that he had an issue with overtime pay and asked Huang to speak to his boss about it. Li Bin again conveyed this to Yeo and Dai Jun with the request that they settle the matter as soon as possible.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

33     That was the last time Li Bin heard the Accused asking for overtime pay. He subsequently learnt from Dai Jun that the matter had been settled.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) As for Huang, it was a week later when Huang noticed that the Accused was not as strict when it came to inspection.[^36] Dai Jun had also told Huang that he had settled the issue with the Accused and asked Huang to “quickly” ask the Accused for inspection.[^37] Although Huang heard that Dai Jun had paid the Accused some money, he did not think that it was for the Accused’s overtime pay. This was because the Accused was still talking to him about not being paid his overtime pay sometime in July 2017.[^38]

34     GM Lim testified that sometime in March or April 2017, Dai Jun had shown him P5 and told him that the Accused was trying to claim payment from Chiu Teng for overtime work and phone bills. GM Lim handed P5 back to Dai Jun and told him that the Accused was not entitled to these payments. Subsequently, Yeo also came to GM Lim with P5 (and the Accused’s handphone bills in Exhibit P6) to enquire about the Accused’s claim for overtime pay. GM Lim again responded that the Accused should claim the money from CPG instead of Chiu Teng. In May or June 2017, Seaco Tan also approached GM Lim to discuss the Accused’s overtime claims and GM Lim gave him the same response.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

35     Aileen Tok, CPG’s Assistant Vice President for Risk Control testified that CPG did not have any records that the Accused had requested payment for his work in supervising the test pile. In any event, the Accused was not allowed to receive money from contractors and subcontractors.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40)

### Dai Jun paid the Accused $3,000

36     Dai Jun testified that when he visited the Project worksite during the piling works, he noticed that the piling rate was very low. Dai Jun explained that even though piling was not under Glory’s purview, he had to enquire about piling progress as he was in charge of the overall progress at the worksite. Zhong, who was Chiu Teng’s site supervisor then, reported to Dai Jun that the Accused had “a lot of problems” that needed to be resolved and sometimes would refuse to attend to inspections. Dai Jun told Yeo that as the project manager, Yeo was “the highest level in this site” and asked Yeo to settle the matter with the Accused. However, Yeo could not handle the matter.

37     Dai Jun was shown a handwritten note (P5) which stated that the Accused was being owed his overtime pay for work done before the piling started, and the amount was $3,000 for 12 days’ work at the rate of $250 per day. Li Bin and Huang also informed Dai Jun that the Accused kept asking them about the overtime pay each time they asked the Accused to go for inspection. Initially, Dai Jun instructed Zhong to convey to the Accused that the money should not be paid by Glory or Chiu Teng but by CPG. However, the Accused refused to accept this and insisted that Glory or Chiu Teng should be paying him. Dai Jun surmised that the Accused was deliberately delaying the piling works because of the payment.

38     Dai Jun proceeded to consult his supervisor, GM Lim, about the Accused’s request for overtime payment. GM Lim told Dai Jun not to pay and let the project manager handle the matter instead. However, Dai Jun was worried that dire consequences would follow if the matter was not resolved, and this might negatively impact the structural works. Hence, he told Zhong to inform the Accused that payment would be made on condition that the piling rate was allowed to increase to four to five piles a day. Zhong returned to inform Dai Jun that the Accused was agreeable to this.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41)

39     Dai Jun subsequently arranged to meet the Accused at a coffeeshop opposite the Project worksite. At the meeting, the Accused told Dai Jun he was asking for $250 per day of overtime work. After remarking that the Accused’s rates were very expensive, Dai Jun informed the Accused he had the cash, but the Accused told him not to make payment at the coffeeshop as there were many people around. Dai Jun emphasised to the Accused that after the matter was settled, the Accused must help ensure that there was no delay to the piling works and the piling rate must be maintained at four to five piles daily. The Accused agreed. Dai Jun paid the Accused $3,000 (in $50 notes) in one of the toilet cubicles behind the site office. This payment was made sometime around March or April 2017. Thereafter, Dai Jun informed Li Bin and Huang that the issue concerning the Accused’s overtime pay was resolved.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42)

40     GM Lim and Dai Jun testified that Dai Jun was given an advance of $5,000 in petty cash, and had the discretion to spend any amount below $5,000 without having to obtain GM Lim’s permission. Dai Jun would make a claim for reimbursement from Glory thereafter. Further, Dai Jun would usually carry about $2,000 to $3,000 in cash with him to pay for work expenses.

41     Dai Jun testified that after paying the $3,000 to the Accused, he made a claim for reimbursement by furnishing a hand-written note in Chinese dated 12 April 2017 to claim for “site entertainment expenses, meals and miscellaneous expenses” (Exhibit P3). On the same day, Dai Jun also filled up a voucher for the $3,000 claim stating that it was for “entertainment expenses” (Exhibit P4). He submitted this claim together with other claims for the month and was reimbursed by Glory thereafter.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43)

42     In Court, Dai Jun explained that he did not record the payment to the Accused as overtime pay because it was not a “formal” payment to the Accused like a salary where there would be proper documentation and payment acknowledged by the recipient. In this instance, Dai Jun could not state in writing that he had paid the Accused overtime pay as this was in fact “money that would benefit” the Accused which he had paid so as not to offend the Accused.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44)

### Other requests from the Accused

43     Aside from his demand to be paid overtime by the contractors, the Accused also made other requests.

44     Li Bin and Huang highlighted that the Accused had asked them for a refrigerator. Huang informed Dai Jun of this and Dai Jun subsequently drove the Accused to buy one. Dai Jun explained that as the Accused was in charge of the site, and the contractors were subordinate to him, he would try his best not to offend the Accused. The refrigerator was placed within the accused’s partition in the site office.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45)

45     Dai Jun and Huang testified that the Accused asked for a roast pig to be provided to him.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) Huang also recalled that the Accused requested that his food be purchased for him. Glory designated a worker to do so and even bought a bicycle for the worker’s use to make purchases.[^47]

46     According to Dai Jun, the Accused had asked for assistance to procure an in-car camera as well as health supplements from China. These requests were acceded to and paid for by Dai Jun.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

47     The Accused also submitted documents to the contractors to claim for his personal handphone bills and the cost of petrol as he had driven his own car to attend a laboratory test relating to the Project.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

### Dai Jun paid the Accused $1,500

48     About one to two months after he had given the Accused $3,000, Dai Jun was informed by the administrative staff at the site office that the Accused had submitted some phone bills to claim for payment. The phone bills were handed to Dai Jun, who noted that each bill was for a small sum of around $50. According to Dai Jun, Huang subsequently told him that when Huang went to see the Accused for inspection purposes, the Accused mentioned that it was difficult to even claim for small sums of money and threatened to make the contractors incur a 20 percent loss. Dai Jun felt that the matter was becoming serious because he had already made payment of $3,000 to the Accused and the Accused was still asking for more.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50)

49     Dai Jun was concerned that the Accused was hindering work progress and picking on Glory. In Court, Dai Jun explained that he thought that by settling the Accused’s demand for overtime pay, things could move forward. On the contrary, the Accused found even more problems and made things difficult for the contractors such that they had no choice but to comply with the Accused’s wishes as the Accused wielded the “biggest powers” on site. Dai Jun therefore arranged to meet the Accused again at the coffeeshop opposite the Project worksite sometime in late June or early July. Dai Jun told the Accused that the Accused could not keep on asking for money and, after bargaining with the Accused, offered to pay the Accused a maximum of $1,500 per month to cover all his potential claims and requests. Dai Jun also told the Accused not to be too strict with work that did not involve drawings as Glory could not afford any more delay. The Accused agreed. Dai Jun then began to record the rest of his conversation with the Accused surreptitiously using his handphone. The recording and transcripts (with translations) were admitted into evidence as Exhibits P7 and P8[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) respectively.[^52]

50     Dai Jun and the Accused then left the coffee shop and returned to the worksite where Dai Jun gave the Accused $1,500 in $50 notes in the project manager’s room at level one of the site office.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) Dai Jun subsequently claimed for reimbursement of this sum from Glory by submitting a handwritten note dated 3 July 2017 stating that the claim was for expenditure on meals in June 2017 (Exhibit P9).[^54]

### The matter was reported to the authorities

51     According to Dai Jun, after paying the Accused $1,500, work went on smoothly for one week at the worksite. Thereafter, the Accused made things difficult again. This made Dai Jun very angry and anxious as he felt that the Accused had “extorted” money from him and yet still made things difficult for him. Dai Jun went to confront the Accused in the office to demand that the Accused return him the money or resign from his post. Dai Jun threatened to report the matter to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) if the Accused refused. The Accused challenged Dai Jun to do so and said that Dai Jun was a “China man” who could not prevail over him. Dai Jun retorted that he would rather lose his job in Singapore than let the Accused get away with this.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

52     Seaco Tan recalled that sometime in late July or August 2017, Dai Jun mentioned that he did not want to continue an “arrangement” he had with the Accused.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) On 4 August 2017, Seaco Tan received a WhatsApp message (P13) from the Accused telling him that the Accused’s “outstanding issue” was still not settled. When Seaco Tan met up with him subsequently at the Project site, the Accused again mentioned the overtime pay for load test pile. At that time, the project team (including Yeo and Li Bin) were experiencing issues with delay and clearing the inspection of work on site. As Seaco Tan was concerned about antagonising the Accused if he informed the latter that there was no agreement to pay, he told the Accused instead that he would check with his office again.[^57]

53     About a week to ten days after his confrontation with the Accused, Dai Jun confessed to GM Lim about the payments he made to the Accused using petty cash and admitted that he had made a mistake. GM Lim was very angry and asked Dai Jun why he had done this. Dai Jun was “very sad” and explained that he had “no choice” because the Accused was making work on-site very difficult. Dai Jun did not divulge the amount or the number of times he had paid the Accused. GM Lim asked Dai Jun if he had any evidence and Dai Jun forwarded P7 to him via WhatsApp. GM Lim proceeded to inform Brian Lim of the matter and furnished P5, P7 and photocopies of the Accused’s phone bills to Brian Lim.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58)

54     Dai Jun requested that Li Bin arrange for a meeting with the Accused. Dai Jun testified that he wanted to meet the Accused to let him know that he had an audio recording so that the Accused would resign from the Project. Dai Jun also wanted to tell the Accused that he could help the Accused get another job. The meeting took place at about 7 to 8 pm at a coffeeshop near Clementi MRT Station. The Accused came with a friend for the meeting. During the meeting, Dai Jun sat with the Accused while Li Bin sat a distance away. After listening to the audio recording at the meeting, the Accused remarked that they were on the same boat and this would hurt both of them. The Accused added that the recording merely showed that they were talking. He added that if Dai Jun did not deny paying him, both of them would “die together” and Dai Jun’s culpability was higher than his. Dai Jun retorted that even if he had to go back to China after 22 years in Singapore and never be able to return, he would still expose the Accused.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59)

55     In October 2017, Dai Jun and GM Lim both made statutory declarations concerning the Accused (Exhibits P10 and P21 respectively) and submitted the same through their lawyers to the CPIB.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60)

56     Subsequently, pursuant to the investigation officer’s request for documentary records, GM Lim attempted to locate the petty cash claims made by Dai Jun in relation to the payments to the Accused. Having sieved through Dai Jun’s petty cash claims in the preceding months, GM Lim identified P3, P4 and P9 to be the ones likely to be related to the payments to the Accused. In Court, GM Lim explained that was his “guess” as Dai Jun had written “entertainment” as the basis for these claims. GM Lim also retrieved Exhibit P19, which was his compilation of the claims made by his staff for the month of July 2017, as well as Exhibit P20, which showed that he had been reimbursed by Glory for the same.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61)

### The Accused’s request for part-time work and the project at 147 Moulmein Road

57     Sometime in March or April 2017, the Accused asked Dai Jun whether there was any part-time work available at other worksites. In order to stay in the Accused’s “good books” Dai Jun agreed to keep a look out for such work for the Accused. Dai Jun also mentioned the Accused’s request to GM Lim.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

58     At that time, Glory was involved in a project to reconstruct a private residential property at 147 Moulmein Road (“Moulmein Project”) and Dai Jun was the site manager. According to the prosecution witnesses, construction works for the Moulmein Project commenced around June 2017. The consultant for the Moulmein Project was KCL Consultants Pte Ltd (“KCL”) and Glory was the main contractor. Besides Dai Jun and GM Lim, the following witnesses who were acquainted with the Moulmein Project were also called to give evidence concerning the Accused’s involvement therein:[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

59     According to Dai Jun, he told the Accused that if the Accused was interested, he could introduce the Accused to work as part-time RTO for the Moulmein Project to earn extra income. Dai Jun and GM Lim also told Yew, who was assisting Glory with sub-contracts for the Moulmein Project, about the Accused’s availability for part-time work. Yew in turn told Cui Zhe about the Accused, and proceeded to obtain the Accused’s particulars so that he could be registered as the RE or RTO for the Moulmein Project.

60     As far as Dai Jun was aware, the Accused was not involved in the Moulmein Project although a foreman had once spotted the Accused at the worksite in May or June 2017 and sent Dai Jun a photograph to inform him. Dai Jun had never seen the Accused at the Moulmein Project and the Accused did not approach him for payment for work done in relation to the Moulmein Project.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64)

61     GM Lim testified that while the Accused was registered with the Building and Construction Authority (“BCA”) as the RE for the Moulmein Project from 9 April to 11 May 2017, he had never done any work at the worksite. According to Cui Zhe, the Accused had signed the demolition permit application form which was submitted to the BCA. KCL had issued an appointment letter to the Accused but he returned it unsigned. Cui Zhe testified that if the Accused were the RE for the project, the Accused would have to report to him. However, Cui Zhe had neither seen the Accused attend any meetings for the Moulmein Project nor sign any site inspection records. Instead, it was Winston Heng, the RTO appointed for the Moulmein Project, who attended the project meetings regularly and signed all the inspection forms. Further, there was also no record of the Accused’s attendance on-site at the Moulmein Project.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65)

62     Winston Heng testified that he was registered as the RTO for the Moulmein Project in February 2017. He first met the Accused at the nursing home worksite when Dai Jun brought him to speak with the Accused and check on the latter’s availability to serve as the RE or RTO for the Moulmein Project. They did not discuss the Accused’s remuneration. Winston Heng testified that as the RTO for the Moulmein Project, he did not report to an RE. Instead, Winston Heng was the one who conducted the inspection of the works for the Moulmein Project from the start of the demolition works until the Temporary Occupation Permit was issued and the works were completed. Winston Heng told the Court that during this time, he had never encountered the Accused at the Moulmein Project worksite, nor had he come across any documents signed by the Accused.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66)

### The incident during the trial

63     Huang testified that when he first came to Court on 14 January 2020 at about 12.30pm, he chanced upon the Accused, Li Bin and a lady leaving the State Courts building together. When Huang greeted the Accused and walked over to him, the Accused told Huang “When you go into the Court, don’t any how say things. They wanted me to go to jail. In Court, you can only say your workers do not know how to work. Some of the things when they ask, you just say you do not know, you are not sure, or you forgot.” Huang asked the Accused why he was blowing up the matter and did not further engage him.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)

64     When Li Bin was recalled to give evidence concerning this incident, he confirmed that he met the Accused, who was with a lady, in the lobby of the State Courts after leaving the courtroom during lunch break. The Accused told him that they were on such familiar terms and he should not have complained against the Accused in Court. Li Bin responded saying that since the matter was before the Court, they should not talk about their past relationship. Li Bin added that he was just speaking the truth. They ran into Huang after exiting the building and Li Bin heard the Accused telling Huang “I have treated you so well” and said that Huang should not speak ill of him in Court. Huang responded by saying that it was not his wish to come to Court as well.[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68)

## The case for the defence

65     At the close of the prosecution’s case, I found that the prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against the Accused on the two proceeded charges and called upon him to give evidence in his own defence. The Accused elected to testify. The Accused also called Mr Gan Thiam Chye (DW2, “Mr Gan”) as a witness for the defence. As the defence’s case rested, in the main, on the Accused’s testimony, his evidence is summarised below:

### The Accused did not delay the piling works

66     The Accused denied causing any delay to the piling works. He explained that CPG needed time to conduct checks before informing him to proceed with casting of the pile and this might have caused a delay of an hour or two.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69)

67     During cross-examination, the Accused further explained that when boring was completed for the pile, time was required to verify the soil samples against the soil report. Thereafter, calculations would be done before submission to Kew for approval. Only after this could casting commence. Further, it was the rainy season and water ponding at the worksite hindered the movement of machinery and pace of work.[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70)

68     The Accused agreed that the cut-off time for inspection of the piling works was initially set at 3.30pm. According to him, the cut-off time was set by agreement between CPG and Chiu Teng and not by him.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71)

### The Accused never received his overtime pay

69     The Accused testified that Jean Ho had requested his assistance to supervise the pile load test prior to him formally starting his employment with CPG on 6 February 2017. The test piling took place over three to four days. The Accused discussed the matter with Goh and requested for reimbursement as he had taken time off from his previous job to supervise the test piling. In response, Goh asked the Accused for a report on the test piling dates. The Accused proceeded to write this down on a page he had torn out from his notebook and handed it to Goh. The Accused identified P5 as the piece of paper he handed to Goh and affirmed that the contents were written by him except for the circled numerals, as well as the words “RE OT” and “12 day -- $250 per day”.[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72)

70     The Accused informed Goh that he only wanted to claim payment for three days’ work before he joined CPG. However, he did not tell Goh how much he wanted to claim per day but asked Goh to pro-rate the amount based on his monthly salary. The Accused also spoke to Yeo and Dai Jun about the overtime payment and questioned why they were not settling this matter for him. The Accused never told Goh or anyone else that he was claiming for 12 days’ overtime pay. The Accused further explained that he expected Glory or Chiu Teng to propose a figure and reach a compromise with him. He also sent Seaco Tan WhatsApp messages on 3 May and 4 August 2017 (P13) to ask Seaco Tan to settle his overtime pay. Despite these, the Accused never received any payment for his overtime work. Specifically, the Accused denied meeting with Dai Jun at the coffeeshop opposite the Project worksite sometime in March 2017 or receiving $3,000 from Dai Jun.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73)

71     During cross-examination, the Accused disagreed that the understanding was that he would not be paid overtime by CPG for work done before 6 February 2017. According to the Accused, he could have asked Jean Ho for payment. In fact, Jean Ho subsequently admitted to him that this was an administrative mistake on the part of CPG. However, the Accused agreed that he neither discussed nor made a claim with anyone from CPG for work done before 6 February 2017.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74)

72     The Accused reiterated that he was merely asking the contractors to reimburse him “some allowance” for services provided by him prior to formally starting work on 6 February 2017. As the Accused felt that he was entitled to payment for his time and efforts, he was determined to get paid. However, as he was only claiming a small sum of a few hundred dollars, he was not upset when he did not receive any payment.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75)

### The Accused raised many issues concerning the work done at the Project worksite

73     Upon starting work proper on the Project, the Accused noticed that scheduling and planning of work was poorly done. Further, he felt “very pressurised” as he found the staff on-site such as Li Bin and Yeo to be incompetent and doubted their ability to perform. As this was a public project, the Accused had to be very strict with compliance so as to ensure that no accident happened on-site which might result in a stop work order.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76)

74     In the beginning, the Accused refrained from complaining and tried to highlight and discuss issues spotted on-site with the contractors. However, when instances of non-compliance increased in frequency, the Accused resorted to issuing site memos (see Exhibit D2[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77)) as a warning to the contractors and to ensure that they performed the necessary rectification works. Upon rectification, further inspection would be conducted and if everything was in order, the issue would be closed. The Accused would also highlight the problems identified in the memos for discussion at the weekly site meetings.[^78]

75     As for the underground water tank, the Accused had merely suggested that waterproof concrete be used and the final decision was not made by him.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79)

### The Accused was paid $1000 for his work as RTO in the project at 147 Moulmein Road

76     During the course of his work in the Project, the Accused mentioned to Zhong that he wanted to look for a part-time job to supplement his income. Dai Jun eventually learnt of his request. Sometime in April 2017, the Accused received an email from Yew requesting that the Accused fill up a form to register himself as RE for the Moulmein Project and to apply for a Work Commencement Permit for the demolition works. The Accused understood that he would serve as RE or RTO only for the demolition works while another RTO would be appointed for the building works. However, the Accused never received any appointment letter. The Accused had also met Winston Heng at the nursing home Project worksite to discuss the Moulmein Project and Winston Heng had asked him how much he would charge for performing the RTO role. The Accused replied that he would charge a lump sum between $3,000 to $5,000 for two to three months’ work. Having been registered for the Moulmein Project, the Accused was added into a WhatsApp group chat on 6 April 2017 (see Exhibit D3). The Accused went to the worksite to check on safety issues and earth-control measures. He also went through the drawings and highlighted the issues he identified in the WhatsApp group chat but the rest in the group did not respond to his messages or bother to take any action. The Accused was removed from the chat group on 11 May 2017, right after he sent his third message. Since then, the Accused would contact Dai Jun to check on the progress of the work.[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) According to the Accused, he was on good terms with Dai Jun in May and June 2017. It was only in July 2017, after receiving many memos issued by the Accused, that their relationship deteriorated.[^81]

77     Upon starting work in the first week of May 2017, the Accused would visit the Moulmein Project worksite at least twice a week, either in the morning, during his lunch hours between 11.30am and 1pm, or after work on a Saturday afternoon. He had met a “China man” at the worksite and asked for a document to record his attendance. The Accused also did his own “recording” using his phone. During cross-examination the Accused added that he recorded his attendance in a small notebook. The Accused worked in the Moulmein Project for about two months but had never met Winston Heng or Yew at the worksite. The Accused did not sign any document during the course of the demolition works at the Moulmein Project as none was submitted to him. Additionally, since the demolition works were minor, the Accused did not have to report to or consult the professional engineer. He also did not attend the progress meetings for the Moulmein Project because nobody informed him of the meetings. The Accused believed the others did not want him there as he would “say a lot” at such meetings.[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82)

78     Sometime around 3 June 2017, the Accused asked Dai Jun to claim $1,500 on his behalf as his salary for the Moulmein Project. However, Dai Jun only made a single payment to him of $1,000 and told him that the balance $500 would be settled next time. The Accused was not aware of the source of the $1,000 payment.[\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83)

### The Accused did not accept Dai Jun’s offer of $1,500

79     Sometime in July 2017 (after Dai Jun had paid him for the Moulmein Project), the Accused was having lunch alone at the food court opposite the nursing home Project worksite when Dai Jun came to complain to him that RTO Lim was rejecting all his work. The Accused explained to Dai Jun that he could not override RTO Lim’s decision and urged Dai Jun to improve the workmanship instead. The Accused sensed that Dai Jun was behaving abnormally during their conversation and was very surprised when Dai Jun later offered to pay him $1,500 per month to be lenient during inspection. The Accused responded by asking Dai Jun why he made such an offer and suggested that Dai Jun “better go and do something to please \[the\] RTO”. The Accused agreed that this was the meeting at which, unknown to him, part of their conversation was being recorded by Dai Jun, as set out in the transcripts in P8. The Accused emphasised that he did not accept any money from Dai Jun and that he was only joking with Dai Jun when he asked the latter why the payment was for structural works only. He decided to humour Dai Jun as he could not show his unhappiness to Dai Jun. He understood that Dai Jun was trying to “buy \[his\] heart” but told Dai Jun that there was no point in doing so. In fact, even after this meeting, the Accused continued his practice of issuing site memos against the contractors.[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84)

80     The Accused added that RTO Lim had higher expectations and his standards and those of RTO Lim’s were “totally different”. RTO Lim would be unhappy if the Accused were to ask him about the failed inspections. Also, RTO Lim had on several occasions refused to conduct further inspections and asked the Accused to do so himself. The Accused, on the other hand, was willing to “compromise” his standards a little as it was not possible to expect Glory or Dai Jun to be able to perform up to the Accused’s usual standards.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85)

81     The Accused agreed that there was a confrontation between him and Dai Jun in the site office but it concerned the $1,000 Dai Jun had paid him for the Moulmein Project. Dai Jun threatened the Accused saying that if the Accused were to make things difficult, he would report the Accused to the authorities for accepting this payment. The other alternative was for the Accused to resign. The Accused retorted that this was his pay for the Moulmein Project which he was entitled to and he did not do anything wrong.[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86)

82     Subsequently, Li Bin arranged for the Accused to meet with Dai Jun at a coffeeshop in Clementi. According to the Accused, this was because he told Dai Jun if the latter could not perform, he would change the entire sub-contractor team. This led to Dai Jun quarrelling with the Accused at the worksite. The Accused got his friend, Mr Gan, to accompany him for the meeting, and they sat at a round table with Li Bin and Dai Jun at the coffeeshop.[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87)

83     Dai Jun asked the Accused to resign because he was in possession of a recording. The Accused retorted that he did not take any money from Dai Jun and challenged Dai Jun to go ahead and report the matter. Dai Jun then played the recording. After listening to it, the Accused dismissed it as “nonsense” and accused Dai Jun of attempting to entrap him.[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88)

### The Accused’s encounter with Li Bin and Huang during the trial

84     As for his encounter with Li Bin and Huang on 14 January 2020, the Accused testified that it was mere coincidence and he had no intention of influencing them at all. After he and Huang greeted each other, the Accused questioned why he was being accused when his suggestion to purchase a roast pig and plant vegetables on vacant land were for the workers’ benefit. The Accused told Huang that he “better go and tell the truth … don’t anyhow accuse people.” He also asked Li Bin why he was being accused based on the transportation claim.[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89)

## Analysis of the evidence and the Court’s findings

### The Law

85     Section 6(a) of the PCA stated:

> **6.**  If —

>> (_a_)    any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business;

>> …

>> he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

86     To prove the charges against the Accused, the prosecution had to prove the following elements of the offences beyond a reasonable doubt:[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90)

> (a)     First element – the Accused (as an agent) obtained or accepted gratification;

> (b)     Second element – as an inducement for the Accused to forebear to do an act in relation to his principal’s (CPG’s) affairs, _to wit_, (i) by not causing delay in piling works carried out at the Project construction site and (ii) by not creating problems for Glory in its works carried out at the construction site;

> (c)     Third element – there was an objective corrupt element in the transactions;

> (d)     Fourth element – the Accused acted with guilty knowledge.

87     The first element would be the _actus reas_ of the offences while the other three elements pertained to the _mens rea_ of the Accused.

88     The second and third elements would normally form part of the same factual enquiry and the test was an objective one, based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. In conducting the enquiry, the Court would find or infer what the offender intended when he entered into the transaction. [\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91) In the present case, the question essentially was whether the Accused received the gratifications as a _quid pro quo_ for forbearing to inflict harm on the contractors. The surrounding circumstances of the case such as surreptitiousness or furtiveness of the transaction, the size of the gratification, relationship of the parties, would, where relevant, assist the judge in inferring what the intentions of the parties were.[^92] While the contravention of some rules or laws could assist the Court in deciding whether the intended transaction was corrupt according to the objective criteria, a corrupt element would not be constituted merely because there had been a contravention of the rules or laws.[^93] On the other hand, the Court would look beyond the pretext or guise which the parties clothe the transaction with, to determine the presence of an objective corrupt element in the transaction and the true nature of the arrangement.[^94]

89     The fourth element of guilty knowledge referred to whether the Accused knew or realised what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard, and the test was a subjective one.[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95)

90     In relation to a charge under section 6(a) of the PCA, once the above elements have been proven, section 9(a) of the PCA provided that the recipient (i.e. the Accused) would be guilty of the relevant offence notwithstanding that the recipient did not have the power, right or opportunity or the intention to do any act or show or forbear to show any favour or disfavour to any person, or that the recipient did not in fact do so.

### Overview of the assessment of evidence

91     In the present case, both the _actus reas_ and _mens rea_ elements in the two proceeded charges were in dispute. As my decision would largely turn on whether I accepted Dai Jun’s or the Accused’s evidence, I had closely scrutinised their testimony in Court. In evaluating their credibility as witnesses and the veracity of their evidence, I considered their demeanour; the internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the contents of their evidence; and the external consistency (or lack thereof) between the contents of their evidence and extrinsic evidence (including evidence of other witnesses and documentary evidence).

92     Having carefully reviewed Dai Jun’s evidence, I found that he had testified in a forthright and candid manner. His evidence that he had given the corrupt gratifications to the Accused remained unshaken during cross-examination. In evaluating Dai Jun’s evidence, I had also considered the contents of his statutory declaration in P10. In particular, I noted that there were some discrepancies such as that in paragraph \[21\] stating that the Accused was the one who asked to meet at the coffeeshop near the construction site, and paragraph \[24\] stating that the payment of $1,500 was in exchange for the Accused expediting the inspection of piling works. Having carefully assessed the evidence, I found the discrepancies to be minor and immaterial, and did not at all render Dai Jun’s overall credibility suspect. I was also mindful that when testifying in Court, Dai Jun was unable to recollect with precision, the dates or sequence of certain events relating to the payments he made to the Accused. However, given the passage of time between those events in 2017 and the trial which commenced in 2020, coupled with the undisputed fact that Dai Jun was overseeing several projects concurrently at the material time, I was of the view that this did not render his testimony on the material facts unreliable.

93     Indeed, in the course of Dai Jun’s testimony, his sense of frustration with the Accused and the situation he and his co-workers found themselves in during the period of the offences became apparent and pulpable in Court. More importantly, his evidence was corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses as well as objective, contemporaneous evidence. As pointed out by the prosecution in their submissions, there was really no reason for Dai Jun to put his career and his life in Singapore in jeopardy, as well as risk being prosecuted in Court, by confessing to offences which he himself never committed, in order to frame the Accused. This was especially so in the context of the $3,000 payment.

94     On the other hand, I was unconvinced by the Accused’s insistence that he had never obtained or accepted any payment from Dai Jun, aside from $1,000 which was his salary for the Moulmein Project. Not only was the Accused’s case unsupported by external or objective evidence, his testimony was contradicted in material aspects by evidence given by the prosecution witnesses, some of whom, he accepted, had no reason to lie against him. Furthermore, certain parts of the Accused’s testimony in Court were either inconsistent with the defence’s case put to the prosecution witnesses or his version stated in his statements given to the CPIB. In fact, it was apparent that the Accused was, at times, making up his evidence during the trial. An example was when the Accused first alleged, during the defence case, that RTO Lim was much stricter than him with inspection and that RTO Lim had refused to conduct further inspections and asked the Accused to do so himself on several occasions. It was telling that these assertions were never put to any of the prosecution witnesses, including RTO Lim. In my view, this indicated that they were afterthoughts on the Accused’s part.

95     I shall set out the details of my analysis and findings below, starting with the _actus reas_ in relation to the two charges before moving on to the _mens rea_ elements.

### Actus Reas

#### The Accused obtained a gratification of $3,000 from Dai Jun

96     To recap, the prosecution’s case in relation to the first charge was that the Accused had caused delay in the piling works by setting an early cut-off time for inspection. At the same time, the Accused was doggedly asking Chiu Teng and Glory’s staff for payment for work done in relation to test piling and submitted P5 in support of his claim. To resolve the issue, Dai Jun paid the Accused $3,000 based on the entries in P5, on condition that there be no further delay to the piling works and that the piling rate would be maintained at four to five piles a day.

97     The defence, on the other hand, contended that the Accused had no say in the cut-off time for inspection and did not deliberately cause any delay to the piling works. Although it was not disputed that he had asked to be paid for overtime work by Chiu Teng, he was only claiming payment for three days’ work. Furthermore, the Accused never received any payment.

98     In their closing submissions, the defence challenged the premise for the payment and argued that there was no evidence that the Accused had deliberately delayed the piling works. During the trial, the defence’s case put to Dai Jun was that it was due to other factors that the contractors were only able to produce one to two piles a day for inspection by the Accused. The defence had also put to Dai Jun that the Accused did not have the authority to decide on the cut-off time for inspection and in fact could not even provide his views on the same but was merely following the instructions of Chiu Teng and CPG.[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96)

99     As pointed out by the prosecution in their submissions, the Accused’s version was directly contradicted by the evidence given by Ravi, Li Bin, Goh, GM Lim, and Yeo, all of whom testified that the Accused was the one who had set the cut-off time for pile inspection at 3.30pm. The witnesses also testified that this cut-off time contributed to the delay in piling works on-site. Contrary to the defence’s assertion in their submissions that Ravi’s evidence clearly showed that the Accused did not do anything intentionally to cause delay to the piling works, Ravi had testified unequivocally that the initial delay in the piling works was due, in part, to the early cut-off time set by the Accused. Pertinently, his testimony in this regard was not challenged by the defence during cross-examination.

100    In Court, the Accused shifted from the case put to Dai Jun that he had “no say” in the cut-off time and testified that he was the one who suggested the cut-off time to the piling contractors for consideration. However, he maintained that the 3.30pm cut-off time was not set by him but by agreement between CPG and Chiu Teng.[\[note: 97\]](#Ftn_97) The Accused’s testimony in this regard was inconsistent with his statement in P26, which he gave to CPIB on 22 November 2017. Therein, he admitted that he was the one who set the cut-off time of 3.30pm for inspection, and even added that this was his “standard”.[^98] When pressed, the Accused was unable to provide a cogent explanation for the disparate versions but claimed that he \`simply said “yes” when asked if he set the cut-off time because he did not want to elaborate on “complicated” construction issues which a layman could not understand.[^99]

101    Next, the Accused’s assertion that the cut-off time was approved by CPG and Chiu Teng, ran contrary to the evidence given by Kew and Jean Ho which showed that they were not even aware of the 3.30pm cut-off time purportedly endorsed by CPG. Instead, Jean Ho, the Accused’s reporting officer, had testified that in her personal opinion, this cut-off time was wrong. Tellingly, the defence’s case that this timing was agreed upon between CPG and Chiu Teng was also never put to Kew, Jean Ho or GM Lim.

102    In my view, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that the Accused was lying when he claimed that the initial cut-off time at 3.30pm was not set by him. Further, the Accused’s attempt to distance himself from the early cut-off time pointed to his guilty knowledge and reinforced the prosecution’s case that the Accused had deliberately set an inappropriately early timing for inspection, knowing that this would hinder the progress of piling works.

103    During the trial and in their submissions, the defence sought to cast doubt on Dai Jun’s evidence that he had made payment to the Accused to ensure that there was no delay in the piling works, by pointing to the fact that Glory was not involved in piling. When questioned concerning this in Court, Dai Jun explained that he was overall in charge of work progress at the construction site and Zhong was reporting to him on the slow pace of the piling works.[\[note: 100\]](#Ftn_100) GM Lim (who held management roles in both Chiu Teng and Glory) also testified that he had asked Dai Jun to help supervise the piling works as he was more experienced than the site engineers. Furthermore, any delay in piling works would also impact the progress of structural works.[^101] Having carefully considered Dai Jun and GM Lim’s evidence against the surrounding facts and circumstances, I did not find it odd or incongruous for Dai Jun to have taken it upon himself to attempt to resolve the Accused’s payment issues in order to avoid further delay to the piling works.

104    Turning to the Accused’s request for overtime pay, although he did not dispute that he had repeatedly asked for payment from the contractors’ staff, he sought to downplay his insistence by describing the sum involved as a “small amount” and explaining that he was only trying to see if Chiu Teng would pay him some “allowance” for his services. In Court, the Accused also portrayed a nonchalant attitude towards the payment stating that “If they want to pay me, I would take it, if they don’t pay me, I just leave it that’s all”.[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102) However, this flew in the face of the undisputed evidence that over several months, the Accused had persistently raised the issue of his claim to several staff from Chiu Teng and Glory, including Goh, Li Bin, Huang, Yeo, and Seaco Tan. This resulted in the issue of his overtime claim being repeatedly brought to the attention of GM Lim by the senior members of his staff, including Dai Jun. The Accused’s preoccupation with his claim was demonstrated by him sending Seaco Tan a message on 3 May 2017 to “settle” the issue followed by a reminder three months later on 4 August 2017 that his “outstanding issue \[was\] still not settled yet…”.[^103] Indeed, when the Accused was asked directly by the prosecution whether he was “determined” to get the sum of money, he conceded that this was correct..[^104]

105    The Accused also sought to dispute Dai Jun’s evidence by insisting that he was only claiming a smaller sum for three days’ overtime work. Having carefully reviewed the evidence in this regard, it was clear to me that Dai Jun did not come up with the sum of $3,000 on his own accord. Instead, the genesis of this amount could be traced back to a chain of events which occurred after the Accused had handed P5 to Goh in support of his claim. The evidence showed that when Goh passed P5 (which he regarded as the Accused’s “timesheet”) to Yeo, he told Yeo that the Accused was claiming overtime pay for test piling work at the rate of $250 per day. Thereafter, it was not disputed that Yeo wrote the words “12 day -- $250 per day” and “RE OT” in P5. According to Yeo, this was based on his own understanding of the series of dates written by the Accused in P5. Yeo also recalled that Goh had told him that the Accused was claiming for 12 days’ work. In view of the above, Dai Jun’s testimony that he paid the Accused $3,000 (i.e. 12 x $250) in accordance with what was written on P5 was both logical and plausible. On the other hand, the Accused’s contention that he had expressly told the contractors’ staff that he was only claiming for three days’ overtime work was unsupported by any extrinsic evidence, including P5.[\[note: 105\]](#Ftn_105) During the defence’s case, the Accused denied writing the circled numerals in P5, from “1” to “12”.[^106] However, not only was this never put to Goh (to whom he handed P5) or Yeo (who admitted to writing in P5), the Accused also did not mention this when his statement in P25 was recorded on 16 October 2017, even though he made expressed reference to entries in P5 which were not written by him.[^107] When pressed on this during cross-examination, the Accused changed his position and claimed that he could not remember whether the circled numerals were written by him.[^108]

106    On the other hand, Dai Jun’s evidence that the $3,000 was indeed paid to the Accused was further supported by his claim for reimbursement in P3, which was retrieved by GM Lim from Glory’s records. Indeed, GM Lim’s evidence was that initially, Dai Jun did not even tell him how much or how many times he had paid the Accused. GM Lim had himself made an educated guess and pulled out P3 (as well as P4). When he showed P3 to Dai Jun, Dai Jun confirmed that this was the claim he submitted in relation to a payment made to the Accused. In my view, this bolster Dai Jun’s evidence that he had made payment of $3,000 to the Accused sometime in March or April 2017, before submitting P3 to his employers for reimbursement on 12 April 2017.

107    In support of the Accused’s case that no payment was made, the defence also pointed to the fact that Dai Jun’s claim for reimbursement was not documented as overtime for the Accused, and the fact that no acknowledgement of payment was signed by the Accused. When asked to explain this in Court, Dai Jun admitted candidly that it was not possible for him to properly document this payment as these were not “formal” payments to the Accused. Instead, these were monies paid to “benefit” the Accused.[\[note: 109\]](#Ftn_109) Next, the defence questioned why Dai Jun was reimbursed by Glory instead of Chiu Teng, since Chiu Teng should be the one paying the Accused. With respect, the defence appeared to have misconstrued the prosecution’s case. The prosecution’s position was not that this payment was legitimately due to the Accused from either Chiu Teng or Glory, or that either company had agreed to pay the Accused the amount. In fact, Dai Jun had openly admitted in Court that he had defied GM Lim’s instructions not to pay the Accused as he was anxious to solve the problem. Further, as Dai Jun was employed by Glory (and not Chiu Teng), there was nothing strange or unusual in him claiming reimbursement from his employer. In fact, the overall surreptitious nature of payment and the lack of proper documentation was entirely consistent with and buttressed the prosecution’s case that this was a corrupt transaction.

108    Further, the fact that the Accused continued to demand for overtime payment even in August 2017 did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Dai Jun had never paid him the $3,000. On the contrary, it dovetailed Dai Jun’s exasperation with the Accused as being “greedy” and “shameless” in continuing with his demands for reimbursements and favours from the contractors even after he had received $3,000 from Dai Jun.[\[note: 110\]](#Ftn_110) It also reinforced the prosecution’s case that the Accused understood that the $3,000 given to him was _not_ overtime pay to which he was rightfully entitled, but as inducement to not cause delay in piling works carried out for the Project.

109    In conclusion, having carefully reviewed the evidence relating to the first charge, I found, as a fact that the Accused had indeed obtained a gratification of $3,000 from Dai Jun. Further, I accepted Dai Jun’s evidence that he had communicated to the Accused that the payment was premised on the Accused’s help to ensure that there be no delay in the piling works and at least four to five piles could be completed each day.[\[note: 111\]](#Ftn_111)

#### The Accused accepted a gratification of $1,500 from Dai Jun

110    Turning to the second charge, the prosecution’s case was that not long after paying $3,000 to the Accused, Dai Jun learnt that the Accused was again causing problems for the workers while making requests for reimbursements and other items from them. Being at his wits end and tired of having to meet the Accused’s myriad demands, Dai Jun offered to pay the Accused $1,500 per month until the end of the structural works as an inducement for the Accused not to cause trouble for Glory. According to Dai Jun, payment was made thereafter at the project manager’s room at the site office.

111    The defence did not dispute that Dai Jun had made the offer to the Accused or that P7 was a recording of their conversation. However, the Accused claimed that he had no intention to and did not accept any payment from Dai Jun. Instead, the only monies the Accused had ever received from Dai Jun was $1,000 in return for the Accused’s work in the Moulmein Project.

112    Having perused the transcripts of the conversation between Dai Jun and the Accused in P8, I found that the contents were consistent with, and corroborative of Dai Jun’s version that the Accused had accepted the payment from him. On the other hand, the Accused’s insistence that he did not accept Dai Jun’s offer did not sit well with the objective contents of P8. In particular, the following extracts from P8 were, in my view, compelling evidence that the Accused had accepted Dai Jun’s offer:

113    When confronted with P8 in Court, the Accused claimed that he was merely joking with, and humouring Dai Jun, as he could not show his unhappiness to Dai Jun. He also pointed to the “No, no” he uttered towards the end of the conversation as evidence that he had rejected Dai Jun’s offer. I was not persuaded by the Accused’s assertions. Firstly, as the RE representing the project consultants (and indirectly the project owners) at the worksite and being clothed with authority to supervise the work of the contractors, there was really no reason for the Accused to think that he had to pretend to go along with Dai Jun just to please him. Instead, it was clear from the transcripts that it was Dai Jun who was pleading with the Accused to pass Glory’s work during inspection. In fact, even the Accused acknowledged that he knew Dai Jun was trying to win his favour during this exchange.[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112) Secondly, the transcripts clearly showed that the Accused had agreed to contact Dai Jun to arrange for payment. Further, understood in its proper context, it was obvious that the Accused’s “No, no" was in relation to whether payment should be made there and then at the coffeeshop.

114    The prosecution’s case that Dai Jun had paid the Accused $1,500 was further corroborated by contemporaneous evidence in Dai Jun’s claim for reimbursement of the same amount dated 3 July 2017 (P9). Similar to P3 and P4, P9 was retrieved by GM Lim from Glory’s records. Further, that payment had indeed been made to the Accused was reinforced by Huang’s evidence that Dai Jun informed him that the issue with the Accused had been settled and told Huang to quickly submit work for inspection.

115    In addition, Dai Jun’s testimony that the Accused was inundating the contractors with a number of requests or demands, was supported by the accounts given by other prosecution witnesses. The witnesses have testified that within the span of a few months, the Accused had asked to be provided with the following by the contractors:

> (a)     a refrigerator;

> (b)     a roast pig;

> (c)     an in-car camera;

> (d)     health supplements;

> (e)     reimbursement for petrol costs (P22); and

> (f)     reimbursement of his handphone bills (P6).

116    During the trial, the Accused denied making any request for a refrigerator. Instead, he claimed that the refrigerator was purchased and placed outside his partitioned office “right in front” of RTO Lim and “everybody” including RTO Lim were using it.[\[note: 113\]](#Ftn_113) The Accused also denied claiming for reimbursement for petrol cost from Chiu Teng. Instead, he alleged that Li Bin had paid for the petrol after the Accused had driven them to Tuas and it was Li Bin who wanted Chiu Teng to pay him back.[^114] As for the in-car camera, it was Dai Jun who brought the camera to the Accused’s office. The Accused did not use it. In fact, Dai Jun offered the Accused many things, but he refused to accept them. The Accused also never made any request for or did he receive health supplements from Dai Jun. As for the roast pig, he was “just joking” when he asked Dai Jun to buy a roast pig for the workers to celebrate the first casting of the ground slab and the roast pig was not for him. However, it turned out that nobody ate it and it was all thrown inside his refrigerator. [^115] As for the basis for his claim for reimbursement for his phone bills in P6, the Accused contended that under the project contract, Chiu Teng was obliged to provide three handphones for on-site communications. As such, he and the RTO were advised to submit their handphone bills to Chiu Teng’s quantity surveyor and they did so together.[^116]

117    Having carefully studied the evidence, I found the Accused’s account contrived and unconvincing. His version concerning the claim for petrol, the purchase of the refrigerator, in-car camera and health supplements was never put to the prosecution witnesses. Instead, Dai Jun and Li Bin’s evidence that the refrigerator was requested for and used exclusively by the Accused dovetailed RTO Lim’s evidence that the refrigerator was placed within the Accused’s partitioned office and that RTO Lim had never used it at all.[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117) The Accused was also unable to substantiate his claim for the handphone bills. Apart from his bare assertions, he did not produce a shred of evidence supporting the legitimacy of his claim, including the alleged clauses in the contract with Chiu Teng obliging them to provide handphones.[^118] To the contrary, his employment contract with CPG expressly stated that his salary was inclusive of “mobile expenses”.[^119] The Accused’s evidence was also contradicted by RTO Lim, who testified that he had paid his own handphone bills and had “never” asked for reimbursement from Chiu Teng. In this connection, it was also curious to note that the Accused had even submitted his handphone bills dated 19 January 2017 (before he started work for CPG) as part of his claim.[^120] Having carefully assessed the evidence, I accepted the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses that even after Dai Jun had paid the Accused $3,000, the contractors found themselves at the receiving end of a series of requests or demands from the Accused and this drove Dai Jun to offer the Accused a monthly payment.

118    Next, the Accused’s assertion that Dai Jun had instead paid him $1,000 for his work at 147 Moulmein Road was unsupported by any objective evidence. His claim that he had performed work as RTO in the Moulmein Project for two months starting from May 2017 was contradicted by the evidence of all the witnesses who were closely associated with the project such as Dai Jun, Cui Zhe, and Winston Heng. In fact, it was undisputed that the Accused was removed from the WhatsApp group chat for the project as early as 11 May 2017 (see D3). When questioned about this in Court, the Accused alleged that he was removed from the group chat because the others did not like him to talk too much. In my view, the Accused’s removal from the project group chat was clear indication that he was not involved in the works in the Moulmein Project, at the very least, from that day onwards.

119    The Accused was also unable to provide any cogent explanation for the undisputed facts that:

> (a)     he had not signed any inspection forms or documents as RTO for the Moulmein Project,

> (b)     Dai Jun, Winston Heng and Cui Zhe had never met him on-site and there was no record of his attendance at the worksite,

> (c)     he had never once reported to the Cui Zhe, the Qualified Person for the Moulmein Project; and

> (d)     he had never attended a single project meeting.

120    Additionally, the Accused’s account of him visiting the Moulmein Project twice a week, either in the morning, during his lunch hours between 11.30am and 1pm, or after work on a Saturday afternoon, was inconsistent with the version he gave to CPIB on 16 October 2017 in P25, where he stated that he visited the site about three to four times a month usually on Saturday afternoons and sometimes after working hours.[\[note: 121\]](#Ftn_121) When asked to explain the discrepancy during cross-examination, the Accused further contradicted himself and claimed that he visited the Moulmein Project “three to four times a week” and “at least two to three times per week”.[^122] In my view, the Accused’s vacillations in his evidence concerning his attendance at the Moulmein Project clearly evinced that this was but an afterthought.

121    Further, putting aside the fact that the Accused was, by his own admission, asking for payment from a contractor he was tasked to supervise, the Accused was unable to explain the basis for his purported request for $1,500 from Dai Jun, which coincidentally, was the same amount Dai Jun offered to pay him on a monthly basis in P8. It was not disputed that the Accused did not sign any employment contract for the Moulmein Project nor had he confirmed the terms of his remuneration with anyone. Further, his testimony during cross-examination that he intended to charge $2,000 to $2,500 per month or a lump sum of between $3,000 to $5,000 for two to three months’ work[\[note: 123\]](#Ftn_123) was incongruent with the version in his statement in P25 that he had intended to charge around $3,000 for eight months’ work.[^124]

122    Finally, while the Accused claimed that, after his removal from the group chat, he contacted Dai Jun to be updated on work progress at the Moulmein Project, and this was why he approached Dai Jun for remuneration, these assertions were never put to Dai Jun by the defence. Having scrutinised the evidence, I agreed with the prosecution that the Accused’s account that he had asked Dai Jun for $1,500 as remuneration for the Moulmein Project and received only $1,000 was a red herring fabricated by the Accused to shore up his defence.

123    In summary, having carefully studied the evidence relating to the second charge, I found, as a fact that the Accused had indeed accepted Dai Jun’s offer and obtained gratification of $1,500 from him. In this connection, it was pertinent to note that the Accused agreed in Court that he understood that the money was offered by Dai Jun to induce him not to create problem for Glory at the Project site. [\[note: 125\]](#Ftn_125) As such, I found as a fact that the Accused had accepted the $1,500 for the said purpose.

### Mens Rea

#### The transactions were objectively corrupt

124    Turning to the _mens rea_ elements in relation to the charges, based on my findings of fact that the Accused had received:

> (a)     $3,000 from Dai Jun as inducement for not causing delay in piling works carried out at the Project construction site; and

> (b)     $1,500 from Dai Jun as inducement for not creating problems for Glory in its works carried out at the Project construction site,

> it was clear that the Accused had accepted the two sums as _quid pro quo_ for forbearing to inflict harm on the contractors at the worksite. This would, in turn, clothe the transactions with an objective corrupt element. The corrupt nature of the transactions was further reinforced by the surrounding circumstances of the payments. Firstly, the payments came from the contractors the Accused was duty-bound to supervise. Secondly, the payments were made surreptitiously, in a toilet cubicle and a room in the site office respectively. Thirdly, the Accused never disclosed the payments to CPG. Fourthly, the Accused was acting in clear breach of the terms of his employment with CPG, which, _inter alia_, prohibited the Accused from accepting any gift, favour or consideration as inducement or reward for forbearing to do anything in relation to any work in the Project.[\[note: 126\]](#Ftn_126)

#### The Accused acted with corrupt knowledge

125    As for the fourth element of guilty knowledge, based on my findings of fact that the Accused was aware of the purpose of Dai Jun’s payments, he must have known that the transactions were corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard. Indeed, Huang’s evidence that the Accused had expressly threatened the contractors with a 20 percent loss if his demands for payment were not met, reinforced the Accused’s unethical motivations behind the transactions.

126    I should add that arriving at my decision on the charges in this case, I did not find it necessary to rely on the evidence concerning the encounter between the Accused, Huang and Li Bin on 14 January 2020. Nonetheless, for completeness, I should state that I agreed with the prosecution’s analysis of the evidence in that regard, and their submission that the Accused was attempting to influence Li Bin and Huang’s evidence.

## Conclusion

127    In conclusion, having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found him guilty and convicted him of the same.

128    The Accused was sentenced as follows:

129    The sentences were ordered to run concurrently and the total net sentence was therefore 22 weeks’ imprisonment. Pursuant to section 13 of the PCA, I also imposed a penalty of $4,500, in default 2 weeks’ imprisonment. Execution of the sentence of imprisonment as well as the payment of the penalty had been stayed, pending the outcome of the Accused’s appeal.
