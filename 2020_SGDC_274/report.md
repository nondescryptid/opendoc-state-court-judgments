Criminal Law – Statutory offences – Misuse of Drugs Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9861/2020/01.\]

30 November 2020

### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

1       The Accused is a 37-year-old male. He claimed trial to the following two charges under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”):

> (a)     Unauthorised consumption of monoacetylmorphine; and

> (b)     Unauthorised consumption of methamphetamine.

Given that the Accused was previously convicted under s 8(b)(ii) MDA and punished under s 33A(1) MDA, he was liable upon conviction to enhanced punishment under the LT2 framework prescribed by s 33A(2) MDA.

2       After a nine-day trial, I found the Accused guilty of both charges and convicted him accordingly. I sentenced him to seven years and six months’ imprisonment, plus six strokes of the cane, for each charge. I ordered both sentences to run concurrently, giving a global sentence of seven years and six months’ imprisonment, plus twelve strokes of the cane.

3       The Accused, who is currently on bail, has appealed against both conviction and sentence.

## Facts

4       On 7 September 2017, the Accused was at a condominium unit at Jalan Eunos (“the Condominium Unit”) with two of his friends: Muhammad Khalid Bin Abdullah[^1] (“Khalid”) and Muhammad Razali Bin Ishak (“Razali”). At about 5pm, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) raided the Condominium Unit and found various drugs and drug-related paraphernalia on the floor. The raiding party included the following CNB officers:

> (a)     Station Inspector Mohamed Affendi Bin Ideris[^2] (“SI Affendi”);

> (b)     Station Inspector Feroz Bin Abd Rahman[^3] (“SI Feroz”); and

> (c)     Woman Staff Sergeant Nuriani Binte Mahat[^4] (“WSS Nuriani”).

The Accused, Khalid and Razali were placed under arrest.

5       After the raid at the Condominium Unit, the Accused, Khalid and Razali were escorted to vehicles at the ground floor and conveyed to Razali’s residence at Tampines. Upon arrival at a carpark at Tampines, a few of the CNB officers escorted Razali up to his flat to conduct a search, while the Accused and Khalid remained at the vehicles. Thereafter, all three men were transported to the Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”).

6       At PCC, the Accused was escorted by CNB Staff Sergeant Kovalan Gopala[^5] (“SSgt Kovalan”) to the bathroom, where the Accused’s urine samples were procured. One of these urine samples was used by SI Affendi to conduct an instant urine test (“IUT”). The remaining samples were sealed by SSgt Kovalan and sent to HSA for analysis.

7       While at PCC, the Accused was visited by his family members, including his wife Nur Anne Binte Mohd Hussin[^6] (“the Accused’s wife”), his sister Rashida Lestaluhu Binte Jaffar[^7] (“the Accused’s sister”) and his infant son. In the presence of the Accused’s wife, WSS Nuriani took the Accused through the list of belongings seized from him during the raid. Thereafter, WSS Nuriani prepared an itemised list of the Accused’s belongings, P10, which was signed by both the Accused and his wife.

8       SI Affendi also recorded a statement, P9, from the Accused (“the Long Statement”). This contained a confession by the Accused that he had:

> (a)     smoked heroin in the Condominium Unit just prior to the arrest, using the “chasing the dragon” method; and

> (b)     smoked Ice (the street name for methamphetamine) a “_few days back_” before the arrest.

The relevant extract of the Accused’s Long Statement is set out below:

> I wish to say that **_I did smoke heroin and ICE_**. This is the 2nd time I had been to \[the Condominium Unit\] … My sole purpose to go there is just to hang out with my 2 friends. However **_in the unit, I saw the drugs in front of me, I on my own took and smoke it_**. … **_The last occasion I smoke heroin was just before I was arrested in the unit. I smoke few puffs of heroin using ‘chasing the dragon’ method_**. I smoke in the living room of the condo unit. **_As for ‘ICE’, the last occasion I smoke was a few days back, also same in the unit_**. I smoke using an ‘Improvised pipe’. The heroin and ICE that I smoke I just took it from the floor of the living room. … The reason I relapse back to take drugs after I had completed my 16 months of urine supervision programme is just that the **_sudden trigger of urge when I saw the drugs_** laying on the condo unit living room floor. \[emphasis in italicized bold font added\].

9       While the Long Statement contained an admission by the Accused that he consumed drugs, it denied any notion of the drugs in the Condominium Unit being in his possession. In this respect, the Long Statement stated:

> Those drugs that recovered in the unit I do not know belongs to who. But they are not mine.

10     After the necessary procedures at PCC were completed, the Accused and Khalid were transported to Changi Prison for remand, where the Accused shared the same cell with Khalid.

11     About a week later, on 14 September 2017, the Accused was transported back to PCC again, where he gave two statements, D3 and D4 (“Cautioned Statements”), recorded by the investigation officer CNB Staff Sergeant Muhammad Rashidin Bin Mohamad Rafee[^8] (“IO Rashidin”). Unlike the Long Statement, which contained a confession by the Accused (that he had consumed drugs), both Cautioned Statements exculpated the Accused. Specifically, the Cautioned Statements put forth the defence that the Accused **unwittingly** drank a concoction containing heroin and Ice that _Khalid_ had prepared, while at the Condominium Unit.

> (a)     The relevant extract of D3, which answered the charge for consumption of monoacetylmorphine, reads as follows:

>> I did not take heroin since I was released from my LT-1 sentence. I was in a paranoia \[_sic_\] state at the point of time I was caught. I did not take heroin using the “chase-the-dragon” as mentioned. However, _I did consume a concoction which was prepared by “Khalid”._ I believed the concoction contained Heroin and Ice. I drank the concoction without “Khalid’s” knowledge. _It was only later on that “Khalid” told me that he had mix his Heroin & Ice in that concoction_ and that It \[_sic_\] was for his own use. I was actually not suppose to take his concoction but I accidentally did so. At that point of time, _I did not know that the concoction contained drug_ until I was told by “Khalid”. \[emphasis added\]

> (b)     The relevant extract of D4, which answered the charge for consumption of methamphetamine, reads as follows:

>> I did \[not\][^9] take any ‘Ice’ ever since I was released from LT-1 sentence. I did not consume ‘Ice’ using an improvised pipe as per my statement. I was in a paranoia \[_sic_\] state that time. As mentioned in my statement in the 1st Charge, _I only consumed the concoction drink_ that was found in the living room of the house that I was arrested in. That concoction drink was _prepared by “Khalid” for his own usage, which I do not know was mixed with ‘Heroin’ & ‘Ice’_. I drank the concoction drink because I was thirsty at that point of time. “Khalid” was not aware when I drank his concoction and _it was only later when he told me that I know that the concoction contained ‘Heroin’ and ‘Ice’_. Other than the concoction, I did not consumed any other drugs. As far as I know, _I did not knowingly consumed any Heroin or Ice_. … \[emphasis added\]

12     The Accused’s urine samples that were sent to HSA for analysis were subsequently certified to be positive for both monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine:

> (a)     HSA analyst Bellene Chung[^10] issued certificates P1 and P2, stating that the urine samples tested positive for monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine respectively.

> (b)     HSA analyst Evelyn Goh[^11] similarly issued certificates P3 & P4, stating that the urine samples tested positive for monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine respectively.

## The Prosecution’s case

13     During the Prosecution’s case, SI Affendi and SI Feroz were called to testify as to what happened during the raid at the Condominium Unit. The Prosecution adduced SI Feroz’s statement, P5, which set out the list[^12] of drug-related exhibits seized from the Condominium Unit. The Prosecution also called HSA analysts Bellene Chung and Evelyn Goh to testify about the tests they conducted on the Accused’s urine samples, which culminated in the HSA certificates P1 to P4.

14     The Prosecution argued that the positive HSA certificates triggered the presumption in s 22 MDA, which states:

> If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b) \[of the MDA\], he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).

15     Given that the s 22 MDA presumption is triggered only if the urine is procured and tested under s 31(4) MDA, the Prosecution called the following witnesses to establish that the procedures prescribed by s 31(4) MDA were complied with:

> (a)     SSgt Kovalan, who testified as to how he went about procuring the Accused’s urine samples; and

> (b)     CNB Station Inspector Ravichandran s/o Ramu,[^13] who testified as to how he despatched those urine samples to HSA for testing.

The Defence did not dispute that the s 31(4) MDA protocols were adhered to.

16     According to the Prosecution’s case, the operation of s 22 MDA meant that both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ for the offence under s 8(b) MDA were presumed, with the Defence bearing the burden of rebutting that presumption. The Prosecution’s case was that the Defence failed to do so. Central to this was the Accused’s confession in his Long Statement.

17     As for the exculpatory accounts in the Cautioned Statements, which advanced the defence that the Accused inadvertently consumed a drink that Khalid had laced with drugs, the Prosecution contended that this was fabricated by the Accused and Khalid, after they had shared a prison cell for a few days.

## The Defence

18     The factual evidence for the Defence came primarily from the Accused and Khalid.

19     According to the Accused, he went to the Condominium Unit on 7 September 2017 to visit Khalid and Razali. Upon arrival, the Accused saw Razali but Khalid was in the bathroom. The Accused spotted a cup of cold blackcurrant drink on the ground. Being thirsty, he drank the entire contents of the cup. Unbeknownst to the Accused, Khalid had earlier laced the drink with grounded Ice and one gram of heroin, intending for the drink to be for Khalid’s own consumption. When Khalid emerged from the bathroom, he asked what happened to his drink. When the Accused replied that he had consumed it, Khalid exclaimed that the drink contained drugs. The Accused was shocked.[^14] Nevertheless, the Accused remained in the Condominium Unit for about 30 to 40 minutes,[^15] whereupon the CNB officers arrived. When raiding the Condominium Unit, the CNB officers put the Accused, Khalid and Razali under arrest. In a nutshell, the Accused was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

20     While the CNB officers were searching the Condominium Unit, the Accused was interrogated by SI Affendi and SI Feroz.[^16] As the interrogation wore on, the Accused started to experience the onset of the effect of the drugs that he just consumed.

21     When the CNB officers were done with the Condominium Unit, they escorted the Accused, Khalid and Razali to the vehicles at the ground floor. The party boarded the vehicles and drove to Razali’s residence at Tampines, with the Accused occupying the same vehicle as Khalid and WSS Nuriani. In the vehicle, Khalid had apologised to the Accused −the CNB officers in the vehicle heard the apology.[^17] The Accused also had the opportunity to converse with WSS Nuriani during the journey to Tampines.

22     When they arrived at the Tampines carpark, the Accused saw the CNB officers escorting Razali out of the vehicle.[^18] While still at the carpark, the Accused’s mind “tripped”.[^19] In other words, he blacked out[^20] and could not remember what happened after that.[^21] He could not remember the CNB officers bringing Razali back to the vehicle.[^22] The Accused could not remember being conveyed from the Tampines carpark to PCC. He also could not remember what transpired at PCC that evening,[^23] meaning that his memory failed to capture the following events:

> (a)     The procurement of his urine samples;

> (b)     The visit by his wife, sister and son; and

> (c)     The process by which WSS Nuriani took the Accused through his belongings, which concluded with him signing the itemised list of belongings in P10.

Critically, the Accused could not remember the process by which SI Affendi recorded the Long Statement from him and could not remember the contents of the Long Statement.[^24]

23     The next thing that the Accused recalled was waking up at the prison sick bay in the early morning hours (3am to 4am) of 9 September 2017.[^25] The Accused remembered that he was then released from the sick bay and into a prison cell which he shared with Khalid and some other inmates.

24     In the prison cell, Khalid was initially suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms. However, as these symptoms tapered over the course of a few days, Khalid managed to relate to the Accused what transpired when they were at PCC, on the evening of the arrest (when the Accused had blacked out). The Accused shared the cell with Khalid until 14 September 2017,[^26] when the Accused was transported to PCC to have his Cautioned Statements recorded.

25     To prove the Accused’s claim of inadvertent consumption, the Defence called Khalid, who was already serving an enhanced imprisonment term for drug possession.[^27] Khalid testified that before the raid at the Condominium Unit, he had indeed laced his drink with Ice and heroin[^28] and the Accused consumed that drink without being aware of its contents.[^29]

## Ancillary Hearing

26     Towards the end of the Prosecution’s case, the Prosecution sought to adduce the Long Statement through SI Affendi. The Defence challenged the admissibility of the Long Statement on the ground that the Accused was “high”[^30] on drugs when it was being recorded, to the point that his mind did not go with the statement.[^31] Specifically, the Defence contended that the Accused had blacked out at the Tampines carpark and could not remember the events that transpired thereafter, including the recording of the Long Statement.

27     On the authority of _Public Prosecutor v Dahalan Bin Ladaewa_ \[1995\] <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 124</span> (“_Dahalan_”), both parties agreed that it was appropriate to conduct an ancillary hearing, under s 270 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) to determine the admissibility of the Long Statement. In _Dahalan_, the High Court held (at \[74\]-\[77\]) that apart from the court’s power under s 258(3) CPC to exclude statements procured from accused persons by threat, inducement or promise, there was also a discretion at common law to exclude statements recorded while the accused person was experiencing the peak of the effect of drugs that he had just consumed −such a person would be in no state to be interviewed. The High Court in _Dahalan_ thus held a _voir dire_ to determine the admissibility of a statement recorded while the accused person was experiencing the peak of the effects of erimin.

28      _Dahalan_ was endorsed in _Muhammad bin Kadar & another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span>, where our Court of Appeal held (at \[53\]) that _Dahalan_ was an instance of the court exercising its common law discretion to exclude voluntary statements that were otherwise admissible, where the prejudicial effect of the evidence exceeded its probative value. See also _Public Prosecutor v Sulaiman bin Jumari_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 210</span> (at \[42\]-\[45\]).

29     Given the Defence’s assertion that the Accused was, as at the point of recording the Long Statement, experiencing a “high” from allegedly consuming a concoction of Ice and heroin (to the point that his mind did not go with his statement), I agreed with parties that it was appropriate to hold an ancillary hearing to determine if I should exercise my common law discretion to exclude the Long Statement.

30     During the ancillary hearing, the Prosecution called the following witnesses:

> (a)     Dr Guo Song,[^32] a senior consultant psychiatrist from IMH (“Dr Guo”).

> (b)     SI Affendi, who recorded the Long Statement.

> (c)     WSS Nuriani, who spoke to the Accused at two points:

>> (i)       during the drive from the Condominium Unit to Razali’s Tampines residence; and

>> (ii)       while she was going through the process of itemising the Accused’s belongings at PCC, in the presence of the Accused and his wife.

> (d)     IO Rashidin, who recorded the Cautioned Statements.

31     The Defence called the following witnesses for the ancillary hearing:

> (a)     The Accused.

> (b)     The Accused’s wife who visited him at PCC on the evening of his arrest.

> (c)     The Accused’s sister, who also visited him at PCC on the evening of his arrest.

> (d)     The prison doctor, Dr Cheok Liangzhi[^33] (“Dr Cheok”).

32     At the end of the ancillary hearing, I ruled that the Prosecution had successfully proven why the Long Statement should be admitted. I set out my reasons below.

### Ancillary hearing −Medical evidence on the Accused’s mental state

33     It is important to underscore that the Accused’s defence was not simply that his cognitive abilities were impaired. Rather, his evidence was that he _blacked out_ at the Tampines carpark, to the point that he had no recollection of everything that transpired at PCC later that evening −including the recording of the Long Statement.

34     Dr Guo testified that during a blackout, the subject behaves normally[^34] and, within the blackout period, is able to recall memories of the past.[^35] However, for the duration of the blackout, the subject’s memory _stops coding_ what is happening around him.[^36] Meaning that when the subject wakes from the blackout, he will have no memory of what happened during the blackout period, even though he may have functioned normally while in his blacked out state.[^37] Dr Guo thus described a blackout as _anterograde_ amnesia.[^38]

35     Up to this point, Dr Guo’s exposition of blackout symptoms cohered with the Accused’s claim that he had no recollection of what happened between the point when his mind tripped at the Tampines carpark and when he woke up in the early morning hours of 9 September 2017 at the prison sick bay. The unresolvable glitch in the Accused’s defence was that Dr Guo also testified, quite unequivocally, that while one can potentially get blackouts from consuming drugs such as benzodiazepines, **one does not get blackouts from consuming heroin and Ice**.[^39] Dr Guo added that that he had _never_, in all his years of experience, encountered blackouts resulting from heroin or Ice consumption[^40] and he was 100% confident that this was unlikely. [^41]

36     Dr Guo’s testimony in this respect was not controverted by any evidence adduced during the ancillary hearing. As such, the Accused’s claims about the mental impairment which he allegedly laboured under during the recording of the Long Statement was, according to the medical evidence, a non-starter.

### Ancillary hearing −Evidence of the CNB officers at PCC

37     The CNB officers who interacted with the Accused at PCC on the evening of his arrest also testified that there was nothing untoward in his behaviour.

38     SI Affendi testified that when he was recording the Long Statement, the Accused looked physically well[^42] and did not look like he was either drowsy[^43] or under the influence of drugs.[^44]

39     Similarly, WSS Nuriani testified as to the following:

> (a)     The Accused was able to succinctly articulate his requests to WSS Nuriani, telling her that he was going to serve a long prison term and thus wanted to see his son and return his belongings to his wife.[^45]

> (b)     While at PCC, WSS Nuriani went through the Accused’s belongings in the presence of the Accused and his wife, with a view to preparing the itemised list of belongings in P10. During this process, the Accused was coherent and alert.[^46] He could write his own NRIC number and even scribbled a correction on one of the numbers.[^47]

> (c)     The Accused’s son visited him at PCC on the evening of his arrest, during which the Accused carried his son, hugged him and looked sad.[^48]

40     The evidence of SI Affendi and WSS Nuriani was consistent with the account of SSgt Kovalan, who testified (prior to the ancillary hearing) about the urine sample procurement process. SSgt Kovalan said that when the Accused was furnishing his urine samples, he did not appear to be high on drugs.[^49] Rather, he was able to comply with SSgt Kovalan’s instructions, _eg_, selecting the red and blue-capped bottles and filling them with urine. SSgt Kovalan explained that he would have remembered if the Accused had been walking unsteadily or had slurred speech or could not urinate straight.[^50]

### Ancillary hearing −How the Long Statement came to capture so many of the Accused’s personal details

41     The Defence sought to portray the Accused as someone who, as a result of being mentally impaired by drugs that he had just consumed, was spouting nonsense during the recording of the Long Statement.[^51] Consistent with this portrayal, the Defence alleged that the Accused had given his family nonsensical information when they sought directions on how to come down to PCC to visit him,[^52] such that they lost their way before eventually arriving.

42     In assessing the credibility of this portrayal, one could not help but notice that the Long Statement contained many personal details that were within the Accused’s specific knowledge. How could he have coherently narrated these to SI Affendi, during the recording of the Long Statement, if he had indeed been as mentally impaired as the Defence made him out to be?

43     To begin with, the Long Statement contained the Accused’s NRIC number and his address.[^53] To counter the inference that the Accused was coherent enough to convey these details to SI Affendi, the Defence suggested that SI Affendi could have simply copied them from the Accused’s criminal records form (“CRO 60”).

44     The Long Statement also contained a sentence that the Accused had just finished his urine supervision regime “_about a month plus ago_”. The Defence similarly suggested that SI Affendi inserted this after having derived it from the CRO 60. SI Affendi, on his part, was firm in testifying that the information about the Accused’s urine supervision order came directly from the Accused and SI Affendi may at most have referred to the CRO 60 to merely countercheck the details furnished by the Accused.[^54]

45     Even if I gave the Accused the benefit of the doubt and accepted that the above details were derived by SI Affendi from the CRO 60 and copied into the Long Statement (without the Accused having relayed them), there was still an array of other personal details captured by the Long Statement which could not have been gleaned from the CRO 60. The Defence would have to explain why, despite being in a mentally impaired state and spouting nonsense, the Accused could accurately furnish the following details found in the Long Statement:

> (a)     The name of the Accused’s mother.

> (b)     The fact that the Accused was married and had one child.

> (c)     The fact that the highest educational qualification attained by the Accused was GCE ‘O’ Level.

> (d)     Details of the Accused’s occupation, including the fact that he:

>> (i)       worked at an oil rig on a contract and freelancing basis;

>> (ii)       worked at Keppel, Sembawang and other shipyards; and

>> (iii)       earned his salary based on projects assigned to him.

There was no suggestion by the Defence about these details being inaccurate. They were very specific pieces of information that could not have been within SI Affendi’s prior personal knowledge.

46     SI Affendi testified that he obtained all these details directly from the Accused[^55] −SI Affendi was not challenged on this while he was on the stand. Yet, when the Accused was cross-examined by the Prosecution, he suggested that SI Affendi may have inserted these details into the Long Statement on his own accord, using information which the CNB officers extracted from the Accused before he blacked out. Specifically, the Accused suggested that:

> (a)     SI Affendi could have obtained the information from the Accused while interrogating him at the Condominium Unit, when the Accused was still lucid;[^56] and

> (b)     SI Feroz discovered the Accused’s highest educational qualification while interrogating him at the Condominium Unit[^57] and obtained the Accused’s occupational details from the oil rigger licence card found in the Accused’s wallet.[^58]

47     As for the name of the Accused’s mother, the Accused suggested that SI Affendi could have extracted this from statements that the Accused had given the authorities in previous investigations against him.[^59]

48     These were serious insinuations. The Defence was suggesting that SI Affendi improperly populated the Long Statement with details that had not come from the Accused’s mouth during the statement-recording process. Yet, the Defence never put or suggested to SI Affendi that the Long Statement was augmented with details obtained during the raid at the Condominium Unit or from the Accused’s past investigation statements.[^60] Surely, for an aspersion as serious as this, SI Affendi ought to have been given an opportunity to respond. Similarly, the Defence never put or suggested to SI Feroz that he had given the Accused’s occupational details to SI Affendi, with the latter then inserting them into the Long Statement. The Accused had waited until long after both CNB officers stepped off the witness stand before casting these aspersions.

49     I thus rejected the Defence’s suggestion that SI Affendi might have (on his own accord) inserted the Accused’s personal details into the Long Statement. This was an afterthought, concocted only after SI Affendi and SI Feroz had concluded their testimonies. Rather, I preferred the evidence of SI Affendi that these details came from the Accused. SI Affendi’s evidence on this point was also reinforced by the Accused’s concession, offered under cross-examination, that he may have given the details to SI Affendi during the recording of the Long Statement after all.[^61]

50     I was mindful of Dr Guo’s evidence that even in a state of blackout, a person can still recall memories from the past (albeit he will not recall events transpiring during the blackout itself). The Accused’s ability to recall the above personal details during the recording of the Long Statement would thus, arguably, not rule out the prospect of him being in a state of blackout at the time. Be that as it may, the fact that the Accused was able to accurately recount so many personal details when furnishing his Long Statement did, on balance, cohere more with the CNB officers’ depiction of a lucid person who gave clear answers, and less with the Defence’s portrayal (at paragraph 41 above) of an incoherent person spouting nonsense.

### Ancillary hearing −Evidence of the Accused’s wife and sister

51     The Defence also called the Accused’s wife and sister to testify about his mental state at PCC, on the evening of his arrest.

52     To bolster the portrayal of the Accused as suffering from cognitive impairment while he was at PCC, the Defence had alleged (see paragraph 41 above) that he gave nonsensical information when his family sought directions on how to come to PCC. However, when the Accused’s wife was called to the stand, she testified that the Accused had merely been brief when giving directions on how to come to PCC.[^62] She said that his instructions were unclear as he was speaking softly.[^63] The Accused’s wife said nothing about there being anything nonsensical in his directions. As such, the Defence’s portrayal of the Accused was contradicted by the evidence of his wife.

53     As for the Accused’s sister, she tried to show that the Accused was cognitively impaired, by highlighting that he told her to send his regards to their father. This was despite their father having been deceased for 10 years.[^64] I had thus asked the Accused’s sister if the Accused’s wife overheard his request (_ie_, to give his regards to his deceased father). The Accused’s sister replied that his request _was_ heard by his wife and the latter was shocked by it.[^65] Now, this would surely have been an extraordinary occurrence that, having shocked the Accused’s wife, ought to have been raised in her testimony. After all, she had been called by the Defence to give evidence about the Accused’s mental state while he was at PCC. Yet, when the Accused’s wife took the stand (which was before the Accused’s sister took the stand), she made no mention whatsoever of the alleged request by the Accused to give his regards to his deceased father. Evidently, the testimony of the Accused’s sister did not gel with that of his wife.

54     Both the Accused’s wife and sister also tried to demonstrate that the Accused was not his usual self on the evening of his arrest, while at PCC. The Accused’s wife testified that the Accused would normally hug and play with his son.[^66] However, while at PCC, the Accused showed no interest in his son and even appeared hostile to him.[^67] The Accused’s sister similarly testified that the Accused did not carry his son but ignored him.[^68]

55     The evidence of both the Accused’s wife and sister on this material point ran counter to the evidence of WSS Nuriani, who testified that the Accused had hugged his son and looked sad: see paragraph 39(c) above. In fact, WSS Nuriani’s evidence on this point was consistent with the testimony of a _key defence witness_, Khaled. Khaled took the stand only after the ancillary hearing and after the defence had been called. Nevertheless, it is apposite to highlight his evidence at this juncture, given how it corroborated WSS Nuriani’s account and controverted that of the Accused’s wife and sister. Khalid testified that while at PCC on the evening of the arrest, the Accused had:

> (a)     looked sad[^69] and mentioned that he was thinking of his son;[^70] and

> (b)     held his son when the latter arrived at PCC.[^71]

Khalid’s testimony thus presented a much closer match to the evidence of WSS Nuriani, while materially contradicting the claims of the Accused’s wife and sister about the cold treatment that the Accused allegedly gave his son.

56     In light of how the accounts of the Accused’s wife and sister had been undermined by the extraneous evidence, I rejected their testimonies that the Accused was not his usual self while at PCC, on the evening of his arrest.

### Ancillary hearing −Conclusion

57     At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I ruled that the Long Statement should be admitted in its entirety.

58     There was no credible evidence that the Accused’s mental state at the material time had impacted the Long Statement’s reliability, such that its admission would have been prejudicial. This was not a case where the statement-maker’s mind failed to go with his statement. The evidence was far more consistent with the Accused being lucid and coherent, when the Long Statement was recorded, than with the Defence’s portrayal of the Accused being in a state of blackout and spouting nonsense.

## Proceedings at the Main Trial

59     After the ancillary hearing, the Prosecution called IO Rashidin to the stand to give evidence on some formalities, before closing its case.

60     When the Defence declined to make a submission of no case to answer, I called upon the Accused to enter his defence, to which he elected to give evidence from the witness stand. In doing so, his testimony did not re-traverse those areas on which he had already testified upon at the ancillary hearing. In this respect, both parties agreed that by virtue of s 279(5) CPC, the evidence adduced at the ancillary hearing could be used for the main trial, to the extent that it was relevant.[^72]

61     Apart from the Accused, the Defence called two other witnesses at the main trial:

> (a)     Khalid, who testified about the events on the day of the arrest, including:

>> (i)       what happened at the Condominium Unit before and after the raid; and

>> (ii)       what transpired at PCC on the evening of the arrest,

>> as well as what happened after he and the Accused were remanded in the prison cell.

> (b)     Dr Terence Leong Sun Chee[^73] (“Dr Leong”), from Winslow Clinic, who testified about the Accused’s mental state and its impact on the reliability of the Long Statement.

62     As regards Dr Leong, the Defence had initially intended to call him for the ancillary hearing and had even paid for his expert report. However, Dr Leong eventually did **not** testify at the ancillary hearing as the Defence ultimately decided not to call him.[^74] Given the Accused’s financial situation, he could not (despite having already paid for Dr Leong’s expert report) afford the further fees that Dr Leong would charge for court attendance.[^75]

63     Subsequent to the ancillary hearing, _after I had ruled that I would admit the Long Statement_, the Defence said that it now wanted to call Dr Leong to testify at the main trial. Apparently, the Accused had re-evaluated his finances and was now willing to source for the funds to pay for Dr Leong’s court attendance.[^76] However, the Defence assured the court that Dr Leong would only testify as to the weight of the Long Statement and not its admissibility, given that the latter issue had already been determined at the ancillary hearing.[^77]

64     I set out below the issues that were canvassed at the main trial, as well as my conclusions on each of them.

### The Long Statement

65     The key obstacle that the Defence had to overcome was the Long Statement. This was a clear and unqualified admission of liability by the Accused, to both charges.

66     The Defence had failed in its attempt to exclude the Long Statement at the ancillary hearing. Nevertheless, the Defence persisted at the main trial in adducing evidence on the Accused’s mental state when he gave the Long Statement, to discredit the Long Statement’s reliability and discount its weight.

67     I examined each line attack by the Defence in this respect and found them all to be untenable.

#### Weight of the Long Statement −Evidence on the Accused’s mental state

##### (1)   The medical evidence

68     The Defence’s principal objection to attributing any weight to the Long Statement was that the Accused was under the influence of drugs when it was recorded. In support of this objection, the Defence relied on the expert testimony of Dr Leong. In his report, which was admitted as exhibit D7, Dr Leong opined as follows:

> (a)     If the Accused could follow instructions when his Long Statement was recorded on 7 September 2017, he might not have been in a state of delirium. However, he could still have been in a state of drowsiness or confusion, to the point of being vulnerable or prone to suggestions, such that his mind may not have gone with the statement. As such, Dr Leong had grave concerns over the voluntariness and accuracy of any statement made on 7 September 2017.[^78]

> (b)     Dr Leong urged caution when considering whether it was safe to admit the Long Statement, particularly given the Accused’s clear and consistent accounts ever since he gave the Cautioned Statements, as well as the corroboration from the Accused’s wife and sister that he remained drug-free since his release from prison in 2016.[^79]

69     In court, Dr Leong expanded upon these opinions, testifying as follows:

> (a)     The CNB officers (being lay persons) would not be able to recognise if the Accused had been in a state of delirium.[^80]

> (b)     Even if the Accused was not in a state of delirium and could follow instructions, his drowsiness might still have impaired his judgment.[^81] As such, even though the Accused may have been able to follow instructions (_eg_, when WSS Nuriani went through the process of itemising his belongings), he could still be prone to suggestions.[^82]

70     In my view, Dr Leong’s testimony did not assist the Accused’s case. Even if I accept that SI Affendi, WSS Nuriani and SI Kovalan were incapable (despite their years spent in drug enforcement) of telling if the Accused was indeed mentally impaired from the effect of drugs, it must be stressed that the Accused’s defence was _not_ simply that he was drowsy or susceptible to suggestions. Rather, his defence was that his mind tripped after the Tampines carpark and he _blacked out_ thereafter (see paragraph 22 above). He claimed to have displayed symptoms which Dr Guo described as “anterograde amnesia” (see paragraph 34 above) −a term which Dr Leong also employed.[^83] Specifically, the Accused could not remember what happened after leaving the Tampines carpark. He had no recollection of what happened at PCC, when his family visited him, when WSS Nuriani was itemising his belongings and (most crucially) when SI Affendi was recording the Long Statement. The next thing he remembered was waking up in the prison sick bay more than a day later, in the early morning hours of 9 September 2017.

71     The Accused’s claim to having blacked out was irreconcilable with the medical evidence. As stated above, during the ancillary hearing, Dr Guo asserted that he was 100% confident that a person is unlikely to black out from consuming heroin or Ice (see paragraph 34 above). At the main trial, Dr Guo’s evidence was _reinforced_ by the Defence’s own expert, Dr Leong, who similarly testified that heroin and methamphetamine are unlikely to cause blackouts.[^84]

##### (2)   Khalid’s testimony

72     The Accused’s defence of blackout was also undermined by the fact that he was able to recount events that happened at PCC on the evening of his arrest. Specifically, the Accused could:

> (a)     recount to the court that WSS Nuriani handed him over to SI Affendi, upon their arrival at PCC;[^85] and

> (b)     instruct his defence counsel, Mr Niroze, that SI Affendi went into the toilet where the Accused’s urine samples were being procured.[^86]

How could the Accused recall what these CNB officers did at PCC if he was supposed to have been in a state of blackout and thus incapable of remembering what happened at that time?

73     When the Accused was confronted with this conundrum, he explained that _Khalid told him_ about what had transpired at PCC. Khalid related these events to him while they were together in the prison cell, sometime between 9 September 2017 (when the Accused was released from the prison sick bay) and 14 September 2017 (when the Accused was transported to PCC for a second time, to record the Cautioned Statements). Specifically, Khalid told him that:

> (a)     WSS Nuriani handed the Accused over to SI Affendi upon their arrival at PCC;[^87] and

> (b)     SI Affendi went to the toilet while the Accused was giving his urine samples.[^88]

The Accused further explained that while Khalid did not know the names of both CNB officers, Khalid could still identify them because WSS Nuriani was the only female officer[^89] while SI Affendi spoke with a stammer.[^90]

74     However, the Accused’s explanation unravelled dramatically when Khalid testified in court. Khalid testified that he:

> (a)     did not pay attention to the CNB officers who were escorting the Accused out of the vehicle and into PCC;[^91]

> (b)     neither saw a female officer handing the Accused over to anyone at PCC[^92] nor told the Accused anything about a female officer handing the Accused over to a male officer;[^93]

> (c)     did not pay attention to the identity of the persons escorting the Accused within PCC;[^94] and

> (d)     did not pay attention to any significant traits of the CNB officers.[^95]

After getting these disavowals on record, the Prosecution revealed to Khalid that the Accused had testified that Khalid told him about what the CNB officers did at PCC. _Even then_, Khalid stated quite flatly that he “was not the one who told \[the Accused\] anything about what happened in \[PCC\]”.[^96]

75     During re-examination by the Defence, Khalid maintained that he did not think that he said anything to the Accused about what the CNB officers did at PCC.[^97] Mr Niroze had then followed up with a series of highly leading questions, suggesting to Khalid that he could have been suffering from the _peak_ of withdrawal symptoms while sharing the cell with the Accused[^98] (where Khalid allegedly recounted to the Accused what the CNB officers did at PCC). Mr Niroze had then asked Khalid about his powers to recall conversations that he engaged in while experiencing the pain and agony of such symptoms,[^99] to which Khalid replied that he would have a tendency to forget. From there, Mr Niroze circled back to ask Khalid whether, given his tendency to forget what was said during the pain of withdrawal, he still stood by the answer he gave under cross- examination, _ie_, that he did not say anything to the Accused about what the CNB officers did at PCC.[^100] It was only then that Khalid recanted and said: “_I could have said it … I could not have said it_.”[^101] I note that even at this late juncture, after the Prosecution had already shown its cards and revealed the Accused’s testimony, Khalid still refused to affirmatively testify that he _did_ tell the Accused what the CNB officers did at PCC.

76     Given the nature of Khalid’s testimony as described above, it was clear that he did _not_ tell the Accused about what the CNB officers did at PCC on the evening of the arrest. This then brought us back to the same question posed earlier: How could the Accused recount what the CNB officers did at PCC, if he was supposed to have been in a state of blackout and incapable of remembering what happened at that time? The irresistible inference was that he was _not_ in state of blackout while at PCC. He was lucid when WSS Nuriani handed him to SI Affendi. He was lucid when his urine samples were procured. That was how he could recount these events. Correspondingly, he must also have been lucid when the Long Statement was recorded.

77     The aspect of Khalid’s evidence which did the greatest damage to the defence was his account of what happened, sometime after 9 September 2017, when he was released from the prison sick bay and into the same cell as the Accused. Khalid testified that he and the Accused spoke about what happened at PCC on the evening of the arrest.[^102] Critically, Khalid testified that they _discussed what they said in their statements_, during which the **Accused even recounted what he said in his statement**.[^103] This was, in my view, fatal to the Accused’s claim[^104] that he had blacked out while at PCC and could not remember anything in the Long Statement.

78     It must be stressed that Khalid was a witness whom the Accused had seen fit to call, to buttress the defence of inadvertent consumption. In that respect, Khalid did not disappoint −he wholeheartedly endorsed the account that the Accused unwittingly consumed a drug-laced drink that was meant for Khalid. Yet, the fact that Khalid’s testimony was at odds with so many material aspects of the Accused’s case left me with no doubt that the Accused’s claim (of having blacked out) was a lie. I accepted the Prosecution’s suggestion[^105] that the Accused had conspired with Khalid for the latter to testify in support of his defence of inadvertent consumption. In fabricating their joint façade, they evidently failed to synchronise their accounts in respect of the most critical minutiae, resulting in a flimsy house of cards that tumbled under cross-examination.

##### (3)   Conclusion on whether the Accused’s mental state undermined the weight of the Long Statement

79     Consequently, the Accused’s contention that the weight of the Long Statement should be discounted by virtue of his mental state on the evening of his arrest should be rejected.

#### Weight of the Long Statement −Dr Leong’s inferences from the HSA certificates

80     I now move on to examine Dr Leong’s oral testimony. He had sought to draw certain inferences from the HSA certificates to show why the Long Statement was unreliable.

##### (1)   The fact that methamphetamine could still be detected in the urine samples procured on 7 September 2017

81     Dr Leong argued that the **presence** of _methamphetamine_ in the Accused’s urine, as certified by the HSA certificates P2 and P4, undermined the credibility of the Long Statement (which incriminated the Accused), while at the same time boosted the credibility of the Accused’s defence (as encapsulated in the Cautioned Statements). Dr Leong reasoned as follows:

> (a)     Methamphetamine can be detected in the urine for only up to three days post-consumption, following which it is fully metabolised.[^106]

> (b)     The Accused’s Long Statement recounted that he had smoked Ice, _ie_, the street name for methamphetamine, “_a few days back_” from 7 September 2017 (see extract of Long Statement at paragraph 8(b) above). If that confession were true, metabolization over those “few days” would mean that by the time his urine samples were procured on 7 September 2017, methamphetamine should no longer be in his system (having been fully metabolised).

> (c)     As such, the fact that methamphetamine was still detected in the Accused’s urine meant that his confession in the Long Statement that he smoked methamphetamine “a few days back” could not be true.[^107]

Dr Leong thus testified quite categorically that:[^108]

> if the \[Long Statement\] is accurate, then the urine test would have been negative for methamphetamine.

82     However, closer scrutiny revealed that Dr Leong’s opinion was not based on psychiatric expertise but on his _linguistic assumption_ of what the term “a few days back” meant.[^109] That was something for which his expert opinion was, with respect, irrelevant. After probing by the court, Dr Leong clarified that his conclusion was based on the assumption that the term “a few days back” from 7 September meant **4 September or earlier**.[^110] No explanation was offered for why the phrase could not be construed to include, say, 5 September.

83     Even if I accepted Dr Leong’s linguistic assumption, his opinion still did not pass muster when we drilled into specifics. Abiding by Dr Leong’s assumption that “a few days back” from 7 September denoted a timeframe of 4 September or earlier, I asked him when the methamphetamine would have been completely metabolised if consumed on the very latest day of that timeframe, _ie_, on 4 September 2017 itself. He replied that methamphetamine consumed on 4 September 2017 would have been fully metabolised by 6 September 2017[^111]−_ie_, it should have disappeared from the Accused’s system by **the day before** the urine samples were procured. I pointed out to Dr Leong that this was only two days: 4th to 5th being the first day; 5th to 6th being the second.[^112] The duration would therefore not have reached the three-day mark required for full metabolization. _Despite me explicitly pointing this out_, Dr Leong persisted in saying that three days would have expired by 6 September 2017, explaining that 4th would the first day, 5th would be the second and 6th would be the third.[^113] To prevent obfuscation, I had to pin Dr Leong down to the exact time of the day, asking him what would happen if the methamphetamine consumed on 4 September 2017 had been ingested at, say, 4 pm. It was only then that Dr Leong agreed that the third day would terminate only at 4 pm on _7 September_ 2017.[^114] This put paid to Dr Leong’s claim that methamphetamine consumed on 4 September 2017 would have been fully metabolised by the day before the urine samples were procured.

84     I pause to note that the manner in which Dr Leong had flatly (and on more than one occasion[^115]) testified that methamphetamine consumed on 4 September 2017 would have been fully metabolised by 6 September 2017 made it difficult to avoid the impression that Dr Leong had been quite cavalier, if not reckless, in pushing forth exculpatory proposals, despite being under oath.

85     Part of the Accused’s urine samples procured on 7 September 2017 was used for an IUT, conducted by SI Affendi, while the remaining samples were transmitted to HSA for tests that eventually culminated in the HSA certificates P1 to P4. Given that the time stamp on the IUT slip (admitted as exhibit P6) was 8.26pm, this meant that the Accused’s urine samples must have been procured before that. Going by the three-day timeframe which Dr Leong said was required for complete metabolization, any methamphetamine consumed by the Accused _on 4 September 2017 after 8.26pm_ would still be detectable in the urine samples sent to HSA. This would be an obvious scenario where consumption of methamphetamine, having occurred on 4 September 2017, would still be considered by Dr Leong (as per his linguistic assumption at paragraph 82 above) as having taken place “a few days back”, but the test results could _still be positive_ for methamphetamine. It was thus surprising that Dr Leong could so definitively aver, twice,[^116] that if the Long Statement was accurate, the HSA certificate would have been negative for methamphetamine.

86     Under cross-examination, Dr Leong eventually had to concede that if the Accused had taken methamphetamine on the night of 4 September 2017, his urine samples (procured on the evening of 7 September 2017) could still test positive for methamphetamine.[^117] But at the point of making this concession, Dr Leong switched to the second plank of his opinion,[^118] to which I now turn.

##### (2)   The fact that the HSA certificates contained no mention of amphetamines being detected in the urine samples

87     The second plank of Dr Leong’s opinion was this: Even if the **presence** of _methamphetamine_ in the Accused’s urine samples was consistent with the Accused’s confession in the Long Statement, the **absence** of _amphetamines_ was not. The fact that the HSA certificates in P2 and P4 only reported the presence of methamphetamine and made no mention of amphetamines (this being the metabolite of methamphetamine) meant that when the Accused’s urine samples were procured on the evening of 7 September 2017, the methamphetamine in his system had yet to be metabolised into amphetamines.[^119]

88     If Dr Leong was correct on this point, it would suggest that the procurement of the urine samples on 7 September 2017 took place _very shortly_ after the Accused’s ingestion of methamphetamine −so shortly that there was no time for the Accused to start metabolising the methamphetamine. This rendered the Long Statement, which stated that the Accused last smoked Ice “a few days back” before 7 September 2017, unlikely to be true, as the metabolization of methamphetamine over “a few days” ought to have given rise to some amphetamines in the Accused’s system. Conversely, this also rendered the version of events as per the Accused’s defence, _ie_, that he inadvertently consumed a methamphetamine-laced drink on 7 September 2017 (this being the very day on which the urine samples were procured), more likely to be true. The latter version envisaged a much shorter timeframe between consumption and procurement of the urine samples and would consequently be more consistent with the Accused not having had the time to start metabolising the methamphetamine into amphetamines.

89     For a start, it is observed that Dr Leong’s expert report failed to make any mention of the hypothesis above, _ie_, that failure of the HSA certificates P2 and P4 to explicitly certify the presence of amphetamines in the Accused’s urine samples meant that he had insufficient time to start metabolising the methamphetamine before those samples were procured. This omission was glaring, given that the hypothesis was advanced by Dr Leong at trial as one of the central planks to discredit the veracity of the Long Statement. When I queried Dr Leong on the omission, he explained that this hypothesis was _clear in his mind_ but he did not realise that it might not have been clear to the reader and that, on hindsight, he ought to have alluded to it in his expert report.[^120] I found this explanation incredible. It was hard to conceive of how a person could, on reading Dr Leong’s expert report, possibly discern the hypothesis that linked the HSA certificates’ failure to explicitly mention amphetamines to the conclusion that the Long Statement was untrue.

90     More importantly, Dr Leong’s hypothesis carried a pivotal assumption: So long as amphetamines are detected in a urine sample, the HSA certificate **will** mention their presence. Consequently, if the HSA certificate states that methamphetamine was detected in a urine sample but fails to explicitly certify that amphetamines were _also_ detected, this must mean that amphetamines were _absent_ in the urine sample −if amphetamines were present, the HSA certificate would have explicitly said so. Was this assumption correct?

91     In advancing this assumption, Dr Leong posed the following rhetorical question: If amphetamines were in fact present in the urine sample, why would HSA not mention it?[^121] Dr Leong also bolstered his assumption by citing his experience of having seen “_numerous HSA reports_” which certified the presence of both methamphetamine and amphetamines.[^122] Now, if Dr Leong had seen such reports before, it behoved him to adduce some documentary evidence to establish their existence. This would allow the court to ascertain the purpose for which those HSA reports were prepared and confirm if they indeed supported Dr Leong’s theories. Yet, this was not done. Dr Leong’s expert report was prepared in July 2019, meaning that _more than a year_ before he turned up in court to testify, he had already digested all the relevant documents, including (_inter alia_) the HSA certificates in P1 to P4, the confession in the Long Statement and the exculpatory accounts in the Cautioned Statements, as well as formalised his conclusions based on those documents. As at that point, he ought to have appreciated the criticality of his assumption that HSA certificates will explicitly mention any amphetamines detected in urine samples. This assumption undergirded his hypothesis that the HSA certificate’s mention of methamphetamine without any accompanying mention of amphetamines meant that there was insufficient time for the Accused to metabolise the methamphetamine. By Dr Leong’s own testimony, this hypothesis was _clear in his mind_ (see paragraph 89 above). Yet, despite having more than a year after finalising his expert report, Dr Leong still turned up in court without any evidence to show that HSA certificates will explicitly mention amphetamines, if these are detected in urine samples that test positive for methamphetamine.

92     In any case, Dr Leong’s hypothesis was debunked by HSA analyst Bellene Chung, who was recalled by the Prosecution as a rebuttal witness to respond to Dr Leong’s assumption about what HSA certificates will or will not explicitly state. Bellene Chung averred that just because amphetamines were not explicitly mentioned in the HSA certificate, this did not mean that they were absent in the urine sample. Rather, if HSA issues a certificate stating that the urine sample tested positive for methamphetamine, this _must_ mean that amphetamines (even if not explicitly mentioned) were also detected.[^123] HSA will _not_ issue a certificate that is positive for methamphetamine unless amphetamines were also present.[^124] Bellene Chung explained as follows:[^125]

> … HSA’s stand is when we want to report a positive, we will make sure that we will see methamphetamine and some amphetamine because when methamphetamine or the street name, Ice, it go through the body system, it will excrete majority unchanged as methamphetamine and some will metabolise to amphetamine. That’s why we will keep a lookout for the amphetamine as well before we will report positive.

93     The Defence complained that Bellene Chung failed to produce any evidence of the HSA protocol that amphetamines need not be explicitly mentioned when they are detected in a urine sample that has tested positive for methamphetamine. I found the complaint to be without merit. Bellene Chung had worked at HSA for 16 years[^126] – one could reasonably expect her to be well familiar with HSA’s practices. In that respect, her evidence was unequivocal. On more than one occasion during her testimony, she stressed that she was _100% certain_ about HSA’s position: amphetamines _must_ also have been detected before HSA’s certificate states that the urine is positive for methamphetamine.[^127] In stark contrast, Dr Leong admitted under cross-examination that he was not intimately familiar with HSA’s internal protocols[^128] and that he did not even know whether there was a rule for amphetamines to be reported, if present.[^129]

94     One cannot overemphasize the need for experts to express their opinions responsibly. Shooting dubious propositions from the hip that exculpate the client, without any accompanying evidential or empirical support, does not abide by the duty that an expert owes to the court. I had my doubts whether Dr Leong fully appreciated this.

##### (3)   Dr Leong’s plea for justice, fairness and compassion

95     I already explained (at paragraph 82 above) how Dr Leong had canvassed an exculpatory proposition that was grounded on linguistics rather than on psychiatric expertise. However, this was not the only occasion where he had strayed beyond the boundaries of his expertise when pushing a point favourable to the Accused. Another instance which bears noting is found at paragraph 37 of Dr Leong’s expert report:

> If \[the Accused\] were to be convicted despite the above, a community based sentence with mandatory psychological care can be considered. Incarceration will impact his family adversely, both emotionally and financially. It will deprive a 2 year old boy of his father and plunge the family into financial turmoil since Mr Qadir is the sole breadwinner.

96     It was curious that Dr Leong saw fit to raise this admonition to the court. His terms of reference, as encapsulated in the expert report,[^130] only required him to opine on whether the Accused was suffering from a psychiatric condition on the day of arrest and, if so, whether that materially influenced the voluntariness and accuracy of his statement. The Defence agreed that this was indeed Dr Leong’s terms of reference[^131] but explained that his words in the extract above were “mere background”.[^132] However, why there was even a need for Dr Leong to provide such background to the court, particularly when it related to matters that had no bearing on the Accused’s psychiatric evaluation?

97     Upon being quizzed by the Prosecution about paragraph 37 of his expert report, Dr Leong conceded that his comments therein went beyond his area of expertise.[^133] He explained that he was merely raising “mitigating factors” for consideration.[^134] When pressed as to why this was relevant, Dr Leong said:[^135]

> … I think in the greater light of the Court, the judiciary system here to---to act with, uh, justice and fairness, uh, while maintaining compassion for the hu---human be--- human state in this situation. In that light, I think this sentence is---this paragraph is appropriate.

98     All of the points alluded to by Dr Leong −justice, fairness and compassion for the Accused −are salutary. However, they are also considerations that fall within the remit of the sentencing court. Psychiatric experts would do well to note the caution sounded by the High Court in _Ho Mei Xia Hannah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 211</span> (at \[50\]):

> experts are duty-bound to be neutral and independent, and to assist the court rather than to advocate for a cause in a partisan manner, regardless of how sincerely the expert may sympathise with the cause of his client.

##### (4)   Conclusion on Dr Leong’s inferences from the HSA certificates

99     Having examined Dr Leong’s testimony, I rejected the inferences which he sought to draw from the fact that the HSA certificates showed positive results for methamphetamine while failing to explicitly mention the presence of amphetamines. The test results certified in the HSA certificates did not in any way serve to diminish the weight of the Long Statement.

#### Weight of the Long Statement −Inferences from the list of exhibits seized from the Condominium Unit

100    As mentioned at paragraph 8(a) above, the Long Statement contained an admission by the Accused that he smoked heroin in the Condominium Unit using the “chasing the dragon” method, just before the arrest. From this, the Defence propounded the theory that if the Long Statement had in fact been reflective of the truth, there must have been paraphernalia in the Condominium Unit that could have been used to smoke heroin by that method.

101    The list of exhibits seized from the Condominium Unit was set out in SI Feroz’s statement, P5. Specifically, the list of exhibits in P5 included “**One rolled up paper and One stained spoon**”.[^136] There did not appear to be any dispute that the rolled-up paper which was seized could be used as a makeshift pipe to inhale the heroin fumes pursuant to the “chasing the dragon method”, after the heroin had been heated up.[^137] The dispute which arose related to _how_ the heroin would be heated up. In this respect, the Defence claimed that the heroin would have to be heated up in an aluminium foil. Since no such aluminium foil was itemised in the list of seized exhibits in P5, there was nothing in the Condominium Unit which could have been used to heat the heroin. The Accused could thus not have smoked heroin using the “chasing the dragon” method in the Condominium Unit. The Long Statement was consequently untrue, and its weight would have to be discounted accordingly.

102    Underpinning the Defence’s line of reasoning above was the proposition that heroin could _only_ be heated up over an aluminium foil and not over any other implement in the list of seized exhibits in P5. The Defence’s closing submissions stated that this proposition was supported by SI Feroz himself:137

> \[SI Feroz\] agreed that the rolled up paper _can only be used_ after heroin is heated in an aluminium foil. \[emphasis added\]

103    However, this was a mischaracterisation of SI Feroz’s testimony. The relevant exchange during SI Feroz’s cross-examination is set out below:[^138]

> Q    … There was no aluminium foil that was found at this unit, which could have been used for the purpose of smoking heroin using the chasing the dragon method?

> A    … in this report there is no, uh, aluminium foils, so we’d be---did not seize it or did not recover it. However, there is a---one rolled up paper, uh, item B, which could be used to smoke the---the by the chasing the dragon method.

> Q    Yes. _The rolled up paper can be used only after the heroin is heat up in an aluminium foil, isn’t_ it?

> A     _I suppose so_ Your Honour.

> \[emphasis added\]

104    SI Feroz’s response was very different from what the Defence was suggesting, which was that heroin smoked using the “chasing the dragon” method can _only_ be heated over aluminium foil and not over any of the other implements seized from the Condominium Unit. If the Defence wanted to get such a sweeping concession from SI Feroz, this should have been put squarely to him. In that respect, I note that according to the list of seized exhibits in P5, the rolled-up paper (which could be used as a pipe for inhaling the heroin fumes) was listed together with a _stained spoon_. If the Defence wanted to advance the proposition that there was nothing in the entire list of seized exhibits in P5 that could have been used to heat up the heroin, it was incumbent on the Defence to specifically direct SI Feroz’s attention to the stained spoon and confirm that it could not be used for that purpose. This, it failed to do.

105    In his Long Statement, the Accused had also stated that he smoked Ice a few days back while in the Condominium Unit using an “improvised pipe” (see extract of Long Statement at paragraph 8(b) above). In a bid to cast further doubt on the veracity of the Long Statement, the Defence’s closing submissions stated that “**\[i\]t is also telling that no improvised pipe was found**” in the Condominium Unit.137 Presumably, the absence of any improvised pipe in the Condominium Unit would support the inference that the Accused could _not_ have smoked methamphetamine in the Condominium Unit and the Long Statement must consequently have been untrue.

106    This argument was misleading. Mr Niroze’s submissions completely omitted to draw the court’s attention to the critical fact that the list of exhibits in P5 explicitly mentioned “_\[t\]hree improvised glass instruments \[believed to be\] used in conjunction with smoking ice_”.[^139] When the Prosecution pointed this out during oral arguments, Mr Niroze countered that what were seized were “improvised _glass instruments_” believed to be used for smoking Ice. These may still not have been the “improvised _pipe_” referred to in the Long Statement, which the Accused said he had used to smoke Ice. In other words, a “glass instrument” is not a “pipe”. To show how fine the distinction was, Mr Niroze went on to explain that even a bong should not be considered a “pipe”.[^140]

107    This descent into what I felt was a fruitless exercise in semantics was no more than an attempt to grasp at straws. The fact that improvised glass instruments believed to be used for smoking Ice were seized clearly meant that the Defence had no basis to suggest that implements for smoking Ice were absent from the Condominium Unit (whether we termed them as “pipes” or not).

108    I thus found that the list of seized exhibits in P5 did not detract from the Long Statement in any way and consequently did not affect its weight.

#### Weight of the Long Statement −Discrepancy in timing

109    Another argument raised by the Defence to impugn the weight of the Long Statement pertained to the time at which it was recorded.

110    As reflected in the Long Statement, SI Affendi commenced the recording process at 10.10pm. However, the process by which WSS Nuriani sat the Accused down to run through his list of belongings commenced 10.15pm (as reflected in the itemised list of belongings P10) and, according to WSS Nuriani, concluded only at about 10.35pm or slightly before.[^141] As such, if the Accused was supposed to have been sitting down with WSS Nuriani from 10.15pm to just before 10.35pm, running through his list of belongings, how could SI Affendi commence recording the Long Statement from the Accused at 10.10pm? It was not as if the Accused could be in two places at one time, during the 20-minute interval between 10.15pm and 10.35pm.

111    The Defence seized upon the discrepancy in timing, saying that this was a grave error that was fatal to the Long Statement.[^142] During oral submissions, I asked the Defence to assist the court by unpacking this argument, _ie_, map out the steps by which the Defence travelled from the point of origin (the discrepant timing) to the destination (the Long Statement being fatally flawed).[^143] The Defence explained that it connected the dots as follows:

> (a)     If the Accused had indeed been with WSS Nuriani, he could not possibly have been with SI Affendi at the initial stages of the timeframe over which the Long Statement was stipulated to have been recorded.[^144]

> (b)     This in turn lent credence to the Defence theory, raised during the ancillary hearing, that SI Affendi had inserted details into the Long Statement that did not come from the Accused’s mouth during the statement-recording process. These details must thus have come from other sources, such as what was gleaned during the interrogation of the Accused in the Condominium Unit.[^145]

112    I was not convinced by this chain of reasoning. The discrepancy in timing was never raised to SI Affendi in cross-examination, so he was not given a chance to explain whether, for example, this could simply have been due to his reliance on an inaccurate clock. More importantly, as I had observed at paragraph 48 above, it was never put to SI Affendi that he had populated the Long Statement with information derived from what transpired at the Condominium Unit. Even the Accused conceded that he may have provided all the relevant details himself, during the recording of the Long Statement.[^146]

113    I thus rejected the attempt by the Defence to discount the weight of the statement just because of the clash between the timing reflected in the Long Statement and that in the itemised list of belongings P10.

#### Weight of the Long Statement −Conclusion

114    Having considered the evidence, I was of the view that the slew of arguments raised by the Defence to undermine the weight of the Long Statement lacked credible substantiation.

115    The Long Statement, including the Accused’s confession therein that he had consumed both heroin and Ice, should consequently be accorded its full weight in the determination of the Accused’s guilt.

### Adverse inference from Accused’s failure to tell the CNB officers about his defence

116    The Long Statement was not the only piece of evidence that undermined the defence. Another factor which reinforced the inference of guilt was the Accused’s failure, from the point of arrest to when he allegedly blacked out, to alert any of the CNB officers that he had just ingested drugs inadvertently. As the Court of Appeal held in _Pang Siew Fum & another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 635</span> (at \[71\]):

> It is trite law that the court may draw adverse inferences from an accused person’s omission to mention his/her defence on arrest – including the fact that such silence arose from a realisation of guilt.

117    The Accused claimed that when the Condominium Unit was raided, both SI Affendi and SI Feroz had interrogated him. Given that he had just drunk a cocktail of drugs barely an hour before that, one would have expected him to immediately tell the CNB officers about this and clarify that consumption was accidental. However, instead of raising this critical exculpatory detail, the Accused spoke about other things: he spoke to SI Feroz about his job as an oil rigger;[^147] he also chatted with the CNB officers about how the Accused’s uncle was a well-known actor.[^148]

118    The Accused explained that he did not raise his defence while in the Condominium Unit as he was caught up with the commotion and drama of the raid.[^149] I found this explanation to be unsatisfactory. Having previously been sentenced _three times_ for unauthorised drug consumption, with the last sentence being an enhanced punishment under the LT1 framework (see paragraph 141 below), the Accused must have been keenly aware of the stiff penalties which he would face if caught yet again for unauthorised drug consumption. He must have known just how imperative it would have been to immediately tell the raiding officers about his defence, especially since Khalid was on site to help corroborate it. Yet, no mention of the alleged inadvertent consumption was made by the Accused (or by Khalid for that matter).

119    Even if I accept the Accused’s explanation that he was distracted by the commotion in the Condominium Unit, I note that he had yet another opportunity to raise his defence, before he allegedly blacked out. Specifically, when the CNB officers were done with the Condominium Unit, they escorted the Accused to the vehicle and transported him to Razali’s residence at Tampines. During the journey, the commotion from the raid would have died down. The Accused would have had every opportunity to alert WSS Nuriani, who was seated with him in the vehicle, that there were drugs in his system which were unwittingly ingested. In fact, the Accused claimed that Khalid was apologising to him while they were in the vehicle and this was even heard by the CNB officers in the vehicle.[^150] Again, the Accused failed to take the opportunity to raise his defence, despite Khalid (in his apologetic state) being present in the vehicle to offer corroboration.

120    This was not a case where the Accused was so dumbfounded that he remained silent throughout the journey from the Condominium Unit to Tampines. During the trip, he asked WSS Nuriani for assistance to pass his personal belongings to his wife. It is critical to note that it was _the Accused_ who took the initiative to broach the issue with WSS Nuriani (and not the other way around),[^151] so it was clearly something that weighed on his mind. I found it unbelievable that the Accused could have been more preoccupied with asking the CNB officers for assistance to pass his belongings to his wife than with raising crucial exculpatory facts to them, if his defence had indeed been true.

121    The very first time that the Accused said anything about accidentally consuming Khalid’s drug-laced drink was when the Accused gave his Cautioned Statement which, coincidentally, was just after the Accused had spent five days sharing a prison cell with Khalid. Under such circumstances, it was difficult to resist the inference which the Prosecution sought to draw,[^152]_ie_, that the defence was a sham which the Accused had hatched with Khalid while they were in the prison cell together.

122    Given the Accused’s repeated failure to raise his defence of inadvertent consumption, as well as the timing at which it was ultimately raised, I drew an adverse inference as regards the bona fides of the defence.

### Whether the Accused suffered withdrawal symptoms after arrest

123    As a necessary corollary to the claim of inadvertent consumption, the Defence maintained that the Accused had been drug-free for over five years, up to the very point where he unwittingly consumed Khalid’s drug-laced drink on 7 September 2017.[^153] In this respect, the Defence highlighted the following:

> (a)     In July 2012, the Accused was sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment for drug consumption. After remission of sentence for good behaviour, the imprisonment term formally ended in March 2016.

> (b)     Upon release, the Accused was subjected to weekly urine supervision tests for a period of about 16 months, up till August 2017.[^154]

During the contiguous span of time from the commencement of incarceration in July 2012 to the end of the urine supervision period in August 2017, the Accused would obviously not have had any opportunity to indulge in drug consumption.

124    This left only a short one-month window between the end of the urine supervision period in August 2017 and the arrest on 7 September 2017. The Defence claimed that the Accused remained drug-free even during this one-month window, meaning that the very first time he ingested any drugs in more than five years was when he inadvertently consumed Khalid’s drink.

125    The Prosecution argued that the claim of one-off accidental consumption was negated by the fact that the Accused was diagnosed as suffering from withdrawal symptoms after the arrest.[^155] Dr Cheok, who was called as a defence witness at the ancillary hearing, had issued a letter dated 11 September 2017 (_ie_, four days after the arrest), admitted as exhibit D5, stating that the Accused was suffering from _moderate drug withdrawal symptoms_. This was based on the results of tests administered on the Accused under the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (“COWS test”) while he was in remand after the arrest. The Prosecution pointed to the evidence of Dr Guo, who testified that a single instance of accidental consumption in five years would not have been enough to generate the drug dependence required to trigger the withdrawal symptoms experienced by the Accused after the arrest.[^156] For such drug dependence to arise, there had to be persistent drug use for at least _two weeks_.[^157] The withdrawal symptoms displayed by the Accused after arrest thus showed that his consumption on the day of arrest could _not_ have been one-off.

126    The Defence sought to undermine Dr Cheok’s report (that the Accused was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms after the arrest) by relying on the evidence of Dr Leong. Dr Leong testified that the results of COWS tests administered in prison should be taken with a pinch of salt because of, _inter alia_, the following factors:

> (a)     Prison doctors who join the medical service are simply sent off to prison, where they administer the COWS test without ever having had proper training on administering these tests.[^158] In contrast, when Dr Leong ran the psychiatric ward, his nurses would routinely be trained on how to administer the COWS test.[^159] Presumably, this would give some cause for pause before results arrived at by prison doctors administering the COWS test are taken at face value.[^160]

> (b)     Conditions in the prisons sick bay were highly uncomfortable. For example, it was very hot and prisoners were sometimes restrained by all four limbs, to the point that they were forced to wet themselves in bed.[^161] Under such stressful conditions, it was possible for the prisoner’s symptoms to falsely indicate higher readings on the COWS test.

127    Mr Niroze also submitted that the Prosecution’s own medical expert, Dr Guo, conceded that the Accused’s COWS test results were **not** consistent with drug withdrawal.[^162] To this end, his closing submissions cited the following exchange from Dr Guo’s cross-examination:[^163]

> Q:    Now, based---based on the history, you would agree that it’s impossible that is withdrawal?

> A:    Yah.

128    This was yet another misleading submission from the Defence. Looking at the Notes of Evidence, one sees that barely three pages prior to the above extract, Mr Niroze had posited his line of questioning on the **assumption** that the Accused was _drug-free for five years_, up to the day of arrest:[^164]

> Q:    So, now, focus on these facts. The person has been drug-free from 2012. 5 years later, on 7th September 2017, there’s an accidental ingestion of opioids. Now, coming back to page 2 of P6, day 1 would be the 8th of September 2017 and day 2 and 3 would be 9th and 10th September. Now, tell me, in this case, right, in this particular case, was being free from drugs for 5---almost 5 years---4 or 5 years, accidental ingestion of 7th of September, would there be withdrawal?

> A:    I remember that I ans---answered this question last time. It’s impossible.

It was only against that assumption (_ie_, the Accused being drug-free for five years, with one-off consumption occurring only on the day of arrest) that Dr Guo agreed that withdrawal symptoms would be impossible. Dr Guo did _not_ say that the Accused’s COWS score was inconsistent with drug withdrawal.

129    To recap, Dr Leong himself recognised that there was a window of about one month prior to the arrest when the Accused was no longer under drug supervision, during which the Accused could resume his drug consumption habit. While Dr Leong opined[^165] that this one-month window was too short for the Accused’s drug usage to reach a level where withdrawal symptoms would be triggered after the arrest, Dr Guo was of the contrary view −Dr Guo felt that just two weeks of persistent drug use was enough to build the drug dependence needed to trigger withdrawal symptoms.[^166] As such, it was never Dr Guo’s opinion that withdrawal symptoms were impossible under the facts of this case.

130    Be that as it may, I did not think that my decision would turn on this point. Even if I accept the Defence’s position that the Accused was not suffering from drug withdrawal after arrest, such that he could not have been a heavy drug user at the time, this did not exonerate him. Even if he had religiously steered clear of drugs but, in a moment of weakness, succumbed to temptation in just those few days leading up to the arrest, the offence would still be made out.

### Conclusion on Accused’s guilt

131    After having heard the evidence and taken on board the probative weight of the Long Statement, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused was guilty of both consumption charges.

132    The HSA certificates P1 to P4 certified that both monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine were found in the Accused’s urine The operation of s 22 MDA (extracted at paragraph 14 above) was triggered, meaning that both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ for the offence under s 8(b) MDA were presumed. The Defence agreed that the presumption in s 22 MDA applied in this case.[^167] The burden thus fell on the Accused to rebut that presumption, on a balance of probabilities: see _Cheng Siah Johnson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span> (at \[15\]).

133    I found that the evidence adduced by the Defence failed to discharge that burden. A key obstacle in the way of the Defence was the Accused’s clear and unqualified confession in the Long Statement. The allegations put forth by the Defence to exclude the Long Statement on grounds of admissibility, or discount its weight, either went against the grain of the medical evidence, were unsubstantiated, or riddled with inconsistences.

134    I also drew an adverse inference against the Accused for his failure to raise his defence of inadvertent consumption, despite having opportunities to do so, both during and after the raid at the Condominium Unit.

## Sentence

135    It is trite that a timeous plea of guilt saves precious judicial time and warrants some moderation in sentencing: _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1097</span> (at \[17\]). Where such a plea demonstrates remorse, this is a mitigating factor warranting a discount in sentence: _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ \[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 155 (at \[77\]). In the present case, the Accused had demonstrated an abject lack of any such remorse.

136    The Prosecution submitted that an appropriate sentence in this case should incorporate a spread of **six months** above the statutory minimum imprisonment term. I agreed. In _Public Prosecutor v Othman Bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 208</span>, the accused person claimed trial to a charge of unauthorised drug consumption under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA. He was found guilty and, upon conviction, was liable to enhanced punishment under the LT2 framework prescribed by s 33A(2) MDA. The District Court sentenced the accused person to seven years and six months’ imprisonment, with six strokes of the cane. In factoring a spread of six months above the minimum imprisonment term, the District Court observed (at \[26\]) that the accused person had failed to show the remorse that would have warranted a lower sentence. The accused person’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court (in MA 9207/2018).

137    In mitigation, the Defence cited the case _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Gaus Bin Abd Karim_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 239</span> (_Mohammad Gaus_). In that case, the accused person claimed trial to one charge of consumption of methamphetamine, in contravention of s 8(b)(ii) MDA. He was found guilty after a two-day trial and, upon conviction, was liable to enhanced punishment under the LT2 framework prescribed by s 33A(2) MDA. The prosecution submitted that the accused person, having claimed trial, was not entitled to the discount usually granted to an offender who pleads guilty at the earliest opportunity. Despite this, the District Court sentenced the accused person to the statutory minimum imprisonment term of seven years, with six strokes of the cane. The Defence cited[^168] the following passage from the judgement in _Mohammad Gaus_ (at \[29\]):

> This court disagreed with the prosecution. An offender who pleads guilty is granted a discount of the bench-mark sentence, not because of that fact _per se_, but because it implied that the offender is remorseful. This court \[_sic_\] perception of the accused, at the trial, was that he claimed trial _because he wanted to_ \[_sic_\] _the prosecution to disclose its case in detail to him. This court could not infer that the accused was not remorseful just from his decision to claim trial_ to the first charge. In any case, he immediately pleaded guilty to the \[stood down\] charge after he was convicted on the first charge. \[emphasis added\]

138    I had difficulty grasping how _Mohammad Gaus_, particularly the reasoning emphasized in the quote extracted immediately above, applied to the Accused in the present case (assuming that I even agreed with that reasoning). The Case for the Prosecution had already been disclosed to the Accused, pursuant to criminal case disclosure procedures.[^169] As such, what else was there about the Prosecution’s case which the Accused wanted disclosed to him at trial, that was not already revealed in the criminal case disclosure process? The Defence did not point to any facet of the Prosecution’s case that would have necessitated further elicitation at trial.

139    The Defence nevertheless submitted that _Mohammad Gaus_ served as an “analogy” demonstrating that an accused person could still get the minimum sentence if there were bona fide reasons for claiming trial.[^170] In this case, the Defence suggested that bona fide reasons existed as, “for whatever reason, \[the Accused\] seemed to have believed in his defence.”[^171] I did not accept this to be the case. As explained above, the evidence demonstrated that the defence of inadvertent consumption was a fabrication, hatched by both the Accused and Khalid while they were together in the prison cell following the arrest.

140    After having carefully evaluated what transpired over the nine days of trial (which excluded submissions) in this case, I was of the view that there was no remorse by the Accused to speak of, to justify imposing the minimum sentence. Rather, there were aggravating factors that merited imposing an uplift. The Accused had cast aspersions on SI Affendi, insinuating that he improperly populated the Long Statement with information gleaned from outside of the statement-taking process. Such unfounded allegations against law enforcement officers underscore an accused person’s lack of remorse and should be treated as an aggravating factor: _Public Prosecutor v Amir Hamzah Bin Mohammad_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 165</span> (at \[19\]).

141    For context, I set out the Accused’s history of drug antecedents:

> (a)     In January 2005, he was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for unauthorised consumption of N,α-dimethyl-3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenethylamine, in contravention of s 8(b)(i) MDA.

> (b)     In May 2007, he was sentenced to:

>> (i)       Three years’ imprisonment for unauthorised consumption of cannabinol derivatives, in contravention of s 8(b)(i) MDA;

>> (ii)       14 months’ imprisonment for unauthorised possession of cannabinol, in contravention of s 8(a) MDA; and

>> (iii)       six months’ imprisonment for failure to report for urine testing.

>> The imprisonment term for the drug consumption charge ran consecutively with that for the urine testing charge, giving a global sentence of three years and six months’ imprisonment.

> (c)     In September 2012, he was sentenced to five years and 6 months’ imprisonment, with three strokes of the cane, for unauthorised consumption of monoacetylmorphine, in contravention of s 8(b)(ii) MDA. The sentence was meted out pursuant to the enhanced punishment provision under the LT1 framework prescribed by s 33A(1) MDA. Two further charges under s 8(b)(ii) for unauthorised consumption of methamphetamine and cannabinol derivatives were taken into consideration.

142    Upon his release from the LT1 imprisonment term referred to immediately above, the Accused was placed under a urine supervision regime. It is noteworthy that, as observed by Dr Leong, there was only a span of _about one month_ from the end of that supervision period to the Accused’s arrest. Obviously, the preceding string of imprisonment terms had not sufficiently deterred him from the ills of drug consumption.

143    Having considered the facts of the case in their totality, I agreed with the Prosecution that a spread of six months should be factored in, over and above the statutory minimum imprisonment term, for both charges. I sentenced the Accused to seven years and six months’ imprisonment, plus the minimum of six strokes of the cane, for each charge. So as not to arrive at a crushing sentence, I ordered the imprisonment terms for both charges to run concurrently, giving rise to a global sentence of **seven years and six months’ imprisonment, plus twelve strokes of the cane**.
