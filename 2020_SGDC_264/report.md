Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Young offenders – Whether probation or reformative training is the most appropriate sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9851/2020/01.\]

17 November 2020

### Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, male, 17 years old, had pleaded guilty to the following four charges: one charge of theft under section 379 read with section 34 of the Penal Code; one charge of theft under section 380 read with section 34 of the Penal Code; one charge of doing a rash act under section 336(a) of the Penal Code; and one charge under section 85(1) read with section 85(5) of the Road Traffic Act. He also agreed to the following three charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of his sentence: one charge under section 426 of the Penal Code; one charge under section 380 of the Penal Code; and one charge under section 5A(1) of the Road Traffic Act.

2       I called for pre-sentence report for his suitability for probation but he was found not suitable for probation. Subsequently, I called for the pre-sentence report for reformative training (RT) and he was assessed to be suitable for RT.

3       However, in view of his relatively young age and the circumstances of this case I was not minded to place him on RT but instead decided to give him a chance to reform himself by placing him on a probation order with a term of hostel stay requirement notwithstanding that he was found to be unsuitable for probation by the Probation Officer.

4       Being dissatisfied with the sentence, the Prosecution had filed a notice of appeal against the sentence and a stay of the execution of the probation order was granted.

5       I now give the grounds for my decision.

## The Charge

6       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following four charges:

> MCN 903051/2020

> “that you, on 5 February 2017 at about 11.30 p.m., at the bicycle parking area at the void deck at Block 62A Strathmore Avenue, Singapore, together with Zeon Ong Wee and Cheong Mun Siong in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did commit theft of a bicycle valued at S$1,500 belonging to Ng Yew Choe Alvin, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 379 read with section 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)”;

## Antecedents

9       The accused is untraced prior to the commission of the offences.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

10     The Prosecution submitted that while rehabilitation was relevant given the Accused’s age, however, in view of the risk factors identified by the Probation Officer and his continued defiance of the law despite the numerous opportunities given to him, a closed environment with rehabilitative element such as RT for a period of six months as recommended in the RT Report would be appropriate.

11     The Accused was also found not suitable for probation as there was no family member who was able to provide the adequate degree of supervision. The Prosecution submitted that great weight should ordinarily be accorded to the Probation Officer’s recommendations: _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_A Karthik_”) at \[78\] and hence probation would not be viable for the Accused.

## Mitigation

12     The Accused asked to be given another chance and informed this Court that he has learnt his lesson during the one week when he was remanded for his RT Report.

13     He has also indicated his consent to stay in the Singapore Boys Hostel if required by the Probation Officer.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

14     The sentencing court would generally consider the sentencing of a young offender in a 2-stage approach: _A Karthik_ at \[64\], citing _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“_Boaz Koh_”) at \[28\]:

> a)     the first stage is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence; and

> b)     the second stage is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.

15     As a starting point, the dominant sentencing consideration for young offenders below the age of 21 is that of rehabilitation. On the facts, the nature of the offences committed by the Accused are not serious and bearing in mind the age of the Accused at the time of the offences, rehabilitation remains the primary sentencing consideration at the first stage of the inquiry.

16     At the second stage of the inquiry, the main issue in contention is whether probation or reformative training, would be the most appropriate sentence. It was held at \[67\] of _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> that, at this second stage of the approach: “the court must select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. Where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal, given that probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation: _Boaz Koh_ at \[35\]. In contrast, where there is a need for both deterrence and rehabilitation, reformative training may be the most suitable sentence, given that it offers the court a useful middle ground between sending the offender to prison and meeting the desire to rehabilitate a young offender: _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\]–\[39\].

17     In determining whether probation or reformative training would be the most appropriate sentence given the circumstances of this case, I found that both general and specific deterrence do not feature significantly as important considerations when sentencing the Accused.

18     In my view, the offences committed by the Accused would at most attract a short custodial term of imprisonment had he been sentenced as an adult. In my assessment, probation with the additional condition of a 12 month residency stay in the Singapore Boys Hostel or until his National Service enlistment would strike a good balance between rehabilitation and deterrence by providing him a structured environment to reform and to reintegrate back into the society without the blemish of a permanent criminal conviction record.

## Conclusion

19     Where the nature of the offences committed are not serious and the Accused is still relatively young and has never been placed on probation before, this court in exercise of its discretion, would be slow to deny the Accused the opportunity to rehabilitate.

20     He has indicated his remorse and his willingness to reform and is aware that should he ever breaches any of his conditions of probation during the duration of the next 24 months of his probation, there will still be ample opportunity for him to be placed under RT for the same offences. Accordingly, I decided to give him one last chance to redeem himself by placing him on 24 months split probation: 12 months intensive and 12 months supervised with the following conditions:

> a)     To remain indoors from 10:00pm to 6:00 am;

> b)     To perform 80 hours of community service;

> c)     To reside at Singapore Boy’s Hostel for 12 months or until National Service enlistment;

> d)     Electronic monitoring for 6 months upon discharge from hostel or until National Service enlistment, whichever is earlier;

> e)     Progress Accountability Court Review: 4 months; and

> f)     Bond in the sum of $5000 to ensure accused’s good behaviour during the period of probation to be executed by the Mother.
