Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases

28 March 2022

### Deputy Registrar Loh Hui-min:

## Introduction

1       On 24 April 2017, the Plaintiff, then aged 52 years old, met with an accident when the Defendant’s motorcar collided with the motorcycle she had been riding pillion on (“the Accident”).

2       The present suit was commenced on 3 December 2019. Interlocutory judgment in default of appearance was entered on a 100% basis against the Defendant on 4 February 2020 with damages to be assessed and costs and interest reserved to the registrar hearing the assessment.

3       The assessment of damages hearing took place on 5 January 2022. The Plaintiff was the only witness called to give evidence. Both counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Sarindar Singh (“Mr Singh”) and counsel for the Defendant, Mr Tan Seng Chew Richard (“Mr Tan”) had agreed to dispense with the attendance of the medical expert witnesses and admit the medical reports dated 12 September 2017[^1], 20 June 2018[^2] and 13 September 2019[^3]. As a result of their election, I did not have the benefit of the expert witnesses clarifying or elaborating on various aspects of these medical reports. This had a significant impact on the Plaintiff’s case, as will be elaborated upon below.

4       After careful consideration of the evidence and parties’ arguments, I awarded the Plaintiff a total of **$30,849.50** in damages. I ordered interest to run at 5.33% per annum from the date of the writ (3 December 2019) to the date of the judgment (11 March 2022) on the sum of $30,849.50.

## Plaintiff’s claim for pain and suffering

5       The Plaintiff claimed that she sustained the following injuries in the Accident:

> (a)     left 3rd to 7th displaced rib fractures with left lung upper lobe pulmonary contusion and tiny hydropneumothorax;

> (b)     left superior and inferior pubic ramus fractures;

> (c)     multiple deep dermal abrasions over the left shoulder, left arm, left knee and left leg;

> (d)     left elbow contusion;

> (e)     left back wound 7.5 x 8.5 cm;

> (f)     luxated #11 upper right central incisor and #21 upper left central incisor; and

> (g)     scars.

6       In submissions, the Plaintiff also alleged _for the first time_, that she was also afflicted with the following disabilities arising from the injuries she had sustained:[^4]

> (a)     unable and/or unfit for employment in any employment in any vocation requiring her to stand, walk or lift any load;

> (b)     difficulty in walking long distances and/or over uneven ground;

> (c)     difficulty in climbing stairs;

> (d)     difficulty in kneeling or squatting;

> (e)     limping gait and the disability is permanent;

> (f)     pain in the left lateral chest wall when abduct her arms to reach for objects; and

> (g)     residual pain in the left leg with numbness and the left side of the torso.

7       None of these alleged disabilities were mentioned by the Plaintiff in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief[^5] (“AEIC”) or in her oral testimony. As such, not only was Mr Tan deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine her on these claims, but they seemed to me to be afterthoughts. These alleged disabilities were also completely unsupported by the available medical evidence. They were not mentioned in any of the three medical reports tendered to court. On the contrary, it was stated in the 20 June 2018 medical report that:[^6]

> Patient was last seen in the outpatient specialist clinic on 24/1/2018. The wounds were all healed with shoulder range of motion reaching full capacity. She was able to breathe well with no pain.

Under cross-examination, the Plaintiff was unable to recall if she had returned to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital since her review on 24 January 2018[^7] but confirmed that at present, she was not seeing any doctors for any of her injuries.[^8]

8       In the circumstances, I found that the Plaintiff had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that she suffered from the alleged disabilities. Accordingly, I did not take them into account when assessing the damages to be awarded for pain and suffering.

## Decision on damages for pain and suffering

9       Before dealing with each of the alleged injuries, I set out my general approach in assessing the damages for pain and suffering.

10     The quantification of damages for non-pecuniary losses, as is the case for claims for pain and suffering, is inherently difficult because such losses do not lend themselves to straightforward mathematical calculation. The guiding principle is therefore that of “fair compensation”, which means that compensation ought to be reasonable and just and need not be “absolute” or “perfect” (see _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> at \[9\]).

11     In assessing the quantum of damages to be awarded for pain and suffering, I obtained guidance from the ranges of damages published in Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“the Guidelines”) as well as various precedent cases[^9]. However, whilst these give a sense of the range of possible awards for each type of injury, each case must ultimately turn on its own particular facts (see _Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 178</span> (“_Ronnie Tan_”) at \[11\]).

12     Moreover, where the precedent cases were _unreported_, I treated them with some caution. This is because no detailed reasons for the damages awarded would have been issued, and their facts when summarised in digest (_e.g._, in Carrie Chan _et al, Practitioner’s Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (Lexis Nexis, 3rd Ed, 2016) (“the Blue Book”)), could lack sufficient particularity for meaningful comparisons to be made with the present case.

13     Finally, bearing in mind that the cited precedent cases were decided, and the Guidelines rendered several years ago, the damages awarded have been adjusted upwards to take into account the effect of inflation: see _Ronnie Tan_ at \[18\].

### Left 3rd to 7th displaced rib fractures with left lung upper lobe pulmonary contusion and tiny hydropneumothorax

14     The Plaintiff submitted for an award of $20,000, citing _Lee Seow Chuan v Trans-Island Bus Services Pte Ltd & Anor_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 1442 of 2000)[^10] (“_Lee Seow Chuan_”), where the sum of $20,000 had been awarded for the fracture of six ribs on the left side with pneumothorax, and _Tan Kim Lee v Mohd Yusof bin Hussain & Anor_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 3084 of 2000)[^11] (“_Tan Kim Lee_”), where the sum of $15,000 had been awarded for the fracture of the right 5th to 9th ribs with right haemo-pneumothorax.[^12]

15     The Defendant submitted for an award of $8,000 based on the Guidelines as follows:[^13]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(c) Minor</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(i) Bruises and fractures of ribs causing serious pain and disability over a period of weeks but here are no lasting disabilities. Prognosis is good and full recovery is achieved in a few weeks.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">…</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$1,500 - $15,000</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Generally, $2,000 per rib although overlapping must be taken into consideration, adding $3,000-$4,000 for pneumothorax or haemothorax (where the rib bone pierces the lung or heart)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

16     According to the 20 June 2018 medical report, “open reduction and internal fixation of the left 3rd to 7th ribs fractures were performed” and the Plaintiff had “recovered uneventfully”.[^14] When she was seen on 24 January 2018, “she was able to breathe well with no pain”.[^15] I therefore found that the Plaintiff had recovered from these injuries with no residual disabilities by 24 January 2018 (about nine months from the date of the accident) _at the latest_. The Plaintiff’s injuries thus fell to be a minor chest injury within the aforesaid description in the Guidelines.

17     I was unable to accept the Plaintiff’s submission. An award of $20,000 would lie at the very highest end of Guideline range applicable to moderate chest and lung injuries which cause some continuing disability that will impact the injured person’s ability to work and is likely to be permanent. This factor of continued disability was not present here. The present case was also clearly distinguishable from _Zakaria bin Putra Ali v Low Keng Huat Construction Co (S) Pte Ltd & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] SGHC 277</span>, where $15,000 was awarded to a claimant whose six fractured ribs and pneumothorax when healed, left an obvious depression in his chest wall and continued to cause him pain when breathing.

18     In my view, the two cases cited by the Plaintiff ought to be treated with caution. The award in _Tan Kim Lee_ was agreed upon by parties and did not arise from an assessment by the court. As for _Lee Seow Chuan_, the award made there was **_substantially higher_** than awards in cases involving multiple rib fractures with associated lung injuries, but full recovery was achieved with no lasting disabilities. For example:

> (a)     $5,000 awarded for comminuted fractures of 2 ribs with pneumothorax: _Mullaichelvan s/o Perumal v Lee Heng Kah_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHCR 3</span>.

> (b)     $8,000 awarded for fracture of right 2nd to 5th ribs and left 5th to 7th ribs: _Teo Seng Kiat v Goh Hwa Teck_ (Unreported, HC Suit No. 2244 of 1998)[^16].

> (c)     $6,000 awarded for fracture of 4th to 7th ribs: _Lim Mei Cheng v Lim Siew Choo_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 4952 of 2001)[^17] (“_Lim Mei Cheng_”).

> (d)     $7,000 was awarded for fractures of the 4th to 6th ribs which caused a right haemothorax that required the immediate insertion of a chest tube to remove blood upon hospital admission (which was only removed 8 days later): _Ooi Han Sun and anor v Bee Hua Meng_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 922</span>.

19     Having regard to the nature of the injuries (including overlaps) as well as the Guideline range and case precedents, I assessed **$10,000** to be an appropriate award for the Plaintiff’s chest injuries.

### Left superior and inferior pubic ramus fractures

20     The Plaintiff submitted for an award of $30,000 citing _Bong Hwee Haw v Silviu Ionescu_ (Unreported, HC Suit No. 437 of 2010) [^18] (_Bong Hwee Haw_), where the sum of $25,000 had been awarded for fracture of pelvis (right superior and inferior pubic rami).

21     The Defendant submitted for an award of $5,500 based on the Guidelines as follows:[^19]

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="53.7%"> <col width="46.3%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(c) Cases where there is significant injury to the pelvis and/or hip but full recovery is achieved with little or no residual disability in the long run.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$5,500 - $8,000</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

22     According to the 20 June 2018 medical report, the fractures were managed conservatively.[^20] There was further mention in the said report that the Plaintiff was discharged to Jurong Community Hospital for “rehabilitation”.[^21] However, it is not clear what this rehabilitation was for, the frequency of or the duration of this rehabilitation. In any event, for the reasons previously stated (at \[7\] above), I found that the Plaintiff had recovered with no residual disabilities by 24 January 2018 _at the latest_. As such, the Plaintiff’s injury fell within the aforesaid description in the Guidelines.

23     By contrast, the Plaintiff’s submission for $30,000 was at the lower end of the range provided for _severe_ pelvis and hip injuries which lead to significant long-term disabilities affecting the gait of the person and considerable chronic pain. There was no evidence that the Plaintiff’s injuries were so grievous. In this regard, the present case was distinguishable from _Ng Ng Mui v Ibrahim Bin Mohamed_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] SGHC 196</span> (“_Ng Ng Mui_”) where $18,000 was awarded for fractures of the right superior and inferior pubic ramus which affected the right sacro-iliac region and resulted in the claimant suffering from permanent residual disabilities, including restriction of movement and obstetrical problems.

24     As for the Plaintiff’s reliance on _Bong Hwee Haw_, I noted that the Plaintiff’s submission for $30,000 was an uplift from the $25,000 awarded in that case. No explanation or justification was provided for this. In any event, I was inclined to treat this case with caution:

> (a)     The award in _Bong Hwee Haw_ was inclusive of the pain and suffering caused by scars. Unfortunately, information about the nature and extent of the scarring was absent from the case digest, as were other details like the treatment of these injuries and the duration of recovery.

> (b)     The award in _Bong Hwee Haw_ was also substantially higher than awards in other cases for fractures of the pubic ramus where there was no lasting residual disability, _e.g._, $7,000 in _Lim Mei Cheng_ and $7,500 in _Choong Peng Kong v Koh Hong Son_ (Unreported, HC Suit No. 142 of 2002)[^22].

> (c)     The award in _Bong Hwee Haw_ also far exceeded awards for similar fractures which had resulted in long term disabilities, _e.g._, _Ng Ng Mui_ (at \[23\] above) and _Saravana Kumaran a/l Thangaraj v Muhammed Azfar bin Mohammed Deah and Anor_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 282 of 2011)[^23] where $10,000 was awarded for a closed fracture of the right superior pubic rami and soft tissue injury of the right hip which resulted in permanent disabilities like pain (which may worsen with time) on loading of the right hip joint and on external rotation and probable mild/early post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the right sacroiliac joint.

25     In my assessment therefore, an award of **$8,000** was just and reasonable.

### Left elbow contusion, multiple deep dermal abrasions over the left shoulder, left arm, left knee and left leg and scars

26     Parties submitted for different approaches to be taken in assessing damages for these injuries. The Plaintiff submitted for separate awards for each injury type as follows:

> (a)     Left elbow contusion -- $1, 500, citing _Chin Yew Fah v Tan Hoe and others_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 252 of 2009)[^24] where $1,500 was awarded for a right elbow contusion.

> (b)     Multiple deep dermal abrasions -- $10,000, citing _Yong Jianlong v Veerappan s/o Veerappan Suparamaniam_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 1837 of 2012)[^25] (“_Yong Jianlong_”) where $13,000 was awarded for multiple abrasions.

> (c)     Scars -- $5,000, citing _Chang Ah Lek & Ors v Lim Ah Koon_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 551</span> where $5,000 was awarded for scarring.

The Defendant argued that there was a “clear overlap” between these injuries and submitted for a collective award of $3,000.[^26]

27     I agreed with the Defendant’s approach. The injuries overlapped to some extent in terms of location and (_i.e._, the left arm/elbow) and/or were related to the same function of the body. I therefore assessed damages for these injuries globally.

28     It was not disputed that the Plaintiff suffered multiple deep dermal as well as superficial abrasions. The sizes of these abrasions were not documented. Although there were discrepancies across the three medical reports in respect of the location of these abrasions, these were minor and did not impact my assessment given my intention to make a global award for all these injuries.

29     The 20 June 2018 medical report stated that the Plaintiff had declined excision and grafting in respect of the multiple dermal abrasions.[^27] The Defendant submitted that because of this, these multiple dermal abrasions could not have been as serious or painful as the Plaintiff alleged.[^28] I disagreed. First, the fact that excision and grafting was recommended strongly suggested that the dermal abrasions were at least serious enough to warrant surgical intervention (as contrasted to the superficial abrasions which were treated conservatively). Second, there was simply no evidence that the Plaintiff had declined treatment because the injuries were not painful or serious. Patients do decline treatments recommended by their doctors for various reasons unrelated to the injuries/medical conditions themselves. More importantly, this was a line of cross-examination that the Defendant could have pursued but did not. The Plaintiff was thus deprived of the opportunity to offer her explanation.

30     As for the alleged scars, none of the medical reports adduced mention scarring. The 20 June 2018 medical report merely mentioned that at the Plaintiff’s last visit to the outpatient specialist clinic on 24 January 2018, “the wounds were all healed”. [^29] There was thus no medical evidence before me as to the nature, location, and extent of the alleged scarring. The photos adduced by the Plaintiff also did not assist me insofar as they showed covered fresh wounds and not scars.[^30] The present case was therefore distinguishable from _Yong Jianlong_ where the award had been for multiple abrasions **_and scarring_**, the latter being extensive based on the list of scars published.

31     Having regard to the Guidelines for contusions ($500 for single and $500 – $1,500 for multiple) and abrasions ($500 for single and $500 – $3000 for multiple)[^31] and the totality of the injuries suffered by the Plaintiff, I awarded **$4,000**.

### Left back wound 7.5 x 8.5 cm

32     Parties disputed whether this injury arose from the Accident. The Plaintiff submitted that the Accident had aggravated a pre-existing back wound on the Plaintiff which resulted in the Plaintiff having to undergo surgical reconstruction of her back wound.[^32] The Defendant submitted that the Plaintiff had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the back wound had arisen from or was connected to the Accident.[^33]

33     It was unclear from the medical evidence adduced that the left back wound arose from or was connected to the Accident. I do not propose to repeat the contents of the 20 June 2018 medical report here, but to me what it _did not_ state was more significant. First, there was no mention of the condition of the pre-existing back wound (for which the Plaintiff had undergone saucerization and negative pressure wound therapy) _prior to the Accident_. Second, if there was indeed an aggravation of the pre-existing back wound by the Accident, the medical report was silent on the nature and extent of this.

34     At the assessment hearing, I had highlighted my concerns about the state of the medical evidence in relation to this alleged injury and asked parties if the medical witnesses would be needed, notwithstanding their earlier agreement to dispense with them.[^34] Parties confirmed their decision to dispense with the medical witnesses.[^35]

35     The Plaintiff’s evidence did not suffice the plug the gaps in the medical evidence. First, her evidence regarding this injury was unclear. She initially claimed that the pre-existing wound had been fully healed prior to the accident but subsequently stated that the skin graft which took place had been for the back injury before the accident.[^36] In any event, she is a layman, and her views were not an adequate substitute for the evidence of the medical experts who had treated her.

36     In the premises, I found that the Plaintiff failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the Accident had caused this injury or aggravated a pre-existing injury. I therefore made no award for this.

### Luxated #11 upper right central incisor and #21 upper left central incisor

37     The Plaintiff submitted for a sum of $6,000 to be awarded, citing the case of _Leong Mei Li Janice v Low Mun Seng_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 3408 of 1997)[^37] (“_Leong Mei Li Janice”_) where $4,000 was awarded for the loss of upper right central incisor #11 and a fractured upper right lateral incisor #12 which was eventually removed; and $3,000 was awarded for a loosened upper left central incisor #21 and tender teeth #13 and #22.

38     The Defendant submitted for an award of $1,600 based on the following ranges in the Guidelines:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range of awards</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Teeth</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) Fracture</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Loss of each tooth</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) Contusion and pulp necrosis</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$1,000-$2,000</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$1,500–$2,500</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$1,000-$3,000</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

39     Whilst I agreed with the Defendant that the luxation of a tooth was not a fracture or a loss of a tooth, the seriousness of the injury mut still be considered in light of the available medical evidence. As stated in the 13 September 2019 medical report, the upper right central incisor #11 was extracted as part of the Plaintiff’s treatment.[^38] As for upper left central incisor #21, a composite resin splint was necessitated and the Plaintiff was advised to seek root canal treatment in view of its increased mobility and devitalisation.[^39] I rejected the Defendant’s argument that the proper inference to draw from the Plaintiff’s refusal to undergo the root canal meant that she experienced less pain and suffering from her dental injuries[^40]. This was not put to the Plaintiff during cross-examination, and she was therefore deprived of an opportunity to offer her explanation.

40     It was clear from the 13 September 2019 medical report that the Plaintiff’s dental injuries had not been fully resolved as of 14 August 2017. However, as the Plaintiff did not return for her follow up appointments,[^41] had testified that she was not currently seeing any doctors for her injuries[^42] and had not mentioned any unresolved dental issues in her AEIC or evidence in court, I found that the dental injuries had been resolved at some point _after_ 14 August 2017 and before the assessment hearing.

41     Having regard to the Guideline ranges and the awards in _Leong Mei Li Janice_, I considered an award of **$3,000** for the Plaintiff’s dental injuries appropriate.

## Decision on special damages

42     The Plaintiff claimed for two heads of special damages, namely medical expenses and transport expenses. Both the Plaintiff and Defendant submitted for a sum of **$5,729.50** for medical expenses based on the invoices and receipts adduced by the Plaintiff.[^43] I accordingly awarded the same.

43     As for transport expenses, no receipts were provided of the actual transport costs incurred by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff submitted for $300[^44] but provided no explanation for how this figure had been arrived at. The Defendant submitted for $100 based on $20 for 5 round trips. [^45]

44     Based on the invoices, the Plaintiff made four trips for her dental injuries[^46]. Besides the Plaintiff’s initial admission into the hospital, she had attended at least one follow up for her injuries arising from the Accident on 24 January 2018[^47]. The invoices show that the Plaintiff had visited the hospital on several other occasions. Unfortunately, it was not entirely clear whether these were for the purpose of treating or following up on the Plaintiff’s injuries from the Accident or for the back wound (which I found did not arise from the Accident), or both. The Plaintiff also testified that she could not recall the mode of transport she took to visit the hospital.[^48]

45     In the circumstances, I awarded **$120** for transport expenses, which translates to $20 for six round trips.

## Conclusion
