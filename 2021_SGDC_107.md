Tort – Negligence

Tort – Breach of statutory duty

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 9/2021.

8 June 2021

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff’s claim arises from a collision between a boom lift and the plaintiff. The boom lift was operated by the first defendant’s employee. The accident occurred at the second defendant’s factory at Jurong Island. The plaintiff commenced the action herein against the first and second defendants, but subsequently discontinued his claim against the second defendant.

2       The trial proceeded only against the first defendant. At the end of the trial, I dismissed the plaintiff’s claim against the first defendant. The plaintiff has appealed against my decision.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff was employed as a construction worker by the first defendant, at the second defendant’s factory at Jurong Island. The plaintiff was deployed as a banksman for a boom lift operated by Karuppiah Karuppusamy, the boom lift operator (“the Operator”). The Operator was also employed by the first defendant.

4       It is not disputed that the plaintiff was to provide signals to the Operator in driving the boom lift. The plaintiff has pleaded that “The Plaintiff was instructed to provide signals to the Operator while the Operator maneuvered the boom lift”.[^1]

5       The first defendant has pleaded that the plaintiff acted as the banksman to signal and guide the Operator. The role of the banksman was described in the first defendant’s defence as follows:

>     Due to the design of the boom lift, the Operator driving it would not be able to see the road ahead, as his view would be blocked by the huge engine and boom lift. Hence the Plaintiff’s duty as Banksman was to signal and guide the Operator when the Operator was driving and operating the boom lift.[^2]

6       In essence, the plaintiff was effectively the eyes of the Operator, who relied on the plaintiff to see ahead, while the Operator was driving the boom lift.

7       On 20 December 2016 at about 9 am, the plaintiff was walking in front of the boom lift while it was being driven by the Operator, when he was struck from the rear by the boom lift. The plaintiff suffered injuries, which he claims were caused by the negligence or breach of statutory duty of the first defendant, its agents or servants.[^3]

8       In his statement of claim, the plaintiff claimed that the boom lift had stopped before a sharp turn. The plaintiff was to guide the boom lift in making the turn, but the boom lift suddenly turned left and collided into the plaintiff, without the plaintiff signalling the Operator to proceed.[^4] However, in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff alleged that he was walking along the middle of the road, when the boom lift suddenly increased speed, moved fast forward and collided into him.[^5]

9       The first defendant’s position is that instead of walking in front of the boom lift, the plaintiff should have walked along the side of the boom lift so that the Operator could see the plaintiff. The first defendant pleaded that:

>     … the Plaintiff negligently walked to the front of the boom lift, out of sight of the Operator. The Plaintiff’s duty was to be on the side of the boom lift at all times when the boom lift was being driven or in operation, so as to be within sight of the Operator. Due to the Plaintiff’s said negligence and failure to perform his duty properly by walking to the front of the boom lift, out of sight of the Operator, the boom lift collided into the Plaintiff.[^6]

10     The Operator’s evidence was that:

> (a)     He followed the plaintiff’s directions strictly and that “when the Plaintiff signalled for me to go forward, I would drive forward and when he signalled for me to stop, I would stop.”[^7]

> (b)     In the five days prior to the incident, the plaintiff and the Operator had followed the same route each day and the same route was taken on the day of the accident.[^8]

> (c)     Before the accident, he had continued driving as the plaintiff did not signal him to stop and that although “there were moments when the Plaintiff went out of my line of sight, but as long as he did not signal me to stop, I would continue driving the boom lift forward”.[^9]

11     The following two CCTV videos were produced showing the journey of the boom lift:

> (a)     The first video showed the plaintiff and the Operator setting off at the start of the journey of the boom lift. In this video, the plaintiff was guiding the boom lift, while walking along the right of the boom lift. At the end of the first video, the boom lift and the plaintiff could be seen making a right turn onto another road.

> (b)     The second video was after the boom lift had made the aforesaid right turn. However, in this second video, the plaintiff was no longer walking along the right side of the boom lift. Instead, this second video showed the plaintiff walking in front of the boom lift, before he was hit from the rear by the boom lift. Both the plaintiff and the boom lift were travelling straight along the road when the accident occurred. Although the plaintiff and the boom lift were approaching a left turn, the left turn was still some distance away, when the accident occurred. There was nothing in the video to suggest that the boom lift was turning left when the collision occurred, contrary to the plaintiff’s allegation in his statement of claim that the collision occurred when the boom lift suddenly turned left.

12     Neither video captures when the plaintiff moved from the right of the boom lift, to the front of the boom lift.

## Issues

13     The key issues arising from the pleadings and the evidence are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the plaintiff’s account of the accident in his statement of claim is supported by his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.

> (b)     Whether the video footage produced supports the first defendant’s pleaded defence or the plaintiff’s allegations.

## Plaintiff’s claim is inconsistent with his affidavit of evidence-in-chief

14     The plaintiff’s claim, as set out in paragraph 5 of his statement of claim, is that:

>     … At or around 9.00 a.m. the Plaintiff together with the boom lift operator reached a portion of the road with a sharp 90 degree turn. The Plaintiff signalled to the operator to stop and so did the boomlift stop. The Plaintiff who was then 3 to 4 metres away, began to move forward so as to guide the operator through this sharp turn. Suddenly, and without signalling the boom lift operator that it was … safe and clear to resume movement, the boom lift made a sudden left hand turn causing the front right wheel to impact the Plaintiff before running his legs over.

15     However, the plaintiff’s account of the accident in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief is very different. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief at \[20\], the plaintiff states:

>     … At or around 9.00 a.m., I was walking along the middle of the road to avoid oncoming vehicles when the boomlift operator suddenly increased his speed of the boomlift without any warning. This caused the boomlift to move fast forward and the front right wheel impacted on me before running into my right leg.

16     The plaintiff’s evidence as set out in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief is fundamentally inconsistent with his position as set out in his statement of claim. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff claims that the accident was caused by the sudden left turn of the boom lift, whereas in the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff alleges that the accident was caused when the boom lift suddenly increased speed and moved fast forward.

17     The plaintiff’s position as set out in the aforesaid paragraph 5 of his statement of claim, is not supported by his own affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Furthermore, the video of the collision does not show the boom lift making a left turn at the time of the collision, as alleged by the plaintiff in his statement of claim. The court cannot make a finding of fact pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of claim, that is not supported by the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief or any other evidence.

## Video footage supports the first defendant’s defence

18     The video footage of the start of the journey of the boom lift shows that the plaintiff was walking to the right of the boom lift and to the right of the centre dividing line, where he could be seen by the boom lift operator. This supports the first defendant’s pleaded defence that “The Plaintiff’s duty was to be on the side of the boom lift at all times when the boom lift was being driven or in operation, so as to be within sight of the Operator.”[^10]

19     However, in the subsequent video footage just before the accident, the plaintiff is no longer walking to the right of the boom lift. Instead, the plaintiff can be seen walking in front of the boom lift, before he was hit by the boom lift.

20     The plaintiff sought to explain that because of the two big vehicles parked on the right at the start of the journey, the plaintiff could initially walk on the right of the road divider without having to worry about oncoming vehicles.[^11] However, the second video clearly shows that the road where the accident took place had a road shoulder on the right and there is no good reason why the plaintiff could not walk on the road shoulder on the right instead of walking in front of the boom lift.

21     The plaintiff’s evidence in cross-examination was that “I was told to walk in front of the vehicle so that vehicle would be able to follow my directions”.[^12] This allegation is inconsistent with the first video which shows the plaintiff walking alongside the right of the boom lift. Furthermore, the plaintiff only raised this allegation for the first time in cross-examination. This allegation was not pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of claim, nor was it raised in the plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief.

22     In _Mookan Sadaiyakumr v Kim Hock Corp Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 555</span>, the High Court decided that the plaintiff’s general pleading of failing to provide a safe and adequate work environment, was too general and inadequate to allow the plaintiff to rely on an allegation that the defendant had failed to install an automatic tripping mechanism, which was not specifically pleaded. The High Court held at \[30\], “the plaintiff cannot escape the consequences of inadequate pleading by pointing to the fact that he had raised the unpleaded facts during cross-examination”. Similarly, in the present case, I am of the view that the plaintiff cannot rely on his allegation that he was told to walk in front of the vehicle, which he only raised in cross-examination.

23     The plaintiff has submitted that the accident would not have occurred if the plaintiff and the Operator had been issued with walkie-talkies for effective communication.[^13] However, the second video clearly shows the plaintiff walking in front of the boom lift without looking at the boom lift at all. As the plaintiff was completely oblivious to the position of the boom lift, even if the plaintiff and the Operator had walkie-talkies, the plaintiff would not have used his walkie-talkie to tell the Operator to stop before the collision occurred.

## Plaintiff’s failure to plead his case

24     The plaintiff has further failed to plead his case in relation to:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s submission that the boom lift platform should have been raised.

> (b)     The plaintiff’s submission that the boom lift had encroached the road divider.

25     The plaintiff has submitted that the boom lift driver should have raised the boom lift platform so that the driver could see the plaintiff.[^14] In the plaintiff’s reply submissions, counsel for the plaintiff even went to the extent of producing an extract from the second video that was re-constructed to suggest that if the boom lift had been raised, there would have been a line of sight from the raised boom lift platform to the plaintiff. Counsel described the reconstruction as being “to the best of our ability”.[^15]

26     However, this allegation that the boom lift platform should have been raised, was not pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of claim. Furthermore, the reconstructed extract from the second video was only produced in the plaintiff’s reply submissions. The reconstruction was not put to the first defendant’s witnesses or produced during the trial, to enable the first defendant to respond to the reconstruction. In any event, there would be no need for a banksman to guide the boom lift, while it was being driven by an operator, if an operator could see in front of the boom lift.

27     The plaintiff has further submitted that the boom lift encroached the road divider.[^16] Again, this was not pleaded in the plaintiff’s statement of claim. In the premises, I am unable to make a finding of negligence against the defendant, based on a material fact that has not been pleaded.

## Conclusion

28     As the plaintiff’s own affidavit of evidence-in-chief and the video footage shown to the court do not support the account of the accident set out in the plaintiff’s statement of claim, the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. Parties were directed to file written submissions on costs, if they are unable to agree on costs.
