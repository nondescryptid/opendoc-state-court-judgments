### District Judge Seah Chi Ling:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 49-year-old male, claimed trial to a charge of unauthorised consumption of methamphetamine (the “**Charge**”), an offence under s. 8(_b_)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”). Three other charges for failure to present for urine test contrary to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Cap 185, Reg 3, 1999 Rev. Ed) were stood down.

2       The Accused had been previously been convicted under s. 33A(1) of the MDA for consumption of buprenorphine (the “**LT1 Offence**”) and had been sentenced to five years’ and six months’ imprisonment with three strokes of the cane on 2 November 2006[^1]. By reason of his prior conviction, the Accused is now liable for enhanced punishment under s. 33A(2) of the MDA (the “**LT2 Offence**”), which carries with it a mandatory imprisonment of not less than 7 years and not more than 13 years, and not less than 6 strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty of the Charge and sentenced him to eight years’ and nine months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The Accused has filed the present appeal against both conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s case

### Overview

4       The Prosecution’s case is built upon the presumption under s. 22 of the MDA, which creates a rebuttal presumption that the methamphetamine found in the Accused’s urine samples (as evidenced by two s. 16 MDA certificates[^2]) are attributed to his unauthorised consumption of the specified drugs. A total of 13 Prosecution Witnesses were called by the Prosecution to prove its case, comprising in the main Central Narcotic Bureau (“**CNB**”) officers and two analysts from the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”), as follows:

### Circumstances of the Arrest

5       The Prosecution’s account of the arrest was concisely summarised in the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions dated 28 August 2020 (“**PCS**”) at pages 2 to 8, which I have largely adopted for present purposes.

6       The arrest took place in the morning of 27 February 2018. PW1 ASP Prashant testified that on the morning of 27 February 2018, at about 9.45am, a team of Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) officers – comprising himself, PW2 Insp Malvern, PW3 Sgt James and PW4 Sgt Irwanudin (the “**arresting party**”) - conducted a spot check on the Accused outside the Home Suite View Hotel, located at Geylang Lorong 12, Singapore (the “**Hotel**”). After the Accused provided his particulars to the CNB officers, he attempted to flee[^3] from the arresting officers. He was caught and arrested on suspicion of having consumed a specified drug. During the arrest, the Accused put up a violent struggle and resisted arrest[^4]. He was eventually subdued. A reinforcement team - comprising PW5 SSgt Shahiran, PW10 SSSgt Ridwan, and W/Sgt PW11 W/Sgt Nur Shahirah (the “**reinforcement party**”) – subsequently arrived to assist in the investigations. The arrest report prepared by PW2 Insp Malvern was adduced in evidence as Exhibit P1.

7       One DW2 Radika d/o Rajavarma (“**DW2 Radika**”), the Accused’s then-girlfriend, approached the arresting officers as they were trying to subdue the Accused. A search of DW2 Radika’s bag by PW11 W/Sgt Nur Shahirah disclosed various drug items, and she was also arrested by the CNB officers at the Hotel.

8       The Accused and DW2 Radika were then escorted to room 316 which was registered in DW2 Radika’s name. A search was conducted of the room, but nothing incriminating was found. While in room 316, the Accused was, upon his request, given water to drink by PW2 Insp Malvern from a sealed cup that was in the hotel room.

### Procurement of the Urine Samples

9       The Accused and DW2 Radika were later escorted back to the CNB office of the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters (“**CNB Bedok**”). At CNB Bedok, the Accused provided his urine sample while being escorted by PW3 Sgt James. PW3 Sgt James testified that the Accused washed his hands, and thereafter selected one master bottle out of 20 bottles, and two smaller bottles out of 20 bottles, each one individually sealed[^5]. The Accused then urinated into the master bottle, before personally pouring the urine from the master bottles into the two smaller bottles, which he then held onto for the rest of the procurement procedure[^6]. The remaining urine in the master bottle was then siphoned for an Instant Urine Test (“**IUT**”) by PW3 Sgt James[^7].

10     PW7 SI Alvin was the IUT operator. The IUT test revealed that the Accused’s urine sample tested positive for amphetamines and benzodiazepines – see Exhibit P2. PW7 SI Alvin testified that he printed out the IUT slip[^8] and HSA labels with the Accused’s name and NRIC number[^9]. PW7 SI Alvin then passed the IUT slip and HSA labels to the sealing officer, PW5 SSgt Shahiran. PW5 SSgt Shahiran testified that he proceeded to confirm the details on both labels with the Accused before inviting the Accused to sign on both labels. The Accused did so. PW5 SSgt Shahiran then completed the sealing process of the two small bottles by sealing each bottle with masking tape, affixing the two signed HSA labels on each bottle, and placing another layer of clear tape over the two bottles, in the presence of the Accused[^10]. PW5 SSgt Shahiran then passed the two sealed bottles to the Accused, who personally dropped each bottle into a separate locked metal deposit box[^11]. These locked metal deposit boxes were then kept in a refrigerated unit in the CNB office.

11     The next day, on 28 February 2018, PW6 Chen Zhili Dominic retrieved the two locked metal deposit boxes containing the Accused’s sealed urine samples from the refrigerated unit and brought them to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”). The two locked metal deposit boxes were unlocked by the HSA and the Accused’s urine samples were submitted to the HSA for analysis[^12].

12     The Prosecution witnesses’ testimony was that the procurement of the Accused’s urine samples was carried out in accordance with the procedures set out in the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6, 1999 Rev Ed) (the “**MDA Regulations**”). The evidence of the CNB officers involved in the urine procurement process were consistent in this regard.

### Analysis of the Urine Samples

13     PW8 Chan and PW9 Evelyn, the two HSA analysts who had conduct of the analysis of the Accused’s urine samples that were sealed and marked “C-SG-18-00256-1 NANDAKISHOR S/O RAJ PAT AHIR SXXX” and “C-SG-18-00256-2 NANDAKISHOR S/O RAJ PAT AHIR SXXX”, respectively, independently issued two certificates – viz., Exhibit P3 and P4 - under s. 16 of the MDA (the “**s. 16 Certificates**”).

14     The Prosecution’s case is that under s. 16 of the MDA, a certificate purporting to be signed by an analyst employed by the HSA and relating to a controlled drug shall be admissible in evidence in any proceedings for an offence under the MDA and, until the contrary is proved, shall be proof of all matters contained within. Both P3 and P4 indicated that the Accused’s urine samples were found to be positive for the presence of Methamphetamine; both shall thus be taken as proof of the matters contained within.

15     PW8 Chan and PW9 Evelyn gave evidence describing the verifications that would be done at the point of submission to HSA, and both testified that there was nothing irregular about the Accused’s urine samples that were accepted for analysis[^13].

16     PW8 Chan and PW9 Evelyn also testified that for HSA to issue a certificate with a positive result for methamphetamine, methamphetamine at a concentration greater than 500 nanogrammes per millilitre of urine (i.e. the cut-off) had to be detected in the urine sample[^14]. In respect of the Accused’s urine samples, both analysts testified that methamphetamine at a concentration greater than 50,000 nanogrammes per millilitre of urine had been detected[^15], or 100 times the cut-off[^16].

### Prosecution’s Submissions

17     The Prosecution submitted that given the s. 16 Certificates showed that methamphetamine was found in Accused’s urine samples, the s. 22 MDA presumption applied. The Accused is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed the controlled drug in contravention of s. 8(b) of the MDA. The burden then shifts to the Accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not have either the _mens rea_ or the _actus reus_ of consuming the controlled drug. The numerous defences raised by the Accused, however, did not stand up to scrutiny, and he had accordingly failed to rebut both the s. 16 and s. 22 MDA presumptions up to the standard of proof required of him. The case against the Accused had therefore been made out beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Accused should accordingly be convicted for the offence under s. 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

## The Defence’s case

### Overview

18     The Accused protested his innocence and challenged the Prosecution’s case on multiple fronts. The Accused called the following witnesses in support of his defence:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="14.96%"> <col width="48.6%"> <col width="36.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Marking</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Name</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Role</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DW1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Nandakishor S/O Raj Pat Ahir</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Accused</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DW2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Radika D/O Rajavarma (“DW2 Radika”)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ex-girlfriend; inmate at Changi Women’s Prison</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DW3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Alim Abdul (“DW3 Alim”)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Inmate at Changi Prison</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     In the main, the Accused launched a three-pronged defence, namely: (a) he had been force-fed water by the CNB officers which was spiked with methamphetamine; (b) his urine was not properly procured, with the result that his urine sample was contaminated by the CNB; and (c) the urine samples analysed by HSA were in fact not his, but contained someone else’s urine.

20     Apart from the main defences above, the Accused also made various allegations against the CNB officers and HSA analysts, including that (a) he had been violently assaulted by the CNB officers at the point of arrest, (b) the CNB officers were in the habit of framing various individuals for drug offences and were corrupt, (c) his then-girlfriend DW2 Radika was a CNB informant who had colluded with the CNB officers to “spike” his drink, (d) the drug exhibits seized from DW2 Radika were not properly handled or investigated, (e) the inability of the HSA analysts to comment on the variance between his two urine samples had cast doubt on the reliability of the certificates, and (f) the CNB officers’ field diary (Exhibit D2) had not been properly recorded[^17].

### Accused’s account of the arrest

21     The Accused’s version of the event was that on the morning of 27 February 2018, he had ridden a bicycle to the Hotel to pick up his belongings from DW2 Radika’s room. At the car park of the Hotel, he was approached by a group of CNB officers. As he was being investigated for some “non-drug related offences” (the precise details of which were not specified by the Accused), he attempted to flee but was pinned down by the arresting officers. The arresting officers proceeded to assault him violently, “kicking and stomping” him “all over his body”[^18]. He claimed that the assault only stopped when DW2 Radika came out, shouted at the officers, and started filming the assault on her handphone[^19]. The reinforcement team subsequently arrived. The Accused claimed he was brought to the rear of the hotel foyer where he was searched. He asked for water, and for an ambulance to be called as he was feeling giddy and experiencing pain in his shoulder. Both requests were turned down by the CNB officers[^20].

22     Accused claimed that after spending some time in the lobby, he was brought to DW2 Radika’s room (room 316). By the time he arrived at the room, the search of the room had already been completed. Whilst in the room, he saw DW2 Radika and five other CNB officers – namely PW1 ASP Prashant, PW4 Sgt Irwanudin, PW5 SSgt Shahiran, PW10 SSSgt Ridwan and PW11 W/Sgt Nur Shahirah – enter the en-suite toilet for about five minutes[^21]. He claimed that the toilet was big enough to accommodate all six persons. Thereafter, PW4 Sgt Irwanudin emerged from the toilet, holding on to a bottle of mineral water with its seal broken. PW4 Sgt Irwanudin held the bottle to his eye level, and then proceeded to push the Accused’s forehead downwards and pour the water into the Accused’s mouth[^22].

### The spiking allegation

23     The Accused’s case was that the water that he was forced to drink was spiked with methamphetamine by the CNB officers. He claimed that the CNB’s officers have a motive for framing him as he had previously lodged a complaint against officers of CNB Bedok where he was required to present himself for regular urine testing under a supervision order. He claimed to have arrived 5 minutes late on one occasion, and the CNB Bedok officers had refused to allow him admission for his urine test. He asserted that the police report he lodged had made the CNB officers “look bad”[^23].

### The collusion allegation

24     The Accused further asserted that the CNB officers had colluded with DW2 Radika to set him up[^24]. He claimed that while the five CNB officers were with DW2 Radika in the toilet of room 316, they hatched a plan to spike his drink using methamphetamine found in DW2 Radika’s handbag (the “**collusion story**”). He indicated that DW2 Radika had “called up the police on four occasions in the past to get \[him\] arrested with … false and fabricated allegations”[^25]. He claimed that DW2 Radika had also informed her friends that she would get him arrested before her Court date[^26]. His suspicions that there was collusion between DW2 Radika and the CNB officers were also fuelled by the fact that she was allegedly released on station bail despite the CNB officers finding drugs and drug paraphernalia in her bag on 27 February 2018. He claimed that the deal between DW2 Radika and the CNB officers was that she would delete the recording of the assault in her handphone, and assist the CNB Officers in framing the Accused for the Charge. In return, she would be released on station bail, and not be charged under ss. 8(a), 8(b), and 9 of the MDA with respect to the items found in her possession on 27 February 2018[^27]. He also claimed that DW2 Radika offered sexual favours to PW1 ASP Prashant.

### Accused’s account of the urine procurement process

25     On his urine procurement, the Accused claimed that his urine samples were not procured in accordance with the MDA Regulations. He asserted that after he had urinated into the master bottle, PW5 SSgt Shahiran proceeded to siphon the urine in the master bottle with a test tube for the IUT testing, before the urine in the master bottle were poured into the 2 smaller bottles. The Accused claimed that the manner in which the urine procurement and transfer were carried out contravened Regulation 3(1) read with paragraphs 5(1) and 5(2) of the 1st Schedule of the MDA Regulations, which required the suspect’s urine specimen in the master bottle to be transferred into the 2 small containers for HSA analysis _first._ By siphoning a sample for the IUT first, this had the effect of contaminating the urine in the master bottle before two HSA samples could be extracted[^28].

### Inadequate proof that the urine samples were his

26     To further cast doubts on the Prosecution’s case, the Accused argued that the Prosecution had failed to prove that the urine tested by HSA was in fact his. He based his contention on the following: (a) the Prosecution did not tender any evidence to show that the urine bottles tested by HSA were affixed with labels signed by him; and (b) there was a huge discrepancy between methamphetamine concentration levels found in the IUT result (viz., 3,708.33 ng/ml[^29]) and the HSA results (viz, more than 50,000 ng/ml[^30]). This again supported the inference that the urine samples tested by the IUT operator and HSA could not be from the same source.

27     At trial, the Accused called one Alim Abdul (DW3) who testified that an ex-CNB informant, one Chowdory Nayan (“**Nayan**”), had revealed to him while they were occupying the same cell in Changi Prison that he (Nayan) had colluded with officers from the CNB to frame various persons, including DW3 Alim and the Accused. Nayan was however not called at trial as he had already been repatriated back to Bangladesh.

## My decision

28     At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. I accordingly convicted the Accused of the Charge accordingly. I set out the grounds of my decision below.

### The statutory presumptions

29     The Prosecution’s case is built upon the presumptions contained in ss 16 and 22 of the MDA. The Prosecution submits that in light of the s. 16 Certificates furnished by the HSA analysts, which showed that the Accused’s urine samples contained methamphetamine, the s. 22 MDA presumption applied to the present case.

30     Under s. 22 of the MDA, if any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under s. 31(4)(b) of the MDA, the accused person shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of s. 8(b) of the MDA. As the Court of Appeal noted in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> at \[10\] (“_Mohammad Ashik”)_:

> “The significance of compliance with section 31(4)(b) is that if there are positive results from both of the urine tests carried out pursuant to this subsection, _the s. 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of s. 8(b), consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine samples. This means that both the actus reus and the mens rea of the s. 8(b) offence are presumed by s. 22.” \[emphasis added\]_

31     Once the s. 22 MDA presumption applies, the Accused must prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not have either the _mens rea_ or the _actus reus_ of consuming the specified drug: see _PP v. Mohammad Ashik bin Aris_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 34</span> (High Court) at \[277\].

### Analysis of the Defence

32     As noted above, there are three main threads to the Accused’s defence, which I will address in the following order:

> (a)     The urine procurement process was not carried out in accordance with Regulation 3(1) of the MDA Regulations, which in turn led to a contamination of urine samples sent for HSA analysis (the “_Procedural non-compliance cum contamination defence_”)

> (b)     The two urine samples that were sent for HSA analysis did not belong to the Accused (the “_Wrong urine samples defence_”).

> (c)     The Accused was forcibly fed with water spiked with methamphetamine by the CNB officers (the “_Spiking defence_”)

#### The procedural non-compliance cum Contamination defence

33     As mentioned above, the Accused’s claim was that the sequence in which the urine samples were transferred for IUT testing, on one hand, and for HSA analysis, on the other, was not in accordance with Regulation 3(1) of the MDA Regulations. In fact, they were reversed. This effectively contaminated the urine in the master bottle before the 2 samples for HSA analysis could be extracted[^31].

#### Contention that Reg 3(1) of the MDA Regulations not complied with

34     Having considered the evidence, I found that the Accused has not shown on a balance of probabilities that the procurement and transfer of the urine samples was irregular, and that this led to a contamination of the HSA urine samples. I based my conclusion on the following.

35     First, PW3 Sgt James testified that the Accused had personally poured the urine from the master bottle into the two smaller bottles first. It was after this step was completed was the remaining urine in the master bottle siphoned for an Instant Urine Test (“**IUT**”) by PW3 Sgt James. The sequence and manner for the transfer of the urine from the master bottle into the 2 bottles for HSA analysis and into a test tube for the IUT were in full compliance with Regulation 3(1) of the MDA Regulations.

36     The Accused’s claim that the sequence of the transfer of the urine samples for IUT testing and the HSA analysis was reversed was, on the other hand, based on no more than his bare assertion. When pressed by the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“**DPP**”) for objective evidence to support his contention, all the Accused could do was to point to his statement recorded by the urine procurement officer, PW3 Sgt James – see Exhibit D1. It was not disputed that in D1, the actual sequence of the transfer of the urine samples was not recorded[^32]. According to the Accused, “the whole process of procuring the urine specimen” is usually documented, and that he could provide statements recorded by two different CNB divisions to prove this point[^33]. He claimed the fact that the CNB officers had failed to document the actual sequence of the transfer of the urine samples in this case showed that the correct sequence of the urine transfer was _in fact_ not followed[^34].

37     In my opinion, this argument is clearly _non-sequiter_. There is no legal nor logical basis for contending that the precise sequence of urine transfer must in all cases be documented in writing, failing which, an inference should be drawn that the correct procedures were not followed. The Accused failed to point to any legislative provisions or regulations that made it is mandatory for the urine procurement officer to document in writing the entire sequence of the urine procurement and transfer process in every case. He also did not produce the alleged statements from other CNB divisions which he claimed supported his assertion that a detailed documentation of every step of the urine procurement process in a written statement is an established practice. Even if these statements were provided, their probative values were necessarily negligible, as there was no reason why the practices of different CNB offices could not differ absent any legislative provision mandating the manner in which the urine procurement and/or transfer process must be documented (if at all). The Accused’s contention was in the final analysis based on no more than his bare assertion, and clearly insufficient to discharge his burden of proof, which was on a balance of probabilities.

#### Dispute over the identity of the Urine Procurement Officer

38     Secondly, in a bid to raise further doubts as to the propriety of the urine procurement process, the Accused went on to make another bare assertion, namely, that it was actually PW5 SSgt Shahiran who siphoned the urine into the test-tube for the IUT testing, and not PW3 Sgt James[^35] according to the Prosecution’s case. Despite making this assertion, the Accused never cross-examined PW5 SSgt Shahiran, nor put this contention to PW5 SSgt Shahiran during the latter’s cross-examination during the first tranche of the trial. Even if I were to accept that the Accused had mistaken PW5 SSgt Shahiran for PW4 Sgt Irwanudin (see below), and that it was PW4 Sgt Irwanudin who siphoned the urine for the IUT testing[^36], PW4 Sgt Irwanudin similarly was never crossed-examined on this point when he was recalled on Day 9 of the trial (except for a single put). This, in my view, is an unmeritorious attempt by the Accused to cast doubts on PW3 Sgt James’s testimony by raising bare, unsupported assertions, more of which will be noted later.

#### Contention that the HSA analysts did not “conduct” the urine tests

39     Thirdly, in his closing submissions, Accused further argued that the s. 31(4)(b) MDA procedures were not complied with, as the two HSA analysts who issued the s. 16 Certificates – namely, PW8 Chan and PW9 Evelyn (the “**HSA analysts**”) - did not personally “conduct” the urine test. The Accused cited the High Court decision of _Lim Boon Keong v. PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 451</span> (_“Lim Boon Keong”_) for the proposition that a HSA analyst could not be “said to have conduct of the test if he or she only \[reviewed\] the test results, as opposed to actually supervising the test process” (at \[39\]). The Accused’s case was that PW8 Chan and PW9 Evelyn did not actually supervise the laboratory officers who conducted the tests and had merely reviewed the test results. As such, they did not independently “conduct” the urine tests as required under s. 34(1)(b) of the MDA for the purpose of triggering the presumption under s. 22 of the MDA.

40      _Lim Boon Keong’s_ decision on what constituted “conduct” of a urine test for the purposes of s. 31(4)(b) of the MDA has, however, been clarified by the Court of Appeal in its subsequent decision of _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> at \[10\] (“_Mohammad Ashik”)._ In _Mohammed Ashik_, the Court of Appeal clarified that the word “conduct” in s. 31(4)(b) MDA did not necessarily mean that the analyst “has to personally carry out, or personally supervise in real time, each of the steps in the \[urine analysis\]” (at \[22\]). All that was required was that the analyst “should have regard to all the test results conducted by the laboratory officers before arriving at his conclusion” as set out in the s. 16 Certificates (at \[24\]). This was precisely what the HSA analysts testified they had done in the present case[^37], which evidence remained unchallenged in the course of trial. In my view, the evidence supported the conclusion that the HSA analysts had sufficient supervision of the urine tests such that they could claim responsibility for them and for the conclusions stated in the s. 16 Certificates (_Mohammed Ashik at_ \[26\]). The Accused’s contention that the PW8 Chan and PW9 Evelyn did not independently “conduct” the urine analysis as required under s. 34(1)(b) of the MDA was therefore wholly without merit.

41     Lastly, the Accused’s bare assertion that the procurement officer had wilfully disregarded the requirements of the MDA Regulations so as to have contaminated the urine samples siphoned for HSA analysis also flew in the face of his spiking defence which is discussed below. Assuming the Accused’s spiking defence could be believed, then, having allegedly gone through so much efforts to conspire with one another to orchestrate the spiking event, it would simply be illogical for the CNB officers to have been so lackadaisical in the urine procurement process, which would only have invited unnecessarily complications for them in the prosecution of the Accused for the drug consumption offence.

42     In light of the foregoing, the Accused has, in my view, failed to prove the “procedural irregularity cum contamination defence” on a balance of probabilities.

43     In coming to this conclusion. I have proceeded on the basis that the burden of proving any irregularities in the urine procurement and transfer process, which led to a contamination of the urine samples, fell on the Accused to establish on a balance of probabilities. Even if I were wrong on this point – i.e. that the burden was on the Prosecution to prove that the procedural requirements in s. 31(4)(b) of the MDA and Regulation 3(1) of the MDA Regulations have been fulfilled to trigger the s. 22 presumption – then, having regard to: (a) the fact that Accused’s defence on this issue was based on no more than the his bare assertions, (b) was premised on a wrong understanding of the law, and (c) was further logically unsound, I found that the Accused had similarly failed to cast a reasonable doubt on the propriety of the urine procurement process. The Prosecution has, in my opinion, proven the regularity of the urine procurement process beyond reasonable doubt in any event.

#### The Wrong Urine Samples Defence

44     I turn now to the “Wrong Urine Samples Defence”. Having considered the evidence, I found this defence to be without merit, and certainly not established up to the standard of proof required of the Accused.

#### Bare assertion that HSA urine samples were not the Accused’s

45     I start by nothing that both HSA analysts had testified at trial that there were no signs of tampering when the urine samples were handed over to HSA. They further testified that the urine labels were signed. The Accused, however, made the bare assertion that the urine samples were not his as the Prosecution had failed to failed to adduce evidence (e.g. photographic evidence) to show that the bottles containing the urine specimens tested by HSA were affixed with labels signed by him.

46     In my view, absent any evidence of mishandling or tampering of the urine samples, Accused’s mere assertion that the urine samples were not his as the signed labels were not sighted is insufficient to discharge the burden of proof required of him. I am fortified in my view as the “wrong urine samples defence” was not referenced in the Accused’s Case for Defence (Exhibit P6, “**CFD**”) at all, and was raised for the first time at trial. This would warrant an adverse inference being drawn against him as to the genuineness of this defence: see s. 169(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Red Ed) (“**CPC**”).

#### Time stamp on IUT Slip does not contradict Prosecution’s case

47     A further argument raised by the Accused that the urine analysed could not be his centred on the time stamp on the IUT Result Slip, which indicated that the “Date of Urine Test Proceed” was “27/02/2018 10:58” - see Exhibit P2. According to the Accused, the time stamp on the IUT Slip supported his argument that the urine tested could not be his, as it was impossible for the CNB officers and him to have returned to CNB Bedok from the Hotel by 10.58 am.

48     The Accused reasoned as follows:

> (a)     the arrest took place at 9.45am, as documented in the arrest report[^38];

> (b)     the time he and the CNB officers remained at the ground floor of the Hotel was 45 minutes, based on PW3 Sgt James’s testimony at trial[^39];

> (c)     he then spent around 30 to 40 minutes in room 316 with the CNB officers, based on PW10 SSSgt Ridwan’s testimony at trial[^40]; and

> (d)     the travelling time back to CNB took approximately 10 to 15 minutes.

49     The Accused argued that given he was first approached by the CNB officers at 9.45 am, having regard to the cumulative time spent at the Hotel and the travelling time back to CNB Bedok, the earliest time they could have arrived back at CNB Bedok would be 11.30am[^41]. Since the IUT recorded the time of generation of the slip as 10.58 am, the urine tested could not have belonged to the Accused.

50     In my view, this is a brazen attempt by the Accused at misquoting the evidence. As PW7 SI Alvin testified at trial, the time stamp of 10:58 on the IUT Slip was the registration timing, i.e. the entry time of the Accused’s particulars into the system in preparation for the IUT test, and not the time the urine was tested[^42]. This evidence was not challenged by the Accused[^43].

51     More significantly, none of the witnesses ever professed to give _precise_ estimates as to how much time was spent at the Hotel, or as to the time needed to travel back to CNB Bedok from the Hotel. The extracts of the transcripts of the different witnesses quoted by the Accused in his closing submissions showed that any time durations given by the Prosecution witnesses were mere estimates. For example, when asked by the Accused about the time duration between the Accused’s arrest and their arrival at room 316, PW3 Sgt James testified that it was “_not more than_ 45 minutes”[^44]. When the Accused questioned Sgt PW10 SSSgt Ridwan on the time spent at the Hotel, the latter’s response was that he “\[could not\] really recall”, and that he could only give estimates “based on his experience”. On that basis, he estimated the time spent at hotel to be “_roughly_ … _\[maybe\]_ 30-40 minutes”[^45]. Likewise, PW10 SSSgt Ridwan could not give a precise estimate of how long it took for the CNB team and the accused persons to travel back from the Hotel to CNB Bedok. PW10 SSSgt Ridwan’s testimony was that it depended on the road conditions and the driver, and he estimated the time needed to be around “10, 15 minutes”[^46].

52     Given the testimony of the witnesses, it is disingenuous for the Accused to take these time estimates out of context and hypothesize on that basis that they could not have reached CNB Bedok by 10.58am. As DW2 Radika herself testified:

> Q:    “….. did any of the officers ask you to delete the video you had taken?

> A:    Delete?

> ….

> Q:    Did they asked you to ---“If you delete the video, we won’t prosecute you”, did you?

> A:    No, no, no, no, nothing of this sort.

> ….

> A:    No, because , uh, _the movement was so fast_

> ….

> A:    E_verything was fast,---_

> Q:    Yah

> A:     _you know, to just faster go to the room, take, uh, whatever, you know and then just go out and ---_

> _Q:_     Yah

> A:     _that’s it. Next thing I know, we are all in the station_” [^47] .

> _(Emphasis added)_

#### Discrepancy between the IUT and the HSA test results

53     The Accused further made a big issue of the apparent huge discrepancy between the methamphetamine concentration levels detected in the IUT urine sample (i.e. 3,708.33 ng/ml)[^48] and the samples tested by HSA (i.e. more than 50,000 ng/ml). Accused claimed that this supported his contention that the urine samples tested by the IUT operator and HSA could not be from the same source.

54     I did not accept the Accused’s contention. The HSA analysts’ testimonies were consistent in that the IUT test carried out at the CNB office and the confirmatory test carried out at the HSA laboratories were analysing for different compounds. Based on the testimonies given by the HSA Analysts, it was clear that the IUT was a preliminary screening test, whose main purpose was to detect _a_ _class_ _of drugs, e.g. amphetamines_. The HSA confirmatory test, on the other hand, seeks to identify the concentration levels of the _specific drug substance_ in the urine samples, in the present case, _methamphetamine_ and its metabolites. The degree of specificity of the results expected from both tests are also different – one is a preliminary screening test; the other is a confirmatory test with a greater emphasis on the precision of the results.

55     PW8 Chan thus testified during her cross-examination by the Accused as follows:

> “Q    You have given evidence that this 50,000 nanogramme per ML and the CNB’s result slip is 3,708.33 nanogramme per ML. My question is, why is there a huge discrepancy \[sic\] or huge variance when the urine samples are one?

> A    Like I said previously, …. _the screening test done in CNB is a preliminary screening test_. That means, _it looks for the_ _class_ _of the amphetamine’s drug._ Therefore, I would read this slip as more than 500 nanogramme per mil and which is positive for the _amphetamine’s class_. Whereas for HSA, the 2nd test is confirmatory test _that identifies_ _the substance_ that was in the urine sample.”[^49]

> _(Emphasis added; edited for ease of reference)_

56     PW9 Evelyn’s testimony during her cross-examination by the Accused was consistent in this regard. She confirmed that the IUT test screens for _a class of compounds_, whereas the HSA test screens for _specific drugs_:

> Q    Madam, why is there an inconsistency \[sic\] in analysis of the urine specimen between the instant urine test and the HSA’s analysis result?

> A    Okay, Your Honour, as I mentioned earlier, _the IUT_, the screening test, _screens for a class of compounds_. This is similar to the screening test performed at HSA which screens off the negative samples. For positive samples, we will proceed with a confirmation test which is _more specific_ and we will … issue the result based on the confirmatory test.”[^50]

> _(Emphasis added; edited for ease of reference)_

57     In her re-examination by the DPP, PW9 Evelyn goes on to clarify the CNB screening test is based on a class of _amphetamine_ whereas the CNB confirmatory tests _specifically_ detects for _methamphetamine_ alone _and its metabolite_. The tests are thus different, and cannot be compared in the manner suggested by the Accused:

> “Q    Ms. Goh, I think throughout the course of the examination, we have tried to compare the results of the test. We have said IUT, 3,000. Confirmatory test, over 50,000. Do the test---_can the test results actually be compared in that direct manner?_

> A     _Your Honour, the test results shouldn’t be compared in that manner._

> Q    And why---why is that so?

> A    First, as I mentioned earlier, I do not have the details of the screening instrument over at CNB. Then it’s a screening test, _it’s based on a class of---__amphetamine class_. Whereas in our confirmation results, ….. _specifically, we are detecting for_ _methamphetamine_ _alone and as well as \[its\] metabolite._ So, we are actually detecting the _concentration of_ _methamphetamine__, \[and\] the detection of the metabolite_.

> Q    So, the test are different?

> A    Different. So, we are not able to compare them together”.[^51]

> _(Emphasis added; edited for ease of reference)_

58     Based on the above, it is clear that the Accused was attempting to apply a layman’s intuitive reasoning to exaggerate the variance in the results of the two tests. The HSA analysts have, however, given clear and persuasive testimony that the Accused’s comparisons were based on a wrong premise, given that the two tests are not analysing for the exact same compounds (i.e. testing for a _class_ of drugs, versus testing for a _specific_ drug).

59     In any event, the result of 3708.33 ng/ml set out in the IUT Result Slip was for _amphetamines._ When pressed by the Accused, PW9 Evelyn further testified that, while not documented in the s. 16 Certificates, the metabolite of methamphetamine, namely _amphetamine_, revealed in the IUT and the HSA tests only had a variance of 6%, which was within the internationally accepted standard variance of 20%. The results of the IUT tests and the HSA confirmatory tests were therefore consistent.[^52] The Accused, on his part, failed to adduce any expert evidence to establish the significance of the alleged variance between the results of the IUT and the HSA tests. The HSA analysts’ testimonies therefore stand uncontradicted. I find, therefore, that the Accused has not succeeded in casting any doubts on the accuracy of the HSA tests.

#### The Spiking defence

60     I turn now to the spiking defence, which appears to be the Accused’s key defence.

61     The main evidence relied on by the Accused to support the spiking defence was DW2 Radika’s evidence in court. The Accused pointed to several aspects of DW2 Radika’s account surrounding the “water feeding” incident, which were seemingly consistent with his. In particular, Accused noted that DW2 Radika testified that she saw a Malay officer give the Accused a water bottle with an open cap, and she “felt like they put something inside”[^53], and “somebody wanted \[to\] frame \[the Accused\] up” [^54] .

#### Problems with relying on DW2 Radika’s testimony as corroborative evidence

62     The Accused, however, runs into significant difficulties when relying on DW2 Radika’s testimony as corroborative evidence.

63     First, by DW2 Radika’s own account, she was very concerned about the Accused. She claimed that she took videos of the alleged assault to protect “my Nanda” [^55]. She admitted to being very concerned about the Accused[^56]. DW2 Radika’s evidence must therefore be assessed in light of the close and intimate relationship between DW2 Radika and the Accused (at least from DW2 Radika’s perspective).

64     Secondly, while there were some matches between DW2 Radika and Accused’s accounts, there were many contradictions as well. With reference to the assault, she described in vivid details the violent nature of the assault by the CNB officers. She mentioned that she witnessed external injuries on the Accused (his face looked “very bad”)[^57]. This was, however, wholly inconsistent with the Accused’s own account that there were no visible bruises and marks (except a contusion at his back)[^58]. The medical examination conducted on the Accused immediately after his arrest also did not suggest that the Accused sustained any bruises[^59]. By the Accused’s own account, his injuries were “internal”[^60].

65     Thirdly, DW2 Radika’s clear testimony was further that _no_ female officers were involved in the search of her room, nor in the toilet with her[^61]. This was inconsistent with Accused’s testimony that PW11 W/Sgt Nur Shahirah was in room 316, and was in fact one of the five CNB officers who were in the toilet together with DW2 Radika[^62].

66     Fourthly, a very significant discrepancy between DW2 Radika and the Accused’s account pertained to the issue of whether DW2 Radika was in fact colluding with the CNB officers. A central plank of the Accused’s defence was that DW2 Radika had colluded with the CNB officers to frame him and get him arrested. His case theory was that the scheme was hatched while DW2 Radika and the CNB officers had congregated in the toilet of room 316. The allegation of collusion was, however, unequivocally denied by DW2 Radika in court[^63]. She denied cutting deals with the CNB officers to frame the Accused in exchange for not being prosecuted, and denied being asked to delete the video[^64]. She claimed the video could no longer be retrieved as the phone was damaged when her children played with it. Indeed, the Accused went as far as to contend that the methamphetamine used to spike the drink came from DW2 Radika – i.e. RAD-01 in Exhibit D3 (being the drug items seized from Radika’s bag). The Accused’s contention was that if RAD-01 had been sent for DNA analysis, the DNA of the CNB officers would have been found on the stained packet[^65]. This again is inconsistent with DW2 Radika’s evidence.

67     Lastly, contrary to the Accused’s assertion that Radika was never charged by virtue of her alleged collusion with the CNB officers. Radika testified in court that the CNB did in fact prosecute her on consumption charges (viz., methamphetamine), and that she had pleaded guilty to the charge.[^66]

68     In my view, while there were _som_e similarities, there were, by comparison, _far more_ material inconsistencies between the Accused’s account and DW2 Radika’s account of what transpired on 27 February 2018. One of them must have been lying in so far as the areas of discrepancies were noted. Accused submitted that he had not seen Radika for the last two-and-a-half years. The fact that their testimonies matched showed that he must be telling the truth. The Accused’s argument is, however, premised on the supposition that the Accused and Radika, both of whom are incarcerated now, have not met since 27 February 2018. The precise period of Radika’s incarceration was, however, never properly established in this court. Even if it were true that both the Accused and Radika had been incarcerated throughout this time, communications between Accused and Radika could still have been facilitated through intermediaries (such as mutual friends), who could have visited both the Accused and Radika in prison. In my mind, the Accused cannot selectively choose to rely on those parts of DW2 Radika’s testimony that were supportive of his case, while disregarding the glaring inconsistencies between their testimonies on material points. Viewed as a whole, the weight to be given to DW2 Radika’s testimony as corroborative evidence would necessarily be very limited.

#### Accused’s inconsistent position of who force fed him the spiked drink

69     The Accused’s own testimony of the spiking incident was also highly problematic in my view.

70     First, his identification of the officer who allegedly forced fed him the spiked drink changed materially as the trial progressed. He testified during the first tranche of the trial that it was PW5 SSgt Shahiran who force fed him the spiked drink. This was incidentally also the position he took in his CFD. However, at the start of the Defence’s case, he caught the Prosecution and the court by surprise when he claimed for the first time, during his examination-in-chief, that it was in fact PW4 Sgt Irwanudin who force fed him the water. He claimed he mistook the two CNB when he first saw them at the first tranche of the trial. He claimed that this was a genuine, honest mistake[^67], and blamed the Prosecution for providing him with a copy of the CNB team’s Field Diary[^68] as well as a copy of his statement recorded on 18 October 2018[^69] only after trial had started.

71     I did not find his claim of mistaken identification of the CNB officer who force-fed him the drink convincing.

72     First, the spiking defence was evidently the key defence relied upon by the Accused. Yet, on the critical issue of who the alleged CNB officer who force fed him was, he claimed he made the serious mistake of misidentifying PW5 SSgt Shahiran for PW4 Sgt Irwanudin. The was despite the fact that the alleged perpetrator stood right in front of him, had allegedly tilted back his head and forced the spiked drink into his mouth. His assertion that his memory failed him on this critical aspect of his defence is highly suspect in my view, especially when he professed to possess an impeccable recollection of other details - e.g. the officers that were part of the arresting party, the officers that were part of the reinforcement party, the officer who searched DW2 Radika’s bag, the officers who were in the toilet with Radika, the officer who procured his urine, among others.

73     Secondly, I also found it noteworthy that PW4 Sgt Irwanudin and PW5 SSgt Shahiran took the stand on the same day (i.e. day 3 of the trial), one after the other, with PW4 Sgt Irwanudin testifying first, followed immediately by PW5 SSgt Shahiran. Having seen both officers face to face in close proximity in time with each other, I found it unbelievable that it did not occur to the Accused as he was cross-examining the 2 witnesses, that he had in fact mistaken the two officers. Indeed, it was only after the court had reconvened after a 5-month break for a new tranche of the trial, that the Accused raised for the first time that he had mixed up the identities of the two officers.

74     Thirdly, according to the Accused’s own account, he seemed to be familiar with PW5 SSgt Shahiran. He put it to PW5 SSgt Shahiran during cross-examination that he had met PW5 SSgt Shahiran at CNB Bedok before when he reported for his urine supervision. Accused claimed that when he was tested for benzodiazepine in or around May 2017, PW5 SSgt Shahiran was the sealing officer[^70]. He also claimed that he had “no doubt” that PW5 SSgt Shahiran was the person who called him sometime in February 2018 to purchase 0.5 grams of methamphetamine in an attempt to entrap him[^71], only to change his position and claim that he meant PW4 Sgt Irwanudin on Day 7 of the trial. He also pointed out PW5 SSgt Shahiran as the procurement officer, to contradict the Prosecution’s version that it was PW3 Sgt James who oversaw the procurement of the Accused’s urine at the CNB office. Given his ability to pinpoint PW5 SSgt Shahiran as the person who was involved in various other aspects of the investigations, I found it highly suspicious that on the key issue of who force-fed him the “spiked” drink, he could have committed the serious mistake of midentifying PW5 SSgt Shahiran for PW4 Sgt Irwanudin.

75     In his reply closing submissions, Accused blamed his misidentification of the two officers on the investigating officer for not carrying out an identification (“ID”) parade. It should however be noted that the spiking defence was raised by the Accused; it was not part of the Prosecution’s case. There was no need for the Prosecution to hold any ID parade as it was not the Prosecution’s case that there was a spiking incident to begin with. This was all the more so as the operation of s. 22 MDA presumption had shifted the proving of all defences to the Accused. The onus of proving all essential facts on which his defence was based fell on the Accused, on a balance of probabilities.

#### Lack of motive by the CNB officers to frame the accused

76     A further critical weakness in the Accused’s defence, in my view, was his inability to put forward a convincing case as to the CNB officers’ motive for framing him. His story was that the CNB officers bore a grudge against him when he lodged a police report against them for refusing to conduct a urine test for him when he turned up at CNB Bedok a few minutes late[^72]. He asserted that he had filed a police report against the CNB officers which made them “look bad”[^73]. Consequently, they had an axe to grind against him. He asserted that that the police report, if made available by the Prosecution, would prove that his account[^74].

77     However, when the police report was admitted by the Prosecution into evidence as Exhibit P7, it became apparent that all the Accused said in the report was that he was late for the urine test by 5 minutes, and no one in the office opened the door when he knocked or attended to him. It was difficult to see how this report had cast the CNB officers in bad light, especially when it was the Accused who, by his own admission, had arrived late for the urine test. Objectively construed, the police report appeared to have been lodged by the Accused to protect himself against possible prosecution for failure to report for the scheduled urine test. Indeed, the Accused eventually conceded during his cross-examination that the report did not make the CNB officers look bad[^75].

78     The above notwithstanding, in what has become a characteristic tactic of the Accused, the Accused made yet another bare assertion for the first time in his _reply closing submissions_, that there was in fact a second statement recorded by the police contemporaneous with P7 which was not adduced at trial. According to the Accused, the contents of this second statement, had it been disclosed, would have cast the CNB officers in a bad light[^76]. Suffice it to say that P7 was admitted into evidence (by consent) to establish if the police report lodged by the Accused did in fact make the CNB officers look bad. If there were in fact another police report lodged by the Accused (which the Prosecution denies) which would have supported his allegations, then it was curious why the Accused made no mention of this “second police report” during the trial itself when he was questioned at length on P7. In fact, this “second police report” was not mentioned at all in the Accused’s lengthy written closing submission as well, and was only raised for the first time in his reply closing submissions. In my mind, it is clear that the “second police report” was conjured by the Accused as a clear afterthought to plug a very big gap in his defence, namely the absence of any motive on the part of the CNB officers to frame him. His contention that the CNB officers had a reason to conspire together to orchestrate such an elaborate scheme to frame him completely falls apart.

#### Alleged failure to send RAD-01 for DNA analysis

79     Accused claimed further that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for not sending the stained packet found in DW2 Radika’s bag on 27 February 2018, and reflected as “RAD-01” in Exhibit D3, for DNA analysis (the stained packet, hereinafter referred to as “**RAD-01**”). An important detail of his “spiking defence” was that the methamphetamine used by the CNB officers to spike his drink came from RAD-01. His story was that if RAD-01 had been sent for DNA analysis, the DNA profiles of the CNB officers who spiked his drink would have been detected on the stained packet. The CNB officers therefore deliberately omitted to send RAD-01 for DNA analysis to avoid their DNA from being detected[^77].

80     This was, however, yet again another conjecture on his part, not backed by any credible evidence. There is, in my view, no basis whatsoever for drawing an adverse inference against the Prosecution for failing to send RAD-01 for DNA analysis as the exhibit was found in DW2 Radika’s possession, not the Accused’s. The Accused was further not charged in relation to any of the exhibits found in DW2 Radika’s possession. Indeed, the contention that the methamphetamine came from RAD-01 was raised by the Accused for the first time at trial. There was no way the Prosecution could have anticipated that the Accused would raise the contention that the methamphetamine used in the spiked drink came from RAD-01.

81     Quite apart from not helping his defence, unsubstantiated allegations such as these, which has become a prominent feature of the manner in which the Accused conducted his defence, only served to undermine his credibility. Not only that, it also largely undermined the credibility of his own witness, DW2 Radika, whose testimony he is placing significant reliance on by way of corroborative evidence.

#### Alim Abdul’s testimony

82     At trial, the Accused called one Alim Abdul (DW3) as a defence witness. DW3 Alim is currently serving an imprisonment term for drug trafficking offences. According to DW3 Alim, Chowdory Nayan (“**Nayan**”) had admitted to him while they were incarcerated together at B3 Institution (Prisons) that he (Nayan) was a CNB informant and that he had reported to CNB that there were drugs in the house where DW3 Alim was residing, which led to DW3 Alim’s arrest. Nayan had further confirmed to DW3 Alim that PW3 Sgt Shahiran had called Nayan at the time of the Accused’s arrest on 27 February 2018.

83     In my mind, reliance on DW3 Alim’s testimony carries the Accused nowhere. I cannot see how the fact that Nayan had framed DW3 Alim, even if true, was relevant to the present trial which involved the Accused. DW3 Alim, in any event, confirmed that allegations of him being set up by Nayan was raised by his lawyer during his own trial but was rejected by the trial judge, and his appeal was further dismissed by the appellate court[^78].

84     On the second aspect of DW3 Alim’s testimony, even if I were to accept his account that Nayan did in fact call PW3 Sgt Shahiran on the day of the Accused’s arrest, that at its highest only showed that Nayan was a CNB informant. It had no direct bearing on whether the CNB officers had a motive for framing the Accused, or whether the Accused did or did not in fact consume drugs. In fact, it suggested the contrary – that the Accused was possibly involved in drug related activities at the Hotel on 27 February 2018, thereby prompting Nayan to tip-off CNB. In any event, Nayan was not in court to give testimony. Any out of court assertions by Nayan adduced through DW3 Alim constitute inadmissible hearsay evidence.

85     Viewed as a whole, I find that the Accused has fallen way short of proving the Spiking Defence on a balance of probabilities.

## OTHER DISPUTES RAISED BY THE ACCUSED

### General Observations

86     A perusal of the trial transcripts would reveal the Accused’s attempts at attacking practically all of the Prosecution’s evidence at every available opportunity. The Accused raised a litany of disputed facts, including alleging that he was violently assaulted, challenging the route the CNB officers took when they arrived at the hotel, where the arresting party parked their car, the exact composition of the arresting party versus the reinforcement party, the identity of the officer who searched DW2 Radika’s bag (whether a male or female officer), etc. In my mind, all of these were not directly relevant to the defences raised by the Accused as discussed above. These subsidiary disputed facts which the Accused sought to capitalise on were further either based on his bare assertions, on conjectures, or attempts to leverage on the imprecision in the use of words by the witnesses during different parts of their testimonies, or minor discrepancies in their recollection of details. I will only delve deeper into three further points raised by the Accused as these were given some emphasis by the Accused in his closing submissions and/or reply submissions.

### The Field Diary

87     The Accused argued that the Field Diary given to him was incomplete and/or did not support the details narrated by the prosecution witnesses in court. The content of the Field Diary was admittedly rather brief. However, as PW2 Insp Malvern, the recorder of the Field Diary testified in court, the timings recorded in Field Diary was meant to be a “rough guide of the arrest”[^79]. PW2 Insp Malvern was tasked with escorting the accused, and thus had to be focussed on this more critical task. He testified that he did not have the luxury of time to record every single detail into the field diary, including a detailed breakdown of the time at which each of the material events during the arrest took place. The events captured in the Field Diary was understood to form “part of the continuous process … of the operations” starting from 9.45 am[^80]. I accepted PW2 Insp Malvern’s explanation, which was, in my view, reasonable and logical. I could not see how an excessive focus on the brevity of the Field Diary assisted the defence’s case.

### Failure to call IO Jaelyn Ng

88     The Accused also invited the court to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for failing to call IO Jaylen Ng, who was the investigating officer at the time of, and in the period immediately following, the Accused’s arrest on 27 February 2018, as a witness. Two medical certificates were, however, tendered by the Prosecution to show that IO Jaylen was unfit to attend court proceedings for an extended period of time due to a serious medical condition[^81]. The Prosecution was further relying on the on the statutory presumptions in s. 16 and 22 of the MDA, as well as the testimony of 13 prosecution witnesses, to prove their case. It was fully within the Prosecution’s prerogative to determine if it was necessary to call IO Jaelyn as a witness given her medical condition. The Accused’s contention that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution in this regard is misplaced.

### Failure to call the Hotel Manager

89     True to form, the Accused, not unexpectedly, also requested the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for failing to call the manager of the Hotel as a witness at trial. In the course of the trial, the Accused had disputed whether the Hotel provided water in cup form or bottle form. He also disputed the size of the toilet in room 316, specifically whether it was large enough to accommodate six persons in line with his “collusion story” (see \[24\] above). On day 7 of the trial, the Prosecution extended a copy of the letter from the Hotel to the Accused, which appeared to have addressed the issue of the type of water provided by the Hotel[^82]. The Accused chose not to adduce this letter into evidence, nor to subpoena the Hotel Manager as a witness. This, however, did not stop the Accused from contending in his closing submissions that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for failing to call the Hotel manager as a witness.

90     In light of the position taken by the Accused in his closing submissions, a few days before the parties were due to return for oral reply submissions, Prosecution made an application to reopen their case and call the Hotel manager and Hotel director (the “**additional witnesses**”) as rebuttal witnesses pursuant to s. 230(t) of the CPC. The additional witnesses were in fact subpoenaed and ready to testify on the return date of the oral reply submissions. The Accused, however, objected strenuously to the Prosecution’s application, even though he could not explain what prejudice he might suffer given the limited scope of the evidence the additional witnesses were likely to cover[^83]. At the same time, he maintained that an adverse inference should still be drawn against the Prosecution for not calling these witnesses earlier during the trial. Given the position taken by the Accused in objecting to Prosecution’s application to call the hotel representatives as rebuttal witnesses, I did not think it would be reasonable for the Accused to argue at this juncture that the non-calling of the hotel witnesses would warrant an adverse inference being drawn against the Prosecution.

91     As noted above, the Accused had raised a wide range of arguments in a bid to raise doubts in the Prosecution case. The Accused is of course entitled to prove his innocence by adducing relevant evidence and/or attacking the Prosecution’s evidence. The problem lies in that a large part of his contentions related to matters that did not go directly to the heart of the dispute, namely whether he was forced-fed a spiked drink, whether his urine sample was contaminated in the course of the urine procurement process, whether the urine samples tested by HSA belonged to him and/or whether the CNB officers had a motive for framing him. The arguments were further, in most part, based on bare assertions or conjectures. These were, in my view, deliberate attempts by the Accused at creating doubts at every available opportunity, despite his knowledge that there were no objective evidence to back up his assertions. Instead of raising doubts in the Prosecution’s case, these indiscriminate attempts at raising disputes only showed the Accused to be an non-credible witness who was quick to tailor his evidence as he went along, prone to changing his position on pertinent issues, and prone to raising frivolous unsubstantiated assertions on irrelevant or tangential points solely in a bid to muddy the evidence.

## CONCLUSION

92     Considering the evidence in their totality and having regard to the fact that the ss 16 and 22 presumptions applied in the present case, I am of the view that the Accused had failed to rebut the presumption of consumption on a balance of probabilities. The Prosecution has thus proven the s. 8(b)(ii) MDA charge against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

93     The Accused therefore stands convicted as charged.

## SENTENCE

94     The present charge is not the Accused’s first LT2 offence. He was convicted under s. 33A(2) MDA for his first LT2 offence and sentenced on 20 November 2012 to an imprisonment term of 7 years’ 6 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. Prosecution urged this court to impose a sentence of 8 years’ and 9 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for the current Charge.

95     The starting point for a second LT2 offence in a Plead Guilty (“**PG**”) scenario is 8 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane: see _Cheang Geok Lin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 548</span>.

96     Here, the Accused claimed trial and is not entitled to a PG discount. I agree with the Prosecution that the manner in which the Accused conducted the trial was objectionable and opportunistic. The Accused unduly protracted the trial by raising numerous bare assertions that were in the final analysis not backed by any credible evidence. The Accused was quick to cast aspersions on the character of the prosecution witnesses, all of which were ultimately unsubstantiated and based on no more than his bare allegations. Despite having been given a full opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses, he applied to recall four prosecution witnesses. When his request was allowed, he was reminded repeatedly not to go beyond the agreed-upon scope of recall, but he chose opportunistically to do so whenever the chance presented itself.

97     He further made requests for the Prosecution to procure numerous witnesses and to procure numerous evidences on his behalf. Besides DW2 Radika and DW3 Alim, he additionally requested for one Paul Praveene Arulmani, one Shanker s/o Sabapathy, and one Bepari Md Rajib to be called as Defence witnesses. After the witnesses were located and duly subpoenaed and/or brought up from prisons, the Accused informed the court and the Prosecution that he would not be calling these witnesses afterall[^84].

98     Despite clear medical evidence that IO Jaelyn Ng was not fit to testify in court due to her ailments, the Accused was insistent that IO Jaelyn Ng be called, arguing that an adverse inference should otherwise be drawn against the Prosecution.

99     Given that the Accused had chosen to claim trial, he is not entitled to any sentencing discount. Coupled with the manner of the conduct of his case, I found that the sentence sought by the Prosecution is eminently fair and appropriate in the circumstances. I therefore sentenced the Accused to 8 years and 9 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane, and ordered the sentence to be backdated to 7 March 2018, being his date of first remand after being charged in court for the present offence.

100    The Accused is dissatisfied with my judgement and has filed the current appeal against both conviction and sentence. He is currently remanded at Changi Prison pending the outcome of the appeal.
