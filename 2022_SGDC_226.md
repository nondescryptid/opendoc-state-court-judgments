Courts and Jurisdiction – District Court

28 September 2022

### Deputy Registrar Jonathan Ng Pang Ern:

1       This was an assessment of damages pursuant to an interlocutory judgment which was entered at 50% against the Defendant. The amount claimed was initially $327,052.15 on a 50% basis, which clearly exceeded the District Court limit of $250,000. When confronted with this, the Plaintiff was willing to cap her claim at $250,000 or, alternatively, reduce it to $235,640.13. But were these sufficient to give the District Court jurisdiction to hear and try the action?

2       After considering parties’ submissions, I took the view that: (a) it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000; and (b) “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis, and not the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account. Taken together, these meant that, unless the Plaintiff was willing to cap her claim at $125,000, I did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the assessment of damages.

3       When I rendered my decision on 26 September 2022, I indicated to parties that full written grounds would soon follow. Pursuant to that, these are the grounds of my decision.

## Background

4       The Plaintiff commenced this suit against the Defendant on 15 May 2015. The suit arose out of an accident that occurred on the Defendant’s premises. Parties entered consent interlocutory judgment on 15 May 2019. Under this interlocutory judgment, liability was apportioned against the Defendant at 50%.

5       The first tranche of the assessment of damages was fixed for a full-day hearing before me on 29 August 2022. In the Joint Opening Statement filed on 22 August 2022, the Plaintiff quantified her claim at $327,052.15 on a 50% basis (and $654,104.30 on a 100% basis). The heads of claim comprised: (a) pain and suffering/loss of amenities; (b) loss of future earnings/loss of earning capacity; (c) future medical expenses and treatments; and (d) special damages (for medical expenses, transport expenses, purchase of wheelchair and crutches and pre-trial loss of income).

6       At the hearing on 29 August 2022, I highlighted to parties that the Plaintiff’s claim appeared to exceed the District Court’s jurisdiction. Counsel for the Defendant, Mr Appoo Ramesh, informed me that he had brought this issue to the attention of Counsel for the Plaintiff, Ms Cecilia Hendrick, when the Joint Opening Statement was served on him on 22 August 2022. He subsequently received a draft memorandum under s 23 of the State Courts Act 1970 from Ms Hendrick on 26 August 2022. While he had no instructions on this draft memorandum, he candidly informed me that he would not be advising his client to agree to enlarge the District Court’s jurisdiction pursuant to s 23 of the State Courts Act 1970.

7       In response, Ms Hendrick indicated that the Plaintiff was willing to submit to the District Court’s jurisdiction pursuant to s 22 of the State Courts Act 1970. I understood this to mean that the Plaintiff would be willing to _cap_ her claim at $250,000. However, Mr Ramesh, relying on the District Court’s decision in _K Jeyakumar Naikar v Huationg Contractor Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 146</span> (“_Jeyakumar_”), submitted that this was insufficient, and that the Plaintiff had to _positively identify_ the specific parts of her claim which she was abandoning. Ms Hendrick maintained that s 22 of the State Courts Act 1970 allowed the Plaintiff to simply cap her claim at $250,000, but she was prepared go along with Mr Ramesh’s interpretation so that the hearing could proceed. To this end, the multiplier for the Plaintiff’s loss of future earnings/loss of earning capacity claim was halved, bringing the overall claim to $235,640.13 on a 50% basis (and $471,280.25 on a 100% basis).

8       At this juncture, a further issue emerged: was it sufficient that the Plaintiff’s claim fell within the District Court’s jurisdiction on a 50% basis, or did the Plaintiff’s claim also have to fall within the District Court’s jurisdiction on a 100% basis? Ms Hendrick argued, on the authority of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 839</span> (“_Keppel_”), that the former sufficed. Mr Ramesh, on the other hand, pointed out that _Keppel_ appeared to be based on a provision in the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) which was worded differently. As things stood, he was not prepared to accept that _Keppel_ provided an answer to this issue.

9       It appeared to me that these jurisdictional issues were not clear cut. It was also apparent to me that parties were not fully prepared to argue these issues (the two cases cited were identified during two brief stand-downs in the course of the morning). For these reasons, I was not prepared to render a decision on the fly. As a practical matter, I was prepared to proceed with the taking of evidence if parties were agreeable to deferring these issues to be decided at a later juncture. Indeed, Ms Hendrick made it very clear that she wanted the hearing to proceed. However, Mr Appoo was adamant that these issues be determined first.

10     I was mindful that s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 provides that a District Court does not have jurisdiction to “hear and try” any action which falls outside its jurisdiction. In these circumstances, I was not prepared to proceed with the hearing without Mr Appoo’s agreement. I therefore vacated the hearing in the afternoon, and gave directions for the filing and exchange of written submissions.

## Issues

11     The issues I had to determine were:

> (a)     whether it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000; and

> (b)     whether “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis or the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account.

## Parties’ submissions

12     Parties subsequently filed their written submissions on 12 September 2022.

13     On the first issue, the Plaintiff submitted that she only needed to state that she abandoned any award in excess of the District Court limit.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) According to the Plaintiff, this approach was followed by a string of District Court decisions.[^2]

14     On its part, the Defendant, relying on _Jeyakumar_, submitted that, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, a claimant had to positively abandon the excess of his claim and could not merely confirm at the commencement of the hearing that the claim was limited to $250,000.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) Thus, the Plaintiff had to state categorically in writing, by either amending the Statement of Claim or the Joint Opening Statement, which parts of her claim she was abandoning.[^4]

15     On the second issue, the Plaintiff submitted that _Keppel_ stood for the proposition that the maximum sum the District Court could award was after apportionment of liability was applied.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) Reliance was also placed on s 3(3) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 (which was referred to in _Keppel_ at \[30\])[^6] and two District Court decisions which supposedly continued to apply the legal position in _Keppel_ even after the 2010 amendments to the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed).[^7]

16     On the other hand, the Defendant submitted that _Keppel_ was premised on the specific words of s 20(1)(_a_) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed),[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) which were no longer present in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970.[^9]_Keppel_ had therefore been overtaken by legislative amendments and could not be taken to represent the law.[^10] Turning to first principles, the Defendant submitted that the words “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 should consistently refer to the amount claimed on a 100% basis, and should not bear a different meaning depending on whether liability had been resolved.[^11] Moreover, the Plaintiff’s interpretation would result in uncertainty as to where a claim ought to be commenced in.[^12] Finally, it was also said that the Defendant’s interpretation was consistent with a number of other legislative provisions.[^13]

## Decision

### The first issue: abandonment of excess

17     The first issue was whether it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000.

18     In its present form, s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 provides as follows:

> **Abandonment of part of claim to give District Court jurisdiction**

> **22.**—(1)    Where —

>> (_a_)    the amount claimed in an action exceeds the District Court limit, or any remedy or relief sought in an action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit; and

>> (_b_)    a District Court would have jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action if the amount or value (as the case may be) did not exceed the District Court limit,

> the claimant _may abandon the excess amount or that remedy or relief_, as the case may be, and thereupon a District Court has jurisdiction under section 19(2) to hear and try the action, except that the claimant cannot in that action —

>> (_c_)    recover an amount exceeding the District Court limit; and

>> (_d_)    obtain any remedy or relief in respect of the subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.

> \[emphasis added\]

19     I pause to note that this current version of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 was introduced by s 50(_c_) of the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021. It appears that, by virtue of s 224(1) and (2) of the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021, the version of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 that governs this suit is the version of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 that was in force on 31 March 2022. However, nothing turns on this as the only amendment brought about by s 50(_c_) of the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021 was the change in the reference from “plaintiff” to “claimant”.

20     The starting point of the analysis is _Jeyakumar_. In _Jeyakumar_, the Deputy Registrar held that (at \[14\]) that the word “abandon” signals a positive course of action, and that the mere act of suing sums in excess of $250,000 in the District Court does not constitute an abandonment of the amount in excess of that. The Deputy Registrar further held (at \[24\]) that abandonment requires an express act of the claimant, which “could come in the form of” the claimant amending his Statement of Claim and/or the Opening Statement.

21     I agree with all these aspects of _Jeyakumar_. However, _Jeyakumar_ does not fully answer the question of whether it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000. This is because this option was never presented to the Deputy Registrar in _Jeyakumar_. Instead, the plaintiff in _Jeyakumar_ had argued that the act of pursuing a claim in excess of $250,000 in the District Court _implied_ that he intended to abandon the excess amount (see _Jeyakumar_ at \[12\]). In addition, the Deputy Registrar in _Jeyakumar_ only went so far as to hold (at \[24\]) that the express act required _could_ (not must) come in the form of the claimant amending his Statement of Claim and/or the Opening Statement. In these circumstances, I do not read _Jeyakumar_ as foreclosing the possibility that it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000.

22     In my view, it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000.

23     First, the language of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 only requires the claimant to abandon: (a) the excess amount that exceeds the District Court limit; or (b) the remedy or relief sought that is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit. It does not prescribe the acts that are sufficient to constitute such abandonment. As mentioned previously, I agree with the holding in _Jeyakumar_ (at \[14\] and \[24\]) that abandonment requires a positive or express act. While amending the Statement of Claim and/or the Opening Statement would clearly qualify as such a positive or express act, I am of the view capping one’s claim at $250,000 would equally qualify, provided this capping is positively or expressly represented (whether orally or in writing) to the Court.

24     Second, this interpretation leads to a more coherent reading of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970. Upon the claimant’s act of abandonment, the District Court acquires jurisdiction to hear and try the action, except that under sub-paragraphs (_c_) and (_d_), the claimant _cannot_ recover an amount exceeding the District Court limit (sub-paragraph (_c_)) and obtain any remedy or relief in respect of the subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit (sub-paragraph (_d_)). If the act of abandonment is limited only to amending the Statement of Claim and/or the Opening Statement, sub-paragraphs (_c_) and (_d_) would serve little purpose because the amended claim in such a scenario would _already_ be quantified at a sum below the District Court limit. Conversely, if the act of abandonment includes the act of capping one’s claim at $250,000, then this would give meaning to sub-paragraphs (_c)_ and (_d_): the claim, as quantified, is _still_ above $250,000 and so the qualifications in these sub-paragraphs are necessary.

25     Third, I am cognisant that \[16\] of _Jeyakumar_ could raise some concerns with hiving off any excess above $250,000:

> In my judgment, the draftsman’s decision to impose the duty on the claimant – and not the court – to hive off the excess amount of the claim was made for good reason. While neither party cited extrinsic materials on this, in my view requiring the court to bear that responsibility would place the court in a rather invidious position. Where an action comprises multiple heads of claim of different amounts, and the judgment sum exceeds $250,000, how is the court supposed to decide which heads of claim to hive off in order to meet the requisite amount of $250,000? Is the court’s decision to hive off one head of claim but not the others appealable, and if so on what grounds? To further complicate matters, not all claims are homogeneous. For instance, in the present case, the claim comprises both general and special damages. It is trite that general and special damages attract different rates of pre-judgment interest (_Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> at \[151\]). Hiving off the award for one type of claim as opposed to others would evidently have a knock-on effect on the amount of interest recoverable on the judgment sum. There may also be cost implications, as costs could be assessed separately for each discrete head of claim, having regard to the judgment sum awarded for each head of claim. …

26     However, in my view, any decision the Court arrives at with regard to the hiving off of any excess forms part of the Court’s decision in the matter, and the normal rules on appealability would apply. As for the concerns relating to how the Court should decide which heads of claim to hive off, as well as interest and costs, these are valid but not insurmountable. Absent any submissions from parties, the Court can simply (and unobjectionably) prorate the apportionment under the various heads of claim. To take a straightforward example, if the District Court assesses general damages at $150,000 and special damages at $150,000, the final award would be $125,000 for general damages and $125,000 for special damages. This prorating exercise can be as granular as the case requires, extending to the various heads of general and special damages where necessary.

27     Fourth, the Plaintiff had, in her written submissions, referred to several District Court decisions which purportedly adopted this interpretation:[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)_Sharma Gautam v Soh Cheow Tiong_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 175</span> (“_Sharma_”); _Krishnamoorthy S/O Chellappan v Ramasamy Arivazhagan_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 283</span>; _Chua Hong Keng v Poh Tiong Choon Logistics Limited and another_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 94</span>; _Woon Hok Fah v Zheng Xiaohua and another_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 55</span>; and _Mutyalu Eswarudu v Lucky Joint Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 202</span>. None of these decisions directly addressed the present issue. Indeed, none of them expressly mentioned s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 and the last two did not even mention any issue of jurisdiction. That said, there is perhaps some implicit acceptance of this interpretation in _Sharma_, where the District Judge, after totalling the plaintiff’s claim at $686,019.11, and before _proceeding_ with the rest of her decision, observed (at \[8\]) that:

> As the parties had not signed any memorandum under s 23 State Courts Act, counsel for the Plaintiff _informed me_ that any award made by the Court would be limited to the District Court limit of $250,000.00 as laid down in _Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd v Ng Chan Teng_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGCA 12</span>. \[emphasis added\]

28     Fifth, and finally, it has come to my attention that the decision in Jeyakumar was actually successfully appealed against in Registrar’s Appeal No 64 of 2021. Parties were probably unaware of this since no written decision was published in the appeal. It appears that the appeal was allowed because, notwithstanding his arguments before the Deputy Registrar (see \[21\] above), the plaintiff’s counsel had, in fact, orally represented to the Court at the start of the assessment hearing that the plaintiff would be limiting his claim to $250,000.

29     For the reasons set out at \[23\]–\[28\] above, and in answer to the first issue, I was of the view that it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000.

### The second issue: “the amount claimed”

30     The second issue was whether “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis or the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account.

31     Section 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 presently states as follows:

> (4)    Subject to sections 22 and 23, a District Court’s jurisdiction under subsection (2) does not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where —

>> (_a_)    the amount claimed in the action exceeds the District Court limit; or

>> (_b_)    any remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.

32     The “District Court limit” is defined in s 2 of the State Courts Act 1970. For all intents and purposes, this is currently $250,000. As for ss 22 and 23 of the State Courts Act 1970, these set out two exceptions to this $250,000 limit. The former is the subject of the first issue discussed above, while the latter allows parties to agree to enlarge the District Court’s jurisdiction by signing a memorandum. But as alluded to previously (see \[6\] above), it was not an available option in the present case.

33     The analysis of the second issue must start with _Keppel_. In _Keppel_, the Court of Appeal held (at \[20\]) that any reduction for contributory negligence ought to be made from the _actual damages assessed_ and not from the District Court limit. However, while this superficially appears to provide a direct (and, indeed, binding) answer to the second issue, the Court of Appeal was, in actual fact, interpreting a differently worded provision. The provision in question in _Keppel_ was s 20 (and, in particular, s 20(1)(_a_)) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed), which provided as follows:

> **Jurisdiction in actions of contract and tort**

> **20.**—(1)    A District Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and try any action founded on contract or tort where —

>> (_a_)    the debt, demand or damage claimed does not exceed the District Court limit, _whether on balance of account or otherwise_; or

>> (_b_)    there is no claim for money, and the remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject-matter the value of which does not exceed the District Court limit.

> (2)    A District Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and try any action where the debt or demand claimed consists of a balance not exceeding the District Court limit after a set-off of any debt or demand claimed or recoverable by the defendant from the plaintiff, being a set-off admitted by the plaintiff in the particulars of his claim or demand.

> \[emphasis added\]

34     Of course, a mere difference in wording does not, by itself, render the legal position in _Keppel_ no longer applicable. However, what is critical to the present analysis is how the Court of Appeal’s discussion at \[20\]-\[30\] of _Keppel_ focused predominantly on the phrase “whether on balance of account or otherwise” in s 20(1)(_a_) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed). Indeed, the Court of Appeal observed (at \[26\]) that “the disposal of \[the\] appeal rest\[ed\]” on whether the term “or otherwise” should be interpreted _ejusdem generis_ (such that it only covered matters involving contract) or given its natural meaning (such that it would also cover instances where a plaintiff was contributory negligent). Ultimately, the Court of Appeal concluded (at \[29\]) that the words “or otherwise” were wide enough to include a situation where reduction of the damages awarded was to be made as a result of a plaintiff’s contributory negligence, and that any such reduction should operate on the damages actually assessed and not on the District Court limit.

35     But herein lies the crux: the phrase “whether on balance of account or otherwise” _does not appear_ in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the legal position in _Keppel_ is no longer applicable and the second issue must be considered afresh. I should also add that the two District Court decisions cited by the Plaintiff[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) – _Sharma_ and _Corwin Holding Pte Ltd v Dragon’s Nail, Foot & Body Massage Place Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 108</span> – do not detract from this because the present issue was before neither District Court.

36     In my view, “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis, and not the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account.

37     First, as its plain wording indicates, s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 is a provision dealing with the District Court’s jurisdiction, and this interpretation is more consistent with the concept of jurisdiction. Five years after _Keppel_, the Court of Appeal in _Re Nalpon Zero Geraldo Mario_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 258</span> clarified (at \[32\]) that the jurisdiction of a Court and the powers of a Court are two distinct and entirely different concepts. Specifically, the Court of Appeal affirmed (at \[31\]) the distinction drawn by the High Court in _Muhd Munir v Noor Hidah_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 348</span> (at \[19\]) between the jurisdiction and the powers of a Court: the jurisdiction of a Court is “its authority, however derived, to hear and determine a dispute that is brought before it”, while the powers of a Court “constitute its capacity to give effect to its determination by making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party to the dispute”.

38     Because the jurisdiction of a Court is its authority to “_hear_ and determine a dispute that is brought before it” \[emphasis added\], it stands to reason that jurisdiction is something that must be determined _at the outset_: the Court must be satisfied that it _has jurisdiction_ before it can proceed to _hear_ a matter. And at the outset, only the amount claimed on a 100% basis can be quantified; the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account cannot. Moreover, if jurisdiction were not determined at the outset, the Court would effectively be hearing a dispute without knowing whether it has jurisdiction. This would be unsatisfactory: jurisdiction is something the Court either has or does not have; it is not something that should be left indeterminate until the extent of contributory negligence is determined. Accordingly, interpreting “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 as referring to the amount claimed on a 100% basis is more consistent with the concept of jurisdiction.

39     In contrast, an interpretation based on the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account would be more consistent with the concept of powers, since the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account is really an invitation to the Court to give effect to its determination, at the end of proceedings, by “making or granting the orders or reliefs sought by the successful party to the dispute”. This is evident from how, in practice, the Court will often first assess damages on a 100% basis; it is only at the end of the analysis and before making the final award that the Court will apply the relevant deduction to take contributory negligence into account. However, s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 is not a provision dealing with the District Court’s powers; these are instead governed by ss 31 and 32 of the State Courts Act 1970.

40     Second, interpreting “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 as referring to the amount claimed on a 100% basis ensures coherence with the operation of paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016. These paragraphs essentially provide that certain motor accident and industrial accident proceedings commenced in the High Court/General Division of the High Court are transferred for hearing and determination in the District Court “where _the amount claimed_ in the action does not exceed $500,000” \[emphasis added\]. As the Defendant submitted, these transfers take place shortly after the claim is filed and before liability is determined.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) Indeed, I understand that these transfers take place automatically once the claim is filed. Again, at that stage, only the amount claimed on a 100% basis can be quantified; the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account cannot. Thus, for the purposes of paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016, “the amount claimed” must refer to the amount claimed on a 100% basis. I should also add that this interpretive tool was not available to the Court of Appeal in _Keppel_, since the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016 was only promulgated more than eight years after _Keppel_.

41     The analysis can be taken yet a step further. Paragraphs 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016 are in fact provisions dealing with _jurisdiction_: para 3 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016 provides that “a District Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine any proceedings mentioned in para 2 or 2A, even though the amount involved in those proceedings exceeds the monetary limit of the ordinary jurisdiction of a District Court”. Since the transfers under paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016 occur at the commencement of proceedings, this further reinforces the point made at \[37\] above that jurisdiction is something that must be determined at the outset.

42     Third, interpreting “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 as referring to the amount claimed on a 100% basis conduces to certainty. At the point an action is commenced, it is simply not possible for a claimant to know how liability will be apportioned pursuant to any contributory negligence.

43     This point was in fact alluded to in _Keppel_. By the time the appeal in _Keppel_ reached the Court of Appeal, the first instance decision of the Deputy Registrar had already gone through two rounds of appeal: the first before a District Judge and the second before a High Court Judge. In setting out the decisions below, the Court of Appeal quoted (at \[8\]) the District Judge’s reasoning in _Ng Chan Teng v Keppel Singmarine Dockyard Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 213</span> (at \[7\]) as follows:

> After careful consideration, I found myself in broad agreement with the submissions of the Defendant \[_ie_, the appellant\]. Like the Deputy Registrar, I was of the view that the language of Section 20 \[of the Act\] is plain and obvious, and the answer was clear. As the District Court limit is set at $250,000, 70% of $250,000 must mean that the Plaintiff’s \[_ie_, the respondent’s\] claim is now limited to $175,000. _In my view, to adopt the Plaintiff’s interpretation would lead to uncertainty as to whether such civil claims ought to be commenced in the High Court or \[the\] District Court. The issue of contributory negligence was something that could not be accurately determined at the outset._ Adopting the Plaintiff’s interpretation would also mean potentially that claims of up to $25 million could well commence in the District Court assuming that the Court ultimately finds the Defendant to be 1% liable. In my view, this would not be logical. \[emphasis added\]

44     The Court of Appeal did not appear to address this point in the rest of its decision. This is perhaps understandable given the focus on the phrase “whether on balance of account or otherwise” (see \[33\] above). But since the phrase “whether on balance of account or otherwise” does not appear in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970, this point once again assumes significance.

45     Fourth, the competing interpretation (_ie_, interpreting “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 as referring to the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account) leads to curious consequences. As the Defendant alluded to in its written submissions, a claimant in a case where liability is resolved separately from quantum will be allowed to bring before the District Court a claim which, on a 100% basis, exceeds $250,000, as long liability is not ultimately resolved on a 100% basis.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) In contrast, a claimant in a case where liability is not resolved separately from quantum will not be allowed to do so.[^18] On the other side of the equation, a defendant in a case where liability is resolved separately from quantum is left open to a potentially larger award than a defendant in a case where liability is not resolved separately from quantum.[^19]

46     There is no principled basis for these distinctions. This is furthermore compounded by how the issue of whether liability is resolved separately from quantum can, in some cases, be a wholly fortuitous matter (_eg_, whether parties decide to apply for bifurcation). I therefore agree with the Defendant that the words “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 should consistently refer to the amount claimed on a 100% basis, and should not bear a different meaning depending on whether liability has been resolved.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

47     Fifth, the repeal of s 20 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) does not shed any definitive light on Parliament’s intent vis-à-vis s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970, and therefore does not affect the above analysis.

48     Section 20 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) was repealed by s 3 of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Act 2010. From the Second Reading speech of the Subordinate Courts (Amendment) Bill (Bill No 26/2010), it appears that this was done to allow the District Court and the Magistrates’ Court to hear all types of actions and remedies, subject only to their respective monetary limits. This was in contrast to the previous position, where the District Court and Magistrates’ Court could only hear claims in contract and tort and certain types of actions in equity (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 October 2010) vol 87 at col 1396 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs)).

49     In other words, there is, admittedly, no indication that Parliament had intended to legislatively overrule _Keppel_. However, in my view, this is neither here nor there. Parliament may not have intended to legislatively overrule _Keppel_, but there is equally no indication that Parliament had intended to maintain the legal position in _Keppel_. The fact remains that the phrase “whether on balance of account or otherwise” in s 20(1)(_a_) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) no longer appears in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970. If Parliament had intended to maintain the legal position in _Keppel_, it would have been a simple matter for Parliament to transpose the phrase over to s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970. This is especially so given the Court of Appeal’s holding in _Keppel_ that the term “or otherwise” was _not_ to be interpreted such that it only covered matters involving contract (see \[33\] above); the retention of the phrase would therefore have posed no difficulty if Parliament was indeed minded to maintain the legal position in _Keppel_.

50     If anything, the Second Reading speech lends yet further support to the point made at \[37\] above that jurisdiction is something that must be determined at the outset. As the Defendant pointed out,[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) it was observed that the amendments to the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) would make it easier for a litigant to know where to _file his claim_ (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (18 October 2010) vol 87 at col 1397 (Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Law and Ministry of Home Affairs)):

> Sir, with these amendments in place, a litigant who wishes to commence an action will no longer need to be concerned with the legal nature of his dispute when deciding in which Court – that is the High Court, District Court or Magistrates’ Court – to _file his claim_. Instead, the main determining factor would be the value of his claim. This is more straightforward and efficient. \[emphasis added\]

51     This observation also answers the concern, alluded to by Ms Hendrick at the hearing, that for certain actions (such as the present suit), the claim, at the commencement of proceedings, is for an unliquidated sum. While it is true that precise quantification of the claim may not be possible at the commencement of proceedings, the fact is that a claimant must have _some_ idea of what the amount claimed is. Otherwise, how else will he know which Court he should file his claim in? Indeed, this point is further reinforced by how paras 2 and 2A of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Transfer of Specified Proceedings to District Court) Order 2016 operate in practice (see \[39\] above).

52     Sixth, and finally, I deal with a point made in _Keppel_ and raised by the Plaintiff in her written submissions.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) This relates to s 3(3) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953. This provides as follows:

> **Apportionment of liability in case of contributory negligence**

> **3.**—(1)    Where any person suffers damage as the result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, a claim in respect of that damage shall not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage, but the damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.

> …

> (3)    Where any contract or written law providing for the limitation of liability is applicable to the claim, the amount of damages recoverable by the claimant under subsection (1) shall not exceed the maximum limit so applicable.

> …

53     In _Keppel_, the Court of Appeal held (at \[30\]) that its holding (at \[29\]) (_ie_, that the words “or otherwise” were wide enough to include a situation where reduction of the damages awarded was to be made as a result of a plaintiff’s contributory negligence, and that any such reduction should operate on the damages actually assessed and not on the District Court limit) “would also be consonant” with this provision. The Court of Appeal observed (at \[30\]) that this provision meant that if a defendant’s liability was limited by _contract or written law_, any reduction for contributory negligence would operate on the total assessed damages and not on the limits imposed by contract or statute. In these circumstances, the Court of Appeal reasoned that the Courts ought not to take a diametrically opposite (and illogical) approach by making reductions for contributory negligence from the District Court limit if the defendant’s liability was limited by the Court’s _jurisdictional limit_ instead.

54     There is considerable force in this argument. However, I do not read this as forming the basis of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Keppel_. As mentioned at \[33\] above, _Keppel_ fundamentally and ultimately turned on whether the term “or otherwise” in s 20(1)(_a_) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) should be interpreted _ejusdem generis_ or given its natural meaning. As I see it, the Court of Appeal was merely analogising from s 3(3) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 and using this analogy as _additional_ support for its conclusion. Indeed, s 3(3) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 _could not have_ formed the basis of the Court of Appeal’s decision because, as it deals with the limitation of liability pursuant to _contract or written law_, it was simply not directly applicable. For these reasons, I am of the view that s 3(3) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act 1953 is just one other factor to be considered in the round. And in my assessment, it does not, by itself, tilt the balance in favour of the competing interpretation.

55     For the reasons set out at \[36\]–\[53\] above, and in answer to the second issue, I was of the view that “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis, and not the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account.

## Conclusion

56     Returning to the two issues identified at \[11\] above, I was of the view that:

> (a)     it suffices, for the purposes of s 22(1) of the State Courts Act 1970, for a claimant to cap his claim at $250,000; and

> (b)     “the amount claimed” in s 19(4) of the State Courts Act 1970 refers to the amount claimed on a 100% basis, and not the amount claimed after taking contributory negligence into account.

57     The corollary was that, unless the Plaintiff was willing to cap her claim at $125,000, I did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the assessment of damages. I therefore directed that both Ms Hendrick and Mr Ramesh take their respective clients’ instructions on how they each intended to move forward with the assessment of damages.
