Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Drug offences – Trafficking, Consumption and Possession

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9016/2021/01.\]

25 February 2021

### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused. The Accused had pleaded guilty on 15 January 2021 to four drug-related charges. He also admitted and consented to six other drug-related charges and one charge in relation to obstruction of the course of justice under section 204A of the Penal Code (Cap 184 Rev Ed 2008) to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

2       I sentenced the Accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="21.42%"> <col width="60.72%"> <col width="17.86%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-912642-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Trafficking of a Class A controlled drug by having in possession for the purpose of trafficking 35 packets containing not less than 7.26 grams of diamorphine, an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) and punishable under Section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 years and 3 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-920704-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession a Class A controlled drug, to wit, 21 packets and 9 straws containing not less than 4.13 grams of diamorphine, an offence under section 8(a) and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-920707-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption of a specified drug, to wit, morphine, an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and by virtue of one previous admission to Drug Rehabilitation Centre and one previous court conviction, punishable under section 33A(1) of the MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-920709-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession utensils intended to be used for the consumption of controlled drug, under section 9 and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

3       I ordered the sentence of imprisonment for the offence of trafficking to run consecutively together with the sentence for the offence of possession of a controlled drug, giving a total sentence of 10 years and 3 months’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence has filed a notice of appeal against sentence. The sentence was backdated to the date of his first day of remand, 15 February 2020. As at the time of the writing of these grounds of decision, the Accused is still serving his sentence.

5       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

## THE STATEMENT OF FACTS

6       The Accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution.

7       I set out briefly the facts contained therein.

8       The Accused is Spencer Kelly Vincent, a 59-year-old male Singaporean (D.O.B: 1 March 1961).

### Details of the arrest of the Accused

9       On 13 February 2020, at or about 12.57pm, the Accused was arrested at Blk 310C Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 #XXX (the “**Unit**”), Singapore, for trafficking of a controlled drug and consumption of a specified drug.

10     Prior to the arrest, police officers on the ground floor saw the Accused throwing items out from the kitchen window of the Unit. The police officers conducted a search of the premises and various drug items including plastic bags containing granular substances were recovered from the kitchen parapet of the Unit and one improvised glass bottle with a tube attached and one rolled up paper and a stained aluminium foil from the kitchen floor.

11     A search was conducted on the Accused and 2 straws of granular/powdery substances were also found on him. The Accused was brought to the 25th level of the same block and one packet of granular/powdery substances was recovered. He was then brought to the 20th level of the same block where one black pouch containing 6 straws of granular/powdery substance was recovered.

### Facts pertaining to the 1st Charge (DAC 912642-2020)

12     Upon submission of the drug exhibits seized to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis, HSA analysts had issued certificates under section 16 of the MDA stating that 35 exhibits were found to contain not less than 266.66 grams of granular or powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 7.26 grams of Diamorphine.

13     Diamorphine is Class A controlled drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

14     The Accused admitted to the ownership of the said 35 exhibits and having them in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, and that he would have sold each of the said 35 exhibits for $120. The Accused further admitted that he has been selling diamorphine to sustain his drug addiction.

15     The Accused thus did traffic in a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the MDA, by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking 35 packets containing not less than 266.66 grams of granular powdery substances which was analysed and found to contain not less than 7.26 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. The Accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the MDA punishable under Section 33(1) of the MDA.

### Facts pertaining to the 5th Charge (DAC 920704-2020)

16     HSA also issued certificates under section 16 of the MDA stating that 24 exhibits were found to contain not less than 163.94 grams of granular or powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 4.13 grams of Diamorphine.

17     The Accused admitted to ownership of the said 24 exhibits comprising 21 packets and 9 straws and that he had them in his possession for his own consumption.

18     The Accused thus did have in his possession a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA, 21 packets and 9 straws containing not less than 163.94 grams of granular or powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 4.13 grams of Diamorphine, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

19     The Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA punishable under section 33(1) read with the Second Schedule to the MDA.

### Facts pertaining to the 8th Charge (DAC 920707-2020)

20     On 13th February 2020, at the CNB office located in Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters, the Accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed in his presence.

21     On 14 February 2020, the said urine samples were submitted to the HSA for analysis. On 18th February 2020, HSA issued 2 certificates, dated 18 February 2020, under Section 16 of the MDA, stating that on analysis the urine samples were found to contain morphine.

22     Morphine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

23     The Accused admitted that he consumed heroin, which is the street name for diamorphine, twice on 13 February 2020, once at or around 5am and the second time at or around 7.30am.

24     The Accused did consume a specified drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA, morphine, without authorization under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. The Accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

25     Further, the Accused, before the commission of the said offence, was on 12 July 2000, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under s 37(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 1985 Rev Ed), admitted to an approved institution, namely, Drug Rehabilitation Centre, for consumption of a specified drug, morphine, which is a previous admission by virtue of Section 33A(5)(c)(ii) of the MDA, and was on 20 June 2002 in Subordinate Court No. 26, vide DAC/30334/2002, convicted of an offence for consumption of a controlled drug, cannabinol derivatives, under s 8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed) and sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, which conviction has not been set aside to date and is deemed to be a previous conviction by virtue of s 33A(5)(a)(i) of the MDA. The Accused is therefore punishable under s 33A(1) of the MDA.

### Facts pertaining to the 10th Charge (DAC 920709-2020)

26     The Accused admitted to the ownership and possession of the exhibit of one improvised glass bottle marked as “B1D” and the exhibit of one rolled up paper and stained aluminium foil marked as “B1E”.

27     The Accused has further admitted that he had used exhibit “B1D” to consume Ice, which is the street name for methamphetamine, and the rolled-up paper and stained aluminium foil to consume heroin, which is the street name for diamorphine.

28     Diamorphine and methamphetamine are Class ‘A’ Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

29     The Accused thus did have in his possession utensils intended to be used for the consumption of controlled drug, “B1D” and “B1E”, without any authorization under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. The Accused has thereby committed an offence under section 9 and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

## ANTECEDENTS

30     The Accused’s previous convictions comprised the conviction for consumption of controlled drug mentioned at \[25\] above as well as three convictions for failure to attend urine test which are for an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations. He was given a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment with two of such sentences to run consecutively with the consumption sentence, giving a total of 30 months’ imprisonment.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

31     The Prosecution submitted that relying on the guideline bands of sentences based on 7.26 grams of diamorphine trafficked laid down in the case of _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”), the starting indicative range would be 8-9 years’ imprisonment. As there were 3 other trafficking offences taken into consideration and the fact that the Accused was not a first-time drug offender, Prosecution submitted for an uplift of 4 months to 8 years and 4 months’ imprisonment.

32     As for the offence of possession, Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. This is based on the amount of drugs involved – 4.13 grams of diamorphine, after comparing with precedent cases. This is also to take into account of the fact that the Accused had 2 other possession of controlled drug charges taken into consideration.

33     Prosecution submitted for the minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment for the consumption charge and for a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for the possession of drug utensils offence.

34     The Prosecution asked for the sentence for the trafficking offence to run consecutively with the sentence for possession of controlled drug, giving a total sentence of 10 years and 10 months’ imprisonment. They submitted that this would be more appropriate than to run the trafficking offence sentence with the sentence for possession of drug utensils for the following reasons:

> (i)     There was a total of 3 other trafficking charges taken into consideration which involved the selling of drugs to two different individuals;

> (ii)     The Accused had tried to dispose of the drug exhibits as evidenced by one charge under section 204 of the Penal Code being taken into consideration; and

> (iii)     The Accused has relevant drug antecedents.

## MITIGATION

35     The crux of the mitigation is mainly on compassionate grounds that the Accused was 59 years old, going on to 60 and hence would not have much time left if a long sentence is imposed. He had lost his family as his wife and children are in the Philippines and his wife has decided not to return to Singapore upon hearing of his arrest.

36     The Defence Counsel also asserted that the Accused was able to abstain from drugs for 16 years but went back to drugs during the stressful period he was undergoing. He had fallen into unemployment for the last 5 years and was unable to pay his mortgage on his HDB flat resulting in it being foreclosed by the bank. Since 2017 he had been living in the parks, under the highways and occasionally at his sister’s home. When he fell into drugs, he had to sell drugs in order to sustain himself.

37     Finally, the Defence Counsel agreed with the sentence submitted by Prosecution for the trafficking offence of 8 years and 4 months but asked instead for this sentence to run consecutively with the sentence for the possession of drug utensils giving a total of 8 years and 7 months’ imprisonment.

38     The Defence Counsel submitted that the sentence for the trafficking should not run consecutively with the sentence for the possession of controlled drug since all the drugs were found together on one occasion.

## THE COURT’S DECISION ON SENTENCE

### Sentencing for the trafficking offence

39     In Vasentha, the sentencing approach laid down is to first determine the indicative starting points, based on the quantity of diamorphine, and thereafter to adjust these starting points based on the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

40     Applying this principle, I found that the starting point based on the amount trafficked of 7.23 grams of diamorphine would be about 8 years and 2 months. The sentencing band for 7-8 grams has been set at 8-9 years with 8-9 strokes of the cane (see Vasentha at \[47\]).

41     Moving onto the culpability level of the Accused, in Vasentha, one of the factors indicating a higher culpability is being motivated by “financial or other advantage, whether operating as part of a drug syndicate or alone (e.g. to sustain offender’s own drug habits)” (at \[51\]) (my emphasis).

42     In the present case, it has been admitted by the Accused that he was trafficking in drugs to sustain his drug addiction (see \[14\] above).

43     Moving onto the aggravating factors to determine whether further adjustments are needed, amongst the list of 5 indicators set out in Vasentha (at \[54\]), two are relevant to the present case:

> (i)     offences taken into consideration and the offender’s involvement in other offences; and

> (ii)     attempt to conceal or dispose of evidence of the offence.

44     The Accused had three other trafficking charges taken into consideration in which he had sold drugs to two individuals. From these charges, it is also noted that the Accused was dealing with two kinds of drugs, diamorphine and methamphetamine.

45     The Accused also had a charge for the obstructing the course of justice taken into consideration. The Accused had thrown a blue pouch and a black pouch which contained controlled drugs, diamorphine and methamphetamine, out of the Unit’s window with the intention of disposing them to obstruct the course of justice.

46     On the other hand, there was no significant mitigating factors present. His plea of guilt would not garner much mitigatory weight given that he was caught red-handed by the CNB officers and all the drugs were found in the Unit when he was arrested in the Unit. He was also seen by CNB officers to be throwing something out of the kitchen of the Unit.

47     Accordingly, I am of the view that a significant upward adjustment is warranted and an appropriate sentence would be in the region of 9 years’ imprisonment, subject to any further adjustment when the global sentence is considered.

### Sentencing for the possession of controlled drug offence

48     For the possession of controlled drug charge, the amount involved is a significant amount 4.13 grams of diamorphine. In the sentencing precedents tendered by Prosecution, there were 3 precedents for possession of diamorphine where the offender has pleaded guilty. Just based purely on the weight of diamorphine the sentences meted out were as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="54.0691861627675%"> <col width="21.995600879824%"> <col width="23.9352129574085%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1"><b>Case Name</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1"><b>Weight of the diamorphine</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1"><em>PP v Hassan bin Ali</em></p><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">SC-910900-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1">0.24 g</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1">9 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1"><em>PP v Mohamed Farzan bin Abd Karim</em></p><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">SC-908627-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1">2.83 g</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1">18 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1"><em>PP v Nurzilla binte Gani</em></p><p align="justify" class="QuoteList-Table-1">SC-902146-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1">2.92 g</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="QuoteList-Table-1">19 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

49     The Prosecution further submitted that 2 other cases involving possession of methamphetamine would also provide useful sentencing precedents by using the arithmetic formula of 1 gram of diamorphine to 16.7 grams of methamphetamine as applied in the case of _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span> for the trafficking of methamphetamine.

50     The 2 cases and their equivalent weight in diamorphine based on such a formula would be as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.625925185037%"> <col width="28.8657731546309%"> <col width="24.8449689937988%"> <col width="16.6633326665333%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Name of case</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Weight of methamphetamine</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Converted to weight of diamorphine</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>PP v Muhammad Nasir bin Anwar</em></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">SC-910571-2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">65.52 g</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3.92 g</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>PP v Abdullah Halimi bin Rahmat</em></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">SC-900425-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">67.56 g</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4.05 g</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

51     Undoubtedly, an important factor in calibrating the sentence for a possession of controlled drug offence would be the amount of controlled drugs found in the Accused’s possession. However, the High Court in the case of Liew Zheng Yang v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1160</span> (at \[12-16\]) while accepting that a large quantity of drugs would be an aggravating factor, had expressly held that a “multiple starting points” approach is unsuitable for the offence of drug possession. Instead the Court had approached sentencing by examining the aggravating and mitigating factors which are relevant to the charge of possession while keeping in mind the existing sentencing precedents.

52     Applying the same approach, I found that in the present case, 4.13 grams of diamorphine is indeed of a relatively large amount, which is 1.2 grams heavier than in the case of Nurzilla. This would warrant a significant uplift to the sentence of 19 months imposed in Nurzilla. I found Prosecution’s postulation regarding the conversion formula used in trafficking case set out in \[50\] is helpful although should not be applied rigidly.

53     As for the other relevant factors, I considered that the Accused was clearly not a young offender and he was in possession of more than one type of controlled drug. I thus found overall, an uplift to the sentence is warranted compared to the sentence imposed in Nurzilla and would be closer to the sentences imposed in the sentencing precedents in \[50\] above of around 28 months’ imprisonment.

### Sentencing for the offences of drug consumption and possession of drug utensils

54     There is no need to elaborate on the sentence for the consumption offence as the minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment had been imposed.

55     As for the offence of possession of drug utensils, Prosecution has submitted for 3 months’ imprisonment and Defence Counsel did not dispute that this is an appropriate sentence. I have accordingly imposed 3 months’ imprisonment for this offence.

### Ordering of consecutive sentences

56     I will now address the issue of the global sentence. By the operation of section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 68 Revised Ed 2012, at least 2 of the imprisonment terms would have to run consecutively where three or more terms of imprisonment had been passed at one trial.

57     In _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>, the High Court had held that the sentencing judge in deciding which sentences are to run consecutively is to consider the one-transaction rule which is to run concurrently for those offences committed in a single transaction. The second principle the sentencing judge should consider is the totality principle which is to ensure that the global sentence should be restrained by the principle of proportionality.

58     Applying these two principles, I found that all the offences committed, save for the possession of drug utensils, were distinct offences and involve the protection of different legal interests. As such, the only two sentences which ought to be run concurrently would be that of possession of drug utensils and that for consumption since these utensils were intended to be used for his consumption of the drugs.

59     Moving onto to the totality principle, I found that based on the overall culpability of the Accused, where he had committed numerous offences with several charges for trafficking and possession taken into consideration, it would be appropriate to run the sentence for the offence of trafficking consecutively with the sentence for the offence of possession of controlled drug.

60     Running the sentence for consumption of minimum 5 years’ imprisonment consecutively with that for trafficking would be unduly harsh as that would result in a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment. On the other hand, running the sentence for trafficking with that of possession of drug utensils would be manifestly inadequate considering the overall culpability of the Accused.

61     If I were to run the 2 sentences for trafficking and possession consecutively, the global sentence would be 11 years and 4 months. In my view that would be slightly on the harsh side considering that the Accused is about to reach 60 years old and accordingly I have calibrated the sentence downwards. For the trafficking offence, which I have earlier indicated at \[47\] above to be a sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment, I have brought it down to 8 years and 3 months’ imprisonment. For the possession of controlled drug charge, I have brought it down from the earlier indication of 28 months as set out at \[53\] above to a sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment.

## CONCLUSION

62     For the aforesaid reasons, I have sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 10 years and 3 months’ imprisonment to take into account the quantity of drugs involved and his overall culpability as reflected in a total of 11 charges faced by him.
