### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused was convicted, after trial, on one count of trafficking in not less than 9.48 grams of diamorphine, a Class A controlled drug, on 14 Jul 17 at about 5.05 pm (DAC 944922/17). The Accused had given one Shahrizal Bin Abdul Rahman (“Shahrizal”) a packet of heroin along Upper Bedok Road near the junction of Bedok Lane.

2       After the conviction, he pleaded guilty to one count of possession of not less than 15.12 grams of methamphetamine (DAC 944951/17), and one count of consumption of methamphetamine (DAC 944954/17). Methamphetamine was a Class A controlled drug. One count of possession of cannabis mixture (DAC 944952/17) and one count of possession of drug taking utensils (DAC 944953/17) were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       After hearing the submissions on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation, I sentenced the Accused as follows –

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="0"><colgroup><col width="36.04%"> <col width="63.96%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 944922/17</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 944951/17</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 months’ imprisonment.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 944954/17</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 months’ imprisonment.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

The sentences in DAC 944922/17 and DAC 944954/17 were ordered to run consecutively, making the total aggregate sentence 15 years’ and 15 months’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane.

4       The Accused has lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence.

## THE UNDISPUTED FACTS

5       On 14 Jul 17, at about 5.00 pm, the Accused was seen walking out of house unit no. 242, Bedok Road (“No. 242”). He walked along Bedok Road in the direction of Simpang Bedok. He wore black clothes and carried a black sling bag. From Bedok Road, he walked into Upper Bedok Road[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). At Upper Bedok Road, he met with Shahrizal near the T-junction of Upper Bedok Road and Bedok Lane[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). The Accused arrived at the location first. Shahrizal arrived riding his Yamaha motor-cycle soon after. What transpired during this brief meeting between them became the main point of contention in the trial.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

6       The prosecution’s case was that the meeting was pre-arranged between the Accused and Sharizal. Its purpose was for Shahrizal to take delivery of a packet of heroin from the Accused. The Accused had the packet of heroin in his black sling bag. Shahrizal then paid $3000/- in cash to the Accused for the heroin. After the drug transaction had taken place, Shahrizal rode away on his motorcycle. Unknown to both of them, CNB officers were in the vicinity conducting surveillance. Shahrizal was followed and subsequently arrested not far away. The packet of heroin and some cash were found inside a food warmer bag which was placed inside a green basket[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). The green basket was in turn secured on the seat of Shahrizal’s motorcycle.

7       Subsequently, sometime after 9.00 pm that same night, CNB officers raided No. 242. The Accused who was then in the house was placed under arrest. His bedroom was searched. They seized a quantity of cannabis mixture, a quantity of methamphetamine and a smoking pipe made from glass used for drug taking. The controlled drugs and the drug-taking implement formed the subject-matter of the charges to which he pleaded guilty to after the trial. This would be dealt with in the later part of the Grounds of Decision.

8       The packet of heroin which the Accused had given to Shahrizal along Upper Bedok Road was analysed and found to contain not less than 9.48 grams of diamorphine[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4). Diamorphine was a Class A controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185. The Accused was not authorised to give the diamorphine to Shahrizal.

## THE DEFENCE’S CASE

9       The Accused’s version of what transpired during the brief meeting was diametrically opposite to that of the prosecution’s. He alleged that the meeting was for Shahrizal to pay back a loan to him. The Accused had arrived first at the agreed location. Shortly thereafter, Shahrizal arrived on his motorcycle. Secured on the motorcycle seat behind him was a green basket with the food warmer bag inside it[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). As the Accused was in a hurry, he had asked Shahrizal where the money was. Without moving from the motorcycle seat, Shahrizal had pointed to the food warmer bag.

10     The Accused then looked inside the food warmer bag. He saw an envelope in the bag. He took the envelope, opened it but did not find any money inside. He put the envelope back in the food warmer bag. The Accused asked him again about the money. Shahrizal turned around, picked up a plastic bag from the side of the green basket and handed it to him. The Accused saw money inside the plastic bag. In addition to the money, the Accused claimed that Shahrizal had also given him some methamphetamine as a sample for him to try. They then left the place separately. The Accused claimed that he had taken a train at the Tanah Merah MRT station to a restaurant at Raffles Place.

11     The Accused returned to No. 242 sometime after 9.00 pm. Shortly thereafter, CNB officers raided the house. His bedroom which was on the first floor was searched. The sample of methamphetamine which he had obtained from Shahrizal earlier that day was seized together with a smoking pipe made of glass. A quantity of cannabis mixture was also seized from behind a cupboard.

## ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE

12     The whole case turned on the evidence of Shahrizal on what transpired during his meeting with the Accused. None of the CNB officers who were at the vicinity was able to definitively see what had actually transpired. This was because the location where the transaction had taken place made it impossible for them to get close enough to conduct observation without being discovered or arousing suspicion.

### Shahrizal’s Evidence

13     As background, at the time of his arrest, Shahrizal was a part-time UberEats food delivery rider. He had started doing this since early 2017. He earned a maximum of about $600 to $700 a month. He also earned extra money from delivering orders for an online catering company. For this work, he was paid $90 per delivery. Prior to working with UberEats, he was a crane operator from 2013 to 2016 earning $7000 to $8000 a month. This was inclusive of overtime pay.

14     Shahrizal confessed to be a long time heroin consumer. He had only started consuming methamphetamine in early 2017. Apart from being a consumer, Shahrizal had also dabbled in trafficking in heroin. In fact, at the time of his oral testimony, he was serving sentence for trafficking, possession and consumption offences involving heroin. In particular, the trafficking offence was committed on 14 July 17. He explained that he bought the heroin in packets weighing 450 grams each. Each 450 grams packet was referred to as one “batu” (Malay for stone or rock). Each “batu” cost about $3000/-. He would repack the one “batu” into smaller eight gram sachets to sell. From one “batu” of heroin, he was able to get about 50 smaller sachets. He did the repacking himself usually in cubicles of selected public toilets at malls and the Singapore Expo. These were those which were usually deserted and quiet. He charged $100/- for each sachet, but offered a discounted deal of $700/- for a bulk purchase of 10 sachets. He stored the heroin, a weighing scale, and the sachets inside a paper bag. The paper bag was then placed inside the food warmer bag. He claimed that his drug supplier was a male known to him as “Din”. According to Shahrizal, Din would call him regarding the sale and purchase of drugs. He claimed he had never called Din in relation to the sale and purchase of drugs, as Din had warned him against doing so. Instead Din would call him once a week to set up the drug transaction. Prior to his arrest on 14 Jul 17, he had purchased heroin from Din on two occasions. The exchanges had taken place in the vicinity of the Simpang Bedok area, which was near to Bedok Lane and Upper Bedok Road.

15     In court, Shahrizal testified that he had gone to the meeting place on his motorcycle. He said Din was already there waiting for him. He testified that Din was wearing a white T-shirt and black pants. Din then passed him the one “batu” of heroin. He took the heroin and placed it inside his motorcycle box. He then took $3000/- from his pocket and gave it to Din. He claimed that Din did not take or put anything in the green basket. The critical part of his evidence in court was that he did not identify the Accused to be Din. He claimed that Din was not present in the courtroom. When pressed to describe Din, he said Din was dark skinned, of average height, quite plum, and probably an Indian Muslim. Shahrizal also confirmed that Din was the only person he had met at Upper Bedok Road on 14 Jul 17[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6).

16     As Shahrizal was obviously a ‘hostile’ witness, the prosecution applied under s 156 of the Evidence Act for leave to cross-examine him on the basis of three prior statements which he had made to CNB, which were materially inconsistent with his oral testimony in court. These were – (i) a contemporaneous statement recorded immediate after his arrest on 14 Jul 17 (“P14”); (ii) a statement under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68 (“CPC”) dated 19 Jul 17 (“P15”); and (iii) a further statement recorded under s 22 CPC dated 20 Jul 17 (“P16”). In these three statements, Shahrizal had identified Din, the person who had given him the heroin at Upper Bedok Road on 14 Jul 17, as the Accused. I allowed the application.

17     In P14, Shahrizal had said that he had obtained the heroin found inside his food warmer bag from Din. When he was shown a set of 18 photographs and asked to point Din out from the photographs, he had picked out photograph no. 11. Photograph no. 11 was the Accused. In paragraph 75 of P16, Shahrizal had picked out two photographs[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) of a male person whom he identified to be Din. The person in the two photographs was the Accused. Shahrizal also said in the statement that the clothes which Din was wearing in these photographs were the same clothes that he had worn when they met at Upper Bedok Road to do the drug transaction. The two photographs showed the Accused wearing a black T-shirt and black pants. This was consistent with the evidence of the CNB officers who conducted surveillance that the Accused was in black attire when they saw him walking to the meeting point.

18     In his court testimony, Shahrizal explained that after his meeting with Din to buy the heroin, he had met the Accused at a different location about 50 to 100 metres away from where he had met Din. That was why he had pointed to the photographs of the Accused to CNB purportedly because the Accused was the last person he had met before his arrest. I rejected his explanation as this went against his testimony in court where he unequivocally said that after Din had passed him the heroin, he had left the place on his motorcycle. He did not mention the meeting with the Accused that happened some 50 to 100 metres away. This was also consistent with the testimonies of the CNB officers who conducted surveillance that day who saw only one meeting, and that was between him and the Accused. More pertinently, the Accused himself admitted that he had met Shahrizal at the same location where Sharizal said he had met Din. I therefore found that the evidence clearly showed that the person Din was the Accused. Shahrizal’s excuse that he had forgotten to mention the meeting with Accused after his so-called meeting with Din when testifying in court was wholly unconvincing and I rejected it.

19     In P15, at paragraph 8, Shahrizal said that he had saved Din’s handphone numbers in his handphone under the name ‘Sritongga’. This was consistent with his statement in P14, when he pointed out the handphone number XXX saved under ‘Sritongga’ as Din’s contact number. Yet in court, he claimed that he did not know who ‘Sritongga’ was. He claimed that he had just randomly pointed out the handphone number under ‘Sritongga’ when asked to point out Din’s contact numbers. He claimed that he had done this because he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms and was frightened because of the seriousness of his situation. When he was pressed to explain why he had said in P15 that the number belonged to Din, he suddenly changed tack and denied that he had said this. For good measure, he added that he was not provided lunch despite the fact that it was so recorded in P15.

20     I rejected all the different explanations offered by Shahrizal. The CNB officers who arrested him and recorded P14 from him had testified that he had appeared normal and did not appear to be suffering from withdrawal symptoms. I also noted that Shahrizal had been able to travel to and from the meeting place on his motorcycle. He had been able to communicate normally with the Accused and upon his arrest with the CNB officers. These actions were not consistent with the action of a person who was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. The evidence suggested that he was coherent and in control of his faculties. As such, I was convinced that he understood the questions that the CNB officers had asked him. I also accepted the evidence of the recorder of P15 and P16, Inspector Shafiq Basheer (“PW18”), and the Malay interpreter, Mohammad Faiz Bin Mohammad Isa (“PW17”) that the two statements were accurately recorded. They testified that Shahrizal had looked fine, composed, calm and lucid during the recordings of the two statements. In any event, they testified that Shahrizal had not raised any complaint. They also confirmed that Shahrizal had been given a break during the recording of P15 to enable him to take his lunch, which he consumed in the presence of PW17 and PW18. They also confirmed that before P16 was recorded, Shahrizal had consumed his food at the lock-up. They testified that the Accused had not complained to them that he had not been provided lunch.

21     It was inconceivable that Shahrizal had randomly picked ‘Sritongga’ out of 18 other contacts saved in his phone. It was pertinent to note that he had identified this same contact to the CNB officer on the day of his arrest five days earlier when he was asked to show them Din’s contact numbers. Under these circumstances, it was highly improbable that he had randomly chosen the same contact twice on two different occasions. The fact that the two statements, recorded five days apart, were consistent, strongly suggested that he was telling the truth in these statements. Pertinently the evidence adduced showed that the said number XXX in ‘Sritongga’ was used by the Accused. Therefore, I found that Shahrizal’s various claims to retract what he said in relation to the identity of ‘Sritongga’ in P15 constituted a belated attempt at disowning what he had unequivocally asserted in his statements.

22     For the above reasons, I was convinced that Shahrizal had given oral testimony in court which were materially inconsistent which those that he had given in P14, P15 and P16. He was unable to furnish any reasonable explanation for the inconsistencies. I therefore ruled that his credit was impeached. The three statements were admitted into evidence.

23     Shahrizal had, on or about 24 Nov 17, written to the Attorney-General’s Chambers indicating his intention to retract his statement that he had obtained the heroin from the Accused. He claimed that the Accused had nothing to do with the heroin[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). However, there was no reason given by him as to why he had falsely implicated the Accused in his CNB statements. I rejected his attempt at retraction. This was part of his attempt to claw back what he had truthfully said in his statements to CNB.

### The DNA Evidence

24     The heroin, which formed the subject-matter of the charge, was wrapped in newspaper. The bundle was then put inside a brown re-sealable envelope[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). The brown re-sealable envelope[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) (“G1A”) and the newspaper which was used to wrapped the heroin[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) (“G1A1”) were sent for DNA analysis. The analysis of the two exhibits revealed that the Accused’s DNA profile was found both on the exterior surface of G1A and on G1A1[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). I accepted the DNA evidence. The DNA evidence pointed to the fact that the Accused had handled the re-sealable envelope and the newspaper ie the heroin. As the newspaper was inside the re-sealable envelope, the only way the Accused’s DNA profile was found on the newspaper was that he had taken it out of the re-sealable envelope at some point of time during the meeting, or, more probable, when he wrapped the heroin with the newspaper before he passed it to Shahrizal. The DNA analysis result showed that the Accused was inextricably and closely linked to the heroin.

25     Therefore, the evidence showed that Shahrizal had met the Accused at Upper Bedok Road near the junction to Bedok Lane on 14 Jul 17 at about 5.00 pm. The purpose of the meeting concerns the sale of the heroin by the Accused to Shahrizal. The Accused had passed the one “batu” ie heroin which he had earlier wrapped in newspaper and then placed inside the re-sealable envelope to Shahrizal. In return, Shahrizal gave him $3000/- which was the price for the one “batu”.

### The Accused’s Evidence

26     The Accused claimed that Shahrizal was his drug supplier. As of 14 Jul 17, he had known Shahrizal for two months. They were introduced by someone who was known either as Bob or Din (“Bob/Din”). The Accused would usually buy 6.25 grams of methamphetamine from Shahrizal for about $400/- per transaction. Sometimes, in addition to the purchases, Shahrizal would give him samples to savour.

27     On 14 Jul 17, he had gone to No. 242 from his home at Tampines Avenue 1. No. 242 was the residence of his godmother. He had a bedroom for his use on the second floor of the terrace house. At about 5.00 pm, the Accused left No. 242 to meet Shahrizal. He claimed that Shahrizal had called a few days earlier to arrange the meeting. Shahrizal had wanted to repay a loan which the Accused had given to him.

28     They met at Upper Bedok Road near the junction of Bedok Lane. When Shahrizal arrived, the Accused had gestured with his hands by moving his hands upwards with the palms facing the sky. In response, Shahrizal pointed to the food warmer bag which was behind him on the seat of his motorcycle. The Accused saw an envelope in the bag. Thinking that the money was inside the envelope, he took it and opened its content. He felt the envelope and doubted that there was money inside. He looked inside the envelope to confirm this suspicion. After confirming there was no money inside, he placed it back in the bag. At this point, Shahrizal turned around. He asked Shahrizal about the money. Shahrizal picked up a plastic bag from the side of the green basket and passed it to the Accused. The money was inside the plastic bag. After that, he took some samples of methamphetamine from Shahrizal. Then they both went their separate ways.

29     He returned to No. 242 at about 9.00 pm. Shortly after his arrival, the house was raided by CNB. He was in the living room then. He was searched and handcuffed. After that, he was brought to the bedroom on the upper floor. He was asked if there were drugs in the bedroom. Initially he said no. In the midst of the search, he then informed the CNB officers that he had something under his pants ie the sample of methamphetamine and the glass drug-taking utensil. He also disclosed the presence of another packet of methamphetamine behind the cupboard[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). A further search by the officers revealed a quantity of cannabis from the top compartment of the same cupboard[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14).

30     The Accused was then brought to his residential home at Tampines Avenue 1. Nothing incriminating was found. From there, he was brought to Tanglin Police Divisional Headquarters (HQ) for an instant urine test. After that, he was brought to CNB HQ at the Police Cantonment Complex.

31     At the CNB HQ, he met Shahrizal. He claimed that Shahrizal was suffering from severe withdrawal syndrome. The Accused was then sent to Alexandra Hospital because his groin was bleeding. After that, he returned to CNB HQ. Subsequently both the Accused and Shahrizal were conveyed to the Changi Medical Centre (CMC) to monitor their drug withdrawal. The Accused claimed that CMC refused to admit Shahrizal into their ward because of his condition. Instead he was sent to the Changi General Hospital. The Accused also disclosed that while he was in remand, he suffered a stroke. Subsequently he was released on bail.

32     I rejected the Accused’s claim that he had loaned Shahrizal $12,000/- and that the purpose of the meeting on 14 Jul 17 was to collect the debt. The evidence showed that the Accused was not a man of means. By his own admission, he was the sole breadwinner of his family, but he had been unemployed since March 2017. Prior to that he had worked at a restaurant earning about $1500/- a month. By 14 Jul 17, he had chalked up numerous debts. During this same period, his drug consumption habit had continued unabated. In fact, he had been consuming non-stop since 2005. He had not provided evidence of the source for the $12,000/-. Under these circumstances, it was improbable that he had the means to loan Shahrizal $12,000/-.

33     Shahrizal was only known to him for only about two months prior to 14 Jul 17. They were not good or close friends. His relationship with Shahrizal was a purely professional one ie supplier-customer relationship. There was no reason why he would loan such a big amount to someone whom he hardly knew. More significantly, the Accused claimed that he was asked to furnish the loan to Shahrizal by Bob/Din. He said he trusted Bob/Din as a friend. But his failure to call Bob/Din as a witness to corroborate this important facet of his defence could only mean that there was no Bob/Din, there was no call, and there was no loan.

34     Another aspect of the Accused’s evidence which I found unbelievable was his evidence in relation to his handling of G1A (the re-sealable envelope) containing the heroin. He said that when Shahrizal had gestured to the basket on his motorcycle, he had picked up G1A. Although he admitted that the envelope was not similar to the ones which Shahrizal had used to make prior loan repayments, he had taken it because it was the only envelope he saw. He had then felt G1A to ascertain its contents. He had also taken G1A1 out from G1A. When he realised that the money was not inside, he had put G1A1 back into G1A, and then placed G1A back into the basket. His version was wholly different from the version given by Shahrizal at \[15\] above.

35     I found the Accused’s evidence above contrived. If he was unsure about the envelope, he could have easily confirmed with Shahrizal instead of going through the rigmarole of feeling it’s content. Alternatively, he could have looked at the contents through the clear strip of window found in G1A. When confronted with this, his explanation was that he was not sure whether there was such a clear window. I found his explanation unbelievable. The clear window was wide and ran across G1A. It was very unlikely that the Accused had not seen it. The contents G1A1 could clearly be seen through the clear window[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15). Therefore, there was no conceivable reason for him to take G1A1 out from G1A. It was clear that he had concocted this version of events in an attempt to tailor his story to explain away the fact that his DNA profile was found on both G1A and G1A1.

36     I therefore found that the prosecution has proven their case against the Accused on the charge beyond reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty of the charge and duly convicted him on the charge.

## GUILTY PLEA TO REMAINING CHARGES

### Background

37     After his conviction, the Accused accepted the prosecution’s offer in relation to the remaining four charges. He pleaded guilty to the one count of possession of not less than 15.12 grams of methamphetamine without authorisation under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) MDA (DAC 944951/17), and one count of consumption of methamphetamine under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33(1) MDA (DAC 944954/17). One count of possession of not less than 12.95 grams of cannabis mixture and one count of possession of drug taking implement (one glassware with attachment, one pipe and one tube) under s 9 punishable under s 33(1) MDA, were taken into consideration (TIC).

### The Facts

38     The drug exhibits and the drug taking implements were seized when CNB officers raided No 242 on the night of 14 Jul 17 at about 9.15 pm. They seized one packet of a crystalline substance inside the Accused’s sling bag and another packet of a crystalline substance taped behind the wardrobe in the Accused’s bedroom on the first floor. He admitted ownership of the two packets. These two packets were the subject-matter of the possession charge in DAC 944951/17.

39     Pursuant to the raid, the Accused’s urine samples were procured and analysed by HSA. The analysis confirmed that the urine samples contained methamphetamine. The Accused admitted that he had been an ‘ice’ addict for the last 12 years before his arrest. He also admitted that he had last consumed ‘ice’ on the same day before he was arrested.

## ACCUSED’S ANTECEDENTS

40     The Accused has unrelated previous convictions –

(i)     On 8 Jul 88, he was placed on two years’ probation for theft by a servant under s 381 of the Penal Code. Cap 224.

(ii)     On 30 Nov 93, he was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment a similar offence under s 381 Penal Code, and three months’ imprisonment for theft in dwelling under s 380 Penal Code. Both sentences ran consecutively, making the total sentence five months’ imprisonment.

(iii)     On 17 Nov 98, he was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment for house-breaking and theft with common intention under s 457 read with s 34 Penal Code.

(iv)     On 29 Nov 01, he was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for a similar offence under s 457 punishable under s 458A Penal Code.

## SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

41     The prosecution sought for a 15 months’ imprisonment in respect of the possession and consumption of methamphetamine charges. As for the trafficking charge, it sought for a 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane.

42     The prosecution submitted that the Accused’s plea of guilty to the possession and consumption charges should be accorded little or no weight. This was because the case against the Accused was very strong and the prosecution would have no difficulty in proving the case against him: _PP v Tay Beng Guan Albert_ at \[16\].

43     It was pointed out that the Accused was a long standing drug abuser. By his own admission, he had consumed drugs since 2005. This fact taken together with the TIC charges showed that his possession and consumption offences were not a one-off incident. He could not be treated as a first time drug offender and so should not be entitled to a sentencing discount: _PP v Tan Thian Earn_ at \[66\] (“_Tan Thian Earn_”).

44     The prosecution cited some case precedents on s 8(a) MDA which showed a sentencing range of between 10 to 18 months’ imprisonment for possession of methamphetamine weighing between 0.07 grams to 20.7 grams. In particular, she pointed out three cases; (i) _PP v Muhammad Noor Aszali Bin Ali_ (DAC 915776/16) where 15 months’ imprisonment was meted out for 7.78 grams of methamphetamine, (ii) _PP v Tan Zhao Yuan_ where 18 months’ imprisonment was imposed for 6.39 grams of methamphetamine, and (iii) _Tan Thian Earn_ where 18 months’ imprisonment was imposed for 0.77 grams of methamphetamine. Like the Accused, the offenders in these cases had unrelated antecedents. Given that the weight of the methamphetamine in the present case was 15.12 grams, the prosecution submitted that the proposed 15 months’ imprisonment sentences for the consumption and possession charges was well within the sentencing range.

45     On the trafficking charge, the weight of the methamphetamine was not less than 9.48 grams. Applying _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ (_“Vasentha”_), the indicative starting point was between 13 to 15 years’ imprisonment with 10 to 11 strokes of the cane. The prosecution highlighted that Shahrizal received a sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane on the same trafficking charge. However, Shahrizal had pleaded guilty whilst the Accused had claimed trial. And in the course of the trial, the Accused had cast allegations against the CNB officers for conduct unbecoming and alleged that Shahrizal was his drug supplier. On account of these factors, it was submitted that a sentence higher than that received by Shahrizal should be imposed ie, 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane.

46     Finally, the prosecution asked that the imprisonment sentences in the trafficking charge and either the possession or consumption charge be ordered to run consecutively.

## PLEA IN MITIGATION

47     The Accused put in a written letter of mitigation. He admitted that his drug addiction had caused havoc to him and his family. But he had found it impossible to quit. After he had suffered from a stroke while in remand, he had an epiphany. He started to seek help for his drug addiction. He pleaded for a lenient sentence as he feared losing his family if he was incarcerated for a lengthy period. He highlighted that he had no drug record.

48     The Accused also sought that his sentence imposed be backdated as he was in remand for about five months before his release on bail. Finally, he sought forgiveness and offered his genuine remorse for his actions.

## THE SENTENCE

### The Trafficking Charge

49     For the trafficking charge, I applied _Vasentha_, and agreed that the indicative starting point was 13 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 10 to 11 strokes of the cane. I was also guided by the sentence imposed on Shahrizal for the same trafficking charge. I agreed that because the Accused had claimed trial, there should be an uplift in the sentence from that imposed on Shahrizal. I also took into account that in the course of the trial, the Accused had cast spurious allegations against the CNB officers during the raid at No. 242, accusing them of treating him badly. He had also tried to cast Shahrizal as his drug supplier when in reality it was the other way around. As such, I sentenced him to 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the case.

### The Possession Charge

50     For the possession charge, the weight of the methamphetamine was 15.12 grams, a not insubstantial amount. Using the cases cited by the prosecution as a guide, for that amount, the appropriate sentence should be in the region of 12 to 15 months’ imprisonment. Given the prosecution’s submissions at \[43\] and \[44\], which I accepted, I sentenced the Accused to 15 months’ imprisonment on the possession charge.

### The Consumption Charge

51     The Accused was not a one-off abuser of drugs. By his own admission, he had abused drugs since 2005. As he had described in his mitigation plea, his addiction had remained unabated and sustained. Although he has no record for drug consumption, he could not be treated as a first offender. The usual benchmark for a consumption offence in this context was between 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment. In light of \[43\] and \[44\], I sentenced the Accused to 15 months’ imprisonment for the consumption charge.

52     I ordered that the imprisonment sentences in the trafficking and consumption charges run consecutively, making the total aggregate sentence 15 years’ and 15 months’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. I also gave a direction to the Director Prisons that the Accused period in remand from 15 Jul 17 to 11 Dec 17 was to be considered by the Prisons Department when computing the Accused’s date of release. This was to take into account the fact that he was remanded during this period before his release on bail.

53     The Accused has lodged an appeal against the conviction for the trafficking charge and sentence. He is on bail pending appeal.
