\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9059/2020/01.\]

7 April 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## I.   INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused.

2       The Accused, a 28 year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to one charge under s.326 read with s.34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”), for being together with an unknown male, in furtherance of the common intention, voluntarily causing grievous hurt to one Ong Cheong Yi (”Ong” or “The Victim”) using instruments, when used as weapons, were likely to cause death. A wrench and a knuckleduster were used to hit Ong’s head and face, inflicting multiple injuries, including a fracture of the _dento-alveolus_. The incident occurred at about 2140 hrs on 6 December 2017 at LASALLE College of the Arts (“LCA”) located at 1 McNally Street, Singapore.

## II.   FACTS OF THE CASE

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification.

4       The Victim, Ong, was acquainted with the Accused. Ong had invested $10,000 on a music track that the Accused and a mutual friend, one “Leon”, were creating.

5       On 6 December 2017 at about 2100 hrs, unbeknownst to Leon, the Victim met one “Kevin” and one “Ronin” at the lowercase café at LCA at 1 McNally Street to discuss a dispute between Ronin and Leon over a sum of $290. The Accused found out about the meeting and informed Leon. As such, the Victim called the Accused an “asshole” over Whatsapp.

6       The Accused then contacted the Victim and asked him to remain at LCA until 2130 hrs. At 2140 hrs, four unknown individuals arrived at the scene. This included the unknown co-accused. The Accused subsequently arrived in his black Mercedes. The Accused then took out a wrench wrapped in newspaper from his boot. The co-accused took out a knuckleduster and wore it on his fist.

7       The Accused then began yelling and shouting at the Victim. He hit the Victim twice over the head with the wrench. The co-accused struck the Victim’s lower lip with the knuckleduster.

8       The Victim sought medical treatment at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital (“MENH”). A medical report from Dr Goh Siak Shyong of the Oralmaxillofacial Practice at MENH stated that:

> i.     There were traumatic dental injuries involving the dislocation of the lower left central incisor and a 2 cm deep laceration on the right side of the lower lip;

> ii.     Three teeth had devitalized secondary to the impact from the assault and required root canal treatment.

9       A summary discharge from MENH indicated that the Victim had suffered a Dento-Alveolar Fracture. He was given 14 days of medical leave.

## III.   ANTECEDENTS

10     The Accused has no antecedents.

## IV.   SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE

### a.   Prosecution’s Submission

11     The Prosecution referred to **_J Ravinthiran v P_** _<span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 173</span>_ to support its submission that 24 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was not excessive. It was highlighted that when _Ravinthiran_ was decided, the maximum sentence for a s.326 offence was 10 years’ imprisonment. Then, Yung Pung How CJ at \[53\] noted that the _“ … sentencing norm for offences under s.326 averages two and a half to four years imprisonment, with nine to 12 of the cane”._

12     The aggravating factors in this case were highlighted at \[9\] of the Prosecution’s Written Submission on Sentence. They are summarised below.

> i.      Premeditated Offence: The Accused had asked the Victim to wait at LCA. Meanwhile he took steps to round up several unknown individuals and obtained a weapon in the form of a wrench. One of the assailants was armed with a knuckleduster, a scheduled weapon under the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (“CESOWA”) which could cause serious injuries, and it was not inconceivable that these unknown individuals were told that he was intending to assault the Victim;

> ii.      Very Little Provocation: All the Victim did was to call the Accused an “asshole” over Whatsapp;

> iii.      Group violence: The Accused had converged upon the Victim in a group. It significantly increased the likelihood that the Victim was more fearful. In fact, one person in that group caused the said injuries;

> iv.      The offence was committed in a public place: This demonstrated the brazenness of the Accused’s conduct and blatant disregard for law and order.

### b.   Plea in Mitigation & Submission on Sentence by the Defence

#### Plea in Mitigation

13     The Defence offered the following mitigating factors to the court:

> i.      Provocation. The act was impulsive. The Accused was provoked when the Victim called him “asshole” over Whatsapp[^1];

> ii.      Injury. The injury was a “simple” fracture. The injury was a _“… minor fracture to the alveolar bone surrounding the dislocated tooth. Ong \[the Victim\], did not suffer any major fracture of the jawbone.”_[^2]

> iii.      Restitution. He voluntarily compensated the Victim fully the day after the incident for his injury as well as for his travel expenses to the hospital;

> iv.      Mental Condition. According to Dr Julia Lam, he was suffering from Adjustment Disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct (309.4; DSM-5; APA) at or around the time of the offence. He also displayed symptoms of a Post-traumatic Stress Disorder that stemmed from witnessing a female friend’s suicide 4 years ago and struggled with substance reliance issues and suicidal tendencies. These factors which contributed significantly to his behaviour that night;[^3]

> v.      Propensity for rehabilitation. He is in the initial stages of an exciting career in the music industry. He also has a strong support system and his familial circumstances are conducive for his continued rehabilitation;

> vi.      Others. The Accused is a young offender and this was his first brush with the law. He was not a violent person and the incident were out of character. Character testimonials were annexed to the Plea in Mitigation for the court’s consideration. He had also pleaded guilty at an early stage.

#### Defence Submission on Sentence

14     The Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence was 10 months’ imprisonment and a fine. The Defence cited several cases as precedents. These are summarised below:

15     It was submitted that the Accused was less culpable when compared to the offenders in _ACI, Victor Samuel_ and _Lim See Yong_ for the following reasons:

> i.      Injuries. The injuries suffered by the Ong _“paled in comparison with the injuries suffered by the victims in these three cases”[^4]_. They were transient in nature. The victim in _Lim See Yong_ suffered permanent injuries while the victims in _ACI_ and _Victor Samuel_ had to be hospitalised and had immediate surgical procedures;

> ii.      Weapons used. The weapons used in this case, the wrench used by the Accused and the knuckleduster by the co-accused was a lot _less_ dangerous than the weapons used by the offenders in _ACI_ (chopper), _Victor Samuel_ (iron rod) and _Lim See Yong_ (chopper);

> iii.      Nature of the assault. The Accused conduct was a lot less violent and vicious than that of the offender in _ACI_.

16     Hence, the Prosecution’s submission of 24 months’ imprisonment was not sustainable and urged the court to impose a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment and a fine.

## V.   PUNISHMENT PRESCRIBED BY LAW

17     The offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s.326 of the PC provides that:

> _“Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335,voluntarily causes grievous hurt by means of …… any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, ……_, **_shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning_**_.”_

## VI.   SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

18     In determining sentence, the two-step framework prescribed by the Court of Appeal in **_PP v BDB_** _<span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (”BDB”)_ for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code is instructive. In _BDB_, the High Court was of the view that, in the case of s.325 offences, the primary sentencing objective is likely to be one of deterrence. Sunderesh Menon CJ set out the two-step process in the sentencing of s.325 offences at \[55\]:

> _“(a_)     _First, because of the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s.325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing._

> (_b_)     _Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and presence of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.”_

19     At \[56\], the Court of Appeal went on to state:

> “In our judgment, given the inherent mischief that underlies the offence under s 325, and considering that a more severe sentencing range is prescribed for this offence (compared to the offence of voluntarily causing simple hurt under s 323) precisely because grievous hurt has been caused, the factor that should guide the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing should be the seriousness of the hurt caused to the Victim. As we have already noted, s 325 encompasses a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a simple fracture to death. We do not propose to set out a range of indicative starting points for each type of grievous hurt, but what is relevant for present purposes is that in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of death (as in the case of the first charge against the Respondent), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years, which is close to the maximum imprisonment term of ten years; whereas in a case where the grievous hurt takes the form of multiple fractures of the type and gravity described in the sixth charge against the Respondent, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around three years and six months. For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to make it clear that the indicative starting point might be higher or lower depending on the type and seriousness of the injuries caused. These indicative starting points may then be calibrated upwards or downwards in view of the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.”

20     The present case is one for an offence under s.326, namely, causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means, I am therefore, also guided by the High Court in **_Ng Kim Soon v PP_** _<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span>_ (“_Ng Kim Soon_”). In _Ng Kim Soon_, the accused was charged with an offence under s.324, namely causing voluntary hurt by dangerous weapons or means. Sunderesh Menon CJ set out the following three-step approach at \[12\]:

> “ … First, I considered what would be the appropriate sentence had the hurt alone been subject of an offence under s.323. Second, I then considered the application of a suitable uplift, having regard to the dangerous means used In this connection, I considered it appropriate, as a matter of principle, to have regard to the potential harm that could result from the chosen means of offending. This seemed to me to follow from the fact that some of the dangerous means prescribed in s 324 were identified by reference to their potential for causing harm, such as means likely to cause death, when in most cases brought under the provision death will not in fact have been caused. Finally, I then calibrated the sentence to what I considered was appropriate having considered the particular aggravating or mitigating circumstances at play.”

## VII.   THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE

21     Keeping in mind the primary sentencing objective of a s.325 offence, and the two-step process set out in _BDB_, I proceeded to apply the three-step sentencing approach laid out in _Ng Soon Kim_.

### a.   Step 1: Notional starting sentence under s.325 simpliciter

22     The High Court in **_Low Song Chye v PP_** _<span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>_ laid down a sentencing framework in s.323 cases for first-time offenders who pleaded guilty. However, the Court of Appeal at \[56\] in _BDB_ did not propose to set out a range of indicative starting points for each type of grievous hurt because the offence encompassed a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt ranging from a simple fracture to death. Instead, the Court highlighted that where:

> i.     Death was caused, the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around 8 years;

> ii.     Multiple Fractures of the type and gravity in _BDB_[^5], the indicative starting point should be around three years and 6 months’ imprisonment.

23     In addition to _BDB_, I have highlighted several recent cases below where the courts have dealt with cases involving offences under s.325. Whilst these cases involved very different facts, they provided a broad flavour of the range of sentences that have been meted out by the courts for s.325 offences. The cases are briefly summarised as follows:

24     With due respect to the Defence, whilst the injuries suffered by Ong may not be as serious as some of the injuries sustained by some of the victims described in the precedent cases above, I would not characterised them as “simple fractures” or as being _“…. transient and a lot more superficial”_[^6]. This would trivialise the injury and hurt suffered by him.

25     Ong suffered traumatic dental injuries involving the dislocation of the lower left incisor and a 2 cm _deep_ laceration on the right side of the lower lip and a _dento-alveolar_ fracture. Three teeth required root canal treatment and “long term monitoring, with a view of possible removal in future and replacement with implants should their condition continue to deteriorate”[^7]. He was warded for a day and thereafter given 14 days’ medical leave.

26     In _Arumugam Selvaraj_, the degree of harm was identified by the High Court at \[13\] as being at the low end of the moderate range. In _Ng Shiuh Shao_, the degree of harm was also identified as being moderate by the district judge. Therefore, taking into account the nature of the injuries suffered by Ong, I would describe the degree of harm being in the middle range of the moderate scale when compared with the spectrum of harm in cases of grievous hurt_._

27     With regard to the indicative starting sentence, I note that the High Court in _Arumugam Selvaraj_ was of the view that the appropriate starting point was six months’ imprisonment. In _Ng Shiuh Shao_, whilst the final sentence was 24 months’ imprisonment, the offender there had several violence related antecedents. I was of the view that the injuries suffered by Ong was more serious than the harm suffered by the victim in _Arumugam Selvaraj_ but less serious than that suffered by the victim in _Lek Lai Seng_. Therefore, I adjudge that the appropriate sentencing range here would be in the range of between 9-12 months’ imprisonment.

### b.   Step 2: The appropriate uplift to account for the weapon used

28     The second step of the sentencing approach laid out in _Ng Soon Kim_ involves an appropriate uplift to account for the dangerous weapon or means used to inflict the hurt. This step takes into account the _potential_ harm posed by the dangerous or means. At \[11\], the Court held that the more inherently dangerous the weapon or means, the greater the _potential_ harm and higher the level of egregiousness. As per Sunderesh Menon CJ,

> “ Some of these means, such as using an instrument for shooting, or using a weapon likely to cause death, are likely to be inherently more egregious than other means, such as the use of a substance deleterious to the body or by means of an animal, although even in the latter, much will depend on the particular facts. By way of example, if the accused person were to use an animal to inflict harm, the gravity and egregiousness would vary greatly depending on whether, for instance, a king cobra was used as compared to if a small dog was used.”

29     I note that an uplift to account for any weapons used was also considered in _BDB_ at \[67\]. The Court acknowledge that an offender

> “ …. may even be prosecuted under the aggravated offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means under s 326 of the Penal Code, which carries a higher maximum sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment or even life imprisonment and may also include a fine or caning. In addition, regard should be had to the nature of the weapon and the way it was used, and how these aggravate the offender’s culpability”.

30     In _Ng Kim Soon_, the offender sprayed a can of insecticide on the victim, whilst at the same time, he lit a lighter, igniting an aerosol stream and creating a flash fire lasting about 3 seconds. Sunderesh Menon CJ observed at \[15\] that this act “_would not be trivial by any means, but neither would it be at the high end of serious culpability”_. Nonetheless, the Court was of the view at \[16\] that the acts here warranted a substantial uplift of six months imprisonment as:

> “…. the flame was lit in a confined space, which caused alarm to others, including the Victim’s passenger and carried with it the potential for more harm than in fact transpired if, for instance, some part of the vehicle’s interior had caught fire. Furthermore, the offence took place in the middle of a busy road intersection, which might have given rise to some public alarm … .”

31     In contrast to the dangerous weapon used in _Ng Kim Soon_, the dangerous weapons used in the instant case were a wrench and a knuckleduster. Even if one were to describe the wrench wrapped in newspaper as being not inherently dangerous, the same cannot be said of a knuckleduster. The sole purpose of a knuckleduster is to inflict as serious an injury as possible in a fight by concentrating the force of a punch into as small an area as possible. It is not surprising that it is classified as a scheduled weapon under the CESOWA. Therefore, if an aerosol stream attracted an uplift of 6 months’ imprisonment for an offence under s.324, the uplift for a more serious offence under s.326 for using a knuckleduster alone, would, in my opinion, be more than the 6 month uplift in _Ng Kim Soon_. In this case, considering the fact that the dangerous weapons used were a wrench _and_ a knuckleduster I assessed this uplift to be in the range of 9-12 months’ imprisonment.

32     With the second step completed, the indicative sentencing range would now be between 18-24 months’ imprisonment.

### c.   Step 3: Calibrating for aggravating and mitigating circumstances

33     The third step in the sentencing approach in _Ng Soon Kim_ entails adjusting the overall sentence to account for the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the case.

#### Aggravating Factors

34     The Prosecution submitted that the following factors would justify the calibrating of the final sentence _upwards_. These were:

> i.      Deliberation or Premeditation. The facts revealed clearly that there was premeditation. He asked the Victim remain at LAC, while in the meantime, he recruited several unknown individuals to meet him at there. In addition, the Accused took steps to obtain a wrench that he wrapped in newspaper. The Defence suggested that there was no premeditation.[^8] I disagreed;

> ii.      Provocation. All the Victim did was to call the Accused an “asshole” over Whatsapp. I agreed that his subsequent act of attacking the unarmed Victim was a grossly disproportionate response. What made the Accused even more culpable was the fact that more than two hours had elapsed it between the “provocative” message being sent and the attack;

> iii.      Group Violence. Although the Accused is charged for causing the Victim grievous hurt together with one unknown male, there were four unknown individuals that were present. I have no doubt that the presence of these four unknown individuals (including the unknown co-accused) would increase the likelihood of the Victim feeling more intimidated and fearful. This would increase the Accused’s culpability; and

> iv.      Offence occurred in a public place. The offence was committed in a public place, in particular at a café. It occurred at 2140 hrs, where it is likely that there were still patrons. I agreed that this demonstrated a blatant disregard for law and order and increased the Accused’s culpability.

35     I was thus of the view that the appropriate uplift for these aggravating factors in the instant case was at least 6 months’ imprisonment. This would therefore give a sentencing range of 24-30 months’ imprisonment

#### Mitigating Factors

36     I also considered the other mitigating factors highlighted by the Defence. This included:

> i.      Acted on impulse[^9]. In my view, the Accused could not be said to have acted on impulse. He had obviously given some thought to the matter. This could be seen by preparations he made, including obtaining a wrench and calling the found unknown individuals to be present at LCA. I put little or no weight on this;

> ii.      Remorse. The Accused is remorseful for his actions. This is seen by his timely and comprehensive offer of restitution and was made voluntarily. He had also apologised to the Victim after the altercation;

> iii.      Mental Condition. While I did consider his mental condition as a mitigating factor, I regarded it with some circumspection in light of the seriousness of the offence. In _BDB_, the Court at \[72\] noted that although mitigating value may be attributed to an offender’s mental condition,

>> “…. the sentencing principle of general deterrence may be accorded full weight in circumstances where the offender’s mental condition is not serious or is not casually related to the commission of the offence and the offence is a serious one”

> iv.      Other Factors. I noted that the Accused is a first offender. In addition, he has chosen to plead guilty at an early stage.

37     In light of the relevant mitigating factors, I was of the view that a slight discount of about 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment should be accorded to the Accused, keeping in mind that the primary sentencing objective for an offence under s.325 was likely to be deterrence.

38     Having gone through the three-step sentencing approach in _Ng Soon Kim_, I arrived at an indicative sentencing range of 20 to 27 months’ imprisonment.

### d.   Other Considerations

#### Final Calibrations

39     Cases involving s.326 offences not only encompass a broad spectrum of different forms of grievous hurt (ie s.325) as well as a wide variety of the nature or type of dangerous weapon or means that could be used to inflict the grievous hurt. These cases are generally fact-centric but the precedents provide a flavour as to the sentences that have been imposed by the courts. I looked at the precedent cases for s.326 PC offences referred to by the Defence to determine whether any final calibrations were required in determining the final sentence to be imposed:

> i.      _ACL_. This case was generally unhelpful. The principal offence faced by the offender was attempted homicide under s.308 PC for which the offender was sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment. No explanation was given by the Judge as to why a 1 years’ imprisonment term was imposed for the s.326 PC offence except that the offender injured this victim while trying to protect the first victim;[^10]

> ii.      _Victor Samuel_. The sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane imposed was generally consistent with the indicative sentencing range in the instant case. The lower sentence could be justified as there was no group violence or premeditation;

> iii.      _Lee See Yong_. There was also no group violence or premeditation. While the injuries to the victim was caused by a chopper and were more serious, I note that the trial judge at \[96\] was of the view that _“ … the provocation – viz the Victim’s Hokkien expletives and his push of the Accused – which set in train the attack were relevant mitigating factors”_. In the instant case, I note there was very little or almost no provocation. The sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment in _Lee See Yong_ was therefore, in my view, also consistent with the indicative sentencing range in the present case.

40     Hence, I found no reason to calibrate the indicative sentencing range any further.

#### Caning

41     The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of three strokes of the cane should be imposed, in addition to any sentence of imprisonment. The Defence did not really address the Court on this point in its sentencing submissions although I note that the Defence had sought a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment and a fine.

42     In _BDB_, the Court considered the question of caning for s.325 offences. At \[76\], Sunderesh Menon CJ noted,

> “In cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code, our courts have invariably imposed, in addition to imprisonment sentences, caning of _at least_ six strokes where the offender in question is not exempted from caning under the CPC. As the authors of _Sentencing Practice_ have noted (at p 266), caning “is also appropriate unless there are exceptional circumstances”. Where violence has been inflicted on a Victim, retribution is likely to be the principal sentencing consideration that warrants the imposition of caning … whereas where non-fatal serious injury is caused, a sentence of between six and 12 strokes of the cane may be considered.”

43     Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution that caning should be imposed. There were no “exceptional circumstances”. Having considered all the factors in this case, I was of the view that the appropriate number of strokes should be less than the six to 12 stroke range set out by the Court in _BDB_. Hence, the Prosecution’s submission of three strokes of the cane was a fair one.

## VII.   SENTENCE IMPOSED

44     All considered, a sentence of imprisonment in the lower end of the sentencing range of 20-27 months’ was appropriate in the present case. As was the sentence of three strokes of the cane. I therefore sentenced the Accused to

> **21 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the Cane**

45     I allowed the Accused to defer the commencement of the sentence until 16 March 2020. However, the Accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, filed a Notice of Appeal on 25 February 2020. He was thereafter offered bail pending appeal and is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.
