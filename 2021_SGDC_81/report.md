### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Background

1       The accused, Jeremiah Lim Kok Kee, a male Singaporean aged 61, who was unrepresented, claimed trial to two charges. The first charge was under s 332 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) for voluntarily causing hurt to a police officer who was discharging his duty as a public servant by punching his left arm multiple times (“Penal Code charge”). The second charge was under s 79 of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed) for obstructing a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) officer from taking possession of the HDB flat where the accused was residing (“HDB charge”). The Prosecution proceeded with both charges in the same trial pursuant to s 134 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) as they arose from the same incident and formed part of the same transaction. I convicted the accused of both charges at the end of the trial and I sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment for the Penal Code charge and fined him $4000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment for the HDB charge.

2       The accused being dissatisfied with his conviction and sentence has appealed against my decision. He is presently on bail pending his appeal and I have granted a stay on the payment of the fine.

3       I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The charges

4       The Penal Code charge and the HDB charge that the accused claimed trial to read as follows:

> (a)     DAC-935232-2018 (exhibit C1C)

1st CHARGE (Amended)

>> You, are charged that you, on the 24th day of October 2018, at or about 10.39am, at Blk 107B Edgefield Plains #XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to a public servant, namely one Police Sergeant Chan Jun Jie, to wit, by punching the said Police Sergeant Chan Jun Jie’s left arm multiple times, in the discharge of his duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev. Ed).

> (b)     MAC-910446-2018 (exhibit C2E)

2nd CHARGE (Amended)

>> You, are charged that you, on the 24th day of October 2018, sometime between 9.30am and 11.00am, at Blk 107B Edgefield Plains #XXX, Singapore (“the Flat”), did obstruct one Christopher Lim, an officer of the Housing and Development Board (“the Board”), in the performance of the taking possession of the Flat, which the Board is empowered to do under section 59(1) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 2004 Rev Ed), to wit, by refusing to open the gate to the Flat despite being served a notice to take possession and being requested by the said Christopher Lim to open the gate and vacate the Flat; and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 79 of the said Act.

## Undisputed facts

5       The accused purchased the HDB flat at Blk 107B Edgefield Plains #XXX, Singapore (“the flat”) in 2001. He took out a HDB mortgage loan of $128,300 for the purchase. He fell into arrears in 2007. Over the years, HDB engaged the accused on numerous occasions by way of letters, telephone calls, house visits and meetings at its branch office to try to resolve the issue but the payments remained outstanding. On 13 March 2013, HDB informed the accused in writing that it intended to compulsorily acquire the flat. Eventually HDB scheduled to evict the accused from the flat on 24 October 2018 at 10am.

6       The incidents in both charges took place during the scheduled eviction in the morning of 24 October 2018 at the flat. In respect of the HDB charge, the accused did not dispute that PW6 Christopher Lim was a HDB officer and that PW6 Christopher Lim had requested the accused to open the gate and to vacate the flat. The accused admitted that he had refused to open the gate and vacate the flat between 9.30am and 11am because he contended that the eviction was illegal. In respect of the Penal Code charge, the accused did not dispute that PW4 Special Constable (“SC”) Sergeant Chan Jun Jie was a public servant who was discharging his duty as a police officer at the material time. The accused admitted that he had punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s hand several times but claimed that he was acting in self-defence.

## The elements of the charges

### The HDB charge

7       S 59(1) and s 79 of the Housing and Development Act stipulated as follows:

> 59.—(1)    Where any flat, house or other living accommodation has been vested in the Board pursuant to section 47, 52 or 57, the Board may proceed to take possession of the flat, house or other living accommodation on the expiry of a period of 30 days after the service of a notice on the owner thereof.

> 79.    —Any person who obstructs any officer of the Board, or any person duly authorised by the Board in that behalf, in the performance of any thing which the Board is by this Act required or empowered to do shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.

8       The Prosecution was required to prove the following elements of the HDB charge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt:

> (a)     That HDB was empowered to take possession of the flat pursuant to s 59(1) of the Housing and Development Act;

> (b)     That the accused had obstructed PW6 Christopher Lim in the performance of taking possession of the flat by refusing to open the gate despite (i) having been served a notice that HDB would be taking possession of the flat and (ii) being requested by PW6 Christopher Lim to open the gate and vacate the flat (“actus reus”); and

> (c)     That the accused intended to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim from taking possession of the flat (“mens rea”).

### The Penal Code charge

9       The Prosecution was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had voluntarily caused hurt to PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) by punching his left arm multiple times when PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was discharging his duty as a public servant.

## The HDB charge

### HDB was empowered to take possession of the flat pursuant to s 59 of the Housing and Development Act

10     S 59(1) of the Housing and Development Act provided that where any flat had been vested in HDB, HDB may proceed to take possession of the flat after it had served a notice to take possession on the owner and 30 days had expired after the service of the notice.

11     On the evidence adduced before me, I was satisfied that HDB was empowered to take possession of the flat because the flat had been vested in HDB and HDB had served the requisite notice to take possession of the flat on the accused and that 30 days had expired after the service of such a notice. I set out below the material evidence that supported my findings.

12     Both PW6 Christopher Lim, the General Manager of HDB Punggol Branch and PW7 Celia Lee, the HDB case manager in charge of the accused’s flat, testified that the accused was owing mortgage arrears on the flat for many years. Exhibit P15, a letter dated 18 December 2015 which HDB wrote to the accused in response to his representations made through his Members of Parliament, set out the purchase and mortgage history of the flat. Exhibit P15 narrated succinctly that the accused had bought the flat in August 2001 and obtained a HDB loan of $128,300 for the purchase. As early as May 2002, the accused had applied to HDB to be allowed to pay reduced instalments. In March 2003, he had also applied to defer the instalment payments. There were other similar applications. The accused fell into arrears since 2007. From 2012, there had been no payments towards the loan instalments. As at January 2012, the accused’s outstanding loan was $147,718.51.

13     Both PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee told the court that on 13 March 2013, HDB served a notice on the accused stating HDB’s intention to compulsorily acquire the flat under s 56(1)(k) of the Housing and Development Act (“Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition”). The Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8) was pasted on the main door of the flat on 13 March 2013. The accused initially claimed that he did not receive the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8)[^1] but he subsequently told the court that he “think” he received it [^2].

14     HDB notified the accused in the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8) that it intended to compulsorily acquire the flat on the ground that the accused owed arrears of monthly instalments and that HDB would pay the accused compensation of $418,500 for the flat, subject to the discharge of his mortgage loan (with interest) and deduction of all monies owing to HDB, the Town Council or other authorities, plus Goods and Services Tax on such monies payable and all disbursement incurred by HDB. It was also clearly stated under “Note” on the second page of the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8) at note number 5 that in the event of compulsory acquisition, the flat would be repossessed by HDB and the accused would be required to vacate the flat.

15     The Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8) also drew the accused’s attention to ss 56(4), (5) and (6) of the Housing and Development Act. S 56(4) required any flat owner, who objected to a proposed acquisition by HDB, to submit the grounds of his objection to the acquisition and compensation offered by HDB in writing within 28 days after the service of a notice of intention to acquire the premises. S 56(5) required HDB to consider the objection and serve the owner a written notice of its decision. S 56(6) stipulated that if any flat owner was aggrieved by the decision of HDB, the flat owner had the right of appeal to the Minister within 28 days after the date of service of such decision on the owner.

16     For easy reference, the relevant provisions under s 56 of the Housing and Development Act are re-produced below:

> 56.—(1)    The Board may compulsorily acquire any flat, house or other living accommodation sold subject to the provisions of this Part, whether before or after 2nd June 1975 —

>> (k)    if the rent or any payment or any part thereof due to the Board reserved under the lease or mortgage remains unpaid for 3 calendar months after it is due and payable and the Board has sent a notice of demand in writing to the owner thereof;

> ………………..

> (3)    Where the Board intends to exercise its powers of compulsory acquisition conferred by this section, the Board shall serve a notice in writing on the owner of the flat, house or other living accommodation and all persons known or believed to be interested in claiming all or any part of the compensation to be paid for the flat, house or other living accommodation (referred to in this Part as an interested person) stating the intention of the Board to acquire the premises and the compensation to be paid therefor.

> (4)    Any owner or interested person who objects to a proposed acquisition by the Board may, within 28 days after the service of a notice referred to in subsection (3), submit in writing to the Board precisely the grounds upon which he objects to the acquisition and the compensation offered by the Board.

> (5)    The Board shall consider the objection and may either disallow it or allow it either wholly or in part, and shall serve the owner or interested person by post or otherwise with a written notice of its decision.

> (6)    Any appeal by any owner or interested person aggrieved by the decision of the Board shall be made to the Minister within 28 days after the date of service of such decision on the owner or interested person and the decision of the Minister shall be final and not open to review or challenge on any ground whatsoever.

17     The accused did not object to nor did he appeal against the proposed acquisition and compensation sum by HDB as notified in the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8). PW6 Christopher Lim testified that even after serving HDB’s Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8) on the accused on 13 March 2013, HDB continued to engage the accused by way of letters and meetings. It was clearly documented in HDB’s letter dated 4 June 2014 to the accused (exhibit P10) that HDB had not received any written appeal against the compulsory acquisition of the flat and that the prescribed appeal period had since expired. HDB further stated in its letter dated 4 June 2014 (exhibit P10) that in order to prevent further accumulation of mortgage arrears, HDB would be proceeding with the vesting of the title of the flat in HDB. HDB also informed the accused in exhibit P10 that upon vesting of the title in HDB, he would no longer be the owner of the flat and a “Notice of Vesting” would be served on him and he would be required to vacate the flat within 30 days from the date of service of the Notice of Vesting. HDB noted in exhibit P10 that the accused had assured HDB that he would arrange for alternative accommodation on his own.

18     The accused “think” that he received HDB’s letter dated 4 June 2014 (exhibit P10)[^3]. He did not deny having told the HDB officer that he would find his own place to stay but said that it did not mean that he would do so[^4].

19     PW7 Celia Lee told the court that she took over as the case manager of the flat in 2017. Prior to her taking over the case, HDB had sent more than 20 letters to the accused regarding the mortgage arrears. In 2016, as documented in exhibit P16, a letter dated 17 March 2016 which HDB sent to the accused, HDB had scheduled an appointment with the accused on 25 February 2016 to discuss the loan arrears. Exhibit P16 noted that the accused had agreed to attend the meeting, but he failed to turn up and could not be reached on his mobile phone.

20     PW7 Celia Lee said that upon taking over the case, she visited the flat and in July 2017 she arranged to see the accused at the branch office where she met him for the first time. She said that the purpose of the meeting was to convince the accused to co-operate with HDB by letting HDB take back his flat and HDB would in turn help him to buy a smaller flat. PW7 Celia Lee said that during this meeting she showed the accused a copy of the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition dated 13 March 2013 (exhibit P8). At the meeting, she highlighted to the accused that it would be worthwhile for him to let HDB re-possess the flat because the compensation amount was higher than the flat’s market value. PW7 Celia Lee said she had a hard time getting through to the accused regarding the arrears and compulsory acquisition as the accused was not interested in what she had to tell him instead he preferred to harp on past issues such as his divorce and how he had failed to get justice.

21     PW7 Celia Lee told the court that after her meeting with the accused in July 2017, she continued to send letters to the accused. One such letter was a letter dated 12 June 2018 (exhibit P11), which referred to the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition dated 13 March 2013 (exhibit P8). PW7 Celia Lee informed the accused in exhibit P11 that his mortgage arrears had accumulated to $101,870 and that HDB would be proceeding to vest the title of the flat to prevent further arrears from accruing. She reminded him in exhibit P11 of the legal consequences that would ensue upon the flat vesting in HDB. In exhibit P11, she also urged the accused to attend at HDB branch office for a discussion on the matter.

22     Both PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee testified that the flat was vested in HDB on 2 August 2018. On 8 August 2018, HDB’s legal department served the Notice of Vesting which was titled “Notice to Take Possession Pursuant To S 59(1) Of The Housing And Development Act” (exhibit P9) on the accused by pasting it on the door of the flat, to inform him that the flat had been vested in HDB on 2 August 2018. The Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) also gave notice to the accused that HDB would be taking possession of the flat on the expiry of 30 days from 8 August 2018.

23     It would be noted that the accused wavered in his evidence as to whether he had received the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9). Initially, he said he “think” that he had received exhibit P9[^5]. He then changed his evidence and said that he was not sure if he had received exhibit P9[^6]. He later acknowledged that since the mode of service was stated in exhibit P9 as “Paste on Door”, exhibit P9 should have been pasted on the door and he would have taken it down although he might not have read it. His final position was that he did not remember P9 being pasted on the door and he might not have seen P9[^7]. Notwithstanding the accused’s disclaimers, PW7 Celia Lee testified that exhibit P9 was no longer on the front door when she and her colleague visited the flat subsequently.

24     In my view, the accused was being evasive when he vacillated as to whether he had received the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) or not. I accepted the evidence of PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee that the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) was pasted on his door and that the accused must have taken it down. It would be noted that s 83(1) of the Housing and Development Act provided that every notice required or authorised by the Act to be served on the owner of a flat shall be deemed to be sufficiently served if it was affixed to some conspicuous part of his flat.

25     The Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) required the accused to quit and deliver vacant possession of the flat and remove all furniture and belongings. The Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) also stated that all items found in the flat at the time of possession by HDB shall be deemed abandoned and HDB would dispose of them without reference to the accused.

26     Given the evidence above, the accused was clearly aware of HDB’s decision to compulsorily acquire the flat since the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition dated 13 March 2013 (exhibit P8) was served on him. Between 13 March 2013 until 2 August 2018 when the flat was vested in HDB, he did not appeal against HDB’s decision to compulsorily acquire the flat. On 8 August 2018, HDB served the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) on the accused. Pursuant to s 59(1) of the Housing and Development Act, HDB was therefore empowered to take possession of the flat with effect from 8 September 2018, on the expiry of 30 days after service of the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9). This meant that the accused had to vacate the flat by 7 September 2018.

### Overlapping events around 8 August 2018

27     For the avoidance of doubt, I thought I should also deal with certain overlapping events that occurred around the date of 8 August 2018 when the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) was served on the accused.

28     PW7 Celia Lee told the court that the accused called her around 7 or 8 August 2018 to say that he would like to settle the arrears and enquired about his loan balance. PW7 Celia Lee informed the accused on the telephone that HDB was in the process of vesting the title of the flat. She followed up on their telephone conversation with a letter dated 8 August 2018 (exhibit P12) to the accused wherein she furnished the figures on the outstanding payments owing on the flat and she reminded the accused that HDB was in the process of vesting the title of the flat. In this regard, we would recall that HDB was no longer in the process of vesting the title of the flat since the title of the flat had already vested in HDB on 2 August 2018 as stated in the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9).

29     Exhibit P12 dated 8 August 2018 would appear to have overlapped with the service of the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) on the door of the flat on 8 August 2018. PW7 Celia Lee testified that when she sent the letter in exhibit P12 on 8 August 2018 telling the accused that HDB was in the process of vesting the title of the flat, she did not know that the title of the flat had vested in HDB because the matter was handled by HDB’s legal department. Once PW7 Celia Lee came to know that the flat had already vested in HDB on 2 August 2018 and that the legal department had served the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) on the accused on 8 August 2018, she wrote to accused on 24 August 2018 (exhibit P13) and informed him that he would need to vacate the flat by 7 September 2018. She also wrote that if the accused needed assistance to look for alterative housing, he could contact her for further discussion. PW7 Celia Lee told the court that she did not hear from the accused.

30     The accused claimed that he did not receive PW7 Celia Lee’s letter dated 8 August 2018 (exhibit P12). As for PW7 Celia Lee’s letter dated 24 August 2018 (exhibit P13), initially when he was cross-examining PW7 Celia Lee, he said that he did not receive it. Later, when he was being cross-examined, he told the court that he was not sure if he had received the letter dated 24 August 2018 (exhibit P13).

31     In my view, it was inconsequential whether the accused had received PW7 Celia Lee’s letters in exhibits P12 and P13 or not. What was crucial was that the accused was aware of the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) which was pasted on his front door on 8 August 2018. In fact, he told the court that there had been “a lot of vesting going on since 2012”[^8]. The accused said after buying the flat in 2001, he lived there with his wife and two children. He and his wife divorced in 2006 and he was granted sole custody of his children. In 2012, his children left to be with their mother, so the accused lived alone in the flat. About that time, the accused said that one Khoo Tiong Tat from HDB informed his son that the flat was no longer in his name[^9]. He agreed that HDB had over the years sent him numerous letters regarding vesting and taking possession of his flat. He told the court that he had also received a letter from HDB in 2016 telling him to vacate the flat and at that time he had told his Member of Parliament that HDB could go ahead with it[^10]. He was therefore fully cognizant of HDB’s intention to compulsorily acquire his flat since 2012 and that he would have to vacate his flat.

### The story of the shouting wolf

32     Notwithstanding that I was satisfied on the evidence that HDB was legally empowered to take possession of the flat under s 59 of the Housing and Development Act, for completeness, I shall deal with the accused’s contention that HDB did not have the right to require him to vacate the flat. In my view, the accused was not justified in holding such a belief.

33     The accused acknowledged that he owed arrears to HDB and that HDB had been communicating with him over the years regarding the compulsory acquisition of the flat since 2012. He said that as HDB was merely sending him letters after letters without any “solid[^11]” action, he felt that HDB had lost its credibility, so he started to ignore HDB’s letters[^12]. He likened the situation to “the story of the shouting wolf” and said that he therefore no longer believed what was stated in HDB’s letters about “vesting” because it was never executed[^13]. When the accused talked about the story of the shouting wolf, I understood him to be saying that HDB had been giving him false alarms all these years regarding its intention to vest the title of the flat in HDB and to re-possess the flat, hence he saw no reason to trust HDB when it finally notified him that it had vested the title of the flat in HDB.

34     Aside from blaming HDB for dragging its feet and its inaction which led him to doubt HDB’s intentions and sincerity, he also claimed that part of the reason why he did not trust HDB was because Khoo Tiong Tat, the former HDB case manager of his flat, had not only met up with his ex-wife but he had also told the accused that the flat was a matrimonial home which meant that the accused would have to divide the proceeds of sale with his ex-wife. The accused felt that Khoo Tiong Tat was not only in a conflict of interest, but that Khoo Tiong Tat was also abusing his authority to influence other departments to get at the accused[^14]. The accused later lodged a police report against Khoo Tiong Tat. He also filed a Magistrate’s Complaint against Khoo Tiong Tat for harassment.

35     The accused claimed that another reason why he decided to hang onto the flat even though he knew he had to vacate the flat for not paying the arrears was because he was waiting for a “legal paper” to tell him how much compensation he would be getting. HDB was however not forthcoming with the “truth” about “the facts and figures” because HDB was “hiding something” with the “ulterior motive” that the accused would then have to split the sale proceeds with his ex-wife[^15].

36     PW6 Christopher Lim told the court that if any flat owner owed three months or more of mortgage payments, HDB would consider the flat owner to be in arrears and HDB would then try to help the flat owner with financial assistance schemes. In this case, HDB had originally worked out an instalment plan with the accused but the payments were not coming in. PW6 Christopher Lim testified that accused also promised HDB that he would sell the flat, but the sale did not materialise. PW6 Christopher Lim pointed out that the compensation sum of $418,500 was specified in the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition dated 13 March 2018 (exhibit P8). PW6 Christopher Lim said that eventually HDB had no alternative but to proceed with legal action to compulsorily acquire the flat when the accused had owed close to 10 years of arrears.

37     PW7 Celia Lee similarly explained that HDB had been slow to re-possess the flat because it was a last resort. She said that HDB would give the flat owners time and chances to settle the arrears which was what it did in this case. PW7 Celia Lee said that another reason why HDB took a longer time with this case was that HDB was waiting for the Magistrate’s Complaint which the accused filed against the former case manager Khoo Tiong Tat in 2015 to be settled before it proceeded with further action[^16]. At last, PW7 Celia Lee thought it was time “to end all this” and decided to proceed with the vesting process which she had rather not because vesting and eviction was a long and traumatic process. She found it amusing and unfair that the accused should turn around and fault HDB for taking a long time to re-possess his flat when what they had been doing was to giving him chances and time to co-operate with HDB to resolve the matter.

38     As regards the accused’s allegation that HDB had failed to provide him with the net compensation sum he would be entitled to receive, PW7 Celia Lee explained that HDB would only be able to crystalise the final figure after the title had vested in HDB. Prior to vesting, HDB could only furnish estimated computations[^17]. It would be noted that the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8) made it clear that the compensation sum would be offset against the accused’s outstanding mortgage loan and other liabilities in connection with the flat.

39     From the testimonies of PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee, it was evident that HDB had been forbearing towards the accused and granted him plenty of time and opportunities to try to resolve the arrears issue. From the Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition (exhibit P8), it was unmistakable that HDB had apprised the accused of the compensation amount he could expect. From exhibits P11, P12 and P15, letters sent by HDB to the accused, HDB had clearly informed the accused of the arrears he was owing. The accused could not provide any legitimate reason why HDB would harbour any ulterior motive towards him or why HDB was not trustworthy.

40     It would be noted that after HDB pasted the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) on the accused’s front door on 8 Aug 2018, HDB officers made at least 3 further visits to the flat on 10 September 2018, 18 October 2018 and 19 October 2018. The accused had been living alone in the flat since his children left with his ex-wife in September 2012. He claimed that he was only aware of two visits by HDB officers on 10 September and 19 October 2018 whereby they knocked on his door and when he kept silent because he saw no point in saying anything, the officers turned off his electricity power supply. He told the court that he lodged police reports arising from both incidents.

41     PW7 Celia Lee testified that she and a colleague paid two visits to the flat in September 2018 to confirm if the accused was still living there. On one of the visits which was carried out at night, they heard noise coming from the flat. They knocked on the door and called out the accused’s name but there was no response. PW7 Celia Lee then decided to turn off the electric metre as she figured that since it was late at night, if there were any occupant, the occupant would emerge from the flat if there were no electricity. PW7 Celia Lee saw nothing wrong in switching off the power supply to check if anyone was still living in the flat since the flat belonged to HDB due to the re-vesting[^18]. After turning off the electricity power supply, she and her colleague went off and returned half an hour later to discover that the accused had summoned the police to the scene. The two police officers whom PW7 Celia Lee met showed her an image of the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) which the accused apparently sent to the police. As such, PW7 Celia Lee requested the police officers to convince the accused to open the door and come out for a chat. The police officer called the accused on the spot, but the accused declined to communicate with PW7 Celia Lee. At the suggestion of the police officers, PW7 Celia Lee and her colleague then left the premises[^19]. As for the second occasion on 19 October 2018 where the electricity power supply to the flat was turned off, PW7 Celia Lee clarified that she was not present, and it was another colleague who did it.

42     It would be pertinent to note that after the first occasion on 18 September 2018 where the electricity power supply to the flat was turned off, HDB served a Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) on the accused by pasting it on the door on 18 October 2018. The next day, on 19 October 2018, the accused encountered the second occasion where his electricity power supply was turned off. The point about these visits by HDB officers in September and October 2018 and their actions in turning off the electricity power supply to the flat was nonetheless lost on the accused. By 19 October 2018 particularly since the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) had been served on him on 18 October 2018, it would be apparent that HDB was taking serious measures to repossess the flat. Regrettably, the accused disregarded the gravity of the matter and paid no heed to the firm actions of HDB.

### Notice of scheduled eviction on 24 October 2018

43     PW7 Celia Lee testified that after confirming that the accused was still living in the flat from the two visits she made in September 2018, on 18 October 2018 at about 5pm, she went to the flat and personally pasted a Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) on the door to notify the accused that HDB would be evicting him on 24 Oct 2018 at 10am.

44     In court, the accused at first claimed that he had not seen the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (P14) before. His claim was however, contradicted by the police report he lodged on 31 May 2019 (exhibit P17) where he specifically stated in the police report that “\[t\]hey had pasted the eviction order on the main door of my unit stating that they will be returning on the 24 October 2018 to evict me out of the house”. His police report clearly indicated that that he had seen the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) previously. The accused tried to explain it away by saying that his police report was filed after the eviction by which time the accused had learned about the Notice of Scheduled Eviction dated 18 October 2018 (exhibit P14).

45     I did not find his explanation convincing. The accused had recounted the events in his police report dated 31 May 2019 (exhibit P17) in a chronological order, starting from the disputes he had with HDB since 2012. From the way the accused described the sequence of events in his police report, it was clear that he knew the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) was pasted on his front door on 18 October 2018 and he also knew that HDB was planning to evict him on 24 October 2018. If it were true that the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) was not pasted on his door on 18 October 2018, he would have detailed it as such in his police report dated 31 May 2019 (exhibit P17). Further, if it were true that he only came to know about the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) after the eviction, he could have simply told the court that he only saw or knew about the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) after the eviction. Instead he denied having ever seen the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14).

46     It was also telling that when the Prosecution confronted the accused with his police report dated 31 May 2019 (exhibit P17) and put it to him that he had not been truthful when he told the court that he had not seen the Notice of Scheduled Eviction (P14) till now, the accused did not refute the allegation but he replied, “if you say so[^20].” Therefore the accused knew beforehand from the Notice of Scheduled Eviction dated 18 October 2018 (exhibit P14) that HDB was going to evict him on 24 October 2018.

### Actus reus of the HDB charge

47     The Prosecution had established that HDB was empowered to take possession of the flat under s 59 of the Housing and Development Act. It next had to prove the actus reus of the HDB charge by showing that the accused had obstructed PW6 Christopher Lim in the performance of taking possession of the flat by refusing to open the gate despite (i) having been served a notice that HDB would be taking possession of the flat and (ii) being requested by PW6 Christopher Lim to open the gate and vacate the flat.

48     The Prosecution had already shown that HDB served the Notice of Vesting/Notice to Take Possession dated 8 August 2018 (exhibit P9) on the accused and that the accused knew about the scheduled eviction on 24 October 2018. The question then was whether PW6 Christopher Lim had requested the accused to open the gate and vacate the flat during the scheduled eviction on 24 October 2018 and whether the accused had obstructed PW6 Christopher Lim in the performance of taking possession of the flat by refusing to open the gate despite PW6 Christopher Lim’s requests.

49     It would be relevant at this juncture to look at what happened during the scheduled eviction on 24 October 2018 in connection with the HDB charge. The evidence was as summarised below.

#### The evidence of the Prosecution witnesses

50     PW6 Christopher Lim testified that on 24 October 2018, he together with another 10 HDB officers including PW7 Celia Lee, three auxiliary policemen, two locksmiths as well as “assistance” from the Social Services Centre (“HDB eviction team”) arrived at the flat. PW6 Christopher Lim estimated that they reached the flat at about 9.30am while PW7 Celia Lee said they got there at around 10am. According to the accused’s court testimony and police report in exhibit P17, he was sleeping when he heard noises coming from the metal gate of the flat at about 10am. The Notice of Scheduled Eviction (exhibit P14) stated that the eviction on 24 October 2018 would be carried out at 10am. As such I was inclined to believe that the eviction team arrived at the flat at the appointed time of 10am.

51     PW6 Christopher Lim told the court that physical eviction was very rare as 99% of the flat owners would voluntarily “return” the flat to HDB when they could not cope with the arrears. HDB anticipated that this would be a challenging case because it knew that the accused would be reluctant to vacate the flat. It was also concerned that the accused might choose to jump from the flat or create other problems so it decided to gather more people on standby for deployment purposes should there be unforeseen circumstances. PW6 Christopher Lim clarified that another reason why so many people were activated was that after the eviction, the team would need to take an inventory of the items in the flat and more manpower meant that the job could be completed faster.

52     PW6 Christopher Lim said that they knocked on the accused’s door but there was no response. There were three padlocks securing the metal gate, so instructions were given to the locksmith to cut the padlocks. When the locksmith was cutting the last padlock, the accused opened the front door at which point the locksmith stopped what he was doing. This was the first time PW6 Christopher Lim met the accused. He identified himself as a HDB officer and told the accused the purpose for their being there. PW6 Christopher Lim explained to the accused that he owed mortgage arrears, that the Notice of Vesting /Notice to Take Possession (exhibit P9) had been served and that the accused was supposed to vacate the flat. PW6 Christopher Lim assured the accused that compensation would be paid and they would arrange for alternative accommodation if the accused had nowhere to stay.

53     PW6 Christopher Lim testified that he requested the accused to open the gate and vacate the flat however the accused replied that he was not going to do so and refused to open the gate or vacate the flat. The accused was quite agitated and he was holding on to his mobile phone and telling PW6 Christopher Lim that he was putting them on Facebook Live while giving a running commentary that a group of people was there to break into his house and take his things. The accused also mentioned to PW6 Christopher Lim that the letters and notices served on him were false and that he did not believe anything that he received. PW6 Christopher Lim said that the accused then called for the police and the police arrived shortly.

54     PW7 Celia Lee corroborated PW6 Christopher Lim’s evidence as to what happened when the HDB eviction team arrived at the flat at about 10am on 24 October 2018. She testified that they knocked on the door but there was no response. There were three padlocks on the metal gate and one locksmith started to cut the locks. PW7 Celia Lee said that the accused opened the door when the locksmith was cutting the last padlock. PW6 Christopher Lim then came forward to remind the accused that the title of the flat had vested in HDB and they were there to recover vacant possession of the flat. She said that PW6 Christopher Lim requested the accused to open the gate and vacate the flat, but the accused refused to co-operate with them. The accused insisted that the notices issued to him were fake and he demanded to see an order of court. He started to film them with his mobile phone. He also called the police. Likewise, the HDB eviction team also called for police assistance and the police soon arrived.

55     Both PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 similarly testified that when the police arrived at the scene, the police officers tried to persuade the accused to open the gate, but the accused would not listen to their advice. PW7 Celia Lee told the court that when the locksmith wanted to resume cutting the padlock, the accused turned “more aggressive” whereupon he took a bicycle part from inside the flat and banged it against the gate. The accused even went to cover the padlock with his bare hand[^21].

56     Eventually the police officers decided to restrain the accused by physically pulling him against the gate thus enabling the locksmith to finish cutting the last padlock. The police then opened the gate, pulled the accused out of the flat and pinned him to the ground and placed him under arrest. The standoff between the accused, the HDB eviction team and the police ended around 11am when the accused was arrested (see arrest report exhibit P3).

#### The evidence of the accused

57     According to the accused, at about 10am on 24 October 2018, he awoke to the noise of metal being sawn. When he opened the door, he saw that the locksmith had almost finished cutting his second padlock and that there were many people outside his gate. At that moment, he felt very frightened. He happened to have a bicycle frame without tyres in the flat, so he took hold of it and shoved it towards the lock to prevent the locksmith from cutting it and the locksmith retreated from the gate as a result.

58     The accused told the court that he saw PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee outside his flat and knew that they were from HDB[^22]. He agreed that they told him that they were there to take possession of the flat[^23]. He did not dispute that PW6 Christopher Lim asked him to open the gate. While he contended that he had no chance to open the gate since the locksmith was already cutting his padlocks, he conceded that there was nothing to stop him from getting the key to the third padlock and unlocking it[^24]. The accused said that he was not prepared to vacate the flat hence he refused to accede to PW6 Christopher Lim’s requests to open the gate and leave the flat[^25]. He also admitted that he placed his hand over the third padlock to prevent the locksmith from cutting it.

#### The court’s findings

59     From the evidence above, it was clear that PW6 Christopher Lim had requested the accused to open the gate and to vacate the flat but the accused not only refused to open the gate, he also tried to prevent the HDB eviction team from forcibly entering the flat by going so far as to risk injuries to himself by placing his hand over the padlock to prevent the locksmith from cutting it. The accused had clearly obstructed PW6 Christopher Lim from taking possession of the flat.

60     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the actus reus of the HDB charge beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Mens rea of the HDB charge

61     For the mens rea element of the charge, the Prosecution would have to show that the accused intended to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim from taking possession of the flat.

62     The Prosecution informed the court that there was no local case law regarding the mens rea requirement under s 79 of the Housing and Development Act and that the Parliamentary Debates did not help[^26]. It therefore drew guidance from the High Court decision of _Foo Siang Wah Frederick v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 996</span> (“_Frederick Foo_”) on the applicable mens rea for the HDB charge. In _Frederick Foo_, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) discussed the mens rea requirements under s 26(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) for an offence of hindering investigations by officers of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) and s 186 of the Penal Code for an offence of obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his duties. The Prosecution submitted that the mens rea for the HDB charge should be aligned with the highly similar offences discussed in _Frederick Foo_ and that the proper scope of the mens rea for the HDB charge was intention, knowledge or reason to believe as follows[^27]:

> (a)     that the accused intended by his actions to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim in the performance of taking possession of the flat; or

> (b)     that the accused knew that he was by his actions likely to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim, whom he knew to be in the performance of taking possession of the flat; or

> (c)     that the accused had reason to believe that he was by his actions likely to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim, whom he had reason to believe was in the performance of taking possession of the flat;

63     Yong CJ held at \[55\] of _Frederick Foo_ that what was important was the state of the mind of the offender as to the effect or consequence of his actions and not so much his state of mind with respect to the doing of the act itself. In _Frederick Foo_, Yong CJ found that the only purpose the offender could have intended or knew he was likely to achieve by his act of tipping off a suspect must have been to make it more difficult for the CPIB to carry out its investigations because there was no other way in which the offender could explain his advice to the suspect to destroy certain incriminating evidence.

64     In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that the only purpose the accused could have intended to achieve must have been to make it more difficult for PW6 Christopher Lim to take possession of the flat and therefore he had intended to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim in the performance of taking possession of the flat.

65     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions. In my view, there was no doubt that the accused intended to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim in the performance of taking possession of the flat. The accused admitted that he refused to co-operate with PW6 Christopher Lim to open the gate. In fact, he said that he intentionally did not open the gate in order to prevent PW6 Christopher Lim from taking possession of the flat because he doubted the legality of the eviction[^28]. He added that he refused to move out because it was his home and that he was protecting his property[^29]. Since the accused had no intention to let PW6 Christopher Lim take possession of the flat, he must have intended to obstruct PW6 in the performance of taking possession of the flat. At the very least, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused must have known or had reason to believe that by refusing to co-operate with PW6 Christopher Lim that he was likely to obstruct PW6 Christopher Lim from taking possession of the flat.

66     As regards the accused’s allegation that the eviction was illegal, I have already dealt with this issue above and found that HDB was empowered to take possession of the flat pursuant to s 59 of the Housing and Development Act.

67     I therefore found that the Prosecution had proven the mens rea of the HDB charge beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Conclusion on the HDB charge

68     For the foregoing reasons, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that on 24th day of October 2018, sometime between 9.30am and 11.00am, the accused had obstructed PW6 Christopher Lim, an officer of HDB, in the performance of the taking possession of the flat, which HDB was empowered to do under section 59(1) of the Housing and Development Act.

## The Penal Code charge

69     The offence in the Penal Code charge was committed when the police officers decided to restrain the accused after he tried to prevent the locksmith from cutting the padlock by placing his hand over it. The accused admitted that he had punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s hand several times but claimed that he was acting in self-defence. In this regard, there were a few disputed issues. The main issue was whether the accused was acting in self-defence when he punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim). The other issues were whether the accused had punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) on his left forearm or his hand and whether the accused had shoved a bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) during the incident.

70     I set out below the material evidence leading to the commission of this offence.

### The evidence of the Prosecution Witnesses

71     On 24 October 2018, PW3 Inspector Paul Singh who was the team leader on duty at Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre in Ang Mo Kio Police Division was alerted through an email that HDB would be attending to an eviction at the flat that morning and had requested for police assistance. Accordingly PW3 Inspector Paul Singh briefed his team about HDB’s email request. It would be noted that s 59(2) of the Housing and Development Act empowered HDB to take such measures as were necessary including calling for police assistance to have the occupants evicted and to enforce the surrender of the flat and to remove the things found therein.

72     At about 10.02am, the accused made a 999 call (“First Information Report”) and reported that someone using a saw was trying to break into his house and the incident location was the same address as the HDB eviction unit. In response to the First Information Report (“FIR”), PW3 Inspector Paul Singh despatched PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing and her partner PW5 SC Sergeant Ng Tze Liang as the first response officers to the flat. The accused’s FIR is re-produced below.

> Someone trying to break into my house. The person is not known to me. I’m at home now but I can’t see the person. The person is using some kind of saw or something. Please come now.

73     PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing testified that when she arrived at the scene with PW5 SC Sergeant Ng Tze Liang, they saw that the door of the flat was opened, the metal gate was locked, and the accused was standing inside the flat behind the gate. PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing went up to the accused and ascertained that he was the person who made the 999 call. She asked the accused to open the gate and let them enter so that they could find out what happened, but the accused refused and insisted that they produced a court order before he would let them in. One HDB officer then approached PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing, identified himself and explained to her the situation. He said that the accused refused to let them enter the flat to evict him for failure to pay the mortgage loan. The HDB officer also showed PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing a notice of eviction.

74     PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing was wearing a Body Worn Camera (“BWC”) that day. The video footage (exhibit P4) retrieved from her BWC showed that she arrived at the flat at around 10:22:38am. The video footage was played in court during her re-examination. From the video footage, it appeared that there were some minor discrepancies in PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing’s oral evidence and what was captured on her BWC. From the video footage, it could be seen that the HDB officer had approached PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing first to give her the background information after which she went to speak to the accused and not the other way round as she had testified.

75     Meanwhile, PW3 Inspector Paul Singh decided to go down to the scene with another two police officers, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) and Senior Inspector Imran to see if the first response officers needed help. When they reached the flat, PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing updated PW3 Inspector Paul Singh that the accused would not open the gate neither was the accused receptive to any conversation.

76     It would be noted from the video footage (exhibit P4) that PW3 Inspector Paul Singh was at the scene by 10:24am. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh then spoke with the HDB officers and verified that they were the people mentioned in the email from HDB who were there to carry out the eviction. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh recalled the HDB officers showing him a notice of eviction. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh testified that since the matter could not be resolved amicably, he told the HDB officers to go ahead and cut the padlock. From the video footage (exhibit P4), PW3 Inspector Paul Singh could be seen and heard at timestamp 10:24:50am telling the HDB officers that they could proceed to cut the last padlock.

77     Despite PW3 Inspector Paul Singh telling the HDB officers that they could proceed to cut the padlock, the locksmiths were unable to do so as the accused would not let the locksmiths cut the padlock. The accused even put one hand over the padlock to prevent the locksmiths from accessing it while he filmed the process with his mobile phone in his other hand and telling the police that he was on Facebook live. PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing said that they tried to show the accused the notice of eviction, but the accused refused to look at the document and insisted on a court order[^30]. PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) testified that the police officers told the accused that if he did not want to step out of the flat, necessary force or arrest would be made but the accused did not bother about the warnings[^31]. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh could also be heard telling the accused in the video footage (exhibit P6) retrieved from his BWC at timestamp 10:38:50am to 10:39:20am to open the gate and that legally the house was not his now, but the accused remained unreceptive and uncooperative. He demanded that PW3 Inspector Paul Singh produced a legal paper.

78     By this time, the police officers had interacted with the accused for at least 15 minutes, but there was no progress. Based on the email sent by HDB to the management of Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre, the documentation which the HDB officers showed the police officers at the scene which included correspondence sent to the accused on delayed payments and the fact that the accused refused to leave the premises, the police officers “concluded” that the accused was committing criminal trespass under s 447 of the Penal Code. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh clarified that eviction was a matter between the accused and HDB but if the eviction could not be done amicably, the police would have to intervene as its role was to maintain law and order. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh told the court that the situation then was indeed chaotic.

79     PW3 Inspector Paul Singh decided that the next best course of action would be to restrain the accused by holding onto his arms so that the locksmith could cut the padlock without injuring the accused. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh was concerned that the accused would get hurt if his hands came into contact with the high-power saw that the locksmith was using[^32]. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh was also worried about the safety of the locksmith and his police officers[^33]. He was then preparing to place the accused under arrest for criminal trespass.

80     When the opportunity arose, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) signalled to PW3 Inspector Paul Singh to synchronise and go for the accused’s arms. At that time, the accused was holding his mobile phone in his left hand. PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was standing on the right side of the gate while PW3 Inspector Paul Singh was standing on the left side of the gate as they faced the accused. PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) used both his hands to grab the accused’s left elbow while PW3 Inspector Paul Singh grabbed hold of the accused’s right forearm. As the padlock was located on the right side of the gate as one faced the flat, the plan was to pull the accused’s arms to the left, away from the padlock to create safe space for the locksmith to cut the padlock. The accused somehow managed to break his right arm free from PW3 Inspector Paul Singh’s grip. PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) had earlier noticed a bicycle frame (without tyres and handlebars) leaning against the gate and other small objects lying around, he was afraid that the accused who was clearly agitated might pick up the bicycle frame or the other objects and throw the items at them. He therefore decided not to let go of the accused’s left arm.

81     PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) testified that consequently the accused forcefully pulled his arms into the flat through the gaps in the gate while PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was holding tightly onto the accused’s left arm. The video footage (exhibit P2) at the 10:39:31am and 10:39:33am timestamps showed how PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s body which was not in contact with the gate when he first reached out to grab the accused’s left arm was then pulled against the gate within two seconds[^34].

82     PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) told the court that after the accused pulled PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arms into the flat, the accused used his free right fist to punch PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left forearm four to five times forcefully. The accused next picked up the bicycle frame with his free right hand and shoved it towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim). The bicycle frame came into contact with PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm and elbow causing it to go numb. That was when PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) decided to let go of the accused’s left arm before he sustained further injuries. PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) clarified that the shove was not really hard, and he suffered scratches as a result[^35].

83     The first attempt by PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) and PW3 Inspector Paul Singh to grab the accused’s arms occurred between 10:39:30am to 10:39:40am. This episode including the assault by the accused on PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was caught on the BWCs of PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing, PW3 Inspector Paul Singh and PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim). The Prosecution had extracted the relevant video footages between 10:38:40am to 10:42:30am (exhibits P2, P6 and P7) and they were played in court.

84     The first attempt by the police officers to restrain the accused failed due to poor co-ordination. After the first failed attempt during which the accused punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm, PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing could be heard in the video footage (exhibit P2) at timestamp 10:39:41am telling the accused to stop it and to co-operate with the police otherwise the police would have to do things the “harsh way”. PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing also told the accused that they did not want to hurt him, but the accused kept insisting for court papers and refused to open the gate.

85     After the first failed attempt, the police officers were better co-ordinated the second time. They waited for the right timing. At this point, the accused had climbed onto the gate. As could be seen from the video footages (exhibits P2, P6 and P7) at timestamp 10:41:06am, the police officers managed to grab hold of the accused’s arms and held the accused against the gate while the locksmith seized the chance to cut the last padlock. The police officers then opened the gate and tried to pull the accused out of the flat, but the accused clung onto the gate and the police officers had to exert efforts to bring him down. The accused continued to put up a struggle and the police officers had to drag him out of the flat and held him down on the ground. They then handcuffed him and placed him under arrest for criminal trespass, voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant and obstructing duties of a public servant as stated in the arrest report in exhibit P3 lodged by PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing on the same day at about 11.38am. The second successful attempt to restrain the accused up to his arrest was captured in the video footages (exhibits P2, P6 and P7).

86     PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) went to the Emergency Department at Sengkang General Hospital on the same day at about 2.06pm and was given one day’s medical leave. As a result of the punches from the accused on his left arm, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) suffered a 3 cm hematoma (ie swelling) on his distal left forearm (ie lower end of the left forearm) with patches (ie redness on the skin) as stated in the medical report (exhibit P5). PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) also sustained injuries on his right hand like bruises and red patches which he attributed to other causes such as the scuffle when he was effecting arrest on the accused.

### The evidence of the accused

87     The accused’s version was that he was being held, grabbed and pulled through the gate and as a normal human being, he had to protect himself and not let the police officers break his hands. He had stepped up onto the gate to record “live video”. He was therefore “above the gate” when the police officers were pulling his hands out and not thinking of his safety. He complained that what they did was very dangerous because they could break his arms due to his weight and he was dangling at the gate. He said that he did not have to know whose hand it was but as a reflex action he had to “release” himself and he “just punch it” so that he could retract his arm from the gate otherwise if they were to pull his arms, they would break his bones. He said that he was basically protecting himself from more serious injury. He admitted during his cross-examination that he had used his right hand to punch PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s hand a few times because PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was gripping his left hand and it was painful[^36]. During his cross-examination, the accused also said that PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) asked for it by attacking him.

88     The accused told the court that when the police officers pulled him against the gate, he was slammed against the metal part of the gate which “holds the locks” and it punched his ribs. He also said that the police officers were pressing his hand and using commando technique because it was very painful, and he could be seen screaming in pain in the video footages. He said he was being attacked by at least four young police officers who were using strength and pressing and pulling his arms and slamming him against the gate. As such he could only “hit the hand … just to release” himself from sustaining more injury.

89     The accused testified that he was in jail for 16 days before he was bailed out. During his remand period, he was taking painkillers and medication. He was still unwell when he was out on bail and he had to go to the emergency department regarding his chest pain. He told the doctor what happened and how he got injured. His X-ray was taken, and the doctor said that his “fracture” would heal but it could not be shown in the X-ray. In this regard, the accused did not tender any documentation of the injuries he sustained during the eviction on 24 October 2018.

90     The accused said that in January 2019, he underwent a heart bypass surgery. His mother aged 87 was admitted to hospital on 4 January 2019 and she passed away on 10 January 2019. The accused blamed his mother’s death on “their action”. He said that she died because she could not stand the pain he was going through such as his heart bypass and his house being taken away.

### PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie was a public servant, in the discharge of his duty as a public servant

91     On the evidence before me, there was no doubt that PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie who was in his police uniform was discharging his duty as a public servant at the material time. He went to the flat on the instructions of his supervisor, PW3 Inspector Paul Singh, to respond to the accused’s 999 call that morning as well as to render assistance to HDB if necessary. When he grabbed hold of the accused’s left arm, he did so on PW3 Inspector Paul Singh’s directions for two reasons. First, it was to prevent the accused from putting his hand over the padlock while the locksmith used a power saw to cut the padlock, to ensure the safety of the accused, the police officers and the locksmith. Secondly, it was to place the accused under arrest for an offence of criminal trespass under s 447 of the PC.

92     S 64(1)(a) of the CPC provided that a police officer may arrest without a warrant, any person who had been concerned in an arrestable offence or was reasonably suspected of having been involved in one. S 447 of the PC was an arrestable offence under the First Schedule to the CPC. I accepted that there was reasonable cause to believe that the accused had committed the offence of criminal trespass. Besides, the police officers were justified under s 59(2) of the Housing and Development Act to render necessary assistance to HDB during the eviction.

### The accused had voluntarily caused hurt to PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie by punching his left arm multiple times

93     The applicable provision on the right of private defence at the material time was s 99 of the PC which provided as follows:

> (1)    There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by law.

> ….

> (2)    The right of private defence in no case extends to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence.

94     On the facts of the case, I was of the view that the accused was not entitled to rely on the right of private defence because such a right did not arise.

95     It was clear from the testimonies of the four police officers namely PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing, PW3 Inspector Paul Singh, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) and PW5 SC Sergeant Ng Tze Liang and the video footages (exhibits P2, P6 and P7) that there were 2 separate instances or attempts whereby the police officers grabbed hold of the accused’s arms. The first attempt was where PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) and PW3 Inspector Paul Singh moved in to grab the accused’s arms but they failed to restrain him and it occurred between 10:39:30am and 10:39:40am. It was during the first failed attempt that the accused punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm. The second successful attempt involved more police officers and it occurred between 10:41:06am to 10:42:30am. However, the accused had combined the two attempts or instances into one incident when he testified about the Penal Code charge.

96     As evident from the video footage (exhibit P2), in the first attempt, the accused was not standing in an elevated position. During his cross-examination, the accused agreed that he only “elevated” himself at about 10:40:32am, which was after the first attempt had taken place[^37]. Also, in the first attempt, only two police officers were involved in grabbing his arms namely PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) and PW3 Inspector Paul Singh. The accused was not “being attacked by at least four young police officers” as he had alleged. Further, in the first attempt, as evident from the video footages (exhibits P2, P6 and P7) between 10:39:30am to 10:39:40am, the accused was not screaming in pain. Up to that point, he could be seen to be highly agitated and aggressive, consistent with what PW3 Inspector Paul Singh told the court, that the accused was “hostile to the presence of the police” from the beginning[^38].

97     It was significant that the accused’s oral evidence in respect of the Penal Code charge was also materially different from the account he had given in his police report dated 31 May 2019 (exhibit P17). In his police report, he stated that one police officer suddenly pulled his left hand and caused him to slam his left ribs area against the gate but he did not mention that he was standing in a raised position when this happened. In his police report, he also stated that another police officer grabbed onto his left bicep area thereby causing him hurt which led him to use his right hand to hit the hand which was grabbing his bicep but he did not mention anything about the commando techniques of the police officers which made him scream in pain and fear that they might break his arms. Clearly, the accused had embellished his evidence in court as to what happened during the first attempt when PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) and PW3 Inspector Paul Singh tried to restrain him.

98     It was therefore clear that when the accused pulled PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arms into his flat, he was not in the “dangerous” situation that he described himself to be in, dangling above the gate, outnumbered and at risk of having his arms broken. It was also important to note that when the accused pulled PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arms into his flat, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was the only police officer holding onto the accused because the accused had earlier managed to free his right arm from PW3 Inspector Paul Singh’s grip. Crucially, it would be noted that at the time when the accused used his free right fist to punch PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm, all that PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was doing was merely using both his hands to hold on tightly to the accused’s left arm. PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was clearly not doing anything which would have reasonably caused the accused to have apprehension of death or of grievous hurt. In truth, it was the accused who was inflicting pain on PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) by punching PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) on his left arm.

99     Given the circumstances above, I found that no right of private defence arose for the accused under s 99 of the PC.

100    I noted that the accused disagreed that he pulled PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arms into his flat through the openings in the gate. He claimed that it was PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) who “pulled himself” into the flat while the accused was “retracting” his left arm to loosen PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s grip on it. Even if I were to accept that the accused pulled PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arms into his flat as a result of his struggle to break free from PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s grip, I was of the view that no right of private defence arose on the facts because PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was only holding on to the accused’s left arm and not doing anything which would reasonably cause the accused to have apprehension of death or of grievous hurt.

101    In any event, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s act of punching PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arm several times was wholly disproportionate and would have exceeded any right of private defence. From the video footage (exhibit P2) around timestamp 10:39:40am, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) could be seen holding his injured left arm in pain after the accused had punched it[^39]. PW7 Celia Lee had also witnessed PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) shaking his hand as if he had been injured[^40].

#### Whether the accused punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left forearm or hand

102    PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence was that the accused punched him on his left forearm forcefully for four to five times. The accused told the court that he punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) on the back of his hand and not the arm[^41].

103    PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence that the accused had punched him on his left forearm was corroborated by four other witnesses. PW3 Inspector Paul Singh witnessed the accused using his fist to punch PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s forearm several times although he could not recall which fist the accused used and which of PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s forearm the accused punched[^42]. In fact, PW3 Inspector Paul Singh told the court that he heard the sound of the punches as they landed on PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arm[^43]. PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing said that she saw PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) being pulled into the flat and she also saw the accused using his right fist which was holding a mobile phone to punch PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arm more than once to break free from PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s grip. She could not recall which of PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arm the accused hit[^44]. PW5 SC Sergeant Ng Tze Liang saw the accused pulling PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s arms into the flat and “hitting” or “hammering” PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm. PW6 Christopher Lim who was standing behind the police officers beside the gate also saw the accused using his fist to hit one of the police officer’s forearm to get the police officer to release his grip on the accused[^45]. Aside from the eyewitnesses’ accounts, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence that he was punched on his left forearm was also substantiated by his medical report (exhibit P5). I therefore accepted PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence that it was his left forearm that the accused punched.

#### Whether the accused shoved the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)

104    The accused denied shoving the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim). Since the BWCs were placed on the police officers’ shoulders, the video footages (exhibits P2, P6 and P7) did not capture what was happening at the floor level inside the accused’s flat. It was therefore necessary to examine the other evidence to determine whether the accused had shoved the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim).

105    Both PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing and PW3 Inspector Paul Singh did not testify about the bicycle frame. PW5 SC Sergeant Ng Tze Liang could not recall seeing a bicycle frame in the flat. Notwithstanding, it was not in dispute that the bicycle frame without tyres and handlebars existed as the accused testified that it was inside the flat that day. The dispute was whether the accused had shoved the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) after he had punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm.

106    On the evidence adduced before me, I was inclined to believe PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence that the accused, after punching PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left forearm also shoved the bicycle frame towards him. We would remember PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) telling the court that he had seen objects including the bicycle frame lying around inside the flat and he was fearful that the accused might use these items as missiles against the police officers so he was determined not to let go of the accused’s left arm although he was being punched on his left forearm. In my view, this would explain why the accused had to resort to shoving the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) to compel PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) to let go of the accused’s left arm. Indeed, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) released the accused’s left arm after the accused shoved the bicycle frame towards him for fear of sustaining more injuries.

107    PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence regarding the bicycle frame was also consistent with the evidence of PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee who saw the accused shoving a bicycle frame at the gate after the arrival of the police. PW6 Christopher Lim recalled that when the police officers were trying to talk to the accused, the accused took a bicycle frame from beside the gate and used it to hit the gate to prevent the police from carrying out any action. Thereafter, PW6 Christopher Lim said that the police decided to hold on to the accused while the locksmith cut the lock [^46]. PW7 Celia Lee testified that it was after the police arrived and the locksmith tried to cut the padlock that the accused became aggressive and he took a bicycle frame and “banged” it against the gate[^47]. PW7 Celia Lee only saw the accused picking up the bicycle frame once. At that time, PW7 Celia Lee could not see what was happening inside the flat[^48].

108    According to the accused, he had picked up the bicycle frame and shoved it towards the padlock the moment he opened his door and saw the locksmith cutting it. Having regard to PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee’s evidence, I found that it was more likely that the bicycle frame episode occurred when the police officers were standing outside the gate and not when the accused first awoke and opened the door. In the light of PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence, it was also possible that after the accused shoved the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) which came into contact with PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm, it hit the gate as witnessed by PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee. There was objective evidence of sounds coming from metal objects in the video footages (exhibits P2, P6 and P7) between timestamp 10:39:30am and 10:39:40am during which the accused punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) on his left arm which would be consistent with PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s evidence. In any event, it was not material whether it was the same occurrence or not. What was more important was whether the accused had shoved the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim).

109    In my view, there was no reason for PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) to lie about the bicycle frame. His evidence was also supported by his medical report (exhibit P5) where it was documented that he had told the examining doctor (Dr Annita Annatudeai) on the same day on 24 October 2018 at 2.06pm that “he was assaulted by one suspect by bicycle frame and punched on both hands.” The medical report was prepared by PW2 Dr Lau Hong Khai based on Dr Annita Annatudeai’s case notes since Dr Annita Annatudeai was on leave.

110    In this regard, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) clarified that he had told the examining doctor (Dr Annita Annatudeai) that he was punched by the suspect on his left hand and not both hands as stated in his medical report (exhibit P5). PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was clearly being fair to the accused when he clarified and confirmed that the accused only punched him on his left arm and did not directly cause the other injuries found on PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s right arm.

111    For the above reasons, I accepted that the accused shoved the bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim).

#### Whether the police officers used excessive force

112    I thought I should also make some observations regarding the two attempts by the police officers to restrain the accused. From the testimonies of the witnesses at the scene which were substantiated by the video footages (exhibits P2, P6 and P7), I found that the police officers had used necessary force and not excessive force to restrain and subdue the accused. There were two police officers involved in the first attempt and they failed to restrain the accused. Instead, PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was assaulted by the accused. For the second attempt, as could be seen from the video footages, it took four to five police officers to hold on to the accused’s hands against the gate as he put up a strong struggle and it also took considerable efforts before the police officers were able to bring the accused out of the flat and pin him to the ground before handcuffing him. I accepted that only necessary force was used.

### Conclusion on the Penal Code charge

113    In conclusion, the accused knew that punching someone would cause hurt to the person and he had intentionally punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)[^49]. In the circumstances, since no right of private defence arose, and in view of my findings above, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that on the 24th day of October 2018, at or about 10.39am, the accused had committed an offence under s 332 of the PC by voluntarily causing hurt to PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) by punching PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm multiple times while he was in the discharge of his duty as such public servant.

## Credibility of the Prosecution witnesses and the accused

114    For completeness, I would like to briefly touch on the credibility of the Prosecution witnesses and the accused. I found the HDB Prosecution witnesses to be credible witnesses whose testimonies were substantiated by documentary evidence. I also found the police officers who testified to be truthful witnesses whose evidence was corroborated by objective evidence in the video footages. In contrast, the accused was not a reliable witness. His evidence was internally and externally inconsistent. He not only gave shifting evidence in court, his testimony was materially different from his police report dated 31 May 2019 and at variance with the objective evidence in the video footages.

## Other allegations raised by the accused

115    I should mention that the accused tendered a one page handwritten closing submissions where he alleged that this was a case of “abetment”, “criminal conspiracy”, “conflict of interest”, “abuse and misuse of authority and power”, “harassment”, “violently causing grievous hurt”, “violation of privacy and confidentiality” against him. He also made specific allegations some of which he had raised during the trial. For example, he alleged that HDB tried to make him sell his flat so that HDB could channel half of the sale proceeds to the “sweet damsel in distress” (ie his ex-wife). He also alleged that HDB had broken into his flat on the eviction day on 24 October 2018 and destroyed evidence by deleting the SD card of his camera. He further claimed that he landed in hospital due to this case which caused the early demise of his otherwise healthy mother. He said that he was wrongfully imprisoned during the period he was in remand because he could not furnish bail. Suffice it for me to say that these allegations or assertions were either baseless or unsubstantiated.

116    It would also be noted that the accused enclosed a stack of documents to his written closing submissions which he did not produce during the trial. I had explained to the accused that if he had documentary evidence which he would like to present to the court, he would have to tender them during the trial[^50]. I had also explained to him that his closing submissions would have to be based on the evidence that had been adduced in court[^51].

117    In any case, four of the documents which the accused enclosed were already admitted in evidence as follows:

> (a)     Notice of Intention for Compulsory Acquisition dated 13 March 2018 (exhibit P8);

> (b)     Letter dated 18 Dec 2015 from HDB (exhibit P15);

> (c)     Letter dated 17 March 2016 from HDB (exhibit P16); and

> (d)     Police report dated 31 May 2019 lodged by the accused (exhibit P17).

118    I agreed with the submissions of the Prosecution that the remaining documents were not helpful to the case for the Defence or were irrelevant (see Prosecution’s Reply to Defence’s Closing Submissions).

## Events after the commission of the offences in the HDB charge and Penal Code charge

119    After the accused was evicted and arrested on 24 October 2018, PW6 Christopher Lim and PW7 Celia Lee testified that the HDB eviction team entered the flat and did an inventory of the items. The team also took photographs of and video recorded the items in the flat.

120    PW6 Christopher Lim told the court that in November 2018, the accused’s son contacted HDB to arrange for the accused to return to the flat to collect his belongings. There were about 11 such trips.

121    PW6 Christopher Lim also testified that HDB paid the accused compensation of slightly more than $418,000 after the compulsory acquisition of the flat. After offsetting payments like mortgage arrears and refund of about $51,000 to the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”), the accused received a balance of about $185,000 in cash. HDB also provided the accused with an interim rental flat in Punggol. Subsequently, HDB obtained approval for the accused to buy a two-room flat and the accused was able to make full payment for his new flat with the cash proceeds from the compensation sum and his CPF funds.

## Antecedents

122    The accused was a first offender.

## Prescribed punishments for the HDB charge and Penal Code charge

123    The punishment prescribed for the HDB charge was a maximum fine of $5000 or a maximum imprisonment term of six months.

124    The punishment prescribed for the Penal Code charge was a maximum imprisonment term of seven years or fine or caning or a combination of such punishments.

## Mitigation plea

125    The accused asked for a “fine or lighter sentences”. He said that he recently had a heart bypass.

## The Prosecution’s sentencing submissions for the HDB charge

126    The Prosecution informed the court that this was the first prosecution under s 79 of the Housing and Development Act. It submitted for a high fine of at least $4000[^52]. The Prosecution took reference from the sentences imposed for similar provisions which criminalised the obstruction of public servants under s 186 of the PC and s 26(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (“PCA”).

127    In support of its sentencing position, the Prosecution cited five sentencing precedents under s 186 of the PC where fines were the norm ranging from $500 to $2000. It would be noted that the maximum punishment for a s 186 PC offence was half that of the maximum punishment prescribed for s 79 of the Housing and Development Act. The Prosecution provided one precedent under s 26(b) of the PCA ie _Frederick Foo_ where the High Court maintained the imprisonment term imposed but reduced it from six weeks to three weeks’ jail. The Prosecution submitted that _Frederick Foo_ could be distinguished from the present case in that _Frederick Foo_ was a senior police officer. It would be noted that the maximum punishment provided for s 26(b) of the PCA was twice that of the maximum punishment for an offence under s 79 of the Housing and Development Act.

## The court’s decision on the sentence for the HDB charge

128    In my view, deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle for the HDB charge.

129    This case being the first prosecution under s 79 of the Housing and Development Act, I agreed with the Prosecution that the precedents under s 186 of the PC and s 26(2) of the PCA which similarly dealt with obstruction of the public servants in the discharge of their duties or functions were useful guides while bearing in mind the different penalties prescribed. The provisions are tabulated below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.66%"> <col width="66.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 79 Housing and Development Act</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Any person who obstructs any officer of the Board, or any person duly authorised by the Board in that behalf, in the performance of any thing which the Board is by this Act required or empowered to do shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 186 of the PC</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his public functions, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $2,500, or with both (prior to 1 Jan 2020)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 26(b) of the PCA</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who&nbsp;—</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) assaults, <b>obstructs</b>, hinders or delays him in effecting any entrance which he is entitled to effect under this Act, or in the execution of any duty imposed or power conferred by this Act;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

130    I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case was not one where the offence was committed on the spur of the moment. HDB had been trying to engage and discuss with the accused about the flat over a decade. The accused knew that the flat had been compulsorily acquired but he brushed off HDB’s efforts to reach him and simply ignored HDB’s letters. Up to the final day on 24 October 2018 when the HDB eviction team arrived to evict him physically, he remained obstinate and refused to give up possession of the flat. He showed no remorse during the trial and blamed HDB for dragging on the matter and misleading him when HDB was trying to help him.

131    I did not think that a jail term was warranted on the facts of this case. I was of the view that a high fine would be adequate and accordingly I imposed a fine of $4000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment for the HDB charge.

## The Prosecution’s sentencing submissions for the Penal Code charge

132    The Prosecution submitted for three months’ imprisonment for the Penal Code charge. It arrived at the proposed sentence after applying the sentencing framework set out in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> for s 332 PC offences. It also tendered six sentencing precedents whereby three months’ imprisonment were imposed for a similar offence in support of its sentencing position.

## The court’s decision on the sentence for the Penal Code charge

### Sentencing framework under Jeffrey Yeo

133    In _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1080</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”), the three-judge High Court panel held at \[42\] that a custodial sentence was the norm for offences under s 332 of the Penal Code. It observed at \[50\] that:

> Police officers must therefore be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties. In that light and coupled with the fact that police officers were often the target in the cases prosecuted under s 332 of the Penal Code, it is appropriate to have a sentencing framework which reflects society’s opprobrium of such offences.

134    The High Court laid down the following sentencing framework for cases of causing hurt to police officers and public servants who performed duties akin to police duties at \[59\]:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="15.62%"> <col width="49.92%"> <col width="34.46%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Category</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Circumstances</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing band</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or up to one year’s imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to three years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to seven years’ imprisonment.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

135    The High Court made it clear that the sentencing band in Category 1 encompassed the existing sentencing norm that was observed in the unreported decision of _Zhu Guo Feng_ where a custodial sentence of two to nine months’ imprisonment would generally be imposed for cases involving causing hurt to police officers. The High Court held that this would remain the indicative starting point for most of the offences prosecuted under s 332 of the Penal Code and that fines should be meted out only in very exceptional cases.

136    The High Court provided a list of non-exhaustive factors to assist in the assessment of harm and culpability at \[60\] which are set out below:

> (a)     The degree of hurt caused and its consequences;

> (b)     The use or attempted use of a weapon or other dangerous implement or means (e.g. biting) and its capacity to do harm;

> (c)     The age, lack of maturity or presence of mental disorder where it affects materially the responsibility of the offender;

> (d)     The circumstances leading to the commission of the offence (e.g. the offender’s motivations for causing hurt to the victim, whether the offence was planned or premeditated, whether it demonstrated contempt for police officers and their authority);

> (e)     The timing and location of the offence, in particular whether it was committed within the public’s view and hearing;

> (f)     Whether the offence involved a sustained or repeated attack;

> (g)     The number of offenders involved;

> (h)     Whether the offender intended to inflict more serious hurt than what materialised;

> (i)     Whether any steps were taken to avoid detection or prosecution; and

> (j)     The offender’s criminal history and propensity.

137    As the sentencing bands were premised on offenders pleading guilty and not having relevant criminal antecedents, the High Court also stated at \[61\] that appropriate adjustments might be necessary where the offender claimed trial and made unwarranted allegations against the victim.

138    The High Court gave several indicative illustrations of cases which fell within each of the sentencing bands described at \[62\]. In particular, it held at \[63\] that Category 1 would encompass cases where minor injuries were caused, and the bodily pain was momentary and where the culpability was low. It observed that the majority of cases that had been prosecuted thus far fell into this category.

### The court’s application of the sentencing framework in Jeffrey Yeo

139    After examining the twin considerations of harm and culpability, I was of the view that the present case fell under the lower end of Category 1. My reasons were as follows:

> (a)     The harm sustained by PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) was not serious. In relation to the Penal Code charge, he was diagnosed to have superficial injuries of his left forearm and given one day’s medical leave.

> (b)     Although the accused had shoved a bicycle frame towards PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim), it was not a hard push and the bicycle frame merely came into contact with PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim)’s left arm and elbow causing it to go numb.

> (c)     Both the Prosecution and the accused agreed that the accused did not have any mental disorder which affected his responsibility materially. In this regard, the Prosecution highlighted to the court that the accused was previously diagnosed to be suffering from a Delusional Disorder but it took the position that there was no link between the accused’s mental condition and the commission of the offences[^53]. Similarly, the accused also maintained that there was no issue with his mental health[^54].

> (d)     The offence was not planned or premeditated.

> (e)     The accused committed the offence at about 10.39am in the presence of a crowd, consisting of four other police officers and the HDB eviction team which had at least 16 members. There were no fewer than four eyewitnesses (ie PW1 Staff Sergeant Tay Huei Jing, PW3 Inspector Paul Singh, PW5 SC Sergeant Ng Tze Liang and PW6 Christopher Lim) who saw the accused punching PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) on his left arm. Although PW7 Celia Lee did not witness the assault, she was aware that one police officer was hurt. In these circumstances, there was possible prospect of erosion of public respect for the authority of the police.

> (f)     The attack did not last long but the accused punched PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) forcefully four to five times.

> (g)     The accused was a first offender.

140    In calibrating the appropriate sentence, I took into account the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The accused had claimed trial and made various unwarranted allegations against PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) and the police officers. He claimed that the police officers had used “commando techniques” on him thus causing him to punch PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) in response which was not true. He also ridiculed PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) for seeking medical attention by calling it “a joke …. for such injury to go to emergency”[^55].

> (b)     The accused even went onto his Facebook to make disparaging comments about PW4 SC Sergeant Chan Jun Jie (the victim) being a “girly policeman” and referring to the police officers and HDB officers as “dogs”. The Prosecution informed the court that the accused made the Facebook post on 6 February 2020, on the third day of the trial[^56]. The Facebook post read as follows:

>> Back from Court ..Charges.. assaulting girly policeman (who went to A&E for treatment to arms) and not opening door for “dogs”… Next hearing 23 March.. Thanks for your prayers! ..”

> (c)     The accused had shown no remorse for his actions and since he did not plead guilty, he was also not entitled to a sentencing discount.

### S 332 PC precedents

141    I had also considered the six precedents (including _Jeffrey Yeo_) tendered by the Prosecution relating to assault on police officers. For easy reference, I have set out in the table below, brief details on the nature of the assault against the police officer and the injury suffered. The offender in serial numbers one to five pleaded guilty while the last case claimed trial. Serial numbers three to five were pre-_Jeffrey Yeo_.

### Sentence imposed by the court

142    For the reasons stated above, I was of the view that a sentence of **at least** three months’ imprisonment would be warranted on the facts of this case.

143    The accused was in remand from 25 October 2018 to 9 November 2018 (16 days) because he was not able to post bail. Taking into account his remand period, I was of the view that an imprisonment term of three months would be a reasonable sentence. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment on the accused for the Penal Code charge.

## Conclusion

144    In conclusion, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $4000 in default two week’s imprisonment for the HDB charge and three months’ imprisonment for the Penal Code charge. I was of the view that the sentences imposed were fair and appropriate in the circumstances of this case.

145    The accused is on bail bailing appeal and there is a stay on the payment of the fine.
