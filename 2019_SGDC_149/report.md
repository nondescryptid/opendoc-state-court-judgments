The 6 charges consist of 1 count of consumption of controlled drugs, 2 counts of having possession of controlled drugs, 1 count of having drug taking utensils and 2 counts for failure to report for urine tests.

However, the accused had failed to report for his urine test on 28 occasions.

8       Pursuant to a Notice issued under the aforesaid Regulations on 12 March 2018 (superseding the previous notice dated 13 July 2017), the accused is required to present himself for urine test at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters on every Monday and Friday of each month from 9.30 am to 10.00 pm commencing on 13 March 2018. He contravened the said Regulation when he failed to present himself for his urine test on 25 May 2018 (Friday) without any valid reasons.

26     In addition, the accused had 6 DRC admissions from 1984 to 2001 and was subjected to 9 Drug Supervision Orders since 1979 with the latest being in September 2016. There were also convictions under the Penal Code and the Customs Act.

## The Sentence

27     The accused has been convicted of 5 charges under the MDA. These charges comprise 2 counts of consumption of a Class A controlled drug, namely 2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid or its hexanoic acid isomer or any of their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment and a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment or $20,000 fine or both, as the accused is a repeat offender. There is 1 count of possession of the same drug where the prescribed punishment is mandatory imprisonment of 2 years and up to 10 years or a fine up to $20,000 or both, as the accused has previous convictions for drug possession. There is also 1 count of failing to report for urine test where the punishment would be a fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment up to 4 years or both and 1 count of having drug taking utensils where the punishment is up to 3 years’ imprisonment or a fine up to $10,000 or both.

28     The prosecution, in their written address on sentence, citing a number of aggravating factors sought a global sentence of at least 8 years’ imprisonment. This would involve making 3 terms of imprisonment run consecutively and comprising the terms of imprisonment of 3 years for each of the drug consumption charges and the term of 2 years’ imprisonment for the drug possession charge. They stressed the fact that the majority of the offences were committed while the accused was on court bail. The accused in his oral mitigation pleaded for the lightest possible sentence.

29     In determining the appropriate sentence, I am mindful of the fact that the destructive effects of drug activities in whatever form have been universally acknowledged. The prevailing interest is the protection of society from the menace posed and the social evils associated with drug abuse. The law takes a stern view of drug activities and this is reflected in the prescribed sentences under the MDA. The objectives of the Act are to eliminate the possession, consumption, importation and trafficking of illegal drugs. With these considerations in mind, I turned to the facts of this case.

30     It would appear from the records that the accused was first charged in court on the 17 October 2018 for 3 counts of failure to report for urine tests and he was released on court bail on the same date. From the schedule of the 11 offences he is currently facing, the accused first re-offended on the 21 November 2018 when he consumed a controlled drug, which was barely a month after he was put on court bail. His bail was not revoked and he was released again. This was then followed with arrests on 15 March 2019, 16 March 2019 and 22 March 2019. He committed 2 offences on 15 March, namely consumption and possession, 2 offences on 16 March, namely possession and possession of drug taking utensils and 3 offences on 22 March 2019, namely consumption, possession and possession of drug taking utensils. The accused was not deterred at all by his 3 re-arrests prior to 22 March 2019.

31     Committing offences while on court bail is definitely an aggravating factor which the court must take into account. (See PP _v Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 753</span> and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 217</span>). As stated in the cases mentioned, it demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention. In this case, the accused committed 8 offences while on court bail. Further, the accused’s track record speaks for itself. He has been in the system and committing drug offences since 1978, about 4 decades, sent to DRC on 6 occasions and subjected to drug supervision orders for a total of 9 times.

32     In respect of the drug consumption and possession charges, since I had imposed the mandatory minimum sentences of 3 years’ imprisonment for each consumption charge and 2 years’ imprisonment for the possession charge, I can only presume that the accused is not dissatisfied with these individual sentences. There was no uplift from the mandatory minimum in spite of the fact that in respect firstly, for the drug consumption offences there were 3 previous convictions for consumption culminating in a sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment in 2012 for consumption of a specified drug and there is one other consumption charge which is TIC. As for the drug possession, this was his third conviction and his last sentence in 1996 was similarly the mandatory minimum of 2 years’ imprisonment and there are two other possession charges which were TIC.

33     In respect of his failure to report for urine test, based on his record, it was undisputed that this was not the first time he had committed such an offence, as he had 1 previous similar conviction in 1980 and he was sentenced to a 1 month imprisonment term. The accused did not offer any reason why he had not complied with the order to submit himself for urine tests which he had failed to do so since December 2017. While he had pleaded guilty to 1 count, there were 2 other similar charges which had been TIC for the purpose of sentencing with his consent. It is trite law that the approach the courts should adopt if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offence proceeded with would be increased. In addition, in actuality the accused had failed to report for his urine tests on 28 occasions (paragraph 4 of the SOF). For this charge, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence would be 6 months’ imprisonment. A similar sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was also passed for the drug taking utensils charge as there was 1 other TIC charge. While the prosecution had submitted for 9 months’ imprisonment, considering that the range for this offence is between 2 to 4 months’ imprisonment, an uplift of 2 months would be in order.

34     The next issue to be considered would be the terms of imprisonment which should be ordered to run consecutively. While I am mindful that at the very minimum, only 2 terms of imprisonment needed to be ordered to run consecutively as long as it includes the longest term, considering the number of offences which the accused had committed, the aggravating factor of him committing numerous offences while on court bail, I agree with the prosecution that making 3 terms of imprisonment run consecutively would be appropriate. This would be the sentences for the 2 consumption charges and the possession charge. These charges involve the invasion of separate and distinct legally protected interests. They were committed on 3 different dates. Taking into account the accused’s overall criminality, his age, future prospects and his past records, 3 terms of imprisonment running consecutively would not offend the totality principle and the one transaction rule. The resulting sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment cannot be described as crushing given that his last previous sentence was 6 years’ imprisonment which obviously did not have any deterrent effect on him.

35     All considered, taking into account all the relevant factors, I passed the following sentences on the accused:
