\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9173/2021/01.\]

17 December 2021

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused was Goh Ngak Eng (also known as Chris), a 54-year-old male Singaporean. He was a director of Megamarine Services Pte Ltd (“Megamarine”). He faced 59 charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241 (“the Act”)[^1]. These were purely private sector corruption charges. On 28 January 2021, the accused pleaded guilty to 19 proceeded charges and consented for the remaining 40 charges to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. The matter was adjourned for his counsel to prepare the mitigation plea. Arising from the court’s queries, on 7 May 2021, parties agreed that the accused’s earlier guilty plea should be set aside, and a fresh plea taken because the statement of facts which the accused had admitted to did not support the particulars in the proceeded charges. As such I rejected the accused’s previous plea of guilt and set aside his earlier conviction.

2       On the same day on 7 May 2021, the accused re-entered his guilty plea to the 19 proceeded charges and he admitted to an amended statement of facts dated 7 May 2021 which corresponded to and supported the elements of the proceeded charges. The accused gave his fresh consent to have the remaining 40 charges TIC for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC charges”). Thus, on 7 May 2021, I found the accused guilty as charged and convicted him on the 19 proceeded charges.

3       On 11 August 2021, after having heard parties’ submissions on sentence over several dates, I imposed an aggregate jail term of 17 months and three weeks’ imprisonment on the accused. The accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed against it. He is presently on bail pending appeal.

4       I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The 19 proceeded charges

5       The 19 charges that the Prosecution proceeded with against the accused comprised 15 conspiracy charges of corruptly obtaining gratification under s 6(a) read with s 29(a) of the Act and four charges of corruptly giving gratification under s 6(b) of the Act.

6       The conspiracy charges were similarly framed. For easy reference, where the charges related to the same corrupt vendor/giver and the details only differed as to the date that the accused received the gratification and the gratification amount, I would only reproduce one charge and set out the differing details for the other charges in a table. The 15 proceeded conspiracy charges to corruptly obtain gratification were as follows (emphasis mine).

> One proceeded charge relating to U Keh Choon (“Keh Choon”) /Titan Offshore Equipment Pte Ltd (“Titan”)

> DAC-920809-2020 (amended 1st charge/exhibit C1A)

## The 40 TIC charges

8       I have tabulated at Annex A, brief details relating to the remaining 40 TIC charges.

## The statement of facts

9       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts (“SOF”) dated 7 May 2021 without any qualification.

> 1.    The accused is Goh Ngak Eng (“**the Accused**”), a 54-year old male Singaporean. He is a Director of Megamarine Services Pte Ltd (“Megamarine”), a company in the business of manufacturing and repairing of air winches and general trading of equipment which was set up in November 2006.

> 2.    The other co-accused persons in this case are:

>> a.    Alvin Lim Wee Lun (“**Alvin**”), a 40-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was employed as a Yard Manager in the Facilities Department at Keppel FELS (“**KFELS**”) shipyard. Alvin was in charge of maintaining the operational readiness of the facilities in the shipyard. When there were any maintenance or servicing jobs, Alvin was in charge of overseeing the job if his team was capable to do it or engaging external contractors if his team was not able to do it. Alvin was able to decide on the contractors that were to be invited to quote for jobs at KFELS, and was able to recommend contractors for jobs to be awarded to.

>> b.    Rajavikraman S/O Jayapandian (“**Raj**”), a 45-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, Raj was the Project Director at Rotating Offshore Solutions Pte Ltd (“**Rotating**”), a company in the business of building and designing generators and compressors.

>> c.    U Keh Choon (“**Keh Choon**”), a 50-year-old male Singaporean. He is the Director of Titan Offshore Equipment Pte Ltd (“**Titan**”). Titan is currently wholly owned by Keh Choon and is in the business of manufacturing and servicing marine equipment, including capstans

>> d.    Goh Sheng Li, Stanley (“**Stanley**”), a 33-year-old male Singaporean. He is the director of Spectrama Marine & Industrial Supplies Pte Ltd (“**Spectrama**”), which is in the business of supplying, repairing, servicing and testing of industrial lifting equipment.

>> e.    Fatkullah Bin Tiap (“**Ahmad**”), a 59-year-old male Singaporean. He set up Growa (F.E.) Pte Ltd (“**Growa**”) in 1993 and is the company’s Managing Director. Growa is in the business of distribution of hoists and cranes and providing services, such as repair, servicing and inspections of hoists and cranes.

>> f.    Ong Tun Chai (“**Ong**”), a 48-year-old male Singaporean. He is currently the Manager of 3W Logistics Services (“**3W**”), a sole proprietorship registered under his mother’s name. 3W is in the business of transporting cleaning chemicals and laundry for hospitals, prisons and hotels.

> 3.    According to KFELS’ procurement process, it was the Purchasing Department’s responsibility to source for quotations from contractors. However, during the period when Alvin oversaw the Facilities Department, he had instructed his staff to source for quotations before raising the Electronic Purchase Requisition (EPR). The details of the contractor and the price quoted would be included in the description of the EPR. This was a common practice in the KFELS shipyard at the time, for the end-users, like the Facilities Department, to source for quotations instead of the supposed Purchasing Department. Although the Purchasing Manager had known that this should not be allowed, the Commercial Bid Analysis (CBA) and Purchase Orders (POs) processed by the Buyers were still approved.

> 4.    Due to this administrative lapse in the procurement process, Alvin effectively decided which contractors were to be invited to quote for jobs at KFELS and subsequently, which of these contractors to recommend for jobs to be awarded to. After the awarding of the jobs to the said contractors, Alvin also made use of his position to allow the job to be carried out smoothly, by expediting POs to be issued and payments to be made to the contractors.

> **The conspiracy between the Accused, Raj and Alvin**

> 5.    The Accused was acquainted with Raj through business dealings. Sometime in late 2014, Raj approached the accused and said that he would be able to refer jobs from KFELS to vendors, as he knew someone in KFELS called Alvin who had the power to recommend for jobs to be awarded. According to Raj, Alvin wanted 15% of the invoice value of the jobs (before GST), in order to award the jobs, so the invoices would have to be marked up.

> 6.    Raj and the accused decided that they would seek vendors for jobs in KFELS, and would ask for the invoices to be marked up by more than 15%. After giving Alvin his share, the remaining amount would be split between the accused and Raj evenly. As the Accused needed the money, he agreed to the plan.

> **Facts relating to the charge involving Titan**

> 7.    Sometime in late 2014, Raj and the Accused had a discussion in the Accused’ office regarding finding a company to supply hydraulic winches/capstans and repair services for KFELS. They had a discussion about recommending the job to Titan, a company that the Accused knew was suitable for the job.

> 8.    The Accused then contacted Keh Choon and asked if he was interested to supply 2 capstans to KFELS. Keh Choon indicated his interest and responded with an indicative price of the capstans. The Accused, on Raj’s advice, responded with a revised marked up price to submit in the quotation to KFELS. Keh Choon agreed that if Titan were to be awarded the job, the difference in the two amounts would be paid to the accused and Raj Chris as commission for referring the job to Titan. Keh Choon was informed that 15% of the sum would be given to someone in KFELS so as to get the business.

> 9.    Keh Choon agreed to the arrangement and from 2015 to 2017, KFELS purchased 2 new capstans from Titan and engaged Titan for its servicing and repair services for 6 existing capstans at the KFELS shipyard. For every job that Titan invoiced KFELS, the Accused would receive a copy of Titan’s invoice to KFELS. The Accused would calculate the amount of mark-up and use Megamarine to invoice Titan for the marked-up portions accordingly. The Accused also requested his friend Ong to use 3W to invoice Titan on four occasions in exchange of 8% of 3W’s invoice amount, which Ong agreed to.

> 10.    In all, Keh Choon made a total of 7 commission payments to Megamarine from 2015 to 2017 from Titan’s accounts, amounting to a sum of $196,661.72. These payments included the following:

> **Facts relating to the charges involving Spectrama**

> 11.    Sometime in late 2014, Raj asked the Accused if he had a contact of a contractor that could provide servicing and repairs of chain blocks and lever blocks for KFELS.

> 12.    The Accused then arranged an introductory meeting in his office for Raj to meet Stanley of Spectrama. The Accused was previously a long-term customer of Spectrama. During the meeting, the Accused and Raj explained to Stanley about the potential job for KFELS. Stanley expressed his interest to take on the job and they went on to discuss the prices of the servicing and repairs of the chain blocks and lever blocks.

> 13.    During another meeting with Stanley in the Accused’s office, the Accused and Raj requested for a percentage of the invoiced amounts of the jobs as commission for referring the jobs to Spectrama. It was also made known to Stanley that someone in KFELS would receive a share of the commissions so as to get the business. Stanley agreed. He factored in the commission and marked up the prices in his quotations to KFELS. The quotations were sent to Alvin and eventually Spectrama was issued with 3 blanket purchase orders for the works.

> 14.    From 2015 to 2017, Spectrama performed a total of 49 jobs for the servicing and repair of chain blocks and lever blocks for KFELS. For each work that Spectrama had invoiced KFELS, Stanley would send the invoice to the Accused, who would calculate the amount of mark-up and invoice Spectrama for the marked-up portion accordingly. These invoices were prepared on the Megamarine letterhead.

> 15.    In all, Stanley made a total of 21 payments to Megamarine from 2015 to 2017 from Spectrama’s accounts, amounting to a sum of $190,917.01. These payments included the following:

> **Facts relating to the charges involving Growa**

> 16.    Sometime in late 2014, Raj also asked if the Accused had a contact of a contractor that could provide crane inspection services for KFELS.

> 17.    The Accused contacted Ahmad and told him about a job opportunity for Growa to provide crane inspection services for KFELS. Ahmad indicated his interest and sent his sales manager, Desmond to find out more details from the Accused. The Accused introduced Raj to Desmond. Thereafter, Raj arranged for Ahmad and Desmond to meet Alvin and his superintendents to discuss what KFELS required and what Growa could offer. Desmond then prepared the quotation for crane inspection services based on the specifications provided for the job. The quotation was a list of prices for the crane inspection based on the span and the capacity of the crane.

> 18.    Raj and the Accused reviewed the quotation that Desmond prepared. They then set up another meeting with Ahmad where Raj informed Ahmad that he had to mark up the prices in the quotation in order for Growa to pay commissions to the accused and Raj in return for referring Growa for the job at KFELS. Ahmad was also informed that a portion of these commissions would be paid to someone in KFELS so as to get the business. Ahmad agreed and instructed Desmond to mark up the quotation by 40% to 50%. Desmond then submitted the revised quotation to one of the superintendents of KFELS.

> 19.    Between the period of 10 January 2015 to 25 October 2016, Growa performed a total of 22 crane inspection jobs for KFELS. For every job that Growa invoiced KFELS, the Accused would receive a copy of Growa’s invoice to KFELS. The Accused would calculate the amount of mark-up and use Megamarine to invoice Growa for the marked-up portions accordingly. The Accused also requested his friend Ong to use 3W to invoice Growa on six occasions in exchange of 8% of 3W’s invoice amount. Ong agreed to the Accused request.

> 20.    In all, Ahmad made a total of 18 commission payments to Megamarine from 2015 to 2016 from Growa’s accounts, amounting to a sum of $492,274.90. These payments included the following:

> **Monies paid to Raj and Alvin**

> 21.    After receiving each commission payment from Titan, Spectrama and Growa (“the three companies”), the Accused would compute Alvin’s, Raj’s and his own share of the commissions. After deducting Alvin’s share, which was 15% of the invoiced amounts (before GST) of KFELS’s payment to the three companies, the Accused would deduct 17% of the invoiced amount (before GST) of the three companies’ payment to Megamarine, for his corporate tax payment, before splitting the remaining amount with Raj evenly. The Accused passed Raj’s and Alvin’s share of the commission to Raj in either two separate envelopes or separated in the same envelope. On the same day that Raj received the monies from the Accused, Raj met Alvin and passed his share of the commissions to him.

> 22.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed 15 counts of abetting by engaging in a conspiracy with Raj and Alvin to corruptly obtain gratification from Keh Choon, Stanley and Ahmad as inducement for doing acts in relation to Alvin Lim’s principal’s affairs, to wit, furthering the business interest of Titan, Spectrama and Growa with KFELS, and in pursuance of such conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, acts took place, to wit, gratification sums were obtained from Keh Choon, Stanley and Ahmad by the Accused, for Alvin, Raj and himself, which acts were committed in consequence of the abetment, and which charges are for offences punishable under section 6(a) read with section 29(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

> 23.    The accused maintained records of how much money he received from Keh Choon, Stanley and Ahmad, and how much was paid to Raj and Alvin. Pursuant to their conspiracy, the total amount paid by Keh Choon, Stanley and Ahmad as corrupt gratification is **$879,853.63**. Alvin received the sum of $293,822.39, Raj received the sum of $191,115.89 and the accused received the sum of $191,115.89. The remaining sum was paid by Megamarine to IRAS as corporate tax.

> **Facts relating to DAC-920855-2020**

> 24.    Sometime in March 2014, Raj informed the accused that Kuah Bee Leng, Rotating’s Purchasing Manager, would request for a quotation for the supply of hardware and if Megamarine clinched the deal, the accused would have to give Raj some commission for referring and recommending the works to Megamarine. The accused agreed as he wanted the business from Rotating.

> 25.    Megamarine was eventually awarded the job. Pursuant to their agreement, sometime in March 2014, the accused passed the sum of $3,000 to Raj.

> 26.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed 1 count of corruptly giving to Raj gratification as a reward for doing acts in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, furthering the business interest of Megamarine with Rotating, which charges are for offences punishable under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

> **Facts relating to the charges involving 3W (DACs 920859, 920860 and 920861 of 2020)**

> 27.    Sometime in late 2016, the Accused asked his friend, Ong, to help prepare 3W invoices and delivery orders for Titan and Growa. In return, he promised to give Ong 8% of the invoiced amount.

> 28.    Ong agreed and prepared four 3W invoices and the corresponding delivery orders to Titan, and six 3W invoices and the corresponding delivery orders to Growa. The descriptions stated on these invoices were all fictitious as none of the jobs stated in the invoices and delivery orders were carried out.

> 29.    For these invoices and delivery orders, the Accused gave a total sum of $15,092.80 over 10 occasions to Ong in 2016. These payments included the following:

> 30.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed 3 counts of corruptly giving to Ong gratification as rewards for doing acts in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, preparing fictitious invoices on his company letterhead, which charges are for offences punishable under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

## Three distinct sets of corrupt dealings

10     As reflected in the SOF, the accused was involved in three distinct sets of corrupt dealings. The first set of corrupt dealings arose from his conspiracy with Raj and Alvin to obtain gratification from three vendors namely Keh Choon, Stanley and Ahmad (“the conspiracy charges”). There were 46 conspiracy charges. The Prosecution proceeded with 15 conspiracy charges and the remaining 31 conspiracy charges were taken into consideration.

11     The second and third sets of corrupt dealings concerned the accused as the corrupt giver under s 6(b) of the Act. The second set of corrupt dealings involving 3 charges occurred prior to the accused participating in the conspiracy. The accused had bribed Raj on three occasions in March 2014 (“the charges relating to Raj”). The charges relating to Raj were not connected to the conspiracy charges. The Prosecution proceeded with one charge relating to Raj and the remaining two charges were taken into consideration.

12     The third set of corrupt dealings involving 10 charges occurred about one year and nine months into the conspiracy. On ten occasions between September 2016 and 4 December 2016, the accused corruptly gave bribes to Ong in return for Ong issuing fictitious invoices on 3W’s letterhead to Titan and Growa (“the charges relating to Ong”). Although Ong was not part of the conspiracy, the charges relating to Ong were linked to the conspiracy charges. The Prosecution proceeded with three charges relating to Ong and the remaining seven charges were taken into consideration.

13     The six co-accused involved in the corrupt dealings namely Raj, Alvin, Keh Choon, Stanley, Ahmad and Ong had all been charged in connection with these schemes.

## Breakdown of the gratification amounts in the 59 charges

14     The breakdown of the gratification amounts involved in the 59 charges comprising 19 proceeded charges and 40 TIC charges was as follows:

## Antecedents

15     The accused had no antecedents.

## Prescribed punishment under the Act

16     The punishment for committing or abetting an offence under s 6 of the Act for corruptly receiving or giving gratification was a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.

## Sentencing framework in _Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters_

17     The Prosecution and the Defence submitted that the sentencing framework laid down by Justice Chan Seng Onn in _Takaaki Masui v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 160</span> (“_Masui_”) for purely private sector corruption cases under ss 6(a) and 6(b) of the Act was binding on this court and applicable in this case. I agreed. In this regard, purely private sector corruption cases were defined as corruption in the private sector which did not engage the public service rationale or enhanced punishment provision in s 7 of the Act (at \[79(c)\] of _Masui_).

18     In _Masui_, Chan J laid down a two-stage, five-step sentencing framework (at \[236\] to \[286\]). The _Masui_ framework was for determining the indicative starting sentence per charge for an offender who claimed trial (at \[256\]). Briefly, the five steps were as below.

> (a)      Step 1 required the court to identify and assess the relevant offence-specific factors that went towards the harm caused and the culpability of the offender (see \[238\] to \[253\]).

> (b)      Steps 2 and 3 required the court to derive an indicative starting sentence by using a Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix which could be further simplified in the form of a Contour Matrix (see \[254\] to \[283\]).

> (c)      Steps 4 and 5 required the court to consider offender-specific factors which did not directly relate to the commission of the offences, and the totality principle (see \[284\] to \[286\]).

## The _Romel_ categories

19     In _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“_Romel_”), Menon CJ had identified three categories of cases whereby private sector corruption could manifest. This analytical framework formulated by Menon CJ to broadly assess the type and seriousness of corruption involved in a case of private sector corruption was commonly referred to as the “_Romel_ categories”. The _Romel_ categories as classified by Menon CJ are set out below (at \[26\] of _Romel_):

> (a)    First, where the receiving party is paid to confer on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest.

> (b)    Second, where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This also is typically done at the payer’s behest.

> (c)    Third, where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the receiving party’s behest.

20     Chan J in formulating the _Masui_ sentencing framework, had utilised the _Romel_ categories.

21     In the present case, the parties agreed that the offences committed by the accused fell under _Romel_ category 1.

## Issues before the court

22     Menon CJ held in _Romel_ that there was no presumption in favour of a non-custodial sentence where private sector corruption was concerned and whether the custodial threshold was crossed for category 1 cases would depend on the facts (at \[26 and 27\]). In _Masui_, Chan J’s Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix framework similarly recognised that while _Romel_ category 1 cases would generally attract a fine, there would be cases falling within _Romel_ category 1 which crossed the custodial threshold due to the severity of the offences.

23     It was not in dispute that the custodial threshold had been crossed in the present case.

24     The disputed issues before the court were as follows:

> (a)     What should be the applicable offence-specific and offender-specific factors at Steps 1 and 4 respectively of the _Masui_ framework?

> (b)     What should be the appropriate indicative starting sentence per charge at Step 3 of the _Masui_ framework?

> (c)     Whether additional fines should be imposed at Step 3 of the _Mausi_ framework.

> (d)     What should be the final sentences for the charges according to the gratification amounts after adjusting for the offender-specific factors and accounting for the totality principle at Steps 4 and 5 of the _Masui_ framework?

> (e)     Whether the sentence for the charge in DAC-920855-2020 should only attract a fine? This charge was amongst the earliest offences committed by the accused which related to the giving of a bribe of $3000 to Raj.

## The Prosecution’s sentencing position

### Using the Masui framework

25     Upon applying the _Masui_ framework in this case, the Prosecution assessed the harm as slight and culpability as medium, both at the upper end[^2]. It submitted that at Step 3, the indicative starting sentences should range between seven to ten months’ imprisonment and fine of up to $100,000 per charge. After accounting for the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, it submitted that the final sentences at Step 4 should range between 5.5 months’ imprisonment to 9.5 months’ imprisonment[^3].

26     The Prosecution further submitted that six sentences should run consecutively thereby yielding a proposed global sentence of between 30 to 34 months’ imprisonment in this case[^4].

### Using the precedents-based approach as an alternative

27     The Prosecution submitted in the alternative, a precedents-based sentencing approach for the court’s consideration. Going by the precedents-based approach, the Prosecution submitted that the global sentence should be between 20 to 24 months’ imprisonment[^5]. The Prosecution took the position that there would be different sentencing outcomes depending on which approach one used[^6]. In this case, the Prosecution was of the view that using the _Masui_ approach would lead to a higher global imprisonment sentence as compared to the global imprisonment sentence derived from the precedents-based approach.

28     I have reproduced the Prosecution’s suggested final individual sentences for the 19 proceeded charges using both the _Masui_ framework and the precedents-based approach[^7] at Annex B. I would point out that the Prosecution had miscalculated its proposed global sentence under the precedents-based approach. It stated that using the precedents-based approach, by ordering six of the jail terms as recommended, it would lead to an aggregate sentence of 20 to 24 months’ imprisonment. A careful computation of the Prosecution’s recommendations under the precedents-based approach would show that the correct proposed aggregate sentence should be between 29.5 to 30.5 months’ imprisonment.

29     The Prosecution submitted that fines would not be appropriate in this case.

## The Defence’s sentencing position

30     Before I set out the Defence’s sentencing position, it would be pertinent for me to highlight two misconceptions on the part of the counsel for the Defence which became apparent during the court proceedings. Counsel’s misconceptions had created some confusion. First, counsel for the Defence was misconceived that the court was required to sentence the accused for **both** the proceeded charges **and** the TIC charges and had initially suggested sentences for all 59 charges[^8]. Secondly, counsel for the Defence was misconceived that fines could be concurrent[^9] and had initially proposed an aggregate fine of $130,685 for the 19 proceeded charges[^10]. Counsel later revised his proposed fine amounts downwards after he realized that fines were cumulative.

31     The updated sentencing submissions of the Defence may be summarised as follows.

32     Upon applying the _Masui_ framework in the present case, the Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s assessment that harm was slight, and culpability was medium but argued that harm was at the lower portion of slight harm and culpability was at the middle-upper part of medium culpability[^11].

33     The Defence submitted that at Step 3, the indicative starting sentences should range between two weeks’ imprisonment to 13 week’s imprisonment per charge. It originally urged the court to run “five charges consecutively”[^12] which consisted of four charges where it sought for both imprisonment terms and fines and one charge relating to Raj in DAC-920855-2020 where it sought for only a fine of $3,000. When counsel for the Defence appreciated that only imprisonment terms could be ordered to run either concurrently or consecutively, he then proposed that four imprisonment terms should run consecutively. With four consecutive imprisonment terms, the Defence submitted that the indicative global sentence in this case should be seven months and one week’s imprisonment (31 weeks’ imprisonment) [^13].

34     The Defence further argued that additional fines should also be imposed in this case. It recommended initially that the court should impose a total fine of $130,685 in respect of the 19 proceeded charges. Subsequently, when counsel understood that fines could not be concurrent, he backtracked from his earlier recommendation as he now found the total fine amount of $130,685 to be “too crushing”[^14]. His revised submission was that the total fine to be imposed for the 19 proceeded charges should be $43,000, with $3,000 to be imposed for DAC-920855-2020 and the balance of $40,000 to be imposed across the other 18 proceeded charges at the discretion of the court[^15].

35     At Step 4, after adjusting for the offender-specific factors, the Defence submitted that the final global sentence should be 19 weeks’ imprisonment and a total fine of $43,000 in default one week’s imprisonment. In view of the fines and default sentence of one week, the Defence urged the court to reduce the global imprisonment term by one more week. The final desired global sentence for the Defence was therefore 18 weeks/4 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment and total fine of $43,000 in default one week’s imprisonment[^16].

36     For easy reference, I have reproduced the Defence’s indicative starting and final individual sentences[^17] for the 19 proceeded charges at Annex C and Defence’s position on the final global sentence[^18] at Annex D.

37     As regards the Prosecution’s submissions that this court could alternatively avail itself to the precedents-based approach, the Defence argued that the Prosecution had erred in law by advancing two distinct sentencing approaches because it cast doubt as to whether _Masui_ was binding on the lower courts and it was also unfair to the accused.

## Sentencing considerations

38     It is established law that general deterrence and punishment are the main sentencing considerations in corruption cases (see _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> (“_Ang Seng Thor_”) at \[33\]).

## _Masui_ framework and the alternative precedents-based approach

39     I noted that other than maintaining the stance that applying the _Masui_ framework would lead to a higher global sentence than the precedents-based approach, which according to the Prosecution was ten months’ more in this case, the Prosecution did not explain why it took this position.

40     In _Masui_ at \[251\], Chan J acknowledged that that there was a tremendous amount of judicial discretion involved and therefore much subjectivity not only in identifying the relevant factors but also in the weight to be attached to derive the appropriate level of harm or culpability as inputs to the harm-culpability matrix in order to obtain the indicative starting sentence. At \[347\], Chan J cautioned that sentencing was a fluid and difficult evaluative exercise with very real consequences for the offenders at hand and that sentencing guidelines and frameworks were not to be applied mechanistically and indiscriminately, but flexibly and discerningly.

41     In devising the _Masui_ framework, Chan J had been careful to conduct “backtesting” to ensure that his indicative sentences were in line with recent reported High Court cases or precedents approved by the High Court where full written grounds were issued: at pages 174 to 184.

42     In any event, after I had applied the _Masui_ framework in the present case, I further tested the sentences derived from the _Masui_ framework against the relevant precedents to review the appropriateness of the sentences. Suffice it for me to say at this juncture that I was satisfied that the sentences I imposed in this case were consistent with the High Court precedents.

## Applying the _Masui_ sentencing framework

### Step 1 - Identifying and assessing the relevant offence-specific factors that went towards the harm caused and the culpability of the offender

43     At Step 1, Chan J had set out several non-exhaustive offence-specific factors applicable to purely private sector corruption cases under ss 6(a) and 6(b) of the Act: at \[239\]. The assessment would generally be a “holistic and broad-brush assessment” of the degree of harm and culpability by reference to all the relevant offence-specific factors: at \[253\].

44     In the present case, both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed on the same single factor going towards harm. As for the factors going towards culpability, the Prosecution submitted that there were five culpability factors, but the Defence argued that there were only three culpability factors. Notwithstanding, both the Prosecution and the Defence accepted that this case fell under slight harm and medium culpability although the Prosecution argued that both slight harm and medium culpability were at the upper end while the Defence contended that slight harm was at the lower end and medium culpability was at the middle-upper portion.

45     I agreed with the harm and culpability factors as identified by Prosecution. The offence-specific factors which I found relevant are set out in the table below.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence-specific factors</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Factors going towards harm</u></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Factors going towards culpability</u></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">a) Potential detriment to KFELS</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) Degree of planning and pre-meditation in the conspiracy charges</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Prolonged duration of offending over 26 months, between January 2015 and March 2017 (in respect of the conspiracy charges).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) High value of gratification received.

46     After assessing the factors, I agreed with the Prosecution that harm was at the upper end of slight harm and culpability was at the upper end of medium culpability. My reasons were as follows.

47     In respect of the factor going towards harm, I agreed with the parties that the corrupt transactions in the conspiracy charges posed potential detriment to KFELS. It was not disputed that the offences had corrupted Alvin. Alvin who had the power to select and recommend vendors for KFELS was corrupted into ensuring that the jobs were only awarded to vendors who had given or promised him money in return. The offences compromised a fair and safe procurement process at KFELS, and an unsuitable vendor could lead to disastrous consequences given the nature of its business.

48     The Defence argued that since there was only one harm factor, harm should be at the lower portion of slight harm. I disagreed. The reason why this case was assessed to be of slight harm was because there was only one harm factor. It did not automatically mean that the harm should be at the lower end of slight harm. Given that KFELS was in the strategic industry, the potential harm could be significant. Therefore, while I assessed harm to be slight, I was of the view that it ought to be on the upper end of slight harm.

49     In respect of the factors going towards culpability, the Defence only accepted the factors at (a) to (c) in the table at \[45\]. Factor (a) pertained to the planning and pre-meditation involved in the conspiracy charges. The accused and Raj hatched the plan to approach potential vendors that they could refer to Alvin and they asked the vendors to mark up their quotations to KFELS by more than 15% so that if the vendors were awarded the contract, after giving Alvin his share of 15% (before GST), the accused and Raj could also take a cut for themselves (see \[6\] of the SOF). I noted that the planning included factoring into the mark-up, the corporate tax liability of Megamarine which was 17% (before GST) of the invoiced amount when the accused eventually invoiced the vendors for the commissions using Megamarine’s letterhead (see \[21\] of the SOF).

50     Factor (b) pertained to the prolonged offending in this case. The vendors made payments to the accused/Megamarine over a period of 26 months. While the Defence acknowledged the sustained offending, it argued that the court should regard the series of transactions in relation to each vendor as “one single transaction”. It pointed out that once a vendor was appointed, it was a continuing engagement until the completion of the project during which the vendor would be called upon as and when its services were required. Not every conspiracy charge involved a tender process. It therefore submitted that although the offence period was 26 months, the court should note that the duration of engagement of each vendor was subject to the time required for the job and the needs of KFELS[^19].

51     In my view, it was disingenuous of the Defence to suggest that the protracted length of offending was due to the ongoing nature of the projects with each vendor. I noted that the 26 months’ offending period was computed based on the actual dates that the commissions were paid to the accused/Megamarine between January 2015 to 23 March 2017 (see Schedule of Offences where the charges were set out in a chronological order of the offence dates). It was not a situation where the commissions had been paid upfront but the entire project duration was adversely taken against the accused. This was a case where the 26 months’ offence period truly reflected the period of repeated offending by the accused. Besides, all the transactions in relation to each vendor took place on different occasions and they could hardly be said to form one single transaction.

52     Factor (c) pertained to the high value of the gratification received. In _Public Prosecutor v Tan Kok Ming Michael and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 926</span> (“_Michael Tan_”), the High Court recognised that 1) the value of the gratification usually reflected the degree of illegitimate advantage the giver wished to secure through the bribe and 2) the value of gratification demanded or accepted reflected the greed of the receiver for monetary gain, and hence his culpability, (see \[99(a)\]. In this case, the total gratification received pursuant to the conspiracy was enormous at $566,289.15 in the 15 proceeded charges and the accused’s share was a total of $191,115.19 from the scheme which was a substantial sum. Both the Prosecution[^20] and the Defence[^21] submitted that the entire gratification of $879,853.63 in the conspiracy charges was high and reflected on the level of the accused’s culpability. As the total sum of $879,853.63 would include the gratification in the TIC charges as well which was an offender-specific factor to be considered at Step 4, to avoid double counting, at this stage of the sentencing framework, I had only considered the gratification amount of $566,289.15 in the 15 proceeded conspiracy charges. Nonetheless, the gratification of $566,289.15 in the 15 proceeded charges was still a huge sum.

53     I noted that in _Masui_, Chan J was of the view that the value of the gratification given or received by an offender was a factor going towards both harm and culpability (at \[245\]). In this regard, Chan J had departed from the approach taken in _Public Prosecutor v Wong Chee Meng and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 807</span> (“_Wong Chee Meng_”) at \[71\], where Menon CJ held that “it would be preferable, in the interests of conceptual clarity, to regard the quantum of gratification as a factor going only towards culpability as far as the sentencing framework set out in \[_Wong Chee Mong_\] is concerned” (at \[244\] of _Masui_). Chan J had addressed the concerns of double counting by saying that the sentencing court could avoid criticism by stating exactly the relevance of the amount of the gratification to the harm caused by the offence and the culpability of the offender (at \[250\]).

54     In the present case, I had evaluated the value of gratification as a factor going towards culpability. Similarly, the Prosecution and the Defence had also assessed the value of the gratification as a factor going towards culpability.

55     The Defence disputed that factors (d) and (e) in the table at \[45\] were present in this case. With regards to factor (d) that the accused had taken efforts to cover up the corrupt transactions in the conspiracy charges, first, the Defence emphasized that the words “conceal” and “hide” did not appear in the SOF. Next, it contended that since the accused had kept records of the bribes which he received from the three vendors and the moneys he handed over to Raj and Alvin[^22] and had even paid corporate taxes with the corrupt gratification, it showed that he did not make any attempts to hide or conceal anything.

56     I disagreed with the Defence. The accused pleaded guilty to the charges relating to Ong[^23] and admitted unreservedly to the SOF[^24] that he had enlisted Ong’s help to issue fictitious invoices to Titan and Growa for jobs which were not performed. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused was making use of falsified invoices issued by Ong/3W to avoid detection[^25]. On the face of it, the fictitious invoices would cloak the corrupt transactions. While the accused might have kept meticulous records of the corrupt payments and paid Megamarine’s corporate taxes out of the gratification received, these facts were at best neutral.

57     As regards factor (e) that the accused had committed the offences out of greed, the Prosecution highlighted that the accused admitted to \[6\] of the SOF that he had agreed to participate in the conspiracy as he needed money. The Defence however denied that the accused was motivated by greed. It stated that 2015 to 2017 were slow years and since his company could do with additional money, the accused decided to commit the offences on seeing the business opportunity[^26]. The Defence asserted that the bribes which the accused had obtained for his role in the conspiracy were paid to Megamarine to further the interest of Megamarine and that he did not receive the moneys for himself. The Defence claimed that Megamarine had used the bribes to towards paying the employees’ salaries, company expenses and corporate taxes which would rebut the inference that he was motivated by greed. The Defence further argued that since the accused, despite not receiving the moneys personally, had voluntarily disgorged the gratification of $191,115.89 on behalf of his company from his own personal account, it showed that he did not commit the offences out of greed[^27].

58     I noted that of the total gratification of $879,853.63 obtained from the conspiracy charges, the accused had retained a sum of $394,915.35 from which he used $203,799.46 to pay for Megamarine’s corporate taxes. He received the balance of $191,115.89 as his share for his role in the conspiracy which was a significant amount although he asserted that the money was utilised by Megamarine towards its operational expenses. The accused was not acting out of altruistic reasons when he committed the offences. As he had admitted, he needed money and he had secured the sizable bribes by seizing the “business opportunity”. He had clearly committed the offences for financial gain and profit. Besides, the corporate taxes were a statutory liability which Megamarine had to fulfil. In both instances, by disbursing the bribes to pay for Megamarine’s corporate taxes and his share of $191,115.89 to pay for Megamarine’s expenses, the accused was furthering the interests of Megamarine which would ultimately benefit the accused as a director too. As for the accused disgorging the bribes voluntarily by surrendering the sum of $191,115.89 from his own pockets, suffice it for me to note that it was a penalty sum that he was liable to pay in any event under s 13 of the Act.

59     To recap, at Step 1, given the above factors which I found to be relevant, I assessed the harm to be on the upper end of slight harm and the culpability to be at the upper end of medium culpability.

### Steps 2 and 3 – Deriving an indicative starting sentence by using a Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix and a Contour Matrix

60     Having assessed the level of harm and culpability, at Step 2, I applied the inputs to the Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix which yielded an indicative sentencing range of up to 12 months’ imprisonment plus fine up to $100,000. At Step 3, I had to assess exactly where the accused’s offences would lie within the area of the matrix. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that the position of the accused’s offences was reflected by the red box as shown in the Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix below.

61     In _Masui_, Chan J also utilised the Contour Matrix where he identified the closest contour lines on the Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix to interpolate the range of indicative starting sentences. I agreed with the Prosecution that based on a broad interpolation from the Contour Matrix as shown below, the range of indicative starting sentences in this case was between seven to ten months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000 per charge.

![]([2021] SGDC 0285_Image/[2021] SGDC 0285_image2.png)

62     At Step 3, after arriving at an indicative sentencing range, Chan J went on to provide more discrete ranges of indicative starting sentences according to the differing amounts of gratification for each charge (see \[302\]). There was only one set of discrete ranges of indicative starting sentences in _Masui_ because at Step 4, Chan J did not make any adjustments to the initial discrete ranges as he was of the view that there were no offender-specific factors that warranted a downward adjustment (see \[312\]).

63     The Prosecution did not provide discrete ranges of its indicative starting sentences at Step 3. It came up with its final sentences for the individual charges at Step 4 of the _Masui_ framework, after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors[^28].

64     I had adopted the Prosecution’s approach and did not think it was necessary to set out more discrete indicative starting sentences at this juncture. After all, sentencing frameworks were intended to assist the court and not meant to be rigidly applied. Similarly, I would set out my final individual sentences according to the gratification amount after I had taken into account the offender-specific factors and the totality principle at Steps 4 and 5.

65     I turn now to the submissions of the Defence to explain why I did not agree with its proposed indicative starting sentences at Step 3. First, for the reasons I have given above at \[45\] to \[58\], I disagreed with the assessment of the Defence as to the specific level of harm and culpability of the accused at Step 1. Since the Defence would have lower inputs to apply to the Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix, the resulting indicative sentencing ranges would naturally be lower. Secondly, as I would elaborate below, in coming up with its substantially lower indicative starting sentencing ranges, the Defence had relied heavily[^29] on the case of _Ang Seng Thor_ which in my view was not a comparable sentencing precedent.

66     For completeness, I reproduce below the Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix and Contour Matrix submitted by the Defence[^30].

67     At Step 3, the Defence had followed _Masui_ and provided a table of discrete ranges of indicative starting sentences according to the differing amounts of gratification[^31]. The table is reproduced below.

68     The Defence stated expressly in its table that it was pegging its indicative starting imprisonment terms to the bribe amounts in _Ang Seng Thor_. _Ang Seng Thor_ was one of the cases which Chan J had used for backtesting the _Masui_ framework: at pages 181 to 183. Briefly, the offender Ang pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(b) of the Act. There were four charges taken into consideration which comprised two charges under s 6(b) of the Act and two charges under the Immigration Act. Ang had given respective bribes of $97,158 and $50,000 in the two proceeded charges. The total bribe quantum was $207,508.10 for the four corruption charges. He was sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment and fine of $25,000 per charge with the sentences to run consecutively, making a total of 12 weeks’ imprisonment and fine of $50,000.

69     Chan J, in backtesting this case, had determined an indicative starting sentence of three months’ imprisonment for the bribe of $97,158, and two months’ imprisonment for the bribe of $50,000. This formed the basis from which the Defence derived its indicative starting sentencing range of two weeks to 13 weeks’ imprisonment.

70     In my view, the facts in _Ang Seng Thor_ were clearly distinguishable from the facts in the present case. The offender in _Ang Seng Thor_ faced far fewer charges, total of four corruption charges as compared with the 59 charges preferred against the accused. The total quantum of bribes involved in _Ang Seng Thor_ was $207,508.10 as compared with the total amount of $879,853.63 in the 46 conspiracy charges or grand total of $901,946.11 in the 59 charges in the present case. The four offences in _Ang Seng Thor_ were committed sporadically between 2003 and 2005 while the 59 offences in this case were committed on a protracted basis between March 2014 and 23 March 2017. The offences in the present case were more sophisticated involving a group conspiracy. Further, the accused had caused fictitious invoices to be issued to cover up the offences. The Defence had therefore pegged its case unduly to a precedent which did not support its sentencing stance.

71     To sum up, at Steps 2 and 3 of the _Masui_ framework, I had agreed with the Prosecution’s inputs to the Modified-Harm Culpability Matrix (see \[60\] above). Upon interpolation using the contour matrix, I agreed with the Prosecution that the indicative starting sentences ranged between seven to ten months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000 per charge in this case (see \[61\] above). I disagreed with the Defence that the indicative starting sentences should range between two to 13 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000 per charge as it had downplayed the level of harm and culpability in this case and pegged its case to _Ang Seng Thor_ which was not an analogous precedent.

#### Whether additional fines should be imposed in the present case

72     After determining the indicative starting sentence for the imprisonment term for each charge, the court had to consider as part of Step 3 of the _Masui_ framework whether it was appropriate to impose an additional fine and if so, what the quantum should be: at \[282\]. In this regard, Chan J clarified that the Modified Harm-Culpability Matrix was primarily focused on helping a sentencing court determine the indicative starting imprisonment sentence and did not provide guidance as to the appropriate indicative quantum of fine to be imposed: at \[267\]. This issue was thus left to the sentencing court.

73     In _Masui_, Chan J was of the view that a fine of approximately 10% of the bribe received per charge would be appropriate, on top of the imprisonment term imposed for each of the charges before him. Since the fines would have a punitive and deterrent effect on the offenders, in _Masui_, Chan J accordingly reduced the indicative starting imprisonment term per charge by one month.

74     Counsel for the Defence submitted that since Chan J held in _Masui_ that fines should be imposed, similarly in the present case, the court should also impose fines. Likewise, on account of the imposition of fines which had a deterrent effect, the Defence submitted that there should be a one-week reduction in the overall final imprisonment sentence in this case.

75     Under s 6 of the Act, fines were discretionary. In deciding whether I should impose additional fines in this case, I considered whether there was a need to disgorge or confiscate any ascertainable profits which the accused might have made from his illegal behaviour: see _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ \[2014\] 4 SLR 893 at \[77\] to \[78\], _Koh Jaw Hung v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 516</span> at \[44\] and _Ding Si Yang and Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 229</span> at \[109\].

76     Under s 13 of the Act, where a court had convicted a person of an offence of acceptance of any gratification, if that gratification was a sum of money, it was mandatory for the court to order the person to pay as penalty the amount of that gratification. In the present case, the illegal profits of $191,115.89 which the accused made from his offences were thus the subject of a penalty order under s 13.

77     I noted that the accused had voluntarily surrendered his illegally obtained gratification of $191,115.89 to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”). There was therefore no necessity to impose an additional fine to disgorge or confiscate his illegal profits. I was also of the view that the imprisonment terms to be imposed in this case would serve as adequate deterrence and punishment.

78     Given my views above, I disagreed with the Defence that additional fines were warranted in this case.

### Steps 4 and 5 – Adjusting for offender-specific factors and the totality principle

79     At Step 4, the court was required to consider offender-specific factors which did not directly relate to the commission of the offences and adjust the indicative sentences upwards or downwards as appropriate. In _Masui_, Chan J cited various offender-specific factors stated in _Wong Chee Meng_ to be relevant for consideration: at \[284\].

80     In the present case, I found the following offender-specific factors to be relevant.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50%"> <col width="50%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Offender-specific factors</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Aggravating factors</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Mitigating factors</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">a) Offences TIC for sentencing purposes</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">a) A guilty plea</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">b) Co-operation with the authorities.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### Aggravating factors

81     I agreed with the Prosecution that the main aggravating factor was the 40 charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The amount of gratification involved in these 40 TIC charges was $324,787.04.

82     The effect of the TIC charges would be to increase the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the proceeded charges: see the Court of Appeal decision in _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> at \[38\]. Given that both the bribe amounts and the number of TIC charges were significant, an uplift in the sentence was warranted.

#### Mitigating factors

83     I summarise below the Mitigation Plea of the accused:

> (a)     The accused, aged 54, was married to a nurse with no children. He grew up in a poor household and started doing odd jobs when he was in Primary six. His mother passed away when he was a student and he had been supporting his elderly father aged 84. The accused financed himself through a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering at Singapore Polytechnic. After he completed his National Service, he worked as an engineering assistant and then moved on to several sales positions. He later took up night classes and graduated with a Graduate Diploma in marketing management from the Marketing Institute in Singapore.

> (b)     The accused subsequently started his own business and came up with his own design and brand of air winches. In 2006, he found his niche in selling his brand of air winches.

> (c)     In relation to the conspiracy charges, the accused did not meet or talk to Alvin. He had no influence over the tender process. His communication was limited to Raj who had requested the accused to refer vendors to him. The accused was then to share the “referral fees” from the vendors with Raj and Alvin.

> (d)     In respect of the charges relating to Raj, the accused was at Rotating’s premises in 2014 to discuss work matters when Raj approached the accused and told him to contact Rotating’s purchasing manager as Rotating was looking to buy certain hardware. Raj requested for referral fees should the accused manage to secure contracts from Rotating. The Defence highlighted that Rotating had only approved two quotations from the accused, but the accused had extended three bribes to Raj because there were two payment terms under the first contract.

> (e)     In respect of the charges relating to Ong, the accused deeply regretted asking Ong to use 3W to invoice Titan and Growa instead of keeping to Megamarine’s letterhead.

> (f)     When the accused was called up to attend the first interview at CPIB, he had “apologetically confessed” to the conspiracy charges. He also co-operated with CPIB by giving CPIB the records he kept of the payments he received from the vendors and the payments he made to Raj and Alvin “immediately and voluntarily” (see \[40\] of the Final Mitigation Plea & Written Submissions dated 4 August 2021).

> (g)     The charges relating to Raj had nothing to do with the investigations, but the accused had volunteered the information to CPIB even though there was no documentary proof of the offences. The accused had thus “whistle blown” and confessed to these charges (see \[41\] of Final Mitigation Plea & Written Submissions dated 4 August 2021).

> (h)     The charges relating to Spectrama and Growa were originally not part of the investigations. The accused showed the CPIB officers Megamarine’s marked-up invoices to Spectrama and Growa and identified the co-accused Stanley and Ahmad. Thus, he had “partially whistle blown” for the charges relating to Spectrama and Growa (see \[42\] of Final Mitigation Plea & Written Submissions dated 4 August 2021).

> (i)     The accused did not “whistle blow” to the charges relating to Ong and the conspiracy charges relating to Titan however he assisted in revealing the details (see \[43 – 44 of Final Mitigation Plea & Written Submissions dated 4 August 2021).

> (j)     The accused also furnished his accounts, cheque buds, bank statements and other documents to CPIB. The accused was at the beck and call of the CPIB officers. He attended at CPIB more than a dozen times to provide clarifications and confirmations regarding the corruption.

> (k)     The accused entered a timeous unqualified plea of guilt. He was untraced and of good character. His voluntary disgorgement of $191,115.89 was a demonstration of his remorse. The accused had also offered himself to be a prosecution witness.

> (l)     The accused was renting a condominium, but his business and voluntary disgorgement had caused him to take a big financial hit. He and his wife had since downgraded to stay in a 3-room HDB flat.

84     I agreed with the Prosecution that the significant mitigating factors in this case would be the accused’s full co-operation with CPIB and his early plea of guilt. He had demonstrated genuine remorse by coming clean on his wrongdoings, rendering every assistance he could by furnishing the evidence in his possession, and expressing his willingness to be a prosecution witness. In this regard, notwithstanding that his illicit gain of $191,115.89 would have been the subject of a penalty order under s 13 of the Act, I viewed his voluntary and proactive disgorgement of the bribes although it came about only after he was charged[^32] as being consistent with his remorse.

85     As for whether his confessions regarding the offences which were originally not part of the investigations ought to be considered as “partial whistle blowing” and therefore a relevant mitigating factor, I noted that the Prosecution disagreed with the characterisation by the Defence. The Prosecution described a whistleblower as someone who went to the authorities and gave them first information which then triggered an investigation[^33]. The Prosecution pointed out that the accused did not go to CPIB on his own initiative. He was called up by CPIB for investigations after he had already committed the offences and profited from them and then he decided to confess to his deeds.

86     In _Ang Seng Thor_ at \[57\], the High Court reiterated the mitigating value in an offender surrendering himself to the authorities even before investigations had caught up with him, as recognised by Yong CJ in _PP v Siew Boon Loong_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 611</span> at \[15\] – \[18\]. It acknowledged that if there were mitigating value in proactively disclosing one’s own crimes to the authorities, there must be even more in disclosing the crimes of one’s accomplices at the same time. The High Court in _Ang Seng Thor_ observed that our courts had not previously had the opportunity to consider in detail the exact mitigating value to be given for whistleblowing. Nonetheless, it decided that an explication of the applicable principles was not necessary in _Ang Seng Thor_ as it did not find the offender deserving of the honorific distinction of being called a “whistleblower”: at \[58\]. While the High Court did not provide an exhaustive definition of the term in _Ang Seng Thor_, on the facts it found several key features that distinguished the offender Ang from the archetypal whistleblower. For example, Ang did not directly implicate himself in his initial disclosures to the board of directors. His disclosures focused on alleged wrongdoings by other persons. Ang only admitted personal wrongdoing directly when he was placed under investigation by CPIB later. Ang also did not at any point voluntarily contact CPIB or any other authority. Therefore, beyond recognising Ang’s high degree of cooperation with CPIB after he was placed under investigation as well as his early plea of guilt, the High Court did not accord the offender in _Ang Seng Thor_ any additional mitigation: at \[59\] to \[61\].

87     In the present case, the accused similarly owned up and took responsibility for all his crimes only after he had had been summoned by CPIB for investigations. I was therefore not inclined to consider him as a whistleblower. To his credit, he had co-operated fully with CPIB and entered his guilty plea at an early stage, and I had given significant weight to these mitigating factors.

88     I shall next deal with the other submissions raised by the Defence to explain why I did not consider them to be mitigating factors:

> (a)     Although the accused was untraced, he could not be regarded a first offender seeing how he had committed 59 offences over a sustained period of time.

> (b)     While the accused did not communicate directly with Alvin and had no influence over the tender process at KFELS, he was in a conspiracy with Alvin who was able to influence the tender process (see \[2.a.\] and 4 of the SOF).

> (c)     The Defence argued that the accused was of good character thus justifying a discount in sentence. However, as pointed out by the Prosecution, nothing had been raised here which rose to the level recognised in caselaw where one’s significant contributions in society and good character could be regarded as a mitigating factor such as in the case of the Venerable Shi Ming Yi where the court took into account his risking of life and limb to raise millions for charity[^34]. In _Goh Kah Heng (alias Shi Ming Yi) v Public Prosecutor and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 258</span> (“_Shi Ming Yi”_), the High Court recognised the sterling credentials of the offender Shi Ming Yi who had performed dangerous stunts to raise funds for Ren Ci. The High Court noted that the millions of dollars raised from public donations had been used by Ren Ci over the years for poor and chronically ill people: at \[93\] to \[97\]. Conversely, the Defence had not adduced any such evidence of good character in this case.

> (d)     Furthermore, as the High Court had held in _Ang Peng Tiam v Singapore Medical Council and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 356</span> (“_Ang Peng Tiam_”) at \[101\], an offender’s general good character or his past contributions to society could not be regarded as a mitigating factor if it rested on the notion that it reflected the moral worth of the offender. First, it was not for the court to judge the moral worth of such offenders. Second, these considerations generally had no relevance to the offender’s culpability or the harm that he had caused. Third, treating contributions to society as mitigating might be perceived as unfairly favouring the privileged who would be better placed to make such contributions as compared to the less privileged offenders.

89     I shall briefly refer to counsel’s initial submissions that the court should regard the accused’s hardship post-sentence as a mitigating factor. The Defence pointed out that the accused would be disqualified from being appointed as a director or being involved with management for five years after his release from prison pursuant to ss 154(1) and (4)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap 50). Thus, he would not be able to participate in the corporate and banking systems. Counsel for the Defence was fully aware of and had cited the case of _Chua Kin Leng Timothy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 74</span> (“_Chua Kin Leng_”) which concerned a _Romel_ cateogry 2 corruption[^35]. Yong Pung How CJ held at \[39\] in _Chua Kin Leng_ that the inability to be appointed as a director for five years could not be considered a proper mitigating factor. As Yong CJ had stated, if being a director was of such importance, then the offender should not have even committed any bribery offence to begin with, let alone a string of similar offences over two years. Counsel for the Defence had originally argued that _Chua Kin Leng_ did not apply to _Romel_ category 1 cases. Yong CJ clearly did not make any exception across the different categories of corruption where the consequential disqualification as a director would count as a mitigating factor. I noted that the Defence had rightly withdrawn this submission[^36].

#### Mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factors

90     In my view, the mitigating factors in this case outweighed the aggravating factors. I therefore adjusted the indicative starting sentence from seven to ten months imprisonment per charge downwards to a final sentencing range of between four to nine months’ imprisonment per charge.

91     Although the Prosecution did not state so explicitly, it was evident that the Prosecution had also assessed that the mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factors because it had adjusted its indicative starting sentence of seven to ten months’ imprisonment per charge downwards to a sentencing range between 5.5 months’ imprisonment to 9.5 months’ imprisonment per charge[^37]. By this point, I believed it would be more appropriate to refer to the adjusted sentencing range as the final sentencing range. I did not agree with the Prosecution’s final sentencing range because the final individual sentences according to its range (see Annex B) turned out to be on the high side and inconsistent with the relevant precedents. I would elaborate on the relevant precedents later.

92     The Defence did not provide an updated final sentencing range as such, but it presented its final individual sentences for the 19 proceeded charges by way of a table[^38] which is reproduced at Annex C.

93     The Defence explained that it obtained its final sentences by following Chan J’s analysis of _Ang Seng Thor_ in _Masui_. Chan J was of the view that a significant downward adjustment of the indicative sentences in _Ang Seng Thor_ was warranted on account of offender Ang’s high degree of cooperation with the authorities and Ang’s early plea of guilt. The Defence argued that that the present case also merited a 35% discount in sentence given that the facts in _Ang Seng Thor_ and the facts in this case shared many similarities[^39].

94     As I have stated at \[70\] above, the facts in _Ang Thor Seng_ were very different from the facts in the present case. Suffice it for me to say that the final sentences proposed by the Defence for the conspiracy charges were wholly inadequate and not supported by the relevant precedents which I would be referring to.

#### Charges relating to Raj and Ong (non-conspiracy charges)

95     The final sentencing range of four months to nine months’ imprisonment per charge that I determined and the final sentencing range of 5.5 months to 9.5 months’ imprisonment per charge derived by the Prosecution were in respect of the conspiracy charges.

96     In respect of the charges relating to Raj and Ong which involved bribes ranging from $2,308.32 to $3,000, the Prosecution had proposed final sentences of three weeks’ imprisonment each for these charges based on the precedents in _Public Prosecutor v Yong Hock Guan Dennis_ (“_Dennis Yong_”) <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 12</span>, _Public Prosecutor v Neo Kian Siong_ (unreported) and _Li Chaoyun & Tam Yit Ngor v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 215</span> (“Li Chaoyun”)[^40]_ where imprisonment terms between two weeks and six weeks were imposed for bribes varying from $1,000 to $3,000.

97     Where the Defence was concerned, it accepted that imprisonment terms were warranted for the charges relating to Ong because the offences were connected to the conspiracy. However, it argued that the proceeded charge relating to Raj in DAC-920855-2020 arose from a different factual matrix and whistle blown by the accused hence the Defence contended that a fine would be adequate. In this regard, I noted that the Defence had been inconsistent in its submissions of what the appropriate fine should be. It originally submitted for a fine of $6,000 for DAC-920855-2020 which was twice the quantum of the bribe in the charge[^41]. It eventually submitted that an appropriate fine for this charge was $3,000 which was the same quantum as the gratification[^42].

98     Although the Prosecution took the position that a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate for DAC-920855-2020, if the court was contemplating a fine, it submitted that the appropriate fine would be $15,000. It reached this view by considering Chan J’s backtesting analysis of _Heng Tze Yong v Public Prosecutor_ \[2017\] 5 SLR 0976[^43]_(“Heng Tze Yong”)_ in _Masui_ where Chan J held that a high fine of three times the total amount of gratification would be appropriate. In this case, the Prosecution submitted that a multiplier of five times rather than three was appropriate given the accused’s more significant period of offending and the greater overall quantum of gratification as opposed to the two charges and total gratification of $10,000 in _Heng Tze Yong_.

99     The question was whether a fine would serve as sufficient punishment and deterrence for DAC-920855-2020. I noted that this charge was amongst the earliest offences committed by the accused prior to the conspiracy charges. Nonetheless, having regard to the accused’s overall criminality, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed for this charge. Since the accused had come clean on the offences relating to Raj, I was of the view that a sentence of one week’s imprisonment would be appropriate. To be clear, even if I were to impose a fine, following _Heng Tze Yong_, it would have to be a high fine of at least $10,000 to $15,000 for the sentence to be meaningful. A fine of $3,000 as proposed by the Defence would be manifestly inadequate.

100    As for the three proceeded charges relating to Ong where the accused gave bribes between $2,308.32 and $2,997.12, I agreed with the Defence that a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment per charge would be fair. However, as I have explained above, I did not think it was necessary to impose conjunctive fines to achieve a punitive and deterrent effect on the accused.

#### Final sentences according to the gratification amounts after adjusting for offender-specific factors at Step 4

101    I set out below the final sentences that I had determined according to the differing amounts of gratification in this case.

#### Totality principle at Step 5

102    After determining the final sentences for each charge at Step 4, at Step 5 of the _Masui_ framework, the sentencing court must have regard to the totality principle in arriving at the global sentence for the offender.

103    We would recall that the Prosecution had recommended that six imprisonment terms should run consecutively. It submitted that this was to take into account the sustained period of offending, multiplicity of offences and to give weight to the need to send a strong deterrent message to disabuse and deter an attitude of casually treating corrupting as a cost of doing business. From Annex B, I noted that the Prosecution had suggested that the six consecutive sentences should consist of one sentence each from the vendors Keh Choon/Titan and Stanley/Spectrama, two sentences from the vendor Ahmad/Growa, one sentence from Ong and the sentence in relation to Raj.

104    On the other hand, the Defence had submitted that four imprisonment terms should run consecutively comprising one charge from each vendor under the conspiracy and one charge relating to Ong as the charges faced by the accused could be divided into five sets of facts except that the charge relating to Raj where the accused had whistle blown should only be given a fine.

105    Under s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, at least two of the imprisonment terms must be ordered to run consecutively. Given the multiple charges in this case and that the accused was involved in three sets of corrupt dealings over a total period of three years, it would be insufficient to only order the minimum two sentences to run consecutively. I also agreed with the Prosecution that a strong deterrent message was necessary to discourage corruption as a way of conducting business. I was of the view that it would be just to run five sentences consecutively to reflect the totality of the accused’s corrupt criminal conduct. I therefore ordered one sentence from each vendor, one sentence from the charges relating to Ong and the charge relating to Raj to run consecutively.

## Sentences imposed by the court

106    For the foregoing reasons, I sentenced the accused to the following imprisonment terms with a global sentence of 17 months and 3 weeks’ imprisonment. For easy reference, I set out below the sentences imposed by the court against the final sentencing positions of the Prosecution and the Defence.

## Sentences imposed were consistent with relevant precedents

107    To ensure that the individual sentences and aggregate sentence that I imposed in this case were reasonable, I also had regard to the precedents tendered by the parties. I considered primarily the more recent _Romel_ category 1 precedents which had been heard on appeal in the High Court and I was satisfied that the sentences imposed in the present case were in line with these precedents.

108    There were two High Court precedents which I found to be relevant. The first case of _PP v Geow Chwee Hiam (“Geow”)_ was relevant to show that a bribe between $20,000 and $30,000 was likely to attract an imprisonment term of about four months’ imprisonment. _Geow_ was mentioned in passing by Chan J in _Masui_: at page 168 at \[A.11\]. I picked _Geow_ because there were no other High Court _Romel_ category 1 precedents cited by the parties which dealt with this range of bribes.

109    The second case of _Li Chaoyun_ was recently heard on appeal in the High Court on 6 May 2021. It was relevant in that both appellants there also faced numerous charges (34 charges each) and the total bribe amount of $956,600 was comparable to the total bribe amount of $879,853.63 (for 46 conspiracy charges) or $901,946.11 (for all 59 charges) in this case. _Li Chaoyun_ concerned bribes between $1,200 and $255,000 which encompassed the range of bribes of between $2,308.32 and $107,000 that featured in the proceeded charges in the present case. _Li Chaoyun_ would illustrate the range of sentences that had been imposed for similar amounts.

110    I set out below the salient facts in _Geow_ and _Li Chaoyun._

111    The following sentencing ranges could be gleaned from _Geow_ and _Li Chaoyun_. The sentences that I imposed were well within these ranges.

112    The Defence tendered a total of five precedents including _Ang Seng Thor_ which it grounded its sentencing position on. I have already distinguished _Ang Seng Thor_. The other four precedents cited by the Defence were _Masui_, _Michael Tan_, _PP v Peter Khoo Chong Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 453</span> (“_Peter Khoo_”) and _Tee Fook Boon Andrew v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 192</span> (“_Andrew Tee_”). In my view, these precedents were not relevant. _Masui_ was a _Romel_ category 3 case. _Michael Tan_ was not a pure private sector corruption case because it involved corruption of foreign public nationals. _Peter Khoo_ was a district court decision for which there was no appeal. Lastly, _Andrew Tee_ was a High Court case decided in 2011. The offender in _Andrew Tee_ faced 80 charges of giving bribes totalling $2,389,322.47 over six and a half years. The offender pleaded guilty to 12 charges with the rest to be taken into consideration. He made restitution of $1 million. He was initially sentenced to a total of four months’ imprisonment and a fine of $180,000. On appeal, the High Court enhanced his sentence from four months to 40 weeks’ imprisonment (approximately 10 months’ imprisonment) with the fine to remain. I agreed with the Prosecution that _Andrew Tee_ was of limited precedential value because it was a dated precedent which was decided before _Romel_ and in view of the staggering amounts of bribes involved in _Andrew Tee_, the sentence imposed would seem out of keeping with the recent precedents[^44].

## Status of the cases against the six co-accused

113    The accused and Stanley (director of Spectrama) were the first two persons to be dealt with. The cases against the remaining five co-accused namely Raj, Alvin, Keh Choon, Ahmad and Ong were pending at pre-trial conference stage.

114    The co-accused, Stanley, pleaded guilty before me in the same proceedings as the accused. Stanley faced a total of 21 charges as the corrupt giver under s 6(b) of the Act. He pleaded guilty to seven proceeded charges and consented to have the remaining 14 charges TIC for the purpose of sentencing.

115    Briefly, in Stanley’s case, I assessed harm to be slight (middle to upper end of slight harm) and culpability to be medium (middle to upper end of medium). I agreed with both the Prosecution and counsel for Stanley that Stanley’s culpability was lower than that of the accused. Finally, after adjusting for the mitigating and aggravating factors and having regard to the totality principle, I was of the view that Stanley’s final sentencing range per charge was between 1½ months to four months’ imprisonment and a fine of up to $100,000. I sentenced Stanley to an aggregate sentence of nine months’ imprisonment with three imprisonment terms to run consecutively. As regards whether fines should be imposed, both the Prosecution and counsel for Stanley agreed that it was not appropriate to impose additional fines as there was difficulty quantifying the amount of benefits Stanley derived from the corrupt scheme. As such, I did not impose any fines on Stanley. No appeal arose from Stanley’s case.

116    The sentences received by Stanley are set out below.

## Conclusion

117    For the reasons I have stated above, I was satisfied that on the facts of this case, an aggregate sentence of 17 months and three weeks’ imprisonment was fair and reasonable. I did not think that I should order the accused to pay additional fines as this was not an appropriate case for fines to be imposed. Besides, I was of the view that the overall imprisonment term was sufficient punishment. As regards the penalty under s 13 of the Act, the accused had made voluntary disgorgement of his illicit profits.

118    The accused is presently on bail pending his appeal.

A.1    Aside from the incorrect computation of the global sentence using the precedents-based approach, the Prosecution had also not been consistent in its position regarding the final sentences for the individual proceeded charges. This would be evident from comparing the Prosecution’s final sentencing range of 5.5 months’ imprisonment to 9.5 months’ imprisonment per charge to its final sentences for the individual proceeded charges. I give two examples. First example, according to its table of (final) starting sentences at \[40\] of Prosecution’s Skeletal Submissions on Sentence dated 25 January 2021, the imprisonment sentence for bribes ranging from $20,000 to $30,000 should be 5.5 months’ imprisonment. However, in its application, Prosecution’s final sentence for the bribe amount of $21,835.41 in DAC-920824-2020 was five to six months’ imprisonment. Second example, according to its table of (final) starting sentences, the imprisonment sentence for bribes ranging between $40,000 and $50,000 should be 7.5 months’ imprisonment but its final sentence for the bribe amount of $40,086.48 in DAC-920849-2020 was seven to eight months’ imprisonment.
