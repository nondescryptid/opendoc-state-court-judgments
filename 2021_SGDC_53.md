3       The key area of sentencing contention between the parties is whether the custodial threshold had been crossed for the market rigging charges under s 197(1)(b) SFA. Defence counsel further submitted that the length of the prosecution’s proposed custodial terms were, in any event manifestly excessive.

4       For the s 201(b) SFA charge, both sides agreed that a fine was appropriate but differed as to the quantum of the fine.

## Statement of Facts

5       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”).

## Charges taken into consideration for sentencing

6       The accused agreed to 11 charges, comprising 10 charges under s 197(1)(b) SFA (also relating to market rigging of Gaylin shares) and one charge under s 182 PC (relating to the giving of a false statement to a Commercial Affairs Officer that one Khawaja Asif Rahman had never given the accused any trading mandate for his trading accounts), to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Antecedents

7       The accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s submission on sentence

8       The prosecution submitted that the High Court, through the seminal cases of _Ng Geok Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 913</span> (“_Ng Geok Eng_”) and _PP v Ng Sae Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 167</span> (“_Ng Sae Kiat_”) has taken a stern view of market rigging/false trading offences under s 197 SFA.

9       The prosecution submitted that deterrence would be the dominant sentencing principle for market rigging offences as enunciated by the High Court in _Ng Geok Eng_ and _Ng Sae Kiat_ and a custodial term was the appropriate sentence for each s 197(1)(b) SFA charge in the present case. It sought a global sentence of 16 to 20 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 197(1)(b) SFA charges (comprising 5-6 weeks for the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 14th 15th charges and 6-8 weeks for the 16th and 17th charges, with the sentences of the 3rd, 15th and 17th charges to run consecutively). The prosecution sought a fine of $40,000 for the s 201(b) charge.

10     The prosecution’s proposed sentences were as follows:

## Mitigation

11     Defence counsel accepted the prosecution's submission that “it is of utmost importance to maintain the integrity of the capital markets in Singapore and that the courts should take a stern view of market misconduct cases and impose deterrent sentences to deter other like-minded offenders.”

12     Defence counsel submitted however, that deterrence could equally be served by high fines in lieu of a custodial sentence and on the facts of the present case, high fines would be sufficient deterrence taking into account the minimal/non harm and low culpability of the accused.

13     Defence counsel cited a number of District Court cases post-_Ng Geok Eng_ where fines had been imposed by the District Courts and submitted that the facts of the present case were less serious than those cases. These were the cases of _PP v Siow It Loong & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 306</span> (“_Siow It Loong_”), _PP v Franco Giuseppe_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 184</span> (“_Franco Giuseppe_”), _PP v Lee Siew Ngan_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 100</span> (“_Lee Siew Ngan_”), _PP v Ng See Kim Kelvin & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 141</span> (“_Ng See Kim_”) and the unreported case of _PP v Vincent Tan Kim Yong_, DAC No. 12909/2011 (“_Vincent Tan_”).

14     Defence counsel cited several reported cases where custodial sentences had been meted out and submitted that the facts of the present case were nowhere as serious as those cases to justify the custodial terms sought by the prosecution.

15     Defence counsel submitted that the accused’s ill health was a further factor which mitigated against a custodial sentence.

16     Defence counsel accordingly sought a global fine of $160,000. This comprised a fine of $20,000 for each of the seven s 197(1)(b) SFA charges proceeded on, totalling $140,000 and a fine of $20,000 for the s 201 (b) SFA charge.

## The court’s decision on sentence

17     I first examine the offence specific factors which go to harm and culpability for the offences under s 197(1)(b) SFA followed by offender specific factors.

### Offence specific factors

#### Harm

18     Harm can be measured in terms of market impact as a result of the accused’s conduct. In _Ng Sae Kiat_, Chao JA held at \[55\]:

>     In our judgment, **market impact should be understood to refer to some form of distortion of the true forces of supply and demand in the financial market which causes the information that is conveyed on the market to be distorted**. Such distortion should have the potential to mislead the general investing public. Market misconduct that results in such an outcome would be particularly deleterious for public investors given Singapore’s regulatory shift to a disclosure-based regime, where pertinent information is required to be made publicly available, and investors are by and large left to safeguard their own interests when making decisions on how and when to invest. **Distortion of market information could potentially cause public investors to be misled and hence incur losses**.

>     \[emphasis added\]

19     Paragraph 17 of the SOF sets out the market impact of the accused’s conduct:

>      **The accused’s trades had the effect of propping up the closing price of Gaylin Shares, which would have closed lower had it not been for the accused’s actions. Not only did the accused set a higher closing price on that day, his trades slowed down and mitigated the decline in prices of Gaylin Shares.** The table below compares the price difference between the closing price of Gaylin Shares set by the accused and the closing price of Gaylin Shares on the previous trading day. On most occasions, the accused successfully caused an increase in the share prices, but, given the overall declining trend of share prices, the accused was occasionally only able to cause a reduction in the fall of share prices as compared to the previous trading day’s closing price.

20     Further, the accused managed to cause the price of Gaylin shares to close higher than the _same day_ preceding transaction trade price which would have been the closing price had the accused not intervened. In terms of the proceeded charges, he caused the _same day_ preceding transaction trade price to close higher for the 3rd (15 Feb 2016 trade), 8th (10 March 2016 trade), 14th (28 April 2016 trade), 15th (6 May 2016 trade), 16th (19 Sep 2016 trade) charges by 23.2%, 19.3%, 19.6%, 17.6% and 38.6% respectively. This can be illustrated as follows:

21     For the 6th (8 March 2016 trade) and 17th (10 October 2016 trade) proceeded charges, he caused the closing price to be 27.8% and 31.7% higher respectively than the _previous day_ closing price. The upshot is that the accused caused the Gaylin share price for _all_ seven proceeded s 197(1)(b) SFA charges to close higher either with regard to the closing price of the previous day and/or the same day preceding trade price.

22     Gaylin shares had become increasingly illiquid over the years and the prices of Gaylin Shares (see paragraph 15 of the SOF) and had been on a general decline over the years (as reflected in the graph at paragraph 16 of the SOF) from around S$0.60 per share in 2014 to slightly over S$0.15 per share in 2016.

23     Paragraph 19 of the SOF explains how the accused was able to influence the price of Gaylin shares in view of the fact that it was thinly traded:

>     The accused’s trades on the 17 occasions involved the purchase of 100 to 200 shares to set the closing price for Gaylin Shares. However, as set out in the table below, notwithstanding the small quantity of shares involved, these small trades generally constituted a significant proportion of the market volume for Gaylin Shares, as Gaylin Shares were generally very thinly traded by then. For instance, such small trades accounted for 50 percent or more of the market volume for Gaylin Shares on 10 of the 17 occasions.

24     The fact that Gaylin shares were thinly traded was itself a neutral factor, as this is a function of the market’s view of Gaylin shares. That said, if the accused’s trades, even if it was a single, low volume trade on a specific day, caused the price of Gaylin shares to increase by a larger percentage because it is thinly traded, then it would be fair to say that the degree of market impact caused by the accused is greater than in a case where his trades did not result in as large a share price movement where the shares are heavily traded.

25     Further, even on days when Gaylin shares were significantly more heavily traded, the accused was still able to influence and increase Gaylin’s share price through his trades. On 11 November 2015 when the accused trade resulted in Gaylin shares being 2.5%% higher than the closing price of the previous day, even though the accused’s trade only accounted for 0.05% of market volume. On 25 April 2016, the accused’s trade resulted in Gaylin shares being 4.8% higher than the closing price of the previous day, even though the accused’s trade only accounted for 0.05% of market volume.

26     In my judgment, there was clearly market impact with respect to the accused’s market rigging of Gaylin shares. This is set out at paragraphs 12 and 17 of the SOF to which the accused had admitted to:

>     These purchases in small quantities, or small trades, executed by Mdm Chua on the accused’s instructions, caused the Gaylin Share prices to close at 6.5% to 38.6% higher than they would have if the accused had not caused those trades to be executed.

>     …

>     The accused’s trades had the effect of propping up the closing price of Gaylin Shares, which would have closed lower had it not been for the accused’s actions.

27     While there was no identifiable pecuniary loss to any single investor in this case, such loss, if identified, would be an additional aggravating factor. That did not detract from the fact that there had been market impact caused by the accused’s actions. As identified in _Ng Sae Kiat_, potential loss to investors is also a factor to be considered:

>      **….**market impact should be understood to refer to some form of distortion of the true forces of supply and demand in the financial market which causes the information that is conveyed on the market to be distorted. **Such distortion should have the potential to mislead the general investing public**.

28     In the present case, this is stated in the SOF for each proceeded charge:

>      _…the accused caused the purchase to be made with the purpose of creating a misleading appearance with respect to the price of Gaylin Shares, by presenting an artificial demand for Gaylin Shares in order to cause Gaylin Shares to close at a higher price._

29     In my view, the artificial demand generated by the accused distorted the true forces of supply and demand which caused Gaylin’s share price to close higher but for the accused’s actions. I should add although Gaylin was generally a thinly traded counter at the material time, there were days when there were substantial market volume such as on 11 November 2015 and 16 April 2016 when 200,200 and 20,100 Gaylin shares were traded by investors. The misleading appearance was the signal to potential investors that the price of Gaylin was higher than it should have been and had the potential to mislead them as to the true market value of Gaylin shares.

30     The market impact in the present case can be contrasted with that in _Siow It Loong_ where the offenders had manipulated the underlying securities of warrants in order to cause the price of the said warrants to move in their favour. Crucially, the offences in _Siow It Loong_ occurred on _a single day_ within a short period of time and the market impact was hence limited to a single day of trading as opposed to the current case where there were 17 instances of market rigging over a period close to one year between 11 November 2015 to 25 October 2016.

#### Culpability

31     The accused employed three methods of market rigging. These are stated at para 13 of the SOF as follows:

> (a)      **Method 1** – purchasing Gaylin shares at the best ask price _ten minutes before the closing routine commences_ (_i.e._ by placing buy orders between 16:50 hours and 17:00 hours for a full-day trading session and between 12:20 hours and 12:30 hours for a half-day trading session);

> (b)      **Method 2** – placing buy orders of Gaylin shares to raise the closing price _during the closing routine_, a session which lasts up to 6 minutes after trading stops for the day (_i.e._ by placing buy orders after 17:00 hours for a full-day trading session and after 12:30 hours for a half-day trading session); and

> (c)      **Method 3** – purchasing Gaylin shares at the best ask price _during the trading day but before the window for Method 1 above_ (_i.e._ from 09:00 hours to 16:50 hours for a full-day trading session and from 09:00 hours to 12:20 hours for a half-day trading session).

32     The SOF stated that the accused’s trades on the 17 occasions had the effect of incurring disproportionate and uneconomical brokerage fees which ranged from 27.15% to 70.53% of the value of the trades. All 17 small trades incurred the minimum brokerage fee of S$40, which applied to trade values of S$8,000 or less. In this regard, I agree with the prosecution’s submission that no rational investor would want to incur such high brokerage fees as it would cut into his or her cost of share purchase. The only inference that can be drawn for the accused incurring such disproportionate and uneconomical brokerage fees was that the trades were for the purposes of market rigging.

33     In _Ng Geok Eng_, similar market rigging conduct was undertaken by the offender as observed by the High Court at \[75\]:

>     The appellant’s relevant conduct fell within the category of malpractice generally referred to as “**marking the close”. This term is used to refer to the practice of making a purchase or sale of a security near the close of a day’s trading to alter the closing price of the security**. This might be done to avoid margin calls, **to support a flagging share price** or to affect the valuation of a portfolio.

>     \[emphasis added\]

34     The accused conduct in the present case of “marking the close” was to support the flagging share price of Gaylin shares.

35     The SOF makes clear that apart from maintaining his standing and reputation amongst his clientele as the motivation behind his actions, the accused was also the beneficial owner, through Rhodus Capital Limited (“RCL”), of 12.3 million Gaylin Shares held by RCL. Further, the accused was also the beneficial owner of more than 7 million Gaylin Shares in Lim Teck Chuan’s UOB Kay Hian account. As such, the accused’s market rigging offences had the effect of setting an artificially higher closing price in respect of the Gaylin Shares, with the result that he benefited by having his portfolio of Gaylin Shares reflecting a higher market value.

36     Defence counsel submitted that the accused’s trades were not a result of detailed and careful planning nor were they premeditated. Instead, the accused had made those infringing trades on the spur of the moment in a haphazard, sporadic and ad hoc basis.

37     While it is true that the accused did not engage in market rigging every single trading day during the relevant period between 11 November 2015 to 25 October 2016, there was a singular overall underlying motive by the accused, which was to support the flagging price of Gaylin shares. To this end, it was not a one-off trade but 17 market rigging trades conducted over nearly a year. Further, the accused clearly demonstrated an understanding and ability on how to rig the market through the three methods of market rigging employed, which were effective in increasing the price of Gaylin shares. To his credit, defence counsel candidly admitted that the accused’s multiple instances of market rigging was not in his favour.

38     While the accused was not in a position of trust such as being an officer holder of Gaylin, that would be an additional aggravating factor and would not be a mitigating factor in itself.

39     In the present case, the accused acted alone. The question was whether the accused, by acting alone in this case, was less culpable than a market rigging case with multiple offenders. To this end, defence counsel submitted that while the accused did not act in conspiracy with anyone else, he was not suggesting that it made him less culpable or that it was a mitigating factor _per se_.

40     I note that there is no proposition that all offences committed by a group will invariably attract sentences of greater severity than if the offences were committed by an individual - see _PP v Tey Thean Yang Dennis_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 120</span> at \[27\]:

>     Learned counsel made much of the fact that there was coordination between the two offenders in _Siow It Loong_. **There is no proposition that all offences committed by a group will invariably attract sentences of greater severity than if the offences were committed by an individual** (see _Tan Kay Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> at \[20\]). In my judgment, the offenders in _Siow It Loong_ had a lower degree of moral culpability and the circumstances of the offending were objectively less serious compared to the instant case.

>     \[emphasis added\]

41     What is relevant in that in a multiple offender cases of market rigging, there may well be offenders with differing levels of culpability depending on their role

42     In _Franco Giuseppe_ the offender was the Chief Financial Officer of a company known as Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings (“PPH”). On the instructions of his superiors, the accused actively traded in PPH's shares in order to maintain PPH's share price as the shares were to be used as consideration for an acquisition. The offender pleaded guilty to three insider trading charges and the two market rigging charges. For the market rigging charges, the accused was sentenced to a $80,000 fine on each charge. Significantly, the court accepted that the offender was “merely a conduit” for his superiors’ instructions to the bank executing the trades and _had no discretion or autonomy_ at all.

43     In _Ng See Kim_, the two offenders were UOB Kay Hian trading representatives who had assisted a finance manager of Chuan Soon Huat Industrial Group Ltd (“CSH”) to prop up CSH’s share price by ‘marking the close’. The two offenders were sentenced to a fine of S$200,000 and S$180,000 respectively. Significantly, the court took the view that the two offenders’ roles were confined to “executing the purchases as per the instructions given by the mastermind, one Lee Siew Ngan and that they had not made any further purchases on their own or actively induced or encouraged her into committing the offence”.

44     Given that the accused acted alone in the present case, he would not be able to maintain that he was merely a conduit or a secondary player.

### Offender specific factors

#### The accused’s lack of cooperation with the authorities

45     In _Ng See Kim_ the court also observed that the offenders in that case were _(i)_ cooperative and rendered full cooperation to the authorities; and _(ii)_ suffered from an undue delay in prosecution for about five years after admitting their complicity in the offences.

46     The offender in _Lee Siew Ngan_ was the mastermind of the same market rigging scheme which formed the subject matter of the prosecution in _Ng See Kim_. She pleaded guilty to one count under s 197(1) SFA read with s 109 PC and was sentenced to a fine of S$250,000. In coming to his decision on sentence, the court took into account the long delay in prosecuting the offender, as well concerns about sentencing parity, as the offenders in _Ng See Kim_ had been sentenced to fines.

47     The prosecution distinguished the present case from _Ng See Kim_ and _Lee Siew Ngan_ where there had been cooperation on the offenders and delay on the prosecution’s part in terms of investigation. The prosecution emphasized in the SOF that any delay in the present case was due to the lack of cooperation of the accused. As stated at paragraphs 51 to 54 of the SOF, the accused’s non cooperation with the authorities required a significant amount of resources to be expended for this case:

>     The accused was interviewed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore between 23 August 2017 and 28 June 2018. He was uncooperative throughout the course of investigations and denied manipulating the price of shares issued by Gaylin. The accused claimed that he was helping his friends Lim, Asif and Zheng to manage their investments and accumulate Gaylin shares through their three trading accounts maintained with UOBKH.

>     Arising out of the accused’s uncooperative behaviour, additional investigative resources were expended in order to uncover evidence of the accused’s offences. Amongst other things, the investigation officers (“IOs”) conducted further interviews with the accused and witnesses such as Chua, Lim, Asif and Gaylin’s former CEO Desmond Teo to establish the scope of the accused’s market manipulation activities.

>     In preparing for interviews with the relevant individuals, the IOs embarked on substantial evidence-gathering efforts. For example, they retrieved bank and trading statements from relevant financial institutions, telephone records from telecommunication companies, as well as trading records from the Singapore Exchange which spanned three years of trading activity from January 2014 to December 2016.

>     Conservatively, the interviewing of relevant individuals, including the accused, consumed a total of about 230 man-hours. Separately, about another 308-man hours were spent on interview preparation and the analysis of documentation.

48     Defence counsel submitted that the lack of cooperation on the accused’s part cannot in itself be an aggravating factor, just as an accused who claims trial and is convicted should not have his sentence enhanced on the basis of claiming trial.

49     The prosecution clarified its position that it did not rely on the accused non-cooperation as an aggravating factor, but submitted that the accused’s non-cooperation meant that he should not be afforded any mitigatory discount which was afforded to the other cases where the offenders had fully cooperated with investigations.

#### The accused’s ill health

50     Defence counsel submitted that the accused suffers from serious medical ailments which qualified as a mitigating factor. The details are as follows:

> a)     He is actually blind in one eye as his right eye was removed when he was 12 years old and has been wearing a prosthetic eye since.

> b)     He suffers from Retinitis Pigmentosa in his left eye, a rare genetic disorder that causes the retina to slowly and progressively degenerate. As a result, he has difficulties seeing at night and he has lost his side/peripheral vision and would gradually lose most of his sight and become blind. He has mobility issues and he is not entirely independent.

> c)     The accused suffers from nasal obstruction sleep apnea.

51     Defence counsel submitted that a custodial sentence would inevitably involve markedly disproportionate impact on the accused by reason of his medical condition which would render a custodial sentence crushing on him. If the accused were to suffer a fall in prison and injure his left eye, he might go completely blind. As such, a sentence of imprisonment would be completely disproportionate to his culpability for his offences under s 197(1)(b) SFA and his physical condition.

52     In _Chew Soo Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span> (“_Chew Soo Chun_”) the High Court held that ill health can be a mitigating factor where the offender faces far greater suffering than the usual hardship in serving a term of imprisonment, for example, because of a risk of significant deterioration in health, or a significant exacerbation of pain and suffering (at \[34\]), and whether it reveals a real likelihood of disproportionate impact on the offender that warrants a sentencing discount (at \[36\]).

53     In this regard, neither of the medical reports dated 3 January 2020 and 20 May 2020 submitted by the defence specifically state that a term of incarceration would endanger the accused’s life or personal safety.

54     In _Chew Soo Chun_ at \[39(a)\] the High Court made clear that the offender’s ill health would be irrelevant when it can be addressed by surgery or treatment, and where the prison has the capability to address the conditions to an acceptable standard, which need not be the best medical standard.

55     The prosecution submitted that the accused may be housed in the prison medical centre with easy access to medical assistance. There would be supervision which would be provided in the form of patrols by officers, or by remote monitoring via close-circuit television cameras.

56     Similarly, while the accused suffers from nasal obstruction and sleep apnea, this appeared to be a longstanding condition unaffected and independent of the accused’s place of abode. His medical report dated 2 June 2020 noted that the nasal obstruction can be treated with surgery, and sleep apnea can be treated with a positive airway pressure machine or surgery.

57     In _Chew Soo Chun_ at \[39(b)\], the High Court held that ill health would be irrelevant if the consequences will transpire whether the offender was in or outside of prison. This was the situation in the present case. The medical report dated 3 January 2020 states that “There is currently no cure for \[Retinitis Pigmentosa\] and there is a risk of retinal detachment and blindness if he has any falls or injury to his left eye.” In other words, the accused suffered from a condition that would afflict him regardless of environment.

58     I accordingly agree with the prosecution’s submission that the accused’s medical condition did not carry any mitigatory weight within the principles enunciated in _Chew Soo Chun_. As noted by the High Court in Chew Soo Chun at \[39\]:

>     In all other cases, ill health is irrelevant to sentencing. It may be that the offender has a condition or several conditions, but unless he can satisfy the tests for exercising judicial mercy or for mitigating a sentence because of disproportionate suffering or decreased culpability, there is no proper basis to vary the sentence. Hence, it will be insufficient for an offender to merely show that he is ill.

### Sentence for the market rigging charges

59     In _Ng Geok Eng_ the High Court held at \[61\], \[64\] and \[77\]:

>      **An offence of false trading is one which strikes at the fundamental integrity of our securities market. Persons found guilty of such offences should be taken to task far more firmly than they have been thus far. The courts should not shy away from imposing custodial sentences for offences of false trading or market rigging.**

>     ………

>     The various excerpts of the parliamentary debates extracted above clearly evidence Parliament’s determination to “**stamp out” any form of market manipulation which destroys a “true market in securities”…**

>     …..

>     Given the serious public interest considerations in favour of deterring market rigging practices, the circumstances in the present case were undoubtedly sufficiently egregious to warrant the imposition of a term of incarceration. **A more lenient approach towards offenders such as the appellant would give potential offenders cause to think that they would be able to commit an offence and “still ‘get away lightly’ by being fined up to only a certain statutory limit”:** see _Rupchand Bhojwani Sunil v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR 596</span> at \[28\].

>     \[emphasis added\]

60     In _Ng Sae Kiat_ the High Court of 3 judges held at \[56\]:

>      **Certain types of market misconduct (eg, market rigging (criminalised in s 197 of the SFA)**, market manipulation (criminalised in s 198 of the SFA), dissemination of false or misleading information (criminalised in s 199 of the SFA), etc) **will adversely affect the integrity of the financial market by causing the information conveyed on the market to be distorted. Such offences will ordinarily warrant a custodial sentence.** For example, in \[PP v Wang Ziyi Able <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 1082</span>\], V K Rajah JA noted that the dissemination of false information with dishonest intent to induce other persons to purchase or sell shares would almost inevitably attract a custodial sentence (at \[29\]). **Additionally, in \[Ng Geok Eng v PP <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 913</span> (“Ng Geok Eng”)\] Tay J opined that market rigging offences should be dealt with harshly and would ordinarily warrant custodial sentences (at \[66\]).**

>     \[emphasis added\]

61     I have earlier discussed the offence and offender specific factors for the s 197(1)(b) SFA offences in the present case.

62     While defence counsel had meticulously compared the facts of the present case with cases where fines were imposed, sentencing is ultimately a fact intensive exercise and no two cases can ever be identical as their levels of harm and culpability and the combination thereof would not be identical. In some cases, the level of harm may be more than the present case but the culpability may be lower or vice versa. Each case would also differ with regard to offender specific factors.

63     In my judgment, neither the harm or culpability of the accused in the present case could be said to be at the lowest end which may justify a departure from a custodial sentence which would ordinarily be the case for market rigging offences as enunciated by the High Court in _Ng Geok Eng_ and _Ng Sae Kiat_. There was market impact and hence harm caused to the market and the accused was not a conduit or a secondary player. He had an overall plan to prop up the Gaylin share price and he executed this on 17 occasions over a period of close to one year. Further, the methods he employed for market rigging was able to materially influence the price of Gaylin shares of between 6.5% to 38.6% which was higher than what they would have been but for his actions.

64     As such, I disagreed with defence counsel that high fines would be a sufficient deterrent in the present case and am of the view that the custodial threshold has been crossed. The issue was then the length of the custodial term. In this regard, I turned to cases where custodial terms were imposed on the offenders cited by defence counsel.

65     In _PP v Chan Lye Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 3</span> the offender was a remisier who was approached by another remisier in a scheme to manipulate the shares of Leong Hin Holdings Ltd. With the consent of a client, he used that client’s account to execute manipulative trades. The offender’s trades accounted for more than 10% of the daily market traded volume and he earned a gross commission from the trades. In sentencing the offender to 3 months’ imprisonment, the learned District Judge noted at \[19\] that offences under s 197(1) SFA were difficult to detect and tremendous resources and effort were required to bring the offenders to book and a deterrent sentence needed to be imposed to deter the accused and other like-minded persons from committing such offences.

66      _PP v Chan Chwee Leong & Chan Peng Kheng_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 249</span> concerned the managing director and executive chairman of Leong Hin Holdings Ltd, both of whom participated in a prolonged scheme to manipulate the share price of the company in order to stave off a fall in the share price of the company and avoid margin calls.

67     For the market rigging offences, the offender Chan Chwee Leong was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and Chan Peng Kheng were sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment as the court noted that Chan Peng Kheng’s role was less active than that of Chan Chwee Leong and further Chan Peng Kheng had offered to bear the prosecution’s costs.

68     In the present case, the prosecution accepted that the accused’s culpability and criminal conduct was objectively less serious than that of the offender Chan Peng Kheng who had been sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment. As such, the prosecution had already taken this sentencing precedent into account by adjusting downward from the sentence meted out to Chan Peng Kheng and submitted for a global sentence of 16 to 20 weeks’ imprisonment in respect of the accused’s lack of cooperation.

69     Defence counsel referred _PP v Lau Wah Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 293</span> where custodial terms of between 3 months to 24 weeks imprisonment were imposed on the secondary co-conspirators Teo Boon Cheang, Rayson Goh and Yeo An Lun, Defence counsel highlighted the culpability and harm of these co-conspirators and their respective sentences as set out in a table at \[22\] of the learned District Judge’s grounds of decision and submitted that they were far more serious than the present case.

70     Defence counsel submitted that in _Lau Wah Heng_ the share price collapsed 84% in a single day as a result of the offenders’ market rigging activities, and submitted that this could well be the second worst case of market rigging in Singapore’s history, whereas the scale of the accused's offence here was nowhere near that to justify a sentence of 16 to 20 weeks’ imprisonment as sought by the prosecution.

71     Defence counsel also referred to the unreported decision of _Vincent Tan_ where Senior District Judge See Kee Oon (as he then was) (“SDJ See”) imposed high fines and submitted that there were “many striking similarities” with the present case.

72     While _Vincent Tan_ was an unreported decision, there was a one and half page brief grounds of decision by SDJ See as to why in his view the custodial threshold had not been crossed. Specifically, he said that the offender’s primary motivation was to bolster the share price, the impact on the market was insignificant as it had moved with the Straits Times Index (“STI”) rising trend, and further he had pleaded guilty and had cooperated with the authorities. That said, I am respectfully of the view that given that _Vincent Tan_ was not a reported case with full grounds, its precedential value would be more limited than a reported decision where full grounds had been rendered, see _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> per Chan Seng Onn J in \[62\].

73     In any event, even having regard to the brief grounds of decision of _Vincent Tan_ I am of the view that there were material differences between _Vincent Tan_ and the present case. In _Vincent Tan_ SDJ See noted that market impact was insignificant as it had moved with the STI rising trend and the accused had cooperated with investigation from their commencement. Further, in _Vincent Tan_ the offender dutifully reported the offending trades (being interested party trades) by way of public announcements on the SGX website. In the present case, the accused had through his actions, increased the price of Gaylin’s shares of between 6.5% to 38.6% and was not cooperative with the authorities.

74     Defence counsel also referred to a media release by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) with regard to one Wong Chow Lin@Benjamin Wong which was a civil penalty enforcement action for false trading of Heng Long International (HLI) shares where Wong paid a civil penalty of $50,000 and MAS also issued a prohibition order against him from carrying on in any regulated activity as a representative and taking part of the management of any holder of a capital market service licence. With respect, as this was not a criminal prosecution but a civil regulatory action by the MAS where no grounds of decision were issued by the MAS, I did not find the MAS media release of Wong’s case to be of much assistance as a precedent.

75     While the prosecution had sought a higher sentence for the proceeded 16th and 17th charges where the accused had caused the highest percentage of increase of Gaylin’s share price, given that in all seven proceeded charges under s 197(1)(b) SFA, the accused had caused a price increase either with regard to the previous day’s closing price or the same day preceding share price, I did not see the need to further calibrate the duration of the custodial term for each charge in line with the level of price increase.

76     In the other cases where custodial sentences were imposed there were additional aggravating factors in those cases which affected the length of the custodial sentences were imposed. For instance, in _Lau Wah Heng_ where higher custodial terms were imposed, the market impact there was greater where SGX issued a trade with caution warning and the relevant share price crashed by more than 84% and the market capitalisation tumbled by more than $58 million. In _Ng Geok Eng_, the offender was responsible for 44.7% of the total buying volume involving 192.5 million Autron shares which placed upward pressure on Autron’s share price on 131 out of 205 days. In sentencing the offender to 6 months’ imprisonment notwithstanding the fact that there was _no proven loss to any market investor_, Tay J observed at \[82\]:

>     His unwavering determination to artificially prop up the price of the Autron shares struck at the very heart of our securities market. The investing public is entitled to rely on market prices as an accurate reflection of genuine demand and supply.

77     That said, unlike the co-conspirators Teo Boon Cheang, Rayson Goh and Yeo An Lun in _Lau Wah Heng_ the accused was not a secondary player and was the sole actor in this present case. As for mitigating factors, while I accorded some mitigatory discount on account of his plea of guilt, the accused’s lack of cooperation with investigations (which included a section 182 PC charge which was taken into consideration) did not accord him any further mitigatory treatment, in contrast to other offenders in previous cases who had cooperated with the authorities. The amount of resources expended by the authorities in this case due to the accused’s lack of cooperation echoed what the learned District Judge said in _Chan Lye Huat_ that that offences under s 197(1) SFA are difficult to detect and tremendous resources and effort are required to bring offenders to book.

78     All things considered, I imposed a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment in the present case for each of the seven proceeded s 197(1)(b) SFA charges.

### Consecutive sentences

79     As for which sentence of imprisonment should be consecutive, in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> Menon CJ observed at \[41\] that

>     As a general rule, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.

80     On what amounts to an “unrelated offence”, Menon CJ observed \[69\] that

>     ...to say that two offences are “unrelated” means that they are not “part of a single transaction”; conversely, to describe them as “part of a single transaction” means they are not “unrelated”. The two inquiries are two sides of the same coin.

81     In _Mohamad Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“Mohamad Shouffee”) Menon CJ held at \[27\] that in deciding which sentences should run consecutively, the sentencing court should apply the one transaction rule and the totality principle. Menon CJ approved the observations of V K Rajah J (as he then was) in _PP v Law Aik Meng_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 814 where Rajah J held that at \[52\] that the concept of single transaction referred to sequence of offences involving a repetition of the same behaviour towards the same victim provided the offences are committed within a relatively short space in time.

82     Under section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code there is an obligation to impose consecutive sentences where there are three or more distinct offences for which the accused has been sentenced to imprisonment (as in the present case), at least two sentences of imprisonment are to be consecutive. Menon CJ explained the operation of s 307(1) CPC and consecutive sentences in _Raveen Balakrishnan_ \[at para 52\] as follows:

>     The general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences does not contravene s 307(1) or render it otiose. The provision retains its relevance in that it operates regardless of whether the multiple offences are related or otherwise. Therefore, even if all or some of the offences are related, s 307(1) applies to require that at least two sentences should run consecutively. Indeed, in my judgment, s 307(1) of the CPC, the one transaction rule, and the general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences should be regarded as complementary principles that collectively help a court decide how sentences should be ordered to run in relation to a multiple offender.

83     As for the totality principle, Menon CJ held in _Mohamad Shouffee_ at \[47\] that “this is a principle of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions.” Menon CJ explained at \[54\] that the first limb of the totality principle examines whether “the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed and at \[57\] the second limb which considers whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects.

84     As the proceeded charges for which a custodial term had been imposed all pertain to s 197(1)(b) SFA offences and are related in that they related to market rigging of Gaylin shares committed between 15 February 2016 and 10 October 2016, I was of the view that it would suffice to have two sentences run consecutively as minimally required pursuant to s 307(1) CPC. In the circumstances, I ordered the sentences for the 3rd (DAC 903629 of 2020) and 17th charge (DAC 903643 of 2020) to run consecutively, making a total of 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

85     In totality, I am of the view that a global sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment is appropriate in the circumstances and does not offend the totality principle nor was it a crushing sentence given that an offender may be sentenced up to 7 years’ imprisonment for a s 197(1)(b) SFA offence.

### Sentence for the s 201(b) SFA charge

86     Although the accused did not appeal against the sentence imposed for the s 201(b) SFA charge, for completeness I state my reasons for arriving at the sentence.

87     The gravamen of the s 201(b) SFA charge is that from 10 May 2012 to 5 May 2015, the accused failed to disclose his beneficial interest of 50% of Gaylin Shares in Lim Teck Chuan’s (“Lim”) trading account to UOBKH in connection with the purchase and sale of Gaylin Shares. During this period, the accused used Lim’s trading account to purchase and sell Gaylin Shares and had accumulated a total of 14,848,800 Gaylin Shares using Lim’s account by 5 May 2015.

88     Both the prosecution and defence were in agreement that a fine was appropriate in the circumstances as the accused had the consent of the account holder Lim to share in the beneficial interest in the shares as well as execute the relevant trades.

89     The prosecution referred to _PP v Soligny Bruno Ludovic_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 20</span> (“Soligny Bruno”), where the offender had utilised his wife’s trading account (with her consent) to manipulate the share price of China Fibretech Ltd (“CFT”). After pleading guilty to one charge under s 201(b) SFA and consenting for two s 201(b) SFA charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, the offender was sentenced to a fine of $50,000 (in default 3 months’ imprisonment). $50,000 was also the fine imposed by the High Court in _Ng Geok Eng_ for the 201(b) SFA charges where the trading took place with the account holder’s consent but had been used for the purposes of market rigging.

90     As Lim’s account in the present case was not used for market rigging unlike Soligny Bruno and Ng Geok Eng, I was of the view that a fine of $30,000 (in default 2 month’s imprisonment) was an appropriate fine in the circumstances.

## Conclusion

91     In conclusion, the sentences I imposed were as follows:
