\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9332/2019/01 .\]

20 February 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Toh Yung Cheong:

1       The accused claimed trial to 14 charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The charges relate to two sets of drugs recovered from 2 different locations by Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers on 6 October 2017:

> 1.1.     The first set of drugs was recovered from a public pavement outside Dover MRT station (“the Dover MRT drugs”). This comprised 6.83g of diamorphine and 118.59g of methamphetamine. The accused was charged with possession for the purpose of trafficking.

> 1.2.     The second set of drugs was recovered from the accused’s apartment at City Loft Condominium (“the City Loft drugs”). This comprised 164.53g of methamphetamine and a number of other drugs. The accused was charged with possessing the 164.53g of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking and with possession of the other drugs.

2       The prosecution’s case is that the accused collected the Dover MRT drugs from one Taamotharan Vasudevan (PW1; “Taamo”) at Jelita Shopping Centre. He was trailed by CNB officers as he departed Jelita Shopping Centre in his car. According to a CNB officer, when the accused reached Clementi Road, he started driving “recklessly and dangerously” and the trailing officers lost sight of him temporarily along Commonwealth Avenue. CNB officers reacquired contact after Dover MRT station and tried to keep up with him all the way to Ghim Moh Link. At Ghim Moh Link, one CNB officer saw the accused abandon his car and run off. The accused was later arrested at a Sheng Shiong supermarket in the vicinity but no drugs were found on him. However, drugs were discovered scattered across a public pavement outside Dover MRT. The prosecution’s case is that the accused threw the drugs out of his car.

3       On the same day, CNB officers arrested the accused’s girlfriend at the ground floor lift lobby of City Loft Condominium (“City Loft”). She was brought to the unit that she was staying in with the accused. Drugs were recovered from the bedroom as well as the false ceiling of the toilet. The drugs found in the toilet, namely 164.53g of methamphetamine, form the subject matter of a possession for the purpose of trafficking charge. The drugs found in the bedroom form the subject matter of the remaining possession charges. Subsequently, the accused was brought to City Loft and shown the drugs. He then admitted to a CNB officer that the drugs belonged to him and claimed that they were for his personal consumption.

4       At the conclusion of the trial, I convicted the accused of the 14 charges that were the subject matter of the trial. After the trial, the accused also pleaded guilty to one stood down charge involving consumption of a specified drug. As the accused has appealed against his sentence and conviction, I will now set out the reasons for my decision.

5       I will deal with the drugs recovered in the vicinity of Dover MRT (“the Dover MRT drugs”) in Part I of this judgment and the drugs recovered from City Loft Apartment in Part II of this judgment.

## Issues

6       In relation to the Dover MRT drugs, the issues are:

> 6.1.     Issue 1: Whether PW1 Taamotharan handed the drugs to the accused at Jelita Shopping Centre

> 6.2.     Issue 2: Whether the drugs found on the public pavement outside Dover MRT were thrown there by the accused.

> 6.3.     Issue 3: Whether the accused had knowledge of the nature of the drugs

> 6.4.     Issue 4: Whether the presumption of trafficking under s.17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act has been triggered.

## Issue 1 and 2: _Actus Reus /_ Conduct Element

7       In this section I deal with issues 1 and 2, which relate to the _actus reus_ or conduct element of the offence. I found that PW1 Taamotharan handed a black plastic bag (Exhibit C1) containing drugs to the accused and in return the accused gave him a bundle (exhibit TV-A1) of money. This took place at the loading / unloading bay of Jelita on 6 October 2017. Next I found that the accused, after he left Jelita, started driving in a reckless manner after Clementi Road and along Commonwealth Avenue. Around the Dover MRT area, he threw the bag of drugs out of the car and the bag of drugs landed on the public pavement.

8       In arriving at this finding, I took into account the following evidence

> 8.1.     Evidence of PW1 Taamotharan Vasudevan (“Taamo”)

> 8.2.     Evidence of the 4 CNB officers who observed the interaction between Taamo and the accused at the Jelita loading / unloading bay, together with the video recording made by one of the officers.

> 8.3.     Evidence that the accused’s DNA was found on the bundle of money (Exhibit TV-A1 and TV-BAND)

> 8.4.     Evidence relating to the accused’s conduct after leaving Jelita and his arrest.

> 8.5.     The accused’s defence.

### Evidence of PW1 Taamo

9       Taamo was an employee at the Jelita branch of Cold Storage Supermarket. He lived in Malaysia and commuted to Singapore. One day prior to his arrest, he received a red plastic bag containing two to three packets of drugs.[^1] Taamo was instructed to bring the drugs to Jelita where there would be an exchange of the drugs for cash with one of “John’s” men. Prior to bringing the drugs into Singapore, Taamo put the drugs into a black plastic bag which he later identified as exhibit **C1** (Photo 14**).**[^2]

10     On 6 October 2017 at about 7am, Taamo arrived at Jelita with the drugs. He started work at the seafood section and at some point, an unknown male person arrived at the seafood section and nodded his head. Taamo took this as an indication that he needed to go to the back of the building to effect the exchange. He explained that he thought he had to go to the back because that was where a previous exchange of drugs had taken place.[^3]

11     After Taamo proceeded to the back of the building, he smoked a cigarette and looked around. As he wanted to purchase a cup of coffee from a machine, he approached a “Malay guy” who was “wearing a black top” to ask him whether he had coins to change for his currency note. The “Malay guy” gave Taamo some coins but did not take his note. Taamo stated that this “Malay guy” was not the same person who nodded at him in the seafood section earlier. Taamo also testified that the first 51 seconds of the surveillance video (Exhibit P2) pertained to his contact with the “Malay guy.”

12     Thereafter, Taamo felt “quite stressed” regarding the drugs so he went back down and looked around. He saw a car and walked towards it. The side window was wound down and the “gentleman” inside the car said “barang”. Taamo took out the drugs and passed it to him and this person gave him a bundle and told him “duit” (which means money in the Malay language). Taamo confirmed that the money received was TV-A1 and that he did not open TV-A1 as he knew he was not supposed to do so.

13     When asked whether he could recognise the accused, Taamo testified he could not. He stated that “John” had told him not to speak to anyone or even look at the person’s face. Taamo was feeling “very stressed” and just wanted to hand over the drugs.[^4]

14     Taamo confirmed the transaction described above was shown in the surveillance video from 0:51 to 2:02 (minutes/seconds) of the recording.[^5] Taamo was also arrested and charged with drug importation.[^6]

##### FINDINGS

15     Taamo was unable to identify the accused as the person he passed the drugs to. However, this in itself was not fatal to the prosecution’s case as there was other evidence which shows that the accused was the person in the Jelita loading/unloading bay that morning. What is significant is that Taamo testified that the surveillance video P2 was an accurate account of events that morning.

16     Taamo’s evidence was important as it provides the starting point for the chain of possession of the drugs that were eventually discovered in the vicinity of Dover MRT. His evidence showed how the drugs entered Singapore from Malaysia and how they were handed to someone in the Jelita loading/ unloading bay.

17     Taamo’s evidence that he did not open the bundle of money he received was also significant as it makes it less likely that Taamo somehow “transferred” the accused’s DNA onto exhibits TV-A1 and TV-BAND. The DNA evidence will be dealt with in more detail later.

### Evidence of the CNB officers at Jelita and the surveillance video

18     As part of an operation the CNB mounted that morning, a number of CNB officers were conducting surveillance of Jelita Shopping Centre from a neighbouring apartment block. As the evidence of the 4 CNB officers (PW4 SSgt Mohammad Nabil, PW10 SI Mohamed Affendi, PW13 SSgt Tan Zhang Sheng, and PW12 SI Mohamed Fadil) and the surveillance video (exhibit P2) were largely consistent, I will summarise the key points:

> 18.1.     A dark-coloured Mazda drove into the loading/unloading bay and parked. The accused[^7] exited the car and walked into Jelita.

> 18.2.     The accused returned carrying a white plastic bag. A male Indian approached the accused and they walked towards the car. The accused entered the car and sat on the driver’s seat with the door half-opened. The male Indian stood outside.

> 18.3.     The male Indian walked away. The accused drove the Mazda out from the lot and stopped parallel to the wall of the shopping centre. The male Indian approached the car again from the driver’s side. SI Mohamed noticed the male Indian adjust his apron and bend down at the driver’s side. Similarly, SSgt Tan noticed the male Indian approaching the car with his hand underneath his apron; when he reached the driver’s side car window, the male Indian bent down.

> 18.4.     Thereafter, the accused drove his car out of the Jelita loading/unloading bay.

> 18.5.     There was no evidence that there was anyone else other than Taamo and the accused in the loading/unloading bay when the transaction took place.

##### FINDINGS

19     I find that the evidence of the CNB officers was reliable and they had testified honestly and to the best of their recollection. The surveillance video also shows that they had an unobstructed view and that visibility was good. Two CNB officers were able to identify the accused while the other 2 could not. If the CNB officers had wanted to frame the accused, all 4 of them could have tailored their evidence and claimed that they recognised the accused. In addition, their oral evidence was corroborated by the surveillance video P2.

### DNA Evidence: Dover MRT Drugs

20     In considering the relevance and weight to be attached to the DNA evidence, I bore in mind the approach taken in previous cases of drug trafficking where DNA evidence was introduced: _Gopu Jaya Raman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 499</span> and _Mui Jia Jun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 1087</span>.

21     In _Mui Jia Jun_ at \[62\], Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon stated:

> Unlike the absence of DNA evidence, which is neither conclusive nor even necessarily probative, the presence of DNA is generally probative because it tends to establish that the subject did in fact come into contact with the surface or point where his DNA was found.

22     DNA testing was done on the packaging of the Dover MRT drugs as well as the packaging of the money received by Taamo. The following exhibits had interpretable DNA:

##### FINDINGS

23     The presence of Taamo’s DNA on the plastic bag C1 is probative because it establishes the fact that Taamo had come into contact with C1 and corroborates his account that he put the drugs in a black plastic bag[^8]. This evidence supports the prosecution’s case that the drugs found in the vicinity of Dover MRT were the same drugs that Taamo had handed to someone at Jelita.

24     Similarly, the presence of the accused’s DNA on TV-A1 and TV-Band is probative because it establishes the fact that the accused had come into contact with TV-A1, which was the bundle of cash that Taamo received in return for the drugs. This supports the prosecution’s case that the accused was the person who handed the bundle of money to Taamo.

25     The defence advanced the argument that the accused’s DNA was ‘transferred’ onto TV-A1 and TV-Band by Taamo. According to the defence, the accused gave Taamo 40 cents and a cigarette. The accused claimed that he had made physical contact with Taamo during these transactions. As a result, the accused’s DNA was somehow transferred onto Taamo and then transferred onto TV-A1 and TV-Band. I found that this argument did not raise a reasonable doubt:

> 25.1.     There was no evidence that Taamo touched TV-A1 or TV-Band after the accused purportedly gave him 40 cents or a cigarette.

> 25.2.     Taamo’s evidence was that he did not open TV-A1 after he received it. Therefore, he could not have possibly touched TV-Band.

> 25.3.     Taamo’s DNA was not found on TV-A1 and TV-Band. The defence did not produce any evidence how it was possible for Taamo to transfer the accused’s DNA to TV-A1 and TV-Band without also transferring his own DNA.

### Evidence relating to the accused’s arrest

26     After the accused drove out of the Jelita loading/ unloading bay in his Mazda, he was tailed by CNB officers. The collective evidence of these CNB officers shows that when he reached Clementi Road, the accused was “spooked” by something and tried to get away:

> 26.1.      **PW7 Inspector Kua Boon San** observed the accused driving “recklessly and dangerously” as he was “driving in and out of traffic” and “\[cutting\] into other people’s lane abruptly.”[^9] Insp Kua lost sight of the accused along Commonwealth Avenue and only regained sight of him after Dover MRT station. Upon arriving at Ghim Moh Link, Insp Kua observed that the black Mazda was not parked in a proper lot and appeared to have been “just chucked there” and was “obstructing the traffic.”[^10]

> 26.2.      **PW3 SI Jason Tay** observed the accused to be driving “quite fast” at about 30-50km/h above the speed limit. Upon arriving at Ghim Moh Link, SI observed that the door to the black Mazda was open with nobody inside.[^11]

> 26.3.      **PW11 Sgt Yogaraj** observed the accused’s car picking up speed at Clementi Road, and that it was making “abrupt turns.” Sgt Yogaraj lost sight of the accused along Commonwealth Avenue, and only regained sight of him after Dover MRT station. Upon arriving at Ghim Moh Link, Sgt Yogaraj observed that the black Mazda appeared to have been “just left there” as the vehicle was “blocking both sides of the lane.”[^12]

> 26.4.      **PW17 Sgt Muhammad Nasrulhaq** was on a motorcycle driven by another CNB officer. Upon his arrival at Ghim Moh Link, he observed the driver of the Black Mazda exit the vehicle and run off. Sgt Muhammad Nasrulhaq gave chase but did not immediately apprehend him, though he was involved in the accused’s eventual arrest.

27     The accused was eventually arrested in a Sheng Shiong supermarket along Ghim Moh Link. CCTV footage retrieved from the supermarket (Exhibit P5) showed the accused hiding something (which turned out to be two of his mobile phones) among vegetables in two separate locations inside the supermarket.

### Accused’s defence

28     The accused testified that he went to Jelita Shopping Centre on 6 October 2017 to buy a watermelon and a watch battery. However, he ended up buying some cut fruit as a whole watermelon was not available. When the accused returned to his car, a male Indian approached him and asked for 40 cents[^13] in order to buy a drink. The accused did not have 40 cents in his pocket so he went back to his car to get some coins. Thereafter, the accused passed the person the coins by placing the coins onto his hands. The accused claimed that the surveillance video showed him giving coins to the male Indian while his car was parked in the lot at the Jelita loading/unloading bay.

29     Subsequently, the accused moved his car out of the lot but stopped the car along the loading/unloading bay because he wanted to make a call and have a smoke at the same time.[^14] The same male Indian approached the car and asked the accused for a cigarette and the accused obliged.[^15]

30     The accused in his evidence also testified that after he left Jelita, “on the way I wanted to pee. So, I looked for a toilet.”[^16] However, the accused claimed that there was no urgency and he denied driving fast before that.[^17] The accused claimed that he did not abandon the car but “parked” it, though he admit that he did not park the car in a proper parking lot.[^18] In addition, when he saw a Sheng Shiong supermarket at Ghim Moh Link, he decided to enter the supermarket to “buy fruits again” instead of going to the toilet.[^19]

31     After the accused entered Sheng Shiong supermarket, he saw a “suspicious person” looking at him and thought he was going to be arrested because he did not go for his urine test. Since the accused had 2 stolen handphones, he decided to hide the phones.[^20]

### Evidence of defence witness DW3 Mohamad Azhar Bin Nasir

32     DW3 Mohamad Azhar testified after PW21 Zulhelmy was arrested and released on bail, Zulhelmy called him and told him how he was “lucky” because he managed to throw keys and 500 grams of Marijuana out of a car window before being arrested on 6 October.[^21]

33     I found that this aspect of his evidence had nothing to do with the prosecution’s present case that the accused threw a bag containing Methamphetamine out of his car in the vicinity of Dover MRT.

### Evaluation of Defence

##### DENIAL THAT HE RECEIVED DRUGS FROM TAAMO

34     While there is no rule that a bare denial cannot be accepted, the accused’s denial that he received drugs from Taamo has to be weighed against all the other evidence. In the present case, I did not accept the accused’s denial and find that there was overwhelming evidence that Taamo had handed over the drugs in exchange for a bundle of money at the Jelita loading/unloading bay.

##### EXPLANATION FOR HIS POST-INCIDENT BEHAVIOUR

35     I found the accused’s explanation for his post-incident behaviour to be lacking in credibility:

> 35.1.     I preferred the evidence of the four CNB officers that the accused was driving fast and in a dangerous manner. If he was driving in a normal manner, the CNB officers who were following in cars and a motorcycle would not have had any difficulty tailing him.

> 35.2.     Similarly, PW17 Sgt Muhammad arrived at Ghim Moh link just as the accused exited and ran off. Sgt Muhammad gave chase but lost him. If the accused was not in a hurry, Sgt Muhammad would have had no difficulties catching up with him[^22].

> 35.3.     The accused’s lawyer put to PW7 Inspector Kua that the accused drove in a manner that “appeared” to be dangerous because “he had a bad stomach and he was looking for a toilet.”[^23] This suggested that initially, the defence accepted that the accused was driving fast but sought to provide an explanation.

> 35.4.     However, this contradicted the accused’s subsequent testimony that he only wanted to urinate and that it was not urgent. As the trial progressed, the accused must have realised his earlier instructions to his lawyer that he urgently needed to use the toilet was simply not believable as the first thing he did on stopping the car was to rush to a supermarket vegetable section to hide his handphones.

### Decision on Issues 1 and 2

36     I found that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused received the drugs from Taamo at the Jelita loading/unloading bay and that he subsequently threw the drugs out of his car when he was in the vicinity of Dover MRT station.

37     Even though Taamo could not identify the accused, I noted that the defence did not dispute that the accused was the person in the surveillance video. The accused admitted that a transaction had taken place but claimed that it had nothing to do with drugs. According to the accused, he merely gave Taamo some spare change and a cigarette.

38     The presence of the accused’s DNA on the bundle of money (specifically TV-A1 and TV-Band) shows that the accused had come into contact with the money and this also supports the prosecution’s case that the accused had handed the money to Taamo.

39     Next, I turn to the issue of whether the drugs found on the public pavement outside Dover MRT can be linked to the accused. Even though there was no eyewitness or direct evidence which showed how the drugs ended up there, the Court may make an appropriate inference from the evidence. This was the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in _Tan Han Tiong and another v PP_ \[1994\] 2 SLR(R)582. _Tan Han Tiong_ involved an offender who was being pursued by police officers but managed to throw a bag of drugs into a stationary blue pick-up truck without being seen.

40     After driving out of Jelita, the CNB officers were able to tail the accused along Holland Road and Ulu Pandan Road without any issue. According to PW11 Sgt Yogaraj, the accused only started to drive recklessly at Clementi Road. As a result, the CNB officers lost sight of the accused along Commonwealth Avenue and only regained contact with the accused further along Commonwealth Avenue but after Dover MRT. This explains why no CNB officers saw the accused throw the drugs out of the car around Dover MRT.

41     I found that the accused’s post-event conduct was of probative value in this case and raised a strong inference as to his guilt and provided a motive for throwing the drugs out of his car. His post-event conduct was inconsistent with that of an innocent person and this was relevant under s.8(2) of the Evidence Act: _see Lewis Christine v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 131</span> at \[28\]-\[29\].

42     The irresistible inference from the evidence adduced is that the accused starting driving recklessly and subsequently threw the black plastic bag containing drugs out of his car as he believed that he was being tailed or pursued by the authorities.

## Issue 3: Accused’s knowledge of the drugs

43     Taamo’s evidence was unequivocal, his job was to bring drugs in from Malaysia and to hand them to one of “John’s” men at Jelita in exchange for cash. However, the Court still had to decide the issue of whether the accused knew of the nature of the drugs. I took the following into account in arriving at my finding that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite knowledge:

> 43.1.     The accused handed a large bundle of cash amounting to $10,000 to Taamo. Taamo testified that the person who handed him the cash said “duit” meaning cash. This meant that the accused knew full well he was handing a bundle of cash to Taamo and not just a few loose notes. The thickness of the bundle TV-A1 can be seen in photos 94-95. The natural inference would be that he was receiving something of equivalent value in exchange.

> 43.2.     The accused would have been able to recognise that the black bag contained illicit drugs had he looked inside. Since he had just handed over $10,000 in exchange for the black plastic bag, it would stand to reason that he would have inspected the contents to make sure he had gotten what he had paid for.

> 43.3.     The accused’s post-incident behavior of driving recklessly and subsequently throwing the drugs out of his car windows leads to the irresistible inference that he knew that the black plastic bag he received from Taamo contained illegal drugs.

> 43.4.     Despite evidence to the contrary, the accused continued to deny that he gave Taamo money in exchange for drugs. In maintaining this stance, the accused lost the opportunity to explain (in order to raise a reasonable doubt) why he was giving $10,000 to a total stranger and what he thought he was receiving in return for the money.

44     The prosecution also referred to some messages found in the accused’s mobile phones which pertained to drug transactions. However, I did not find it necessary to rely on them.

## Issue 4: Whether s.17 Presumption triggered

45     Under section 17(h) of the Misuse of Drug Act, any person proved to have in his possession more than 25g of methamphetamine shall be presumed to have that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose.

46     In order to rely on s.17 presumption, the prosecution must prove possession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs: _Ramesh a/l Perumal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 1003</span> at \[58\].

47     Given my finding that the prosecution had proven possession and knowledge of the drugs, this meant that the accused is presumed under s.17 to have the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. The accused did not adduce any evidence to rebut this presumption.

## VERDICT: Dover MRT charges

48     I find that:

> 48.1.     The accused met Taamo at the loading /unloading bay of Jelita Shopping Centre

> 48.2.     Taamo handed to the accused a bundle of drugs in a black plastic bag and that the accused had given him a bundle of cash in return.

> 48.3.     The accused knew that the black bag contained illicit drugs, namely methamphetamine and diamorphine.

> 48.4.     The accused has not rebutted the presumption under s.17 MDA that he had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.

49     Therefore, I found the accused guilty of having the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking and convicted him of the charges DAC 906174/18 and 906175/18.

## Issues

The issues in relation to the City Loft drugs are:

> 50.1.     Issue 1: Whether the accused was in possession of the drugs (the _actus reus_ or conduct element)

> 50.2.     Issue 2: Whether the accused had knowledge of the nature of the drugs (the _mens rea_)

> 50.3.     Issue 3: Whether the presumption in s.17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act has been triggered.

## Issues 1 and 2: _Actus reus and mens rea_

51     For the City Loft drugs, I deal with the issue of _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ together as the prosecution relied on the accused’s statement to prove both elements. I took the following into account in evaluating Issue 1 and 2:

> 51.1.     Evidence relating to the persons who had access to the City Loft apartment.

> 51.2.     The accused’s statement to the CNB admitting that the drugs belonged to him and were for his personal consumption.

> 51.3.     The DNA evidence.

> 51.4.     The defence case comprising:

>> 51.4.1.       The accused’s testimony.

>> 51.4.2.       The testimony of the defence witnesses

### Evidence relating to the persons who had access to the City Loft apartment.

52     The accused testified that he lived in the City Loft apartment with Juliana. They had only moved in for about 10 days. They rented the unit and the accused paid the rent.[^24] The accused confirmed that he had a key to the apartment. His defence, which will be dealt with later, was that “Boy” and Zulhelmy (PW21) also had access to the apartment and that Zulhelmy had hidden the drugs in the false ceiling in the toilet.

### The accused’s statement

53     SSgt Mhd Nasrulhaq (PW17) recorded a statement from the accused at City Loft. As the accused challenged the voluntariness of the statement, an ancillary hearing was conducted and I found that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made voluntarily.

54     SSgt Mhd Nasrulhaq testified that he did not offer any threat, inducement or promise to the accused during the recording of the statement.

55     On the other hand, the accused claimed that the statement was not made voluntarily. He claimed that SSgt Nasrulhaq told the accused that if he did not admit, Juliana would be charged and “If you admit, I will release Juliana.”[^25] In light of these words, the accused decided to “admit” in order to “protect Juliana.”[^26] The accused confirmed that this was the _only_ reason why he admitted that the drugs were his.[^27] The accused did not mention in his evidence-in-chief that other CNB officers threatened him prior to SSgt Nasrulhaq recording his statement.

56     During cross-examination, the prosecution questioned the accused on a subsequent statement that he gave to the CNB on 16 October 2017 at 7.25pm (Exhibit P18). The defence did not object to the voluntariness of this statement. In P18 at paragraph 41, the accused stated that:

> 56.1.     Some officers from the 2nd storey of the unit shouted down to him and asked “The drugs inside this house belongs to who?”

> 56.2.     The accused replied “I do not know.”

> 56.3.     The officers shouted back, “If these drugs don’t belong to you, is it belongs to Juliana (_sic_)?”

57     When questioned on this apparent inconsistency with his Court testimony, the accused claimed that both incidents occurred. First, the officers from upstairs did shout at him. Secondly, he was brought to the bedroom where SSgt Nasrulhaq threatened him with Juliana’s arrest.

##### DECISION ON ANCILIARY HEARING

58     I found that SSgt Nasrulhaq was a credible and reliable witness and I accepted his account of how the statement was recorded. I accepted the prosecution’s submission that the accused’s evidence was inconsistent and his allegation against SSgt Nasrulhaq was an afterthought.

> 58.1.     In his statement P18, the accused described how some officers from the upstairs bedroom shouted “If these drugs don’t belong to you, is it belongs to Juliana? (_sic_)” However, he did not mention being threatened by SSgt Nasrulhaq.

> 58.2.     Even if the account in the second statement P18 was true, it would amount to a self-induced fear as the accused admitted that the police officers did not specifically threaten to charge Juliana. Instead, the accused felt that if he did not admit, they would charge Juliana.[^28]

59     The accused, may well have realised that what he had told the CNB earlier in P18 was not actually a threat, inducement or promise and at best a self-induced fear. This may have led him to fabricate a fresh allegation against SSgt Nasrulhaq.

##### WEIGHT TO BE ATTACHED TO THE ACCUSED’S STATEMENT

60     After finding that the statement P17 was made voluntarily, I found that the statement could be relied on to prove that the drugs belonged to the accused. In deciding on the weight to be attached to the statement, I also took into account evidence from the accused in the main trial.

61     To recap, the CNB arrested the accused at Ghim Moh Link and on the same morning, they arrested Juliana at City Loft. The City Loft apartment was searched and the City Loft drugs were retrieved in the presence of Juliana. The accused was only brought to City Loft later.

62     The accused was brought to the bedroom of the City Loft apartment and his statement was recorded by SSgt Nasrulhaq. During the recording of the statement, the accused was shown the drug exhibits that were recovered. At that point, the drug exhibits had already been sealed inside a polymer bag.[^29] SSgt Nasrulhaq would point out the various drug exhibits and recorded the accused’s answers in Question and Answer 16, 17, and 18.[^30] It was not disputed that SSgt Nasrulhaq did not tell the accused where the drugs were found. When the accused gave evidence after his defence was called, he claimed that he was not able to recognise which drugs were his and which drugs were not his as they were mixed. In other words, the defence was claiming that the accused was only confessing in the statement to ownership of the bedroom drugs.[^31]

63     I found that the accused’s statement could be relied on to prove that the drugs found in both the bedroom and toilet belonged to him and that he was aware that they were illicit drugs:

> 63.1.     While the accused was not told where the drugs were found, he was shown the drugs as they were being referred to during the recording of the statement. The accused conceded that the drugs were shown to him.[^32]

> 63.2.     The methamphetamine recovered from the toilet consisted of full and weighty packets containing not less than 164.53g of methamphetamine. In contrast, only 3.02g of methamphetamine was found in the bedroom (DAC 924284/18)This meant that the drugs found in the bedroom were easily distinguishable from the drugs found in the toilet due to the far larger quantity.

> 63.3.     The methamphetamine found in the bedroom came in a blue pouch and a black pouch (photos 75 and 68 of P1 respectively) and these pouches were shown to the accused during the recording of the statement. On the other hand, the drugs in the toilet did not come in coloured pouches. This was another reason why the bedroom drugs and toilet drugs were distinguishable.

> 63.4.     The defence did not cross-examine or challenge SSgt Nasrulhaq’s evidence concerning how the drugs were shown to the accused.[^33]

> 63.5.     During the ancillary hearing, the accused confirmed during cross-examination that he admitted to ownership of the drugs because he wanted to protect Juliana, not because he was confused. In fact, the accused admitted that he was already aware when he gave the statement that some of the drugs did not belong to him[^34]

> 63.6.     During the main trial, the accused went further and confirmed that he was aware which drugs belonged to him and which did not. Even though he was not told specifically that the large bundles of methamphetamine were recovered from the toilet, he claimed he was able to tell the CNB officer that they did not belong to him.[^35]

> 63.7.     This suggests that the accused’s fresh claim in the main trial that he thought he was only confessing to the bedroom drugs was an afterthought that he only raised after his initial claim that he gave the statement to protect Juliana was rejected.

### DNA Evidence

64     A DNA analysis (Exhibit P22) of the City Loft drug exhibits revealed the following:

> 64.1.     The accused’s DNA was found on the exterior of H1E8 (Clear plastic bag Exhibit P1 Photo 83) and on the adhesive side of the tape on H1E8. This exhibit pertains to one of the bags of methamphetamine found in the false ceiling of the toilet.

> 64.2.     Zulhelmy’s DNA was also found on a number of exhibits pertaining to the drugs found in the toilet:

>> 64.2.1.       The exterior of H1E8 (_supra_).

>> 64.2.2.       H1E5 (Clear plastic bag: Photo 83)

>> 64.2.3.       H1E6A (sachets containing a white substance: Photo 83)

>> 64.2.4.       H1E7 (Clear plastic bag: Photo 83)

##### FINDINGS

65     As I have highlighted earlier, the DNA evidence is probative because it tends to establish that the subject did in fact come into contact with the surface or point where his DNA was found: _Mui Jia Jun_ at \[62\].

66     The fact that the accused’s DNA was found on the adhesive side of the tape on the plastic bag H1E8 was significant because it suggested that the accused came into contact with the adhesive tape around the time the tape was being applied to the plastic bag. If the accused had come into contact _before the tape_ was applied (i.e. there was no tape on the bag), or _after_ the tape had already been applied, it was highly unlikely that his DNA could have been transferred to the adhesive side.

67     On the other hand, while the DNA evidence shows that Zulhelmy also came into contact with the toilet drugs, this did not exonerate the accused. It was still possible that the drugs were in the accused’s possession even if Zulhelmy had previously come into contact with it.

### Defence in respect of the City Loft drugs

68     The accused testified that he had stayed at the City Loft apartment for about 10 days. Prior to that, he stayed in a flat at Yishun. His friend called “Boy” helped Juliana and him move from Yishun to City Loft. PW21 Zulhelmy did not help them to move but would come over to visit. According to the accused, Zulhelmy would remain in the apartment to watch TV even if the accused was not in the apartment.[^36]

69     The accused admitted to having a key to the apartment and claimed that Juliana, “Boy”, “Zulhelmy” and himself had access to the front gate of the Condominium. As for the actual apartment door, there were only two keys, one with the accused and the other with either “Boy” or Zulhelmy but he believed it was more likely to be Zulhelmy [^37] Juliana did not have her own key but would share the accused’s key.

70     In respect of the drugs found, the accused admitted that some of the drugs found in the bedroom belonged to him. However, he was not aware of the drugs found in the toilet.

##### DEFENCE THAT ZULHELMY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DRUGS

71     The defence used the presence of Zulhemy’s DNA on the drug exhibits to put forward a very specific assertion that Zulhelmy had packed the toilet drugs and hid the drugs in the false ceiling (presumably without the accused’s knowledge).[^38] Apart from this, the defence also mentioned that there was a person called “Boy” who also had access to the apartment though they did not specifically claim that the drugs belonged to “Boy.” In light of this allegation, the prosecution called PW21 Zulhelmy bin Mohamed Toha as a witness so that he could be questioned by the defence.

72     Subsequently, the defence also called DW2 Juliana Binte Gum Ati and DW4 Girda Bin Bani to testify:

> 72.1.     DW2 Juliana testified that she had only stayed in the apartment for less than a week.”[^39] “Boy” and Zulhelmy visited the apartment regularly though she was unable to recall whether they had the key and whether they could enter the apartment on their own accord (i.e. without either the accused or Juliana opening the door for them).[^40] However, Juliana also claimed that she had never opened the door for them. [^41]Juliana also confirmed that she had never seen the drugs before.

> 72.2.     DW4 Girda Bin Bani testified that on one occasion, Zulhelmy had told him that he wanted to ‘clear something’ at the City Loft apartment.[^42] However, such a vague assertion was neither here nor there and did not assist the defence case.

##### ASSESSMENT OF DEFENCE

73     I accepted that Zulhelmy visited the City Loft apartment and that his DNA was found on some of the City Loft drug exhibits. This would suggest that Zulhelmy had come in contact with the drugs exhibits where his DNA was found.

74     However, this in itself did not mean that the accused had nothing to do with the drugs especially since the accused’s DNA was found on one of the drug exhibits recovered from the toilet and furthermore had given a statement admitting that those drugs belonged to him. In contrast, Zulhelmy denied involvement with the City Loft drugs and the defence could not provide any further evidence of Zulhelmy’s contact with or knowledge of those drugs.

75     Therefore, I found that the presence of Zulhelmy’s DNA on some of the drug exhibits did not raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case that the drugs were in the accused’s possession.

## Presumption under s.17

76     One of the City Loft charges was a charge of having 13 packets containing not less than 164.53g of methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.

77     As the accused had possession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs retrieved from City Loft, he is presumed under s.17 MDA to be in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.

78     The accused has not offered any evidence to rebut this presumption. While the accused claimed in P17 that the drugs were for his own consumption, he did not put forward this claim during the trial but instead maintained that the drugs were not his. As the accused did not adduce any evidence to show that these drugs were for his personal consumption or for other purposes unrelated to trafficking, I find that the accused has failed to discharge his burden of proof and has failed to rebut the presumption under s.17 MDA on a balance of probabilities.

## Verdict in relation to the City Loft Drugs

79     After considering all the evidence, I found that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused:

> 79.1.     Was in possession of the 164.53g of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking.

> 79.2.     Was in possession of all the other drugs found in the City Loft Apartment.

## Decision on Sentence

### Previous Convictions

82     The accused has a number of previous convictions for drug-related offences:

> 82.1.     On 6 Jan 2010, the accused was convicted of 2 counts of trafficking in a controlled drug, 1 count of abetment of importation of a controlled drug, 1 count of possession of a controlled drug, and 1 count of consumption of a specified drug. The accused was sentenced to a total of 8 years’ imprisonment and 7 strokes of the cane.

> 82.2.     On 4 Sep 2015, the accused was convicted of 2 counts of possession of a controlled drug and sentenced to a total of 2 years’ imprisonment. The accused was also sentenced to a fine in respect of unrelated traffic offences.

83     The accused was also admitted to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre on 10 Feb 2015.

### Mitigation Plea

84     The defence informed the Court that:

> 84.1.     The accused has an elderly mother in her 80s who is wheelchair bound.

> 84.2.     The accused has a newborn baby who was born after his arrest and he has not held his son.

> 84.3.     The accused has already been weaned of his addiction to drugs.

### Sentencing Approach: Trafficking Charges

85     The prosecution referred to sentencing framework for repeat offenders set out in the Judgement of Chief Justice Menon in _PP v Lai Teck Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 852</span>:

> 85.1.     First, derive the starting point for the sentence based on the quantity of drugs for first-time offenders using _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (for up to 10g of diamorphine) and _Tan Lye Heng_ (10-15g of diamorphine)

> 85.2.     Secondly, apply an _indicative uplift_ on account of the repeat offending so as to derive an indicative starting point, having regard to the circumstances of the repeat offence.

> 85.3.     Thirdly, adjust the indicative starting point based on the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors that have not been taken account in stages one and two.

86     I agreed with the prosecution’s approach in applying the framework and my own application of the framework rendered a broadly consistent result.

87     In respect of the trafficking charges, I note that the accused was previously convicted on 6 Jan 2010 of a series of drug-related offences, including the offence of drug trafficking. He was sentenced to a total of 8 years’ imprisonment. On 10 Feb 2015, he was sent to a drug rehabilitation centre and on 4 Sep 2015 he was convicted of other drug offences.

88     Given that he was arrested on 6 October 2017 for the present offences, it is clear that his previous stints in prison and drug rehabilitation have not managed to steer him away from illicit drugs. Therefore, I was of the view that there was a need for the sentence to reflect the principle of specific deterrence.

89     I also noted that there were no other exceptional mitigating or aggravating factors (over and above those already considered above) that would justify a discount or increase to the sentence.

##### DAC 906174/2018: TRAFFICKING IN 6.83G OF DIAMORPHINE

90     The starting sentence for a first time offender who trafficked in 6.83g of diamorphine would be in the region of 8 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane. I was of the view that an uplift of 7 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane was appropriate.

##### DAC 906175/18: TRAFFICKING IN 118.59G OF METHAMPHETAMINE

##### DAC 906177/18: TRAFFICKING IN 164.53 OF METHAMPHTETAMINE

91     While the table in _Lai Teck Guan_ deals with trafficking in diamorphine, I agreed with the prosecution the table could also be applied, with suitable modifications, to trafficking in methamphetamine.

92     The offence of trafficking in 167g of methamphetamine attracts a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment (hereinafter referred to as the “threshold amount”). For diamorphine, the threshold is 10g. Therefore, all other things being equal, an offender who trafficked in 167g of methamphetamine would receive the same sentence as one who trafficked in 10g of diamorphine.

93     In respect of DAC 906177/18, the amount of methamphetamine was 164.53g, which was very close to the statutory threshold. I accepted the prosecution’s submission that this would be equivalent to trafficking 9.99g of diamorphine. The starting sentence for a first offender would be in the region of 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. Given the factors discussed earlier, I was of the view that an uplift of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was appropriate.

94     In the case of _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span>, Justice Chan Seng Onn applied a slightly modified framework which indicated at \[38\] that the sentencing range for a repeat offender guilty of trafficking 9.99g of diamorphine should be 17-20 years imprisonment and caning instead of 18-21 years imprisonment and caning. Nevertheless, I was of the view that a sentence of 20 years imprisonment and 14 strokes of the cane for DAC 906177/18 was appropriate given the factors already discussed.

95     In respect of DAC 906175/18, the amount of methamphetamine was about 71% of the threshold amount. This would be roughly comparable to trafficking in 7g of diamorphine which is 70% of the threshold amount. The starting sentence would be in the region of 8 years’ imprisonment and 9 strokes of the cane. Given the factors discussed earlier, I was of the view that an uplift of 7 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was appropriate.

96     Therefore, the sentences imposed for the trafficking charges are:

##### POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED DRUGS

97     Apart from the 3 trafficking charges, the accused was convicted of 11 charges of possession of controlled drugs. The minimum mandatory sentence for each charge is 2 years imprisonment.

98     As the accused has 2 previous convictions for drug possession, I was of the view that specific deterrence was a relevant sentencing principle in this case and that a sentence was above the mandatory minimum was appropriate.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="34.28%"> <col width="32.28%"> <col width="33.44%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge Number</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 924285-DAC924294/18</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(11 charges)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession of controlled drugs (enhanced)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27 months’ imprisonment per charge</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

##### DAC 906176/18: LT-1 DRUG CONSUMPTION

99     The accused also pleaded guilty to a charge of consumption of a specified drug. As the accused had one previous conviction for consumption of a specified drug and had been previously admitted to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre, he was eligible to enhanced punishment (otherwise known as “LT-1”) under s.33A(1) MDA.

100    As there were no other aggravating factors, I imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

### Global Sentence

101    After determining the individual sentences, I had to decide on the global sentence and the sentences that should run consecutively, bearing in mind s.307 of the Criminal Procedure Code . Multiple wrong-doing is viewed more severely given the greater harm done. As a general rule, an offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence: _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\].

102    I was therefore of the view that the sentence for the most serious drug trafficking offence (DAC 906177/18) should run consecutive to the sentence for the LT-1 consumption offence (DAC 906176/18) given that the offences relate to the violation of different legally protected interests (_see Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 647</span> at \[22\].

103    After deciding on the sentences to run consecutively, I considered:

> 103.1.    Whether the aggregate sentence was sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality: _Raveen Balakrishnan (supra)_ at \[73\].

> 103.2.    Whether the global sentence was substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious individual offence (_Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[54\])

> 103.3.    Whether the sentence would be crushing on the offender and not in keeping with his past records and future prospects (_Mohamed Shouffee_ at \[57\])

104    The accused was found guilty of two separate drug trafficking transactions; one involving drugs received at Jelita Shopping Centre that morning, and the other involving drugs found at City Loft. The total weight of the methamphetamine he trafficked was 283.12g[^43] Given that he was a repeat offender and was also convicted of charges of possession and consumption of illicit drugs (as well as one more trafficking charge involving not less than 6.83g of diamorphine), I was of the view that the total sentence of **25 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes[^44]** of the cane was an appropriate sentence.

105    At the time of preparing this judgment, the accused is serving his sentence.
