### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to three charges. There was no objection to the joint trial. The three charges were as follows:

2       At the conclusion of the trial, the Accused was found guilty and convicted. He was sentenced to a global sentence of 32 months’ imprisonment. The Accused is appealing against his conviction and sentence.

## Prosecution’s Case

3       In respect to the charges numbered as DAC 923125-6/2018, the case for the Prosecution was that on 14 July 2015, the Accused also known as Mike, at different times of the day, purchased 2 diamonds from Tan Hwee Joo (PW3) by issuing two DBS cheques for a sum of $98,000 and $83,000 respectively to HL Luxury Pte Ltd. It was not disputed that the two diamonds consisting of a 5.47-carat diamond and a 3.02-carat diamond were then delivered to the Accused.

4       The $98,000 cheque (exhibit 7) was deposited by PW3 for clearance but he was informed on 16 July 2015 that the cheque bounced. Since, the first cheque was dishonoured, PW3 decided not to cash in the $83,000 cheque.

5       PW3 would not have delivered the two diamonds to the Accused if the cheques given to him could not be honoured.

6       The Accused then signed a document dated 23 July 2015 prepared by PW3. See exhibit P8. In P8, the Accused admitted that he attempted to cheat PW3. The Accused also confessed that when he issued the two cheques (P6 and P7) for the payment of the two diamonds, he knew that the 2 cheques would not be cleared due to insufficient fund in the bank account. He also agreed to make payment of $181,000, the sum total of P6 and P7, to PW3 by 30 December 2015.

7       The Accused did not make the full payment as agreed. Consequently, PW3 lodged a police report dated 19 January 2016. See exhibit P9.

8       In respect of the other charge (DAC-923127-2018), the victim was one Tan Hong Thiang (PW1). He was in the business of buying and selling jewellery. The Accused was also in the jewellery business. It was not in dispute that both PW1 and the Accused had previous business transactions. It was clear that on previous occasions the Accused would borrow money from PW1 by placing some jewellery as collateral. If the Accused could not repay, PW1 would sell the jewellery to satisfy the debt owing to him.

9       It was the Prosecution’s case that on 4 February 2016, the Accused issued two Maybank cash cheques (P1 and P2) to PW1 to redeem the jewellery from PW1. See Day 1 Transcripts at page 6, lines 2-11. PW1 delivered the jewellery back to the Accused. The jewellery were two diamonds, one diamond bangle and one Audemars Piguet Ginza Model 094/200. See exhibit P3. These were said to be “sold” to him on 31 January 2016 by the Accused and were bought back by the Accused on 4 February 2016. Both the said two Maybank cheques were dated 4 February 2016 and were cash cheques.

10     On presentation of these two cheques, they were not honoured.

## The Defence

11     The Defence was that these three incidents were genuine business transactions and that the Accused did not intend to deceive PW1 and PW3.

12     In summary, the Defence alleged that in respect of DAC 923125-6/2018, it was PW3 who delivered the two diamonds for sale by the Accused. For this, the Accused gave PW3, the two DBS cheques with the instruction that there was insufficient fund for both the cheques to be cleared and that PW3 was to cash the cheques only upon the sale of the diamonds. Counsel submitted that it was a “consignment situation in which Mike bore the risk of selling the diamonds at a lower price than what he would have to pay to PW3, in return for the possibility of a profit if he managed to sell them for more.”

13     In respect of the charge involving PW1, the Accused claimed that it was a loan from PW1 and that all the four items of jewellery and watch were still in the possession of PW1.

## Analysis of the Evidence

### (1) Case involving victim PW3

14     I will first deal with the charges involving PW3. The Defence contended that PW3 was an unreliable witness in that he gave inconsistent evidence.

15     It was submitted that PW3’s police report (P9) and his testimony in court was inconsistent. Counsel took issue with the order of dealing with the diamonds. PW3 admitted he made a mistake as to which diamond that Mike had bought first. He clarified that the Accused bought the 5.47-carat diamond first. This was consistent with the sequence in which the cheque was numbered. Accordingly, I found that the Accused bought the 5.47-carat diamond first by issuing a DBS cheque for $98,000 (P7) and a while later he bought the other diamond by issuing another cheque (P6). I did not think the order of dealing with the diamonds was a material issue. In any event, PW3 was forthcoming in admitting to the mistake and allowance must be given for the inability to recollect an event that took place a few years ago. See _Ng Chiew Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR 370</span>.

16     All considered, I found PW3 to be a truthful and reliable witness. I accepted PW3’s evidence that on 14 July 2015 at different times, Mike went to HJ Luxury Pte Ltd (“HJ”) to buy 2 diamonds and issued 2 cheques (P6 and P7) to pay for it. First, he bought the 5.47-carat diamond and issued P7 to pay for it. In respect of the 3.02-carat diamond that he bought about 2 hours later, Mike issued P6 to pay for it. Accordingly, the two diamonds were delivered to Mike who instructed PW3 not to bank in both cheques on the same day. He was to cash P7 first and the other cheque a few days later. The reason given by Mike was that he was expecting payment from his supplier. PW3 believed that both the cheques would be cleared. Hence, he banked in P7 as Mike told him there was sufficient fund for one cheque to be honoured. However, on 16 July 2015, the bank informed him that P7 bounced. Thereupon, PW3 informed Mike that P7 bounced and Mike requested for a few more days for the cheque to be cleared. PW3 did not immediately lodge a police report to give Mike a “second chance”. However, Mike did not treasure it. In the meantime, PW3 did not bank in P6 as he did not think it would be honoured. It was only on 19 Jan 2016 after the Accused has failed to pay by 30 December 2015 as stipulated in exhibit P8 that the police report was lodged (P9).

17     With respect, I rejected the bald allegation by the Accused that the transaction was a consignment. PW3 denied such an allegation. This bald allegation was inconsistent with the Accused’s own written confession (exhibit P8) which he had signed. In P8 dated 23 July 2015, the Accused admitted he “attempted to cheat” PW3 and confessed that he issued the said 2 cheques (P6 and P7) for payment of the two diamonds knowing that it would not be honoured due to the lack of funds in the bank account. P8 did not state it was a case of consignment. On the contrary, the tenor of P8 indicated it was a sale and purchase. If otherwise, there would not be a need for the payment upon the delivery of the diamonds.

18     The Accused claimed that he signed P8 under the influence of “fear” as he felt threatened. With respect, this was again a bare assertion. There was no police report lodged about the threat. There was also no shred of such evidence in the WhatsApp messages tendered in court by the Accused. See exhibit D1. On the other hand, he did not deny that he issued the two cheques on 14 July 2015 when there was insufficient funds in the bank account.

19     I found that in respect of the DBS cheques (P6 for the sum of $83,000 and P7 for the sum of $98,000), they were drawn on the bank account 001-905312-9. Both cheques were dated 14 July 2015. Exhibit P5 was the bank statement of account 001-905312-9 for the period 1 June 2015 to 30 September 2015. Based on exhibit P5, as at 15 July 2015, there were insufficient fund in the account to clear these two cheques (P6 and P7).

20     Based on the above, I found PW3 was deceived into delivering the 5.47-carat diamond and the 3.02-carat diamond to the Accused on 14 July 2015 upon the latter providing him with the two cheques for the payment. It was clear that PW3 would not have delivered the two diamonds to the Accused if he knew that the cheques would not be honoured.

21     I also found that there was a dishonest or fraudulent intent on the part of the Accused to induce PW3 into delivering the two diamonds by presenting to him the two dud cheques on 14 July 2015. This was supported by the circumstantial evidence as well as exhibit P8 that was considered above. Let me elaborate.

22     Firstly, there were multiple occasions when the cheques issued by the Accused on behalf of his company were dishonoured by DBS bank. In June 2015, four cheques were dishonoured. In July 2015, there were six cheques not cleared including P6. In these circumstances, the Accused knew when he issued P6 and P7 that there would not be sufficient funds in the bank account to honour the cheques. The Accused claimed that he was hoping for funds coming in. However, this was not bore out in evidence. There was nothing tendered to show there were significant receivables payable to his company during the material time.

23     I agreed with the Prosecution that on 15 July 2015, there was a withdrawal of $500 made and the Accused would have known that the balance in the bank account was insufficient to honour the cheques drawn on 14 July 2015. The allegation by the Accused that the 3.02-carat diamond was for a customer was clearly a ruse to deceive PW3 into believing that there would be money to honour the cheque. The Accused did not call the so-called customer to evidence. I therefore rejected the allegation by the Accused.

### (2) Cheating the Victim Tan Hong Thiang

24     I now consider the case involving the other victim Tan Hong Thiang (PW1).

25     Miss Chan Bee Peng (PW4) was a bank executive with Maybank. There was no allegation that she was an unreliable witness. I accepted her evidence.

26     Exhibit P4 showed the bank transactions from January 2016 to 5 February 2016. PW4 explained that where there was a charge of $50 it indicated that it was for the return of cheque due to insufficient fund. With reference to P4, in respect of cheque 25 drawn for $10,000 by the account holder Tresor Diamonds Pte Ltd (“Tresor”), there was a charge of $50 as the cheque dated 20 Jan 2016 bounced because of insufficient fund. As at 5 February 2016, this account was overdrawn by $172.62 and the account was closed by the bank as of 5 February 2016.

27     PW4 was referred to exhibit P10. She confirmed that for the November 2015 bank statement, Tresor had drawn four cheques. Out of these four cheques drawn, one cheque was returned to drawer due to insufficient fund while the other three cheques were returned to drawer due to technical errors. PW4 confirmed that for the December 2015 bank statement, it showed another four cheques drawn by Tresor. Out of these four cheques, three were returned due to insufficient funds while the other one cheque was returned due to technical errors.

28     Based on P4 and P10, from November 2015 to 5 February 2016, there were 10 cheques drawn on the account maintained by Tresor. Out of these 10 cheques, none was successfully cleared by the bank. PW4 also confirmed that whenever a cheque was returned the account holder would be notified.

29     Due to the “repeated occurrences of returned cheques”, the Bank closed the account maintained by Tresor. PW4 explained it meant that there were multiple returned cheques due to insufficient funds in the account. The Bank will issue a letter to inform that the account will be closed. This the Bank has done by a letter dated 21 January 2016 (exhibit P11) informing Tresor of the closing of the account in 14 days from 21 January 2016. The account was closed on 5 February 2016. See exhibit P4.

30     The Defence did not challenge that Maybank did send the letter in exhibit P11. PW4 was not questioned on this at all. Neither was PW4 questioned as to whether it was sent to the correct address. Hence, I rejected the allegation by the Accused that he had no knowledge of the account closure.

31     I found that based on exhibit P4, the bank account was opened on 5 May 2015 and closed on 5 February 2016. It was also clear to me that there were insufficient funds to honour cheques P1 and P2 on 4 February 2016. It was also speculative to determine whether if monies were banked in after 4 February 2016 what would happen. I found there was no evidence adduced that there was indeed such a deposit made before 5 February 2016, the date the account was closed.

32     Tan Hong Thiang (PW1) knew the Accused as Mike Cao who was in the jewellery business. PW1 was also in the business of buying and selling jewellery.

33     In 2015 and 2016, Mike approached PW1 for money. PW1 would give money to him when Mike placed some jewellery with PW1. They would be sold if Mike were unable to repay the money. Having sold some of these, there were still some left with PW1. Both of them had done a few transactions of this nature before the present case.

34     Sometime in 31 January 2016, Mike contacted PW1 that he was in need of money. He wanted to sell to PW1, two diamonds, 1 diamond bangle and one an Audemars Piguet Ginza model 094/200 watch (I will name them including the watch collectively as “jewellery”). PW1 bought them and gave the Accused the cash. On 3 February 2016, the Accused wanted to buy back the items. See exhibit P3 dated 24 March 2016.

35     Consequently, Mike went to PW1’s residence and issued to PW1 two Maybank cheques dated 4 February 2016 (exhibits P1 and P2) in exchange for the jewellery he had placed with PW1. See day 1 Transcripts at page 7 lines 4 – 7 and page 11 lines 14-17.

36     PW1 testified that Mike issued to him two cheques, namely Maybank cheques 000026 and 000027 for S$9180 and S$21,210 respectively. Both these cheques were “cash” cheques dated 4 February 2016. They were not post-dated cheques. In fact, Mike told him to cash the cheques the same day and that was why he banked in the cheques that day. The total amount of these two cheques amounted to $30,390. Out of the $30390, $390 was for the repair of his watch.

37     PW1 went to the bank to cash these cheques on 4 February 2016 but they were dishonoured. The bank told him to refer to drawer.

38     PW1 would not have returned the jewellery to Mike if he were unable to cash the cheques.

39     Immediately upon the dishonour of the cheques, PW1 called Mike but the latter was unable to meet him.

40     PW1 also clarified during the cross-examination that the jewellery were left with him and Mike was given one month to redeem them. PW1 agreed with counsel that P1 was the collateral for the bangle and 2 diamonds while P2 was the collateral for the watch. He agreed that he was lending Mike money with the watch and jewellery as security. However, this was inconsistent with P3. He was asked:

> “You lied to police because you did not want to expose yourself as a money lender who lends money for interest, agree or disagree” See day 1 Transcripts at page 40 lines 18-21.

41     PW1 disagreed.

42     PW1 agreed that his police report P3 gave the impression that Mike sold the items to him. He also agreed that by 5 February 2016, he no longer had the watch, diamonds and bangle.

43     PW1 was shown a series of WhatsApp messages between him and Mike. See exhibit D1, page 19 at time stamp 6/2/16 from 11:11:09 to 11:17:32 and 15/2/16 from 18:34:19 to 17/2/16 at 12:59:38 regarding a ‘d cartier’ bangle. PW1 disagreed that on 6 February 2016 or 17 February 2016 he had the De Cartier bangle. PW1 explained that the police report P3 was not referring to the De Cartier bangle. The WhatsApp messages were in relation to a different transaction. See day 1 Transcripts at page 44 line 14 to page 45 line 4.

44     Counsel referred PW1 to exhibit D1 at page 28, time stamp 7/9/16 at 12:27:33 to show that PW1 was still holding on to the watch. PW1 replied that it was a different watch. Counsel also referred PW1 to D1 at page 30, time stamp 8/11/16 suggesting that PW1 was still having the watch. PW1 replied that this was a different watch from that stated in his police report (P3). In P3, the watch was specified as “Audemars Piguet Ginza model 094/200.” PW1 further added that he and Mike had some dealings in watches before this case.

45     Counsel persisted on questioning PW1 that he still had the watch and the payment of interest for the money borrowed by referring to D1 at page 31, time stamp 12/11/2016 at 14:44 to 7/12/16 at 09:52:12. PW1 disagreed.

46     Despite the vigorous cross-examination by counsel, I found that PW1 was unwavering and I accepted his evidence that he had returned to the Accused all the jewellery on 4 February 2016. I also bore in mind the fact that the Accused and PW1 had done a few transactions besides the current subject matters. This explained why there were references in the WhatsApp messages to the seemingly similar items that were the subject matters of the present court proceedings.

47     When shown exhibit D2, PW1 said that this was not the watch which he referred to in P3. It referred to another watch for which PW1 loaned him $7,000. It related to a different transaction. I noted that D1 at page 18, time stamp 4/2/16, PW1 received a message from the Accused stating that he wanted to see PW1 to “take the diamond to settle all the things”. This supported PW1’s evidence that Mike came to take the items from him.

48     I found there were inconsistences in the evidence of PW1 but they were minor and did not detract from the fact that the majority of his evidence was corroborated and consistent. For example, he was consistently clear that the jewellery had been delivered to the Accused on 4 February 2016 in exchange for the 2 cheques issued by the Accused. I did not doubt that his police report (exhibit P3) gave the impression that Mike sold the items to him when in reality it was a pledge with interest to be paid. In any event, this did not mean that all his other evidence could not be believed. See _De Silva v PP_ \[1964\] 1 MLJ 181.

49     In my view, the conduct of PW1 supported the fact that he was the victim deceived by the Accused. Immediately upon the dishonour of the cheques, he immediately tried to contact the Accused and finally met up with him at a coffee shop. The Accused asked for more time to pay but failed to pay fully which then led to the filing of the police report on 24 March 2016.

50     Next, I found there was a dishonest or fraudulent intention by the Accused to induce PW1 to deliver the jewellery to him. The circumstantial evidence on this issue was very cogent. It showed the Accused knew that he was unable to honour the two Maybank cheques (P1 and P2) when the jewellery were delivered to him. Firstly, for the period November 2015 to January 2016, there were multiple cheques issued by the Accused that were returned due to insufficient funds in the bank account. The account holder would be informed whenever a cheque was returned. Hence, it was clear that the Accused knew that when he issued the two Maybank cheques they would not be honoured. Moreover, I found that the account holder was informed of the closure of the account on 5 February 2016. See exhibits P11 and P4. This fortified my finding that the Accused knew that the Maybank cheques dated 4 February 2016 could not be cleared due to the closure of the account on 5 February 2016.

51     Another factor was the fact that by 30 December 2015, the Accused was unable to fulfil his obligations stated in exhibit P8. See also Exhibit P9. Despite this, he still issued two cash cheques to PW1. Clearly, considering all the circumstances, there was a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the part of the Accused in issuing these two cash cheques to cheat PW1.

52     In the circumstances, I found that on 4 February 2016, the Accused by issuing the two Maybank cheques which he knew would not be cleared, dishonestly induced PW1 into delivering the jewellery to him which he would not have done so if not so deceived.

## Credibility of Accused

53     I found the Accused to be not a credible witness.

54     The Accused claimed that the WhatsApp chat log was accurate and unedited. However, as seen in exhibit P12, he had removed the highlighted messages. I agreed with the Prosecution that this showed that “the Accused intended to paint a different picture- one more favourable to his case”.

55     I found the Accused also fudged his evidence in court when he claimed that his client shown interest in the 5.47-carat diamond. However, there was no shred of evidence produced to support the claim. He also exaggerated that he had paid $63,000 to $65,000 for the limited edition of the watch when there was no proof tendered to support his claim. It would also seem illogical that for such a high value watch he was only given about $30,000 or $40,000 for all the items he pledged with PW1.

56     The assertion made by the Accused that he was merely helping PW3 to sell the two diamonds was unbelievable in the light of the fact that he had issued two dud DBS cheques for the diamonds worth about $181,000. There was also no document to support such an allegation. The Accused’s assertion was clearly untrue in the light of the fact that he had pawned the diamonds to a company known as “SME Capital”. I also disbelieved that there was an instalment agreement if the diamonds could not be sold.

57     The Accused claimed that the Maybank cheques were issued to PW1 when he received the cash from PW1 on 31 January 2016. However, he could not give a reasonable explanation as to why the cheques were dated 4 February 2016 and were cash cheques. I also disbelieved the Accused’s allegation that the jewellery were always with PW1. If this were the case, there was no logical reason for him to issue to PW1 the two Maybank cheques.

58     In the circumstances, I found the Accused to be an unreliable witness and accordingly I rejected his defence.

## Guilty and Convicted

59     Having considered the evidence and the written submissions of the parties, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was guilty of the three charges proffered against him. Accordingly, he was convicted.

## Antecedents

60     The Accused was untraced.

## Submissions on Sentence

61     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment. See Prosecution’s written submission. The individual sentences submitted were as follows:

> (1)     DAC-923125-2018 (issuance of dishonoured cheque for $98,000 to Tan Hwee Joo), a sentence of 27 months’ imprisonment

> (2)     DAC-923126-2018 (issuance of dishonoured cheque for $83,000 to Tan Hwee Joo), a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment

> (3)     DAC-923127-2018 (two dishonoured cheques for S$9,180 and S$21,210 respectively issued to Tan Hong Thiang), a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment.

62     The Defence submitted for a total imprisonment term of 15 months and 3 weeks (15.75months). See Defence’s written submission. The individual sentences submitted were as follows:

> (1)     DAC-923125-2018 – 9 months’ imprisonment

> (2)     DAC-923126-2018 – 9.5 months’ imprisonment

> (3)     DAC-923127-2018 – 6.75 months’ imprisonment.

## Sentencing Considerations

63     I agreed with the Prosecution that the main sentencing considerations ought to be general and specific deterrence as the offences involved the issuance of dishonoured cheques and that the offences were premeditated.

## Prescribed Punishment

64     I noted that the offence under section 420 Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment of up to 10 years and can be imposed together with a fine.

## Sentencing Factors

65     I took into account the factors highlighted by the Prosecution. Firstly, the amount involved in the cheating was a substantial sum of $210,000.

66     Next, there was planning and premeditation as evidenced by the nature of the offences committed.

67     There was no full remorse shown by the Accused. I noted that he made no restitution to Tan Hong Thiang and only made 18.5% restitution ($33,400) to Tan Hwee Joo.

## Mitigation

68     Counsel submitted that the Accused’s deception was limited in that he “ran a legitimate business and used legitimate company cheques, albeit with insufficient funds”. It was not an elaborate and well-planned fraud committed over a prolonged period. It involved two victims and one of which received partial restitution of S$33,400.

69     Counsel also highlighted that the Accused was untraced.

70     It was submitted that the Accused suffered severe mental anxiety and distress caused by an inordinate delay in the prosecution that he was not at all responsible for. “The police reports were made in the first quarter of 2016, no charges were brought for more than 2 years until June 2018.” “By the time of his conviction on 3 March 2020, more than 4 years had elapsed since the police reports were first made.” It was therefore submitted that there should be a discount of 3 months to the sentences and should result in the final sentences submitted by counsel as per \[62\] above.

## Decision on Sentence

71     Bearing in mind the sentencing considerations, the nature of the offences committed and having considered the aggravating factors and mitigation, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

> (1)     DAC-923125-2018 – 20 months’ imprisonment

> (2)     DAC-923126-2018 – 20 months’ imprisonment

> (3)     DAC-923127-2018 – 12 months’ imprisonment.

72     In coming to the decision on the sentences, I took into account particularly the substantial sum of money involved, the lack of full remorse and the elements of planning and premeditation. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the Accused “intentionally signed and issued the cheques in front of them in order to give them the confidence that the cheques would be honoured.” To cloak his dishonesty, he also told PW3 that he had a customer who was interested in the diamond.

73     On the other hand, I gave credit to the Accused for making partial restitution and his lack of antecedents.

74     I also noted that there were two victims and the period over which the criminal enterprise was carried on was from July 2015 to February 2016. The nature of the criminal enterprise was the issuance of worthless cheques. It was relatively not so complex and sophisticated.

75     The Defence alleged that there were inordinate delays in the prosecution of the Accused and that the Accused suffered severe mental anxiety and distress caused by the inordinate delay in the prosecution.

76     With due respect, I was unable to agree that there was inordinate delay in the prosecution of the Accused. There was some degree of delay but it was not inordinate and the Prosecution was not solely responsible for the delay. The Prosecution stated that there was lack of co-operation on the part of the Accused. It was clear that the Defence had contributed to the delays as the Defence had applied to vacate hearing dates due to the need to attend to hearings at the High Court. I was of the view that the nature of the offences and the circumstances warranted a reasonable amount of time for investigation and preparation for trial. In this case, the Prosecution needed the co-operation of two banks to provide the necessary information relating to the dishonoured cheques. I was also not satisfied that there was any real injustice to the Accused caused by the alleged delays. Hence, the delays, if at all, should be accorded little mitigating value.

77     With respect, I also rejected the claim that the severe mental anxiety and distress were caused by the alleged inordinate delay in the prosecution. I was of the view that in all or most prosecutions there will be some anxiety and distress caused to the parties involved. On the other hand, in this case, there was no evidence of the severity of anxiety and distress caused. I therefore gave no or little weight to this factor.

78     It was alleged that during the “prolonged period of police investigation, Cao also developed mild muscle bridging in his coronary artery and experienced chest discomfort and mild breathlessness when talking and walking at the same time”. But the medical evidence tendered indicated that these could be attributed to his lifestyle, overweight and physical exercise.

79     The Defence also highlighted the inconvenience and economic impact caused by the retention of the Accused’s passport. I was of the view that this was the result of his own doing. There was nothing to stop him to seek the court’s assistance for the release of the passport. Hence, I rejected this allegation as a mitigating factor.

## Precedents

80     Both the Prosecution and Defence have referred to various sentencing precedents to support their respective submissions.

81     The Prosecution has tendered a comparative table of precedents that is reproduced below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0160_Image/[2020] SGDC 0160_image1.png)

82     The cases cited by the Prosecution were factually different from the current case. But it serves as an useful guide for the sentences imposed for cheating offences involving different sum of money.

83     The Defence, on the other hand, referred to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Sim Tiang Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 169</span> (“_Sim Tiang Huat_”), _Public Prosecutor v Julaiha binte Juraimi_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 183</span> (“_Julaiha_”) and _Public Prosecutor v Wong Cheng Rui_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 325</span> (“_Wong Cheng Rui_”).

84     In the case of _Sim Tiang Huat_, the District Court sentenced the offender to 16 months’ imprisonment for each of the 5 proceeded charges of cheating (involving a sum of $48,853.75) with 3 of the sentences to run consecutively for a total sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment. This case involved the issuance of worthless cheques to induce the victims to deliver the goods before the cheques could be cleared. The offences were committed over a period of two months. The total amount involved including the charges taken into consideration was S$118,943.33 and about half of which ($64,977.93) was successfully recovered by the police. I noted that at \[19\] of the case, the District Judge noted that “o(O)ne indicator of the seriousness of a property offence is the amount involved: _Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] SLR 1011</span> at para 18. In the present case, the offender was convicted of being involved in cheating a number of victims out of $48,853.75. If the charges that were taken into consideration are included, the total amount is $118,943.33. A first offender who is convicted of a s.420 cheating offence involving $50,000 to $100,000 would face a starting sentence between 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.”

85     In _Julaija_’s case, the offender was convicted after trial of 21 charges of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code. “The offender perpetrated an “elaborate and well-planned” 4 investment scams to repeatedly defraud 8 victims of a total of S$600,000. Even by the end of the trial, more than S$100,000 remained untraced and unaccounted for. The District Court sentenced the offender to inter alia 30 months’ imprisonment for a cheating charge involving S$150,000, 16 months’ imprisonment for a cheating charge involving S$60,000, and 13 months’ imprisonment for a cheating charge involving S$30,000. After making the relevant adjustments pursuant to the totality principle and the one transaction rule, the total imprisonment sentence for all 21 charges was 72 months’ or 6 years’ imprisonment.”

86     As for the case of _Wong Cheng Rui_, I was of the view that it was not instructive as it concerned an offence under section 417 of the Penal Code which carries a much lower penalty than section 420 of the Penal Code.

87     I was also of the view that _Julaija_’s _case_ and the case of _Sim Tiang Huat_ were factually different from the current case except that the case of _Sim Tiang Huat_ involved the issuance of worthless cheques like the present case. Hence, the latter case would be more instructive. In any event, they do provide a guide as to the sentences meted out for the various offences involving different sums of money.

88     In light of the above and the circumstances in the present case, the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment in respect of DAC-923127-2018 was reasonable and consistent with the sentence meted out in _Sin Be Sen Paul v Public Prosecutor_ (MA-9042-2017-01) <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 147</span>.

89     The sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment in respect of DAC-923125-2018 was also in line with the _Lim Soon Heng v Public Prosecutor_ (MA 481/93/01) (“_Lim Soon Heng_”) in view of the fact that there was partial restitution of $33,400.

90     As for the sentence in respect of DAC-923126-2018, the sentence imposed was 20 months’ imprisonment. It was within the range of sentence indicated in _Sim Tiang Huat_ at \[19\]. This sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment was calibrated to take into account the totality of the criminal enterprise.

## Conclusion

91     As highlighted by the Prosecution, “i\[I\]n determining an appropriate global sentence, the Court must determine the appropriate sentence for each charge and then holistically determine which sentences should be ordered to run consecutively to make for an appropriate global sentence, having regard to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle: _Public Prosecutor v Syamsul Hilal bin Ismail_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 973</span> at \[26\];11 _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[27\] and \[47\].” In the circumstances, the sentences in DAC-923126-2018 and DAC-923127-2018 were ordered to run consecutively. Hence, the global sentence received by the Accused was 32 months’ imprisonment. In my view, it was not excessive and was in line with the precedents cited by the parties.

92     The Accused is currently on bail.
