### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       Native to tropical and temperate areas, cannabis goes by various monikers, one of which is _Ganja_. Cannabis is harmful to health and outlawed by the Misuse of Drugs Act. This case was a joint-trial of two Accused Persons for importing cannabis.

2       Given that the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused Persons, both of them were convicted. I set out my reasons.

## Charges and legal context

3       Mr Adaikalaraj a/l Iruthayam (“**B1**”) faced two charges under s 7 punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA):

> (a)     One count of importing not less than 402.7 grams of cannabis, and

> (b)     One count of importing not less than 541.2 grams of cannabis mixture.

4       The 2 charges were as follows:

> You, ADAIKALARAJ A/L IRUTHAYAM, are charged that you, on 22 November 2014, at about 1pm, at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, on a Malaysian registered motorcar bearing registration number WGN 4531, did import into Singapore, a controlled drug listed in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“the MDA”), _to wit_, one block containing not less than **402.7 grams** of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be **cannabis**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 of the MDA, which is punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> You, ADAIKALARAJ A/L IRUTHAYAM, are charged that you, on 22 November 2014, at about 1pm, at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, on a Malaysian registered motorcar bearing registration number WGN 4531, did import into Singapore, a controlled drug listed in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“the MDA”), _to wit_, one block containing not less than **541.2 grams** of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol, and the vegetable matter was therefore **cannabis mixture**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 of the MDA, which is punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

5       Mr Suresh s/o Krishnan (“**B2**”) faced one charge under s 7 read with s 12 punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA for abetting by conspiring to import the said cannabis.

6       The charge was as follows:

> You, SURESH S/O KRISHNAN, are charged that you, on or about 16 November 2014 in Singapore, did abet by engaging in a conspiracy with one Adaikalaraj A/L Iruthayam (Malaysian) to a certain thing, namely, to import into Singapore, a controlled drug listed in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)(“the MDA”), and in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, namely, on 22 November 2014, at about 1pm, at Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, the said Adaikalarj A/L Iruthayam, on a Malaysian registered motorcar bearing registration number WGN 4531, did import into Singapore one block containing not less than **402.7 grams** of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to be **cannabis**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 of the MDA read with s 12 of the same Act, and which is punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

7       By way of background, at the start of the trial, B2 had faced 2 charges, including one count of abetting by conspiring to import cannabis mixture. However, this cannabis mixture charge was later withdrawn by the Prosecution.

8       B1 was represented during the trial by Mr Revi Shanker s/o K. Annamalai until counsel’s application to discharge himself was granted on 7 August 2017. Similarly, B2 was represented during the trial by Mr Ramesh Tiwary until counsel’s application to discharge himself was granted on 26 September 2017.

9       On the day of the closing submissions for the trial, B1 was present but B2 was absent. A warrant of arrest was issued for B2.

10     Meanwhile, B1 was convicted and sentenced. B1 filed a notice of appeal on 27 November 2017 against both conviction and sentence, and his sentence was stayed.

11     B2 was arrested in 2018. The trial for B2 resumed after his arrest. B2 was now represented by Mr Kalidass Murugaiyan and Mr Chua Hock Lu. They applied to recall B1 for further cross-examination. After considering both sides’ written submissions and oral replies, I did not allow the application to recall B1 for further cross-examination.

12     The Prosecution and Defence Counsel for B2 then asked for the trial to be put on hold pending the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Saravanan Chandaram v Public Prosecutor_ (C.A. No. 46/2017). This was done. After the decision in _Saravanan Chandaram v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 43</span> at \[173\]-\[197\] and \[199\] (“_Saravanan Chandaram_”), the Prosecution withdrew the cannabis mixture charge against B2.

13      **Importation of Drugs**. Section 7 of the MDA reads:

> Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to **import** into or export from Singapore a controlled drug. \[emphasis added in bold\]

14     The three elements of an importation charge under s 7 of the MDA are:

> (a)     The accused person was in possession of the drugs,

> (b)     He had knowledge of the nature of the drugs, and

> (c)     The drugs were intentionally brought into Singapore without prior authorisation (_Adili Chibuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 254</span> at \[27\]).

> (see Rennie Whang, _The Doctrine of Wilful Blindness in Drug Offences: Adili Chibuike Ejike_, <span class="citation">(2020) 32 SAcLJ 305</span> at \[9\])

15      Actus Reus. ‘Import’ is defined as ‘to bring or caused to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air’: s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 1997 Rev Ed).

16     The Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Adnan bin Kadir_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 1052</span> at \[70\] clarified that s 7 of the MDA does not require the Prosecution to prove that the importation was for the purposes of trafficking (see Tham Lijing, _The Curious Case of Drug Importation_, Law Gazette (September 2013) at footnote 32). In the present case, the importation element in s 7 was satisfied the moment the drugs were brought physically into Singapore (_Pham Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 571</span> at \[23\]).

17      Mens Rea. For conceptual clarity, there are three ways to prove the _mens rea_ for a drug importation offence – actual knowledge, wilful blindness, and the presumption of knowledge under s 18(2) of the MDA (see, for example, _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 39</span> at \[110\], and _Public Prosecutor v Khartik Jasudass and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 199</span> at \[53\]-\[58\]). Although _Khartik Jasudass_ is a drug trafficking case, the three ways of proving _mens rea_ apply equally to drug importation.

18      **Abetment by Conspiracy to Import Drugs**. Section 12 of the MDA reads:

> Any person who **abets** the commission of or who attempts to commit or does any act preparatory to, or in furtherance of, the commission of any offence under this Act shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable on conviction to the punishment provided for that offence. \[emphasis added in bold\]

19     “Abet” has the same meaning in s 12 of the MDA and s 107 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed): _Chan Heng Kong and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 18</span> at \[33\]-\[34\] and _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh_ at \[45\] (see also Too Xing Ji, _Unforeseen Consequences: Difficulties in Punishing the Foreign Abetment of Singapore Drug Offences_, <span class="citation">(2017) 29 SAcLJ 294</span> at \[14\]-\[57\] and \[55\]).

20     The Prosecution has to prove two ingredients for abetment by conspiracy to import drugs into Singapore:

> (a)     The existence of a conspiracy to import the drugs, and

> (b)     The importation was actually carried out (_Public Prosecutor v Yeo Choon_ Poh <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 302</span> at \[19\]).

21     The essence of a conspiracy is agreement. In most cases, the actual agreement takes place in private such that direct evidence of it will rarely be available: _Public Prosecutor v Sugianto bin Pardi and another_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 865</span> at \[55\].

22     One method of proving a conspiracy is to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in pursuing a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. These actions and words do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but rather constitute evidence of the conspiracy: _Muhammad Afzal Khan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGCA 43</span> at \[34\]-\[35\].

23     Physical presence with co-conspirators is not essential to proving a conspiracy: _Yeo Choon Poh_ at \[26\] and \[44\] (see Stanley Yeo, Chan Wing Cheong, and Neil Morgan, _Criminal Law in Malaysia and Singapore (Singapore: LexisNexis, Revised Second Ed, 2015)_ at \[34.51\]).

24     No requirement in law exists that the alleged conspirators should remain in each other’s company throughout or at all: _Yeo Choon Poh_ at \[19\]. This is consistent with explanation 5 of s 108 of the Penal Code: _Lim Teck Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 525</span> at \[6\].

25     In the present case, both ingredients for the charges of abetment by conspiracy to import drugs into Singapore were made out. The importation was carried out the moment the drugs were brought physically into Singapore. For reasons set out below, I also found that there was a conspiracy to import the drugs.

## Statement of agreed facts

26      Financial transactions between B1 and B2. On 22 November 2014 at about 3.39.41 am, B2 transferred S$1,000 to an account given to him by B1 using the account belonging to his then-girlfriend, Nur Falliana binte Ismail.

27     After transferring the monies to B1, he texted B1 to inform him that the transfer was done.

28      Arrest of B1. On 22 November 2014, B1 drove the car bearing the Malaysian-registered number plate WGN4531 (“the car”) from Johor, Malaysia, into the Motor Car Clearance Lane (Arrival) at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore (see sketch plan of Woodlands Checkpoint marked P3). He was the only person in the said car.

29     At about 1pm, on the same day, an officer from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“the ICA”), CI(2) Abdul Rahim bin Ramadan (“CI(2) Abdul Rahim”), directed B1 to drive the said car into the 100% Inspection Pit for further checks. B1 complied and drove into an inspection pit located at the Motor Car Secondary Clearance Area.

30     Before the commencement of the inspection of his car, B1 switched off his engine and handed over his Malaysian Passport, Malaysian IC and his Work Permit to the ICA officers.

31     Thereafter, CI(2) Abdul Rahim, with two other officers from the ICA, proceeded to conduct a search on the car. B1 was instructed to open the bonnet of the said car. Upon opening the said bonnet, the ICA officers saw a red plastic bag near the car battery.

32     Subsequently, the red plastic bag was found to contain a one block of vegetable matter wrapped in clear cling wrap, and which was haphazardly wrapped in newspaper (“the drug exhibit”). The position where the said plastic bag was found in the bonnet was subsequently marked “A”. The block of vegetable matter (initially marked as A1A1 by the CNB) is marked as P4. The newspaper and red plastic bag used to wrap the said block are marked as P5 and P6 respectively.

33     On the suspicion that the vegetable matter were drugs, the ICA officers alerted officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“the CNB”) who were attached to the CNB “F” Woodlands Checkpoint. Three CNB officers, SSSgt Muhammad Yazid Abdullah (“SSSgt Muhammad Yazid”), W/Sgt Nurul Aidia Othman (“W/Sgt Nurul Aidia”) and SSgt Jagan s/o Ganasekaran (“SSgt Jagan”), proceeded to the Inspection Pit where the car was parked.

34     At about 1.12pm, while the other two CNB officers looked on, W/Sgt Nurul Aidia Othman retrieved the drug exhibit from the bonnet of the car and placed the said exhibit into a tamper-proof bag. B1’s handphone, a Lenovo, containing two SIM Cards and a Micro SDHC Card, which was subsequently marked as “AI-HP1” was also seized (marked as P7). The numbers linked to the two SIM Cards found in AI-HP1 were XXX and XXX.

35     SSgt Jagan then took B1 into custody.

36     Thereafter, B1 was escorted to the CNB office, where W/Sgt Nurul Aidia handed the drug exhibits to SSgt Jagan. Thereafter SSgt Jagan returned the said drug exhibits to W/Sgt Nurul Aidia.

37     At about 3pm on the same day, SSSgt Muhammad Yazid lodged a police report (J/20141122/2084) on the arrest of B1, and the seizure of the said drug exhibit (marked as P8).

38     At about 10.05pm on the same day, SSSgt Simon Teo handed over the two tamper-proof bags containing the said drug exhibits to the former investigation officer, ASP Xie Junhao Angus (“IO Angus”).

39      Arrest of B2. On 26 November 2014, B2 (and his brother) were arrested by CNB officers, namely, SSgt Sunny Tay, Cpl Yogaraj Ragunathan and SSgt Sunny Chien, at his residential address.

40     A search was conducted on the said premises. No drugs or illegal cigarettes were found in the said unit.

41     At about 2.40pm on the same day, the CNB officers found a locked safe located in a cupboard in one of the bedrooms in the said unit. A blue Samsung handphone (marked as “SK-HP4”) and three loose SIM Cards (marked as “SK-SIM1”, “SKSIM2” and “SK-SIM3”) were found in the said safe which was opened in B2’s presence (collectively marked as P9). B2 also surrendered another SIM card marked as “SK-SIM4”. B2 admitted that the said handphone and all four SIM cards belonged to him.

42     At about 5.44pm on the same day, SSgt Sunny Chien lodged a police report (A/20141126/2134) on B1’s arrest, and the seizure of the phone and four SIM cards (marked as P11).

43      Results of the analysis of A1A1 by the Health Sciences Authority. On 25 November 2014, IO Angus submitted the exhibit marked as A1A1 (P2) to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (“the HSA”) for analysis.

44     On 10 March 2015, Lim Jong Lee Wendy, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued the following certificate bearing Lab No ID-1432-02126-001 under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”) (marked as P12) stating that the exhibit marked “A1A1” was found to be one block containing the following:

> (a)     Not less than 402.7 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabis (as defined under s 2 of the MDA), and

> (b)     Not less than 541.2 grams of fragmented vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol, which was therefore cannabis mixture (as defined in s 2 of the MDA).

45     Cannabis, cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol (a cannabinol derivative) are Class A Controlled Drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

46     Both B1 and B2 are not authorised to possess or import cannabis, cannabinol and tetrahydrocannabinol (a cannabinol derivative) under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

47      Phone screening reports. In the course of investigations, the police requested for Starhub Subscriber Toll Records for P13 and P14.

48     The handphone AI-HP1 was sent to the Forensic Response Team (“FORT”) of the CNB for analysis. A report was prepared by the FORT officer, SSSgt Muhammad Nizam bin Abudol Ramin (FORT/MF12014/0248) (marked as P15).

49     In the course of investigations, HTS Toh Sin Ee took 63 photographs of the scene, the car, and the exhibits (marked as P16).

50     The travel movement records of B1 are marked as P17**.**

51     The documents and exhibits marked P1- P17 (see Annex A of the Statement of Agreed Facts) are not disputed and agreed by parties to be marked and admitted into evidence.

## Prosecution’s case

52     B1 and B2 had an agreement, _viz._ B1 would import the cannabis into Singapore and deliver them to B2. In other words, there was a conspiracy between them to import the cannabis.

53     B1 was presumed under s 21 of the MDA to have had the drugs in his possession. B1 had not rebutted the s 21 presumption of possession. The drugs were deemed to be in B2’s possession under s 18(4) of the MDA.

54     Since B1 and B2 were presumed and deemed respectively to have had the drugs in their possession, the s 18(2) presumption was invoked for both of them, that is, they were presumed to have known the nature of the drugs, i.e. the specific controlled drugs found in their possession (_viz._ cannabis). Both B1 and B2 had not successfully rebutted the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge.

55     Both B1 and B2 also had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (_viz._ cannabis).[^1]

## Defence’s case

### B1: Mr Adaikalaraj a/l Iruthayam

56     B1 intimated that he lacked actual knowledge and could not reasonably be expected to know that the red plastic bag in the motorcar contained cannabis.[^2] B1 said that he had been advised to place the red plastic bag in the motorcar’s bonnet to avoid paying tax,[^3] and that he did not check the contents of the red plastic bag as he was hurrying to collect his salary.[^4] B1 also said that he did not borrow any money from B2.[^5]

57     B1 challenged the voluntariness of his 5 Long Statements.[^6]

### B2: Mr Suresh s/o Krishnan

58     B2 said that B1 was merely returning money which he had borrowed from B2.[^7] B2 also said that he had liaised with B1 to purchase illegal cigarettes and not drugs.[^8]

## Issues to be determined

59     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     whether the s 21 MDA Presumption was invoked (‘Issue 1’);

> (b)     whether s 18(4) MDA was invoked (‘Issue 2’);

> (c)     whether the s 18(2) MDA presumption was invoked (‘Issue 3’); and

> (d)     if ‘yes’, whether the Accused Persons had rebutted the presumptions on a balance of probabilities (‘Issue 4’).

60     Briefly, my answers were ‘Yes’ to Issues 1 to 3, and ‘No’ to Issue 4.

## Issue 1: Whether s 21 MDA presumption was invoked

61     Section 21 of the MDA reads:

> If any controlled drug is found in any vehicle, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be in the **_possession_** of the owner of the vehicle and of the **_person in charge of the vehicle_** for the time being. \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

62     It was not disputed that the drugs were found inside a Malaysian-registered motorcar with registration no. WGN 4531 (‘motorcar’) on 22 November 2014 (see also _Mohamed Affandi Bin Rosli v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 440</span>). As B1 was in charge of the motorcar at the relevant time, this invoked for him the presumption under s 21 of the MDA.

## Issue 2: Whether s 18(4) MDA was invoked

63     Section 18(4) of the MDA reads:

> Where one of 2 or more persons with the **_knowledge and consent of the rest_** has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the **_possession_** of each and all of them. \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

(see _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh_ at \[49\]-\[70\], and _Public Prosecutor v Aishamudin bin Jamaludin_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 8</span> at \[13\]-\[20\]; see also Michael Hor, _Co-Accused Confessions: The Third Anniversary_, 8 SAcLJ 327)

64     Section 18(4) is not a presumption. Instead, it is a definitional and deeming provision: _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh_ at \[51\] and \[64\].

65     Since B1 was presumed under s 21 of the MDA to have had the drugs in his possession, if B1 did so with the ‘knowledge and consent’ of B2, the drugs shall be deemed to be in B2’s possession.

66     What amounts to ‘knowledge and consent’? In _Public Prosecutor v Lim Ah Poh & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 2 SLR(R) 307</span> at \[71\], the High Court held that:

> ‘Acquiescence or condonation is not enough. There **_must be some dealing_** between the parties in relation to the _drug_, such as **_an agreement to buy it_**, or help in concealing it.’ \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

67     This definition was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh_ at \[52\] and \[66\], and _Hartej Sidhu and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 2 SLR(R) 541</span> at \[38\]. In _Hartej Sidhu_ at \[4\], the first appellant – who was carrying the drugs – was arrested in the coffee house, while the second appellant was arrested at a separate location (hotel lobby).

68     Whether there is ‘knowledge and consent’ is a question of fact. The offender has to exercise some measure of control over the drugs being deemed to be in his possession, and ‘control’ here refers to the offender’s power or authority over the drugs in question (not physical control): _Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali v Public Prosecutor and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 721</span> at \[63\]-\[65\], and _Public Prosecutor v Zulkarnain bin Kemat & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 161</span> at \[85\].

69     The touchstone of joint possession under s 18(4) is not a physical connection (involving physical possession, custody or control) between the accused person and the thing, but rather the accused person’s _consent_ to _another_ person being in actual possession of the thing: _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh_ at \[63\] and \[67\].

70     The ‘knowledge’ in s 18(4) refers to the knowledge that the object in the actual possessor’s possession is a controlled drug in general (as opposed to any specific controlled drug): _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh_ at \[55\], \[66\] and \[70\].

71     In the present case, B1 had drugs in his possession with B2’s ‘knowledge and consent’ because:

> (a)     B2 had ordered the ‘ganja’ via B1 through SMSes and telephone calls on 21 November 2014.[^9] On the evidence before me, I did not agree with B1 that someone else had used his handphone to make telephone calls and send SMSes.[^10]

> (b)     B2 had transferred $1000 to B1 beforehand on 22 November 2014, for B1 to obtain this ‘ganja’.[^11]

> (c)     On 22 November 2014, B1 was going to Hougang to deliver the cannabis to B2.[^12]

> (d)     B2 told B1 where to deliver the drugs during a telephone conversation:[^13] SI Samir bin Haroon’s written record of the telephone conversations between B1 and B2 in a contemporaneous document titled ‘Communication Transcript of Accused’.[^14]

> (e)     B2 also told B1 that ‘he feels uneasy, and told B1 not to come to Hougang, and to wait for his phonecall’.[^15]

72     B2’s control over B1’s conduct before and during the drug transaction was clear. B2 knew that the object in B1’s possession is a controlled drug in general. In the premises, the drugs were deemed to be in B2’s possession (see Michael Hor, _Misuse of Drugs and Aberrations in the Criminal Law_, <span class="citation">(2001) 13 SAcLJ 54</span> at footnote 114, and at 1(g) – Drugs and the Strictness of Liability).

73      **Knowledge in the Importation Offence**. I turn next to the element of knowledge in the offence of importation. For knowledge as to the nature of the drugs, the Prosecution may choose to prove that the Accused Persons had _actual knowledge_ of the specific nature of the drug (see also _Obeng Comfort v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 12</span> at \[41\], _viz._ in such a case, the presumption is still operable even though it need not be invoked).

74     Available to the Prosecution as an indirect way to prove ‘the legal equivalent of actual knowledge’ is to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused Persons were _wilfully blind_: _Adili Chibuike Ejike_ at \[41\]-\[62\] and \[93\]-\[101\] (see Rennie Whang, _The Doctrine of Wilful Blindness in Drug Offences: Adili Chibuike Ejike_, <span class="citation">(2020) 32 SAcLJ 305</span> at \[3\], \[10\]-\[14\] and \[27\]-\[29\]).

75     The threshold to establish wilful blindness is a high one (_Public Prosecutor v Mohsen Bin Na’im_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 150</span> at \[118\]; see also Benny Tan, _Wilful Blindness and Presumption of Knowledge under Section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act – Putting the Puzzle Pieces Together_, Law Gazette (February 2016) at 38-39).

76     Negligence or recklessness will not suffice: _Public Prosecutor v Masoud Rahimi Bin Mehrzad_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 257</span> at \[55\] (see Michael Hor, _Criminal Justice in the Chan Court: Change, Contestation and Conservatism in the Court of Appeal_, SAL Conference 2011 – Singapore Law Developments (2006-2010), 2011 at \[14\]-\[39\]; see also Chan Wing Cheong, _Culpability in the Misuse of Drugs Act: Wilful Blindness, the Reasonable Person and a Duty to Check_, <span class="citation">(2013) 25 SAcLJ 110</span> at \[3\]-\[40\]).

77     Alternatively, the Prosecution may rely on the statutory presumption of such knowledge under s 18 of the MDA (_Public Prosecutor v Adili Chibuike Ejike_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 106</span> at \[27\]), which I turn to next.

## Issue 3: Whether s 18(2) MDA presumption was invoked

78     Section 18(2) of the MDA reads:

> Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have **_known_** the nature of that drug. \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

79     Physical possession of the drugs by an accused person was unnecessary for the presumption of knowledge to arise under s 18(2) of the MDA: _Muhammad Ridzuan bin Md Ali_ at \[74\].

80     Since B1 and B2 were presumed and deemed respectively to have had the drugs in their possession, the presumption under s 18(2) of the MDA was invoked for both of them: _Zulkarnain bin Kemat_ at \[84\]-\[87\] and _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh_ at \[68\].

81     In other words, B1 and B2 were presumed to have known the nature of the drugs, _i.e._ the specific controlled drugs found in their possession (_viz._ cannabis): _Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1156</span> at \[23\]-\[24\] (see Chen Siyuan and Nathaniel Yong-Ern Khng, _Possession and Knowledge in the Misuse of Drugs Act: Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam_, \[2012\] 30 Singapore Law Review 181).

82     Once the presumptions are invoked, the burden shifts to B1 and B2 to rebut those presumptions on a balance of probabilities: _Public Prosecutor v Ilechukwu Chukwudi_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 33</span> at \[30\]. I segue to examine whether B1 and B2 had successfully rebutted those presumptions.

## Issue 4: Whether presumptions were rebutted on a balance of probabilities

83     In order to rebut the s 18(2) presumption, an accused has to adduce evidence to establish on a _balance of probabilities_ that he did not have knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug (i.e. there was no _mens rea_): _Obeng Comfort_ at \[36\]-\[37\] (see Michael Hor, _Managing Mens Rea in Singapore_, <span class="citation">(2006) 18 SAcLJ 314</span> at \[29\]-\[58\]; Michael Hor, _Misuse of Drugs and Aberrations in the Criminal Law_, <span class="citation">(2001) 13 SAcLJ 54</span> at 4(b) – Special ‘Complicity’ in the MDA: ‘Knowledge and Consent’).

84     An accused may rebut the s 18(2) presumption by showing, on a balance of probabilities, that he:

> (a)     Lacked actual knowledge of the nature of the controlled drug (‘Limb 1’), or

> (b)     Could not reasonably be expected to have known the nature of the controlled drug (Limb 2): _Sinnappan a/l Nadarajah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 21</span> at \[24\].

> (see Benny Tan, _Wilful Blindness and Presumption of Knowledge under Section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act – Putting the Puzzle Pieces Together_, Law Gazette (February 2016) at 41)

85     An accused will fail to rebut the s 18(2) presumption under Limb 2 on a balance of probabilities, if the court finds that he neglected or refused to take reasonable steps to find out what such contents were, in circumstances where a reasonable person having the suspicions that he had, would have taken steps to find out: _Mohsen Bin Na’im_ at \[115(b)(ii)\]. In short, he would be ‘_turning a blind eye_’.[^16]

86     As aforementioned, to rebut the s 18(2) presumption, an accused has to adduce evidence to establish on a balance of probabilities that he had not known the nature of the drugs. This can be in the form of proof that an accused genuinely believed that he was carrying something innocuous or that he was carrying a controlled drug other than the one found on him. Whether the presumption of knowledge has been rebutted is ultimately a fact-centric inquiry that is assessed on the specific facts of each case: _Masoud Rahimi Bin Mehrzad_ at \[55\].

87     Similarly, he would not be able to rebut the presumption as to knowledge by merely claiming that he did not know the proper name of the drug that he was asked to carry. The law also does not require him to know the drug’s effects or its scientific or chemical name: _Muhammad Farid bin Batra v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 19</span> at \[111\]-\[112\] (see Leong Hoi Seng Victor, _Three Observations Arising from the Court of Appeal’s Decision in PP v Gobi A/L Avedian_, Law Gazette (February 2019; second observation)).

88     Where an accused has stated what he thought he was carrying (‘purported item’), the court will assess the veracity of his assertion against the objective facts and examine his actions relating to the purported item: _Obeng Comfort_ at \[40\] and _Public Prosecutor v Gobi a/l Avedian_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 145</span> at \[34\]-\[54\].

89     I was aware of the inherent difficulties of proving a negative, and the burden on the Accused Persons faced with this task should not be made so onerous that it becomes virtually impossible to discharge: Court of Appeal in _Harven a/l Segar v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 771</span> at \[2\] and _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 25</span> at \[92\].

90     I was also mindful that although the Prosecution has a statutory presumption operating in its favour, when it comes to assessing the evidence to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted, the starting point should be neutral with no predilection for either conclusion. The real significance of the statutory presumption is that it reverses the burden of proof. But once the evidence has been led, it must be evaluated neutrally to determine whether the presumption has been rebutted: _Gopu Jaya Raman v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 499</span> at \[25\].

91      **B1**. In the present case, the drugs were found on top of the battery in the motorcar’s bonnet.[^17] The drugs were in clear cling wrap – haphazardly wrapped in newspaper[^18] – and placed in a red plastic bag.[^19] During the trial, B1 intimated that he lacked actual knowledge and could not reasonably be expected to know that the red plastic bag in the motorcar contained cannabis.[^20] I did not accept B1’s claim for the following reasons.

92     First, it would not suffice for B1 to claim simply that he did not know what he was carrying save that he did not know or think it was drugs: _Obeng Comfort_ at \[39\].

93     Second, B1 testified that even before the officers found the packet in the motorcar’s bonnet, B1 had known about the packet’s location which caused him to feel ‘strange’.[^21] This gave me pause as it was B1 who had placed the red plastic bag inside the motorcar’s bonnet and ‘tied the handles of the red plastic bag at the metal rod which was holding on(to) the battery of the car’.[^22]

94     Even if someone else (e.g. Kesavan or Karthik) had asked B1 to conceal that red plastic bag inside the motorcar’s bonnet, B1 should have found this to be highly suspicious and enquire further.[^23] This is especially since B1 admitted that he did not trust them,[^24] coupled with the fact that B1 had only met them for the first time less than 2 months before being arrested.[^25]

95     B1’s case is analogous to _Norasharee bin Gous v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 820</span>. In _Norasharee_, an allegation of trust being reposed by the accused was rejected by the Court of Appeal as the object of that trust was involved in ‘a spectrum of illegal activities’, had previously threatened to beat the accused, and had shown himself to be ‘untrustworthy’ (at \[50\]).

96     In our present case, B1’s alleged failure to check the contents of the red plastic bag was inexplicable. There was nothing to support the passive posture purportedly taken by B1 – all the circumstances pointed against the reposing of trust, and therefore active steps should have been taken by him to check the contents of the red plastic bag. If B1 did not check, despite these circumstances, this militated in favour of rejecting his version (see _Public Prosecutor v Saravanan Chandaram_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 262</span> at \[49\]).

97     I did not accept B1’s bare assertions that (i) he had been advised to place the red plastic bag in the motorcar’s bonnet to avoid paying tax,[^26] and that (ii) he did not check the contents of the red plastic bag as he was hurrying to collect his salary.[^27] B1, in the same breath, had testified that it was ‘only when (he) was transferring (the red plastic bag) from the car to the front bonnet, (he) may--- (he) _coincidentally saw what was inside_. And when (he) was tying it to the metal rod, (he) _could see what was inside_.’[^28] It would merely have taken a few seconds to examine the contents of something ‘haphazardly wrapped in newspaper’.[^29]

98     Furthermore, B1 specifically bought the motorcar one day before delivering the drugs to B2,[^30] even though he had previously travelled to Singapore on a motorcycle.[^31] B1 explained that his ‘intention was to use the car for delivering drugs to Singapore as (he) did not want to use (his) own family car’.[^32] B1 also took the motorcar to a workshop to repair a window, as he ‘did not want to draw the attention of the Customs officers unnecessarily as (he) cleared the Customs’.[^33]

99     At the Woodlands Checkpoint, a tiny hole was made on the red plastic bag and newspaper, revealing a vegetable substance.[^34] Upon seeing this, B1 claimed that ‘he doesn’t know’[^35] and ‘the car had just come up from the workshop’[^36].[^37] While SSgt Jagan s/o Ganasekaran observed that B1 was nervous and scared during the incident,[^38] B1 looked normal, not panicky, calm and collected to other officers.[^39]

100    That said, at Woodlands Checkpoint, B1 informed SSgt Jagan in Tamil that he was supposed to pass ‘Jama’ to one ‘Suresh’.[^40] The literal meaning of the Tamil word ‘Jama’ is ‘thing’, but based on SSgt Jagan’s CNB experience, it also means ‘drugs’ amongst couriers (see, for example, _Public Prosecutor v Zainudin bin Mohamed and another_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 245</span>).[^41]

101    In this regard, B1 had indicated to SSgt Jagan that the item seized from the motorcar’s bonnet[^42] – _viz._ a hole had been made on the red plastic bag and newspaper, revealing a vegetable substance – was ‘Jama’.[^43] During a telephone conversation, B2 told B1 where to deliver the ‘Jama’.[^44] SI Samir bin Haroon recorded the telephone conversations in a contemporaneous document titled ‘Communication Transcript of Accused’:[^45]

102    During the telephone conversations, at B1’s own request, the vehicle’s engine was switched on and they tuned in to a Tamil-speaking radio station to simulate an environment where B1 was driving.[^47] In relation to the telephone records, both Starhub officers[^48] testified that there was no service shortage or error during the relevant period.[^49]

103    In sum, the evidence against B1 was as follows:

> (a)     At Woodlands Checkpoint, B1 informed SSgt Jagan in Tamil that he was supposed to pass ‘Jama’ to one ‘Suresh’.[^50] B1 had indicated that the item seized from the motorcar – _viz._ a hole had been made on the red plastic bag and newspaper, revealing a vegetable substance – was ‘Jama’.[^51]

> (b)     B1’s telephone conversations with B2, the contents of which were summarised in the contemporaneous document titled ‘Communication Transcript of Accused’.[^52]

> (c)     B1’s 5 positive Long Statements, which were admitted after an ancillary hearing. In these Long Statements, B1 admitted that:

>> (i)       Before his arrest, B1 knew that he was bringing one block of ‘ganja’ to B2.[^53]

>> (ii)       In this regard, B1 had put his ‘hand inside the plastic bag to unfold the newspapers to take a peep inside. (B1) saw brown dried leaves and upon seeing it, (B1) knew it is ‘ganja’’.[^54]

104    In my judgment, B1 had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (_viz._ cannabis). In any event, B1 had not rebutted the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge. B1 had also not rebutted the s 21 presumption of possession.

105     **B2**. For B2, he claimed to have told B1 over the telephone on 22 November 2014 to deliver money, _viz._ ‘kesa’ in Tamil.[^55] B2’s defence is that B1 was returning money which he had borrowed from B2.[^56]

106    However, SI Samir bin Haroon[^57] testified that money was _not_ mentioned during the telephone conversations.[^58] Also present in the CNB vehicle was Corporal Vengedesh Raj[^59] who understands Tamil.[^60] B2 had told B1 where to deliver the _drugs_ during the telephone conversation.[^61] B2 had ordered the ‘ganja’ via B1 through SMSes and telephone calls on 21 November 2014.[^62]

107    Moreover, it would have been odd for B2 to ask B1 to pay back a loan by placing the money ‘at the third floor landing at the bicycle’, instead of having B1 hand the money personally to B2.[^63]

108    In any case, B1 avowed that he did _not_ borrow any money from B2.[^64] This coheres with the fact that B2 failed to mention about loans in his Long Statement.[^65] And it is difficult to believe B2’s version that he had lent S$1800 to B1 – whom he did not know well and had only met less than 2 months ago[^66] – when B2 only had a total of about S$5000.[^67]

109    B2 also said that he had liaised with B1 to purchase illegal cigarettes and not drugs.[^68] B2 finessed this point by referring to B1’s SMS emphasising the weight of the items: ‘Bro u want or don’t want. Cos u side corkup and my side ready but can’t take. _The think heavy bro_. Cal me’ \[emphasis added in italics\].[^69]

110    However, I did not accept that B2 had ordered illegal cigarettes (instead of drugs) from B1. This is because B1 maintained that he had never dealt in cigarettes with B2.[^70] No illegal cigarettes were found in B1’s motorcar or B2’s home.[^71]

111    Furthermore, I observed that B2’s SMS[^72] used the word ‘carton’, while his Long Statement[^73] repeatedly used the word ‘box’. Given that a box contains 50 cartons of cigarettes (as agreed between the Prosecution and B2),[^74] it is unlikely that a person steeped in dealing with contraband cigarettes would muddle up the two words.[^75]

112    The reality is that in his SMS to B1, B2 was referring not to one carton of cigarettes but to drugs.[^76] And my view is fortified by the fact that within half an hour of receiving B2’s SMS confirming the purchase of ‘1 carton’, B1 ordered ‘1 cake’ from his suppliers;[^77] ‘cake’ is a term used not for cigarettes[^78] but for drugs.[^79] On 19 November 2014, B1 had also sent B2 an SMS as follows: ‘Cal me bro. I at SG. _Ur cake_ wit me …’.[^80]

113    In the circumstances, given the fact that B1’s Long Statements incriminated B2, B2 had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (_viz._ cannabis). In any event, B2 had not rebutted the s 18(2) presumption of knowledge.

114    For the above reasons, B1 and B2 had an agreement, _viz._ B1 would import the drugs into Singapore and deliver them to B2. In short, there was a conspiracy between them to import the drugs, based on:

> (a)     The SMSes and telephone calls between them,

> (b)     The ‘Communication Transcript of Accused’,[^81]

> (c)     The bank records, including the fact that B2 had transferred $1000 to B1 beforehand on 22 November 2014, for B1 to obtain the ‘ganja’,[^82]

> (d)     B1’s 5 positive Long Statements, and

> (e)     The fact that B1 was going to Hougang on 22 November 2014 to deliver the cannabis to B2.[^83]

115    In sum, with respect, B2’s claims did not lie within the pale of logic and were implausible (_Public Prosecutor v Wee Teong Boo_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 56</span> at \[53\]-\[54\], \[60\], \[71\], \[81\] and \[120\]). Both Accused Persons were also not authorised under the MDA or its Regulations to import cannabis into Singapore.

## Ancillary hearing

116     Challenging the Long Statements’ Voluntariness. B1 challenged the voluntariness of 5 Long Statements[^84] recorded by ASP Xie Junhao.[^85] An ancillary hearing was held.

117     The Law for Ancillary Hearings. Where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily and not on the Defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the statements were not made voluntarily: _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span> at \[177\], and _Azman bin Mohamed Sanwan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 733</span> at \[19\]-\[27\] (see also Ho Hock Lai, _On the Obtaining and Admissibility of Incriminating Statements_, SJLS \[2016\] 249 at 253-255 and 260-261, and Chen Siyuan and Nicholas Poon, _The Inadmissibility of Unreliable Self-Inculpatory Statements_, Singapore Law Watch (Issue 4/ March 2012)).

118    It is only necessary for the Prosecution to remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear: _Panya Martmontree v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 806</span> at \[32\] (see also Chin Tet Yung, _Criminal Procedure Code 2010: Confessions and Statements by Accused Persons Revisited_, <span class="citation">(2012) 24 SAcLJ 60</span> at \[16\]-\[33\] and \[52\]-\[53\]).

119    The voluntariness test is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise. The subjective limb is satisfied when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the offender’s mind through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge: _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[53\] (see also Dorcas Quek, _The Concept of Voluntariness in the Law of Confessions_, <span class="citation">(2005) 17 SAcLJ 819</span> at \[35\]).

120     Allegations. In the present case, the Defence levelled the following allegations against the recorder of B1’s 5 Long Statements (_viz._ ASP Xie Junhao):[^86]

> (a)     Before recording the Long Statements, ASP Xie threatened B1 through the interpreter that he had better come clean as the drugs were more than 1kg of ‘ganja’, which triggered the death penalty.[^87]

> (b)     ASP Xie promised B1 through the interpreter, that if B1 cooperated during the statement-recording:

>> (i)       For a capital charge, the authorities would ask for life imprisonment instead of the death penalty.[^88]

>> (ii)       In the event that the drugs weighed less than 500 grams, the authorities would ask for a 10-year sentence.[^89]

>> (iii)       B1 would be allowed to contact his family by telephone.[^90]

121    After the ancillary hearing, I found that the 5 Long Statements were voluntarily given, and admitted them into evidence. My reasons are as follows.

122    First, ASP Xie denied the allegations.[^91] Second, ASP Xie’s evidence was corroborated by an independent party – the interpreter, Madam Malliga Awandha Krishnan.[^92] She was the interpreter for all 5 Long Statements. Madam Malliga testified that the allegations did not take place. She explained that the alleged events were very unusual and she would remember them if they had occurred, particularly since they supposedly occurred on many occasions over several days.[^93]

123    Madam Malliga was not cross-examined about B1 being promised that he can contact his family by telephone if he cooperated during the statement-recording:[^94] rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67 as analysed in the Court of Appeal cases of _Harven a/l Segar_ at \[66\] and _Asnah Bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 16</span> at \[115\] (see _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_ at \[55\] regarding being able to contact one’s spouse by telephone; see also Jeffrey Pinsler, _Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 2013), at \[20.96\]).

124    Third, B1 only raised the allegations during trial, two years after his arrest. Tellingly, none of these allegations were found in the Case for the Defence;[^95] in fact, defence counsel did not indicate therein that B1 was challenging the Long Statements’ voluntariness.[^96] In the premises, the allegations were after-thoughts.

125    B1 claimed that it was SSgt Jagan who had informed him that what B1 had brought into Singapore were drugs (_viz._ cannabis), which attracted the death penalty.[^97] But SSgt Jagan disagreed with B1’s claim, and he was called as a rebuttal witness (see _Public Prosecutor v Chan Lie Sian_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 205</span> at \[36\]-\[37\]; see also the _Practitioners’ Library: Evidence in Criminal Trials_ (LexisNexis, Subordinate Courts of Singapore, 2002), 25 – Rebuttal Evidence).[^98]

126    I accepted the evidence of SSgt Jagan, ASP Xie, and Madam Malliga, which I found to be consistent and credible. There was no one else in the interview room during the recording of the statements.[^99]

127    In sum, I found that B1’s 5 Long Statements were voluntarily given, and admitted them into evidence. I was mindful that a trial judge has a discretion, and indeed a duty, throughout the trial to reconsider his decision to admit statements given by an accused person if further evidence emerges that raises doubt about their admissibility: ss 279(7) and 279(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (see _Public Prosecutor v Tan Lye Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 564</span> at \[2\] and \[24\]-\[36\]).

128    It is settled law that an accused person can be convicted on his own confessions, even if they were retracted, if the court is satisfied that they were made voluntarily and that they are true, and there is no need for corroborative evidence to support them: Court of Appeal in _Thongthot Yordsa-Art and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 412</span> at \[22\], and _Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek & Anor v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 1166</span> at \[20\] to \[23\].

129    In the present case, B1 was read back his Long Statements by the interpreter and was invited to amend any part of his printed statements before acknowledging that they were correct.[^100] In this regard, B1 amended his Long Statement at \[7\].[^101] B1’s exculpatory version of the facts at the trial was not found in his Long Statements (see, for example, _Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek & Anor_ at \[23\]).

130    Once the statements are admitted, the next task is to identify the relevant admissions contained in them that support the elements of the charge: _Tan Lye Heng_ at \[70\].

131    B1’s Long Statements contain the word ‘ganja’. ASP Xie testified that he had not asked B1 specific questions on the drug exhibit, and the word ‘ganja’ originated from B1.[^102] This explained why inverted commas were placed around the word ‘ganja’, which means cannabis.[^103] ASP Xie stated that B1 had said that he was delivering ‘ganja’, which B1 confirmed to be Exhibit A1A1 as shown in Exhibit P16-42.[^104] I accepted ASP Xie’s evidence.

132    I gave full weight to B1’s 5 Long Statements, where B1 admitted to the following:

> (a)     He committed the drug offence due to his debts of RM$33,000.[^105]

> (b)     Before his arrest, B1 knew that he was bringing one block of ‘ganja’ to B2.[^106]

> (c)     In this regard, B1 had put his ‘hand inside the plastic bag to unfold the newspapers to take a peep inside. (B1) saw brown dried leaves and upon seeing it, (B1) knew it is ‘ganja’’.[^107]

> (d)     B1 placed the red plastic bag inside the motorcar’s bonnet and ‘tied the handles of the red plastic bag at the metal rod which was holding on(to) the battery of the car’.[^108] B1 drove the motorcar into Singapore’s Woodlands Checkpoint at about 12.40 p.m. on 22 November 2014.[^109]

> (e)     B1 had obtained this ‘ganja’ using the S$1000 that B2 had transferred to him beforehand on 22 November 2014.[^110] This transfer of S$1000 is borne out by documentary evidence.[^111]

> (f)     B2 had ordered the ‘ganja’ via B1 through SMSes and telephone calls on 21 November 2014.[^112]

> (see, for example, Chin Tet Yung, _Criminal Procedure Code 2010: Confessions and Statements by Accused Persons Revisited_, <span class="citation">(2012) 24 SAcLJ 60</span> at \[53\])

133    My view was fortified by B1’s Case for the Defence[^113] which reads:

> 1\. **_Adaikalaraj a/l Iruthayam (Adaikalaraj) has knowledge of the substances_** inside the clear plastic wraps wrapped with newspaper inside a red plastic bag tied by the plastic bag handles to the metal rod holding the car battery inside the bonnet but he has no knowledge of the weight of the substance inside the red plastic bag… \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

## B1’s statements incriminated B2

134    An accused’s conviction can be sustained solely on the basis of a co-accused’s confession if the confession establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty: _Thongthot Yordsa-Art_ at \[23\], and _Norasharee bin Gous_ at \[54\]-\[60\] (see Michael Hor, _Co-Accused Confessions: The Third Anniversary_, 8 SAcLJ 323-342, and Chen Siyuan and Eunice Chua, _2018 Changes to the Evidence Act and Criminal Procedure Code: The Criminal Justice Reform Bill and Evidence (Amendment) Bill_, <span class="citation">(2018) 30 SAcLJ 1064</span> at \[3\]-\[15\]). This is a well-grooved area.

135    To be sure, illustration (b) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997) states that

> the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with caution.

136    However, this presumption is not mandatory but permissive or discretionary and depends on all the circumstances: _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_ at \[61\].[^114] The presumption must be read with s 135(2) of the Evidence Act which provides that ‘any rule of law or practice whereby at a trial it is obligatory for the court to warn itself about convicting the accused on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is hereby abrogated’.

137    The Court of Appeal, in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin_, held that whether or not the court should believe the accomplice’s evidence would depend on all the circumstances of the case and the evidence must be tested against the objective facts as well as the inherent probabilities and improbabilities. Where the court did not discern any attempt by the accomplice materially to minimize his own involvement or exaggerate that of the accused, and his evidence was found to be consistent as a whole and reliable on a review of the whole evidence, there was no reason why the evidence should be treated as unreliable.[^115]

138    I was satisfied that this was the case for B1’s statements on our present facts.

139    For completeness, it bears reiteration that there is no absolute prohibition or legal impediment in convicting an accused on the evidence of a single witness (_viz._ accomplice or interested witness): _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[44\].

140    I was mindful of the inherent dangers of such a conviction and subjected the evidence at hand to close scrutiny. In such situations, a conviction can only be upheld if the testimony is so compelling to the extent that a conviction can be founded entirely and exclusively on it. That means no more than that the witness’s testimony evidence is so compelling that solely on the basis of that witness’s testimony, the Prosecution’s case is proved beyond reasonable doubt: _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ at \[45\].

141    A reasonable doubt is a reasoned doubt, and is a necessary condition for an acquittal: _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> at \[127\]-\[128\] and \[149(b)-(h)\], and reaffirmed in _Han Fang Guan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 649</span> at \[36\].

142    In the present case, I found that B1’s statements – which incriminated B2 – were so compelling that the Prosecution had proved the charge against B2 beyond reasonable doubt based on B1’s evidence alone. B1’s statements can be used against B2 under s 258(5) of the CPC.[^116]

143    Section 258(5) of the CPC reads:

> When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration the confession as against the other person as well as against the person who makes the confession.

144    The Explanation to s 258(5) reads:

> ‘Offence’ as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.

(see _Chin Seow Noi and others v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 3 SLR(R) 566</span> at \[84\], and _Ramesh A/L Perumal v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 1003</span> at \[60\]-\[62\]; see also Jennifer Marie and Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir, _The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations and Commentary_ (Academy Publishing, 2012) at \[14.035\]-\[14.037\])

145    I gave full weight to B1’s statements.

146    In this connection, B1’s statements revealed that:

> (a)     B2 had ordered the ‘ganja’ via B1 through SMSes and telephone calls on 21 November 2014.[^117]

> (b)     B2 had transferred $1000 to B1 beforehand on 22 November 2014, for B1 to obtain this ‘ganja’.[^118]

> (c)     On 22 November 2014, B1 was going to Hougang to deliver the cannabis to B2.[^119] Both B1 and B2 knew that it was ‘ganja’.[^120]

147    B1’s delivery of the drugs bore the imprimatur of B2. This is undergirded by SI Samir bin Haroon’s written record of the telephone conversations between B1 and B2 in a contemporaneous document titled ‘Communication Transcript of Accused’ whereby:[^121]

> (a)     B2 told B1 where to deliver the drugs during the telephone conversation;[^122] and

> (b)     B2 called B1 and told B1 that ‘he feels uneasy, and told B1 not to come to Hougang, and to wait for his phonecall’.[^123]

148    Finally, B1’s Case for the Defence[^124] stated as follows:

> ‘2. The package was given to Adaikalaraj in Johor Bahru **_to be delivered to one Suresh in Singapore. Suresh ordered the substance through his contact in Johor Bahru_**. His job only to deliver.’ \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

149    In court, B1 maintained that it was B2 who had asked for the parcel to be delivered to B2.

150    For completeness, I observed that the contents of B1’s statements were consistent with other documentary evidence such as his travel movement records[^125] provided by the ICA and the summary of the tele-communications records.[^126] In this connection, two examples will suffice:

> (a)     ICA’s travel movement records[^127] showed that B1 entered Singapore on 19 November 2014 at 1.09 p.m. This is consistent with B1’s SMS to B2 at 1.25 p.m.: ‘Cal me bro. I at SG. Ur cake wit me …’.[^128] This in turn cohered with B1’s Long Statement[^129] at \[23\]: ‘In the afternoon, I then subsequently delivered the block of “ganja” using my Malaysian motorcycle, JDD5193 to “Suresh”’; and

> (b)     On 19 November 2014 at 2.28 p.m., B1 sent B2 a SMS: ‘Bro I at ur place call me pls’.[^130] This was consistent with B1’s Long Statement[^131] at \[23\]: ‘At about 2.30p.m., I then went to Blk 526 Hougang and placed the block of “ganja” at the pipes at the second floor staircase upon “Suresh’s” instructions. After placing, I then call “Suresh” and informed him that I had already placed the block of “ganja” at the pipes at second floor staircase’.

151    This dovetailed with the fact that B1 made several phone calls to B2 between 2.29 p.m. and 2.41p.m.,[^132] and also accorded with B1 departing Singapore on 19 November 2014 at 3.13 p.m. per ICA’s travel movement records.[^133]

152    B1 was the only person who used the SIM cards in his handphone.[^134]

153    In sum, the Prosecution navigated the shoals of denials by B2.

154    To avoid any doubt, I was mindful that in joint trials, findings in favour of one accused person may implicitly amount to findings in favour of the Prosecution where its case against the other accused persons was concerned. Trial courts must exercise great care in making such findings. I was aware that it should always be borne in mind that the Prosecution bears the burden of proving the guilt of _each_ accused person beyond reasonable doubt: _Mui Jia Jun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 1087</span> at \[70\].

155    I was also mindful that these principles are of especial importance for charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act. I was aware that courts must guard against the mind-set that once an unbelievable defence is rejected, everything is to be taken _against_ the accused. This might lead a court, inadvertently, to fill certain gaps in the evidence in order to support a finding against the accused, when it is rightly the Prosecution which bears the burden of filling such evidential gaps, failing which a conviction cannot be sustained: _Ramesh A/L Perumal_ at \[2\].

156    It is for the Prosecution, and not the court, to fill in any gaps in the Prosecution’s case. This is not least because while the Prosecution is charged with a number of significant burdens (such as having to prove its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt), it has access to the police, the investigating authorities, as well as witnesses and their statements, and is also armed with and assisted by various tools (such as statutory presumptions): _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad_ at \[171\]-\[172\].

## Application to recall a witness

157    After B2’s arrest, his defence counsel applied to recall B1 for further cross-examination.

158    Section 283(1) and (2) of the CPC reads:

> (1) A court may, on its own motion or on the application of the prosecution or the defence, at the close of the case for the defence, or at the end of any proceeding under this Code, summon a person as a witness or examine a person in attendance as a witness, whether or not summoned, or recall and re-examine a person already examined.

> (2) The court must summon and examine or recall and re-examine such a person if it thinks his **_evidence is essential to making a just decision_** in the case. \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

159    Section 283(1) of the CPC confers a discretionary power on the trial judge, while s 283(2) mandates his exercise of the power to summon or recall a witness if his evidence is essential to the justice of the case: _Azman bin Jamaludin v Public Prosecutor_ \[2012\] 1 SLR 250 at \[13\] and \[25\] (see Jennifer Marie and Mohamed Faizal Mohamed Abdul Kadir, _The Criminal Procedure Code of Singapore: Annotations and Commentary_ (Academy Publishing, 2012) at \[14.232\]; see also s 140(4) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed)).[^135]

160    The guiding principle for the court is to reach a just decision, and to seek the truth from the facts to avoid a miscarriage of justice: _Azman bin Jamaludin_ at \[35\].

161    Whether or not s 283 of the CPC justified the recalling of a witness would depend on the facts of each case: _Soh Tian Khoon Raymond v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 1410</span> at \[15\]-\[16\] (see also Tan Yock Lin and S. Chandra Mohan, _Criminal Procedure_ (LexisNexis: 2019; Binder 2, Chapter XV: Course of Trial) at \[4355\] to \[5650\], in particular, \[5402\], \[5451\] and \[5452\]).

162    In the present case, B2’s defence counsel applied to recall B1 for further cross-examination for the following reasons: B2 “being in person, and his inability to conduct a cross-examination without counsel”.[^136] Essentially, it was submitted that B2’s cross-examination had been forged on the anvil of being unrepresented. As against this, the Prosecution urged the court to disallow the application to recall B1 for further cross-examination.[^137]

163    After considering both sides’ written submissions and oral replies, I agreed with the Prosecution for the following reasons.

164    First, B2 had already cross-examined B1 during the trial, and put his case clearly to B1 (_viz_. B1 was returning money to B2).[^138] In this regard, B2 had asked B1 the following questions:

> (a)     “On the day, you were supposed to come and pass me money which I transferred you where I cancelled my cigarette order.[^139] 10.30 to 11.00 when I made the first call to you in the morning, I asked you to refund back my money because it was my own personal money. And I’m sure you are lying and you just---when you are caught, you just **_frame me_** up like that. You got anything to say about it?”[^140]

> (b)     “Mr Adaikalaraj, on the 22nd, **_you supposed to come and pass me money, not anything else_**_._ Just because you got caught for something, which you are---you face the death penalty at that moment, you shouldn’t just anyhow say anything like that.”[^141]

> (c)     “On the day of your arrest in the morning when I called you, I asked you for the **_money to return it back to me_**.”[^142]

> (d)     “Mr Adaikalaraj, you are lying. **_You borrowed money_** from me saying that you need to pay your car and you only dealt with me for cigarettes.”[^143]

> (e)     “And do you remember that you **_borrowed_** 1,000 from me to pay your car?”[^144] \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

165    B2 had also put it to B1 that B2 had only bought cigarettes (not drugs) from him:[^145]

> (a)     “Raj, **I only know you through this cigarette deal**… If you have no personal deal---**cigarette deals** with me, how would you say about the messages?”[^146]

> (b)     “Mr Adaikalaraj, you are lying. You borrowed money from me saying that you need to pay your car and **you only dealt with me for cigarettes**.”[^147]

> (c)     “Mr Adaikalaraj, I want to tell you that you are lying in this Court. You know me and you know that **I only dealt with cigarettes** and you borrowed money from me. And I don’t know why you are changing here and there every moment and you put me into trouble for nothing.”[^148]

> (d)     “Mr Adaikalaraj, I want to tell you that **when I bought cigarettes from you**, I used to pass you cash. Do you agree to it?”[^149] \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

166    During the trial, the Court had explained to B2 the importance of putting his case to B1[^150] and challenging the portions of B1’s evidence which he disagreed with.[^151] B2 appreciated the nature of his charges and their consequences. He is proficient in English and did not need an interpreter.[^152] In so far as the Defence intimated that B2 had a fragile cast of mind when cross-examining B1, this was neither borne out by the notes of evidence nor did it cohere with my observation of B2. B2 was not “emotional” when cross-examining B1.[^153] B2 confronted B1 with documentary evidence.[^154] And B2 also pointed out to B1: “You are not answering my question, Mr Raj.”**[^155]**

167     **S**econd, B2 was given ample time to cross-examine B1 during the trial.[^156] In fact, although B2 had completed cross-examining B1 on 10 October 2017,[^157] B2 was given the leeway to continue his cross-examination on 11 October 2017.[^158]

168    Finally, the Court of Appeal in _Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 306</span> stated at \[70\]:

> If Tan’s would-be counsel were allowed by the court to cross-examine the witnesses all over again and devise new submissions, that would surely be unfair to the Prosecution, which had already presented its case, and, indeed, to all the other relevant parties, such as the witnesses if they had to be recalled. On the latter point, we would draw attention to this court's ruling in _Sim Cheng Hui v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 670</span> that the **_court's power to recall witnesses in criminal proceedings should be exercised “sparingly and judiciously to the just decision of the case”_** (at \[30\]). Put another way, fairness is a multifaceted concept even in criminal proceedings, and a concession to an accused's right to counsel cannot be allowed to progress to an abuse of the judicial process. \[emphasis added in bold italics\]

169    The Court of Appeal’s comments in _Tan Chor Jin_ are relevant to our case, where B2 had discharged his counsel during the trial and represented himself.[^159] For completeness, B2 was then on bail and he was not precluded from getting legal representation.  

170    For the above reasons, I did not allow the application to recall B1 for further cross-examination. Being self-represented is not a chrysalis for legal representation.

## Conclusion

171    Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused Persons. Accordingly, I convicted both Accused Persons on their respective charges.

### Summary

172    A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:

> (a)      **Issue 1:** Yes, the s 21 MDA presumption was invoked (at \[61\] to \[62\]).

> (b)      **Issue 2:** Yes, s 18(4) MDA was invoked (at \[63\] to \[77\]).

> (c)      **Issue 3:** Yes, the s 18(2) MDA presumption was invoked (at \[78\] to \[82\]).

> (d)      **Issue 4:** No, the Accused Persons failed to rebut the presumptions on a balance of probabilities (at \[83\] to \[115\]). Both Accused Persons also had actual knowledge of the specific nature of the drugs (_viz._ cannabis).

173     **Ancillary Hearing**: After an ancillary hearing, B1’s Long Statements were admitted into evidence (at \[116\] to \[133\]). These statements incriminated B2 (at \[134\] to \[156\]).

174     **Application to Recall a Witness**: B2’s application to recall B1 for further cross-examination was not acceded to (at \[157\] to \[170\]).

175    Taken as a whole, the Prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused Persons. Accordingly, I convicted both Accused Persons on their respective charges.

176    I will proceed to hear submissions on sentence for B2.
