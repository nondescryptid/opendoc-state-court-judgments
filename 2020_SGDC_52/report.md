\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9031/2020/01.\]

6 March 2020

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

## BACKGROUND

The Accused, Mr Muhammad Nizam Bin Mohamed Kassim, _claimed trial_ to an “LT-2” charge for consumption of methamphetamine under section 8(b)(ii) punishable under section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”).

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him on the charge. I sentenced the Accused to a term of 7 years and 4 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The Accused being dissatisfied with his _conviction and sentence_ has filed an appeal. He did not apply for bail pending appeal and is currently _serving sentence_.

3       I had provided brief oral grounds at the conclusion of the trial to explain some of my findings and my decision to convict the Accused. These were captured in the Transcripts for 22 January 2020 at pages 1 to 4.

## THE CHARGE

4       The details of the charge against the Accused were as follows:

> DAC-935720-2018

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on or before **2 October 2018**, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, **methamphetamine**, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act,

> and further,

> that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 18 October 2012 in District Court No. 3, _vide_ DAC 30663/2012, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, morphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punished under Section 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years and 3 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you are thereby liable to be punished under Section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

## UNDISPUTED FACTS AND THE ISSUES AT TRIAL

5       During the trial, it was not disputed that the Accused was arrested on 2 October 2018, at about 4.25pm, from his flat. The arrest report was admitted and marked Exhibit P1. There was nothing incriminating found in the flat or in the Accused’s possession at the material time.

6       The Accused also did not dispute the fact that, after he was brought to Ang Mo Kio (“AMK”) Police Division on the day of his arrest, his urine specimens were procured at about 11.30pm. It was not disputed that the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) conducted on his urine specimen found his urine to be positive for amphetamine and benzodiazepines (Exhibit P2).

7       Further, it was not disputed that the Accused’s urine specimens were subsequently sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. Two certificates (Exhibits P3 and P4) were issued under section 16 of the MDA by the analysts from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory, namely Ms Bellene Chung (PW8) and Ms Goh Mei Ling Evelyn (PW9), stating that the Accused’s urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine.

8       It was also not disputed that the Accused had previous drug-related convictions as stated in the Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions in Exhibit P5.

9       The prosecution’s case was that the Accused’s urine specimens were procured in accordance with the process set out in the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations (Cap 185, Rg 6, 1999 Ed.). Thus, the prosecution relied on the presumption in section 22 of the MDA to prove the charge against the Accused.

10     The Accused took the position that he had not knowingly consumed methamphetamine and raised the following defences to rebut the presumption in section 22 of the MDA:

> (a)     The Accused had dropped all 3 urine bottles into the toilet bowl in the lock-up toilet before providing his urine specimens, and the urine procurement officer, Sergeant Wong Miao Hui (PW3 – “Sgt Wong”) did not allow him to change the bottles. Thus, his urine specimens were tainted by the contaminated bottles;

> (b)     While the Accused was passing motion in the toilet after providing his urine specimens, Sgt Wong had transferred the Accused’s urine from the master bottle into the 2 smaller bottles, capped the bottles and sealed them, out the Accused’s sight.

11     The Accused admitted the following CCTV footages of the lock-up at AMK Police Division in support of his defence[^1]:

12     During the trial and in his closing submissions, the Accused also raised, or alluded to, the following allegations:

> (a)     Before his urine was procured, the Accused was served tainted water by the lock-up officers whilst he was in the lock-up;

> (b)     Sgt Wong may have transferred the Accused’s urine from the master bottle into empty bottles found in the lock-up toilet;

> (c)     Before his arrest, the Accused had consumed Romilar, Epam and Codeine tablets which he had obtained from illicit sources.

## THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

13     The prosecution called 13 witnesses to prove their case against the Accused. Their evidence is summarised below.

#### The arrest

14     Sergeant Wong Ye Ting, Felicia (PW1 – “Sgt Felicia”) and Senior Staff Sergeant Mohamed Sha’ari Bin Mohamed Ayob (PW2 – “SSSgt Sha’ari”) were the arresting officers. They testified that on 2 October 2018 at about 4pm, they were despatched to the Accused’s flat in response to a call to the police made by the Accused’s sister stating “my brother taking drugs”[^2].

15     When the officers arrived, they noticed that the Accused’s wife was in the living room carrying a baby while the Accused was first spotted fully naked in the toilet located in the kitchen[^3]. The Accused informed SSSgt Sha’ari that he was going to have a shower and wanted to repair the toilet bowl.

16     When SSSgt Sha’ari interviewed the Accused, the Accused told SSSgt Sha’ari that he was facing family issues as he did not have a proper job. SSSgt Sha’ari then asked the Accused if he had consumed any controlled drugs and the Accused responded in Malay saying that he had taken some “ubat” to calm himself and help him relax.

17     SSSgt Sha’ari testified that “ubat” in Malay referred to medicine, and, according to his understanding, it was a term used for a controlled substance or drug. During the course of the interview, SSSgt Sha’ari observed the Accused to be slurry in speech and wary of his surroundings. During cross-examination, SSSgt Sha’ari explained that the Accused was looking around but appeared dazed at times[^4]. Based on his assessment, SSSgt Sha’ari believed that the Accused may have consumed controlled drugs. The Accused was thus placed under arrest, and escorted to the lock-up at AMK Police Division[^5].

#### The provision of water to the Accused at the lock-up

18     Sgt Wong testified that he was the “lock-up IC” on night shift duty at AMK Police Division on 2 October 2018. One of his duties was to procure the urine specimens of persons who have been arrested[^6].

19     Sgt Wong gave evidence that the Accused had already been placed in the lock-up when he took over the duties. However, Sgt Wong noticed that the Accused had yet to provide his urine specimens. Hence, from about 8pm, Sgt Wong arranged for water to be served to the Accused by the auxiliary police officers (“APOs”) on duty at the lock-up. Sgt Wong explained that the water served by the APOs was obtained from the water cooler located behind the lock-up registry. However, persons in custody also had a source of water within the cells and they could use the cup provided to them to drink from this source[^7]. During cross-examination, Sgt Wong testified that the cup used by the Accused was a new one which Sgt Wong had obtained from the registry[^8]. In addition, every half an hour, Sgt Wong would instruct the APO to check if the Accused was able to provide his urine. If the Accused was not able to do so, the APO would retrieve the Accused’s cup and refill it for the Accused[^9].

20     Sgt Wong testified that the Accused was served water 4 times by the APOs and did not raise any complaint when he drank the water. Further, according to Sgt Wong, persons in custody for drug abuse offences were all housed in the same cell, and served water from the same sources[^10].

21     Mr Razali Bin Samin (PW11, “Mr Razali”) was a retired police officer who had previously been attached to AMK Police Division as the officer overall in charge of the lock-up. He was on duty when the Accused was first brought into the lock-up on 2 October 2018 at about 5.20pm[^11]. Mr Razali testified that the Accused was placed in a cell, and at about 6pm, he was offered water to drink and he drank a cup of water. Altogether, the Accused was served water 4 times by the lock-up officers. Mr Razali also testified that the water served to the Accused was obtained from the lock-up registry where water was available from the tap or the water cooler. The registry also had an ample supply of new styrofoam cups which were used to serve the water[^12]. Each person in custody had his own styrofoam cup and the cups would not be reused for other persons[^13].

22     During cross-examination, Mr Razali testified that there was a source of water within the cell where one can push a button to cause water to flow out from a hole in the wall[^14].

#### The urine procurement process

23     Sgt Wong described the urine procurement process from the Accused as follows:

> (a)     The Accused was brought out from his cell to the registry by the APO[^15].

> (b)     The Accused was instructed to wash his hands at the basin behind Sgt Wong’s table at the registry.

> (c)     The Accused then chose 1 sealed red-capped bottle (“master bottle” – a sample, originally packed and sealed in a plastic bag, was tendered as Exhibit P6) from a lot with not less than 10. The Accused also chose 2 sealed blue-capped bottles (samples, originally individually packed and sealed in plastic bags, were tendered as Exhibit P7) from a lot with not less than 20[^16]. These bottles were kept in a box at Sgt Wong’s table[^17].

> (d)     The Accused was escorted to the lock-up toilet.

> (e)     Inside the toilet, the Accused opened the individual plastic wrappings sealing the 3 bottles.

> (f)     The Accused was then instructed to urinate into the master bottle and to provide at least 80ml of his urine. Sgt Wong was present when the Accused gave his urine.

> (g)     Thereafter, the Accused was instructed to and did transfer some of his urine into the 2 blue-capped bottles[^18].

> (h)     Sgt Wong then capped all 3 bottles in the presence of the Accused and carried the 3 bottles while escorting the Accused back to the registry with the assistance of an APO[^19].

> (i)     At the registry, Sgt Wong tested the bottles to see if there was any leakage and proceeded to seal the 3 bottles with masking tape in the Accused’s presence (samples of blue-capped bottles sealed with masking tape were tendered as Exhibit P8).

> (j)     Sgt Wong then took 2 polymer bags with the Accused’s name and IC number written on them. He proceeded to seal the master bottle in 1 polymer bag and the 2 blue-capped bottles in the other polymer bag, in the Accused’s presence. The bags containing the bottles would then be held by the Accused until the IUT was conducted.

> (k)     Thereafter, Sgt Wong placed the Accused back in the cell to wait for the IUT[^20].

24     During cross-examination, when queried by the Accused as to whether the Accused had passed motion in the lock-up toilet during the urine procurement process, Sgt Wong’s response was that he could not remember the Accused passing motion[^21]. Sgt Wong also disagreed that the Accused had dropped all 3 bottles into the toilet bowl and that he had refused to change the bottles even though the Accused had insisted that he do so. Sgt Wong refuted the Accused’s allegations that he had asked one of the APOs to shine light from a handphone into the toilet and that he had also asked for toilet paper to wipe the bottles clean[^22]. Sgt Wong explained that if the bottles had indeed been dropped, he would have stopped the urine procurement and restarted the entire process from the washing of hands and choosing the bottles again[^23]. Sgt Wong further disagreed with the Accused’s position that there were empty urine bottles placed on the parapet or in a wastepaper basket in the toilet. Sgt Wong added that there was no wastepaper basket in the toilet. Sgt Wong also disagreed with the Accused’s suggestion that he had swapped the original red and blue-capped bottles with empty ones in the toilet when the Accused was passing motion[^24].

25     Sgt Wong testified that there was a source of water in the form of a hole in the wall of the toilet, which was above head-level. Sgt Wong added that a person may press on the tap and use the water to bathe or wash their hands[^25].

#### Evidence of the escorting officers

26     APO Tan Lee Huat (PW4 – “APO Tan”) was an AETOS officer attached to the AMK Police Division lock-up at the material time. Besides performing escort duties, he also served meals and drinks to the persons in custody. He testified that the water for the detainees were obtained from the water dispenser in the lock-up office. Besides the detainees, the officers in the lock-up would also drink from the same water dispenser[^26].

27     Although APO Tan could not specifically recall the Accused, it was not disputed during the trial that he was one of the 2 escorting officers for the Accused during the urine procurement process.

28     When shown the footage in Exhibit D1 at the timing of 11:33:38pm (i.e. run-time 00:03:38), APO Tan testified that he had reached out his hand towards the shoe rack near the lock-up toilet door (where slippers for persons in custody were stored) and retrieved a can of air freshener. Further, at the timing of 11:33:45pm (i.e. run-time 00:03:45), APO Tan explained that the footage showed him standing at the door of the lock-up toilet spraying the air freshener into the toilet. At the same time, APO Tan’s colleague, Chin Boon Chien (PW5, “APO Chin”) was holding onto a toilet roll. APO Tan explained that the person being escorted (i.e. the Accused) was passing motion and he was spraying air freshener while the toilet paper was provided for the same person to clean himself[^27].

29     During cross-examination, APO Tan explained that handphones were prohibited inside the police lock-up and he had kept his phone in his bag which was placed inside a cabinet in the charge office[^28]. In addition, although he could not remember escorting the Accused specifically, APO Tan testified that generally there were no empty urine bottles lying around in the lock-up toilet[^29].

30     The other escorting officer, APO Chin, also testified that he could not remember the Accused[^30]. However, APO Chin confirmed that he could be seen in Exhibit D1 at the timing of 11:33:39pm (i.e. run-time 00:03:39) holding on to some toilet paper. APO Chin testified that this was for the use of the person in custody (i.e. the Accused) to clean himself, as the person was passing motion. APO Chin also confirmed that at the same time in the footage, APO Tan could be seen holding a can of air freshener. APO Chin explained that the air freshener was usually employed when the person being escorted was passing motion. APO Chin also confirmed that handphones were not permitted in the lock-up area, including in the area seen in the footage in Exhibit D1[^31].

31     During cross-examination, APO Chin agreed that there was access to water in the toilet. However, he testified that the water source would not usually be used for washing up after a person has passed motion, as it was meant for showering and would cause the whole body of the person to become wet[^32].

#### The instant urine test, urine sealing and delivery

32     The evidence given by Sgt Wong, Sergeant Guok Yow Yong Samson (PW7, IUT operator) and CNB officer Lim Zhong Hsien (PW6, urine despatch officer) pertaining to the IUT, urine sealing and urine delivery processes were largely unchallenged by the Accused[^33].

33     As the prosecution has succinctly set out these officers’ evidence at \[12\] to \[14\] of their closing submissions, I do not propose to repeat the same in these grounds.

#### The urine analysis – evidence of the HSA analysts

34     Ms Bellene Chung (PW8) performed the analysis on one of the Accused’s urine specimens and her findings were set out in the HSA certificate in Exhibit P3[^34].

35     Ms Goh Mei Ling Evelyn (PW9, “Ms Evelyn Goh”) performed the analysis on the Accused’s other urine specimen and her findings were as stated in the HSA certificate in Exhibit P4[^35]. During cross-examination, she testified that the concentration of methamphetamine in the urine sample she analysed was 2790ng/mL of urine.

36     Both Ms Bellene Chung and Ms Evelyn Goh testified that the consumption of Epam tablets containing the active ingredient nitrazepam (which is not a controlled drug) would not give rise to methamphetamine in the urine. This would the same for consumption of Romilar containing the active ingredient dextromethorphan as well as consumption of Codeine[^36].

#### Evidence of the investigation officers

37     CNB officer Staff Sergeant Muhammad Othman Al-Siddiq Bin Rahman (PW12, “SSgt Othman”) was attached to AMK Police Division at the material time. He took over the Accused’s case from the police after the Accused’s urine was first tested positive for controlled drugs and proceeded to record a statement from the Accused on 3 October 2018 (Exhibit D5). The Accused was released from custody on station bail thereafter on the same day.[^37]

38     After receiving the HSA certificates indicating that the Accused’s urine was tested positive for methamphetamine, SSgt Othman recorded a further statement from the Accused on 30 October 2018 (Exhibit D6)[^38]. According to SSgt Othman, the Accused had only raised one issue pertaining to the urine procurement process. As the Accused had raised the issue when his further statement was recorded on 30 October 2018, SSgt Othman had included it in the statement. According to SSgt Othman, the issue was pertaining to the Accused’s urine being transferred from the master bottle into the 2 blue capped bottles and temporarily sealed, out of his sight. SSgt Othman confirmed that the Accused did not make any complaint pertaining to urine bottles falling into the toilet bowl[^39]. During cross-examination, SSgt Othman testified that the Accused had asked for his urine to be taken again after he learnt that his HSA results were positive for methamphetamine[^40].

39     As the Accused had denied consumption of controlled drugs in his further statement, the case was transferred to the Investigation Branch at CNB Headquarters for follow up[^41].

40     ASP Goh Pei Ying (PW10, “ASP Goh”) was the investigation officer for the case until February 2019. Her role was to investigate the claims that the Accused had made with regards to his urine test[^42]. ASP Goh told the Court that as of February 2019, the Accused’s only contention was that his urine samples were not sealed with masking tape in his presence during the urine procurement process. As such, ASP Goh obtained CCTV footages of the office inside the lock-up, which showed that the Accused’s urine was sealed in his presence[^43].

41     ASP Goh confirmed that the Accused did not raise the fact that his urine bottles had dropped into the toilet bowl to her[^44]. The Accused also did not mention to ASP Goh that the police officer appeared to be sleepy during the urine procurement process or that he was urging the Accused to be quick[^45].

## THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

42     At the close of the prosecution’s case, after hearing submissions from both parties, I found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused on the proceeded charge and called upon the Accused to give evidence in his own defence. The Accused elected to testify, and he was the sole witness for the defence.

_The dropped urine bottles_

43     Firstly, the Accused raised what may be termed the “dropped bottles” defence. The Accused testified that while he was inside the lock-up toilet with Sgt Wong, the 2 APOs were standing guard at the door. At that time, he was handcuffed to the front and holding all 3 urine bottles. During cross-examination, the Accused demonstrated that he was holding the master bottle (Exhibit P6) in his right hand and the 2 smaller bottles (Exhibit P7) in his left hand[^46]. The Accused explained that although he knew that he was only supposed to urinate into the master bottle, he understood that he was also supposed to pour the urine into the 2 smaller bottles himself[^47].

44     As he was about to give his urine, all 3 bottles slipped from his hands and dropped inside the toilet bowl. The Accused managed to scoop up all the bottles quickly and told Sgt Wong that he wished to have them changed to new ones. However, Sgt Wong instructed the APOs to obtain toilet paper to clean the bottles instead. When the Accused intervened and told Sgt Wong it was not proper and that the Accused was worried the bottles might be unclean, Sgt Wong assured the Accused that he would clean them properly. Sgt Wong also told the Accused to hurry up and he had something to do after urine procurement[^48].

45     When the Accused mentioned that he had a stomachache, Sgt Wong told the Accused to provide his urine before passing motion. As such, the Accused again held on to all 3 urine bottles and provided his urine into the master bottle. Thereafter he placed all 3 bottles on top of the parapet wall behind the toilet bowl[^49].

46     The Accused testified that he had mentioned the dropping of his urine bottles when his statement was recorded by SSgt Othman. However, SSgt Othman told the Accused that this was irrelevant since the bottles had been wiped clean. In fact, the Accused had wanted to mention the entire urine process in his statement but SSgt Othman appeared angry with the Accused and decided not to include this[^50].

47     Further the Accused also told ASP Goh to check the CCTV footage and the body-worn camera of the officers. He also told her that SSgt Wong looked sleepy during the procurement process[^51].

_The improper transfer of urine and sealing of urine bottles_

48     The other main strand of the Accused’s defence was that his urine was transferred from the master bottle to the 2 blue-capped bottles and were capped and sealed by Sgt Wong, out of his sight, thus contravening the procedural requirements of having these done in his presence.

49     According to the Accused, the 3 urine bottles were placed on the parapet wall behind him when he was passing motion. He told Sgt Wong to leave them there as he wanted to deal with them himself. However, after the Accused was done and had cleaned himself with water, he saw that the 2 blue-capped bottles were full and all 3 bottles had been sealed and capped. When the Accused questioned Sgt Wong, Sgt Wong claimed that he had other urgent matters to attend to and needed to hurry[^52].

_The other allegations_

50     In his first statement recorded on 3 October 2018, in relation to his positive IUT results, the Accused had mentioned his consumption of Romilar, Epam, and Codeine tablets which he had bought from an illicit source (\[4\], Exhibit D5). When testifying in Court, the Accused explained that he had provided SSgt Othman with these details as he wanted to ensure that the illicit medication would not give rise to any amphetamine in his urine[^53].

51     The Accused also explained in his testimony that he had questioned the prosecution witnesses about the drinks served to him in the lock-up as he wanted to ensure everything was done correctly[^54].

52     During cross-examination, the Accused agreed that he did not mention the dropping of the urine bottles in his Case for Defence. He said that this was due to inadequate space. The Accused also agreed that he had, however, included the improper sealing of the urine bottles without his presence, his consumption of Romilar, Epam and Codeine tablets, as well as contaminated water being served to him in the lock-up, in his Case for Defence.[^55]

## ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENCE AND THE COURT’S FINDINGS

_The presumption in section 22 of the MDA_

53     Section 22 of the MDA states:

> **22**.    If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(_b_), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(_b_).

54     Section 31(4)(b) of the MDA provides:

> (4)    A specimen of urine provided under this section shall be divided into 3 parts and dealt with, in such manner and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed, as follows:

>> …

>> (b)    each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or any person as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint for such purpose.

55     As the urine tests in this case were conducted in accordance with section 31(4)(b) of the MDA, the presumption in section 22 of the MDA applied. Consequently, both the _actus reas_ and _mens rea_ of the Accused consuming methamphetamine were presumed, and the burden shifted on the Accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not knowingly consume methamphetamine (**_Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 46</span> at \[10\] and \[46\]; **_Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 84</span> at \[15\]). The Accused attempted to do so by way of his various allegations levied, in the main, against the urine procurement process.

_The allegation concerning the dropped urine bottles_

56     I shall start my analysis with the allegation concerning the dropped urine bottles. To recap, the Accused’s case was that he had dropped all 3 urine bottles into the toilet bowl and Sgt Wong had refused to change them. This was because Sgt Wong was sleepy and was thus in a hurry. Instead, according to the Accused, Sgt Wong had asked for and used toilet paper to wipe the bottles. In addition, Sgt Wong had also asked an APO to use a handphone to shine light into the toilet so that Sgt Wong could ensure that he wiped all the bottles clean. The CCTV footage in Exhibits D1 to D4 were admitted in support of these allegations.

57     Having carefully scrutinised the evidence in this regard, I was of the view that the Accused’s allegations concerning the dropped urine bottles and Sgt Wong’s refusal to change them were spurious and an afterthought. My reasons were as follows.

58     Firstly, Sgt Wong had specifically denied these allegations by explaining that, had the bottles been dropped into the toilet bowl, he would have re-started the entire urine procurement process[^56]. I found Sgt Wong’s evidence in this regard to be logical and credible. The CCTV footage in Exhibit D4 clearly showed that the lock-up registry office where the bottles were kept, was but a short distance away from the toilet.

![]([2020] SGDC 0052_Image/[2020] SGDC 0052_image1.png)

59     Hence, even if it were true that Sgt Wong was sleepy and in a hurry as alleged by the Accused, the most efficacious way would be to simply bring the Accused back to the registry office to wash his hands, pick up 3 new bottles and return to the toilet. It would be illogical for Sgt Wong to instead request for toilet paper, wait for it to be brought to him, request for additional lighting from a handphone, and proceed to painstakingly clean 3 urine bottles which had just been fished out of the toilet bowl. Indeed, doing so would not only contravene the prohibition against having handphones in the lock-up, it would also mean that there would be additional witnesses to Sgt Wong’s alleged non-compliance with proper urine procurement protocol.

60     The Accused attempted to bolster his allegation that Sgt Wong neglected proper procedure as he was fatigued, by referring to the CCTV footage in Exhibit D3 at 12.50am (i.e. run-time 01:05:00), which showed Sgt Wong resting at the table in the registry office. In my view, the fact that Sgt Wong decided to take a break about an hour after the Accused’s urine was procured, was neither here nor there, and did not go to show that he was so tired to the extent of dereliction of his duties vis a vis the Accused.

61     Further, the Accused’s allegation was contradicted by objective evidence. Having viewed the CCTV footage in Exhibit D1 carefully, it was abundantly clear to me that, contrary to the Accused’s assertions, APO Tan was holding a cylindrical, purplish object in a manner consistent with how one would hold a spray can, with one finger upon the spray nozzle. The object did not at all resemble a handphone.

![]([2020] SGDC 0052_Image/[2020] SGDC 0052_image2.png)

62     Interestingly, while the Accused had explicitly and repeatedly put to Sgt Wong[^57], APO Tan[^58] and APO Chin[^59] that APO Tan was tasked by Sgt Wong to shine his handphone light into the toilet, and even confronted the witnesses with the same footage in Exhibit D1, the Accused made no mention of this fact at all while testifying in his own defence, or in his closing submissions. In my assessment, it was evident that the Accused had by then realised that the very CCTV footage admitted by him into evidence had demolished his own allegation. As such, he abandoned this aspect of his contention while continuing to insist that he had indeed dropped the bottles into the toilet bowl.

63     Having carefully considered the evidence, I accepted the testimony of the prosecution witnesses that Sgt Tan was holding a can of air-fresher over the door of the toilet because the Accused was passing motion at that juncture, and rejected the Accused’s version in this regard. Further, the CCTV evidence also clearly showed that the toilet paper and the air-freshener were procured by the APOs concurrently. In my view, this buttressed the prosecution’s case that the toilet paper was obtained for the Accused to clean himself after he had passed motion, and not for Sgt Wong to wipe the bottles clean.

64     Most tellingly, the Accused had failed to mention his allegation concerning the dropped urine bottles to any of the investigation officers, in any of his statements admitted as evidence in Court (Exhibits D5 and D6), and in his Case for the Defence, even though this allegation featured most prominently at trial. The Accused attempted to account for this omission by making allegations against the investigation officers that they were prejudiced against him, and refused to include this in his statements in an attempt to cover up for Sgt Wong. He also complained of the alleged lack of space to pen this down in his Case for the Defence, even though he admitted that he had instead included the allegations concerning the sealing of the urine bottles, the consumption of illicit medications and contaminated water being served to him in the lock-up.

65     I found that the Accused’s explanations to be contrived and unconvincing. As mentioned by SSgt Othman, if he were prejudiced against the Accused, he would not have included reference to the illicit medication as well as the purported improper sealing of the urine bottes in the Accused’s statements in Exhibits D5 and D6.

#### The allegation concerning improper transfer of urine and sealing of urine bottles

66     I now turn to the Accused’s allegation that while he was passing motion in the toilet, Sgt Wong had transferred his urine from the master bottle to the 2 blue-capped bottles, capped the bottles and sealed them with tape behind his back, out of his sight. This allegation was reflected in \[8\] of the Accused’s statement in Exhibit D6 as follows:

> “When I had finished passing motion, I _turn around_ to take my urine specimen. But then I realized it has already been poured into 2 blue capped container, _sealed with white tape_, and the master bottle was left with only a small amount of urine. I was then asked to hold on to my urine and they escorted me to the CNB office.” (emphasis added)

67     In this regard, Sgt Wong’s evidence was that, whilst in the toilet, it was the Accused who poured the urine into the smaller bottles, following which Sgt Wong had capped the bottles in the Accused’s presence. Sgt Wong then brought the Accused back to the registry area, where Sgt Wong sealed all 3 bottles with masking tape, before putting the bottles into 2 polymer bags in the presence of the Accused and the APO escorting him.

68     To support his contention that it was Sgt Wong who had poured the urine, the Accused took the position that he could not have poured the urine as he was handcuffed. Having closely examined the sample urine bottles admitted into evidence (Exhibits P6 and P7), and looking at the manner in which the Accused was cuffed in the CCTV footage in Exhibit D1, I was of the view that it was quite possible for the Accused to pour the urine from the master bottle into the smaller bottles, even if he were handcuffed. In fact, the Accused ably demonstrated in Court how he could uncap the 3 urine bottles and pick up all 3 bottles in his hands while he was handcuffed[^60].

69     Again, besides scrutinising the witnesses’ testimony on this point, I had looked to the objective evidence to test the veracity of each party’s case. In this regard, I note that the 2 CCTV footages focusing on the desk at the registry area (Exhibits D2 and D3) showed Sgt Wong using a roll of tape to seal the urine bottles. Thereafter, Sgt Wong could be seen placing the bottles in 2 polymer bags before handing them to the Accused, just as he had testified to in Court. The Accused was clearly present and watching Sgt Wong during this process, and could be seen conversing with Sgt Wong at times. APO Tan could also be seen looking on by the side as well.

![]([2020] SGDC 0052_Image/[2020] SGDC 0052_image3.png)

70     Clearly, the objective evidence corroborated Sgt Wong’s testimony and debunked the Accused’s allegations. In view of the above, I rejected the Accused’s version and accepted Sgt Wong’s account.

#### The other allegations

71     I shall now turn to deal with the other allegations raised by the Accused. Firstly, as clarified by the Accused, he was not relying on his purported consumption of Epam, Romilar or Codeine tablets in his defence. In any event, it was clear that, based on the evidence of the 2 HSA analysts, the consumption of these tablets would not give rise to methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine.

72     As for the Accused’s allegation that Sgt Wong might have transferred his urine from the master bottle into empty bottles found in the lock-up toilet, this was, at the highest, pure speculation on the Accused’s part and unsupported by any evidence. In fact, the evidence of Sgt Wong and APO Tan indicated that there were no such empty urine bottles in the toilet to begin with. Further, since I have rejected the Accused’s version that he had dropped the 3 urine bottles into the toilet bowl, there was absolutely no reason for Sgt Wong to decide to switch the urine bottles when the Accused was not looking.

73     Finally, I come to the Accused’s allegation that he could have been served contaminated water at the lock-up before his urine was procured. Again, there was not a shred of evidence to indicate that the water, which was consumed by both the officers and persons in custody at the lock-up, was contaminated with methamphetamine. There was also no evidence to indicate that the cup used by the Accused was contaminated by methamphetamine. In his closing submissions, the Accused alluded to some sinister motive on the officers’ part to serve him water even though he could have helped himself to water within the cell. Clearly, as explained by Mr Razali, the Accused was served water so that the officers’ could monitor the Accused’s water consumption and ensure that he could provide his urine within the requisite time[^61].

74     Evidently, the above allegations were but potential defences conjured up by the Accused who was clutching at straws in a desperate attempt to explain the presence of methamphetamine in his urine specimens.

75     At the end of the trial, I had no difficulty finding that the Accused had failed to rebut the presumption in section 22 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities.

76     In conclusion, having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven the proceeded charge against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found the Accused guilty and convict him of the same.

## SENTENCE

#### Prescribed punishment

78     Section 33A(2) of the MDA provides for an _imprisonment term of not less than 7 years_ and not more than 13 years and _caning not less than 6 strokes_ and not more than 12 strokes.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

79     The prosecution sought a sentence of 7 years 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The prosecution explained that while they acknowledged the Accused’s right to claim trial, it did not translate to a liberty on the part of the Accused to blatantly besmirch the reputation of the prosecution’s witnesses behind the shield of judicial proceedings.

80     The prosecution further submitted that the manner in which the Accused conducted his spurious defence resulted in wastage of much investigative resources to verify his claims and prepare for trial. In particular, the prosecution had to call a total of 13 witnesses to testify in order to meet and answer all of the Accused’s claims. The Accused also made various unwarranted allegations against the prosecution witnesses, to the extent of calling their ethics into question.

81     The prosecution submitted that these revealed the Accused’s utter lack of remorse. As such, a 6-month uplift from the mandatory minimum was warranted.

#### Mitigation

82     The Accused initially informed the Court that he knew that he was not guilty and would be appealing against the decision. Subsequently, the Accused further submitted that the uplift of 6 months proposed by the prosecution was not fair. The Accused was not wasting resources or the Court’s time but was just defending his case as he believed he was innocent. The Accused asked the Court to pass the minimal sentence.

#### Sentence imposed

83     Having carefully considered the Accused’s antecedents, the prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I determined that an uplift of 4 months’ imprisonment from the mandatory minimum was warranted in this case.

84     I agreed with the prosecution that the Accused’s conduct of his defence evinced a lack of remorse on his part and I was of the view that a distinction was justified between a sentence meted out to an accused person who was genuinely remorseful and pleaded guilty, and the sentence meted out to the Accused in this case.

85     I therefore sentenced the Accused to 7 years 4 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. I backdated the sentence to the Accused’s first date of remand, which was 31 October 2018.
