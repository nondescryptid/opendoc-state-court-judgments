## The Prosecution’s Case

6       Besides the ASOF, the Prosecution called 5 other witnesses to support its case.

7       The Rochester was a condominium development developed by UE One-North Developments Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Engineers Development Pte Ltd (“**UED**”). It was launched to the public on 16 July 2007. (I will call these 2 companies and United Engineers Ltd collectively as the UE group).

8       Being a staff of UED, Faizal was entitled to book a unit at The Rochester (“**the unit**”) before the public launch and at a discounted price under the UE Staff Purchase Scheme (the “**Scheme**”). It was a benefit offered to staff in recognition of the staff contribution and service to the company. See ASOF-A for the terms and conditions of the Scheme. Faizal was entitled to purchase the unit at 3% discount off the net price in the form of a cash rebate set off against the balance of the purchase price payable upon the issue of the TOP. See ASOF at \[5\].

9       Sometime before 16 July 2007, Faizal agreed with the Accused to book and buy a unit on the Accused’s behalf. The Accused was not a staff of the UE Group.

10     On 16 July 2007, Faizal managed to book the unit at $1,209,116 which was lower than the lowest possible price that members of the public could purchase on or after 16 July 2007.

11     On 31 August 2007, the unit was sold by the Accused in a sub-sale for $1,470,000.

12     On account of Faizal using his position as employee of UED to obtain on the Accused’s behalf a unit at The Rochester, the Prosecution contended that the Accused had promised Faizal 2% of the profit from the subsequent sale of the unit. The promise was made before the public launch. Being so induced, Faizal did book a unit on the Accused’s behalf at a price that was unavailable to members of the public. Faizal also executed all the necessary documents to enable the Accused to have all the rights over the unit.

## The Case for the Defence

13     The Accused elected to give evidence. He did not call any other witnesses to give evidence in his defence. Essentially, the Defence contended that there was no corrupt element in the transaction and that there was no guilty knowledge on the part of the Accused that what he did was corrupt.

## The Law

14     The legal elements of an offence under s6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241 (“**PCA**”) which penalizes the conduct of the corrupt giver are well-settled law.

15     Briefly, these are the 4 legal elements:

> (a)     Element 1: The accused gave or offered gratification to any agent;

> (b)     Element 2: As an inducement (or reward) for doing anything in relation to his principal’s affairs or business;

> (c)     Element 3: There was a corrupt element in the transaction;

> (d)     Element 4: The accused offered or gave the gratification with a guilty knowledge, i.e., he knew that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard. See _Kwang Boon keong Peter v PP \[1998\] 2 SLR 211 at \[32\]_ where the High Court held that “the word”, “corruptly”, carries a uniform meaning in both section 5 and 6 of the Act and that the third and fourth elements should be given the same interpretation with respect to both sections”.

16     Gratification is defined in section 2 of PCA to include offer or promise of any money, reward or interest in property of any description.

## Element 1 – Offering gratification of an unspecified amount of money to agent

17     It was conceded by the Accused that the agreement with Faizal to pay him a share of any profits constituted an offer for gratification[^1]. The Accused agreed that there was an arrangement with Faizal for him to use his name to purchase a unit at The Rochester on the Accused’s behalf and Faizal would be given a share of the profit upon the sale of the unit. The amount was not specified even though it was not disputed to be 2%. Although the Unit was subsequently sold at a higher price on 31 August 2007 for $1,470,000, the Accused did not give Faizal any share of the profit. The original purchase price was $1,209,116. Hence, the Accused had made a gross profit of about $260,884.

18     There was no dispute that Faizal was an agent as he was an employee of UED in 2007 and was paid a monthly salary of about $2000. Thus, I found the Prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt Element 1.

## Element 2 - Inducement

19     I found the Accused did offer to Faizal, an employee of UED, a 2% share of the profit to induce him into buying a unit at The Rochester, developed by a wholly owned subsidiary of UED, on behalf of the Accused. During the cross-examination, Faizal said that the 2% profit was the difference between the staff price and the public price for the purchase of the unit[^2].

20     In my view, the offer was an inducement or reward for Faizal to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs. In this regard, it was in relation to the sale of the unit at The Rochester developed by a wholly owned subsidiary of UED at staff price. It was the offer of a share in the profit that induced Faizal into booking the unit on the Accused’s behalf at a price lower than the lowest possible price the Unit would have been made available to the public on or after 16 July 2007. I was of the view that being stranger to each other, there was no reason why Faizal would agree to the arrangement with the Accused unless there was some benefit for him to do so.

## Corrupt Element in the transaction

21     I examined this issue by asking whether it could be said objectively that there was a corrupt element in the transaction.

22     I found that the Accused and Faizal did not know each other before July 2007. It was only through the introduction of PW3 Abdul Hadi Bin Rifaie (“**PW3 Hadi**”) that both the Accused and Faizal met. PW3 Hadi, in turn, was also a stranger to the Accused. The Accused first approached PW3 Hadi at the show flat of The Rochester regarding buying a unit at The Rochester. PW3 Hadi rejected the Accused’s request to buy a unit at The Rochester on his behalf as it would be in breach of the rules in the company and that he could be sacked.

23     It was not disputed that at the material time there was high demand for units in The Rochester. See \[3\] of ASOF. The property market was strong and the prices were on an uptrend. See ASOF-A. Each purchaser was only entitled to buy one unit.

24     Faizal, being an employee of UED, could be invited to purchase the unit at The Rochester on terms better than the public. In fact, Faizal was entitled to purchase the unit at a 3% discount off the net price during the sales’ preview reserved exclusively for the staff of UED or its subsidiaries before the public sales’ launch on 16 July 2007 (the “**staff benefit scheme**”). There was also a staff briefing before the launch of the units for sale.

25     Given the backdrop at \[22\]-\[24\] above, sometime before 16 July 2007, Faizal agreed with the Accused to buy a unit at The Rochester on the latter’s behalf (“**the Unit**”). Faizal booked the unit at the price of $1,209,116 which was lower than that which could be offered to the public. The booking fee for the Unit was provided by the Accused in the form of a cheque issued by the Accused’s brother.

26     The Accused also engaged a firm of solicitors to prepare an irrevocable Power of Attorney (“**POA**”) executed by Faizal in favour of the Accused, a trust deed declaring that Faizal held 100% of the Unit on trust for the Accused (the “**Declaration Deed**”) and an agreement that Faizal will purchase the Unit and hold it on trust for the Accused. All these documents were duly signed by the respective parties. In my view, these were not innocuous. It was done to protect the Accused’s own interests by ensuring that all the rights in the Unit were ceded to the Accused by Faizal. Clearly in view of the great demand for the units at The Rochester, the Accused knew that there would be profits to be made by taking advantage of the fact that Faizal was an employee of UED. The Accused knew that as an employee, Faizal would be able to buy a unit at a discounted price. Faizal, on the other hand, knew that the staff benefit scheme was meant for the benefit of the staff only. What Faizal did was to confer a benefit or advantage to the Accused at the expense of his company. The company lost the benefit of selling the Unit at the public price. Indeed, Faizal pleaded guilty and was convicted under section 6(a) of PCA. He was fined $5000. See exhibit P3 where the corrupt agreement was admitted to by Faizal.

27     Counsel highlighted that Faizal’s company knew of the circumstances. The developer’s lawyer knew about the POA and the Declaration Deed. On the other hand, I found that the 2% profit arrangement promised to Faizal by the Accused was not disclosed to UE group at the outset or to their lawyers.

28     Considering the circumstances above, particularly in the light of the high demand for the units at The Rochester, the exclusive pre-sale preview, the promise of a share of the profit and the discounted pricing for the employee and staff, the natural and reasonable inference to be drawn was that there was a corrupt element in the arrangement made between the Accused and Faizal. It was clearly a corrupt transaction. There were also other factors which supported my finding. I will elaborate them below.

29     On the facts, I found there was clearly an advantage gained or hoped to be gained by the Accused in the transaction. The transaction was clearly tainted which explained why the 2% profit was not disclosed initially to the company. This was only disclosed to Anita after Faizal had failed to obtain copies of the POA and Declaration deed from the Accused.

30     Faizal also lied to Anita that his family wanted to buy the unit as he did not want her to know the arrangement which he had with the Accused as he knew it was against the company’s policy. The lie showed that Faizal knew it was wrong for him to enter into an arrangement with the Accused to buy a unit on the Accused’s behalf.

31     With due respect, the arrangement between the Accused and Faizal was not similar to a hypothetical case of Faizal obtaining a loan from a bank. In this case, all the funding was provided by the Accused. As highlighted by the Prosecution, here the Accused had obtained full control of the property to deal in any way he deemed fit unlike a classic case of a bank loan where the bank merely held the property as security.

32     The Defence also contended that the arrangement made with Faizal was unobjectionable as the UE group was not concerned about the employee’s source of fund for the purchase or the subsequent sub-sale for a nominal profit. I agreed with the Prosecution that the arrangement was “objectionable because they had intended at the outset, to use PW4 Faizal’s position as an employee to obtain a unit at the staff price for the accused, in exchange for a sum of money.”[^3] The employees including Faizal had been briefed that they were not allowed to obtain a unit at The Rochester at a staff price on behalf of a member of the public.[^4]

33     It was also contended that the arrangement between the Accused and Faizal was an innocuous profit-sharing commercial agreement. With respect, I disagreed. Firstly, the Accused did not share any profit from the sub-sale with Faizal. I rejected the bare allegation that the Accused did not give a share of the profit was because Faizal had breached the agreement by trying to sell the Unit himself. In fact, Faizal denied that he had tried to make any sub-sale. Moreover, he had divested his interest in the unit as evidenced by the POA, the Declaration Deed and the Trust Agreement. See ASOF-E, ASOF-F and ASOF-G. The Accused also did not call the person from the law firm who allegedly informed him about Faizal’s attempt to sub-sell.

34     I also noted that this allegation of innocuous profit-sharing agreement was contrary to \[3c\] of the Declaration Deed which states that Faizal “consents to all the proceeds of sale being issued in the sole name of GOH CHAN CHONG (WU ZHENZHONG)) and will not require any share of the same to be given to him”.

35     With respect, I did not agree that the UE group was amenable to the arrangement made between the Accused and Faizal because they did not terminate Faizal’s booking or the sale transaction after being made aware of the POA and the Declaration Deed received by UE’s lawyers on 16 August 2007. I noted that the documents submitted to the UE Group’s lawyers did not disclose the arrangement the Accused had made with Faizal at the outset to use the latter to buy the unit on the Accused’s behalf at staff price before the public launch in exchange for a share of the profits from the subsequent sale of the unit. The various prosecution witnesses (PW5 Liew, PW1 Quek and PW2 Chan) had testified that this arrangement was not acceptable. In this respect, for the reasons stated at \[23\] and \[24\]of the PWS, I agreed with the Prosecution that PW1 Quek’s evidence as a whole showed that the arrangement was wrong.

36     PW2 Chan confirmed that for a staff to enter into arrangement to use his staff privileges to obtain a unit on behalf of the public would be in breach of Clauses 3.1.4 or 3.2.1 of United Engineers Limited Group Operating Manual (“**GOM**”) dated May 2004. See exhibit 1. These clauses were also found in the 2015 version of the GOM. See exhibit P2. Exhibits P1 and P2 prescribe a code of ethics for the staff. PW2 Chan confirmed that it would also apply to non-executive.[^5] Faizal acknowledged that such clauses applied to him[^6]. PW3 Haidi a driver of the company, also agreed that such code of ethics applied to all staff[^7]. Exhibit P1 stated expressly that all staff were expected to comply with the code of ethics. In any event, I found that before the launch of The Rochester, Faizal had been briefed that he was not allowed to obtain the unit at staff price for members of the public. This was also fortified by an email dated 18 May 2007 sent to all employees of UED. See exhibit ASOF-A.

37     I also agreed with the Prosecution that contrary to the Accused’s contention, PW2 Chan did not agree that there was no objection to an employee buying a unit at the staff price as part of a commercial agreement with a 3rd party where they had to share the benefits from such a purchase.[^8] Clearly PW2 Chan’s evidence was that if the commercial arrangement was intended to benefit the staff himself then it was not objectionable. However, if it was done at the request of the 3rd party for the latter’s benefit then it would not be acceptable. In any event, the hypothetical scenario put to PW2 Chan was not the same situation as the present case which was not a legitimate commercial agreement but a corrupt arrangement as stated above.

## Faizal’s Conviction

38     The Defence suggested that Faizal pleaded guilty to a mirror charge under section 6(a) of PCA out of convenience and that he did not have the requisite _mens rea_. With respect, based on my findings above, Faizal knew it was corrupt to accept the Accused’s offer of the 2% share of the profit on account of obtaining a unit at The Rochester in his name for the Accused’s benefit. The 2% profit was a fact not disclosed at the outset and was inconsistent with the Declaration Deed. Faizal also did not say that he was not guilty. I noted that he was represented by counsel in the proceeding where he had pleaded guilty. In his mitigation plea, there was not qualification at all that he decided to plead guilty because he would likely be fined. In fact, he admitted to the statement of fact supporting the charge and admitted to the commission of the offence without any qualification. I therefore rejected this suggestion. In my view, Faizal’s conviction and his PG papers which were admitted into evidence as exhibit P3 also indicated that the transaction made between the Accused and Faizal was tainted and corrupt.

## Guilty Knowledge

39     Besides proving a corrupt element, there must also be proved that the Accused had guilty knowledge that what he was doing was corrupt according to the ordinary and objective standard. The High Court in _Fong Ser Joo William v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 12</span>_ (“**_Fong William_**”) held at \[33\] that the analysis under Element 4 was a subjective test with an inherent objective element “in that the guilty knowledge was that of knowing or realizing that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard.”

40     It was not in dispute that at the material time the demand was high for the units at The Rochester. The prices were on an upward trend. See ASOF-A. It was not disputed that the lowest price the public could have bought for the Unit was $1,329,716. See ASOF-B. The Accused also knew that Faizal being an employee of UED can purchase a unit at a discounted price before the public launch of The Rochester. That explained why in the first instance the Accused approached PW3 Hadi for assistance. PW3 Hadi rejected the Accused’s overture. PW3 Hadi then introduced Faizal to the Accused. In this context, I was of the view that the Accused was motivated by financial gain when he entered into an arrangement with Faizal to take advantage of Faizal’s status as an employee of UED to purchase a unit before the public launch and at a staff rate on his behalf. For the purpose of this arrangement, the Accused did offer to Faizal a 2% share of the profit upon the sale of the unit. However, in the Declaration Deed it was stated that all the proceeds of sale were to be given to the Accused alone and Faizal will not require any share of the proceeds of sale to be given to him. See \[34\] above. In my view, if the Accused did not have the guilty knowledge there was no reason to hide the fact that he had promised to give Faizal a share of the profit.

41     Faizal testified that the Accused had told him that he wanted a unit at The Rochester so that he could live near his mother. I did not believe this was the reason. If it were true, why was there a sub-sale soon after Faizal had booked the Unit. The Accused could have conveyed the Unit to his own name. As indicated at \[40\] above, I was of the view that the Accused was motivated by financial gain and had a guilty knowledge that the transaction was corrupt.

42     I found that Faizal also told the Accused that to buy a unit under his name for the Accused , he would get into trouble as it was wrong for him to get the unit for the Accused in exchange for the profit. Faizal had also mentioned to the Accused that the staff price was not for members of the public. To allay his fear, the Accused assured him that he will get a lawyer to ensure that Faizal would not be implicated. The Accused also offered money to Faizal to induce him to get a unit at staff price on his behalf. In this respect, clearly the Accused was aware that such arrangement was contrary to the intent and policy of UED.

43     Next, the Trust Agreement (ASOF-G) at \[2\] stated that Faizal had no right to claim any monetary benefit from the Accused. This was clearly untrue as the Accused had promised to give 2% of the profit to Faizal. In my view, this was also a clear indicator of the guilty knowledge on the part of both the Accused and Faizal.

44     It was contended that there was no guilty knowledge as the Accused’s lawyers had openly prepared the documentation relating to the transaction of the Unit and most of these were sent to the UE group’s lawyers. However, these documents dated 1 August 2007 (the “**POA and Declaration Deed**”) sent to the UE Group did not state that there was already an arrangement between the Accused and Faizal for the latter to book the Unit at staff price for the benefit of the Accused in exchange for a share of the sale profits. The agreement between the Accused and Faizal for the purchase of a unit at The Rochester on the Accused’s behalf was made sometime before 16 July 2007.

45     Next, the contents of the Trust Agreement in particular\[2\] and \[7\] also indicated that the Accused knew that the arrangement made with Faizal was not aboveboard and he had to safeguard his interests. There was also no mention of the arrangement the Accused made with Faizal to obtain a unit on his behalf in exchange for a share of the future sale profits contrary to what had been agreed by the Accused and Faizal.

46     With respect, I rejected the claim that the Accused wanted to register the unit in the joint names of Faizal and himself. This was a bare allegation. On the other hand, Faizal testified that he did not recall the Accused ever discussing registering the Unit in the Accused’s name or in their joint names. In fact, the Accused told Faizal to use Faizal’s name to buy the unit for the Accused as he wanted to use the staff rate. The Accused also knew that by doing so Faizal might get into trouble and assured him that he will get his lawyer to do the paperwork to ensure Faizal would not be implicated.[^9]

47     Considering all these factors, I concluded that the Accused had the guilty knowledge when he promised a share of the profit to Faizal for booking the unit on his behalf.

## Guilty and Convicted

48     In the circumstances, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was guilty and convicted him on the charge.

## Sentencing Submissions

49     Both the Prosecution and the Defence submitted their respective written submissions on sentence.

50     The Prosecution submitted that the present case was a Category 1 private corruption case set out in _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 117</span>_ (“**_Romel_**”) and urged the court to impose a custodial sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment based on the _Masui_ framework. See _Takaai Masui v PP <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 160</span> (“_**_Masui_**_”)._

51     The Defence submitted for a fine of $7,500. It was highlighted that Faizal had been sentenced to a fine of $5,000.

## Mitigation

52     The Defence contended that the Accused should be treated as a first-time offender as the present offence was a stood down charge pending the trial of DAC 902788/2015 and DAC 902789/2015 in _PP v Goh Chan Chong <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 210</span> (“_**_Goh Chan Chong_**_”)_ . After the trial, the Accused was found guilty and convicted of these 2 charges (DAC902788/2015 DAC902789/2015). These 2 charges were substantially similar and reproduced below:

> _“You, Goh Chan Chong are charged that you, on a day between 16 July 2007 and October 2007, in Singapore, did corruptly give a gratification of S$50,000/- (Singapore Dollars Fifty Thousand Dollars Only) to one Suhaimi Bin Amin, being an agent, to wit, a Senior Manager in the employ of United Engineers Developments Pte Ltd, as a reward to the said Suhaimi Bin Amin for doing an acts in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, providing invitation cards to you for the launch for the sales of the Rochester condominium apartment units, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.”_

53     Counsel for the Accused highlighted several factors for the court’s consideration, namely:

> (a)     Faizal was fined $5,000;

> (b)     The offence committed was a private sector corruption;

> (c)     That the Accused had not taken any effort to conceal his purchase of the unit;

> (d)     No gratification was actually paid;

> (e)     The harm and culpability were slight.

## Sentencing Considerations

54     The primary sentencing consideration in all corruption cases is general deterrence. See _PP v Lim Teck Choon <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 577</span>_ at \[14\]. I agreed with both the Defence and Prosecution that the present case was a private sector corruption case falling within category 1 of the _Romel_ framework. “In this category whether the custodial sentence is crossed will depend on the facts.” See _Romel_ at \[27\]. On the facts of the case, I was of the view that a custodial sentence was warranted.

55     Next, I proceeded to identify and assess the offence-specific factors laid down in _Masui_ at \[239\] to determine the harm and culpability. At the time of writing these grounds of decision, I was also aware of the reservations made by Justice See over certain elements of the construct of the _Masui_ framework. See MA 9051/2021 – _Tan Yih Wei v PP_ at \[4\] and \[5\] (unreported). Since it was an unreported case, I was of the view that I was bound to follow the decision in _Masui_. In any event, the offence-specific factors and offender-specific factors are still applicable.

56     First, as contended by the Prosecution, the Accused offered to give to give 2% of the sale profit which amounted to $5,127.68 based on a sale profit of $260,884 ($1,470,000 - $1,209,116). On the other hand, the Defence submitted that the 2% amounted to $1,597.68 being 2% of the difference between the staff price and the public price as submitted by the Defence. Based on the evidence of Faizal, I accepted that the 2% referred to the difference between the staff price and the public price. Hence, the amount offered to Faizal could range from $1,597.68 to about $2,412 depending on whether it was bought on a deferred payment scheme or normal payment scheme.

57     Next, pursuant to the arrangement the Accused had made with Faizal, Faizal signed the OTP to buy the Unit for the Accused at $1,209,116 on 16 July 2007. The unit was sold by the Accused on 31 August 2007 for $1,470,00. Hence, the Accused had gained a benefit in terms of profit for about $260,884 within a short period of about 1.5 months.

58     I was of the view that as a result of the corrupt act by the Accused, UE group suffered a pecuniary loss in the sense that it could have sold the unit at a higher price to the public in view of the amount of interest generated for the demand of the units at The Rochester. I found that the loss to UE could be about $120,600 or $79,884 depending on whether the member of the public bought it under the deferred payment scheme or normal payment scheme. In either case, the amount was significant. The lowest selling price to the public on deferred payment scheme was about $1,329,700 while that on normal scheme was $1,289,000. The staff price was $1,209,116. By the Accused’s arrangement with Faizal, he was able to gain an unfair advantage over members of the public in terms of the choice of unit and pricing. Members of the public could also possibly suffer the loss of a chance to buy a unit given the strong market demand for the units in The Rochester at the material time. Through Faizal, the Accused was able to participate in the exclusive presale launch.

59     As to the factors going towards culpability, I considered the degree of planning and premeditation and also the Accused’s motive. I noted that the Accused had specifically sought out an employee of UE group to take advantage of the staff scheme where the employee had the privilege of a sales preview before the public launch and could buy at a discounted staff price. As was highlighted by the Prosecution, to “perpetuate the scheme, the accused engaged a lawyer to prepare legal documents to ensure that he had full control over the unit” [^10]. Clearly this warranted a deterrent sentence. With due respect, I therefore disagreed that there was a low degree of planning and premeditation.

60     I agreed with counsel that the Accused did not specifically target Faizal. But it was clear that the targeted person must be an employee of the UE group.

61     I also agreed that the motive of the Accused was for financial gain. I would add that it was for his personal gain which is generally an aggravating sentencing consideration.[^11]

62     Considering the above, I was of the view that the case fell under the Moderate Harm-Low to Medium Culpability Matric as per the _Masui_ framework. Based on the matric and the offence-specific factors, I was of the view that the indicative sentencing range was up to 1 month’s imprisonment and a fine up to $100,000 and the starting point was 2 weeks’ imprisonment . I noted that as indicated in _Masui_ at \[263\], particularly Figure 11, the _Romel_ category 1 may attract a custodial sentence.

63     Having determined the indicative starting sentence, I was of the view that it was not appropriate to also impose a fine in view of the Prosecution’s intention to apply for a confiscation order under the CDSA against the Accused.

64     Next, I considered the offender-specific factors which did not directly relate to the commission of the offence in question. I noted that there was no remorse shown by the accused. With due respect to counsel, I disagreed that the Accused should be considered as a first-time offender. In my view, having read the lower court’s judgment in _PP v Goh Chan Chong <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 210</span>_ (“**_Goh Chan Chong_**”) where the Accused was convicted of 2 similar corruption charges as stated at \[52\] above and which involved the same development, namely The Rochester, and one Suhaimi (an employee of UED), I was of the view that the Accused was a serial offender. In that case, having regard to the one transaction rule, he was sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $50,000 per charge. The global sentence was 12 weeks’ imprisonment and $100,000. This was an offender-specific aggravating factor and fortified my view that a custodial sentence was warranted. On the other hand, I was of the view that there were no offender-specific factors that warranted a significant discount in sentencing.

65     I noted that the said Suhaimi had pleaded guilty for receiving 2 bribes of $50,000 each from the Accused and he was sentenced to pay a fine of $60,000 for one single proceeded charge. Suhaimi had returned all the bribe money before he was sentenced. See _Goh Chan Chong_ at \[221\].

66     In respect of the precedents cited by the Defence at \[21\] and \[22\] of the Accused’s sentencing submission dated10 August 2021, I was of the view that they were clearly distinguishable on the facts in that the loss to UE group and the benefit to the Accused were very significant.

## Conclusion

67     In the circumstances, on account of the fact that the Accused was a serial offender, a sentence of more than 2 weeks’ imprisonment would be warranted.

68     However, having regard to the principle of parity in sentencing and the facts of the case, I moderated the sentence to 2 weeks’ imprisonment. I noted that in _Goh Chan Chong_, the present Accused was sentenced to a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment and $100,000 fine, in default 24 weeks’ imprisonment. In _Goh Chan Chong_, the amount of bribe was larger and the benefits were greater than this case. In the present case, I noted that it was the Accused who had actively sought out the employees of UED to participate in the tainted transaction for his own personal gain.

69     Considering the fact that Faizal was sentenced to a fine, the fact that the Accused was a serial offender and the more active role played by him compared to Faizal, I was of the view that a custodial sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate and not crushing on the Accused. This was also consistent with the _Masui_ framework.

70     The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
