Land – Strata Titles – Meetings

Probate and Administration – Devolution on Legal Representatives

28 December 2020

### Ditrict Judge Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

1       The Applicants are the executors of the estate (“Estate”) of Cheong Kim Koek, deceased (“Deceased”). The Deceased passed away on 19 July 2013. His will provided for the Applicants to be executors of the Estate. Probate was obtained on 28 October 2013. The Deceased owned Unit 53 (“Property”) located in a mixed 2-storey residential and commercial development (“Development”) at Upper East Coast Road managed by the 1st Respondent (“MCST”). The Development consists of four commercial units on the ground floor and four residential units on the second floor. At the material times, the 2nd and 3rd Respondents were the only council members of the MCST.

2       The Applicants commenced the OS seeking a number of reliefs. Broadly speaking, the reliefs related to two issues: the Applicants’ right to represent the Estate in matters relating to the Property, in particular to represent the Estate in general meetings of the MCST and in obtaining documents from the MCST; and the MCST’s right to remove certain fixtures on the Property and surrounding common property. The specific reliefs sought in the OS were:

> (a)     That the annual general meeting (“AGM”) held on 13 December 2019 (“2019 AGM”) along with all motions purportedly passed during the 2019 AGM be invalidated pursuant to Sections 103 and 104 of the Building and Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C, 2008 Rev Ed) (“BMSMA”) for failure to provide sufficient notice and/or on the basis that the Applicants’ right to vote at the 2019 AGM has been improperly denied;

> (b)     That the court declares that the Applicants, as executors and trustees of the Estate, be entitled to act for and represent the Estate on all matters pertaining to the Estate’s assets including but not limited to the Property;

> (c)     That the court declares that all amounts claimed by the MCST against the Applicants for legal costs, costs of removing fixtures and installations belonging to the Estate and the late payment interest, is wrongful, along with an order that all monies paid under protest be repaid to the Applicants;

> (d)     That the court declares that the late payment interest of 30% per annum imposed by the MCST is exorbitant and unconscionable;

> (e)     That the MCST produces to the Applicants all records and/or documents under the MCST’s control pursuant to Sections 47 and 113 of BMSMA;

> (f)     Damages; and

> (g)     Costs of the application to be paid by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents personally to the Applicants on an indemnity basis.

3       The Respondents have several counterclaims. They seek a declaration that certain minutes of the MCST’s council meeting held on 23 April 2004 and 24 May 2004 (collectively, the “2004 Minutes”) are forged, a mandatory injunction that the Applicants remove and rectify certain fixtures from the Property and a declaration that the Applicants are not entitled to do any works in respect of the Property until a transmission of the Property is done. This last counterclaim in effect raises the same issues in the OS in that it requires a consideration of the Applicants’ right to represent the Estate in matters relating to the Property.

4       It is fair to say that the OS was in large part precipitated by the contentious 2019 AGM. The Respondents did not allow the Applicants to vote in the 2019 AGM, on the basis that the Property has not been properly transmitted from the Deceased to the Applicants, pursuant to the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”). There was also an important extraordinary general meeting (“EOGM”) held on 23 November 2018 (“2018 EOGM”). There are several other events of note, specifically the MCST’s removal of certain fixtures from the Property and surrounding common property in January and February 2019 (“2019 Fixtures Removal”). I will also need to refer to other ancillary proceedings, namely DC/OSS 232/2018, which was converted to DC/DC 2809/2019 (“DC 2809”), DC/DC 1511/2019 (“DC 1511”) and HC/OS 682/2029 (“OS 682”). DC 2809 has been withdrawn. OS 682 was dismissed, but an appeal has been filed.

5       Parties have filed a total of 18 affidavits. Where necessary I will discuss the facts when I discuss the specific issues.

6       I consider the following to be the issues that I have to determine:

> (a)     Whether I possessed the jurisdiction to grant the reliefs in the OS;

> (b)     Whether the court’s finding on standing in OS 682 is binding on me;

> (c)     Whether the Applicants had standing to attend, vote and appoint a proxy at the 2019 AGM, and if so, whether the 2019 AGM along with all motions passed at the AGM should be invalidated;

> (d)     Whether the Applicants had standing to request inspection of documents in the MCST’s custody or control pursuant to Section 47(1) of BMSMA;

> (e)     Whether the MSCT was wrong to have undertaken the 2019 Fixtures Removal and if so, whether the sum of $6,276 paid by the Applicants to the MCST under protest should be repaid;

> (f)     Whether the late payment interest of 30% levied by the MCST is unenforceable; and

> (g)     Whether a mandatory injunction should be granted for the removal of the rest of the Fixtures.

7       On 24 November 2020, I issued oral grounds, broadly in the manner set out in these grounds of decision. I granted the OS in part, but also found that the adjudication of several claims and counterclaims required the resolution of intensely factual matters that were not suited for adjudication via an originating summons action, and that they were to proceed via writ action. After issuing my oral grounds, I asked parties to submit on the specific orders that I should make in relation to the resolution of those claims and counterclaims. As parties were broadly of the view that no specific orders were required, I did not grant any specific directions, save that the claims and counterclaims are to be resolved via writ action otherwise than through the OS.

8       I also asked parties for costs submissions after I issued my oral grounds. After hearing parties, I fixed costs at $8,000 (all in) to be paid by the Respondents to the Appellants. The Respondents are liable jointly and severally for the costs. Pursuant to Section 87 of BMSMA, I also ordered that in respect of costs which the MCST will be paying, if the MCST is levying contributions on the subsidiary proprietors to pay those costs, the contributions are to be levied on all subsidiary proprietors save for the Applicants.

9       The Respondents have filed HC/RAS 32/2020 and HC/RAS 36/2020 and appealed against my decision.

## Whether I possessed the jurisdiction to grant the reliefs in the OS

10     In its written submissions and at the hearing before me on 16 October 2020, the Respondents raised, for the first time, that I did not possess jurisdiction to grant the reliefs in the OS. The Respondents argued that the value of the Property likely exceeded $250,000. Since the OS seeks relief in respect of the Property (amongst other things), the Respondents argued that the OS sought relief in respect of a subject matter (the Property) that exceeded the District Court monetary jurisdiction.

11     I did not agree with the Respondents’ submission. Sections 2 and 19(4) of the State Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCA”) provide for the following:

> **Interpretation**

> **2**.    In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —

>> “District Court limit” means $250,000 or such other amount as may be specified by an order under section 30;

>> …

> **General civil jurisdiction**

> **19.**—(1)    A District Court exercising civil jurisdiction shall be a court of record.

> …

> (4)    Subject to sections 22 and 23, a District Court’s jurisdiction under subsection (2) shall not include jurisdiction to hear and try any action where —

>> (a)    the amount claimed in the action exceeds the District Court limit; or

>> (**b**)     **any remedy or relief sought in the action is in respect of a subject-matter the value of which exceeds the District Court limit.** \[emphasis in bold added\]

12     In the first place, the different reliefs in the OS have to be considered separately, and they cannot be lumped together which was the approach the Respondents took. Looking at the reliefs, only the second relief explicitly refers to the Property. The other substantive reliefs deal with the nullification of the motions passed in the 2019 AGM, the recovery of certain sums paid by the Applicants to the MCST (which can be quantified and does not exceed $250,000) and a declaration that the imposition of late interest at 30% per annum was unenforceable (again, a sum that can be quantified and does not exceed $250,000).

13     In my view, the “subject-matter” of the second relief sought in the OS is _not_ the Property. Just because the Property is referred to in the second relief, it does not follow that the Property is the subject matter. Rather, the “subject-matter” is the Applicants’ _right_ to represent the Estate in matters concerning the Property. Whilst it is hard to quantify the value of such a right, there is no evidence before me that suggests that the right is worth more than $250,000.

14     I consider my interpretation of “subject-matter” in Section 19(4)(b) of the SCA to be in line with the approach taken by the court in _Tuan Kong Beo (Teochew) Temple v Tian Kong Buddhist Temple_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 99</span>. In that case, the plaintiff wanted the defendant to comply with an agreement parties had signed regulating the use of a property used for religious services. The land was leased by the Government to an association run by both parties for a 30-year period at the cost of $650,000. The plaintiff sought an order compelling the defendant not to obstruct the use of the land. The defendant argued that since the value of the lease was $650,000, that exceeded the District Court’s monetary jurisdiction. Deputy Registrar Patrick Tay had to consider whether this was correct. He reviewed Section 19(4) of the SCA and a number of analogous authorities (since it appeared there were no reported cases that had interpreted this provision). I agree with DR Patrick Tay’s holdings at \[16\] and \[20\], as follows:

> … in ascertaining the value of the remedy or relief sought by the Plaintiff in the Suit, it is necessary to identify with precision the subject of the action before the District Court.

> …

> I do not accept that simply because the Suit is an action for a relief relating to the Premises without any pleaded alternative for monetary compensation, the value of the subject-matter for which relief is sought is the consideration of $650,000 paid for the (whole) Lease thereof. It cannot be that a claim to any use of the Premises, however minimal in duration, should be valued the same as a claim to the entirety of a 30-year lease of the same.

15     DR Patrick Tay held that the subject-matter of the suit was the _use_ of the property, and not the property _per se_. Although it was somewhat difficult to quantify the value of the use of the property, DR Patrick Tay concluded that it was nevertheless well within the District Court limit.

16     Similarly, I concluded that the “subject-matter” of the second relief was the Applicants’ _right_ to represent the Estate in matters concerning the Property, and not the Property itself. The Respondents did not produce any evidence that the value of this right would exceed the District Court limit.

17     The Respondents however argued that the scope of the second relief was very wide and extended to a declaration that the Applicants were entitled to act for and represent the Estate “on _all_ matters pertaining to the Estate’s assets including but not limited to \[the Property\].” I agree that the second relief as sought is too wide. If I found that the Applicants could represent the Estate on matters dealing with the Property, it would not be proper for me to grant the relief as sought and I would accordingly grant a much narrower relief, restricted to the disputed issues raised in the OS.

## Whether the court’s decision on standing in OS 682 is binding on me

18     OS 682 was commenced by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in the High Court for a declaration that the 1st Applicant was not entitled to bring a magistrate’s complaint against them. The 1st Applicant had filed the magistrate’s complaint because of the removal of fixtures on the Property and the common property by the MCST which the 1st Applicant says was an act of mischief. OS 682 was dismissed by Chan Seng Onn J and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents have filed an appeal. Chan J has not yet issued his grounds of decision and so the specific reasons for OS 682’s dismissal are not evident. Nevertheless, what is clear is that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents raised the very same arguments on standing in both OS 682 and this OS. The issue is whether Chan J’s dismissal of OS 682 meant that he accepted that the Applicants had the requisite standing and if so, whether that finding is binding on me.

19     Although Chan J has not issued his grounds of decision, it seemed to me that the dismissal of OS 682 would necessarily entail a finding that the Applicants had the standing to file the magistrate’s complaint. The parties have not argued otherwise.

20     Parties diverged slightly however on whether such a finding was binding on me. The Applicants argued that Chan J’s finding is binding on me and effectively decided the standing issue in their favour. The Respondents argued that whilst both this OS and OS 682 dealt broadly with the same issue, namely, the Applicants’ standing to represent the Estate in matters relating to the Property, the specific issues in the respective originating summonses were different. In OS 682, the specific issue was the Applicants’ standing to file a magistrate’s complaint in relation to the Property whilst in this OS the specific issue was the Applicants’ standing to participate in the 2019 AGM and seek documents from the MCST. Because of this difference, the Respondents argued that whilst Chan J’s finding may be relevant, it is not necessarily binding on me.

21     I am inclined to agree with the Respondents’ position. As the issues are not exactly the same, even if the arguments made are similar, the findings in OS 682 would not necessarily bind me. They are still relevant; but in the absence of Chan J’s grounds of decision, it is difficult for me to determine Chan J’s reasoning on the standing issue. In any event, in light of my conclusion that the Applicants have standing, this was not a critical point.

22     Before leaving this point, I should mention that the Respondents had urged that I adjourn the hearing of the OS until after the appeal in OS 682 had been disposed off. The request was made on the basis that the Court of Appeal’s finding on standing would have an impact on my decision on standing. I declined to adjourn the hearing of the OS. The OS was filed on 21 January 2020 and the hearing took place almost 9 months later, on 16 October 2020. The appeal against Chan J’s decision had just been filed. Chan J’s grounds of decision had not yet been released and it was unclear when it would be released. Even applying the most optimistic of timelines, the appeal is not likely to be heard until the second quarter of 2021. That would mean that if the OS was adjourned pending the Court of Appeal’s decision, the OS at the earliest would only be heard in the third quarter of 2021. That is too long a delay, especially considering that pending the resolution of the OS, the MCST has so far taken a rather uncompromising position and has not only barred the Applicants from participating in any general meeting but has even refused to communicate with them. Since delaying the OS would have a significant impact on the Applicants’ ability to exercise their rights as the owner of the Property, I did not think it was just to delay the determination of the OS.

## Whether the Applicants had standing to attend, vote and appoint a proxy at the 2019 AGM, and if so, whether the 2019 AGM along with all motions passed at the AGM should be nullified

23     In my view, this issue is to be determined by asking two questions. First, what is the nature of the Applicants’ interest in the Property, and second whether that interest gave the Applicants standing to participate in the 2019 AGM, or were they prohibited from doing so without first effecting a transmission of the Property?

24     I find that once the Deceased passed away, his assets, including the Property, vested in the Applicants. Effectively, they stepped into the shoes of the Deceased and could exercise all rights in relation to the Property. Specifically, they were entitled to participate in the MCST’s general meetings, including the 2019 AGM. There is nothing in the BMSMA, Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”) or the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LTSA”) which prohibited them from doing so without first effecting a transmission of the Property.

### The Applicants’ interest in the Property as executors of the Estate

25     I begin with the uncontroversial proposition that upon the death of a testator, his properties are vested in the executors of his will such that in respect of immovable properties for example, there is no break or hiatus in the title. Furthermore, the executors derive their powers from the will and not from the grant of probate, so that an action can be commenced without the grant though the grant of probate is needed before a formal order in the action is made. These principles are clear from _Re Ong Soon Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 380</span> at \[2\], \[4\] and \[5\]:

> 2    Where the owner of any property has made a testamentary disposition, namely, a will, and has named an executor, though it remains ambulatory while he is alive, upon his death it becomes a declaration of his intentions as to how his properties are to be dealt with. More importantly it vests his properties in his executors upon his death. In respect of immovable properties the will, so to speak, is a species of conveyance. In the result, the executor derives his authority and title from the will and is entitled to assert his power according to the terms and tenor of the will. There is no hiatus in the title. Title is kept alive and continuous by the act of the owner, namely, the will-maker.

> …

> 4    In consequence of what has been stated above, an executor acquires recognition of his same powers and status from the moment of the death of the testator even though he has not obtained probate…In other words, an executor appointed by the will is entitled to describe himself so, the moment the will acquires force and effect upon the death of its maker…

> 5 … (a)    The title of an executor derives his title from the will and speaks from the will and not the grant of probate. The executor may, therefore, act and commence an action at any time after the death of the testator but he cannot maintain the action and proceed beyond the stage at which it becomes necessary to prove his title because probate is the only proof of the title of executor. The stage at which the executor has to prove his title is the hearing at which a formal order will be made.

### Whether any statutory provisions imposed on the Applicants an obligation to effect a transmission of the Property

26     I next deal with various provisions in BMSMA, LTA and LTSA which the Respondents have relied on.

#### BMSMA provisions

##### Section 46(3)(b) of BMSMA

27     The Respondents first pointed to Section 46(3)(b) of BMSMA, which is as follows:

> (3)    The management corporation shall record the following information on a page of the strata roll relating to the lot to which the information relates:

>> …

>> (b)    the name of the subsidiary proprietor as shown on the folio of the subsidiary strata land-register comprising the lot, and an address within Singapore for the service of notices on the subsidiary proprietor of that lot

28     The Respondents argued that the Applicants are not subsidiary proprietors and therefore not entitled to have their names reflected in the strata roll, until the Property has been transmitted. I do not think that Section 46(3) of BMSMA tells us anything about whether the Applicants can participate in the 2019 AGM, whether with or without a transmission. I am inclined to conclude that if on the death of the Deceased, the Applicants step into his shoes and title to the Property is vested to the Applicants, they should be entitled to all rights attached to the Property, including the right to participate in a general meeting, and they should therefore be considered to effectively be “subsidiary proprietors.” The Respondents’ interpretation would mean that the “subsidiary proprietor” remains the Deceased, and yet the Deceased no longer exists and cannot exercise any of the rights which the BMSMA or other legislation grants to a “subsidiary proprietor”. It also does not sufficiently account for the clear position at law, as set out in _Re Ong Soon Chuan_, that the Property is vested to the Applicants on the Deceased’s death.

##### Paragraph 2 of the First Schedule of BMSMA

29     The Respondents pointed to Paragraph 2 of the First Schedule of the BMSMA, which is as follows:

> **Persons entitled to vote at general meetings**

> 2.—(1)    A person shall be entitled to vote in respect of any lot on any proposal submitted at a general meeting of a management corporation or on any election of members of the council, or at a general meeting of a subsidiary management corporation or on any election of its executive committee, only if —

>> (a)    in the case of a management corporation, he is the subsidiary proprietor or a mortgagee in possession or a receiver of that lot as shown on the strata roll and has paid to the management corporation all contributions and any other moneys levied or recoverable by the management corporation under this Act; or

>> (b)    in the case of a subsidiary management corporation, he is the subsidiary proprietor (or a mortgagee in possession or a receiver) of a lot who is a member of that subsidiary management corporation and has paid to the subsidiary management corporation all contributions and any other moneys levied or recoverable by the subsidiary management corporation under this Act.

30     The BMSMA specifies that “subsidiary proprietor” has the same meaning as in the LTSA. The LTSA defines “subsidiary proprietor” as follows:

> (a)    the registered subsidiary proprietor for the time being of the entire estate in a lot including an estate for life, an estate in remainder or an estate in reversion; and

> (b)    in relation to a lot where a lease has been granted, the registered subsidiary proprietor for the time being of a leasehold interest in a lot described in an instrument of lease whose unexpired term is not less than 21 years as from the date of lodgment of the instrument of lease for registration with the Registrar including such a lease registered prior to 1st December 1987

31     The Respondents argued that the Applicants were not “registered subsidiary proprietors…as shown on the strata roll” and therefore not entitled to attend and vote at the MCST’s general meetings.

32     Based on the principles in _Re Ong Soon Chuan_, title to the Property is transmitted to the Applicants on the death of the Deceased. Consequently, the Applicants step into the shoes of the Deceased. If before the Deceased died, he was the “registered subsidiary proprietors…as shown on the strata roll” then after his death, the Applicants who step into his shoes should logically become the “registered subsidiary proprietors…as shown on the strata roll.” Whilst the strata roll would list “Cheong Kim Koek” as the registered subsidiary proprietor, given his death and his will, I do not see any logical impediment with the Applicants being considered to be the registered subsidiary proprietors for the purposes of Paragraph 2 of the First Schedule of the BMSMA since they have stepped into the shoes of the Deceased.

33     The Respondents’ position would mean that the “subsidiary proprietor” remained the Deceased, and yet the Deceased no longer exists and cannot exercise any of the rights which the law grants to a “subsidiary proprietor”. I find this to be illogical. It also does not sufficiently account for the clear position at law, as set out in _Re Ong Soon Chuan_, that the Property is vested to the Applicants on the Deceased’s death.

34     I should mention that the Applicants argued that Paragraph 2(5) of the First Schedule of BMSMA granted them the right to attend and vote at general meetings of the MCST:

> A subsidiary proprietor who is the trustee of a lot shall, subject to this Schedule, be entitled to cast a vote on any proposal submitted at a general meeting of —

>> (a)    a management corporation or on any election of members of the council; or

>> (b)    a subsidiary management corporation or on any election of its executive committee,

> and the persons beneficially interested in the trust shall not be entitled to cast such a vote.

35     The Applicants argued that since they are trustees of the Estate (in addition to being executors), they were entitled to vote and attend general meetings of the MCST. Whilst I agree that the Applicants are trustees of the Estate, I am not sure Paragraph 2(5) of the First Schedule of BMSMA assists the Applicants. This is because it applies where the “subsidiary proprietor” is a trustee. I have already held that the “subsidiary proprietor” should be construed as referring to the Applicants. But if I had held that the “subsidiary proprietor” was the Deceased unless and until transmission of the Property had been effected, then Paragraph 2(5) does not assist the Applicants as the “subsidiary proprietor” i.e., the Deceased, is not the trustee.

#### LTA provisions

36     The Respondents pointed to a number of provisions in the LTA, arguing that they established that registration is needed to pass any estate or interest in land. In my view these provisions are either not applicable, or simply stipulates what happens when a title is properly transmitted – namely that the registration provides for indefeasibility of title and priority. The provisions do not establish the far wider proposition, that no title or interest passes without registration.

##### Section 36 of LTA

37     I start with Section 36 of LTA, which is as follows:

> **Land-register as evidence**

> **36.**—(1)    Every manual folio duly authenticated under the hand and seal of the Registrar shall —

>> (a)    be received in all courts as evidence of the particulars therein set forth and that the land therein comprised has been duly brought under the provisions of this Act; and

>> (b)    be conclusive evidence that the person named as proprietor therein or in any memorial thereon is, or was at the relevant time, entitled to the estate or interest in the land therein specified and described.

> (2)    A print-out of a computer folio issued by the Registrar and bearing a facsimile of the Registrar’s seal shall —

>> (a)    be received in all courts as evidence of the particulars therein set forth; and

>> (b)    be conclusive evidence that the land therein comprised has been duly brought under the provisions of this Act and that the person named as proprietor therein or in any memorial thereon is, or was at the relevant time, entitled to the estate or interest in the land therein specified and described

> (3)    Where, in a manual folio or a print-out of a computer folio, the estate or interest of a registered proprietor is expressed to be subject to —

>> (a)    an estate or interest evidenced by an instrument;

>> (b)    a provision of an instrument; or

>> (c)    an enumerated provision of any Act,

> the whole of the contents of that instrument, provision or enumerated provision, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be set forth at length in the folio or print-out.

> (4)    Where a copy of a manual folio duly certified by the Registrar as a true copy or a print-out of a computer folio issued by the Registrar and bearing a facsimile of the Registrar’s seal is before a court in any action or suit, it shall have the same value in evidence as the original folio.

> (5)    Where the Registrar is required by law to produce at any place or to any person a computer folio, he shall comply with that requirement by issuing a print-out of the computer folio and by causing the print-out to be produced at that place or to that person.

38     The Respondents argued that the land register is conclusive evidence that the person named as the proprietor is entitled to the estate or interest in the land. I agree with that proposition. However, it does not tell us what happens when the proprietor no longer exists because he is deceased. Surely when the proprietor is deceased, it is somewhat illogical to say that he _remains_ the proprietor. Bearing in mind the general position in law that a testator’s assets are vested to his executors on his death, it seems to me more logical to say that on the testator’s death, his executors become the proprietor.

##### Section 45 of LTA

39     The Respondents then referred to Section 45 of LTA, which is as follows:

> **Instruments ineffectual until registered**

> **45.**—(1)    No instrument until registered as in this Act provided is effectual to pass any estate or interest in land under the provisions of this Act.

>> (2)    Upon registration of an instrument the estate or interest therein specified shall pass, or the land shall become liable as security for the payment of money (as the case may be), subject to such covenants and conditions as are set forth in the instrument and are capable of taking effect, and subject to such covenants and conditions as are by law declared to be implied in instruments of a like nature.

>> (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing any unregistered instrument from operating as a contract.

>> (4)    This section shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of any written law for the compulsory acquisition or other statutory vesting of land.

40     I would first observe that Sections 45 to 49 of LTA are located in Part V and Division 1 of LTA, which is titled “Effect of Registration” and “Indefeasibility and priority” respectively. That gives a clue as to the general objective of these provisions.

41     Moving to Section 45 of LTA, I do not think it has any application to our facts. This is because the Deceased’s will is not an “instrument” as defined in the LTA. I say this for three reasons. _First_, the LTA defines “instrument” as including “a transfer, lease, mortgage, transmission application, charge and any other application, or any other document in writing relating to any disposition, devolution or acquisition of land or any claim to or vesting of interest in land”. As explained by _Re Ong Soon Chuan_, a testator’s will remains ambulatory whilst he is alive, but on his death, his assets are divested to his executors. Even though the court in _Re Ong Soon Chuan_ recognised that the divestiture of assets on the testator’s death “so to speak…is a species of conveyance,” I do not think a will can fairly be described to be of the same _genus_ as “a transfer, lease, mortgage, transmission application or charge”. It appears to me that a will is a _sui generis_ document and that the divesture of assets pursuant to a will occurs by operation of law.

42      _Second_, based on the list of forms available at the website of the Singapore Land Authority, there is no form providing for the registration of a will. The only forms available when there is a death are the transmission application and a notice of death.

43      _Third_, if a will is an “instrument” under the LTA that has to be registered before it is effective to pass any interest in land, that would contradict the general position at law that a testator’s assets vests to his executors upon his death (as explained in _Re Ong Soon Chuan_). I do not think that Section 45 of LTA can be read as overturning such an established legal position unless it is clear.

##### Section 46 of LTA

44     The Respondents also referred to Section 46 of LTA, which is as follows:

> **Estate of proprietor paramount**

> **46.**—(1)    Notwithstanding —

>> (a)    the existence in any other person of any estate or interest, whether derived by grant from the State or otherwise, which but for this Act might be held to be paramount or to have priority;

>> (b)    any failure to observe the procedural requirements of this Act; and

>> (c)    any lack of good faith on the part of the person through whom he claims,

> any person who becomes the proprietor of registered land, whether or not he dealt with a proprietor, shall hold that land free from all encumbrances, liens, estates and interests except such as may be registered or notified in the land-register, but subject to —

>> (i)    any subsisting exceptions, reservations, covenants and conditions, contained or implied in the State title thereof;

>> (ii)   any subsisting easement or public right of way which was in existence at the date on which the land was brought under the provisions of this Act and any right on, above or under any land created before or after 1st March 1994 in favour of a public authority under any statute and any statutory easement implied under sections 98, 99, 101, 102 and 104 and section 3C of the State Lands Act (Cap. 314);

>> (iii)   any statutory obligation as defined in section 142;

>> (iv)   the power to correct errors conferred on the Registrar by section 159;

>> (v)    the power to rectify the land-register conferred upon the court by section 160;

>> (vi)   the rights of any person in occupation of the land under a tenancy when the proprietor became registered as such, being a tenancy the term of which does not exceed 7 years and could not have been extended by exercise of the option of renewal to exceed an aggregate of 7 years; and

>> (vii)  the power conferred on the court to make a declaration in respect of any transfer or an order to rectify the land-register and the power conferred on the Registrar to suspend or cancel the registration of the transfer and any related instrument by section 24 of the Residential Property Act (Cap. 274) in respect of any residential property (the expressions “transfer” and “residential property” to have the meanings assigned by that Act).

> (2)    Nothing in this section shall be held to prejudice the rights and remedies of any person —

>> (a)    to have the registered title of a proprietor defeated on the ground of fraud or forgery to which that proprietor or his agent was a party or in which he or his agent colluded;

>> (b)    to enforce against a proprietor any contract to which that proprietor was a party;

>> (c)    to enforce against a proprietor who is a trustee the provisions of the trust;

>> (d)    to recover from a proprietor land acquired by him from a person under a legal disability which was known to the proprietor at the time of dealing; or

>> (e)    to recover from a proprietor land which has been unlawfully acquired by him in purported exercise of a statutory power or authority.

> (3)    Nothing in this section shall confer on a proprietor claiming otherwise than as a purchaser any better title than was held by his immediate predecessor.

> (4)    For the purposes of subsection (1), “public authority” includes any corporation sole or body corporate incorporated under any written law.

45     The Respondents’ argument appeared to be that notwithstanding that title to the Property has vested to the Applicants on the Deceased’s death by virtue of the Deceased’s will, the Applicants’ interest in the Property does not have priority over the Deceased’s interest. I am afraid I have some difficulty accepting the logic of this argument. There is no issue of indefeasibility or priority of interests that arises on the facts. The Deceased may still be listed as the registered proprietor but his title to the Property has passed to the Applicants upon his death. The Deceased no longer has any interest in the Property and I find it difficult to accept that he has an interest simply by virtue of him being identified as the registered proprietor. There is therefore no competition in title and no issue of priority or indefeasibility arises.

46     In any event, Section 46 of LTA does not tell us anything about the specific issue I have to decide, which is whether the Applicants can participate in the MCST’s general meetings without first making an application for transmission. What Section 46 provides for is the indefeasibility and priority of a registered proprietor.

##### Section 47 of LTA

47     The Respondents also relied on Section 47 of LTA, which is as follows:

> **Exoneration from effect of notice**

> 47.—(1)    Except in the case of fraud, no person dealing with a proprietor or with a person who is entitled to become a proprietor shall be required or in any manner concerned —

>> (a)    to inquire or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the current proprietor or any previous proprietor is or was registered;

>> (b)    to see to the application of the purchase money or any part thereof; or

>> (c)    to be affected by notice (actual or constructive) of any trust or other unregistered interest, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.

> (2)    For the purpose of subsection (1), the knowledge that any unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.

> (3)    The protection afforded by this section shall commence at the date of the contract or other instrument evidencing such dealing.

> (4)    Section 15(2) and (3) of the Trustees Act (Cap. 337) shall not apply to any dealing by a proprietor of registered land.

48     The Respondents argued that they should be entitled to rely on the fact that the Deceased is still listed as the proprietor of the Property, and that if they permitted anyone other than the Deceased to participate in the 2019 AGM, they would not be afforded the protections under Section 47. The Respondents’ reliance on Section 47 is misplaced. This is because the Respondents’ act of allowing or disallowing the Applicants to participate in the 2019 AGM is not a “dealing” under Section 47. “Dealing” under the LTA is defined as “any instrument other than a certificate of title or caveat which is registrable or capable of being made registrable under the provisions of \[LTA\] or in respect of which any entry or notification in the land-register is by \[LTA\] required or permitted to be made”. Quite simply, even if the Applicants had effected transmission of the Property such that they were now listed as proprietors, and the Respondents allowed them to participate in the 2019 AGM, the Respondents would not be entitled to the protections afforded by Section 47.

##### Sections 107, 108 and 113 of LTA

49     Next, the Respondents drew my attention to Sections 107, 108 and 113 of LTA, which are as follows:

> **Transmission on death of proprietors in severalty**

> **107.**—(1)    Personal representatives or any other person claiming land of a deceased proprietor may apply in the approved form to become registered as proprietors by transmission of the land, and upon proof of their representation or claim, the Registrar shall enter on the folio a memorial of registration in accordance with section 37.

> (2)    An application under this section by a person claiming land of a deceased proprietor otherwise than as personal representative shall not be registered unless it can be established to the satisfaction of the Registrar that a transfer to that person by the personal representative is not reasonably practicable.

> (3)    The Registrar may, in his discretion, register a transmission application by the Public Trustee acting in his capacity under section 6 of the Public Trustee Act (Cap. 260) in the administration of an estate in respect of which representation has not been taken out.

> (4)    For the purposes of this section, “personal representative” includes —

>> (a)    the administrator of an executor; and

>> (b)    the executor of an administrator.

> **Dealings without transmission**

> **108**.    Upon production of the grant of probate of the will or letters of administration of the estate of a deceased proprietor, the Registrar may, without requiring a transmission application, register —

>> (a)    any transfer by the personal representative expressed to be made —

>>> (i)    in pursuance of a devise in the will of the proprietor;

>>> (ii)   in exercise of a power of appropriation of the assets of the proprietor;

>>> (iii)   in pursuance of an appointment of new trustees of the proprietor;

>>> (iv) by way of distribution under the intestacy of the proprietor; or

>>> (v) in pursuance of a contract entered into by the proprietor in his lifetime;

>> (b)    a discharge of a mortgage or charge of which the deceased person was the proprietor; and

>> (c)    a surrender of a lease of which the deceased person was the proprietor.

> **Effect of transmission**

> **113**.    On registration of any transmission application in accordance with this Part —

>> (a)    the estate and interest of the former proprietor, as set forth in the land-register, together with all easements, rights and powers, thereto belonging or appertaining, shall pass to and be vested in the person so registered as proprietor; and

>> (b)    that person shall hold the land in trust for the persons and purposes for which it is applicable by law; but for the purpose of any dealing under the provisions of this Act, and notwithstanding the fact that his description may indicate a fiduciary capacity, he shall be deemed to be the absolute proprietor of the land.

50     The Respondents argued that the effect of these provisions is, firstly, that only after a successful transmission will the Applicants obtain full rights to the Property, including the right to participate in the 2019 AGM. Secondly, Section 108 suggests that without a transmission, the powers of the executors to a property are limited.

51     I am unable to agree with either of these propositions, for the following reasons. Firstly, Section 107 is not mandatory. It states that personal representatives _may_ apply for transmission so that they become registered as proprietors. I am unable to read into Section 107 an obligation that personal representatives must do so.

52     Secondly, Section 108 is not germane, because it talks of “\[d\]ealings without transmission,” i.e., situations where “dealings” would be permitted without a transmission. As I explained above, “dealings” in LTA is defined as “any instrument other than a certificate of title or caveat which is registrable or capable of being made registrable under the provisions of \[LTA\] or in respect of which any entry or notification in the land-register is by \[LTA\] required or permitted to be made”. Whilst Section 108 tells us which “dealings” are permitted without a transmission application, it tells us nothing about whether personal representatives can participate in general meetings of a management corporation.

53     Thirdly, Section 113 simply sets out the effect of a transmission but does not tell us whether personal representatives like the Applicants can participate in a general meeting. To put it another way, Section 113 of LTA does not say that without transmission, those rights cannot be exercised by the personal representatives at all.

54     Fourthly, Section 108 _assumes_ that personal representatives who have been granted probate or letters of administration possess full rights to deal with the property of the deceased, _without_ any transmission. Section 108 states that “\[u\]pon production of the grant of probate of the will or letters of administration of the estate of a deceased proprietor, the Registrar may, without requiring a transmission application, register” various transfers by the personal representatives. Section 108 does not provide that the transfers stipulated in the provision are conditional on the personal representatives having first made a transmission application under Section 107. Furthermore, by allowing the registration of certain transfers, there is an assumption that the personal representatives have full rights to deal with the Property. If as the Respondents argue the Applicants in fact do not have full rights to deal with the Property without first making a transmission application under Section 107, then the Applicants would not be in a position to do any of the transfers set out at Section 108. And yet Section 108 expressly provides that they may do so.

##### Section 132 of LTA

55     The Respondents referred to Section 132 of LTA and argued that the grant of probate would have to be registered failing which it does not bind the Property. Section 132 of the LTA is as follows:

> **Writs and orders not binding unless registered**

> **132.**—(1)    A writ of execution, or an order of court directing, appointing or empowering some person other than the proprietor to sell or otherwise to deal with or dispose of registered land, shall not bind or affect such land until particulars of the writ or order have been entered in the land-register.

> (2)    An entry referred to in subsection (1) shall constitute a memorial of registration within the meaning of section 37.

> (3)    The person seeking registration shall lodge with the Registrar a duly certified copy of the writ or order together with an application indicating the titles in respect of which registration is required.

> (4)    The registration of a writ or an order shall enable the Sheriff or other person named therein to execute instruments registrable in accordance with this Act.

> (5)    A writ shall not be registered unless it has been lodged for registration within 6 months of the date of its issue.

> (6)    Where a writ has been registered then, until its registration has been cancelled in accordance with this Act, a renewal of that writ, or a second or subsequent writ on the same judgment, shall not be registered.

56     I am unable to agree that the Applicants have to register the grant of probate. In the first place, as the court in _Re Ong Soon Chuan_ explained, an executor derives his power and title from the testator’s will. This is unlike a grant of letters of administration, where the administrator derives his power and title from the grant. Since the will is not a “writ of execution, or an order of court”, it does not fall within Section 132, and need not be registered.

57     Additionally, I do not think a grant of probate or a grant of letters of administration are documents which have to be registered pursuant to Section 132 of LTA. Section 132 deals with writs of executions or documents of a similar nature. A grant of probate or grant of letters of administration is not at all in the same _genus_ as writs of execution.

#### Other arguments by the Respondents

58     The Respondents also argued that by allowing the Applicants to exercise any rights in relation to the Property without a transmission and the Applicants being registered proprietors in the land-register, it exposes them to possible claims by third parties such as the Deceased’s beneficiaries. I find this argument to be far-fetched. The Respondents did not explain the nature of the possible claims it could face, or the likelihood of such claims even succeeding. If the concern is of potential claims, even if frivolously made, it is impossible to be protected from such claims. Certainly, it would be wrong to deny the Applicants the right to participate in the MCST’s general meetings if the only reason for doing so is to insulate the MCST from frivolous claims.

59     Furthermore, as I explained at \[48\] above, what the Respondents are prohibiting the Applicants from doing (participating in the MCST’s general meetings) is not a “dealing” under Section 47 of the LTA. Consequently, even if a transmission has been effected, no protection is afforded to the Respondents if they allowed the Applicants to participate in the general meetings. Seen in this way, the Respondents’ concern of possible third-party claims is misconceived.

60     Finally, the Respondents argued, firstly, that if the Applicants are allowed to deal with the Property without a transmission under Section 107, and in particular if they are allowed to participate in the general meetings, it would render Section 107 of LTA otiose. Secondly, that since the process of transmission is not complex or expensive, there is really no reason for the Applicants to refrain from making the transmission application since the grant of probate was granted in 2013.

61     I do not agree with either of these arguments. As to the first argument, the reality is that if the Property is sold, transmission would have to take place first to the Applicants, following which the transfer can be effected from the Applicants to the buyers. It would not be possible to transfer the Property directly to the buyers without first transmitting the Property to the Applicants. I would just add that it is nevertheless possible for the Property to be sold to a buyer without any transmission taking place first but the transfer to the buyer would also not be registered. This would mean that the buyer would have no title to the Property and no indefeasibility or priority against a third party in the event the Property is sold again by the Applicants to a third party. Although I am not sure which buyer would be comfortable with this arrangement, especially given the large sums involved in property transactions, the buyer is not prevented from entering into such an arrangement. Section 45(3) of LTA makes it clear that an unregistered instrument can operate as a contract, which means that the buyer can sue the Applicants in contract. The larger point is that while transmission under Section 107 of LTA could be said to be advisable in many instances, that does not convert Section 107 to a mandatory condition that every personal representative would have to comply with before he can exercise any rights over the property.

62     As for the argument that the transmission process is neither complex nor expensive, I have found that the Applicants have the right to deal with the Property, and that extended to a right to participate in the MCST’s general meetings. I have also found that the legislation does not impose an obligation on the Applicants to effect a transmission before they can exercise those rights. If so, then the fact that the transmission process is neither complex nor expensive does not alter this position so that the Applicants are imposed with such an obligation.

#### Conclusion

63     To conclude, I find that once the Deceased passed away, his assets, including the Property, vested in the Applicants. The Applicants stepped into the shoes of the Deceased and could exercise all rights in relation to the Property. I am unable to agree with the Respondents’ argument that the Applicants are not entitled to deal with the Property, and specifically, that they are not entitled to participate in any of the MCST’s general meetings, until a transmission application is made under Section 107 of LTA. In my view, the transmission application is a procedural or administrative matter and a successful transmission does not grant to the Applicants substantive rights which they otherwise would not have. Equally, the failure to effect transmission does not take away from the Applicants substantive rights which they possessed.

64     I make one final observation about the Respondents’ arguments in relation to the Applicants’ standing. In DC 1511, the MCST and Ms. Sarah Shoba Aroul Stashe Aroul (“Ms Aroul”) (the wife of the 3rd Defendant and one of the subsidiary proprietors of the Development) commenced proceedings against the Applicants, as executors of the Estate. Amongst other things, the MCST complained about certain fixtures in the Property and surrounding common property and sought an injunction for their removal. The MCST commenced DC 1511 on the basis that the Applicants were the proper persons to be sued when it came to issues arising out of the Property. This must necessarily mean that the Applicants had the right to represent the Estate in relation to matters dealing with the Property. DC 1511 was subsequently withdrawn, but I find it interesting that the withdrawal was premised on the proceedings being irregularly commenced as a writ action when under Section 124 of the BSMSA, it should have been commenced as an originating summons. This is what was communicated to the court by counsel for the MCST at two separate hearings on 26 November 2019 and 18 December 2019. At no point in time did counsel for the MCST say that the withdrawal was premised on the Applicants not having standing or not being the proper persons to be sued.

65     It appears to me then that the MCST has been acting inconsistently – whilst in the OS they have argued that the Applicants lacked standing to deal with the Property without first effecting a transmission pursuant to Section 107, in DC 1511 this was not an impediment at all. A less charitable observer might say that the Respondents’ arguments about the Applicants’ lack of standing is not made in good faith and that these arguments about standing are deployed or ignored depending on whether they benefitted the MCST.

66     The Applicants have sought a fairly wide declaration, namely that they are “entitled to act for and represent the Estate on all matters pertaining to the Estate’s assets including but not limited to the \[Property\]”. However, I do not consider it appropriate to make such a wide declaration. The declaratory relief should go no further than the disputed matters in this OS. Hence, I granted the following declaration, that the Applicants, as executors and trustees of the Estate, are entitled to act for and represent the Estate on the following matters in relation to the Property:

> (a)     Commencing this OS in relation to the Property;

> (b)     Participating in any of the MCST’s general meetings, including attending, voting or appointing a proxy in the general meetings; and

> (c)     Communicating with the MCST on all matters in relation to the Property.

### Whether any of the motions passed at the 2019 AGM should be nullified

67     At the 2019 AGM, the Respondents refused to accept the votes of the Applicants’ appointed proxy, Mr Simon Bay, and the proxy for Unit 55 (“Unit 55 Proxy”). The situation with Unit 55 was similar to the Property – the proprietor of Unit 55 had also passed away and Unit 55 was managed by the personal representatives of the deceased’s estate. However, no transmission had been made. The personal representatives of Unit 55 had appointed the Unit 55 Proxy.

68     At the 2019 AGM, a number of motions were passed, some but not all of which had previously been included in the notice and agenda issued by the MCST to the subsidiary proprietors prior to the 2019 AGM (the “2019 Notice”). The motions that were passed by a vote of 2 for to 1 against were as follows:

> (a)     That all costs including legal fees on an indemnity basis, disbursements and incidental costs incurred by the MCST in the recovery of arrears of management fund, sinking fund and special levy contributions and in compelling the subsidiary proprietor(s) to comply with the requirements of the BMSMA, By-Laws and House Rules shall be recoverable from the subsidiary proprietor(s) concerned (“Motion 1”);

> (b)     That interest at the rate of 30% per annum or any rate as determined by the subsidiary proprietors, calculated on a daily basis, be levied if payment for all contributions, interest and other charges due to the MCST are received after 30 days from the due date (“Motion 2”);

> (c)     That the minutes of the 2018 EOGM be amended so as to retrospectively invalidate the attendance and vote of the 1st Applicant at the 2018 EOGM (“Motion 3”);

> (d)     That the MCST’s written consent is required for installation / fixing of pipes, exhaust ducts or any fixtures other than air-con compressors at the ground floor back wall of shop units. Above the shop windows, and the recess areas of the side walls under each respective unit’s windows and the front and back of the building under the windows of the respective residential units and at the walls of the roof terraces of the respective units are common property and permission and shall only be given by the council in general meeting (“Motion 4”); and

> (e)     That the MCST shall not issue any letter of no objection to any of the matters that are not within the purview of the council without a resolution by the council in general meeting (“Motion 5”).

69     Out of these five motions, only the first two, namely Motions 1 and 2, were included in the 2019 Notice.

70     The Applicants argued that each of the 5 motions should be nullified, on the following grounds:

> (a)     14 days’ notice of the 2019 AGM was not provided as required under paragraph 1(1) of the First Schedule of the BMSMA;

> (b)     In respect of Motions 3, 4 and 5, notice of the motions were not given in advance at all;

> (c)     In respect of all of the motions, if the Applicants’ proxy Mr Simon Bay had been allowed to vote, none of the motions would have passed.

#### Whether 14 days’ notice of the 2019 AGM was provided

71     I deal first with the Applicants’ argument that 14 days’ notice of the 2019 AGM was not provided. Paragraph 1(1) of the First Schedule of the BMSMA provides as follows:

> **Notice of general meetings**

> 1.—(1)    Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, notice of a general meeting of a management corporation or subsidiary management corporation shall be served on each subsidiary proprietor who is a member thereof and on the first mortgagee of a lot, as ascertained from the strata roll, at least 14 days before the meeting.

72     The Applicants say that although the letter from the MCST containing the 2019 Notice was dated 28 November 2019, it was only posted on 29 November 2019 and received by the Applicants by post on 2 December 2019. In order for the 2019 AGM to be able to proceed on 13 December 2019, the subsidiary proprietors should have received (or be deemed to have received) the 2019 Notice by 28 November 2019.

73     The Respondents submitted that the requisite 14 days’ notice had been provided, but that in any event, no prejudice was suffered by the Applicants as they were able to attend the 2019 AGM. They referred me to Section 103(2) of BMSMA:

> **Order to invalidate proceedings**

> 103.—(1)    Where, pursuant to an application by a subsidiary proprietor or first mortgagee of a lot, a Board considers that the provisions of this Act have not been complied with in relation to a meeting of the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation, or a council or executive committee, the Board may, by order —

>> (a)    invalidate any resolution of, or election held by, the persons present at the meeting; or

>> (b)    refuse to invalidate any such resolution or election.

> (2)    A Board shall not make an order under subsection (1) refusing to invalidate a resolution or election unless it considers —

>> (a)    that the failure to comply with the provisions of this Act did not prejudicially affect any person; and

>> (b)    that compliance with the provisions of this Act would not have resulted in a failure to pass the resolution, or have affected the result of the election, as the case may be.

74     My view is that there is arguably a breach of Paragraph 1(1) of the First Schedule of BMSMA as the 2019 Notice was not _served_ at least 14 days before the 2019 AGM. The recipients must receive (or be deemed to receive) the 2019 Notice at least 14 days before the 2019 AGM, which would be 28 November 2019 at the latest. However, even though the 2019 Notice was dated 28 November 2019, it was only posted out on 29 November 2019 and therefore less than 14 days’ notice was provided.

75     However, I did not consider that the breach prejudiced the Applicants. They ultimately attended the 2019 AGM. The 2019 Notice was late by one or two days, which is not significant. The Applicants were also unable to point me to any prejudice that they would have suffered as a result of the lack of sufficient notice.

#### Whether Motions 3, 4 and 5 should be nullified as advance notice of the motions was not given

76     Paragraph 1(2)(b) of the First Schedule to BMSMA requires a notice of a meeting to “include each proposed resolution to be considered at the meeting”. Paragraph 1(4) of the First Schedule to BMSMA also provides for the following:

> (4)    No motion shall be submitted at a general meeting unless —

>> (a)    notice of the motion has been given in accordance with this paragraph; or

>> (b)    the motion is a motion to amend a motion of which notice has been so given, provided the amendment does not change the subject matter of the motion.

77     It is clear to me that no advance notice was given for Motions 3, 4 and 5, though I note that one of the matters to be considered in the 2019 AGM, as set out in paragraph 7.4 of the 2019 Notice, is “\[t\]o decide what matters, if any, shall be determined only by the \[MCST\] at a General Meeting.” Indeed, at the 2019 AGM itself, Motions 4 and 5 were discussed in the context of paragraph 7.4 of the 2019 Notice. However, I do not think paragraph 7.4 of the 2019 Notice is sufficient to give advance notice of Motions 4 and 5, given the content of Motions 4 and 5.

78     Given the lack of notice, and unless otherwise shown, the natural conclusion is that there would be prejudice to one or more subsidiary proprietors who did not attend the 2019 AGM. I note that of the 8 units in the Development, only 5 subsidiary proprietors or their proxies attended. Another 3 subsidiary proprietors did not attend. It seems to me possible that if given notice of Motions 3, 4 and 5, these subsidiary proprietors might have attended the 2019 AGM. Given how Section 103(2) of BMSMA is phrased, I consider that the burden of proof is on the Respondents to establish that there was no prejudice to anyone. However, the Respondents did not produce any evidence to show that these 3 subsidiary proprietors would not have attended the 2019 AGM even if they were given advance notice of Motions 3, 4 and 5, or would otherwise have voted for those motions if they had attended. Consequently, I find that prejudice has been established.

79     I therefore nullified Motions 3, 4 and 5

#### Whether Motions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 should be nullified because Mr Simon Bay was prevented from voting

80     As I have found above that the Applicants are entitled to attend, vote and appoint a proxy for all of the MCST’s general meetings, which includes the 2019 AGM, it was wrong for the Respondents to have excluded Mr Simon Bay’s votes.

81     Furthermore, given that all 5 motions were passed with 2 votes for and 1 vote against, allowing Mr Simon Bay to vote would have altered the result of all the motions since Mr Simon Bay would have opposed all 5 motions. That meant that the votes for all 5 motions would be 2 votes for and 2 against, and pursuant to Section 2(2) of BMSMA, none of the motions would have passed.

82     Consequently, I nullified all 5 motions on this ground.

## Whether the Applicants had standing to request inspection of documents in the MCST’s custody or control pursuant to Section 47(1) of BMSMA

83     Section 47(1) of BMSMA provides as follows:

> **Supply of information, etc., by management corporations**

> 47.—(1)    A management corporation shall, upon application made to it in writing in respect of a lot which is the subject of the subdivided building concerned by a subsidiary management corporation, or by a subsidiary proprietor or mortgagee or prospective purchaser or mortgagee of that lot or by a person authorised in writing by such a subsidiary proprietor or mortgagee and on payment of the prescribed fee, do any one or more of the following things as are required of it in the application:

>> (a)    inform the applicant of the name and address of the chairperson, secretary and treasurer of the management corporation and of any person who has been appointed under section 66 as managing agent;

>> (b)    make available for inspection by the applicant or his agent —

>>> (i)    the strata roll;

>>> (ii)   the notices and orders referred to in section 29(1)(g);

>>> (iii)   the plans, specifications, certificates, drawings and other documents delivered under section 26(4);

>>> (iv)   the minutes of general meetings of the management corporation and of the council;

>>> (v)    the books of account of the management corporation;

>>> (vi)   a copy of the statement of accounts of the management corporation last prepared by the management corporation in accordance with section 38(10);

>>> (vii)  any notice under section 3, 8 or 16 of the Land Acquisition Act, or any copy of an award under section 10 of that Act, received by the management corporation for any non-lot acquisition relating to the strata title plan for which the management corporation is constituted; and

>>> (viii)  any other record or document in the custody or under the control of the management corporation,

>> at such time and place as may be agreed upon by the applicant or his agent and the management corporation and, failing agreement, at the subdivided building at a time and on a date fixed by the management corporation under subsection (2)…

84     The scope of Section 47(1) of BMSMA is wide. Unlike a discovery request, the subsidiary proprietor does not require reasons for requesting the documents. Nor does he have to establish relevancy.

85     In the OS, the Applicants had sought for “all records and/or documents” under the MCST’s control, without any apparent limitation. In their written submissions, the Applicants restricted its request to the following categories of documents:

> (a)     All minutes of meetings of the MCST and/or the management council (“MC”) pursuant to Section 47(1)(b)(iv) of BMSMA;

> (b)     All accounts of the MCST pursuant to Section 47(1)(b)(v) of BMSMA;

> (c)     All invoices for third party services hired by the MCST, and which the MCST had claimed from the Applicants in its invoices dated 1 January 2019, 1 April 2019, 1 July 2019 and 1 October 2019 or any other invoice issued by the MCST pursuant to Section 47(1)(b)(viii) of BMSMA.

86     At the hearing before me, the Respondents reiterated their position that the Applicants did not have standing to make the request under Section 47(1) of BMSMA. In the alternative, the Respondents argued that the width of the Applicants’ request was unreasonable. The dispute between parties only spanned several years, but the records potentially spanned a period of 30 years since the MCST was constituted in 1980. At the hearing the Applicants’ counsel agreed that he would restrict the temporal scope of the request for documents.

87     The Applicants’ counsel thereafter wrote to the Registry on 27 October 2020. In that letter, the Applicants appeared to restrict its request for accounts and minutes of meeting to a certain time period. However, the Applicants also appeared to _enlarge_ the scope of their request for documents beyond the three categories set out in the written submissions (as set out at \[85\] above). The categories of documents requested were as follows:

> (a)     Book-keeping records, account records and bank statements for the years from 2018, 2019 and 2020;

> (b)     Accounts Payable and Expenses, if different from Item 1 above, for the years from 2018, 2019 and 2020;

> (c)     All third-party invoices which the MCST had effectively claimed 100% reimbursement (and had imposed late payment interest) from the Applicants;

> (d)     All communication/purchase order/contract between the MCST and 98 Construction Pte Ltd relating to the MCST’s instructions and engagement of 98 Construction Pte Ltd to remove various fixtures and installations at the development (including the exhaust);

> (e)     All communication and/or contract between the MCST and Singapore Accounting and Business Services Pte Ltd;

> (f)     All council meeting minutes and/or discussion notes from 1999 to 2020 (including any email and/or messages exchanged over WhatsApp or any other messaging service exchanged between council members showing the matters discussed between them);

> (g)     Insurance policies from 1999 to 2020;

> (h)     Strata Roll;

> (i)     All communications and documents exchanged between the MCST and the SCDF relating to the alleged unauthorised fixtures and installations for all the commercial units.

88     I should point out that when the Applicants’ counsel listed out the categories of documents in their letter, they had not distinguished between the MCST and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. This is not correct, as the obligation in Section 47(1) of BMSMA is imposed on the MCST only, and no one else. The documents must be in the custody or control of the MCST. Therefore, in so far as the request extends to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, that would be wrong.

89     Given the enlarged scope of the document request, I gave the Respondents an opportunity to respond to the Applicants’ counsel letter of 27 October 2020. The Respondents did not argue that this enlarged scope of the document request was in anyway unfair or unreasonable. Instead, the Respondents restricted their objections to the following:

> Having reviewed the schedule as provided by the Applicants, the Respondents are of the view that the scope and nature of the documents sought would give rise to, amongst others, personal data protection and confidentiality concerns. If the Court is minded to grant prayer 5 (or any part thereof) \[of the OS\] upon determination of the Applicants’ locus, the Respondents request an opportunity to address the Court on the same. This is given that the Court will have to give further directions bearing in mind the issues involving personal data protection, privacy, confidentiality and such other collateral purposes arising from the disclosure.

90     Given my findings above on the Applicants’ standing, and in particular that they are entitled to exercise all rights in relation to the Property and they should be considered the “subsidiary proprietors”, they have the standing to seek the documents pursuant to Section 47(1) of BMSMA.

91     As for the scope of the request, as I indicated earlier, there is no need for a subsidiary proprietor to justify their request, although the Applicants have done so in the letter of 27 October 2020. So long as the documents are within the custody or control of the MCST, the Applicants are entitled to inspect them. I note also that the Respondents did not object to the scope of the request, save to raise issues of personal data protection and confidentiality.

92     On the issue of the need to protect personal data, I would gratefully adopt the decision of the Deputy Commissioner of the Personal Data Protection Commission Mr Yeong Zee Kin in _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 4436_ \[2018\] SGPDPC 18. In that decision, a complaint had been made against the management corporation of a development for allowing a subsidiary proprietor to view CCTV footage kept by the management corporation. The subsidiary proprietor wanted to view the footage to locate a missing cat. The complainant asserted that the footage could disclose the identity of other individuals. The management corporation argued that it had an obligation to allow the subsidiary proprietor to inspect the footage, pursuant to Section 47 of BMSMA. The Deputy Commissioner held that Section 47 of BMSMA prevailed over Section 21 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No 26 of 2012) (“PDPA”) and the management corporation’s actions were therefore justified. His reasoning, which I adopt, is as follows (at \[10\] to \[14\]):

> 10    Section 47 of the BMSMA states that the Organisation shall make available for inspection any document or record in the custody or under the control of the Organisation... As such, the Organisation has a legal obligation to provide inspection and copies of documents or records to any subsidiary proprietor under section 47 of the BMSMA.

> 11    Section 21 of the PDPA gives a data subject the right to access personal data about him that the Organisation has in its possession or under its control. The data subject’s right of access is curtailed by subsection (2) and (3). Subsection (2) absolves the Organisation from providing — “is not required to provide” (but presumably has a discretion to provide if it is reasonable to do so) — access in any of the situations enumerated in the Fifth Schedule. In contrast, subsection (3) is a mandatory injunction that prohibits the Organisation from providing access — “shall not provide” — in any of the situations enumerated therein. In the present case, the pertinent provision is subsection (3)(c). The Organisation cannot provide (and has no discretion in the matter) access to personal data that can reasonably be expected to reveal personal data about another individual. The PDPC has issued advisory guidelines on the operation of section 21 of the PDPA which requires organisations to redact personal data about other individuals from documents that are provided to a data subject pursuant to a data subject access request, unless consent for disclosure have been obtained from these other individuals.

> 12    The subordination provision in section 4(6)(c) of the PDPA becomes operative when there are inconsistencies between the provisions of any other written law and the provisions in Parts III to VI of the PDPA. It operates by placing the PDPA provisions in subordination to other written law, such that the provisions of such other written laws shall prevail in the event of any inconsistencies. In the present case, the two potentially inconsistent provisions are section 47 of the BMSMA and section 21 of the PDPA.

> 13    The subsidiary proprietor’s right to inspect and take copies of any document or record under section 47 of the BMSMA is not subject to any restrictions. Whereas the data subject’s access right under section 21 of the PDPA to access personal data about him is subject to restrictions. A subsidiary proprietor has the right to inspect and take copies of CCTV footages under section 47 of the BMSMA without any requirement for the redaction of personal data about other individuals that happen to be captured as part of the video record. If the same request is made by the subsidiary proprietor under section 21 of the PDPA in exercise of his data subject access rights, personal data of other individuals have to be redacted unless their consent have been obtained.

> 14    In the face of this inconsistency, I am obliged by section 4(6) of the PDPA to decide that section 47 of the BMSMA shall prevail over section 21 of the PDPA in the present case, to the extent that the Organisation can provide inspection of CCTV footages to the _subsidiary proprietor _without the need to redact personal data of other individuals or to seek their consent for such disclosure. However, it should be borne in mind that section 47 of the BMSMA only applies when it is a person entitled under that provision, eg a _subsidiary proprietor_, is making the application for inspection of the CCTV record. It has no application when the request for inspection is made by any other resident or visitor to the property, in which case the request should be handled as a data subject access request under section 21 of the PDPA.

93     Consequently, where a request for inspection has been made under Section 47 of BMSMA, the MCST does not have to be concerned with data protection issues and should allow inspection without redacting personal data.

94     The issue of whether the protection of confidential information is a basis for refusing a request to inspect documents made under Section 47 of BMSMA is slightly different. In the recent case of _Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 0827 v Aikyu Trading Co (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 217</span> at \[43\] to \[47\], Andre Maniam JC left open the resolution of this very issue. On my part, there is no evidence before me of any of the requested documents raising any confidentiality issues. In fact, it is entirely possible that, after a review of its records, the MCST will conclude that no confidentiality issue arises. It is therefore not necessary for me to decide whether the protection of confidential information is a basis for refusing a request to inspect documents made under Section 47 of BMSMA. Nevertheless, I will grant parties liberty to apply to deal with any possible confidentiality issues that may arise.

95     Consequently, I ordered the MCST to allow the Applicants to inspect the documents listed out at \[87\] above, such inspection to take place no later than 21 days hereafter. I also granted parties liberty to apply, should there be any confidentiality issues arising from any documents to be inspected. In that respect, if the MCST is not prepared to allow inspection because of confidentiality issues, it must first establish that the protection of confidential information is a basis for refusing a request to inspect documents made under Section 47 of BMSMA.

## The issues in relation to the Fixtures and the 2019 Fixtures Removal

### Material background facts

96     Before the Deceased had passed away, he had installed various fixtures and undertaken works in and around the Property, including to the Development’s common property. The fixtures were installed in 2004, 2013 and 2015. Although there was originally a much longer list of fixtures that the MCST objected to, by the time the OS was filed, the fixtures at issue were the following: air-conditioning compressor, liquified petroleum gas (“LPG”) system and exhaust system. A restaurant / eating house was being operated from the Property which explains why the LPG system and exhaust system was installed. Both the LPG system and the exhaust system had a number of different parts or components. For convenience I will refer to the disputed fixtures as the “Fixtures”.

97     Parties disputed whether consent was properly obtained for the Fixtures but what is undisputed is that the MCST took no action against the Deceased to remove the Fixtures until September 2018, save for one occasion.

98     That occasion was in 2007, when the then Chairman of the MCST council Mr Devinder Singh wrote to the Deceased asking him to provide information and documents about the Fixtures (amongst other things), including evidence of the MCST’s approval of the Fixtures. This led to the Deceased filing a magistrate’s complaint against Mr Singh. This then led to a settlement agreement between the Deceased and Mr Singh made on 15 November 2007 before the Community Mediation Centre (“Settlement Agreement”). Under the Settlement Agreement, the Deceased agreed to undertake certain actions and provide documents to the MCST. Amongst other things, the Deceased agreed to provide to Mr Singh “documentary evidence…on the fixtures, LPG and exhaust ducts”. The MCST says the documents were never provided, but the Applicants say it must have been provided as otherwise the MCST would have taken further action against the Deceased.

99     The MCST wanted to take action against the Applicants for the Fixtures and called for an EOGM on 23 December 2018 to pass the following resolution:

> (a)     That the Council of the MCST be authorised to commence legal proceedings on behalf of the MCST against the Subsidiary Proprietor and the occupiers of Unit 53 and any other relevant party, in order to compel the removal of any or all fixtures and installations that Unit 53 had done on the MCST’s common property without the MCST’s written permission, and to pay the legal fees, disbursements and incidental costs of the proceedings out of the MCST’s funds;

> (b)     Unless otherwise ordered by the Court or Strata Titles Board, all costs including legal fees on an indemnity basis, disbursements and incidental costs incurred by the Management Corporation in the proceedings be recovered from and levied on Unit 53, in accordance with Resolution 5.1 passed at the AGM of the MCST on 24 September 2018

> (the “2018 Resolution”).

100    The resolution did not pass as the votes were 2 for and 2 against.

101    Motion 3 passed at the 2019 AGM (see \[68\] above) attempted to negate the decision made at the 2018 EOGM. As I have held that Motion 3 must be nullified, the decision not to pass the 2018 Resolution stands.

102    Sometime in January and February 2019, the MCST nevertheless proceeded to take matters upon itself and removed some but not all of the Fixtures (i.e., the 2019 Fixture Removal). The MCST charged the Applicants for the costs of the 2019 Fixture Removal, costs of letters of demand and interest charges. The Applicants paid a sum of $6,276 to the MCST under protest.

### Parties’ arguments

103    The Applicants have raised the following arguments in support of their assertion that the 2019 Fixture Removal was wrong, that they are entitled to be repaid the sum of $6,276 which they paid to the MCST under protest, and that they are entitled to damages:

> (a)     The Fixtures had been in place for a long time, some since 2004, but the MCST had never before taken action;

> (b)     The MCST’s council had approved the LPG system and exhaust system in 2004 through the 2004 Minutes;

> (c)     Under the Settlement Agreement, the Deceased was to provide to Mr Singh (the then chairman of the MCST council) documents evidencing MCST’s approval of the Fixtures, and the Deceased must have done so because no further action was taken by the MCST against the Deceased;

> (d)     The LPG system and exhaust system were necessary as the Property was being used as a restaurant / eating house;

> (e)     The LPG system and exhaust system had been certified as safe by various authorities such as SCDF, NEA and URA;

> (f)     The MCST could not take action in relation to the Fixtures as it was not able to pass the 2018 Resolution at the 2018 EOGM; and

> (g)     No supporting documents have been provided to support the sum of $6,276 claimed by the MCST, especially the costs the MCST paid to third parties.

104    The MCST disagreed that the 2019 Fixture Removal was unlawful, for the following reasons:

> (a)     The 2004 Minutes were forged;

> (b)     Even if the 2004 Minutes were not forged, the approval granted was improper because the Deceased was in a conflict of interest when he approved the Fixtures in his capacity as the MCST’s council chairman and member;

> (c)     No documents were provided by the Deceased pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Deceased and Mr Singh;

> (d)     The Fixtures encroached on the Development’s common property and amounted to exclusive use of the common property, and the necessary resolution pursuant to Section 33 of BMSMA had not been obtained;

> (e)     The Fixtures also affected the external appearance of the buildings comprised in the Development, in breach of Section 37(4) of BMSMA;

> (f)     There has not been proper authorisation and/or licensing obtained in respect of the Fixtures, in particular the LPG system.

105    In addition, as part of the Respondents’ counterclaim, they want the Applicants to completely remove the rest of the Fixtures (i.e., those not already removed by the MCST), effect certain rectification works resulting from the 2019 Fixtures Removal, as well as to reinstate certain windows on the Property which have apparently been altered.

### OS action is not appropriate for the resolution of the claims and counterclaims

106    It can be seen that whilst the broad issue is whether the Fixtures can remain or would need to be removed, because of the arguments raised by parties, a number of very factually intensive sub-issues arise. I consider the resolution of these factual sub-issues to be critical to the issue of whether the Fixtures should be removed. Although the MCST has exercised self-help remedies by proceeding to remove some of the Fixtures without first obtaining a court order to do so, I do not think that they should be in a better position than a management corporation who does not take matters into its own hands and instead seeks a court order to remove offending works and fixtures.

107    That would mean that whether or not a court allows the Fixtures to remain would depend on the principles set out in _Choo Kok Lin and anor v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2405_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 4 SLR(R) 175</span> at \[55\] to \[61\] (“_Choo Kok Lin_”). In _Choo Kok Lin_, the court held that where there is an encroachment by one land owner on the property of another or a subsidiary proprietor has erected structures without the permission of the management corporation, a mandatory injunction will not necessarily be issued to force the removal of the structures or end the encroachment. In deciding whether to grant the mandatory injunction, the court would balance all the circumstances and consider all factors to achieve a fair result. Amongst other things, the court must take into consideration the benefit which the order will confer on the applicant and the detriment which it will cause the respondent. The conduct of parties would also be scrutinised.

108    Whilst the MCST is not seeking a mandatory injunction in respect of those Fixtures which they have removed, I do not think that the MCST should be excused from the requirements in _Choo Kok Lin_, when considering whether the removal of the Fixtures was proper. To put it another way, the MCST should not be in a better position than a management corporation who comes to court to seek an order for the removal of offending fixtures, just because the MCST had taken it upon itself to remove the fixtures without any court order first. I consider it to be somewhat perverse if it were otherwise as it would encourage management corporations to take matters into their own hands and remove offending fixtures, rather than come to court to adjudicate the matter.

109    The issue of whether the Fixtures should be removed or can remain would therefore require a consideration of all the circumstances and factors in order to achieve a fair result. Unfortunately, I do not think it would be possible to resolve the various relevant factual disputes on affidavit evidence alone. I also consider that there is a fair amount of evidence which is highly relevant, and which neither party has dealt with.

#### Whether the 2004 Minutes were a forgery

110    I start with the issue of the 2004 Minutes which the Respondent says are forgeries. They rely on a report by a forensics expert which essentially states that the font used in the 2004 Minutes did not exist in 2004, and that the 2004 Minutes could not have been printed in 2004. Consequently, the Respondents have repeatedly argued that the 2004 Minutes “have been conclusively proven to be forged”. I respectfully disagree. The Applicants’ evidence is that the 2004 Minutes was printed off a soft copy on or around 2018, and then passed to their solicitors. The soft copy is now gone because it was in a hard disk which became damaged and could not be recovered. Therefore, it is not the case that the 2004 Minutes were printed in 2004, which is the fundamental assumption made by the Respondents’ forensics expert. If what the Applicants had was a soft copy, then the fact that it was printed in one font or another does not really tell us whether the 2004 Minutes were a forgery.

111    I would have thought that the more critical issue is whether the council meetings actually took place on 23 April 2004 and 24 May 2004. According to the 2004 Minutes, apart from the Deceased, three other subsidiary proprietors were also present at both meetings. But the Respondents have not said whether they have approached these subsidiary proprietors or obtained evidence from them to confirm whether the meetings actually happened, or to confirm the contents of the 2004 Minutes. It is possible that some of these subsidiary proprietors may have passed away or are now uncontactable. However, without first investigating this, it seems to me unsafe to ignore their evidence.

#### Whether the Deceased provided documents pursuant to the Settlement Agreement

112    Next I turn to the Settlement Agreement between the Deceased and Mr Singh. On the one hand, no further action was taken by Mr Singh or the MCST against the Deceased after the Settlement Agreement, suggesting that the matter was resolved satisfactorily. This means the “documentary evidence…on the fixtures, LPG and exhaust ducts” must have been provided by the Deceased to Mr Singh. On the other hand, the MCST says it has no such documents. I would have thought the best person to shed light on this is Mr Singh himself. However, neither party appeared to have approached him or explained what has happened to him. His evidence, if available, would be important.

#### The past conduct of the MCST and subsidiary proprietors

113    The next important factual issue is generally how the MCST and the subsidiary proprietors had acted in the past in relation to not only the Fixtures but other fixtures which may have encroached on the common property. This is relevant to the issue of acquiescence or consent. Based on the evidence before me, it appeared that the MCST in the past was not particularly strict about ensuring that any fixtures strictly complied with BMSMA. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, especially if all the other subsidiary proprietors did not object. It has to be remembered that the Development is a small one, with only 8 units. It is not impossible or far-fetched in those circumstances for subsidiary proprietors to take a cooperative approach to the issue of fixtures which encroach on common property. Perhaps there was a mutual understanding amongst the subsidiary proprietors that such fixtures would generally be acceptable and would not be objected to, so long as every subsidiary proprietor is allowed to build the fixtures. That may provide some explanation as to why the Fixtures, which are fairly large (especially the exhaust system) was not objected to from 2004 to 2018. I am of course speculating here, but the point is, this is an intensely factual matter to which no evidence at all has been adduced by parties. It is a matter which a court will necessarily take into account when it considers whether the Fixtures should be allowed to remain.

#### The MCST’s record keeping

114    I think it is also important to investigate the MCST’s record keeping. This may become critical if there are no witnesses available who can give relevant evidence. For example, if Mr Singh is not available to give evidence, how would a court determine whether the Deceased had provided documents to Mr Singh pursuant to the Settlement Agreement? Whilst the MCST has said that they do not have any such documents, the assumption is that if the documents had been provided, it would be in the MCST’s possession. That also assumes that the MCST’s record keeping is good. I am not sure if these assumptions can necessarily be made without further investigation. Indeed, at the hearing I asked Respondents’ counsel whether they had undertaken the task of reviewing the MCST’s records to determine how good their record keeping is – for example, does the MCST have in their possession all documents which they should have, or are there gaps in the documentation? Respondents’ counsel acknowledged that they had not gone through that exercise. The exercise is important because some of the relevant matters transpired 16 years ago, and the present members of the MCST’s council were not members at that time. If after conducting such an exercise, the MCST finds that the record keeping is good, that is a fair foundation on which the MCST can then argue that if the Deceased had provided documents to Mr Singh pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, it would be in the MCST’s possession, and that the fact that it is not suggests they were never provided.

#### Whether the 2018 Resolution prevents the MCST from commencing proceedings against the Applicants for the Fixtures

115    It should become clear, from my discussion above, that I am inclined to the view that some of the claims and counterclaims in the OS should proceed by writ action, rather than an OS action. However, the Applicants have argued that the MCST cannot commence proceedings against them for the Fixtures, because of the failure to pass the 2018 Resolution in the 2018 EOGM. I set out once again the 2018 Resolution that was not passed:

> (a)     That the Council of the MCST be authorised to commence legal proceedings on behalf of the MCST against the Subsidiary Proprietor and the occupiers of Unit 53 and any other relevant party, in order to compel the removal of any or all fixtures and installations that Unit 53 had done on the MCST’s common property without the MCST’s written permission, and to pay the legal fees, disbursements and incidental costs of the proceedings out of the MCST’s funds;

> (b)     Unless other ordered by the Court or Strata Titles Board, all costs including legal fees on an indemnity basis, disbursements and incidental costs incurred by the Management Corporation in the proceedings be recovered from and levied on Unit 53, in accordance with Resolution 5.1 passed at the AGM of the MCST on 24 September 2018.

116    The Applicants argued that because the 2018 Resolution was not passed, that decision bound the MCST and the MCST could not therefore commence proceedings against the Applicants in relation to the Fixtures without first revoking the 2018 Resolution. The Applicants rely on Sections 58 and 59 of the BMSMA and paragraph 13 of the First Schedule of BMSMA. The relevant parts of Sections 58 and Section 59 are as follows:

> **Council’s decisions to be decisions of management corporation**

> **58.**—(1)    Subject to the provisions of this Act, the decision of a council on any matter, other than a restricted matter, shall be the decision of the management corporation.

> **…**

> (4) In subsection (1), “restricted matter”, in relation to a council of a management corporation, means —

>> (a)    any matter a decision on which may, in accordance with any provision of this Act or the by-laws, only be made by the management corporation pursuant to a unanimous resolution, special resolution, 90% resolution, comprehensive resolution, resolution by consensus or in a general meeting of the management corporation, or only by the council at a meeting; and

>> (b)    any matter referred to in section 59 and specified in a resolution of that management corporation passed for the purposes of that section.

> **Restrictions imposed on council by management corporation**

> **59**.    A management corporation may in a general meeting decide, by ordinary resolution, what matters or class of matters, if any, shall be determined only by the management corporation in a general meeting.

117    Paragraph 13 of the First Schedule of BMSMA is as follows:

> **Amendment or revocation of unanimous or special resolutions**

> 3.    A unanimous resolution, resolution by consensus, comprehensive resolution, 90% resolution or special resolution of a management corporation shall not be amended or revoked except by a subsequent unanimous resolution, resolution by consensus, comprehensive resolution, 90% resolution or special resolution, as the case may be.

118    I am unable to agree with the Applicants’ argument. I find that the failure to pass the 2018 Resolution did not mean that the MCST could not commence proceedings against the Applicants for the Fixtures.

119    As a starting point, the MCST’s right to commence proceedings against the Applicants or any subsidiary proprietors is not a “restricted matter” under Section 58(4)(a) of BMSMA. There is nothing in the BMSMA which states that before any litigation is commenced against a subsidiary proprietor, the matter has to be put to a vote at a general meeting. This is to be compared to, say, Section 33 of BMSMA which expressly provides that any decision allowing a subsidiary proprietor exclusive use and enjoyment of or special privileges in respect of common property must be put to a vote at a general meeting and the necessary approval obtained.

120    The issue then becomes whether the _failure_ to pass the 2018 Resolution thereby renders the issue of whether proceedings can be commenced against the Applicants a “restricted matter” under Section 58(4)(b) of BMSMA. The wording of Section 59 of BMSMA is specific – the MCST may in a general meeting _decide_, by ordinary resolution what matters or class of matters are to be determined only in a general meeting. In this case, the 2018 Resolution was not passed and so no decision was made. I am unable to agree with the Applicants that the failure to pass the 2018 Resolution meant that there was a decision not to commence proceedings against the Applicants. I am also unable to agree that the failure to pass the 2018 Resolution meant that the subsidiary proprietors in the general meeting accepted that the Fixtures can remain. One simply does not follow the other. The failure to pass the 2018 Resolution was simply not a decision under Section 59 of BMSMA.

121    It may help to look at the matter in another way. Imagine that the Applicants sought to pass a resolution that the MCST cannot commence proceedings against the Applicants for the Fixtures. Assuming the votes were 2 for and 2 against (similar to the votes for the 2018 Resolution), such a resolution would fail. Does it follow then that a _decision_ has been made to commence proceedings against the Applicants? It does not.

122    Another reason why the failure to pass the 2018 Resolution is not a decision under Section 59 of BMSMA is because the 2018 Resolution was not a resolution to decide what matters or class of matters must be determined in a a general meeting. A resolution which sought to put certain matters out of the reach of the MCST council and in the hands of the subsidiary proprietors in a general meeting would need to be explicit about its purpose. For example, the resolution could say that the decision on certain matters cannot be decided by the council and will have to be decided in a general meeting. In fact, the Respondents sought to achieve this through Motion 4 (see \[68\] above). The 2018 Resolution, however, does not say that the decision on a matter or a certain class of matters can only be determined in a general meeting.

#### Conclusion

123    Because of these intensely factual matters which I am unable to resolve on affidavit evidence or to which no evidence at all has been adduced, I am unable to decide the following reliefs being claimed by parties:

> (a)     The Applicants’ claim for the recovery of $6,276 paid to the MCST under protest;

> (b)     The Applicants’ claim for damages for the 2019 Fixtures Removal;

> (c)     The Respondents’ counterclaim for a declaration that the 2004 Minutes are a forgery;

> (d)     The Respondents’ counterclaim for a mandatory injunction to remove the rest of the Fixtures and effect other rectification and reinstatement works.

124    These claims and counterclaims would have to proceed by writ action. After I issued my oral grounds on 24 November 2020, I requested parties to submit on the orders I should make. I considered that there were several options open to parties – the present OS could be converted into a writ action, or parties could file a fresh writ action to deal with the claims and counterclaims. Parties were broadly of the view that no specific orders were required, though the Applicants informed me that it would bring its claims into DC 2809, which was a suit brought by Ms Aroul against the Applicants, in relation to some of the same Fixtures that are the subject of the OS.

125    I therefore did not grant any specific orders, save for ordering that the claims and counterclaims are to be resolved via writ action otherwise than the through the OS.

## Whether the late payment interest of 30% levied by the MCST is unenforceable

126    At the MCST’s AGM held on 24 September 2018, the following resolution was passed (the “Interest Resolution”):

> **Interest**

> To consider and if approved, resolve that interest at the rate of 30% per annum or at any rate as determined by the subsidiary proprietors, calculated on a daily basis, be levied if payment for all contributions, interest and other charges due to the management corporation are received after 30 days from the due date.

127    The Applicants argued that the 30% interest rate was unconscionable and extravagant, relying on the principles in _Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, Limited v New Garage and Motor Company, Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1915\] AC 79</span>, which were adopted by the Court of Appeal in _CLASS Medical Centre Pte Ltd v Ng Boon Ching_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 386</span> (“_CLASS_”). The Applicants also referred me to _Hong Leong Finance v Tan Gin Huay and anor_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 755</span> where the Court of Appeal found that on the facts an interest rate of 18% was extravagant.

128    The Respondents pointed to the fact that the 1st Applicant, who attended the AGM held on 24 September 2018, had voted for the Interest Resolution (at that time, the MCST did not object to the 1st Applicant attending and voting on behalf of the Estate). I should say that, if the penalty argument was well-founded, the fact that the 1st Applicant had agreed to the provision is irrelevant. Whether or not a provision is a penalty does not turn on whether any party had agreed to that provision as that would mean that no provision in a contract can ever be found to be a penalty. Instead, as the Court of Appeal in _CLASS_ explained at \[64\], the court looks at the following guidelines to determine if the provision was a penalty:

> (a)     It will be held to be a penalty if the sum stipulated for is extravagant and unconscionable in amount in comparison with the greatest loss that could conceivably be proved to have followed from the breach.

> (b)     It will be held to be a penalty if the breach consists only in not paying a sum of money, and the sum stipulated is a sum greater than the sum which ought to have been paid.

> (c)     There is a presumption (but no more) that it is penalty when a single lump sum is made payable by way of compensation, on the occurrence of one or more or all of several events, some of which may occasion serious and others but trifling damage.

129    Ultimately however I found that the penalty argument was _not_ well-founded. This was because the Interest Resolution did not function as a contract and the rule on penalties applies only to breaches of contracts.

130    In _Tunas Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 562_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 756</span>, the court explained that a resolution passed at an AGM is generally not a contract between the MCST and the subsidiary proprietors (at \[46\] to \[51\]):

> _Legal character of the AGM resolution on costs_

> 46    The defendant relied on the AGM resolution to recover S&C costs from the plaintiff. For convenience, I set out the AGM resolution on costs passed in the year 2007:

>> 7.3    \[The\] Meeting resolved that _all_ costs (e.g. legal costs on a solicitor and client basis, disbursements and incidental costs, which include but not limited to postage, transport, etc, incurred in the recovery of any outstanding payment, interests or such other amounts owing to the Management Corporation in any actions taken against any subsidiary proprietors, occupiers or lessee for any breach, contravention or non-compliance with any duty, by-law, resolution and regulation relating to the subdivided building), _shall be recovered_ from the subsidiary proprietors, occupiers or lessees concerned … \[emphasis added\]

> 47    Resolutions of similar effect were passed at the defendant’s 2008 and 2009 annual general meetings. As for the defendant’s 2010 to 2013 annual general meetings, the minutes were not produced, but Mr Lim’s position was that the 2010 to 2013 resolutions were of similar effect.

> 48     **In my view, the defendant’s submission on the binding nature of the AGM resolution on costs was misconceived. This is because a resolution is a decision of a meeting of a corporate body** (see N E Renton, _Guide for meetings and organisations_ vol 2: _Guide for Meetings_ (LBC Information Services, 7th Ed, 2000) at para 4.1 and A D Lang, _Horsley’s Meetings: procedure, law and practice_ (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2010 at para 11.1)). _Black’s Law Dictionary_ (Bryan A Garner chief ed) (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed, 2014) defines “resolution” as “\[f\]ormal action by a corporate body of directors or other corporate body authorising a particular act, transaction or appointment” \[emphasis added\]. This decision is one that may be varied or rescinded by a later resolution.

> 49     **The general rule is that a resolution is not a contract between the entity and the members or between the entity and third parties, but is instead a decision of the entity, made by the members of that entity. It may however be binding on members of the entity if this is provided for statutorily or in the constitutional documents of the entity** (eg, the strata title plan’s by-laws) (_Koh Sin Chong Freddie v Singapore Swimming Club_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 1240</span> at \[74\]; see also Tan Cheng Han SC gen ed, _Walter Woon on Company Law_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2009) at para 6.69).

> 50    As stated, the defendant did not produce its by-laws. In any event, standard by-laws would ordinarily deal with the use and enjoyment of the parcel comprised in the strata title plan (see ss 32(2) and 32(3) of the BMSMA and the Second Schedule of the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations 2005 (S 192/2005)).

> 51    Turning to the AGM resolution itself (at \[46\] above), the language used there did not go far enough to categorically state that the defendant could _ipso facto_ bill to the subsidiary proprietor the defendant’s S&C costs. The AGM resolution did not record or allude to an agreement by subsidiary proprietors to pay the defendant’s S&C costs. Rather, as a matter of construction, the AGM resolution was a mandate or authority given by the subsidiary proprietors in the annual general meeting for the management corporation to pursue claims for S&C costs against defaulters who were subsidiary proprietors, occupiers or lessees. Mr Lim’s bare assertion that the plaintiff was contractually bound by the AGM resolution was misconceived and unhelpful. \[emphasis in bold added\]

131    The Court of Appeal recently held in _Denka Advantech Pte Ltd and anor v Seraya Energy Pte Ltd and anor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 119</span> at \[185\] that the penalty rule only applied to breaches of contract.

132    Therefore, I find that the Interest Resolution was no more than a decision made at a general meeting giving the MCST a mandate or authority to claim against subsidiary proprietors interest at 30% for unpaid “contributions, interest and other charges”. Since it was not a contract, the rule on penalties does not apply. As the Applicants did not raise any other argument apart from the rule on penalties to attack the Interest Resolution, I therefore declined to grant a declaration that the 30% interest rate was exorbitant and unconscionable.

## Post-hearing matters

### Applicants’ requests

133    At the end of the hearing on 16 October 2020, the Applicants’ counsel raised a concern regarding the impending AGM of the MCST that had to be held by the end of the year (which I will refer to as the “2020 AGM”). They were concerned that if no decision is made before then, they would not have an opportunity to participate in the 2020 AGM, given the Respondents’ position. They requested that I grant interim relief to protect the Applicants’ position in the event that the 2020 AGM is held before I made my decision.

134    I declined to grant any interim relief at the time, as I thought it was premature to do so given that there was no indication of when the 2020 AGM was to be held, save that it needed to be held by the end of the year. I also assured parties that I would issue my decision as soon as possible. However, I informed Applicants’ counsel that if they received notice that the 2020 AGM was going to be held before I issued my decision, they could write to me seeking interim relief and I will consider the request.

135    On 29 October 2020, the Applicants’ counsel wrote to me and informed me that the Applicants had in a letter sent on 23 October 2020 to the MCST requested that the MCST include certain motions to be considered at the 2020 AGM. However, in a notice and agenda of the 2020 AGM sent on 27 October 2020 (“2020 AGM Notice”) from the MCST, these motions were not included. The Applicants asserted that the MCST was aware of its letter of 23 October 2020 when it issued the 2020 AGM Notice, and wrongfully excluded the motions that the Applicants wanted to include. The Applicants pointed to Paragraphs 12(1), (2) and (3) of the First Schedule of BMSMA, which is as follows:

> **Requisition for motions to be included on agenda for general meeting**

> 12.—(1)    Any subsidiary proprietor may, by notice in writing, served on the secretary of the council of the management corporation or (as the case may be) subsidiary management corporation, require inclusion in the agenda of the next general meeting of the management corporation or (as the case may be) subsidiary management corporation of a motion set out in the first-mentioned notice and the secretary shall comply with the notice.

> (2)    The secretary of the council shall give effect to every requirement in every notice under sub-paragraph (1).

> (3)    Sub-paragraph (1) shall not require the inclusion of a motion on the agenda of a general meeting for which notices have already been given in accordance with this Schedule, but in that case, the secretary of the council shall include the motion in the agenda of the next general meeting after that.

136    Quite apart from the wrongful exclusion of the Applicants’ motions, the Applicants say that 2020 AGM Notice also failed to include a number of mandatory motions stipulated in Paragraph 1(3) of the First Schedule of the BMSMA.

137    Consequently, the Applicants requested that I direct the MCST to issue a supplementary or amended notice and agenda to include the Applicants’ motions as well as the mandatory motions.

138    The MCST’s position was that it did not receive the Applicants’ letter of 23 October 2020 until after it had issued the 2020 AGM Notice. Furthermore, the Respondents maintained its position that the Applicants had no standing to deal with the Property, and that included requesting that motions be included in the 2020 AGM. Finally, the MCST pointed out that the relief being sought by the Applicants was not a relief sought in the OS.

139    I decline to grant the relief sought by the Applicants. It was not relief sought in the OS and it would not be appropriate for me to grant the relief. Even though I have held that the Applicants had the requisite standing, the reliefs being sought by the Applicants were not ancillary to my holding, nor did it flow naturally from my holding. Additionally, there was a factual issue that had to be determined, i.e., whether the MCST received the Applicants’ letter before the 2020 AGM Notice was sent out, and evidence would be needed before any finding can be made. I do not think I can make any determination on the basis of the letters that the parties sent. In any event, there is nothing stopping the Applicants from requisitioning an EOGM so that their motions can be considered.

### Respondents’ requests

140    In a letter dated 29 October 2020, the Respondents’ counsel requested for leave to address the court on further directions should I determine that the Applicants had standing to participate in the MCST’s general meetings. The Respondents request was as follows:

> The Respondents also humbly request that they be given the opportunity to address the Court and seek the appropriate directions, should the Court determine that the process of transmission is not necessitated and/or that personal representatives are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings of the management corporation (and exercise such other rights accorded to subsidiary proprietors) without complying with the requirements of transmission. This is given that such a determination would have an impact on the MCST’s rights and obligations. In particular:

>> (i)    How an MCST is to (a) verify the validity and authenticity of a Will, (b) verify whether a redacted Will does in fact give someone the right to attend or vote at the MCST's meetings or whether there were in fact restrictions in the Will that had been redacted, (c) whether the MCST is to obtain legal advice to interpret the Will;

>> (ii)   Whether a Grant of Probate is necessary before personal representatives may exercise such powers and how an MCST is to verify the authenticity and validity of such Grant, in the absence of transmission, especially in the light of Section 132 of the LTA;

>> (iii)   Whether, pending verification of the Will and Grant of Probate, an MCST is to proceed with the convening of their general meetings or acceptance of votes, proxies and nominations from such purported personal representatives at the meetings;

>> (iv)   Whether the personal representatives should bear the legal costs of verification and advice on interpretation of the Will and Grant;

>> (v)    Whether the aforesaid principles would apply in circumstances where a third party produces to the MCST other unregistered instruments, such as an unregistered sale and purchase agreement, an unregistered first mortgage or an unregistered deed of trust;

>> (vi)   In the event that there is more than one personal representative, whether such rights may be exercised singularly or must they be exercised by all the personal representatives;

>> (vii)  What should the MCST do in the event that a Grant is subsequently revoked or if it turns out that there was double probate. How should the MCST treat the status of resolutions passed or not passed in such circumstances, both prospectively and retrospectively;

>> (viii)  Whether the MCST is required to verify that there is no double probate and if so, how;

>> (ix)   Whether the MCST is obliged to have regard to or affected by notice of matters that it would not otherwise be affected by under the LTA had the title been transmitted;

>> (x)    If a Grant of Probate is not necessary (since it is the Applicants’ submission that title derives from the Will), is it necessary for the MCST to confirm death, and how the MCST is to verify whether a subsidiary proprietor is in fact deceased; and

>> (xi)   Whether the MCST can be liable if any verification of the death, Will or Grant, or interpretation of the Will turns out to be wrong.

141    Some of these questions are answered by my decision. However, in so far as they are not, I do not think it is appropriate for me to assist the MCST by trying to answer these questions when they do not need to be answered to determine the claims and counterclaims made in this OS. The MCST will have to seek legal advice if these issues do arise. It is also apparent to me that some of these questions are clearly hypothetical – for example questions (v), (vi), (vii), (viii) and (ix). Courts decide real controversies and do not entertain theoretical or hypothetical issues. As VK Rajah J (as he then was) explained in _Chee Siok Chin and ors v Minister for Home Affairs and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 582</span> at \[109\]:

> It is trite law that a court will not grant a declaration on abstract issues or hypothetical questions. Nor will a court generally state the position on a particular area of the law unless it is dealing with the facts of a case. Furthermore, a court will not normally make a pure declaration on a motion without ascertaining the complete facts and contentions…

142    Consequently, I refuse the Respondents’ request for further directions on the issues set out in the Respondents’ counsel’s letter dated 29 October 2020.

## Conclusion and orders

143    I summarise my conclusions as follows:

> (a)     I possessed the jurisdiction to hear the OS;

> (b)     The court’s positive finding on the Applicants’ standing in OS 682 was not necessarily binding on me;

> (c)     After the Deceased’s death, the Property vested in the Applicants and they stepped into the shoes of the Deceased and could exercise all rights in relation to the Property. They should be considered the “subsidiary proprietors” of the Property. They had the right to deal with the Property, and specifically, they are entitled to participate in any of the MCST’s general meetings. Their right to do so is not conditional on them making a transmission application under Section 107 of LTA;

> (d)     The Applicants had standing to request from the MCST inspection of documents pursuant to Section 47(1) of BMSMA;

> (e)     As the adjudication of the following claims and counterclaims requires the resolution of intensely factual matters that are not suited for adjudication via an originating summons, they are to proceed via writ action:

>> (i)       The Applicants’ claim for the recovery of $6,276 paid to the MCST under protest;

>> (ii)       The Applicants’ claim for damages for the 2019 Fixtures Removal;

>> (iii)       The Respondents’ counterclaim for a declaration that the 2004 Minutes are a forgery;

>> (iv)       The Respondents’ counterclaim for a mandatory injunction to remove the rest of the Fixtures and effect other rectification and reinstatement works;

> (f)     The failure to pass the 2018 Resolution was not a decision under Section 59 of BMSMA and did not restrict the MCST pursuant to Section 58(4)(b) of BMSMA and consequently there was no bar to the MCST commencing proceedings against the Applicants in relation to the Fixtures; and

> (g)     As the late penalty interest of 30% was not imposed pursuant to any contract, the rule against penalties did not apply.

144    I therefore allowed the OS in part and made the following orders:

> (a)     The Applicants, as executors and trustees of the Estate, are entitled to act for and represent the Estate on the following matters in relation to the Property:

>> (i)       Commencing this OS in relation to the Property;

>> (ii)       Participating in any of the MCST’s general meetings, including attending, voting or appointing a proxy in the general meetings; and

>> (iii)       Communicating with the MCST on all matters in relation to the Property.

> (b)     The following motions passed at the 2019 AGM are nullified:

>> (i)       That all costs including legal fees on an indemnity basis, disbursements and incidental costs incurred by the MCST in the recovery of arrears of management fund, sinking fund and special levy contributions and in compelling the subsidiary proprietor(s) to comply with the requirements of the BMSMA, By-Laws and House Rules shall be recoverable from the subsidiary proprietor(s) concerned (i.e., Motion 1);

>> (ii)       That interest at the rate of 30% per annum or any rate as determined by the subsidiary proprietors, calculated on a daily basis, be levied if payment for all contributions, interest and other charges due to the MCST are received after 30 days from the due date (i.e., Motion 2);

>> (iii)       That the minutes of the 2018 EOGM be amended so as to retrospectively invalidate the attendance and vote of the 1st Applicant at the 2018 EOGM (i.e., Motion 3);

>> (iv)       That the MCST’s written consent is required for installation / fixing of pipes, exhaust ducts or any fixtures other than air-con compressors at the ground floor back wall of shop units. Above the shop windows, and the recess areas of the side walls under each respective unit’s windows and the front and back of the building under the windows of the respective residential units and at the walls of the roof terraces of the respective units are common property and permission shall only be given by the council in general meeting (i.e., Motion 4); and

>> (v)       That the MCST shall not issue any letter of no objection to any of the matters that are not within the purview of the council without a resolution by the council in general meeting (i.e., Motion 5).

> (c)     The MCST is to allow the Applicants to inspect the following documents:

>> (i)       Book-keeping records, account records and bank statements for the years from 2018, 2019 and 2020;

>> (ii)       Accounts Payable and Expenses, if different from Item 1 above, for the years from 2018, 2019 and 2020;

>> (iii)       All third-party invoices which the MCST had effectively claimed 100% reimbursement (and had imposed late payment interest) from the Applicants;

>> (iv)       All communication/purchase order/contract between the MCST and 98 Construction Pte Ltd relating to the MCST’s instructions and engagement of 98 Construction Pte Ltd to remove various fixtures and installations at the development (including the exhaust);

>> (v)       All communication and/or contract between the MCST and Singapore Accounting and Business Services Pte Ltd;

>> (vi)       All council meeting minutes and/or discussion notes from 1999 to 2020 (including any email and/or messages exchanged over WhatsApp or any other messaging service exchanged between council members showing the matters discussed between them);

>> (vii)       Insurance policies from 1999 to 2020;

>> (viii)       Strata Roll;

>> (ix)       All communications and documents exchanged between the MCST and the SCDF relating to the alleged unauthorised fixtures and installations for all the commercial units.

>> The inspection is to take place no later than 21 days hereafter. Parties have liberty to apply, should there be any confidentiality issues arising from any documents to be inspected. In that respect, if the MCST is not prepared to allow inspection because of confidentiality issues, it must first establish first that the protection of confidential information is a basis for refusing a request to inspect documents made under Section 47 of BMSMA;

> (d)     The following claims and counterclaims are to proceed via writ action otherwise than through the OS:

>> (i)       The Applicants’ claim for the recovery of $6,276 paid to the MCST under protest;

>> (ii)       The Applicants’ claim for damages for the 2019 Fixtures Removal;

>> (iii)       The Respondents’ counterclaim for a declaration that the 2004 Minutes are a forgery;

>> (iv)       The Respondents’ counterclaim for a mandatory injunction to remove the rest of the Fixtures and effect other rectification and reinstatement works.

> (e)     All other claims and counterclaims are dismissed;

> (f)     Costs fixed at $8,000 (all in) to be paid by the Respondents to the Applicants. The Respondents are liable jointly and severally for the costs. In respect of costs which the MCST will be paying, if the MCST is levying contributions on the subsidiary proprietors to pay those costs, the contributions are to be levied on all subsidiary proprietors save for the Applicants.

> (g)     Liberty to apply.

## DC/SUM 4264/2020

145    After I issued my oral grounds on 24 November 2020, the Respondents applied in DC/SUM 4264/2020 to stay my inspection orders as set out at \[144(c)\] above. I considered that a stay was warranted. This was because if the Respondents’ appeal was allowed on the inspection order, the appeal would be rendered nugatory if before then the Applicants were allowed to inspect and take copies of the documents. However, I did not think the stay should be granted until the Respondents’ appeal was disposed off. The Respondents’ only objection to the inspection was on the basis that the transmission under Section 107 of the LTA had not been done, and therefore the objection would fall away once the transmission process was completed. The Applicants informed me that they had already started the transmission process and expected to complete it soon. Consequently, any stay should only last until the resolution of the appeal, or until the transmission process was completed, whichever was earlier.

146    As such, I ordered that, pending the full and final determination of HC/RAS 32/2020 (including any appeals arising therefrom) or the completion of the transmission of the Property pursuant to Section 107 of the LTA (whichever is earlier), there be a stay of execution of my order at \[144(c)\] above.
