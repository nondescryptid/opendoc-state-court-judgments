\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9151/2022/01.\]

27 September 2022

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       The accused pleaded guilty to one charge for driving a minibus without reasonable consideration (usually referred to as “inconsiderate driving”), which resulted in a collision that caused the death of a motorcyclist, an offence under s 65(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”). As the accused had a previous conviction of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA, he is considered a repeat offender and liable therefore to be punished under (“p/u”) s 65(2)(b) read with (“r/w”) s 65(6)(a) of the RTA.

2       I sentenced the accused to eight months’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for the mandatory period of eight years with effect from his release.

## Statement of Facts (“SOF”)

3       The accused admitted to the SOF without qualification.

4       On 22 February 2020, at about 2000 hours, the accused and his wife were at Clarke Quay. The accused drank some beer while he was there.

5       On 23 February 2020, at about 0000 hours, they left Clarke Quay. The accused drove Minibus PC4515A towards their rental unit located at Blk 335A Yishun Street 31, where his wife alighted at the carpark.

6       After dropping off his wife at about 0039 hours, the accused drove the Minibus out of the carpark. He intended to make a right turn onto Yishun Avenue 6 in the direction of Yishun Avenue 1. As he approached the exit of the carpark, the accused checked for oncoming traffic along Yishun Avenue 6. He spotted motorcycle FBE6346M that was ridden by one Muhammad Hafiz bin Abdul Razak (“the deceased”) to his right. The deceased was riding his motorcycle towards the accused, along Yishun Avenue 6 in the direction of Yishun Avenue 7. The deceased had the right of way.

7       The accused failed to stop at the stop line at the exit of the carpark even though there was a stop sign. He assessed that it was safe for him to make the right turn onto Yishun Avenue 6 and proceeded to do so. As he was executing the right turn, the accused checked for vehicles coming from his left. At this point, the motorcycle ridden by the deceased collided into the front right portion of the Minibus. The impact of the collision flung the deceased off the motorcycle, and he landed on the grass verge.

8       A nurse living nearby proceeded to the scene and attended to the deceased. She performed several rounds of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (“CPR”) on the deceased as he had no heartbeat. The deceased was conveyed by ambulance to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was later pronounced dead. A subsequent autopsy performed certified that his death was due to multiple injuries that were consistent with those being sustained from a road traffic accident.

9       Meanwhile, at the scene, the accused had called for police assistance, and they arrived shortly thereafter. One of the police officers noticed that the accused smelt of alcohol and had a flushed face with bloodshot eyes. Two breathalyser tests were administered on the accused at 0127 and 0236 hours. He passed both of them.

10     The Minibus and the motorcycle were subsequently sent for mechanical inspection. The inspections did not find any evidence to suspect that there was mechanical failure to the Minibus and motorcycle that may have caused / contributed to the accident.

11     Further, on 9 May 2018, the accused was convicted in State Court No 21 for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA and was fined $500. Accordingly, the accused is considered a repeat offender by virtue of s 65(8)(b) of the RTA and liable to be p/u s 65(2)(b) r/w s 65(6)(a) of the RTA.

## Antecedents

12     Other that the offence of speeding mentioned above that rendered the accused a repeat offender under s 65(8) of the RTA, the accused’s conviction history showed that he was also fined $500 in State Court No 21 on 2 May 2022 for a similar offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA. Although there were two separate convictions, both speeding offences were committed on the same day, namely, 8 February 2018.

## Sentencing submissions and plea in mitigation

### Prosecution’s sentencing submission

13     The Prosecution sought a sentence of between 10 to 14 months’ imprisonment and eight years DQAC with effect from release.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) It was submitted that the sentencing approach adopted in _PP v Selvakumar Rajan_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 252</span> (“_Selvakumar_”), where the offender was convicted of an offence of inconsiderate driving causing _simpliciter_ would be applicable to the present case.

14     The first step would be to identify the accused’s level of culpability. In _Selvakumar_, the district court at \[120\] adopted the working definition in relation to an offender’s level of culpability as set out in _PP v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen_”). The Prosecution submitted that these definitions should be accepted for the present case. The working definitions in _Cullen_ are set out below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="28.28%"><col width="71.72%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Definition</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Generally, no dangerous driving behaviour exhibited.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Typically careless or inconsiderate manner of driving like failing to give way when other road users have the right of way or exhibiting poor control of the vehicle.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Some manner of dangerous driving behaviour exhibited.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This may include swerving across lanes suddenly and without warning, driving against the flow of traffic, weaving in and out of traffic, speeding, beating red light, handphone driving, sleepy driving or failing to use visual aids while driving etc.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious manner of dangerous driving exhibited.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This may include several forms of dangerous driving exhibited, dangerous driving behaviour exhibited over an extended distance or deliberate bad driving behaviour</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

15     The court in _Selvakumar_ also set out the sentencing ranges based on the offender’s level of culpability for the offence of inconsiderate driving causing death _simpliciter_, ie. s 65(1)(b) p/u s 65(2)(a) r/w s 65(6)(a) of the RTA. As the accused is considered a repeat offender under the RTA, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing ranges in _Selvakumar_ should be adjusted to reflect the higher prescribed punishment. Both frameworks are set below for comparison:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="21.34%"><col width="39.26%"><col width="39.4%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Selvakumar </em></b><b>Sentencing Framework under s 65(2)(a), RTA</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Proposed Adjusted Sentencing Framework under s 65(2)(b), RTA</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 12 months’ imprisonment</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(A fine of up to $10,000 or a lower sentence may be imposed in exceptional circumstances)</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months to 2 years’ imprisonment</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(A fine of up to $20,000 or a lower sentence may be imposed in exceptional circumstances)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 to 4 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24 to 36 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">4 to 6 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

16     Based on the above, the accused’s culpability was assessed by the Prosecution to be “_around the middle range of low_”. Therefore, the applicable sentencing range was a term of imprisonment of between eight months to two years. The Prosecution had reached this assessment based on the following factors, namely that the accused:

> (a)     had flouted the traffic rules by failing to stop at the stop line before making a right turn even though there was a stop sign at the exit of the carpark;

> (b)     was looking to his left while executing a right turn even though the deceased was approaching on his right;

> (c)     was driving that night even though he had consumed alcohol earlier that evening. Although he had passed the breathalyser test at the scene, police officers noticed that he had blood shot eyes and a flushed face.

17     As such, it was submitted that the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range was between 12 to 16 months’ imprisonment.

18     Next, the Prosecution submitted that the following offender specific factors were present in the case. These were that:

> (a)     He had pleaded guilty early, and the Prosecution submitted that a discount of two months’ imprisonment should be accorded to the accused;

> (b)     That the accused was considered a repeat offender under the RTA. He has two speeding antecedents.

19     The Prosecution therefore submitted that the appropriate sentence was one between 10 to 14 months’ imprisonment and the mandatory disqualification term of eight years DQAC.

### Defence’s sentencing submission / plea in mitigation

#### Sentencing submission

20     The Defence submitted for a sentence of “_around 5 months’ imprisonment and an 8-year DQAC_”.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) The approach taken by the Defence to reach this sentence is similar to that of the Prosecution. The Defence agreed that the sentencing framework set out in _Selvakumar_ would be applicable in the present case.

21     Like the Prosecution, the Defence accepted the functional definitions of culpability set out in _Cullen_ and adopted in _Selvakumar_.

22     As the accused is a repeat offender, the Defence also proposed that the sentencing ranges set out in _Selvakumar_ be adjusted to reflect the higher prescribed punishment for repeat offenders. The adjusted sentencing ranges proposed by the Defence is the same as that that was proposed by the Prosecution.

23     The Defence had assessed the accused’s culpability as low and submitted that it fell the lowest end of the spectrum. Given that the indicative sentencing range for an offender of low culpability is between eight months’ and two years’ imprisonment, it was submitted that the presumptive starting point should be eight month’s imprisonment.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

24     Next, it was submitted that the following offender-specific factors should be taken into consideration, namely that the accused:

> (a)     has had a safe driving history, apart from the speeding convictions in 2018. The present incident resulted from a momentary misjudgement on his part;

> (b)     was genuinely remorseful. Significant weight should therefore be placed on his plea of guilty;

> (c)     had assisted fully with investigations. He had taken proactive steps to help the insurers contact the family of the deceased as the insurers had some difficulty initially;

> (d)     was the sole breadwinner of the family. His incarceration would affect his business, and the livelihoods of the ten people that were employed by the company.

25     Accordingly, it was submitted that a downward adjustment of three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate, giving a sentence of five months’ imprisonment and the mandatory disqualification of eight years DQAC.

#### Precedents

26     To support the submission of five months’ imprisonment, the Defence cited two cases for the court’s consideration. These were _PP v Ter Chee Kwang_ (DAC-903704-2021) (“_Ter_”) and _PP v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 681</span> (“_Ganesan_”).

27     In _Ter_, the offender pleaded guilty to a charge of driving without due care and attention (also known as “careless driving”) causing death _simpliciter_ ie. s 65(1)(a) p/u s 65(2)(a) r/w s 65(6)(a) of the RTA. The collision occurred at an uncontrolled cross junction between a major road and a minor. As the deceased was riding across the cross-junction along the major road, the offender collided him when he entered the junction from the minor road. The offender had failed to stop at the stop line. Further, as the offender’s view of oncoming traffic along the major road was obstructed by certain structures, he should have taken extra care before proceeding across the junction, but he did not. The offender also failed a breathalyser test at the scene, however, when he was subsequently tested by a Breath Analysing Device (“BAD”), it showed that his breath specimen contained 6 ug of alcohol per 100 ml of breath (the legal limit being 35 ug per 100 ml of breath). The offender was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment and eight years DQAC.

28     The Defence submitted that, although the offender in _Ter_ was not a repeat offender like the accused, the court should not place undue weight on the accused’s prior speeding conviction. The prior speeding conviction was committed in 2018, prior to the RTA amendments in 2019 and there is no evidence that there was any such speeding behaviour exhibited in the present case which would increase the accused’s culpability significantly. It was therefore submitted that this, together with the fact that the offender in _Ter_ had failed a breathalyser test (and the accused in the present case did not) would suggest that a five-month imprisonment term would be appropriate.

29     In _Ganesan_, the offender was convicted after trial for an offence of causing death by a rash act under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). The offender executed a U-turn with his lorry. He then quickly cut across two lanes thereafter. The lorry collided with a motorcycle that was travelling down the opposite side of the road. The motor cyclist was injured whilst the pillion rider (and her unborn child) passed away. On appeal, the High Court enhanced the offender’s sentence from 12 weeks’ to five months’ imprisonment but upheld the disqualification term of eight years DQAC[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4).

30     The Defence submitted that _Ganesan_ involved a more aggravated form of driving offence when compared to the negligence in the present case. Taking into account that maximum prescribed punish under s 304A(a) of the PC is five years’ imprisonment compared to six years’ imprisonment for the present case, a sentence of five months’ imprisonment for the present case was reasonable.

31     It was acknowledged that _Ganesan_ was decided prior to the amendments to the RTA in 2019 and similar cases are no longer prosecuted under s 304A of the PC, however, it was submitted that _Ganesan_ remains useful and relevant.

## Decision on sentence

### The punishment prescribed by law

32     As earlier mentioned, the accused pleaded guilty to an offence of inconsiderate driving causing the death of a motorcyclist under s 65(1)(b) RTA. However, as he has a previous conviction of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA, he is considered a _repeat_ offender and therefore liable for enhanced punishment under s 65(2)(b) r/w s 65(6)(a) of the RTA. The punishment prescribed by law for these two offences are set out below to highlight the differences.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.48%"><col width="50.52%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Inconsiderate driving causing death under s 65(2), RTA</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Causing death simpliciter, p/u s 65(2)(a) &amp; s 65(6)(a)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Repeat offender, p/u s65(2)(b) &amp; s 65(6)(a)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both and DQAC of not less than 8 years.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 years or to both and DQAC of not less than 8 years.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

### The sentencing framework

33     Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the five-step approach set out by the district court in _Selvakumar_ at \[136\] would be applicable in the instant case. I did not disagree. The steps applicable in the present case are as follows:

> (a)     Identify the level of the offender’s culpability;

> (b)     Identify the indicative sentencing range;

> (c)     Identify the starting point within the indicative sentencing range;

> (d)     Adjusting the starting point, taking into account offender-specific factors.

#### Identifying the offender’s culpability

34     In traffic accidents where death is caused, there is no distinction in the level of harm, only in an offender’s culpability. Therefore, the first step would be to determine an offender’s culpability.

35     Both the Prosecution and the Defence both relied on the functional definitions in relation to the levels of culpability set out in _Cullen_ at \[109\] which was itself adopted in _Selvakumar_ at \[120\] – \[127\]. I note that these sentencing submissions were tendered in June 2022.

36     On 26 July 2022, the High Court determined the case of in _Sue Chang (Xu Zheng) v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 176</span> (“_Sue Chang_”). In _Sue Chang_, the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of driving without due care and attention causing grievous hurt, an offence under s 65(1)(_a_) p/u s 65(3)(_a_) r/w s 65(6)(_d_) of the RTA. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and the mandatory five years DQAC. This sentence was upheld on appeal.

37     On appeal, the Prosecution had urged the court to adopt the three levels of culpability and the corresponding functional definitions for each level as set out in _Cullen._ At \[92\] of _Sue Chang_, the High Court expressed its concern that the descriptions for each level of culpability significantly conflate the offences of careless or inconsiderate driving (under s 65 of the RTA) with that of reckless or dangerous driving (under s 64 of the RTA) and declined at this stage to provide a working definition for the different levels of culpability to avoid being overly prescriptive. Instead, the High Court left the proper categorisation of an offender’s level of culpability in each case to be determined by the sentencing court after an assessment and weighing of the following factors:

> (a)     The circumstances which may have required the offender to take extra care and consideration. For example, whether the offender was driving a heavy vehicle, or whether the offender was driving in a school zone, or the conditions present at that time;[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> (b)     The offender’s manner of driving. This would include, for example, driving against the flow of traffic, sleepy driving, drink driving, driving under the influence of drugs, driving whilst using a mobile phone, flouting traffic rules, or “hell riding”. Other considerations would pertain to the duration of the offender’s inattention, whether the distraction could be avoided, or the reasonableness of his misjudgement;[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> (c)     The offender’s conduct following the commission of the offence. For example, if the offender’s conduct is “belligerent or violent” upon arrest or where the offender fails to stop in an attempt to evade arrest or to avoid apprehension by the authorities, these would weigh against the offender.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

38     Hence, I did not adopt the working definitions for the various levels of an offender’s culpability as set out in _Cullen._ However, these definitions, and the factors listed by the High Court in _Sue Chang_ assisted me in the assessment of the accused’s culpability, namely whether it was Low, Medium or High.

#### Identify the indicative sentencing ranges

39     The next step is to determine the indicative sentencing ranges for each level of culpability.

40     In _Selvakumar_, at \[136,\] the court set out the indicative sentencing ranges based on an offender’s culpability. However, as the offender in _Selvakumar_ was convicted for the offence of inconsiderate driving causing death _simpliciter_, and the accused in the present case is a repeat offender and is therefore liabile for enhanced punishment, both the Prosecution and the Defence had suggested adjustments to the indicative sentencing ranges in _Selvakumar_. Both their proposed table of adjusted sentencing ranges were similar.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) I was of the view that this adjusted table appropriately reflected the enhanced sentences that is prescribed for repeat offenders, and it took into account the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament. I therefore proceeded to adopt the adjusted sentencing ranges proposed by both the Prosecution and the Defence for the purposes of the present case. The sentencing ranges are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.26%"><col width="73.74%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range under s 65(2)(b), RTA</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months to 2 years’ imprisonment</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(A fine of up to $30,000 or a lower sentence may be imposed <em>in exceptional circumstances</em>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 to 4 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">4 to 6 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

#### Identify the starting point within the indicative sentencing range

41     Having identified what the indicative sentencing range was, I next would have to identify the starting point within this range.

#### Adjusting the starting point, taking into account offender-specific factors

42     Having determined the indicative starting sentence, the next step would be to make further adjustments to account for offender aggravating and / or mitigating factors.

43     As the accused faced only a single charge, it was not necessary for the court to consider the totality principle

### Applying the sentencing framework

44     I proceeded to apply the sentencing framework to the present case. I note that the Prosecution and the Defence are in agreement with regard to the applicability of this framework.

#### The level of culpability

45     Of the three factors cited by the High Court in _Sue Chang_ at \[94\] -\[96\], that would affect the culpability of an offender, the most relevant in the present case is the manner of the accused’s driving. I agreed that the accused had flouted the following traffic rules. These are:

> (a)     Road Traffic (Traffic Sign) Rules. The accused had failed to stop at the stop line before executing a right turn. This was despite the fact that there was a stop sign at the exit of the carpark[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9); and

> (b)     The Highway Code. The accused did not conduct adequate checks when executing the right turn. According to the r 72 of the Highway Code, the accused should have looked right, then left, then right again. He did not do so. As he approached the exit to the carpark, the accused looked right and saw the deceased approaching, he then looked to the left as he proceeded to execute the right turn. He failed to look right again despite knowing that the deceased was approaching from that direction.

46     The culpability of the accused would be enhanced if the accused did drink and drive. In the SOF, the accused had admitted consuming some drinks earlier that evening. Although the accused had passed the breathalyser tests at the scene, the Prosecution nonetheless submitted this would enhance the accused’s culpability. In this respect, the Prosecution cited _PP v Wong Yew Foo_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 1198</span> (“_Wong Yew Foo_”) at \[32\], where the High Court had noted that if an offender decides to drink and drive, that itself was an aggravating factor.[^10]

47     In _Wong Yew Foo_ the offender accused pleaded guilty to one charge for causing the death of a cyclist by a negligent act under s 304A(b) of the PC and another charge for drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA. When exiting from a slip road onto a main road, the offender failed to keep a proper lookout and give way to a cyclist travelling on the main road. A collision occurred and the cyclist was run over and pinned under the motor car. He suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene. As the offender smelt of alcohol, a breath evidential analyser test was conducted. It revealed that the proportion of alcohol in the Respondent’s breath was 42μg of alcohol in every 100ml of breath, exceeding the prescribed limit by 7ug per 100 ml of breath.

48     In _Wong Yew Foo_ at \[32\], the High Court held that, apart from his failure to keep a proper look out, his conscious decision to drink and drive was an act of complete selfish disregard for the safety of other fellow road users. The offender could not have been ignorant of the risk that his judgment and driving skills were impaired as a result of his inebriation. I do not disagree with this observation.

49     However, this observation in _Wong Yew Foo_ should be seen in the proper context. The offender there was found to have alcohol in his breath that exceeded the prescribed limit and was accordingly also charged for drink driving. I am prepared to accept that, should an offender choose to drink and drive, and is thereafter involved in an accident, any amount of alcohol found in that offender would be a culpability enhancing factor irrespective of whether it is above or below the prescribed limit. However, in the present case, there was no evidence that there was any alcohol in the accused’s _breath_ at the time of the incident, if indeed there was any.

50     The accused did admit to having drinks at about drink at around 2000 hours or so as per the SOF and the police officer at the scene had noticed that the accused’s face was flushed and that he smelt of alcohol The first breathalyser test was taken at about 0127 hours, which was about slightly more than an hour after the accident. The accused passed the breathalyser test at the scene and he was therefore not taken to a police divisional headquarters for a BAD test to be administered. Although the accused did not deny that he drank earlier that evening, I accepted that by the time he drove home, sufficient time had passed such that there was either no or very little amount of alcohol remaining in him. Hence, there was no conclusive evidence that the accused was driving under the influence of drink. Accordingly, I did not consider this to be an aggravating factor.

51     The Defence had highlighted that “_it appeared_” that the helmet worn by the deceased was not of an approved type as it did not have a “TUV” label. Hence, it was submitted that it _may have contributed_ to the fractures to the deceased’s skull although it was conceded that it did not take away the accused’s negligence[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11).

52     This issue of contributory negligence was considered by the High Court in _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span> (“_Nickson Guay_”). The key point in _Nickson Guay_ is that the conduct of the victim or a third party must have a direct bearing on the culpability of the offender in order to affect the sentence to be imposed. In that event, the principle of proportionality should be taken into account when determining sentence to commensurate with the gravity of the offence.

53     At \[71\], Sundaresh Menon CJ explained as follows:

> “….. more fundamentally, a putative offender either is or is not legally responsible for the death of the victim; there are no degrees of legal responsibility. In convicting an offender, the court has determined as a matter of criminal law that the offender is _legally responsible for the death_…\[It\] would, therefore, be inconsistent to then punish him on the basis that he is somehow less responsible for the harm that was occasioned by his negligent conduct. The sentence meted out should in my judgment be proportionate to his moral culpability and all the resulting harm that he is _legally responsible for_. \[emphasis in original\]

54     In the present case, it could not be said definitively that the helmet worn by the deceased was not of an approved type, and even assuming that it could be shown that it was not of an approved type, whether this fact contributed to the deceased’s death. In any event, as recognised by the Defence, the wearing of a non-approved helmet had no direct bearing on the accused’s culpability. I therefore did not consider this to be a culpability reducing factor.

55     Therefore, the only culpability enhancing factors present here was that the accused had flouted traffic rules. Accordingly, I was of the view that his culpability should be assessed as being _Low_.

#### The indicative sentencing range

56     For the reasons mentioned above, I accepted the _table of adjusted sentencing ranges_ as proposed by the Prosecution and the Defence. For convenience, it is reproduced again and is as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.26%"><col width="73.74%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range under s 65(2)(b), RTA</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">8 months to 2 years’ imprisonment</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">(A fine of up to $30,000 or a lower sentence may be imposed <em>in exceptional circumstances</em>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 to 4 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">4 to 6 years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

57     Having assessed the culpability of the accused as _Low_, the indicative sentencing range based on this table would be a sentence of between eight months’ to two years’ imprisonment and the mandatory eight years DQAC.

#### The indicative starting sentence

58     I disagreed with the Defence’s submission that the indicative starting sentence should be at the lowest of this sentencing range ie eight months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that it should be slightly above this base sentence.

59     Upon reviewing the sketch plan and the vehicle damage report, the impact occurred when the victim’s motorcycle was already in the path of travel of the accused’s minibus. Therefore, the damage caused to the van was primarily to the front right side portion of his minibus. Further, there was no evidence that the deceased was travelling at a fast speed. Hence, the accused would have ample time to see the victim approaching him before he began executing the right turn _had he stopped at the stop line_. This was especially since Yishun Avenue 6 was a 2-lane road and the accident happened on the right lane. The minibus would have had to cross the first lane before colliding into the accused’s motorcycle travelling in the next lane. Thus, the accused’s culpability cannot be at the lowest end of low but should be minimally above that.

60     All considered, I adjudged the indicative starting sentence to be 10 months’ imprisonment.

#### Adjusting the starting point, taking into account offender-specific factors

61     I noted the following offender-specific factors in the present case that would warrant a downward adjustment of the indicative starting sentence:

> (a)     Pleading guilty. The main factor in the accused’s favour is that he pleaded guilty to the charge;

> (b)     Co-operation. I accepted the Defence’s submission that the accused had co-operated by assisting in police investigations.

62     In addition, the Prosecution had highlighted the accused’s previous speeding conviction on 9 May 2018[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). The Defence submitted that the two speeding convictions should not be overstated. Although there were two separate speeding convictions on two different days, both offences occurred on the same date, namely on 8 February 2018, within a short span of time.[^13]

63     I agreed with the Defence. The table of adjusted sentencing ranges had reflected a higher sentencing range for each level of culpability based the position of the accused as a repeat offender. Taken into account the nature of the accused’s antecedents, namely speeding, vis-à-vis the present offence, namely inconsiderate driving causing death, I found that the table of adjusted sentencing ranges had already adequately provided for such an uplift as a repeat offender. I found no need to further adjust the sentence upwards on account of this.

64     For the aforesaid reasons, I adjusted the indicative sentence downwards by two months, giving _a final sentence of eight month’s imprisonment_

#### The last look

65     Finally, I compared the final sentence that I have reached with the sentences that had been imposed by the courts in the precedent cases that have been cited, namely _Ter_, _Selvakumar_ and _Ganesan._

66     The Defence had cited _Ter_ to support their submission of five months’ imprisonment. I note that _Ter_ had some factual similarities to the present case (for example, the offender in _Ter_ was entering a major road from a minor road). However, I found _Ter_ to be of limited assistance as it was not accompanied by the sentencing judge’s reasons. In _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP and Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span>, the High Court at \[99\] was of the view that “_absent a reasoned judgment explaining a particular sentencing decision, bare reference to the outcomes in other cases will seldom be useful”_. More recently in _Abdul Aziz bin Mohamed Hanib v PP and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 101</span>, the same court at \[173\] noted that unreported decisions lack sufficient particulars to paint the entire factual landscape required to appreciate the precise sentences imposed. I therefore placed little weight on this.

67     Notwithstanding this, a review of _Ter_ would suggest that the final sentence of eight months’ imprisonment in the present case was appropriate in light of the fact that the punishment prescribed by law in the present case is double that in _Ter_.

68     In _Selvakumar_, the offender pleaded guilty to an offence of inconsiderate driving causing death _simpliciter._ The offender was driving his lorry (a heavy vehicle) out of a carpark. He did not stop at the stop line and proceeded to execute a right turn coming out of the carpark. While executing the right turn, he stopped in the middle of the 2-lane road just in time to avoid a collision with a motorcyclist who was travelling in the same direction as the deceased. The offender continued the executing the turn once the motorcyclist had passed even seeing the deceased, who was riding a bicycle, coming towards him quickly with his head down. The deceased collided directly onto the right side of the motor lorry together with his bicycle. The collision killed the deceased, who had the right of way.

69     The main factor that increased the offender’s culpability in _Selvakumar_ was the fact that he was driving a heavy vehicle, in addition to the fact that the offender failed to stop at the stop line. Therefore, the court assessed that the indicative starting sentence would be on the higher end of the range for low culpability ie. the six to 12-month imprisonment range.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) After considering the offender-specific factors, the court adjusted the sentence downwards by two months’ imprisonment to reach the final sentence of nine months’ imprisonment and the mandatory eight years DQAC.

70     I agreed with the assessment that the offender’s culpability in _Selvakumar_ was higher than that of the accused in the present case. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the indicative sentencing range was lower than that in the present case, the final sentence imposed on the offender was higher. Hence, I also concluded that the final sentence that I had reached in the present case was appropriate.

71     In _Ganesan_, on appeal, the offender was sentenced to five month’s imprisonment and eight years DQAC for the offence committing a rash act that caused death under s 304A(a) of the PC.

72     Although this was a case under the rash limb of s 304A of the PC, in _Ganesan_, at \[43\], the High Court held that it did not find that “_…. the Respondent’s rashness to be such a degree that, on top of giving rise to liability for the offence, it should separately be regarded as an aggravating factor._” At \[42\], the High Court found that “ ….. _no specific traffic regulations were violated (other than the obvious failure to keep a proper lookout and give way, which was what gave rise to the offence in the first place) …_” and further that, although the Respondent was driving a “lorry”, it was not a “heavy vehicle”, as it was under 1500 kg in weight and could be driven with a Class 3 driving licence.

73     Accordingly, the High Court assessed that this was a Low culpability case with a presumptive sentencing range of three to five months’ imprisonment (at \[55\]). As the deceased pillion rider’s unborn child was also killed, the High Court arrived at a sentence on the upper end of this range, namely five month’s imprisonment.

74      _Ganesan_, despite being a conviction under the rash limb of s 304A, does not appear as aggravated as the Defence has made it out to be.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) In fact, _Ganesan_ was considered by the court in _Selvakumar_ at \[131\] – \[135\] when determining the sentencing ranges for the offence of causing death _simpliciter_ under s 65(2)(a) of the RTA. Having reviewed _Ganesan_, I concluded that the final sentence I have determined in the present case was appropriate in the circumstances.

## Final sentence imposed

75     In summary, I had assessed the present case to be one of Low culpability, giving an indicative sentencing range of between eight months’ to two years imprisonment term based on an adjusted table of sentencing ranges for _repeat offenders_. This is a table that both the Prosecution and Defence had agreed that the court should adopt. This adjusted table of sentencing ranges is, in turn, based on the table of sentencing ranges derived from _Selvakumar_, a case of inconsiderate driving causing death _simpliciter._

76     From this, I adjudged that the indicative starting sentence within this range was ten months’ imprisonment. I then next proceeded to adjust this indicative starting sentence downwards by two months after considering the offender-specific factors that were present.

77     After taking a last look at the final sentence I had reached, I was of the view that the sentence that I had determined was appropriate in the circumstances and that it was not necessary to adjust the final sentence any further. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Eight month’s imprisonment and disqualified him from hold or obtaining all classes of driving licences for the mandatory minimum period of eight years with effect from his release</em>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

78     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against it.

79     It should be noted that upon his conviction on 4 August 2022, the accused sought to defer the commencement of the sentence of imprisonment until 12 September 2022. He did not thereafter seek a stay of his sentence of imprisonment pending the outcome of this appeal. He surrendered on 12 September 2022 and is presently serving sentence.
