## Undisputed Facts

3       The Accused was a foreign worker employed by Rai Builders Pte Ltd (“**Rai Builders**”) as a driver. Besides being a driver, he also helped Rai Builders to buy cheap second-hand scaffolding materials/construction materials.

4       The Accused knew one Ramasamy Ayyappan (“**Ayyappan**”) who worked for JA Scaffolding Engineering Pte Ltd ("**JASE**").

5       In exhibit P11, a police statement made by the Accused on 1 May 2018, the Accused stated that sometime in early March 2018, Rai Builders tasked the Accused to buy 150 pieces of 3-metre and 4-metre metal pipes, 100 pieces of 1-metre pipes, 100 metal decks, 2 bags of clamps and a number of 6-metre metal pipes. Hence, he went around to source for these construction materials and arranged to meet Ayyappan. At this meeting, it was agreed that Ayyappan would secretly sell the construction materials to the Accused at night when Ayyappan's boss was not around.

6       The Accused admitted that the construction materials bought from Ayyappan were stolen property. See exhibit P11, Q4A4. He bought these materials over 4 occasions during the night.

7       The materials amounted to about $10,510 but the Accused paid about $1,500 for it.

8       Ayyappan admitted that he shared the plan of stealing and selling JASE's goods with a co-worker, Rahman Md Maqsudur who acted as a look out at the material time. See exhibit P3, the police statement of Ayyappan dated 29 April 2018. Ayyappan also admitted that between 9 March 2018 and 28 March 2018, he had dishonestly misappropriated scaffolding materials from JASE, namely, 100 pieces of 6-metre metal pipes, 5 bundles of 2-metre and 3-metre metal decks, 120 pieces of 3-metre metal pipes and 3 bags of scaffolding clips, joint and base plates. These were sold to the Accused. This formed the basis of the charge against him.

9       Ayyappan pleaded guilty and was convicted on 14 June 2018. He was sentenced to 9 months' imprisonment. See exhibit P2.

10     After the second day of the trial on 24 July 2019, Rahman Md Maqsudur pleaded guilty to a similar charge and was sentenced to 8 months' imprisonment.

## Antecedents

11     The Accused was untraced

## Prosecution's address on sentence

12     The Prosecution submitted for a custodial sentence of at least 9 months' imprisonment. In support of the submission, the Prosecution highlighted that the scaffolding materials misappropriated were valued at $10,510. The Accused's fellow conspirators (Rahman Md Maqsudur and Ayyappan) were sentenced to 8 months' imprisonment and 9 months' imprisonment respectively.

13     The Prosecution conceded that the Accused was less culpable than Ayyappan but he had played an instrumental role as he was the one who purchased the scaffolding materials and had discussed the plan with Ayyappan.

14     It was also highlighted that the Accused had shown no remorse. This was demonstrated by his mitigation plea which continued to maintain his innocence despite his conviction.

15     The Prosecution had also tabulated a table showing a summary of the items returned to JASE by February 2021. It showed an outstanding loss of $5,920 to JASE after the return. The Prosecution submitted that little or no weight be attached to the late return of these materials. The bulk of it were returned in February 2021, about 3 years after the commission of the offences in March 2018. It was a partial restitution and were returned after the Accused's conviction but before sentence.

## Mitigation

16     Counsel for the Accused tendered 2 mitigation submissions dated 2 February 2021 and 3 March 2021 respectively. Both submissions were substantially the same.

17     It was submitted that the Accused's sentence should be between 3 to 6 months' imprisonment. In support of the submission counsel relied on the case of _Gopalakrishnan Vanita v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 310</span>.

18     In the latest written mitigation plea, counsel revised it to submit for a fine despite the fact that the penalty prescribed for the offence committed by the Accused was a mandatory imprisonment term up to 15 years and also liable to fine.

19     Counsel submitted that the Accused did not gain any pecuniary advantage and had a clean record. It was also claimed that the Accused had fully co-operated with the authorities.

20     It was also submitted that the value of the goods in question was not valued by an independent assessor. It was alleged that the Accused paid $1,700 for the used items stated in the mitigation plea dated 2 February 2021. It was also contended that value of these secondhand goods was about $1,200 - $1,300.

21     Counsel contended that the Accused's culpability was very low as he was just buying the stolen items. It was Ayyappan and Rahman Md Maqsudur who were the masterminds.

22     It was highlighted that the items had been returned to JASE.

23     Counsel devoted a major part of his written submissions on the circumstances why his client was not guilty despite the fact that the Accused had been found guilty.

24     In the mitigation plea counsel highlighted the personal background of the Accused. I was of the view that there was no mitigating value for such personal background as it was not exceptional.

25     Counsel also tendered a letter from the Accused's employer in support of the mitigation plea.

## Sentencing Considerations

26     The main sentencing considerations in this case were retribution and deterrence. See _PP v Mohammad Abdullah Ang Swee Kang_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] 2 MLJ 368</span>.

27     I also noted as highlighted above that the punishment prescribed for the offence was a mandatory imprisonment term up to 15 years and also liable to fine.

28     In terms of culpability, I agreed with the parties that the Accused was slightly less culpable than Ayyappan. But as pointed out by the Prosecution, the Accused played an important and instrumental role in the conspiracy and was the one who bought the stolen materials at a cheaper rate. I also found that he was the one who initiated the plan. See \[5\] and Q4A4 of exhibit P11. With respect, there was no basis for the allegation that Ayyappan and Rahman Md Maqsudur were the masterminds.

29     There was also evidence of premeditation in that the goods were bought and loaded onto the Accused's lorry under the cover of darkness and at a time when the boss of JASE was not around. Clearly this was planned to avoid detection.

30     Another factor considered was the value of the items. The charge for which the Accused was convicted stated the misappropriated items to be $10,510. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was reasonable to look at the cost of replacing the materials when assessing the harm caused to JASE. Moreover, most of the items were returned about 3 years later. JASE were deprived of the use of these materials during this period and would need to get the necessary replacement. Accordingly, I rejected the submission that the appropriate amount to look at was the sum of $1,700 which the Accused alleged was the amount he had paid for the stolen materials.

31     In considering the sentence, I gave little weight to the Accused for the partial restitution as it was done about 3 years after the offence was committed and after his conviction but before sentence. I agreed with the Prosecution that it was a case of returning it in the hope of a lesser sentence.

32     I rejected the submission that the Accused has shown remorse. As highlighted by the Prosecution, despite his conviction, the Accused continued to maintain his innocence. This demonstrated his lack of remorse.

33     In sentencing the Accused, I also considered the sentences meted out to the co-accused persons. With respect, I cannot see how there can be any consideration for a fine to be imposed as contended by counsel. It is very clear that the punishment prescribed by section 408 of the Penal Code is a mandatory imprisonment term up to 15 years. Fine may also be imposed in addition to the custodial term. There was no jurisdiction for the court to impose a sentence of fine only as urged by counsel.

## Sentencing Precedents

34     In _Soong Hee Yin v PP_ \[2001\] 2 SLR 253, the offender pleaded guilty to one charge of committing criminal breach of trust of a sum of $10,485.22 whilst employed as a servant under section 408 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to 9 months' imprisonment.

35     In _Gopalakrishnan Vanita v PP_, _supra_, the offender was convicted after trial of 3 charges under section 408 Penal Code for criminal breach of trust of sums amounting to $11,369.73, $12,440 and $30,113.29 respectively. The High Court held at \[35\] that for such amounts misappropriated, the sentence ranged from 9 to 15 months' imprisonment.

## Conclusion

36     Considering all the circumstances above, I sentenced the Accused to 9 months' imprisonment which was in line with the sentencing precedents and appropriately reflected his criminality. It was also in parity with the sentences meted out to the co-accused persons.

37     The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
