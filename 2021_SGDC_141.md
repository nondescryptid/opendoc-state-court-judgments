Damages – Assessment

Damages – Future medical expenses

Damages – Loss of earning capacity

27 July 2021

### Principal District Judge Toh Han Li:

## Introduction

1       This was an appeal by the plaintiff (“the appellant”) arising from an assessment of damages by the Deputy Registrar (“the DR”) in a motor accident case. The appeal touched specifically on the DR’s decision with regard to two heads of damages, namely future medical expenses and loss of earning capacity and the applicable principles for the award of these heads of damages.

## Background facts

2       The appellant was a 47-year old senior officer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (“RSAF”). He sustained personal injuries on 10 September 2015 when a taxi driven by the defendant (“the respondent”) collided into the rear of his car. Pursuant to a consent interlocutory judgment dated 7 June 2017, the respondent was to pay 100% of the damages assessed to be due to the appellant.

3       The accident caused the appellant to sustain (a) a Grade 1 whiplash injury to his neck, and (b) an injury to his lower back that aggravated a pre-existing L4-5 disc prolapse and this led to an annular tear at the same L4-5 disc.

4       Various heads of damages were agreed upon by the parties before the DR. For the present appeal, the appellant has appealed only against the DR’s award on the following heads of damages:

> a)     Future medical expenses comprising future cost of surgery, medication and acupuncture. The DR’s award and the appellant’s submission on what should be the amount awarded are as follows:

> b)     Loss of earning capacity. The appellant had sought $150,000 but the DR declined to make an award under this head of claim.

## Future medical expenses

### The Court of Appeal’s decision in Lua Bee Kiang

5       For future medical expenses, the key issue raised in this appeal was the import of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> _(“Lua”_) with regard to the principles in assessing and the quantification of future loss.

6       The DR held that the import of _Lua’s_ case was to lay down a principle that widely and generally governs all claims for future loss as stated at \[19\] of his GD:

> It seems to me evident that the Court of Appeal intended in that decision (at \[72\]) to lay down a principle that widely and generally governs all claims for future loss so that there is no possibility of distinguishing it or limiting its application. As the Court of Appeal explained (at \[65\]), proof on a balance of probabilities is appropriate for questions of historical fact but not so for enquiries as to what might happen in the future. Hence in considering the disputed items of future medical expense the starting question must be whether there is an “appreciable risk” that the plaintiff will incur the cost of medication, acupuncture and surgery in the future.

7       Appellant’s counsel took issue with the DR’s interpretation of _Lua’s_ case. She adopted a more limited reading of _Lua’s_ case and stated at \[2.6\] of her submissions:

> _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> (“_Lua Bee Kiang_”) does not propose that the principle of balance of probabilities should not be applied in determining future medical expenses. In fact, **it only states that the appreciable risk principle applies in cases where there is a future onset medical condition**.

> \[emphasis added\]

8       At the appeal hearing before me, appellant’s counsel was prepared to concede a slightly wider interpretation of _Lua’s_ case, namely that the appreciable risk principle applies not only to cases where there is a future onset medical condition, but where there is speculation as to whether the future event will happen.

9       That said, appellant’s counsel submitted that the issue of the appellant having to undergo surgery was _not_ speculation as to a future event, but something which the appellant would have to go through based on his _current medical condition_ caused by the respondent’s negligence. As such, given that the need for surgery had been demonstrated on a balance of probabilities, he should be awarded the full amount without any discount on the basis of appreciable risk.

10     Appellant’s counsel also submitted that the same principle should apply to the claims for medication and acupuncture, meaning to say that the appellant had demonstrated that these claims were required based on the appellant’s current medical condition and no discount on the basis of appreciable risk should have been applied by the DR.

11     Respondent’s counsel agreed with the DR’s interpretation of _Lua’s_ case and submitted that the appreciable risk test as set out in _Lua’s_ case was meant to apply to _all future losses_ which included the future cost of surgery, medication and acupuncture as in the present case and the DR was therefore correct in applying the relevant discount on the basis of appreciable risk. The respondent’s counsel also submitted that cases such as _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> which were relied on by the appellant’s counsel were _pre-Lua_ and therefore of no relevance.

12     In determining the import of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Lua_, it is worth examining the decision in _Lua_ in some detail. The relevant passages of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Lua’s_ case can be found at \[65\] to \[82\]. The header preceding \[65\] is titled “Assessing damages for future loss” and under “Applicable principles” the Court of Appeal states at \[65\]:

> **Proof on a balance of probabilities is a standard of proof that is applied in civil cases generally to discern whether a past event happened**. Such proof is necessary for the court to determine “whether \[the plaintiff’s\] case is more probably true than untrue” (see Jeffrey Pinsler, _Evidence and the Litigation Process_ (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) at para 12.092). In the absence of an exhaustive historical record, the notion that an event was more likely than not to have happened is an epistemic proxy for whether it did in fact happen. **By contrast, “there is no provable truth with regard to the future”**, as Vinodh Coomaraswamy J observed in the High Court decision of _Poh Fu Tek v Lee Shung Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 425</span> at \[42\] in the context of assessing the credibility of cash flow projections for the purpose of valuing a company. **It is not possible by human means to know what the future holds. Therefore, it would be unfair to fault a party for being unable to establish an assumption about a future event as true on the balance of probabilities. Instead, the question in that context is whether that assumption is reasonable, and if it is, an appropriate discount may be applied to take into account the risk that the event may not happen** (at \[42\]).

\[emphasis added\]

13     The Court of Appeal then examined the leading overseas authorities in this area, namely the United Kingdom House of Lords decisions of _Mallett v McMonagle, a minor by Hugh Joseph McMonagle, his father and guardian_ ad litem <span class="citation">\[1970\] AC 166</span>, _Davies (AP) (suing as widow and administratrix of the estate of Kenneth Stanley Davies, decd) v Taylor_ <span class="citation">\[1974\] AC 207</span> and the Australian High Court decision of _Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd_ (1990) ALR 545.

14     The Court of Appeal proceeds to state at \[72\] to \[73\]:

> **We are in general agreement with these authorities**. **In our judgment, in assessing damages for future loss –** such as cost of nursing care – arising from the possible future onset of a medical condition as a result of the defendant’s negligence**, the court must first determine whether there is an** **_appreciable risk_** **that the claimant will suffer that loss. If there is such a risk of future loss, then the claimant ought to be compensated for it.** The court’s task will be to evaluate that risk. **The court may take as its starting point an award corresponding to the full extent of that loss, and then adjust it to account for the remoteness of the possibility and the chance that factors unconnected with the defendant’s negligence might contribute to bringing about the loss.** In making this adjustment, however, the court should not be fixated on discerning a precise percentage by which the award should be discounted, because the exercise is inherently imprecise. To this extent, we agree with the minority’s view in _Malec_. Instead, the appropriate discount ought to be decided bearing in mind the principle stated by Lord Morris in _Mallett_, namely, that the opposing probabilities must be weighed with sympathy and with fairness for the interests of all concerned and at all times with a sense of proportion. Such an approach would be consonant with the central principle of fair compensation which underlies this area of the law.

> **This is representative of how future losses are assessed in personal injury cases generally. That assessment typically involves two sets of predictions to be made at the date of trial or settlement: (a) what would have happened in the future had the injury not been sustained and (b) what is likely to happen in the future now** (see _Cane and Goudkamp_ at p 118). The assessment of Mr Yeo’s need for future nursing care belongs to the latter category, while the assessment of his loss of future earnings, for example, belongs to the former. In both instances, the idea is not to establish historical truth, **but to determine the reasonable possibility of a future event**, which would then enable the court to grant a remedy that is proportionate to the degree of that possibility. This we have explained to be the approach to the claim for cost of future nursing care here. **Likewise, in relation to loss of future earnings, it has never been suggested that when determining the appropriate multiplier based on the claimant’s remaining working life expectancy, the court must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that but for the accident, the claimant would have worked for a certain number of years.** Instead, the reasoning is that it would be reasonable to think that a person like him would have worked X number of years, but that X should be reduced or increased on account of risks arising from the nature of his occupation or his personal characteristics (see the House of Lords decision of _Cookson (Widow and Administratrix of the Estate of Frank Cookson, decd) v Knowles_ <span class="citation">\[1979\] AC 556</span> at 568G–569A _per_ Lord Diplock). **These risks are conceived as being in the nature of “contingencies including mortality and the effect of other personal and structural considerations”**, in the words of this court in _Kenneth Quek_ (\[51\] _supra_) at \[57\]. Ultimately, as it is stated in _The Law of Damages_ (Andrew Tettenborn gen ed) (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2010) at para 29.50, “\[t\]he normal approach to cases where future events are in issue is to ask whether the probability of a given event is significant, and if it is to evaluate the chances of it occurring and adjust the award accordingly”.

\[emphasis added\]

15     In expressing its general agreement with the leading overseas authorities in this area, the Court of Appeal cited with approval at \[70\] the following passage from _Mallet’s_ case:

> The probability may be very high—99.9 per cent—or very low—0.1 per cent. But unless the chance is so low as to be regarded as speculative—say less than 1 per cent—or so high as to be practically certain—say over 99 per cent—the court will take that chance into account in assessing the damages. **Where proof is necessarily unattainable, it would be unfair to treat as certain a prediction which has a 51 per cent probability of occurring, but to ignore altogether a prediction which has a 49 per cent probability of occurring**. **_Thus, the court assesses the degree of probability that an event would have occurred, or might occur, and adjusts its award of damages to reflect the degree of probability. The adjustment may increase or decrease the amount of damages otherwise to be awarded_**_._

> \[emphasis added\]

16     If I paraphrased appellant’s counsel proposed approach, it would be that if something had not been shown on a balance of probabilities (less than 50%) than the appellant gets nothing but if the chance is more than 50% than the appellant gets the full sum. This appeared to be the approach that the High Court in _Mallet_ had characterised as “unfair”.

### Decision on future medical expenses

17     I first considered appellant’s counsel submission that the future surgery did not relate to a future event as the appellant’s medical condition had already established the need for surgery.

18     In this regard, the evidence of the two experts, Dr Hee Hwan Tak (“Dr Hee”) and Dr Chang Wei Chun (“Dr Chang”) were divided on the need for future surgery. In his medical report of 8 December 2018, Dr Chang stated as follows:

> Presently, he does not require any surgical intervention to his back, such as L4-5 decompression and fusion. The likelihood in the future is less than 50%.

19     Dr Hee, in his medical report of 22 August 2017, opined that the likelihood of a future lumbar spine operation was more 50%. That said, in his testimony, Dr Hee’s did not say that surgery was _a certainty[^1]_:

> Decision for surgery is pretty much joint decision between doctor and patient. In this particular case, I think conservative treatment is still ongoing, and **option for surgery is still kept open** should the patient feel quality of life is significantly curtailed despite conservative treatment. It is already **5 years post-accident**, what we just heard is that patient intends to try to stick to conservative as much as he can, but nevertheless as time goes on, as his condition deteriorates further, **there is still a chance that he may still require surgery**. But must emphasise that this is still very much a joint decision.

> …

> **Certainly mainstay should be non-surgical**. That is basic principle of management of lumbar spine problems. But we must also give **surgery as an option** for the patient to turn to **should one day the situation and need arise**. And that patient should also understand that. It is an informed decision from the patient whether to proceed with surgery.

\[emphasis added\]

20     As the appellant’s treating physician, Dr Hee has stated that the mainstay of the appellant’s future medical care should be non-surgical but there was a chance that the appellant _may_ require surgery and that it was _an option_ should the need arise. I therefore respectfully disagreed with appellant’s counsel submission that surgery was a certainty and therefore required based on the appellant’s current medical condition. Using Dr Hee’s own words of “a chance” that the appellant may require surgery and that it was “an option”, this is precisely the scenario which lends itself to the Court of Appeal’s application of the appreciable risk principle set out in _Lua_. The evidence of the experts would then be relevant in ascertaining the appreciable risk for future surgery. The DR applied the appreciable risk in arriving at his figure of $10,000 at \[29\] of his GD:

> Beginning with a range of $28,000 to $33,000 as the cost of decompression and fusion surgery, I consider reasonable a discount between 65% and 75%. In percentage terms this is a larger discount than that I applied in respect of the cost of future acupuncture, and I regard this as appropriate because surgery is a more invasive and drastic measure than acupuncture. This means, first, that the plaintiff is less likely to elect to undergo surgery than he is to choose to undergo acupuncture, and second, that if the surgery does take place it will most likely occur further in the future than any course of acupuncture treatment. This latter point means in turn that the plaintiff enjoys greater benefit in obtaining accelerated receipt of damages in respect of anticipated surgical expense he has not yet incurred than in respect of expected acupuncture cost, which entails a correspondingly larger discount to negate that benefit. Doing the arithmetic this produces a range of $7,000 to $11,550, and working within that range I assess damages for the cost of future surgery at $10,000.

21     As highlighted from Dr Hee’s evidence, the mainstay for the appellant’s treatment was non-surgical but there was _a chance_ of future surgery as an option. As such, I did not see any reason to disturb the DR’s quantification on the basis of an appreciable risk of future surgery.

22     As for the future cost of medication, the DR made the following finding in his GD at \[22\]:

> **On the basis of Dr Hee’s evidence I accept that there is a possibility that the plaintiff’s lower back condition may hereafter deteriorate. I am thus satisfied that there is an “appreciable risk” that the plaintiff will have to spend more on medication in the future than he has hitherto done, and so I do not think that the defendant’s primary submission of $175.11 is adequate**. But at the same time I think that Dr Hee’s estimate is excessive because the infrequency with which medication has been prescribed to the plaintiff up to this point, so many years after the accident, strongly suggests a significant probability that he will not after all need to take Arcoxia and Lyrica once every two or three days as Dr Hee postulates he will. This means that a hefty downward adjustment to Dr Hee’s figure of $4,800 is called for. Using a broad brush I consider that Dr Chang’s estimate of $2,000, which represents a discount of 58.3% from Dr Hee’s, is quite reasonable and so I assess the future cost of medication at $2,000.

\[emphasis added\]

23     The DR accepted Dr Hee’s evidence that there was _a possibility_ of appellant’s lower back condition deteriorating resulting in the appellant having to spend more in the future on medication than he has done. The DR then adjusted the figure as he felt that Dr Hee’s estimate was excessive as there was a “significant probability that he will not after all need to take Arcoxia and Lyrica once every two or three days as Dr Hee postulates he will.”

24     In other words, the DR applied the appreciable risk test as set out in _Lua_ on the basis that the additional spending on medication in the future was a possibility. As such, I saw no reason to disturb the DR’s finding.

25     As for the future cost of acupuncture, it was not in dispute that the appellant had not thus far gone for acupuncture. The DR made the following finding in his GD at \[24\]:

> On the evidence before me it appears that the defendant is correct to say that the plaintiff has not gone for acupuncture thus far. But it does not follow in my view that there is no “appreciable risk” of the plaintiff doing so in the future. Although I have not been able to find that it was reasonable for the plaintiff to have sought chiropractic treatment starting in late 2019, the fact that he sought that treatment of his own accord demonstrates to me that he is keen to explore all conceivable non-invasive means of alleviating his back pain. **It therefore seems to me that there is a reasonable chance that the plaintiff will decide in the future to try acupuncture, and consequently I find that there is an appreciable risk that he will in the future incur loss in the form of the cost of acupuncture.**

\[emphasis added\]

26     The DR proceeded to make a downward adjustment which also took into account that fact that the appellant had a pre-existing degeneration in his lumbar spine. As the future cost of acupuncture was not a certainty but one which there was a reasonable chance which the appellant may undergo, I saw no reason to disturb the finding and the DR’s quantification in this regard.

27     As such, I agreed with the DR’s interpretation of the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Lua’s case_ that the appreciable risk test was meant to apply to _all future losses_ and I accordingly upheld the DR’s quantification for these heads of damages for future medical expenses.

## Loss of Earning capacity

### Principles for award of loss of earning capacity

28     In _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“_Chai Kang Wei Samuel”)_ the Court of Appeal set out the principles on which loss of earning capacity may be awarded at \[36\]:

> …an award for loss of earning capacity (in the context where the plaintiff is currently employed) can only be awarded **_if there is a substantial or real risk_** **that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life** **and** **that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market**. It is a **cumulative test**… Following from this, **no award for loss of earning capacity should be granted if there is no risk of the Respondent’s post-accident employment being terminated.**

\[emphasis added\]

29     The Court of Appeal in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel_ approved the following statement by Brown LJ in _Moeliker v A Reyrolle and Co Ltd_ \[1977\] 1 All ER 9 at \[17\]:

> **The consideration of this head of damages should be made in two stages**. 1. Is there **a ‘substantial’ or ‘real’ risk that a plaintiff will lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life?** 2. If there is (**_but not otherwise_**), the court must assess and quantify **the present value of the risk of the financial damage which the plaintiff will suffer if that risk materialises, having regard to the degree of the risk, the time when it may materialise, and the factors, both favourable and unfavourable, which in a particular case will, or may, affect the plaintiff’s chances of getting a job at all, or an equally well paid job.** \[emphasis added\]

30     In _Moeliker_ Brown LJ held at \[16\]:

> **Where a plaintiff is in work at the date of the trial, the first question on this head of damage is: what is the risk that he will, at some time before the end of his working life, lose that job and be thrown on the labour market**? I think the question is whether this is a ‘substantial’ risk or is it a ‘speculative’ or ‘fanciful’ risk (see _Davies v Taylor_ per Lord Reid (\[1972\] 3 All ER 836 at 838, <span class="citation">\[1974\] AC 207</span> at 212) and Lord Simon of Glaisdale (\[1972\] 3 All ER 836 at 844, <span class="citation">\[1974\] AC 207</span> at 220)). Scarman LJ in _Smith v Manchester Corp_ ((1974) 17 KIR 1) referred to a ‘real’ risk, which I think is the same test. In deciding this question all sorts of factors will have to be taken into account, varying almost infinitely with the facts of particular cases. **For example, the nature and prospects of the employers’ business; the plaintiff’s age and qualifications; his length of service; his remaining length of working life; the nature of his disabilities; and any undertaking or statement of intention by his employers as to his future employment. If the court comes to the conclusion that there is no ‘substantial’ or ‘real’ risk of the plaintiff’s losing his present job in the rest of his working life, no damages will be recoverable under this head**.

> \[emphasis added\]

31     While not disputing the principles set out in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel_ and _Moeliker_, appellant’s counsel submitted that there had been a number of cases where loss of earning capacity had been awarded by the courts so long as some disability has been shown. In this regard, she referred to the cases of _Nirumalan Kanapathy Pillay v Teo Eng Chuan_ \[2003\] 3 SLR (R) 601 _(“Nirumalan Kanapathy Pillay”_), _Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 178</span> _(“Ronnie Tan”_), _Karuppiah Nirmala v Singapore Bus Services Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 934</span> _(“Karuppiah Nirmala”_), _Clark Jonathan Michael v Lee Khee Chung_ \[2010\] 1 SLR _(“Clark Jonathan Michael”_) and _Mukhtiar Singh v Balwyndarjeet Singh_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] SGHC 192</span> _(“Mukhtiar Singh”)._

### Decision on loss of earning capacity

32     The DR declined to make an award for loss of earning capacity. In declining to do so, the DR stated at \[17\] of his GD:

> In the circumstances the plaintiff has not succeeded in showing either that the residual effects of the injuries caused by the accident reduce his ability to do the work of a commercial pilot or that those effects independently reduce the likelihood of commercial airlines hiring him as a pilot. I am therefore not satisfied that the accident has caused the plaintiff any disadvantage that will afflict him when he enters the labour market following his retirement from the RSAF, and so I find that the accident has caused the plaintiff no loss of earning capacity for which the defendant should compensate him and I do not award any damages under this head of claim.

33     Appellant’s counsel accepted that the conditions as set out in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel_ for an award of loss of earning capacity were cumulative, namely that “there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life _and_ that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market.”

34     While she conceded that there was no imminent risk of the appellant losing his current job with the RSAF, her submission was that upon retirement from the RSAF at age 50 and before the end of his working life, he would be substantially disadvantaged “in the open labour market” by the residual effects of the injuries he sustained in the accident. In this regard, the appellant had explained that becoming a commercial pilot was a “likely option” for him, and that his ability to perform that job will be compromised in that he will “experience difficulty when flying commercial flights because of the exacerbation of \[his\] back after prolonged sitting, … especially when the duration of the flight is long”.

35     Appellant’s counsel further submitted that the appellant would have to undergo further surgery and would have to take a further 4 months off to recover from his surgery, which would negatively impact his performance upon evaluation by his superiors.

36     The appellant’s injuries have been set out by Dr Hee in his medical report of 22 August 2017 where he stated as follows:

> His disability for activities of daily living include low back pain upon lifting moderately heavy loads of 10 to 15 kg. He is also unable to it for prolonged periods of time, lest there be aggravation of the low back pain.

> He is able to resume his normal duties. However it is likely that he will continue major relapses or recurrences of the symptoms. My professional opinion is that he may not be able to function fully as a combat pilot in the future.

> He may be able to work as a commercial pilot as the physical demands on the neck and back are less than that of a combat pilot. Nevertheless, he may experience exacerbation of back and perhaps neck pain during the course of work as a commercial pilot.

37     It was also not in contention that neither the appellant’s current job or any possible future job would entail him having to lift moderately heavy loads of 10 to 15 kg.

38     Appellant’s counsel conceded that notwithstanding his injuries, there was little risk of him losing his job in the RSAF. Further, it was not in dispute that the appellant’s RSAF career continued on an upward progression since the accident, where he was presently a formation commander and was promoted to the senior rank of Brigadier-General in 2020.

39     As to whether being a commercial pilot was the only option after the appellant retired from the RSAF, the appellant’s evidence was also that once he achieved the rank of Colonel he did not have to fly (NE page 15-16):

> Q    After mid-2015, how many flights did you do every month?

> A     **I did not have to fly because I have achieved Colonel rank.** But as senior officer I get to fly a few times a year, perhaps once a quarter or once every half-year, to keep current with developments. There is no fixed schedule.

> \[emphasis added\]

40     In other words, given the appellant’s current seniority in the RSAF, he was in a senior management position and was not required to operate as a combat pilot. As such, the appellant’s current job involved little flying and was mainly deskbound, which meant that a commercial pilot was a _possible_ future career option for the appellant but not the _only_ option. The appellant is eminently qualified and was the recipient of the prestigious SAF Overseas Scholarship and obtained a BSc Electrical Engineering as well as a double MBA from NTU-Nanyang Waseda. The appellant also agreed that while he was an operationally ready pilot, his expertise would be more on leadership, management and command ability[^2].

41     In this regard, the DR was of the view that any diminution in his efficiency and productivity at deskbound jobs was “ultimately insignificant” and would not affect in any discernible manner his ability to accept and assume the kind of senior management duties he might reasonably expect to be offered given his qualifications and experience” as elaborated at \[13\] of his GD:

> I think it clear that becoming a commercial pilot is not the plaintiff’s only option for post-RSAF employment. The plaintiff acknowledged this in cross-examination by Mr Koh. Given the leadership and management positions he has held and is holding in the RSAF, and given also that he was a recipient earlier in life of the prestigious Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarship, it seems likely that there will be businesses and organisations in the private or public sectors willing to offer him jobs in senior management after his departure from the RSAF. I consider that the residual effects of the injuries from the accident will not hinder him in any substantial way in carrying out those types of jobs. Although the plaintiff said in his affidavits of evidence-in-chief that his “efficiency and productivity” would be diminished even in relation to wholly deskbound jobs because he will “experience pain when \[he does\] paperwork and sit\[s\] down for prolonged periods of time” and so “have to take frequent breaks”, on the evidence before me it appears that notwithstanding the accident he has in the five years since then remained able to perform demanding high-level leadership roles in the RSAF to at least a satisfactory standard. From this I infer that any diminution in his efficiency and productivity at deskbound jobs is ultimately insignificant and will not affect in any discernible manner his ability to accept and assume the kind of senior management duties he might reasonably expect to be offered given his qualifications and experience.

42     In my view, in deciding whether an award should be made for loss of earning capacity, there is a logic as to why the conditions for such an award of loss of earning capacity as set out in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel_ are cumulative, namely that “there is a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life _and_ that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market.” The logic being that the injuries sustained by a appellant would be serious enough to affect his performance in his pre-accident job and disadvantage him in the open employment market should he lose that job. Even if the risk of the appellant losing his job was not imminent, the appellant would need to show that the injury would disadvantage him in the job market should he be thrown in the labour market at a future point in time.

43     In the present case, the appellant had not demonstrated how his injuries were serious enough to have disadvantaged him in the RSAF. He would then need to demonstrate that the accident would disadvantage him in future jobs post retirement from the RSAF.

44     As discussed above, being a commercial pilot is not the appellant’s only option and the appellant conceded that his expertise would be more on leadership, management and command ability. Further. there was evidence of the appellant’s predecessors who, after retiring from the same senior position as the appellant in the RSAF, moved on to helm jobs in senior management in corporations as well as a career in politics[^3]. Given that the appellant’s current job earning capacity had not been affected by the accident, I find that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that on an extrapolation into the future, his earning capacity for future jobs would be reduced by the accident.

45     I then considered the cases cited by the appellant’s counsel where loss of earning capacity had been awarded by the courts.

46     In _Nirumalan Kanapathy Pillay_ the court noted at \[26\] that there was “clear evidence that the plaintiff had cut back on his court work since the accident, and that he cannot work the same hours that he did before.” While the court noted that his income had not dropped after the accident, the court found at \[29\] that “there is no doubt that the plaintiff’s injuries did affect his ability to work” and that “when that continues and his input to the firm is reduced, it is likely that he may have to reduce his share of the firm’s earnings or retire earlier than he would have liked if he had not been injured.”

47     In _Ronnie Tan_ the court referred to the plaintiff’s evidence that he was working at a much slower pace and his condition affected his ability to conduct long trials as a litigation lawyer, including giddiness and spinning which required him to lie down or sit down and that but for the accident, he would have been able to earn more than what he did since the accident.

48     In _Karuppiah Nirmala_ the court found that the plaintiff’s ability to earn a good income may be limited from time to time by the aftereffects of the accident, and accordingly an award for loss of earning capacity was reasonable.

49     In _Clark Jonathan Michael_ the court accepted the Assistant Registrar’s (“the AR”) finding that the plaintiff’s evidence that he would have difficulty in relation to his employment and future career. The court also accepted that the medical evidence had established that the plaintiff had permanent disabilities of a nature which could interfere with his work performance and found that the AR’s award for loss of earning capacity was reasonable.

50     In _Mukhtiar Singh_ the plaintiff had lost his right thumb in the accident which resulted in a 50% loss in the function of his right hand. He was unable to perform his duties as an aircraft technician after the accident as the job required rotary functions of his right thumb. While he did not suffer a loss in salary, he would receive a lower pay supplement than what he would have received as an aircraft technician. The court in awarding loss of earning capacity, noted at \[51\] that the plaintiff’s handicap was permanent and he would have difficulty finding a job that would pay him as well as if he could have the complete use of his right hand.

51     In my view, the common thread that ran through all these cases was that on the evidence, the plaintiffs’ disabilities had impacted the plaintiff performance at work _so as to reduce his earning capacity_. In the present case, there was no evidence to show that the appellant’s current earning capacity in the RSAF had been impacted by the injuries. As discussed above, he had continued to progress in his RSAF career after the accident. There was also no evidence that the appellant would have done even better career wise in the RSAF but for the accident. I therefore agreed with the DR’s finding that “any diminution in his efficiency and productivity at deskbound jobs was ultimately insignificant and would not affect in any discernible manner his ability to accept and assume the kind of senior management duties he might reasonably expect to be offered given his qualifications and experience.”

## Conclusion

52     As I affirmed the DR’s decision with regard to future medical expenses and loss of earning capacity, the appellant’s appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs.
