11 March 2022

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused, Perez Ryan Edward Poquiz (“Perez”) claimed trial to a single charge. The Charge alleged that Perez had, in the early hours on 11 January 2019, at the address he resided at, caused another man (“V”) to penetrate (Perez’s) mouth with the penis of V, without V’s consent.

2       After hearing all the evidence and the submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence, I found that the Prosecution had proven its case against Perez, beyond a reasonable doubt. I convicted Perez accordingly. Perez was guilty of an offence under s 376(1)(b) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code. This particular sub-section, s 376(1)(b), made it an offence for any man (“A”) who causes another man (“B”) to penetrate, with B’s penis, the anus or mouth of A, where B did not consent to the penetration. The punishment prescribed was imprisonment for a term of up to 20 years; the offender would also be liable to fine or to caning.

3       After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution and the Defence (as well as the Mitigation Plea filed by the Defence), I sentenced Perez to imprisonment for a term of 7 years, and 3 strokes of the cane. The imprisonment term was backdated to 11 January 2019, the date of Perez’s arrest.

4       Perez appealed against the conviction and the sentence. He is currently serving sentence.

5       There was, and is, a Gag Order protecting the identities of V and a lady I shall refer to as “GF”. GF was the girlfriend of V at the time of the offence. GF gave evidence at the trial of Perez. By the time of the trial, V and GF were a married couple.

6       V, who hails from a European country, was at the time of the offence, a 25-year-old man, and a tourist in Singapore. V travelled to Singapore on his own. V had met Perez in person, only two days prior to the date of the offence. V and Perez had made contact earlier, online, through an online application called CouchSurfing. Briefly, CouchSurfing allowed member travellers to arrange free accommodation in the country they were intending to visit, with willing member hosts whose schedules permitted the intended arrangement. The host would offer free accommodation (usually in the host’s residence) to the traveller, and this facility could be reciprocated should the host intend, in future, to visit the traveller’s home country. The free accommodation offered could take the form of a discrete bedroom, or perhaps a couch in the living room, or in a shared room with separate beds, or in a shared room on a shared bed. There was opportunity for the host to accompany the visitor around the city being visited.

7       V and Perez first met on 9 January 2019. The two men interacted socially on that day, and nothing excessively untoward occurred. The evidence indicated that V had made known the fact that he had a girlfriend at that time. The sleeping arrangement provided by Perez involved the sharing of a bed in the room Perez rented. V was aware of this arrangement and had agreed to it.

8       The next day, 10 January 2019 was to be V’s final day in Singapore before his planned departure (on 11 January 2019) to attend his girlfriend’s graduation in a neighbouring Asian country. Perez and V had had drinks in the evening of 10 January 2019 before the two returned to Perez’s residence for the night.

9       It was V’s evidence that he had fallen asleep and was awakened (in the early hours of the morning of 11 January 2019) by Perez performing fellatio on him. There was no dispute that fellatio had occurred when Perez caused V’s penis to penetrate his (Perez) mouth. The material point in dispute was whether V had consented to this particular act of Perez. V said that he had not consented, in fact, he was not even aware that Perez was committing the act as he (V) had been asleep just prior to his discovery of the act.

10     It was the case of the Defence that V had initially consented to the fellatio then withdrew the consent. The Defence suggested to V that he was having “sexual guilt” and was experiencing “sexual regret”. V clearly rejected these allegations.

11     This was the case of the Defence. The Defence contended that whilst the two men were lying on the bed together, Perez started to touch and caress V’s arm. V then reciprocated the caress. The two then moved to face each other and started French kissing each other. During the kissing, Perez touched V’s penis from outside the boxers V was wearing. V’s penis was erect. After V’s penis was stroked by Perez, V then turned to lie on his back. V was breathing heavily and was sexually aroused. Perez moved towards V’s penis and then proceeded to pull V’s boxers down. It was difficult to pull the boxers down, and V assisted Perez to do so. The Defence contended that “everything happened spontaneously” with V’s penis now being fully exposed and erect. Perez then started to fellate V for about 10 seconds. Then, “suddenly”, V withdrew his consent and immediately pulled up his boxers, because, as the Defence contended, “at that point in time, (V) regretted (V’s) action”, and this, amounted to “sexual regret”.

12     V denied the version of events put forward by the Defence (save for the act of fellatio which physical act was not in dispute). It is to be noted that it was not the Defence’s contention that V had verbally consented to the fellatio. It appeared to be the case of the Defence that the consent of V to the fellatio could be inferred from the alleged actions of V, and the alleged reactions (or absence thereof) of V to the actions of Perez. It had to be borne in mind as well, that consent to a particular sexual act may not necessarily equate to consent to a different sexual act.

13     After considering all the evidence and the respective closing submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence, I found that V had been an unusually convincing witness. This finding was necessary as this had essentially been a case of one person’s word against another’s. I found that Perez had initiated the act of fellatio when V was asleep and not capable of giving consent, and indeed, had not given any express consent to the fellatio. I rejected the version put forward by the Defence. I found that there had been no conscious physical contact, or conscious or consensual sexual activity between the two men until Perez performed the act of fellatio (which V was initially not aware of as he was asleep, and for which he had not consented). V had been asleep when Perez commenced fellating V. The finding was that there had been no consent to the fellatio nor could consent have been inferred in the circumstances. Perez was thus found guilty and convicted accordingly. Before delivering the Verdict, I made a few brief oral remarks. The material portions are contained in \[14\] to \[20\] below.

14     “I am just going to give a few brief oral remarks before delivering the verdict in this matter. These do not constitute full grounds of decision and may be added to or elaborated upon should the need arise. Simply put in this case, there was no dispute that fellatio had occurred. The only issue in dispute was whether the alleged victim had consented to the fellatio. Primarily, this was an issue of one man’s word against another’s. In order to convict, the Court must find in circumstances such as these that the evidence of the alleged victim was unusually convincing. The Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

15     “To home in again on the material points in dispute, the alleged victim denies the acts prior to the admitted fellatio. The accused claimed that certain acts preceded the act of fellatio and amounted to consent being given by the alleged victim and that the alleged victim then withdrew his previously given consent to the act of fellatio. The evidence showed that the accused was bisexual and the alleged victim was heterosexual.

16     “The material aspects of the evidence of the alleged victim were that he was asleep and had been awakened by the act of fellatio being performed on him. The alleged victim denied all the prior acts which the accused asserted had occurred. Upon the consideration of all the evidence, I found the account of the alleged victim to be the one to be believed. The alleged victim’s immediate reaction upon discovering the act of fellatio indicated that the alleged victim had not given consent to the fellatio. The evidence was that the alleged victim had uttered “what the” and immediately pulled up his boxers. This shocked reaction indicated strongly that the alleged victim had just discovered that an act to which he had not consented to was being performed on him. He was also not aware that the act was being performed until he awoke from it as he had been asleep just prior.

17     “Taken at its highest, the case of the accused was that he had assumed that the alleged victim had consented to the fellatio. There was simply no evidence that the alleged victim had specifically consented to fellatio being performed on him, nor was there any evidence that the alleged victim had verbally signalled consent to fellatio. Upon a full consideration of the evidence, the suggestion that the alleged victim had experienced sexual regret was dismissed. I had found the account of the alleged victim to be consistent, cogent, and convincing.

18     “There was no evidence that the alleged victim was bi-curious and the evidence pointedly showed that the alleged victim would not have consented to any homosexual activity. Again, taken at the highest, the accused had been reckless in his alleged assumption that the alleged victim had consented to the fellatio. The evidence showed that previous homosexual activity the accused had with couch surfers had been planned and consent had been obvious and expressed. To be clear, my finding is that the alleged victim’s account is to be believed over the version of the accused. There had been no consent, expressed or implied, to the fellatio. The reactions of the alleged victim after the act were also consistent with a person in distress after an unwanted sexual act had been performed on him. I agreed with the Prosecution on this point.

19     “The internet searches carried out by the alleged victim, the calling of the police, his communication with his close male friend, and his pained interactions with his girlfriend wherein he struggled with telling her what had truly happened against the backdrop of the surrounding circumstances at that time, all pointed to someone who had been sexually violated. Whilst there may have been some minor inconsistencies in the evidence of the alleged victim, his evidence surrounding the actual act for which the accused stands charged for was unshaken during Cross-Examination.

20     “The finding of fact is that, the alleged victim was not aware of the preparatory acts, in particular the pulling down of the boxers worn by the alleged victim carried out by the accused just prior to the admitted act of fellatio, and had not given his consent whether implied or expressed to the fellatio. The alleged victim simply had no reason to fabricate his account. I accepted his telling of the events which had a clear ring of truth about it. The alleged victim simply had no reason to falsely implicate the accused. His reporting to the police could well have jeopardised his planned and warmly anticipated attendance at the graduation of his girlfriend in (a neighbouring Asian country). His actions in, inter alia, reporting to the police were indicative of the reactions of someone who had been sexually violated knowing that he had not consented to the act in question. The alleged victim was unusually convincing. The Prosecution had proven its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I, therefore, find the accused guilty of the charge and convict him accordingly.”

21     As a starting point, I was of the view that the case for the Defence, taken at its highest, did not afford Perez a defence to the charge he faced. It was clear that V had not, at any point in time, verbalised or positively indicated his consent to the particular sexual act of fellatio. Perez had simply inferred that V had consented, based on his (Perez) version of events (a version which had to be rejected, in any event). The “long” Statement of Perez was recorded on 11 January 2019 at 11.00 am. This Statement was admitted as a Defence exhibit as D2.

22     In D2, Perez stated that he is bisexual. Perez described his version of the events leading up to the fellatio. In \[9\] Perez stated, “Initially both of us were sleeping faced up. At one point, I turned to my right and spontaneously (V) turned to his left such that we were now facing each other. Subconsciously using my left hand, I touched his arm and stroked it. He also put his hand on my arm and stroked it. When he stroked my arm, I assumed that he was ok with it.”

23     As stated earlier, I had rejected Perez’s version of the actions of the two men just prior to the fellatio. Even if Perez’s version were to be accepted, his account thus far leads only to an assumption that V would have been “ok” with the mutual stroking of arms. This would have been a far cry from consent to fellatio, a far more intrusive and intimate sexual action.

24     Perez went on, “I moved my face closer to his and then we started French kissing. During the kissing, I touched his penis from the outside of his boxer and felt that it was erected (_sic_). After I stroked his penis, (V) turned to lie on his back again.” Even if Perez’s version were to be accepted, consent (if any) may be claimed to have been present in relation to French kissing and the touching of the penis with the hand(s). It has to be emphasised that I rejected Perez’s version of events leading up to the fellatio.

25     After V allegedly “turned to lie on his back again”, Perez stated in D2, that “I took it as an indication that he (V) was giving me the go ahead to give him a blow job.” Even if there had been consent to the stroking of arms, French kissing and the touching of (V’s) penis by the hand(s) of Perez, it was not a given that that amounted to consent to fellatio. The evidence indicated that Perez was given to understand that V was heterosexual and not bisexual, and would not have agreed to homosexual sexual activity. There was no indication that V was bi-curious. There was no indication that V would have agreed to sexual experimentation on his part.

26     Perez went on to say, “So I moved lower and using my left hand, pulled his boxers down from the front. (V) assisted by pulling his boxers down from the left and right sides.”

27     In \[10\] of D2, Perez stated, “When his (V) penis was fully exposed and stood erect, I proceeded to give him a blowjob which lasted about 10 seconds before (V) explained (_sic_) “What the,” and he immediately pulled his boxers up. **That was when I realized that he was apparently not fully conscious of what was happening from the time we kissed to the time that I gave him the blowjob.**” (emphasis in bold added).

28     The recording of D2 (occurring the same morning of the date of the offence: very shortly after the offence) would have, in this case, accurately stated Perez’s candid realisation that V was not in a physical and mental state to express consent. It did not gel with the case theory of the Defence at trial that V had consented to the fellatio, then withdrew said consent upon his feeling “sexual regret” or “sexual guilt”.

29     The shocked realisation on V’s part came only after 10 seconds from the onset of the action, as V had been asleep just prior. V had been roused from his slumber by the actions of Perez fellating him.

30     Later, the two men met in the corridor outside the residence. In \[12\] of D2, Perez relates, “(V) first responded to me asking if I was crazy. I saw that he had a very disappointed look on his face. He affirmed with me if I remember what happened. **I told him that I was sorry and that I had assumed that he was ok with it. He then responded saying that he definitely not ok with it as he was not into gay activities and that he has a girlfriend back home.**” (emphasis in bold added).

31     Perez’s assumption (\[30\] above) was without sufficient basis. Perez’s apology supports the contention that Perez had realised that he (Perez) had no basis for assuming that V had consented to the fellatio.

32     Perez continued in \[12\] of D2, “So I asked him if he remembered what we did before the blowjob and he said he did not remember. I went on to explain that we had kissed and he had stoked (_sic_) my arm and that was why I assumed that he was ok with it. (V) angrily replied that he did not remember kissing me and even if he did kiss me, that does not mean that he was ok to get a blowjob from me. **At that time, I was pretty sure that I had made a huge mistake assuming that was consent.**” (emphasis in bold added).

33     This buttresses the finding that V had been asleep and was awakened by the fellatio. V simply did not know, and could not know what Perez was doing to him. It could also be inferred that Perez came to the realisation that he had no basis for assuming that V had consented to the fellatio, leading to his (Perez) making the “huge mistake” in assuming that V had consented.

34     Further, in \[13\] of D2, Perez revealed his motives. He stated, “I wish to state that there was no discussion on the couch surfing app between (V) and I in relation to our gender preferences. Even during the time that we went out together, I had learnt that (V) had a girlfriend and he looked pretty straight. We did not discuss gender preferences. **It was just my own curiosity if he was bi-curious which means he is a straight man but also curious about same gender intimacy. It was purely my assumption and the kissing made me** (_sic_) **the confirmation** (_sic_) **that he was a consenting party. What I failed to realize is that he was not fully conscious when were** (_sic_) **stroked each other and kissed.** (emphasis in bold added).

35     Perez was curious about whether V was open to sexual experimentation, but had no basis for assuming that V was open to such experimentation. Perez knew that V was heterosexual and not bisexual. Relying on the alleged kissing was simply insufficient to have come to the conclusion that V had consented to fellatio. Perez further realised that V had been “not fully conscious” at the material time, just before V exclaimed “What the”. On this point, I accepted V’s evidence that he (V) had been asleep at that time and could not know what Perez was doing to him just prior to the act of fellatio.

36     Perez ends D2 in \[14\] with the following expression of remorse: “I am so so sorry for what I have done. I am very remorseful and ashamed. I wish I could make it up to (V) for what I have done to him but only by a pure mistaken assumption on my part. Again I am sorry.”

37     Even if Perez’s version of the events leading up to the fellatio were to be believed, the point to note is that Perez realised (and accepted) that V had not consented to the fellatio. And, if Perez’s version were accepted, did he have reasonable cause to have had a “pure mistaken assumption” or belief that V had consented to the fellatio? On a careful analysis of the circumstances surrounding the events and a close scrutiny of Perez’s version, the answer would have to be “no”. Even if there had been a mutual stroking of arms, some French kissing, the contact of Perez’s hands with V’s penis and the pulling down of the boxer shorts, exposing an erect penis, this did not amount to consent specifically to fellatio, unless V had verbalised his consent thereto or did some overt act, perhaps, say, by guiding Perez’s head towards V’s penis.

38     In his cautioned statement (recorded on the same date, 11 January 2019 at 9.10 pm, and admitted as D3), Perez stated that he “didn’t do it intentionally with wanting to have sex with him. It was a misconception of the actions leading to event which I have mentioned in my statement. I’m referring to the stroking and kissing that made me believe he permitted it even though he never said yes. ….. It was a mistake I made which I regret.”

39     Perez had, again in D3, affirmed that V had never consented to the fellatio.

40     Upon being charged in Court for this offence, Perez was ordered to be examined at the Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre by an Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) psychiatrist. The report of the IMH psychiatrist was admitted as D4.

41     In D4, Perez is reported to have informed the psychiatrist (in \[13\]) that he (Perez) had had three sexual encounters with adult males he had hosted through CouchSurfing. Crucially, “(these) encounters were consensual and were discussed upon prior to attempting sexual intercourse”.

42     The description of the alleged events leading up to the fellatio is set out in \[19\] of D4. Perez reported that he had been “half-asleep” and “half-conscious” when the alleged physical contact between the two men began. Perez “commenced to perform a “blow job” (fellatio) on (V) for about 10 seconds. Suddenly (V) sat up and said “what the …” and pulled up his own (V’s) boxers.” Again, crucially, it was stated (at \[19\] in D4,), “At that point, (Perez) realised the act was “not permitted” by (V) and did not continue.” V simply did not consent to the fellatio, and Perez acknowledged it.

43     I found V to be a candid witness, whose evidence had been consistent, cogent and convincing. Whilst there may have been slight inconsistencies with parts of his evidence, these did not relate to the crucial points of his account of the fateful night. His evidence on the main, material aspects of the Prosecution’s case was unshaken under cross examination.

44     The evidence was clear that V had fallen asleep, and he was awakened by Perez’s act of fellatio. By the time V was roused from his slumber, Perez had been fellating V for about 10 seconds. V’s immediate and shocked reaction was to exclaim “what the” and immediately pull up the boxer shorts that had been pulled down by Perez. V could not have known, and did not know what Perez had done to him prior to his startled rouse from sleep.

45     V simply had no reason to fabricate his account. Reporting the incident to the Police when he did, could have meant V missing a warmly anticipated event – that of GF’s graduation in a neighbouring Asian country. V had no reason to falsely implicate Perez. Indeed, V and GF resided out of jurisdiction and came to Singapore to give evidence at great (opportunity) cost to themselves (especially with regard to GF’s studies).

46     V’s various acts just after the fellatio are indicative of the reactions of a person in distress who had just been sexually violated. A video of the confrontation of the two men in the corridor outside the residential unit was admitted into evidence: the transcript of the verbal exchanges was admitted as P3.

47     The transcript P3 shows (from the portion where the confrontation is captured in the video) V saying, “I mean you went crazy huh”, to which Perez answers, “Sorry”. When Perez tried to assert that certain actions had occurred, V had denied this.

48     The evidence also showed that V had, very soon after the offence had occurred, been carrying out Internet searches in his bid to find the best way to communicate with the Police to report the sexual assault. Reference is made to Annex D of P2. Searches on keywords such as “sleep blowjob gay rape help”, “Singapore rape victim”, blowjob during sleep rape proof”, “blowjob sleep rape proof saliver (_sic_)”, “Singapore police force”, “call Singapore police”, “couchsurfing sexual assault” together indicate V’s state of mind just after the sexual assault. He had also been concerned whether there was a need for physical proof of the act and so some of his searches involved saliva. Clearly, V had experienced a sexual assault where Perez had performed fellatio on him without his knowledge and without his consent.

49     So desperate was V to make a police report of some form that he had to urgently ask GF to send him funds as he was low on funds. (A further consideration of his interactions with GF will be touched on, later.)

50     A forensic inspection of V’s handphone revealed that V had composed a message intended to be sent to the Police (this message was unsent, but again the text clearly shows V’s frame of mind at that time). In this unsent message, V had written, “Hello, 15 mins ago I (male) woke up realising that my friend and host here in Singapore was giving me a blow job. I hadn’t consented. I’m heterosexual. I haven’t washed my penis since this. I am a bit unable to cope with it. Is it possible to take a probe of the dna on my genitalia to detect his dna there? Or would that be a lost cause?” A police report was subsequently made and this is seen as P6 which is the First Information Report (“FIR”). The FIR was time-stamped as 11 January 2019, 3.26 am. The text of the message in the FIR was, “I was sexually assaulted by the house owner.”

51     Further evidence of V’s state of distress at that time can be seen from his self-journaled thoughts – the translation of which is found in P9. His journaled thoughts reveal a person who had just been violated and his feelings of having been violated are palpable. V had also confided in a male friend about his ordeal: he could not bring himself to reveal what had just happened to him, to GF.

52     The text exchanges between V and GF are found in Annex F of P2. V simply could not bring himself to reveal to GF what had just happened to him. GF had a graduation and thereafter some examination to tackle shortly thereafter. V did not want to affect GF’s mood in any way with the bad news that he carried in secret. His text exchanges shortly after the offence had occurred, suggest he was trying to act normally: he was putting on a brave front. When he asked GF to urgently transfer money to his telephone number, he avoided having to tell GF why he urgently needed the funds.

53     When GF asked V if he was “okay”, he applied in the affirmative, but said that he would “tell you later”. In further exchanges, V sought reassurances of GF’s love for him. V declined to tell GF the real reason he had missed his flight to where GF was. GF, sensing that all was not right with V, pestered V to tell her more. V tried to deflect and GF persisted. V subsequently lost his temper with GF over the text messages.

54     A consideration of all the evidence clearly showed that V had had a rude shock when he was awakened in the wee hours of 11 January 2019. He had been asleep just prior to his awakening. He was awakened by the action of Perez performing fellatio on him. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case against Perez beyond a reasonable doubt. Even taking the case of the Defence at its highest, Perez’s version would not show that V had consented to the fellatio. The finding of fact was clear – V, having been asleep, could not know or be aware of the preparatory steps Perez had taken just prior to his taking V’s penis into his (Perez’s) mouth. V had not been aware of what was happening to him and had certainly not consented to the fellatio, whether directly, indirectly, or by inference.

55     Perez was therefore found guilty of the Charge and was convicted accordingly. I considered the Mitigation Plea. There was a lack of material that would qualify to be mitigating factors in the true sense. That the fellatio only lasted only approximately 10 seconds would not count as a mitigating factor: had V not awakened from his slumber and stopped the unwanted act, the fellatio would likely have continued. The fellatio was stopped when V came to his senses when he awoke and could realise what was happening to him.

56     Perez had in his statements in D2 and D3 expressed remorse for what he had done, after realising that V had not consented to the fellatio. Any mitigating value of such remorse would have diminished as Perez had claimed trial, causing V to, _inter alia_, have to re-live the ordeal that Perez had put him through.

57     In terms of sentencing, the Defence submitted for a sentence of “not more than 3 years (imprisonment) without any strokes of the cane”. The Prosecution submitted for a sentence “of at least 8 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane” and cited _Pram Nair v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> (“_Pram Nair_”) and _BPH v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 764</span> (“_BPH_”).

58     In _Pram Nair_, the Court of Appeal set out a sentencing framework for sexual penetration of the vagina using a finger (an offence of sexual assault by penetration under s 376 of the Penal Code) and prescribed three sentencing bands. For present purposes, we need only look at the lowest of the three bands, Band 1. The Court of Appeal set the “range of starting sentence” for Band 1 at “seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane” (at \[159\]).

59     Subsequently, in _BPH_, the Court of Appeal held that “the _Pram Nair_ sentencing framework applies to all permutations of sexual penetration in s 376 of the Penal Code” and that “there is no hierarchy of severity for the various permutations of sexual penetration in s 376 of the Penal Code”.

60     Hence the “range of starting sentence” for the offence in the present case would, as per _Pram Nair_, be “seven to ten years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane”. The submission of the Defence for a sentence of three years’ imprisonment represented a quantum (of imprisonment) of less than half of the prescribed starting point as held by _Pram Nair_ and _BPH_. Further, the Defence was submitting that there be no caning meted out. There was no basis, given the circumstances of the case, to formulate any support for the Defence’s submission on sentence.

61     Perez had taken advantage of V when V was most vulnerable. V was asleep at that time. Whilst V had earlier agreed to the sleeping arrangement, there would at the very least be a tacit agreement and understanding that Perez would not assault or violate V in any way. This was especially magnified given the close proximity that the sleeping arrangements placed the two men in. V had indicated that he was heterosexual and not bisexual. V had never given Perez the impression that he (V) was open to any form of sexual experimentation.

62     Upon a careful consideration of all the relevant material before me, I was of the view that a sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane was appropriate. Perez was sentenced accordingly and the imprisonment sentence was backdated to the date of arrest. It is to be noted that the imprisonment term of 7 years is at the lowest end of the Band 1 as set out in _Pram Nair_. The sentence of 3 strokes of the cane is below the starting point of 4 strokes of the cane as prescribed by _Pram Nair_.

63     Perez appealed against the conviction and the sentence. Perez is currently serving sentence.
