Contract – Breach of Contract – Defence of Oral Variation Contract – Misrepresentation

6 March 2020

### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## MC/MC 739/2019[^1]

## INTRODUCTION

1       The First Defendant and the Plaintiff entered into a 12-month[^2] distribution agreement (“Distribution Agreement”) whereby the First Defendant (referred to as “DISTRIBUTOR” in the Distribution Agreement) was to distribute and sell Products formulated and manufactured by the Plaintiff (referred to as “OWNER” in the Distribution Agreement).[^3] The effective date of this Agreement was 8 August 2018.[^4]

2       The Second Defendant was a guarantor of the First Defendant’s obligations under the Distribution Agreement.[^5]

## The Distribution Agreement

3       Under this Distribution Agreement, the First Defendant was to fulfil “Minimum Performance Requirements”, which is defined as “those minimum annual performance targets required to be satisfied by the DISTRIBUTOR as set out more specifically in Clause 3.1”.[^6]

4       Clause 3.1 provides:

> The initial term of this Agreement shall come into effect on the Effective Date \[i.e., 8 August 2018[^7]\] and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, shall continue in full force until expiry of the Term, by which DISTRIBUTOR shall have sold at least 6,500 bottles of the Product.

5       The other terms of the Distribution Agreement relevant to the issues before the Court are as set out:

> 4.2    At the outset of the Agreement, OWNER shall supply DISTRIBUTOR with pre-packaged and labelled Product at prices applicable thereto for the Territory as set forth in the price list, the current form of which is attached as Schedule A hereto.

> 4.3    DISTRIBUTOR shall place firm written orders with OWNER on DISTRIBUTOR’S purchase order forms for the quantity of Product to be purchased as follows:

>> (a)    1st 3 months from the Effective Date \[by 7 Nov 2018\]: 1,000

>> (b)    2nd 3 months from the Effective Date \[by 7 Feb 2019\]: 2,000

>> (c)    Remainder of the Term \[by 7 Aug 2019\]: 3,500

> 5.2    For each Order, the Parties agree that DISTRIBUTOR shall make payment of S$20 upon picking up by DISTRIBUTOR of the Products orders, and the remaining S$40 before the making of the next Order; or before the expiry of 3 months from the receipt of the Products from the immediately preceding Order, whichever is earlier.

> 5.3    Payment in the manner described in Clause 5.2 above, shall be made by DISTRIBUTOR to OWNER upon delivery. DISTRIBUTOR will pay interest on overdue accounts at a rate of prime plus 6%. …

> Schedule A

> \* The S$120 – S$159 price is considered as promotional price.

> \*\* The S$160 price is considered the standard retail price.

6       Clause 15 of the Distribution Agreement deals with the Second Defendant’s obligations as a guarantor under the same Agreement.

7       The essence of the First Defendant’s obligations under the Distribution Agreement was that, for the duration of 12 months from 8 August 2018 while the Distribution Agreement was in force, the First Defendant should have minimally sold 6,500 of the Hebe Anti-aging Mist (“Product” or “Products”). The Plaintiff would supply the Product to the First Defendant at S$60 per Product and the First Defendant was to retail this at S$120 to S$160 per Product.

8       The Distribution Agreement also stipulates the frequency or intervals by which the First Defendant was to place orders for the Products from the Plaintiff. For the first 3 months from 8 August 2017, the First Defendant was to have ordered 1,000 Products; for the next 3 months, 2,000 Products, and for the remaining of the duration of the Distribution Agreement, 3,500 Products. This makes a total of 6,500 Products.

9       Where payment was concerned, the First Defendant was to pay S$20 upon collection of the Products. The balance of S$40 per Product was to be paid before the First Defendant made the next order or before the expiration of 3 months from receiving the order, whichever is the earlier.

## The Claim for Breach of Contract

10     As mentioned, the Distribution Agreement came into effect on 8 August 2018. On 16 August 2018, the First Defendant paid the Plaintiff a sum of S$21,400. This amount was the first S$20 per Product for the 1,000 Products that the First Defendant was to purchase and collect from the Plaintiff. It included GST at the rate of 7%. About one month after the signing of the Distribution Agreement, on 6 September 2018, the First Defendant collected 288 of the first batch of the 1,000 Products.

11     By 7 November 2018,[^8] the First Defendant was supposed to have collected the balance of the 1,000 Products, that is, 712 Products. But, that did not happen.

12     By 6 December 2018,[^9] the First Defendant was to have collected the balance of the first batch of Products, that is, 712 Products, _and_ to have paid the balance of S$40 per Product for the 1,000 Products plus GST, that is, S$42,800. But, that also did not happen.

13     As the First Defendant neither collected the 712 of the Products – being the balance of the first 1,000 Products – nor made payment of S$40 (and GST) per Product for the 288 Products earlier collected, the Plaintiff lodged the present claim against the First and Second Defendants for breach of the Distribution Agreement.

## The Defence of Oral Variation to the Contract

14     In their Defence,[^10] the Defendants argued that there was an oral variation of the Distribution Agreement which terms were –[^11]

> (a)     “\[t\]he \[First\] Defendant would first make payment for 1,000 Products at S$20 per Product”;

> (b)     “\[t\]he \[First\] Defendant would take collection of 288 Products” instead of 1,000 Products; and

> (c)     “\[t\]he \[First\] Defendant would make progressive payments for the remaining 1,000 (_sic_) Products once it managed to sell the first 288 Products\[ \]”

> (“the Oral Variation”)

15     It is the Defendants’ case that as a result of the Oral Variation of the terms of the Distribution Agreement, their obligations have not crystallised. It therefore flows that they are not in breach of the Distribution Agreement.

## The Counterclaim for Misrepresentation

16     The Defendants further averred that the Plaintiff had made representations to them, which, but for the representations which were allegedly misrepresentations, they would not have entered into the Distribution Agreement with the Plaintiff.

17     The alleged misrepresentations are:[^12]

> (a)     “that the Products were Products of Singapore” when they were in fact products of China;

> (b)     “that the Products could be exported and distributed without issue in Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Taiwan and the USA and would sell well”, but the Defendants instead found themselves having difficulty shipping the Products to Thailand;

> (c)     “that the shelf life of the Products would be in excess of two (2) years” when they in fact had less than 2 years’ shelf life; and

> (d)     “that the Products that would be sold to the \[First\] Defendant would be identical to the sample bottles the Defendants received” but they were not.

18     It is the Defendants’ case that they made these discoveries or realised the misrepresentations when they collected the 288 Products on 6 September 2018 and received the Products’ Material Safety Data Sheet (“MSDS”) on 17 September 2018, it is the Defendants’ case that that that was when they discovered or realised, _inter alia_, that[^13] –

> (a)     the Products were made in China and not Singapore;

> (b)     “\[t\]he Products were missing the Plaintiff’s sticker”; and

> (c)     the Products have a shelf life of less than 2 years.

19     The Defendants further, or in the alternative, claimed under section 2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap. 390, Rev Ed 1994).

20     Of the 288 Products that the First Defendants collected, as at the time of the filing of the Defence on 4 February 2019, only 15 Products had been sold.

## ISSUES

21     The issues that this Court has to address raises questions of facts. They are as follows:

> (a)     whether there was an Oral Variation of the terms of the Distribution Agreement;

> (b)     whether the Defendants had breached the terms of the Distribution Agreement; and

> (c)     whether the Distribution Agreement should be rescinded for misrepresentation.

## ISSUE 1: WHETHER THERE WAS AN ORAL VARIATION OF THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

22     It is trite to state that he who asserts must prove. This principle is enshrined in section 105 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, Rev Ed 1997) which provides most categorically that “\[t\]he burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who wishes the court to believe in its existence…”

23     As the Defendants are urging the Court to believe that there was an oral variation of the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the burden rests on the Defendants to prove this on a balance of probabilities. Of course, it is the Plaintiff’s case that there was no such oral variation.

## Defendants: Plaintiff did not enforce rights under original Distribution Agreement

24     In their Closing Submissions, to support their case that there was such Oral Variation, the Defendants highlighted that the Plaintiff’s not enforcing their right was evidence that there was an oral variation. The Defendants cited the instance such as when the Defendants were allowed to collect only 288 Products instead of 1,000 Products, and the Plaintiff not being “in any hurry”[^14] for the Defendants to collect the balance 712 Products.

25     Reviewing the Notes of Evidence, when this was posed to Mr Jensen Tay (PW1) he first explained that he was not aware until later:[^15]

>   
| 

\[DC\]

 | 

Subsequent to this written agreement---

 |
| 

\[PW1\]

 | 

Mmm hmm.

 |
| 

\[DC\]

 | 

you only allowed, you meaning **the company, only allowed him to take 288 instead of 1,000 bottles. Do you agree with that?** That’s what he instructs me.

 |
| 

\[PW1\]

 | 

On the day itself or subsequently?

 |
| 

\[DC\]

 | 

On the day when he went to collect.

 |
| 

\[PW1\]

 | 

**I didn’t even know after he left.** You know, **I thought that he has (****_sic_****) collected everything.**

 |
| 

(My emphases.)

 |

  
  

26     When he was asked whether he later checked with his staff, Mr Jensen Tay replied –[^16]

> Yah, I was absolutely shocked that why he just collected the---and why did the number---why was it 288. You know, was it meant to be a lucky number, a charm or what because it was understood that he has got it. And we had subsequently kept chasing him to take the rest of the bottles. But if on that day itself, no, I---I---I don’t know why was this 288 number collected.

27     However, Mr Jensen Tay was also confronted with his being aware that the Defendants were going to collect a quantity short of what was agreed, and he responded that he might have replied in a hurry:[^17]

>   
| 

\[DC\]

 | 

Now, looking still at that same page that I referred you to your WhatsApp message just now---

 |
| 

\[PW1\]

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[DC\]

 | 

at page---

 |
| 

 | 

128, Your Honour. Yes, 128, sorry. Your Honour, I’m looking at the top, on 5th of September ’18. Susanna Lim \[DW2\]--- the timestamp is 12:35:56. Alright.

 |
| 

 | 

This is to you---**Ms. Susanna Lim wrote to you---a text to you, “Jenson, tomorrow we will collect 3 carton (****_sic_****) of 48 per cart. Please give address.” You replied subsequently at 12:36.**

 |
| 

\[PW1\]

 | 

Mmm hmm.

 |
| 

\[DC\]

 | 

**“Okay, can. We will inform them about what time.” So, you see, Mr. Tay**, you had a---

 |
| 

\[PW1\]

 | 

Mmm hmm.

 |
| 

\[DC\]

 | 

**you knew beforehand---before the collection that they were only going to collect 3 cartons of 48, right? So---and you said, “Okay, can.”**

 |
| 

\[PW1\]

 | 

But did I further say, “Okay, can. You can collect 3 cartons of 48”? Because the thing is my---you know, could it be, you know, that at that time that I’m really busy I can only reply “Okay, can. Will you infirm (_sic_) but what time?” Things like that because the thing is I did not, you know---I did not agree to, you know, the 3 carton of 48 honestly. I---I have to be very frank on that, yah.

 |
| 

(My emphases.)

 |

  
  

28     So, if Mr Jensen Tay knew that the Defendants were going to collect short, admittedly, he had only ‘gently nudged’ the Defendants to move on the remainder of the Products. The Defendants submitted that this was because the Plaintiff was mindful of the variation to the Distribution Agreement. It was therefore evidence that there was that Oral Variation.

## The Court’s Findings

29     Pruned from the rest of the Notes of Evidence to stand alone, the above might seem to propagate that very proposition the Defendants are urging the Court to find. In fact, it does show Mr Jensen Tay to vacillate in his evidence. However, considering the other evidence that were before me, I received a different picture.

### References were made to the original terms of the Distribution Agreement.

30     On 12 October 2018 – which was still within the first 3 months of the signing of the Distribution Agreement – the Plaintiffs were already raising the issue to the Defendants of when they would collect the balance of the Products. Text message of even date from Mr Jensen Tay (PW1) to Mr Christopher Tan (DW1) reads:[^18]

> Hi bro, I’m having Beautelicious meeting right now and **they are asking me when you will be collecting the remaining bottles from the first order? As of now only 288 out of 1,000 had been collected. Just a remained (****_sic_****) that the 2**nd**order of 2,000 bottles is due in November**. Thanks.

(My emphases.)

31     So, there is the reference to the original term of the Distribution Agreement even within the first 3 months of the Distribution Agreement. Further, it cannot be ignored that in the same chain of exchanges, Mr Jensen Tay had also said[^19] –

> “**Yes, not chasing you but just following what was written in the agreement that the next stock collection is by November**. …”

32     The Defendants had twisted the Plaintiff’s apparent laxed and tolerant response towards them as the Plaintiff’s biding by the then varied terms of the Agreement. In Court, Mr Jensen Tay (PW1) had explained his response when he said,[^20]

> What can I do? Point a gun on (_sic_) his head and ask him to come down and pick it up?

> …

> Since we are going to be like so bro, bro and I’m supposed to--- can I just save him a bit of face if that was my intention?

33     The Plaintiff also made reference to showing the Defendant “charity and goodwill”[^21] and saving Mr Christopher Tan’s face, and “not trying to turn this whole thing ugly”[^22]. He continued: [^23]

> There’s still a partnership agreement going on. The least, you know, I could do is, I mean, just to … ---show some support to---to be positive and to show some… support in… this by wishing him good luck and things like that.

34     It did not escape the Court that, of course, by this point in time of the case being in progress, Mr Tay could testify anything in his favour and show the appropriate indignation and give pet answers. But if this Court had only those to go on, it would be a very weak case for the Plaintiff indeed, to try to persuade that there was no Oral Variation.

35     Before I go on to give my other reasons why I do not find that there is the Oral Variation of the Distribution Agreement, I would like to briefly address the Defendants’ other argument which suggests that the Plaintiff had abided by the varied terms of the Distribution Agreement and hence, only commenced this suit on 14 January 2019 when parties’ relationship completely soured.

36     Looking at the terms of the original Distribution Agreement, the fact of the case is that the Defendants collected the Products on 6 September 2018. Under the original terms as provided in Clause 5.2 of the Distribution Agreement, the Defendants had until 6 December 2018 or before they made their next batch of order, to make payment. It would therefore be reasonable to see why the Plaintiff had held back until after the due date for payment had come and gone, and the fact established that they were not receiving their due payment, before they made their move of suing the Defendants.

37     I, in fact, considered that the Plaintiff’s lodging their claim on 14 January 2019 when they only established on 6 December 2018 that they were not going to be paid, to be prompt. I was therefore unable to appreciate the Defendant’s submission on this fact.

38     There are other reasons why I was not persuaded by Defendant’s arguments that there was an Oral Variation of the Distribution Agreement. Some of these were raised by Plaintiff Counsel which tilted the Balance of Probabilities against the Defendants.

### The Oral Variation does not make commercial sense.

39     Whilst the Plaintiff and Defendants had a common friend in one Mr Samuel Seow, a lawyer, who recommended the Defendants to the Plaintiff, the fact of the case is that at the end of the day, they were business partners – or, more business partners – than friends. As the Plaintiff had confirmed, they had a Product but they needed someone to market the Product for them.[^24] Hence, Mr Samuel Seow connected the Defendants with the Plaintiff[^25] and even assisted to draft the Distribution Agreement between them.[^26] This was business.

40     In that business relationship, I would agree with Plaintiff Counsel when he submitted that the Oral Variation made no commercial sense as the effect of it would be that the Plaintiffs would be subjecting themselves to earn very much lesser than what they could otherwise have earned under the original Distribution Agreement.[^27]

41     It was established with Mr Christopher Tan (DW1) that under the original Distribution Agreement, the Plaintiff would earn S$60 x 6,500 Product, that is, S$390,000.[^28] However, under the terms of the Oral Variation, the Plaintiff would have earned but a fraction of that sum: S$21,400.[^29] Mr Tan agreed with these figures. When asked for his view on such an arrangement, even Mr Christopher Tan had candidly expressed that he would find this unacceptable:[^30]

>   
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

So, Mr Tan, what you are saying is that **as a result of the change in the agreement that the oral variation**, right---

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Mmm hmm.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**which was made around 8** th **of August 2018**\---

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

right? **The Plaintiff would have to receive a lot less money than what they had already originally agreed to under the distribution agreement. Yes?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Yes.**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Right? And this was made like I said earlier around the same time as the distribution agreement was entered into. Yes?

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Right. **So, Mr. Tan, really if you are in the position of the Plaintiff**\---

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

right, **would you agree to take a lot less money? Yes or no?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Of course, I will not.**

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**And so, Mr. Tan, really when we look at it from a commercial point of view it does not make sense to have the contract varied in the way that your (** **_sic_** **) claim it was. Do you agree or you disagree?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**I agree.**

 |

  
  

42     Given even Mr Christopher Tan’s position on this, surely the Defendants could not have seriously expected the Court to believe that the Plaintiff would agree to such an arrangement. If so, the finding must be that there was no such Oral Variation.

### The Oral Variation could have been incorporated into the Distribution Agreement if it were indeed made.

43     As shown from the Notes of Evidence produced earlier, it was admitted by Mr Christopher Tan that the alleged variations were entered into around the same time as the signing of the Distribution Agreement[^31]:

>   
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

… here on page 10 \[of your Amended Defence and counterclaim\] and it flows on to page 11, you set out what the alleged oral variation is. Yes?

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

And now, Mr. Tan, at tab 6 **the first 5 words “at around the same time”**, do you see those words, Mr. Tan?

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Okay. Yes.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

And, Mr. Tan, **the reference to “at around the same time” is a reference to 8**th**August 2018. Is that correct?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Right. **So, Mr. Tan, what your case is---is that the oral variation was entered into at around the same time that the distribution agreement was entered into between the parties. Is that correct?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Mmm, can you repeat your question?

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Alright. **So, what paragraph 6 which is your Defence**, right—

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**says is that the alleged oral variation was entered into at around the same time that the distribution agreement was entered into on 8th August 2018. Is that correct?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Correct.**

 |

  
  

(My emphases.)

44     If that was the case, there was no explanation why the variations were not or could not have been incorporated into the Distribution Agreement, even if it required an amendment to the Distribution Agreement. Any explanation for this would be interesting.

45     It seemed clumsy that a Distribution Agreement would be drafted whilst an Oral Variation was being discussed and allegedly agreed on, and then parties went ahead to sign on the Distribution Agreement while orally varying it? Plaintiff Counsel highlighted this point and considered it “bizarre and divorced from reality” and “makes no sense whatsoever”.[^32]

### Parties had made no reference to the Oral Variation; not even the Defendants when they could have wielded it to protect their position.

46     In the WhatsApp exchanges between the Plaintiff and the Defendants, the alleged Oral Variation was also never referred to, and this was affirmed and confirmed by Mr Christopher Tan when he was cross-examined:[^33]

>   
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**So, Mr. Tan, if, right, the change in the terms of the agreement had happened---**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**as you said it did, right, when Mr. Tay wrote that message to say you are not complying with the agreement you would have or you---it would have been fair for you to respond to say, “We have agreed to something else, we have changed the terms of the agreement.”**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**Correct?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**And so, Mr. Tan, really when we look at this exchange, you had the opportunity to tell Mr. Tay that, “we changed the terms of the agreement”, yes?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Yup.**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**But you didn’t. Correct?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Yes.**

 |
| 

**…**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

And again on PBD 51 we see Mr. Tay saying at 4:12:52pm on PBD51, we’re still at the top of page, Mr. Tan, 4:12:52pm,---

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Okay.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**Mr. Tay’s response, “Yes, not chasing you, but just following what was written in the agreement** that the next start collection is by November.” Do you see that?

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Right. **And so again here Mr. Tay is insisting that you comply with the terms of the agreement. Correct?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Right. And here is your response at 12---12th of October 2018 4:17:10pm, right? “Bro, we are trying out (_sic_) best, I also hope we can sell. All my cash stuck into this business.”

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Mmm.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Do you recall that?

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**And again, Mr. Tan, there is no response---no mention of the alleged change in the terms of the agreement. Correct?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Correct.**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**Right? And here you have another opportunity to remind the---the---the Plaintiff that the terms of the agreement were changed. Do you agree or you disagree?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Agree.**

 |

  
  

(My emphases.)

47     Clearly then, even at the crucial points when the Defendants were ‘hounded’ to comply with the express terms of the Distribution Agreement, and had the opportunity to wield the Oral Variation as a shield to defend their stance, the Defendants did not. Earlier,[^34] I had also highlighted the Plaintiff’s making reference to only the terms of the original Distribution Agreement. This must be because there was no Oral Variation.

### Existence of an Oral Variation was not raised before the Defence was filed.

48     It was also not challenged or disputed by the Defendants that the first time that the alleged Oral Variation was raised was when the original Defence and counterclaim was filed on 4 February 2019.

49     Flowing from the above, it is this Court’s finding of fact that there was no such Oral Variation as was alleged to have been agreed between the parties. If the above findings were not enough, there was also Mr Christopher Tan’s own admission to there being no Oral Variation:[^35]

\[DC\]

 | 

Okay. **Had not taken place, you agreed with him.**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Correct.**

 |

  
  

(My emphases.)

But there was no need to even rely on this to arrive at my finding.

50     Fully persuaded that there was no Oral Variation to the Distribution Agreement, the natural fallback is that the original terms of the Distribution Agreement must prevail. It is therefore relevant to determine if the Defendants had breached the terms of the original Distribution Agreement.

## ISSUE 2: WHETHER THE DEFENDANTS HAD BREACHED THE TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

51     A breach of contract occurs when one party to an agreement fails or refuses to perform a contractual obligation. Little need to be discussed on this issue for the present case as Mr Christopher Tan, in his cross-examination, had conceded unequivocally, that the First Defendant had breached the following express terms of the Distribution Agreement:[^36]

> (a)     Clause 4.3 – in that the First Defendant had not placed orders for the Products in the stipulated 3 batches;

> (b)     Clause 5.2 – in that the First Defendant had not paid the balance S$40 per Product of the 1,000 Products plus GST, which amounted to S$42,800.

52     I re-produce a portion of the relevant Notes of Evidence:[^37]

>   
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

**do you agree then that Luxperial did not comply (** **_sic_** **) clause 4.3?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Agree.**

 |
| 

\[PC\]

 | 

Thank you. **And Luxperial also has not paid the remaining 42,800, right? The $40 per product under clause 5.2. Yes?**

 |
| 

\[DW1\]

 | 

**Yes. Agree.**

 |

  
  

(My emphases.)

53     Despite the above findings, it is the Defendants’ case that there was a misrepresentation to, _inter alia_, the origin of the Products prior to the execution of the Distribution Agreement which was material enough to rescind the Distribution Agreement. The Defendants therefore counterclaimed for the amount of S$21,400 which they had, under the misrepresentation, paid to the Plaintiff for the 288 Products.

## ISSUE 3: WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT SHOULD BE RESCINDED FOR MISREPRESENTATION.

54     In his Defence, the Defendants raised the argument of the misrepresentations that the Plaintiff made, which representations the Defendants relied on and so, entered into the Distribution Agreement with the Plaintiff on 8 August 2018.[^38] Quite clearly, the Defendants alleged fraudulent misrepresentation. I repeat the alleged misrepresentations here for easy reference:

> (A)     “that the Products were Products of Singapore”;

> (B)     “that the Products could be exported and distributed without issue in Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Taiwan and the USA and would sell well”;

> (C)     “that the shelf life of the Products would be in excess of two (2) years”; and

> (D)     “that the Products that would be sold to the First Defendant would be identical to the sample bottles the Defendants received”.

55     To succeed in pleading this, the onus is on the Defendants to prove that –

> (a)     there \[was\] a misrepresentation of fact by words or conduct;

> (b)     the representation \[was\] made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the \[Defendants in this case\]…;

> (c)     the \[Defendants in this case\] had acted upon the false statement;

> (d)     the \[Defendants\] suffered by so doing; and

> (e)     the representation \[was\] made with knowledge that it \[was\] false; it \[was\] wilfully false, or at least made in the absence of of any genuine belief that it \[was\] true.

> See: _Panatron Pte Ltd & Anor_ v _Lee Cheow Lee & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 435</span> at \[14\].[^39]

56     I note that in his Closing Submissions, Defence Counsel had focused on the first of the alleged misrepresentations: that the Products were made in Singapore when they were made in China.

## Alleged Misrepresentation (A): “The Products were Products of Singapore.”

57     The Defendants argued that in one of their early meetings, the Plaintiff had shown the Product to the Defendants which packaging of the Product bore the label “Product of Singapore”. This was affirmed by Mr Jensen Tay (PW1).[^40]

58     I agree with Defence Counsel when he submitted that “\[g\]iven that if all these was provided to Christopher at the onset, it is submitted that Christopher and indeed, any reasonable person would have been under the impression or had in their mind that the Product was made, and/or manufactured in Singapore”.[^41] It was therefore the Defendants’ case that the Plaintiff “had sought to keep \[this information of the provenance of the Product\] hidden from the \[First\] and \[Second\] Defendants.”[^42]

59     Defence Counsel then also referred to the incident where the Defendants asked Mr Jensen Tay about printing a label that would read “Formulated in Paris”. Defence Counsel suggested that if the Defendants knew the provenance of the Product – that it was from China – they would not be “under the impression the Product was made in France”.[^43] I am unable to agree with Defence Counsel’s suggestion and submission on this interpretation of events.

60     There was nothing in evidence that suggested to me that the Defendants had any reason at all to think that the Product was from France. (It was only in response to this suggestion of the Defendants’ that the Plaintiff informed Mr Christopher Tan that the only link to France was the active ingredient in the Product that came from the French laboratory.) Instead, I would think that it would be a more reasonable reaction if the Defendants, not knowing the provenance of the Product, asked where it was from rather than suggest how to label it. I, in fact, think that _because_ they suggested that the label read “Formulated in Paris”, that they _would_ know, or have an idea of, the provenance of the Product.

61     We are therefore back to the question of whether the Plaintiff had misrepresented the provenance of the Product to the Defendants, that it was a Singapore product and not a China product.

62     I took a step back and considered the evidence as a whole.

63     It is the evidence of the case that the Plaintiff _did_ provide the Product sample to the Defendants which read “Made in Singapore”.[^44] This was a sticker pasted on the packaging. Subsequently after the Defendants entered into the Distribution Agreement with the Plaintiff, the Product provided to the Defendants for distribution had, printed on its packaging, “Manufactured in China”. The evidence also is that the Plaintiff was the one who came up with the idea of having the sticker pasted over the print which read “Manufactured in China”.[^45]

64     It was the Defendant’s evidence that the Defendants claimed to have discovered only through the MSDS the provenance of the Product. This was on or about 5 October 2018 (although the evidence also was that the MSDS was made available to the Defendants from about 18 September 2018 _via_ email). There was also evidence that the Defendants had attempted to distribute the Products to Thailand and in submitting the MSDS to FDA Thailand, that they were alerted to this fact.[^46]

65     Contrarily, it was the Plaintiff’s evidence that the Defendants knew from the outset that the Products were from China. It was also suggested by the Plaintiff that when the Product sample was shown to the Defendants, the label sticker was on the packaging. In oral testimony, the Plaintiff also suggested that the sticker could be easily peeled off “within 10 seconds”.[^47] Further, at a point in time, the Defendants themselves also inquired if they could have their own sticker pasted over it.[^48]

66     Considering the evidence as a whole on this issue, at first blush, I would agree with Defence Counsel that it would be reasonable for anyone looking at a product packaging which reads “Made in Singapore” to think that the provenance of the Product is Singapore. However, the fact of the case is that the Defendant was subsequently provided with the Product, and the evidence before me was that that Product packaging came with printed words “Manufactured in China” and no sticker. So on 6 September 2018 when the Defendants collected the Products, “Manufactured in China” on 288 Products would be ‘in their face’ so to speak.

67     The evidence of the case, however, is that the Defendants raised no hue and cry about this. In fact, under Clause 6.2 of the Distribution Agreement, it is provided that the Defendants would have an opportunity to “examine such Product and satisfy itself that it meets its requirements” and to raise a claim for “defective Product… in writing… within 7 days”.[^49] This did not happen.

68     I would also consider it reasonable that someone who invests in and receives a product with a view to distributing it, upon seeing a sticker on the packaging would enquire there and then the reason for the sticker. As Mr Jensen Tay said, the sticker “can be taken off within 10 Seconds”.[^50] I would also think that if Mr Jensen Tay had in mind to make any misrepresentations to the Defendants that Singapore was the provenance of the Product, the sticker would be too much of a giveaway. A more sophisticated method such as having a packaging which clearly and boldly reads, “Made in Singapore” is more likely to succeed and to avert questions.

69     Further, that the Defendants themselves also requested to have their own stickers pasted on the packaging[^51] demonstrated to me that they were well aware of the information on the packaging and the need to have that information overwritten or covered up.

70     Further, the evidence also bears out that despite the Defendants discovering from the MSDS that the Products were made in China on 5 October 2018 – even if I were to go along with the Defendants on this – there was nothing on this raised to the Plaintiffs. Oddly, on 2 November 2018, the Defendants were even prepared to pay for the packaging to be changed into smaller volumes.[^52]

71     All evidence taken into consideration, I am unable to find that the Plaintiff had misrepresented the provenance of the Product to the Defendants.

## Alleged Misrepresentation (B): “That the Products could be exported and distributed without issue in Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Taiwan and the USA and would sell well.”

72     Under the Distribution Agreement, the preamble provides that the OWNER (Plaintiff) “has determined… to enhance the development of the market and increase the sales of its Products in the Territory…”[^53] The countries specifically listed in “Territory” are “Singapore; Malaysia; Vietnam; The People’s Republic of China (excluding Taiwan; Macau; and Hong Kong); Taiwan; and United States of America”.[^54]

73     There was no evidence before me of any representation by the Plaintiff to the Defendants that the Products could be “exported and distributed without issue in Indonesia, … Thailand, Cambodia, \[and\] Philippines… and would sell well.” There is a lacuna in information of, for example, when this representation was made, to whom of the Defendants, and under what circumstance. These are missing. How then could the Court be expected to believe that there was this representation?

74     Regarding this alleged misrepresentation, I further accept Plaintiff Counsel’s submission and the case authority of _Broadley Construction Pte Ltd_ v _Alacran Design Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 110</span> at \[36 – 38\]. This case adopts the position in _Peekay Intermark Ltd_ v _Australia and NZ Banking Group Ltd_ \[2006\] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 511 that “where the true position appears clearly from the terms of the very contract which the \[Defendant in this case\] says it was induced to enter into by the misrepresentation… the person is bound by the contract that he signs… Such a \[party\] should be taken to have actually read the contract and known the falsity of the earlier representation”.

75     For the avoidance of doubt, I should state that following from my finding on the Alleged Misrepresentation (A), the Defendants have not successfully proven on a balance of probabilities any ‘falsity of \[ \] earlier representation”. There is therefore no earlier falsity that should be cured by the Defendants reading the terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement.

76     Nevertheless, applying the case authority of _Broadley Construction_ to the Alleged Misrepresentation (B), _even if_ there was a representation by the Plaintiff that the Products “could be exported and distributed without issue” to all of the named countries as alleged, it could not be said that the Defendants were so induced. This is because the Defendants would have had the benefit of the Distribution Agreement which they would rightly be taken to have read then signed. They would therefore have known the “true position” without having to rely on any false claims. At the minimum, they could raise questions of why the other countries were not also listed in the “Territory” if the same ease of shipment could also apply to these other countries.

77     All in, the Defendants had not proven on a balance of probabilities that the Plaintiffs had made any representation that the Products could be shipped with ease to a country not listed under “Territory” in the Distribution Agreement, let alone that it was a misrepresentation.

## Alleged Misrepresentation (C): “That the shelf life of the Products would be in excess of two (2) years.”

78     On this allegation, I accept Plaintiff Counsel’s submission that as at 6 June 2018 when the Defendants enquired of the Plaintiff on their “old stock”, the Plaintiff had informed that the expiry date of the stock was “2 years plus”[^55]. That was rightly so at that point in time. 3 months later, by 6 September 2018 when the Defendants collected the stock, time would have elapsed and it could be reasonably expected that some of the Products would no longer be “in excess of two (2) years”. Mr Christopher Tan also ultimately conceded this when he was on the witness stand.[^56]

## Alleged Misrepresentation (D): “That the Products that would be sold to the First Defendant would be identical to the sample bottles the Defendants received”.

79     On this allegation, we had alluded to this earlier when discussing on the provenance of the Product, as well as the evidence that the Defendants had requested that the Plaintiffs do not stick their labels onto the packaging since the Defendants had in mind to use their own printed stickers to stick on the packaging.[^57]

80     It flows from the above that the First Defendant had failed to prove their Defence and the Defendants their counterclaim on a balance of probabilities. The Plaintiff, on the other hand, had succeeded in proving, on a balance of probabilities, that the Defendants had breached the terms of the Distribution Agreement.

81     As the First Defendants had breached the terms of the Distribution Agreement, by Clause 15 of the Distribution Agreement, the Second Defendant stands in as guarantor of the fulfilment of the obligations under the Distribution Agreement and is accordingly also liable to the Plaintiff.

## ORDER

82     It is therefore my order that the First Defendant and Second Defendant be jointly and severally liable to the Plaintiff:

> (a)     For the sum of S$42,800, being the balance of the amounts due under the Distribution Agreement for the first batch of the Products, _i.e._, S$40 x 1,000 x 7% GST;

> (b)     For interest from the date of breach to the date of the judgment at 6% pursuant to Clause 5.3 of the Distribution Agreement; and

> (c)     Costs.

83     I shall hear parties on your submissions for costs.
