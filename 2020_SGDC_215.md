### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Mr Li Chaoyun (“**Li**”, also known as “Kenny”) was employed by the Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (“**JSPL**”) as an engineer. Li was a section manager in the engineering department of JSPL. While so employed by JSPL, he set up a company known as NewAir Engineering Group Pte Ltd (“**NewAir**”). NewAir was set up as a joint venture with Ms Tam Yit Ngor (“**Tam**”, also known as “Brenda”). Under their joint venture arrangement, Tam provided capital to start the company, while Li contributed his technical expertise as an engineer.

2       NewAir was incorporated in March 2011. Although Li was the founder and a major shareholder of NewAir, his name did not appear in the company’s incorporation papers or accounting records. The first directors of NewAir were Tam and a person known as Liu Li (“**LL**”). LL was then Li’s wife and acted as his proxy. LL’s position as director was subsequently replaced by one Li Dinglong (“**LDL**”). LDL was Li’s nephew and likewise acted as Li’s proxy in NewAir.

3       Between 2011 and 2014, NewAir successfully quoted for contracts with JSPL. After NewAir successfully secured its first contract with JSPL (for a project known as “**Project 1101**”), 51% of NewAir’s shares were transferred to Li (held under the name of his proxy, LDL). Subsequently, various other sums of money were given to Li in cash, as well as cheques in the names of LL and LDL.

4       Li and Tam were subsequently investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“**CPIB**”). Following the investigations, Li was charged with 34 counts of corruptly _accepting_ gratification, under s 6(a) of the _Prevention of Corruption Act_ (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“**PCA**”); Tam was charged with 34 mirror charges under s 6(b) of the PCA for _giving_ the gratification to Li.

5       At the conclusion of the trial, both defendants were found guilty and convicted on all the charges. On 13 February 2020, Li was sentenced to a total of 34 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay a penalty of $956,600; Tam was sentenced to a total of 30 months’ imprisonment. Both defendants filed the present appeals against their conviction and sentence on the same day. The prosecution, which had sought a higher sentence for each defendant, filed an appeal against the sentences on 18 February 2020. The execution of the sentences has been stayed, and both defendants are on bail pending the appeal.

6       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## Trial

### Charges

7       The 34 charges against each defendant were similarly worded, with different particulars relating to the date of the offence and the amount of gratification. The charges faced by Li for accepting gratification were mirrored in the charges faced by Tam for giving the gratification.

8       The charges against Li were worded as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on or about _\[date\]_, in Singapore, being an agent, to wit, a Section Manager in the employ of Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (“JSPL”), did corruptly accept from one Tam Yit Ngor, a Director of NewAir Engineering Group Pte Ltd (“NewAir”), _\[gratification\]_, as a _\[reward or inducement\]_ for doing an act in relation to your principal’s affairs, to wit, advancing NewAir’s business interests with JSPL and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

9       The charges against Tam were worded as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on or about _\[date\]_, in Singapore, being an agent, to wit, Director of NewAir Engineering Group Pte Ltd (“NewAir”), did corruptly give one Li Chaoyun, a Section Manager of Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd (“JSPL”), _\[gratification\]_, as a _\[reward or inducement\]_ for doing an act in relation to JSPL’s affairs, to wit, advancing NewAir’s business interest with JSPL and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

10     The particulars of each charge were as follows:

### Prosecution’s case

#### While Li was employed by JSPL, Li and Tam set up NewAir

12     JSPL (a subsidiary of Sembcorp Marine Ltd) was in the business of providing ship building, ship repair, rig building and offshore engineering services to a worldwide clientele. JSPL had an engineering department, within which was a section that dealt with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Condition (“**HVAC**”). At the material time, Li was the manager of the HVAC section.

13     NewAir was incorporated on 11 March 2011, while Li was still under the employ of JSPL. The directors of NewAir were Tam and LL (Li’s wife then). On 16 January 2012, LL was replaced by LDL (Li’s nephew) as director of NewAir. Both LL and LDL were Li’s proxies in NewAir.

#### Li assisted NewAir to obtain business from JSPL

##### (1)   Li recommended that NewAir be invited to quote

14     It was the prosecution’s case that Li, as the manager of the HVAC section of JSPL’s engineering department, was able to influence JSPL’s procurement of HVAC-related products and services at various stages of the procurement process, and to assist NewAir to secure JSPL business.

15     Evidence was led from various officers from JSPL’s engineering and procurement departments, including the following:

> (a)     Koay Chin Hock Adam, head of JSPL’s procurement department (PW4, “**Koay (procurement)**”);

> (b)     Seow Tan Hong, senior general manager of JSPL’s engineering department, who was Li’s superior (PW9, “**Seow (engineering)**”);

> (c)     Ang Ee Beng, deputy general manager of JSPL’s engineering department, who was Li’s direct superior (PW10, “**Ang (engineering)**”);

> (d)     Lok Khoi Mun, a procurement officer (PW11, “**Lok (PO)**”).

16     Their testimony was that the technical specifications (“**TS**”) of JSPL’s HVAC products was approved by Li. The TS was then passed to the procurement department to obtain quotes from vendors. Li was able to recommend to the procurement department the vendors to invite to quote. For NewAir’s first project with JSPL (Project 1101), Li sent an email to the procurement department to recommend that NewAir be one of the vendors invited to quote.[^1] Based on Li’s recommendation, the procurement department invited NewAir to quote for the project. This was done although NewAir was a new company with no prior business, no “proven track record in marine offshore industries” or a “sound financial track record”.[^2]

##### (2)   Li drafted NewAir’s technical proposal (TP) for submission to JSPL

17     Li assisted NewAir by drafting the technical proposal (“**TP**”) for its first project (Project 1101) for submission to JSPL. Li admitted to this in a written statement that he gave to the CPIB:

> Q6)    Before the awarding of contract to M/s Newair from M/s JSPL, what did you do to help M/s Newair \[…\] in order for M/s Newair to get the M/s JSPL contract?

> A6)    I only helped to prepare the very first Technical Proposal that M/s Newair submit to M/s JSPL. \[…\][^3]

18     Tam made a similar admission in her written statement to the CPIB:

> \[…\] Li Chao Yun assisted M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd to break into the M/s JSPL market by assisting to do up the technical proposal for the Tucana project \[the first project from M/s JSPL\].[^4]

19     (Five written statements given by Li in the course of investigations by the CPIB[^5] were admitted in evidence after an ancillary hearing. The ancillary hearing is discussed later at \[66\]-\[70\].)

##### (3)   Li oversaw the technical bid evaluation (TBE) of TPs submitted

20     After vendors submitted their TPs, the engineers in the HVAC section would evaluate the TPs and prepare the technical bid evaluation (“**TBE**”). Li had oversight over his engineers who prepared the TBEs, and it was within Li’s scope of work to review and approve the TBEs. TBEs would contain, among other things, recommendations to the procurement department on which vendor’s TP was more technically compliant with JSPL’s project requirements and thus ought to be selected for the job. Where Li disagreed with any recommendation made by his engineers, he could amend the recommendation.[^6]

##### (4)   Li had influence over the commercial bid evaluation (CBE)

21     Lok (PO) testified that, at the material time, he was a new and inexperienced procurement officer. He habitually discussed with Li about which vendors were technically superior and were more competitive in pricing. He took Li’s views into account when preparing the commercial bid evaluation (“**CBE**”). (The CBE was a document prepared by the procurement department and used in the course of evaluating and deciding which vendor(s) to award jobs to.) His discussions with Li included jobs that NewAir was bidding for; he was _not aware_ that Li was involved in NewAir.[^7]

22     For Project 1101, Lok (PO) testified that he recorded down Li’s recommendation on a draft CBE. This was a document that he used when discussing with Li on which vendors to recommend to award for that project. Li recommended that NewAir be awarded three out of the four items listed for the project. This recommendation was recorded in a handwritten line which stated: “_Kenny’s proposal: All package to NewAir except silencer package to AirTrade_”.[^8]

##### (5)   Li had influence over the proposal to owner (PTO)

23     After completing the CBE, JSPL would propose to the shipowner the vendor(s) to award jobs to. This would take the form of a proposal to owner (“**PTO**”). The owner would then decide whether to award the jobs to the proposed vendors. Li would be involved in meetings between the owners and JSPL’s engineers to discuss the choice of vendors, and he was in a position to communicate with the owners and provide his views on the vendors.[^9] Li was thus able to recommend NewAir to the owners and to influence them to engage NewAir for jobs.

##### (6)   Li had access to confidential information to assist in NewAir’s price quotations

24     The prosecution led evidence to show that Li was in possession of price-sensitive information which he obtained, illicitly, from Lok (PO). Lok (PO) testified that he sent confidential CBEs to Li on Li’s request. The CBEs contained confidential information on prices quoted by vendors and commercial proposals pertaining to JSPL projects. The CBEs were sent to Li _before_ JSPL awarded contracts for those projects. It was a breach of JSPL’s policies for such commercial information from the procurement department to be disclosed to Li, who was in the engineering department. Lok (PO) admitted that he had shared such information with Li even though he was not allowed to.[^10] A sample of four CBEs was tendered in evidence.[^11] These had been extracted from the hard disk of a laptop belonging to Li and seized from his home.

25     In Li’s statement to the CPIB, he “could not explain” why, as an engineer, he had possession of commercial proposals of vendors and CBEs in his laptop. He admitted that he was not supposed to have those documents in his possession.[^12]

26     Various emails between Li and Tam in the period February 2012 to July 2013 were tendered in evidence. In these emails, they discussed matters such as the prices to quote, discounts to be given, mark up, possible gross profits, and so forth. Li gave his opinion and advice to Tam on these matters. [^13]

#### NewAir made substantial profits for which Li received gratification

27     NewAir’s contracts with JSPL reaped substantial profits. Between 2012 and 2014, Tam drew money from NewAir for herself while making payments to Li directly or through his proxies. It was not in dispute that a number of transactions occurred (as summarised at \[28\[-\[31\] below).[^14]

28     On or about 16 January 2012, Tam transferred 51% of NewAir’s shares (amounting to approximately $255,000) to Li’s nephew, LDL (1st charge). This transfer of shares took place after NewAir was awarded its first contract (for Project 1101) at the end of 2011.

29     On various occasions between January and June 2012, various cheques were issued by NewAir in favour of Li’s wife, LL. Tam passed the cheques to Li. Li deposited the cheques into LL’s bank accounts. The salient details of these cheque payments are set out in the following table:

#### Li acted in conflict of interest

32     It was the prosecution’s case that Li acted in conflict of interest. JSPL had a Conflict of Interest Policy which provided the following:

> Avoidance of Preferential Treatment

> Employees shall not grant preferential treatment in relation to any person, organization, family member or friend who may benefit from the business transaction. Employees must avoid being obligated or seemingly obligated to any person/organization that might profit from this special contribution. \[…\][^15]

33     Choong Shee Sai Kevin, Vice President of Human Resource at JSPL (PW13, “**Choong (HR)**”) testified that it was wrong for Li to have recommended NewAir as a vendor without declaring his interest or involvement in NewAir. Had Li made a declaration, JSPL would have been put on alert and the procurement department could have been more stringent in assessing NewAir’s bid as a vendor.[^16] As an employee of JSPL, Li was not allowed to do any work for NewAir without informing JSPL, as that would be a conflict of interest.[^17]

34     In Li’s statement to the CPIB, he admitted that he was not allowed under the Code of Conduct of JSPL to have an interest in a company that was having business transactions with JSPL.[^18] Li only made a declaration of his interest in NewAir in October 2014[^19], after the CPIB had begun (in September 2014) to investigate into his dealings involving NewAir.

#### Tam sought Li’s help despite knowing that Li was acting in conflict of interest

35     It was the prosecution’s case that Tam had full knowledge that Li was working in JSPL and that he was acting in conflict of interest. In Tam’s statement to the CPIB, she admitted knowing that Li was working in JSPL. She said that it was Li who suggested doing business with JSPL because, as a JSPL employee, he could help NewAir break into the JSPL market more easily.

> \[…\] Li Chao Yun then suggested that M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd do businesses in Singapore instead. Li Chao Yun told me that he is in M/s JSPL and hence, M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd can first start doing business with M/s JSPL since he is working there and he could help to break into the M/s JSPL market easier. I agreed \[…\] [^20]

36     Tam knew that it was a conflict of interest for Li to be a director at Newair and do business with JSPL:

> Q3)    Why must Li Chao Yun put Li Ding Long or Liu Li’s name as a director of M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd?

> A3)    I wish to say that we did not want M/s JSPL to know that Li Chao Yun is involved in M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd as this would be a conflict of interest and M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd may not be able to do business with M/s JSPL.[^21]

> \[…\]

> A16)  \[…\] I knew it was wrong to set up M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd with Li Chao Yun as another director and yet do business with M/s JSPL as there would be a conflict of interest. M/s JSPL may not want to do business with M/s Newair Engineering \[Group\] Pte Ltd if they knew Li Chao Yun is a director of M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd and both Li Chao Yun and I had used names of Liu Li and Li Ding Long to hide this fact.[^22]

37     Nonetheless, Tam entered into the arrangement with Li because she relied on Li to help her “break into” the JSPL market:

> Q17)  Why still engage Li Chao Yun as a director of M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd when you already knew that there was a conflict of interest?

> A17)  I wish to say that I still engage Li Chao Yun as a director of M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd because he is the only M/s JSPL person I knew that time and he was the only person whom I know can help me break into the M/s JSPL market. If I wanted business from M/s JSPL, then I would need Li Chao Yun to assist me.[^23]

38     Tam knew that Li, as a JSPL employee, could help to recommend NewAir's products to JSPL:

> Q4)    \[…\] what do you mean by break into the M/s JSPL market?

> A4)    I wish to say that M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd's \[products\] is fairly new and being from China, is less likely to be accepted by \[local\] companies. _Hence, we need the help of Li Chao Yun to introduce our products so as to be able to sell them to M/s JSPL_.

> Q5)    \[…\] how did Li Chao Yun assist M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd to break into the M/s JSPL market?

> A5)    I wish to say that according to my understanding, _Li Chao Yun would help to introduce M/s Newair Engineering Group Pte Ltd's products to M/s JSPL procurement team so that they may consider and invite us to bid for M/s JSPL projects_. \[...\][^24]

> \[emphasis added\]

#### Steps were taken to conceal Li’s involvement in NewAir

39     Steps were taken by Li and Tam to conceal from JSPL the fact of Li’s involvement in NewAir.

##### (1)   The names of Li’s wife (LL) and nephew (LDL) were used as fronts

40     Li admitted in his statement to the CPIB that his wife LL, and subsequently his nephew LDL, were registered as directors of NewAir as a front to prevent JSPL from finding out that Li had an interest in NewAir:

> 46    Initially when we started the company, I used my wife’s name as one of the Directors of M/s NewAir Engineering Group Pte Ltd. \[…\] I did not want to be one of the named Director of the company as there would be conflict of interest, since I am going to start up a company while working in M/S JSPL. So I asked my wife if she was agreeable to be one of the named Director of the company and she agreed.

> \[…\]

> 50    In order to break into M/S JSPL, I would first have to remove my wife from the Director list as M/S JSPL might do a check and my wife name would appear, then M/S JSPL would know that I have an interest in M/s NewAir. Sometime around Jan 2012, I called my nephew, who is my 2nd brother’s son, Li Ding Long, to come Singapore to take over my wife, Liu Li as Director of M/s NewAir and he agreed. I wish to state that Li Dinglong did not receive any form of benefits by taking over my wife as the Director of M/s NewAir. \[…\]

> 51    Although Li Ding Long’s name was registered as one of the Directors of M/s NewAir, he was not involved, directly or indirectly, with the business operations of M/s NewAir, be it locally or overseas. The main operations of M/s NewAir was run by myself, as the technical adviser, and Brenda Tam, who handled the day-to-day operations. [^25]

41     In Tam’s statement to the CPIB, she admitted that she knew it was a conflict of interest for Li to be a director at NewAir and do business with JSPL, and both she and Li used the names of LL and LDL to hide this fact (see above, at \[36\].

##### (2)   Li used an alter-ego (“Forbes”) at NewAir

42     Evidence was led by the prosecution that Li created a false identity (“Forbes”). Li used this as an alter-ego at NewAir in order to hide his true identity from NewAir’s employees. In Tam’s testimony, she said that she asked Li to write a profile on “Forbes”, and the name “Forbes” was used so that nobody would know that Li was working in NewAir.[^26] For example, Li sent an e-mail as “Forbes” to himself as “Kenny Li” of JSPL.[^27] Conversely, Li also sent an email from his JSPL e-mail account to Tam and “Forbes” (which was himself):

> Dear Brenda/Forbes,

> I am very disappointed on the following email feedback.

> I forward this email to you for your deep thinking on your management \[…\] The Owner’s email is quite clearly identified your company problem for you. It affects your impression.

> It is very serious image to me. For the details, pls check with Steve Lee to get really improvement. I would like to see the previous Newair come back.

> Kenny Li

> Senior Manager

> Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd[^28]

#### Li and Tam lied to the CPIB

43     It was the prosecution’s case that both Li and Tam lied in their statements to the CPIB, which showed that they had guilty knowledge.

44     When Li was first questioned by the CPIB (on 24 September 2014), he denied setting up NewAir with Tam, being involved in NewAir’s business or knowing who LDL was.

> (a)     Li initially said that NewAir was set up by Tam _and LL_.[^29] In a subsequent statement (on 25 September 2014), he admitted that NewAir was set up _by him_ and Tam together while he was working in JSPL, and he did so knowing it was a conflict of interest.[^30]

> (b)     When Li was initially shown various documents involving NewAir, he said that he did not know to whom these documents belonged.[^31] He subsequently admitted that the documents belonged to him.[^32]

> (c)     Li initially said he found out that NewAir was supplying parts to JSPL after his wife left NewAir, and he asked the procurement department why they had chosen NewAir as a vendor.[^33] He subsequently admitted he was the one who wanted to use NewAir to “break into” JSPL’s market.[^34]

> (d)     Li initially said that he did not know who LDL was.[^35] He subsequently admitted that LDL was his nephew and that he had asked LDL to take over from LL as a registered director of NewAir.[^36]

> (e)     Li admitted that his initial statement had not been accurate and truthful, and that he lied because, among other things, he was afraid that he “would get into trouble with the authority that will end up in prison or fine.”[^37]

45     When Tam was first questioned by the CPIB (on 24 September 2014), she denied setting up NewAir with Li or knowing Li’s position in JSPL, or that LDL was Li’s proxy (claiming instead that LDL did work for NewAir).

> (a)     Tam initially said that she needed the name of a Singaporean to set up the company, and Li gave her LL’s name. [^38] In a subsequent statement (on 25 September 2014), she admitted that she had lied, and that in fact it was a decision by Li and her to set up NewAir, and Li told her to use the name of LL as he was working in JSPL and he did not want JSPL to find out about his involvement in NewAir. [^39]

> (b)     Tam initially said that she did not know Li was a section manager of JSPL, until she met him in JSPL after NewAir’s first job with JSPL.[^40] She subsequently admitted that she knew Li was JSPL’s section manager since (the time) they started NewAir.[^41]

> (c)     Tam initially said that it was her husband who told her to put LDL’s name as the director of NewAir.[^42] She subsequently admitted that it was Li who told her to put LDL as a director of NewAir as he could not register himself as a director of NewAir.[^43]

> (d)     Tam initially said that LDL did work for NewAir (to justify the cheque payments to LDL).[^44] She subsequently admitted that her initial statement that LDL did work for NewAir was untrue, and that LDL was “just a name” to hide the fact that Li was actually a director of NewAir and Li was receiving a salary from NewAir.[^45]

> (e)     Tam admitted that she had lied as she was afraid of getting into trouble if she had admitted to the truth.[^46]

### Defence

46     At the close of the prosecution’s case, both Li and Tam were called upon to enter their defence. They elected to testify.

#### Li’s defence

47     In his defence[^47], Li asserted that he had acted in JSPL’s best interests at all times. His intention was to use NewAir to benefit JSPL. He intended to use his years of knowledge and experience to add value to NewAir’s products delivered to JSPL, to advance JSPL’s interest in terms of costs savings and meeting JSPL’s technical requirements. NewAir’s prices were substantially cheaper than European brands. By engaging NewAir as its vendor, JSPL had substantial cost savings while it improved its technology. There was no loss or detriment to JSPL.[^48]

48     He and Tam were partners in NewAir. He was mainly in charge of the technical aspects of the business, while Tam provided the financial capital and oversaw the commercial aspects of the business. It was an equal partnership, reflected in the equal number of shares they each held. The shares allocated to Li and the payments to him were earned by him, in consideration of his technical expertise and contributions to NewAir. They were not bribes from Tam to Li to advance NewAir’s interests vis-à-vis JSPL.

49     The cheques issued in the names of LL and LDL were payments meant for them, not for him.[^49] LL was a director of NewAir and she received a monthly payment for doing some photocopying and printing.[^50] Subsequently, to develop NewAir’s business and operations in China, Li replaced LL with LDL as a director of NewAir. Li’s purpose in doing so was to tap on LDL’s Chinese citizenship to build trust with NewAir’s suppliers in China and obtain better commercial terms and conditions with the China suppliers, among other things. In consideration for LDL’s contribution to NewAir, he was given 51% shares in NewAir and a monthly sum of money.

50     Li was not involved in JSPL’s procurement process, which was very robust. There was no way he could have influenced it. He was unable to influence JSPL’s procurement of HVAC products and the engagement of NewAir as its vendor of HVAC products. NewAir was selected by JSPL because of its extremely competitive prices, and because it was able to meet JSPL’s technical specification requirements.[^51] NewAir secured more than $34 million worth of orders from JSPL.[^52] JSPL continued to order HVAC products from NewAir even after CPIB investigations commenced in September 2014, and even after Li had left JSPL in October 2014. (The last order from NewAir was in December 2015.)[^53]

#### Tam’s defence

51     The thrust of Tam’s defence[^54] was that NewAir was Li’s business. Li was the “boss” of NewAir and he had absolute control over the company. The share transfer of 51% to LDL was done because Li wanted to be the boss, to have complete control of the company. Tam’s agreement with Li was to share the profits of NewAir equally on a 50-50 basis. Everything was equal, including their salaries and expenses. Hence the payments made to Li were his share of the profits of NewAir. As to the cheque payments in the name of LL and LDL, Tam was merely doing so according to Li’s instructions.[^55]

### Issues to be determined

52     From the evidence presented, there was no dispute that Li and Tam set up NewAir together, and that Li worked for NewAir for which he received payment. It was also not in dispute that Tam transferred NewAir shares to LDL, handed cheques in the names of LL and LDL to Li, and gave various sums of cash to Li (set out at \[28\]-\[31\], above). What the defence disputed was that the shares, cheques and cash were gratification corruptly given by Tam to Li. There were two main issues to be determined at the trial:

> (a)     Whether the shares, cheques and cash were gratification given by Tam to Li; and

> (b)     If so, whether they were given corruptly.

53     Further, Li had challenged the admissibility of his statements to the CPIB and asserted that they were not voluntarily given by him. Hence, the voluntariness of the statements was also an issue that had to be determined at the trial at an ancillary hearing.

### Decision

#### Tam gave gratification to Li

54     The defence submitted that the shares, cheques and cash were not gratification given by Tam to Li.

> (a)     Li’s argument was that the shares allocated to him and the payments to him were earned by him in consideration of his technical expertise and contributions to NewAir. Likewise, the cheque payments in favour of LL and LDL were remuneration for the work _they_ had done for NewAir, and were not for Li’s benefit.

> (b)     Tam’s argument was that _all_ the shares, cheques and cash were _Li_’s remuneration for his contributions to NewAir, pursuant to their joint venture arrangement. As Li had absolute control of NewAir, the payments were given _by Li to himself_, and Tam was merely following his instructions.

55     On the evidence I found that the shares, cheques and cash were all gratification paid by Tam to Li. Tam’s testimony was that all the payments were Li’s 50% share; and she issued the cheques in the names of LL and LDL as instructed by Li (above, at \[51\]). Under cross-examination, Tam agreed that the reason for putting the names of LL and LDL was to hide from JSPL the fact that Li was involved in NewAir. The payment of Li’s share of profits was not reflected in the accounts of NewAir; they were reflected as payments made to LL, LDL and Tam herself to hide the fact that payments were being made to Li for his benefit.[^56] I found Tam’s evidence in this regard to be credible.

56     I found Li’s claim that the cheque payments in favour of LL and LDL were remuneration for the work _they_ had done for NewAir to be untrue. Tam testified that she had no personal knowledge that LL or LDL had done work for NewAir — it was Li who had told her so, and Li told her only _after_ the CPIB had commenced investigations into the matter. [^57]

> (a)     Li’s claim in court that LDL did work for NewAir was a bare assertion that was wholly uncorroborated. It was also directly contradicted by Tam, who told the CPIB in her statement that it was not true that LDL did work for NewAir.[^58] It was also inconsistent with Li’s statement to the CPIB, where he said that LDL “was not involved, directly or indirectly, with the business operations of M/s NewAir, be it locally or overseas”[^59]; and the payments to LDL were actually for Li, as LDL “did not actually perform any work for M/s NewAir”.[^60]

> (b)     Li’s claim that the cheques in favour of LL were remuneration for her work was also highly doubtful. LL’s evidence was that her work was merely Li’s personal assignments; she had never worked in NewAir’s office or even been to NewAir’s office; she had never met Tam before; she helped Li to print and photocopy some documents (at home) and did not know that she would be paid for the work.[^61]

> (c)     An engineer who was working at NewAir, Bruce Yu Jia Jun (PW7), testified that he did not know LL or LDL and had no knowledge whether they were involved in NewAir in any way.[^62]

57     Therefore, I was unable to accept Li’s claims that LL and LDL had worked for NewAir, and that the payments were meant for the work they had done. It was clear on the evidence that LL and LDL were Li’s proxies, and the payments to them were for Li’s benefit. The transfer of shares to LDL, the giving of cheques in the names of LL and LDL, and the cash that was given to Li, as stated in all the 34 charges, were all for the benefit of Li.

58     I was also not persuaded by the submission of Tam that Li had absolute control of NewAir and she was merely making the payments as instructed by Li, and that it was Li who had given the amounts to himself. The evidence did not support Tam’s submission. The truth was that Li was not able to enrich and pay himself out of NewAir’s profits without Tam’s agreement. Tam was one of the signatories for cheques issued by NewAir[^63] and no payment could be made by NewAir, including any payment to Li, without Tam’s authorisation. Tam was able to make the payments to Li as NewAir was profitable after securing lucrative contracts with JSPL with Li’s assistance. Tam herself benefitted financially. Plainly, the only reasonable inference was that Tam gave the gratification of shares, cheques and cash to Li as a reward and to induce his continuing assistance to further NewAir’s business interests with JSPL. (This is discussed in more detail in the next section.)

#### The gratification was given corruptly

59     It was submitted by the defence that the payments were not corrupt as the payments were made pursuant to a legitimate business arrangement between Li and Tam. NewAir had provided the most competitive products to JSPL. That JPSL continued to deal with NewAir and to buy products from NewAir even after CPIB investigations had commenced showed that there was nothing illegal or corrupt in NewAir’s dealings with JSPL.

> (a)     Li’s submission was that he had set up NewAir for the interest and benefit of JSPL. NewAir’s involvement had helped JSPL to save money. There was no conflict of interest for Li to work simultaneously in NewAir and JSPL. Even if there was a breach of JSPL’s conflict of interest policy, that did not amount to corruption.

> (b)     Tam’s submission was that NewAir was a joint venture. NewAir was profitable because the work done by the company obviously met with JSPL’s requirements. While NewAir may have had an unfair advantage over other vendors due to Li’s inside knowledge of JSPL’s requirements, that did not equate to corruption. At most it was a conflict of interest, and JSPL as the principal did not suffer any financial loss arising from this conflict of interest. The payments made to Li were not gratification from Tam: Li was the founder and majority and controlling shareholder of NewAir, and the monies were his share of the venture. The payments were not a reward or inducement.

60     Having considered the totality of the evidence, I found the arrangement between Li and Tam not to be as innocuous as portrayed by the defence. Li, while employed by JSPL, did assist NewAir in successfully quoting for JSPL contracts. He received gratification in the form of shares, cheques and cash payments authorised by Tam. Li was able to advance NewAir’s business interests with JSPL due to his position in JSPL and his knowledge of JSPL’s internal processes. In doing so, Li was clearly in a position of conflict of interest, a fact that Tam was aware of from the outset. Tam made the payments to Li to continue using his position and knowledge in JSPL to advance NewAir’s business interests with JSPL, from which she received substantial financial benefit. Plainly, the payments were objectively corrupt, and the gratification was given by Tam and received by Li with knowledge that it was corrupt.

61     Li’s assistance in advancing NewAir’s interests with JSPL was multi-faceted and critical to the company being awarded JSPL contracts. As a manager in JSPL’s HVAC section, he had inside knowledge of JSPL’s HVAC requirements. He was able to recommend successfully that NewAir be invited to quote, although NewAir was a new company with no proven track record (above, at \[16\]). He drafted NewAir’s TP for its first project with JSPL (above, at \[17\]-\[18\]). He oversaw the TBE process and was able to influence the CBE process to show favour to NewAir, to the extent of recommending the jobs to be awarded to NewAir (above, at \[20\]-\[22\]). He had access to confidential CBEs which contained information on the prices quoted by other vendors, and was in a position to help NewAir quote competitive prices to JSPL (above, at \[24\]-\[26\]). Tam testified that she would send NewAir’s draft commercial proposals containing NewAir’s marked-up prices to Li for his comments; she consulted Li on how much to quote to JSPL so that the prices quoted would be the most competitive.[^64] Li admitted that he would “give \[his\] opinion as to \[whether\] the quotation to JSPL is viable” and that the prices “cannot be exceedingly high and also cannot be exceedingly low”.[^65] All these gave NewAir a distinct advantage over its competitors. NewAir was able to ensure that its TPs met JSPL’s requirements and the prices quoted were lower than its competitors, so that NewAir was able to obtain jobs from JSPL even though it was a new entrant in the market with no track record.

62     Li’s involvement in NewAir and assisting NewAir to win JSPL contracts was not done gratuitously. His claim that he set up NewAir for JSPL’s benefit was not credible. The truth was that Li and Tam earned substantial profits through NewAir’s business with JSPL. The arrangement between Li and Tam was plainly for personal financial gain. Li’s continued involvement in NewAir was motivated by the payments to him of his share of NewAir’s profits. It was not as altruistic as he made it out to be.

63     Li did not inform his superiors at JSPL about his involvement in NewAir, much less that his involvement in NewAir was meant to benefit JSPL as he claimed. In fact, he _knowingly_ acted in clear breach of JSPL’s conflict of interest policy (above, at \[32\]-\[34\]), which was no doubt aimed at preventing corruption. Tam also knew that if would be a conflict of interest for Li to be involved in NewAir while being employed by JSPL (above, at \[36\]). “\[Where rules\] are specifically designed to prevent bribery, then breaking them will invariably lead to the finding of a corrupt element.”: _Chan Wing Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 721</span> at \[20\].

64     Further evidence of the corrupt nature of the arrangement between Li and Tam can be found in the furtiveness of Li’s involvement in NewAir. Although Li was Tam’s partner in the NewAir joint venture, his name did not feature in NewAir’s incorporation papers or its account books. The names of LL and LDL were used as the registered shareholder and director of NewAir to hide the fact of Li’s interest in NewAir (above, at \[40\]-\[41\]). The defendants went to extraordinary lengths to hide Li’s involvement in NewAir, even creating an alter-ego for Li known as “Forbes” (above, at \[42\]). Steps were also taken to hide the fact that gratification was being given by Tam to Li. Shares were transferred to LDL, cheques were written in the names of LDL and LL, and cash was paid to Tam (above, at \[28\]-\[31\]), even though Li was the intended beneficiary. None of these would have been necessary if the arrangement between Li and Tam was above-board and they had believed it to be so.

65     Accordingly, I found the joint venture arrangement between the defendants in NewAir to be corrupt. There was an objectively corrupt element in the giving of gratification by Tam to Li. Both Li and Tam were also subjectively aware that it was corrupt.

#### Voluntariness of Li’s statements to the CPIB

66     At the trial, the prosecution tendered various written statements made by Li to the CPIB. Li objected to the admission of the statements. He claimed that the statements had been involuntarily given as well as inaccurately recorded by the recording officer. An ancillary hearing was held to determine the admissibility of the statements.

67     The recording officer, PSI Peh Wan Hao Keith (PW1, “**PSI Keith**”), testified to the statement-recording process. He testified, among other things, that Li was allowed to speak in the language of his choice. Li chose to speak in Mandarin. He and Li conversed in a mixture of Mandarin and English. Before Li signed each statement, PSI Keith read it back to Li in Mandarin and invited him to make any amendment he wished. Li made amendments to some of his statements.[^66] He also signed on each page of each statement to confirm that the contents were true and correct. The statements were voluntarily given by Li. Under cross-examination, PSI Keith disagreed with Li’s counsel that he had threatened Li or denied Li breaks and water during the recording of the statements.[^67]

68     In Li’s testimony (which was given in Mandarin), Li testified that he was threatened by the recording officer. The recording officer threatened to visit his wife’s office and his son’s NS unit. His requests to drink water and go to the toilet were denied. Li also claimed to be not conversant in the English language; that he had difficulties communicating with the recording officer, and much of his statements did not reflect what he had told the recording officer. [^68]

69     At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I found the evidence of PSI Keith to be credible. The evidence of Li, on the other hand, had inconsistencies and was untruthful. For example, Li claimed to have had difficulties communicating with PSI Keith, yet he had no apparent difficulty understanding the alleged threats made by PSI Keith to him. Li sought to give the impression that he was not conversant in English (and so was unable to understand what had been recorded in his statement); but this was not credible given that Li had attended a two-year Master’s programme in Offshore Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University — which was conducted in English.[^69] Li amply displayed his felicity with the English language in court when, on a number of occasions, he answered — in English — questions posed by counsel without waiting for a translation of the question from the court interpreter.[^70] It was plain that there were a number of amendments made by Li to the statements; however, he gave very evasive answers when cross-examined by the prosecution on the opportunity that had been given to him to make amendments to his statements.[^71]

70     Overall, I found Li to be not a truthful and credible witness. His uncorroborated claims that the recording officer had threatened him and had not accurately recorded his statements was not credible. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I found that Li’s statements to the CPIB had been voluntarily given by him, and the statements were thus admitted in evidence.

#### Verdict

71     Having considered the totality of the evidence, I found that Li, an employee and an agent of JSPL, did corruptly receive gratification from Tam in various forms and on various occasions (as stated in the 34 charges), as a reward or inducement to advance NewAir’s business interests with JSPL. I found that the prosecution had proven the charges against both defendants beyond a reasonable doubt and they were found guilty and convicted on all their charges.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed penalties

72     A person found guilty of an offence under s 6 of the PCA is liable, for each offence, to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

73     In addition, under s 13(1) of the PCA, the recipient of gratification (Li) would have to be ordered to pay a penalty of a sum equal to the amount of that gratification.

### Deferment of sentencing submissions

74     After the defendants were found guilty and convicted, on 7 August 2018, written submissions on sentencing were prepared by the prosecution and the defence in the months of September and October 2018.[^72]

75     On 29 October 2018, when the sentencing submissions were due to be heard, the court was informed that a Magistrate’s Appeal had been scheduled on 22 February 2019 in which a sentencing framework proposed by the prosecution for the sentencing of corruption offences would be considered by the High Court. A decision was taken to adjourn the sentencing of the present matter until after the High Court had determined whether the prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework would be accepted and applied.

76     The High Court delivered its decision in _PP v Tan Kok Ming Michael and Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 207</span> (“**_Tan Kok Ming Michael_**”) on 6 September 2019, in which the High Court did not endorse the prosecution’s sentencing framework. In light of the decision of the High Court, parties revised and made fresh submissions on sentencing[^73], _superseding_ the earlier submissions.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

77     The prosecution submitted that, for the individual offences, similar sentences should be imposed for Li and Tam ranging from two months to 21 months’ imprisonment for each offence, varying according to the amount of the gratification involved.[^74] In respect of the global sentences, the prosecution submitted as follows:

> (a)     Li: a total of 52 months’ imprisonment, and a penalty of $956,600 under s 13(1) of the PCA.

> (b)     Tam: a total of 46 months’ imprisonment.

78     It was submitted that the dominant sentencing principles were general and specific deterrence, and substantial custodial sentences ought to be imposed. Various aggravating factors were highlighted. The offences were premeditated and planned, and the bribes were given and accepted pursuant to a corrupt arrangement. In order to execute the corrupt arrangement, the defendants took extensive steps to hide from JSPL the fact that Li was involved in NewAir. Li’s name did not appear in the registration papers of NewAir. An alter-ego was used to hide Li’s involvement in NewAir. The payment of the bribes to Li were concealed as payments to Li’s nominees (LL and LDL). There was sustained and persistent offending. The corrupt arrangement lasted from 2011 to 2014, with the bribes being given and received over a three-year period from 2012 to 2014 over 34 occasions. The bribes involved were large, and both equally benefitted from their 50-50 profit sharing arrangement.

79     Li abused the trust and authority that JSPL had bestowed on him; he abused his senior position as a section manager of the HVAC section to favour NewAir. In doing so, he contravened JSPL’s policies and acted improperly against JSPL. Tam was equally culpable for Li’s abuse of trust and authority because she procured them. She did so by entering into the corrupt arrangement with Li and giving him gratification, which both rewarded and continually induced him to keep on abusing the trust and authority that JSPL had placed on him.

80     The prosecution submitted that there was one additional aggravating factor that applied to Li alone. He was the initiator of the corrupt arrangement. It was he who brought up the idea of using his position in JSPL to get business for NewAir. There was a difference in culpability between Li and Tam, and the number of sentences that should run consecutively for Tam should be one less than Li.

### Li’s mitigation and submissions on sentence

81     Counsel for Li submitted that the appropriate sentence would be a term of imprisonment of six to nine months in total.

82     In mitigation, it was stated that Li was more than 50 years old. His health had taken a turn for the worse since the charges were brought, the trial and the long, anxious wait for sentencing. He had been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and, more recently, obstructive sleep apnoea. He had suffered two heart attacks and underwent two heart operations. His wife had divorced him, and his family was torn apart.

83     It was submitted that there was no loss or detriment to the interests of the principal, JSPL. There was no web of corruption and it was not a case where many persons were involved. Li was not in a position of great influence in JSPL and was not directly involved in selecting vendors for JSPL’s projects. The lengthy period during which the payments were made was due to project-based contracts between NewAir and JSPL (there were 12 projects) and not because Li was a habitual offender. Li was not the mastermind, and both he and Tam started NewAir as joint partners with equal shareholdings, and their sentences should be the same.

84     It was further submitted that Li should be given a sentencing discount on account of delay in the trial and sentencing process. Li was charged in court on 28 April 2016. There had been a delay of about 3½ years between the time of charging and sentencing. After Li was convicted on 7 August 2018, more than one year was spent waiting for the High Court’s decision in _Tan Kok Ming Michael_, which was released on 6 September 2019 (see above, at \[74\]-\[76\]). Sentencing submissions were adjourned to 14 November 2019 for the prosecution to re-consider their sentencing position. It was submitted that the delay in the sentencing had added to Li’s financial burden and taken a further toll on his health; he suffered mental anguish and agony while waiting to be sentenced. Li had been unemployed for more than five years (since 24 October 2014).

### Tam’s mitigation and submissions on sentence

85     Counsel for Tam submitted that a total sentence of six to eight weeks’ imprisonment plus a fine of $90,000 (in default, no more than six weeks’ imprisonment) would be adequate punishment. It was highlighted that the bulk of the charges (30 charges) related to the payment of monthly sums ranging from $1,200 to $12,600 over a period of 33 months, and a fine in the range of $3,000 as an average would be appropriate for these 30 charges, giving a cumulative total fine of more than $90,000. For the remaining four charges that involved larger amounts (charges 1, 25, 31, 33), it was conceded that the threshold for imprisonment had been breached and, in light of the mitigating factors, it was suggested that sentences of between two to three weeks be imposed per charge, with only two of these sentence to run consecutively to give a cumulative sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment.

86     It was submitted that Tam’s role was secondary to Li’s. She was not the mastermind or initiator of the corrupt arrangement. Li was the one who had suggested the business with JSPL and secured the business. Tam had no knowledge of the industry initially and relied on Li’s guidance and tutelage. The alter ego, “Forbes”, was created by Li, and was not Tam’s suggestion.

87     It was further submitted that this case did not involve a web of corruption. It was not an offence of a transnational character. The case was one of private sector corruption, and there was nothing to suggest that there were any public sector elements involved. No financial damage was caused to JSPL.

88     Counsel further highlighted that Tam was a first-time offender and submitted that she had co-operated fully with the investigations. Counsel also urged the court to discount the punishment to be meted out on account of the length of time it had taken from the verdict to the sentence.

### Sentencing considerations

#### Custodial sentence warranted as a deterrent

89     The dominant objective in the sentencing of corruption offences is _deterrence_. In the present case there was a clear need for deterrence – both general and specific deterrence. There were several aggravating factors in this case, as highlighted by the prosecution. The offences were premeditated and planned. The bribes were given and accepted under a corrupt arrangement between the defendants. Active and elaborate steps were taken to ensure that Li’s involvement in NewAir was not discovered by JSPL. The corrupt arrangement lasted from 2011 to 2014, and the giving and receiving of the bribes was sustained and persisted over 34 occasions from 2012 to 2014. The gratification involved was not small, and both defendants received very substantial personal benefit from their corrupt profit-sharing arrangement. In my judgment, a substantial custodial sentence was clearly warranted for the offences and would be consistent with the objective of deterrence.

#### Relative culpability of Li and Tam

90     Generally, in corruption offences, the giver of gratification bears equal culpability to that of the receiver and the sentences meted out should be similar in terms: _Chua Tiong Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 515</span> at \[21\]. For the individual offences in the present case, I considered it appropriate that the same sentence be applied for Li and Tam.

91     Overall, however, Li was more culpable than Tam and ought to receive a higher total sentence. I accepted the submission of the prosecution that Li was the initiator of the corrupt arrangement. It was he who broached the idea of using his position in JSPL to advance NewAir’s business interests with JSPL. In using his position and knowledge in JSPL to assist NewAir, Li abused the authority and trust that JSPL had placed on him as manager of the HVAC section. There ought to be a differentiation in the total sentence of both defendants to reflect Li’s higher overall culpability.

#### Sentencing precedents

92     In their submissions, parties referred to various sentencing precedents for corruption offences. Highlighted below are some cases involving the giving and accepting of secret profits, which were of some help in calibrating the sentences in the present case, both for the individual offences as well as the total sentence for each defendant.

93     The prosecution cited three precedents involving corrupt secret profit schemes in the private sector. The salient details of these cases are summarised in the following table. These cases illustrate the range of sentences that have been imposed (although the varying sentences imposed were not easily reconcilable).

94     The case of _PP v Leng Kah Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1264</span> (“**_Leng Kah Poh_**”) was highlighted by counsel for Li and Tam. It was submitted that _Leng Kah Poh_ was one of the most serious cases of private sector corruption in terms of the total amount of gratification received by the offender. Leng Kah Poh accepted over $2.34 million in bribes over 78 months and was convicted on 80 charges under s 6(a) PCA. He was sentenced by the District Court to 98 weeks’ imprisonment. Counsel submitted that, considering that in the present case the total amount of gratification was smaller ($956,600), the period of offending was shorter (33 months), and fewer charges were involved (34 charges), the total sentence for Li and Tam ought to be lower than the sentence of 98 weeks’ imprisonment meted out in _Leng Kah Poh_.

95     The prosecution submitted that dated sentencing precedents such as _Leng Kah Poh_ should not be relied upon, and more recent precedents reveal an upward trend in the custodial sentences that the courts have been imposing in serious private sector corruption cases.

#### Appropriate sentences

96     I first considered what would be an appropriate sentence for the individual offences. In my judgement, the culpability of both defendants and the harm caused was substantial. Considering the overall course of the criminal conduct of each defendant, a custodial sentence was appropriate for each individual offence, even for the offences involving relatively smaller sums of gratification.

97     In deciding on the length of the imprisonment term for each offence, a significant factor was the amount of bribe involved in the transaction. In _PP v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span>, the High Court held (at \[46\]) that the bribe amount is related to the harm caused by the offence. The higher the amount of the bribe, the greater the corrupt influence exerted on the receiver; larger bribes generally lead receivers into graver transgressions. In _Heng Tze Yong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 976</span>, the High Court stated (at \[25\]) that the amount of gratification involved was an important factor in determining the proper sentence for corruption offences.

98     While there was no evidence that the corrupt arrangement between Li and Tam caused direct financial harm to JSPL, that is not to say that no harm was caused at all. Corruption on the part of a senior employee of JSPL would no doubt have caused some degree of reputational harm to JSPL. Harm was also caused to the integrity of JSPL’s procurement process. Such harm could not be readily quantified but would nonetheless have undermined the interests of the principal, JSPL.

99     Having considered the range of sentences meted out in the precedent cases, and taking into account the facts of the present case, I calibrated the sentences for the individual offences as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="27.34%"> <col width="28.12%"> <col width="44.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Gratification</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Remarks</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than $3,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2&nbsp;weeks’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">In <em>Lee Seng Kee</em>, one week was imposed where the bribe amount was between $1,300 to $1,600.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$3,000 to $5,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One&nbsp;month’s imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$8,000 to $12,600</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2&nbsp;months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$37,800</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5&nbsp;months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">In <em>Lee Seng Kee</em>, two months was imposed for a bribe amount of about $40,000; in <em>Lu Sang</em>, five months was imposed for bribe amounts of about $10,000.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$100,000 to $118,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10&nbsp;months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$200,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$255,000</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20&nbsp;months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">In <em>Lu Sang</em>, the total sentence was 20 months’ imprisonment where the total bribe amount was about $275,000.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

100    As for the total sentence, the defence submitted that the culpability of the defendants and the harm caused in the present case was lower than that in _Leng Kah Poh_, and the total sentence ought, therefore, to be lower. I accepted that, comparing the facts objectively, the culpability and the harm caused by Li and Tam appeared lower than in _Leng Kah Poh_. However, having regard to the higher range of sentences imposed in more recent corruption cases, the sentence in _Leng Kah Poh_ (98 weeks’ imprisonment) should not be regarded as the high-water mark in arriving at the total sentence in the present case. I accepted the submission of the prosecution that recent precedents reveal an upward trend in the custodial sentences that the courts have been imposing on serious private sector corruption cases, which underscores the need for deterrence against such offences. For example, in _Lu Sang_ (2017), the total bribe amount of about $275,000 was much smaller than the $2.34 million in _Leng Kah Poh_; yet Lu Sang’s total sentence of 20 months (about 87 weeks) was close to the 98-week total sentence in _Leng Kah Poh_.

101    I accepted the submission of the defence, however, that there ought to be a discount in the total sentence considering the delay in the sentencing process. About one year elapsed between the conviction of the defendants and the passing of the sentence. I took this into account in deciding how many sentences and which sentences ought to run consecutively for each defendant, so that the _total_ sentence would be calibrated downwards slightly.

102    For Li, considering his overall culpability and the harm caused, and the sentences meted out in recent cases (such as _Lu Sang_), it was my judgment that a total sentence in the region of 40 months’ imprisonment would have been appropriate as a starting point. On account of the delay in the sentencing of this matter and applying a slight discount, I considered it fair to impose a total sentence of 34 months’ imprisonment, achieved by ordering the sentences for four of his offences to run consecutively. In respect of Tam, the total sentence ought to be slightly lower compared to Li to reflect her lower culpability. In my judgment, a total sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment was fair, achieved by ordering the sentences for two of her offences to run consecutively.

103    In addition, Li was ordered to pay a penalty of $956,600 under s 13(1) of the PCA (in default 10 months’ imprisonment). The penalty was the total amount of the gratification received by him in respect of the 34 charges.

### Sentences imposed

104    In summary, the sentences imposed were as follows:
