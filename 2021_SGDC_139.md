Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Workplace Safety and Health Act Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed – Proposed sentencing framework – Application of stare decisis

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9066/2021/01.\]

23 July 2021

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused company employed Mr Sanwar (“the Deceased”) who was part of a team of employees installing a tower crane at a shipyard located at Admiralty Road West (“the shipyard”). Mr Reymundo JR Foryoso Cuispag (“Mr Reymundo”), who was employed by the Accused as an Assistant Field Manager, was in-charge of the team. The shipyard was a workplace under the Workplace Safety and Health Act (“WSHA”). On 13 December 2017, whilst the Deceased and the team of workers were erecting the tower crane, the crane’s jib foot jerked upwards and struck the Deceased causing inflicting fatal injuries.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge for an offence under s 12(1) read with s 20 and punishable under s 50(b) WSHA. I sentenced the Accused to pay a fine of $220,000. The primary issue in this case was whether the court should adopt the Prosecution’s new sentencing framework, which they based on the sentencing framework laid down by the 3-Judge High Court in _Mao Xuezhong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 580</span>, or apply the sentencing frameworks laid down in the cases of _Public Prosecutor v GS Engineering & Construction Corp_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 682</span> and _MW Group Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1300</span>.

3       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence have appealed. The Accused has paid the fine.

## Charge

4       The details of the charge are as follows:

>      **DSC 900672 of 2020**

>     You, Manta Equipment, are charged that you, on 13 December 2017, being the employer of one Sanwar (“the Deceased”) at a shipyard located at Admiralty Road West, which was a workplace within the meaning of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), did in contravention of Section 12(1) of the said Act, fail to take, so far as was reasonably practicable, such measure as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of your employee at work, to wit, you had failed to:-

>> (a)    Adequately implement safe work procedures for the erection of a tower crane; and

>> (b)    Establish and implement an adequate lifting plan

>     which failures caused the death of the Deceased and you have thereby committed an offence under section 12(1) read with section 20 of the Act, punishable under Section 50(b) of the same Act.

## Facts

5       The Accused is Manta Equipment (S) Pte Ltd, and it was engaged to supply and erect, _inter_ alia, a tower crane (with luffing jib) (“tower crane”) on the vessel Kaombo Sul (“the vessel”). The Deceased who had been working as a rigger/signalman for five years, was deployed as part of the team involved in the erection of the tower crane on the vessel. The Deceased had been working on this job for three days prior to the accident. At the time of the accident, a 60 m long jib was to be attached to the tower crane and the Deceased and his co-worker were preparing to insert fixing pins to the jib foot.

6       Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) investigations revealed that the Accused had deviated from the crane manufacturer’s (“the manufacturer”) rigging configuration for the jib. To rig the jib to the tower crane, the manufacturer had stipulated that a 6 m long and a 4 m long lifting gear should be rigged to the jib at its 18th and 21st sling points respectively. This would ensure that the jib was suspended at an inclined angle of about 21o at the jib foot and ensure that the jib nose would be higher than the jib foot (“the manufacturer’s rigging method”), see diagram below

![]([2021] SGDC 0139_Image/[2021] SGDC 0139_image1.png)

7       The manufacturer’s manual also stated that “_for any assembly or dismantling operations not covered by normal procedures (example constraints relating to crane operating site \[…\]) please consult us_”.

8       Mr Reymundo was aware of the manufacturer’s rigging method. However, without checking with the manufacturer’s manual or consulting the manufacturer, Mr Reymundo decided to rig the jib by using two 6 m long lifting gears rigged at the jib’s 17th and 21st sling points (“Mr Reymundo’s rigging method”). Mr Reymundo had decided to use this method in an attempt to avoid hitting other structures on the vessel during the rigging operation. As a result the jib was suspended at a decline of about 4o at the jib foot, i.e. the jib nose was higher than the jib foot, see diagram below:

![]([2021] SGDC 0139_Image/[2021] SGDC 0139_image2.png)

9       As the Deceased and the other workers were waiting to insert fixing pins as part of the installation process, the vessel’s movement (resulting from the tide, wind or waves from other moving vessels) caused the jib connectors to dislodge from the jib. As a result, the jib foot sprung out of the connectors and jerked upwards striking the Deceased’s torso.

10     If the jib had been rigged according to the manufacturer’s rigging method, the jib foot would not have sprung out of the connectors as the weight of the jib would have been pressing downwards due to the inclined angle of the jib foot.

11     MOM investigations also revealed that the Accused had, approximately two months before the accident, rigged another jib not in conformity with the manufacturer’s rigging method, i.e. when the jib was lifted, the jib foot had been higher than the jib nose.

### The Accused’s failures

12     The Accused, as the employer of the Deceased, had a duty to take, so far as reasonably practicable, such measures as were necessary to ensure the safety and health of its employees at work.

#### Failure to adequately implement its safe work procedures for its erection of a tower crane

13     Under r 4 of the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations (“RM Regulations”), the Accused had a duty to take all reasonably practicable steps to eliminate any foreseeable risk to any person who may be working at the workplace, and where it was not possible to eliminate the risk, then the Accused had to implement reasonable practicable measures and safe work procedures (“SWP”) to minimise and control the risk.

14     The Accused’s SWP stated that during a jib lifting operations, the lifting supervisor was to check and ensure that all lifting points used to lift the jib strictly followed the manufacture’s specification. The Accused had referred to this SWP in its risk assessment but it had not disseminated the SWP to its supervisors or workers. The Accused had also allowed, as company practice, the use of two 6 m slings rather than a 6 m and 4 m sling as stipulated by the manufacturer’s rigging method. This practice deviated from both the manufacturer’s rigging method and the Accused’s SWP.

#### Failure to establish and implement an adequate lifting plan

15     Under r 4(1) of the Workplace Safety and Health (Operation of Cranes) Regulations (“OC Regulations”), the Accused was required to establish and implement a lifting plan in accordance with principles of safe and sound practice. The Code of Practice of Safe Lifting Operations (“COP”) stated that a lifting plan “shall include but not be limited to” a “provision of a safe place of work for all personnel during lifting operations”.

16     The Accused’s lifting was found to be bare and against principles of safe and sound lifting as it did not include several elements listed in the COP, including provision of a safe place of work for all personnel. This was apparent as at the material time, the Deceased was standing in an area where he could have been (and was hit) by the jib when the jib connectors dislodged.

#### The failures caused the death of the Deceased

17     The Accused admitted to the above failures without qualification and accepted that its failures were cumulatively a significant cause of the death of the Accused.

## Issues to be determined

18     The issues to be determined in this case are as follows:

> (a)     Should the court adopt the Prosecution’s proposed alternative sentencing framework (“ASF”) based on the sentencing framework formulated by the High Court in _Mao Xuezhong_?

> (b)     Should the court be bound by the doctrine of _stare decisis_ and continue to utilise the sentencing frameworks for offences under s 12(1) WSHA laid down in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_?

> (c)     The appropriate sentence to be imposed on the Accused.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

19     The s 12(1) offence is punishable under s 50(b), in the case of a body corporate, with a fine not exceeding $500,000.

### Antecedents

20     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

21     The Prosecution acknowledged that the High Court in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ had set out the applicable sentencing frameworks for offences under s 12(1) WSHA. Both cases utilised a two-step sentencing framework. At the first step, involving offence-specific factors, the court would decide an indicative starting point by determining the potential harm caused by the offence and the offender’s culpability. At the second step, the court would consider adjustments to the starting sentence to take into account offender-specific factors. It was noted in both cases that where the offender’s failures caused serious injury or death then this would be an aggravating factor that would merit an uplift to the starting sentence at the second step of the analysis.

22     The sentencing frameworks under both _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ placed greater weight, at the first step of the analysis, on the potential for harm when calibrating the starting sentence. The primary difference between the sentencing framework in _GS Engineering_ and in _MW Group_ was with regard to the harm-culpability matrix conceived in each case. _MW Group_, which was decided after _GS Engineering_, relied on a graph-based mathematical approach to establish the sentencing ranges. This graph-based mathematical approach was adopted from _Nurun Novi Saydur Rahman v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 413</span>, which set out a sentencing framework for an offence under s 15(3A) WSHA.

23     In _Mao Xuezhong_, a which was a 3-Judge High Court decision concerning an offence under s 15(3A) WSHA, the High Court rejected the mathematical approach adopted in _Nurun Novi_ and developed a new sentencing framework for offences under s 15(3A) WSHA which was broadly similar to the _GS Engineering_ framework. However, the _Mao Xuezhong_ framework differed from _GS Engineering, MW Group_ and _Nurun Novi_ (collectively “the earlier three cases”) in two significant aspects:

> (a)     When considering the level of harm caused by the offence, the court had to consider both potential and actual harm, in contrast to the earlier three cases where, at the first step of the analysis, only potential for harm was considered. In addition, the High Court in _Mao Xuezhong_ stated that if death or serious injury occurred as a result of the offender’s failures then the harm should be graded towards the top end of the high range.

> (b)     Under the _Mao Xuezhong_ framework, equal weight was to be given to harm and culpability when the High Court set the sentencing matrix.

24     The Prosecution, in the present case, proposed an ASF based on _Mao Xuezhong_, submitting that the ASF would provide greater consistency in the sentencing practices between WSHA offences (namely between s 12(1) and s 15(3A) offences) and it would resolve the differences between the _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ frameworks. The proposed ASF’s sentencing matrix was as follows:

25     The sentencing range for the offence would be based on the harm caused by the offence and the offender’s culpability. Thereafter, the court would consider the appropriate starting sentence within the appropriate range for the offence. At the second stage, the court would calibrate the sentence having considered the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors. The Prosecution’s ASF utilised the non-exhaustive offender-specific factors found in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_, with the exception that (i) the actual harm caused by the offence; and (ii) whether the breach was a significant cause of the harm, were excluded.

#### Application of the ASF to the present case

##### (1)   Level of harm

26     The Prosecution submitted that the level of harm was high. In relation to actual harm there was a clear causal link between the Accused’s failures and the Deceased’s death. The Prosecution submitted that the seriousness of the risk was also high and the foreseeable consequences of the risk was serios injury or death. The Prosecution submitted that the likelihood of the harm was heightened and, finally, the number of people exposed to the risk was the Deceased and one co-worker.

##### (2)   Culpability

27     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability was similarly high. There were two breaches which were significant deviations from the safe method found in the manufacturer’s rigging method, from the Accused’s own SWP, the RM Regs, OC Regs and the COP for safe lifting operations. The Prosecution accepted that the breaches were negligent but highlighted that they were systemic breaches, especially in view of the fact that deviating from the manufacturer’s rigging method was not an isolated incident.

##### (3)   Starting range

28     As the harm caused by the offence and the offender’s potential for harm were both high, the starting range under the proposed ASF would be a fine between $300,000 to $500,000, and the Prosecution submitted that an appropriate starting fine would be $350,000.

##### (4)   Offender-specific factors

29     The Prosecution submitted that there were no aggravating factors and accepted as mitigating factors that the Accused had pleaded guilty and had cooperated with the investigations. The Prosecution submitted that a $50,000 discount was warranted and submitted that a fine of not less than $300,000 was appropriate.

### Mitigation

30     The Defence submitted that the court should rely on the sentencing frameworks found in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_. It was argued that the Prosecution’s ASF was based on the sentencing framework found in _Mao Xuezhong_ which was for an offence under s 15(3A) WSHA and there was no clear authority in _Mao Xuezhong_ that the sentencing framework was applicable to other WSHA offences, let alone s 12(1) offences.

31     The Defence submitted that the Accused had obtained the necessary permit to work prior to commencing the work. SWP for the erection of the tower crane had also been submitted. The Accused had also prepared a Risk Assessment and a lifting plan. However, as there was a need to avoid hitting other structures on the vessel during the erection operation the manufacturers’ rigging method could not be used. Thus, it was submitted that the deviation was not a blatant disregard of procedures but necessitated by circumstances.

32     The Defence submitted that there were other contributing or intervening factors that led to the cause of the accident, namely:

> (a)     The vessel had moved suddenly and without warning towards the berth at the material time;

> (b)     That the re-positioning or shifting of the vessel by a barge or some other means was a real and plausible reason for the sudden movement;

> (c)     It was because of the sudden movement of the vessel, that the jib impacted against the Deceased;

> (d)     The Deceased could have avoided the impact if he had been positioned at the side of the installation at the material time.

33     Based on these factors the Defence submitted that the Accused’s culpability should be low.

34     With regard to the potential for harm, the Defence agreed that the seriousness of the harm risked could be considered high, but that the likelihood of the harm arising was not high as the movement of the vessel was brought about by external factors. As such, the Defence submitted that the potential for harm was in the medium category.

35     The Defence submitted that following the accident the Accused had fully complied with MOM directions to suspend work, the employees, including Mr Reymundo, have gone for further training by the jib manufacturer and work only recommenced after the further training.

36     Based on the sentencing frameworks in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_, the Defence submitted that the appropriate starting sentence should be $80,000 and that after considering the aggravating factors, i.e. that a death resulted, and the mitigating factors, an appropriate fine would be $90,000.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

37     The relevant legislative provision of the WSHA are as follows:

> **12\. —(1**)    It shall be the duty of every employer to take, so far as reasonably practicable, such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of his employees at work.

>      **20.** – In the event of any contravention of any provision in this Part which imposes a duty on a person, that person shall be guilty of an offence.

>      **50.** — Any person guilty of an offence under this Act (but not including the regulations) for which no penalty is expressly provided by this Act shall be liable on conviction –

>> **…**

>> (b)    in the case of a body corporate, to a fine not exceeding $500,000

#### Should the court adopt the Prosecution’s ASF or does the doctrine of stare decisis preclude its use?

38     I found that the doctrine of _stare decisis_ precluded me from utilising the Prosecution’s ASF as that I was bound to use the sentencing frameworks set out in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group._

39     Vertical _stare decisis_ (or the rule of binding precedent) constrains a lower court judge to follow and give effect to the decision of a court above him in the judicial hierarchy if the case before the lower court judge cannot be distinguished from the prior case (see Walter Woon, “The Doctrine of Judicial Precedent” in _The Singapore Legal System_ (Kevin YL Tan ed) (Singapore University Press, 1999) at 298), see _Peter Low LLC v Higgins, Danial Patrick_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHCR 18</span> at \[20\] to \[22\]. I would echo the Assistant Registrar’s findings in _Peter Low LLC_, that there is no doubt that _stare decisis_ applies in the Singapore judicial system and that I am bound by High Court decisions.

40     In the criminal law context, in _Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span>, the Court of Appeal noted that the trial Judge had appeared to disregard sentencing precedents that had been cited by the Prosecution. Chan Sek Keong CJ (as he then was) held that a lower court should respect the guidance given by a higher court in similar cases, even though the lower court judge may not personally agree with the view of the higher court: _UI_ at \[17\]. Chan CJ referred to Roch LJ’s decision in _R v David Angus Johnson_ (1994) 15 Cr App R (S) 827, at \[830\] where it was held:

>     \[A\] judge when sentencing must pay attention to the guidance given by this Court \[_ie_, the English Court of Appeal\] and sentences should be broadly in line with guideline case, unless there are factors applicable to the particular case which require or enable the judge to depart from the normal level of sentence. In such special cases the judge should indicate clearly the factor or factors which in his judgment allow departure from the tariff set by this Court.

41     Chan CJ held that the proper approach where a lower court judge disagrees with the guidance provided by a higher court would be for the judge to express his disagreement in the judgment and suggest that the guidelines or benchmarks in question be reconsidered by the higher court: see _UI_ at \[17\].

42     The decisions in both _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ provided a sentencing framework to be utilised by the lower courts when sentencing offences under s 12(1) WSHA. I noted that the 3-Judge High Court in _Mao Xuezhong_ did not specifically overrule either _GS Engineering_ or _MW Group_ in their application to section 12(1) offences. There was also noting in _Mao Xuezhong_ to suggest that the lower courts should not continue to utilise the earlier sentencing frameworks.

43     On the basis that both these cases are binding on the lower courts I am obliged to utilise and apply the sentencing frameworks in those cases. It was not open to me to disregard the guidance given by these established sentencing frameworks.

##### (1)   Are the sentencing frameworks in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ inconsistent with one another.

44      _GS Engineering_ first provided a sentencing framework for section 12(1) offences. In _GS Engineering_, See Kee Oon JC (as he then was), found that there was a need to review the sentencing regime for section 12(1) WSHA offences because it was found that precedent sentences were too lenient and the full sentencing spectrum of an offence under s 12(1) had not been utilised. See JC set out a sentencing framework, that required a court to first consider (a) the culpability of the offender; and (b) the harm that could potentially have resulted. Based on these two factors, the court was to take reference from a set of sentencing ranges to derive a starting point sentence. The sentencing ranges were tabulated as follows:

45     With regard to the culpability of an offender, See JC held that it would be dependent on a non-exhaustive list of factors: (i) the number of breaches or failures; (ii) the nature of the breaches; (iii) the seriousness of the breaches – whether they were a minor departure from the established procedure or whether they were a complete disregard of the procedure; (iv) whether the breaches were systemic or whether they were part of an isolated incident; and (v) whether the breaches were intentional, rash or negligent: see _GS Engineering_ at \[77(b)}.

46     With regard to the potential for harm, See JC held that it would be assessed by considering: (i) the seriousness of the harm risked; and (ii) the likelihood of the harm arising: see _GS Engineering_ at \[77(c)\]. After determining the applicable sentencing range the court would then derive a starting point for the sentence. The court would then consider aggravating and mitigating factors, in particular, it would be an aggravating factor if actual harm, i.e. death or serious injury, ensued as a result of the breaches: see _GS Engineering_ at \[77(d) to (f)\].

47     In _MW Group_, Chan Seng Onn J held that he was broadly in agreement with the two-stage framework adopted by See JC in _GS Engineering_ and it was apparent that he agreed with the non-exhaustive factors that See JC had stated out to be considered when determining an offender’s culpability and the potential of harm of the offence, with one exception, which was that Chan J had included a consideration of the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk of harm when determining the potential for harm: see _MW Group_ at \[26 to 28\].

48     However, Chan J departed from _GS Engineering_ in the usage of the sentencing matrix that See JC devised in tabular form, see paragraph \[44\] above. Instead Chan J conceived a sentencing matrix based on a “sentence scale graph”: see _MW Group_ at \[39 to 40\]. Chan J represented the sentencing ranges based on his graph in tabular form: see _MW Group_ at \[50\]:

49     Chan J also found that the maximum indicative starting sentence, i.e. derived after the first-step of the analysis, should be $360,000, which, bearing in mind the statutory maximum fine was $500,000, would give a sentencing judge sufficient headroom to further calibrate the starting sentence upwards to account for aggravating factors: see _MW Group_ at \[47\].

50     Turning to the second stage of the inquiry, Chan J held that the sentencing judge would then have to calibrate the starting sentence taking into account aggravating and mitigating factors. In particular, Chan J held that if actual harm was caused by the offence that resulted in death, then there could be an uplift of up to $200,000, depending on the number of fatalities. If there was serious harm caused, then the uplift could be up to $50,000, depending on the severity of the injuries and the number of persons injured: see _MW Group_ at \[60\].

51     Based on the description of the sentencing frameworks above, I did not find that the frameworks in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ were inconsistent with one another, rather that the sentencing framework in _MW Group_ was a refinement of the sentencing framework in _GS Engineering._

##### (2)   Is there a need to reconsider the sentencing framework applicable to section 12(1) WSHA offences in light of the 3-Judge decision in _Mao Xuezhong?_

52     In _Mao Xuezhong_, the 3-Judge High Court considered whether the sentencing framework for section 15(3A) offences crafted by Chan J in _Nurun Novi_ ought to stand. Tay Yong Kwang JA, writing the decision of the Court, in _Mao Xuezhong_ found aspects of the decision in _Nurun Novi_ difficult to justify on principle: see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[55 and 61\]. As a result of these objections on principle the High Court in _Mao Xuezhong_ was unable to endorse the sentencing framework in _Nurun Novi_: see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[61\].

53     Tay JA then crafted a sentencing framework that was broadly akin to the sentencing framework in _GS Engineering_ but incorporating significant differences to that framework_._ First, Tay JA agreed that the first step would be to establish the level of harm and culpability to derive a starting point sentence. However, it was held that the harm cause by the offence would include a consideration of both the degree of potential harm and the actual harm caused (that had a causal or contributory link to the breaches): see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[64(a)(i)\].

54     Tay JA stated that with regard to assessing the level of harm, the factors that should be considered included, (i) the seriousness of the harm risked, (ii) the likelihood of the harm arising, and (iii) the number of people likely to be exposed to the risk. It was held that if the harm was likely to be death or serious injury then the harm would be considered high even though that harm did not materialise. If death or serious injury eventuated, then the harm would be graded at the top end of the high range: see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[64(a)(i)\].

55     I noted that the non-exhaustive factors that Tay JA stated were to be considered in establishing harm were the same as the factors Chan J held, in _MW Group_, had to be considered in determining the potential for harm of an offence under section 12(1) WSHA, see paragraphs \[46 and 47\] above.

56     Tay JA held that the determination of culpability included a consideration of the (i) nature of the unsafe act, (ii) the number of unsafe acts committed by the offender, (iii) the level of deviation for established procedure involved in the safe act, and (iv) whether the unsafe acts were motivated by the offender’s desire to save on costs: see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[64(a)(ii)\]. I noted that the factors to be considered in determining culpability were very similar to the factors enunciated by See JC and Chan J in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ respectively, see paragraphs \[45 and 47\] above. Finally, Tay JA held that the sentencing matrix to be used should give equal weight to harm and to culpability: see _Mao Xuezhong_ at \[67\].

57     I found that in view of the 3-Judge High Court’s rejection of the methodology utilised in _Nurun Novi_ and its findings that: (i) a consideration of the harm caused by the offence should include both potential for harm and the actual harm caused; and (ii) that equal weightage should be given to harm and culpability in the sentencing matrix; that it is likely that the High Court would depart from the sentencing frameworks in both _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ when it considers an appeal involving a section 12(1) WSHA offence_._

58     However, as I have stated at paragraphs \[38 to 51\] above, I am bound by the decisions in _GS Engineering_ and _MW Group_ and, as such, it was not open to me to apply the Prosecution’s ASF.

#### Applying the MW Group sentencing framework to the present case

59     I would state at the outset that I found that the Defence had in its submission on both the level of the Accused’s culpability and the potential for harm failed to realise the seriousness and egregiousness of the offence committed by the Accused. I rejected the Defence’s contention that the Accused’s culpability should be pegged at low and the potential for harm should be pegged at medium.

##### (1)   Accused’s culpability

60     There were two failures in the present case. The first was a failure to adequately implement the SWP. The company did have an SWP for the “Erection of Tower Crane”. Paragraph 5.1.1.p. of the SWP expressly stated that the “_Lifting Supervisor to check and ensure all lifting points are followed strictly to Manufacturer specification. (Responsible person: Lifting Supervisor)_”. There were no other instructions in the SWP on how the tower crane was to be erected. Therefore, I found that the Accused must have been relying on the manufacturer’s rigging method as the only safe method to erect the tower crane, including rigging the jib.

61     The manufacturer explicitly recognised that there may be instances when the jib could not be rigged in accordance with the manufacturer’s rigging method. So there was an acknowledgment by the manufacturer that environmental conditions might preclude the use of the manufacturer’s rigging method. To address these situations, the manufacturer directed that they should be consulted on alternative safe methods. Thus, there was an avenue available to the Accused to check on a safe method to rig the jib as they had found that the manufacturer’s rigging method could not be used. It was wrong and irresponsible for the Accused to rely or allow Mr Reymundo to devise his own method.

62     Instead of consulting with the manufacturer the Accused devised or allowed Mr Reymundo to use its/his own method to rig the jib. The Accused’s method was inherently unsafe as it would result in the jib’s foot hanging higher than the jib’s nose, which was a completely different orientation to that conceptualised by the manufacturer as a safe method of rigging the jib. I found that, the method used by the Accused was a major deviation from the manufacturer’s rigging method and, in fact, it amounted to adopting a method that was the opposite of the manufacturer’s rigging method. This was compounded by the fact that the Accused did not even use the proper length of lifting gear.

63     I did not accept the Defence’s contention that the deviation from the manufacturer’s rigging method was not blatant but was necessitated by the circumstances. As I have already stated, if the Accused found that the manufacturer’s rigging method was unsuitable because of the environmental conditions then it was incumbent on the Accused to contact the manufacturer to devise an alternative safe method.

64     Despite having an SWP that specified that the manufacturer’s rigging method had to be used, the Accused admitted that it did not provide or disseminate the SWP. I found that having an SWP in place has little practical value if the supervisors and the workers carrying out the work do not know the details of the SWP.

65     However, I also noted that the Accused did have both an RA and an SWP in place. This contrasted the Accused’s offence, for instance, with the offender in _GS Engineering_, who, amongst other failures, had failed to carry out risk assessment or safe work procedures for the loading platform: see _GS Engineering_ at \[31\]. In the present case, I found that it was not the Prosecution’s position that the SWP was inadequate in addressing the safety concerns or in how to carry out the operation safely, rather that the SWP was inadequately implemented, including by not being disseminated to the workers. As such, I found that the Accused’s offence to be less egregious when compared to the offender in _GS Engineering._

66     The second failure was the failure to establish and implement an adequate lifting plan. The Accused did have a lifting plan and this was annexed to the mitigation, however, it was clear that this lifting plan was inadequate. I agreed with the Prosecution that the lifting plan was devoid of any details on how the lifting was to be carried out in a safe manner. In addition, the COP required the Accused to provide a safe place of work for workers during lifting operations and this would include the provision of safe areas for workers to stand during the lifting operation such that if there was an accident the chance of the workers being affected were minimised. The lifting plan submitted by the Defence did not provide any details on where workers should safely situate themselves during the lifting operation.

67     I found that both breaches were serious breaches as they were significant deviations from the manufacturer’s rigging method, the Accused’s own SWP, the RM Regulations, the OC Regulations and the COP for safe lifting operations.

68     I agreed with the Prosecution and the Defence that both breaches were negligent rather than rash or intentional.

69     I found that failure to adequately implement the SWP was a systemic breach as the occasion when the accident occurred was not the first time that the Accused had not followed the manufacturer’s rigging method and had failed to contact the manufacturer to implement an alternative rigging method. However, I disagreed with the Prosecution that the failure to establish and implement an adequate lifting plan was a systemic breach. There was no evidence led that the Accused had regularly failed to establish and implement adequate lifting plans.

70     In determining the Accused’s culpability I did not give any weight to the Defence’s submission that the unexpected movement of the vessel was a major contributory factor in the accident. This operation was being conducted by the Accused on a vessel that was moored on the sea. The sudden movement of the vessel as a result of wind, waves or current had to be something that was anticipated when the Accused was planning on how to carry out the operation safely. An adequate SWP and lifting plan should have taken these factors into account. In any case, if the jib had been rigged in accordance with the manufacturer’s rigging method then it was unlikely that the jib would have sprung out of the connectors due to a movement of the vessel.

71     I also did not give any weight to the Defence’s submission that the Deceased was a contributory factor in his own demise as he was standing in a position that was unsafe. By failing to implement an adequate lifting plan the Accused had not provided for safe areas for the workers to stand during the operation. Without any direction on the safe areas to stand, the Deceased was left to decide where to stand himself, and, unfortunately, the place he chose was unsafe.

72     In determining the culpability of the Accused, I also considered the level of culpability of the offender in _GS Engineering._ In _GS Engineering_, the offender admitted to three distinct failures: (i) a failure to ensure that the workers involved in the lifting operation were trained; (ii) a failure to implement a safe system of work by ensuring that there was a permit-to-work or a lifting plan and that the risk assessment or SWP were followed; and (iii) failure to provide fall protection equipment to its workers who were working at height. As there were more failures in _GS Engineering_ and the failure were more egregious than in the present case, I found that the culpability of the offender in _GS Engineering_ was greater than the culpability of the Accused.

73     In _GS Engineering_, See JC found that the offender’s culpability fell within the medium to high category: see _GS Engineering_ at \[85\]. As such, I found that in the present case the culpability of the Accused should be pegged at the moderate level.

##### (2)   Potential for harm

74     I found that the seriousness of the risk was clearly high as the operation involved the rigging of a massive jib and any accident involving the jib during the operation would very likely result in serious injury or death to the workers hit by the rig. I agreed with the Prosecution that the harm in this case was foreseeable as the Accused had completely deviated from the manufacturer’s rigging method. Again, I gave no weight to the Defence submission that the likelihood of the harm arising was not high and that the accident only occurred because of the vessel’s sudden movement.

75     Finally, the number of workers that were exposed to the risk was two, i.e. the Deceased and his co-worker. Based on these factors I found that the potential for harm in this case was high.

##### (3)   Sentencing range and appropriate starting sentence

76     The sentencing range, based on the sentencing framework in _MW Group_, would be a fine between $120,000 and $300,000 and, based on the framework in _GS Engineering_, would be a fine between $150,000 and $300,000.

77     Having considered the offence-specific factors once again, I found that the appropriate starting sentence should be at or just above the mid-point of the respective sentencing ranges. I fixed the starting sentence at $210,000.

##### (4)   Offender-specific factors

78     The principal aggravating factor was that the accident resulted in the death of the Deceased. I was guided by Chan J’s decision in _MW Group_ and imposed an uplift of $30,000 to the starting sentence: see _MW Group_ at \[71\].

79     With regard to mitigating factors, I accepted that the Accused company had pleaded guilty at an early stage, that it had cooperated with the investigations, that it had an otherwise unblemished safety record and that it had put in place post-accident rectification works.

80     Balancing the aggravating factor against the mitigating factors with the mitigating factors I imposed a fine of $220,000.

## Conclusion

81     I found that a fine of $220,000 was not disproportionate to the scale of the Accused’s offending and it was not a crushing sentence.

82     Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
