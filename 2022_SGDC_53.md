3       I further ordered a compensation amount of $3,176.22 (in default 5 days’ imprisonment) against the Accused, in favour of the victim in this case, Ms Rachel Bernadette Colond.

4       The Accused filed an appeal against conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       Whilst the Prosecution called a total of six witnesses, the Prosecution’s case rested largely on the evidence of the victim named in the charges, one Ms Rachel Bernadette Colond (hereafter “Ms Rachel”).

6       It was undisputed that the Accused and Ms Rachel were in a relationship at or about the time the offences took place. In the words of the Defence, the relationship was “_tempestuous_”[^1] in nature. The evidence from Ms Rachel about her relationship with the Accused supported that description.

### PW 1 Rachel Bernadette Colond

7       Ms Rachel testified that the Accused and her began a relationship from end of January 2018. The relationship was “_on and off_” until October 2018 (when the offences took place). Ms Rachel told the Court that in the course of the relationship, she felt like she often “_had to walk on eggshells_” as the Accused was “_possessive and sometimes, insecure_”[^2]. Accusations about her touching somebody else or meeting up with an ex-boyfriend would escalate into “_huge fights and violent behaviour_”, where Ms Rachel would get slapped until she confessed that she did it, even when she did not.

#### Incidents of violence

8       In her testimony, Ms Rachel described a few specific incidents where the Accused was violent towards her. There was an incident on 2 August 2018 where the Accused slapped her. She suffered a cut on her right eye and blood came out of it. On this occasion, Ms Rachel called the police[^3] but she did not tell them how she sustained the injury[^4]. In two other incidents, Ms Rachel described how the Accused punched her on the nose a few times at Khoo Teck Puat hospital[^5]; and another time in a taxi where he had punched her until the taxi driver had to bring her back to Tan Tock Seng hospital[^6]. Ms Rachel was not able to remember the dates of these two incidents. In the course of cross-examination, Defence Counsel pin-pointed these incidents as the “March 2018 incident”[^7] and the “May 2018 incident”[^8] respectively.

#### Incident on 18 October 2018

9       Ms Rachel testified that at that point of the relationship in October 2018, both the Accused and her were already “_on and off a few times_”. Each time, she felt she was ready to leave the relationship but the Accused would convince her that they should try again[^9].

10     On the day in question i.e.18 October 2018, Ms Rachel sent the Accused a message telling him that they could not “_do this on and off thing_”. She was “_very tired of going through this whole trauma already_”. Thereafter, the Accused called her and told her to meet him under her block of flats. When she met the Accused, he persuaded her to go back to his home to talk. Although Ms Rachel had arranged with her mother to go to the polyclinic that morning, the Accused assured her that it would be quick and he would later send her home in a “Grab”. Ms Rachel reluctantly got into a taxi with the Accused and went back to his home[^10].

11     At the Accused’s home, the Accused did not talk but instead, sat watching television. Subsequently, Ms Rachel got up from the sofa and went into the kitchen to speak to her female friend on the phone. The Accused followed her closely. To put him at ease, Ms Rachel showed him who she was chatting with but the Accused “_wasn’t very happy about it_”. The Accused then showed her his middle finger, uttered vulgarities and started saying bad things about her friend. Ms Rachel could not recall what vulgarities were used. She quickly hung up the phone with her friend. The Accused and Ms Rachel then returned to the sofa to sit down. She told him that she had to leave; that her mother was in the shower and getting ready (to go to the Polyclinic). That was when the Accused “_got really angry_”[^11]. The Accused then pulled Ms Rachel’s hair and gave her a slap on her face. She pleaded with the Accused to let her go, to which the Accused responded: “T_he only way you will be leaving is with your head turned backwards and uh, you will die without knowing the answers and even going to the hospitals won’t overcome your symptoms_”[^12].

12     Ms Rachel further testified that she got up to leave and at the door of the unit, she was raising her voice, asking the Accused to let her go and shouting for help. Under cross-examination, Ms Rachel confirmed that it was then that the Accused pulled her hair and slapped her[^13]. Thereafter, he punched her on her right cheek, asking her to quieten down. Ms Rachel remembered tasting some blood from that punch. She then shouted really loudly for help[^14]. After a while, the Accused opened the door and while Ms Rachel was squeezing her way out, the Accused pulled her hair and punching her at the back of her head on the right side and on the right side of her cheek and forehead. Ms Rachel referred to the right side of her face as the area where the punches mainly landed. The Accused was continuously hitting her until almost the end of the corridor as she tried to run away. As she perceived it, everything happened very fast. She did not even have time to put on her slippers[^15].

13     Ms Rachel managed to run down the staircase to the void deck (Accused was staying on the second floor) where she immediately approached a passer-by for help. She borrowed his phone to call the police. She then waited for the police to come. Both the police and an ambulance came. Thereafter, Ms Rachel was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in the ambulance. On 23rd October 2018, Ms Rachel lodged a police report against the Accused[^16].

#### Injuries on Ms Rachel

14     In her testimony, Ms Rachel informed the Court that as a result of the Accused’s physical assault on her, she suffered from diplopia (double-vision) and underwent two surgeries. At the time of the giving of her evidence, Ms Rachel testified that she still had slight diplopia but she was now able to carry out normal daily activities as compared to before when she could not even walk without assistance and had to hold on to something[^17].

15     The full extent of the injuries suffered by Ms Rachel and the treatment she received was covered in the medical reports of the doctors who examined and treated her. These will be discussed in greater detail in the course of this judgment.

## The Defence’s Case

16     The Accused did not dispute the fact that Ms Rachel and him were in his home at Block 662, Yishun Avenue 4, #XXX, Singapore 760662 on the day in question. However, he denied that he had done any of the acts stated in the charges; Ms Rachel had fabricated the 18 October 2018 incident in a “_spurious attempt to utilise \[the\] justice system to punish \[him\]_” who left her financially stranded[^18].

17     According to the Accused, the relationship he had with Ms Rachel lasted nine months or so. There were two major break-ups in the course of the relationship. The Accused’s testimony painted Ms Rachel as one who was taking “_weed_”[^19], adding that it was her drug habits that gave rise to various problems which plagued their relationship[^20], and the reason why he wanted to break-up with Ms Rachel several times. The Accused also denied the violence he was said to have inflicted on Ms Rachel on a few occasions prior to 18 October 2018 and offered a different version of events for each of those incidents[^21].

18     The Accused categorically denied assaulting Ms Rachel on 18 October 2018. On the day in question, the Accused testified that Ms Rachel wanted to talk to him. He then met her under her block to talk. However, she suggested that they go to the Accused’s place to talk. The Accused agreed and they headed to his home. At the Accused’s home, Ms Rachel begin talking about money and how she was in need. According to the Accused, Ms Rachel was shouting at his home and hitting herself on the arch of the kitchen entrance. The Accused then opened the gate and told her to leave. Ms Rachel did so. Shortly, when the Accused looked out of the window, he saw Ms Rachel being put in an ambulance on a stretcher. He did not think anything of it and continued with his normal activities[^22]. The Accused also related a conversation he had with Ms Rachel who called from the hospital, asking for money and also a call from his father who went to the hospital to see Ms Rachel.

19     The Accused called three other witnesses in support of his case. Their evidence will be discussed in the course of these written grounds.

## Assessment of the Prosecution’s Evidence

### Ms Rachel was a Credible Witness

20     Ms Rachel was the key witness in the Prosecution’s case. Having assessed Ms Rachel’s evidence, I found her to be a truthful and credible witness. The totality of Ms Rachel’s testimony in court relating to the nature of her relationship with the Accused was well-corroborated.

21     Ms Rachel’s description of the Accused as being possessive was evident from the history of WhatsApp messages tendered in court by the Defence (Exhibits D1 and D2). On a plain reading of the conversation following these WhatsApp messages sent on:

> (a)     3 June 2018 at 11:01:14;

> (b)     8 June 2018, 21:04:03;

> (c)     19 June 2018, 13:32:34;

> (d)     1 July 2018, 19:23:33;

> (e)     9 July 2018, 11:45:03;

> (f)     9 July 2018, 23:58:59;

> (g)     16 October 2018, 18:23:58;

> (h)     16 October 2018, 23:42:13,

it was apparent that the Accused was on Ms Rachel’s back when she didn’t pick up his calls; he was chasing her when she failed to reply to his messages. The Accused was also noted to be checking on Ms Rachel’s status on Facebook Messenger and insinuating that she was chatting with other people. The Accused attempted to explain the messages away under cross-examination[^23]. However, his explanations were unconvincing and they failed to overcome a plain and straightforward understanding of the messages which were consistent with Ms Rachel’s description of the Accused.

22     The physical abuse Ms Rachel mentioned she received at the hands of the Accused was also evident from the WhatsApp messages. Her testimony that the Accused had barged out of his unit and given her a slap sometime in July 2018[^24] was borne out in the messages sent from 16 July 2018, 15:53:24. On WhatsApp, Ms Rachel sent two articles which talked about physical abuse. The Accused responded with an apology at 16:44:49 on the same day. There was further evidence of the Accused using violence on Ms Rachel when from another message sent at 19:17:36, Ms Rachel asked: “_Have you slapped anyone else like this before?”; “Did they go through the same_?”; “_It was more than 10 slaps to the face_”; “_Body all pain_” to which the Accused again responded with an apology at 19:18:57. There was further discussion about the hurt and pain caused. It was clear from this WhatsApp exchange that:

> (a)     the Accused had slapped Ms Rachel on this occasion; and

> (b)     there had been previous occasions where the Accused had punched Ms Rachel with even greater force[^25].

It was equally telling that at no time in this conversation did the Accused refute Ms Rachel’s messages that he had punched her.

23     The testimony of Ms Rachel that the Accused had slapped her on 2 August 2018 was substantiated by her “999” call to the police[^26]. A photograph showing the cut that Ms Rachel sustained was also admitted in evidence at the last page of Exhibit D1[^27].

24     I did not find Ms Rachel’s inability to remember precise dates of these incidents of violence to affect her credibility. It was undisputed that the Accused and Ms Rachel shared a “_tempestuous_”[^28] relationship, and other than incidents of abuse, the relationship was marked by problems and occasions of separation, even sweet moments, as was apparent through the WhatsApp messages. It would not be reasonable to expect Ms Rachel to remember the precise dates of these incidents which took place in this short but eventful relationship.

25     As submitted by Prosecution, it appeared that the Accused’s assault on Ms Rachel on 18 October 2018 was a part of a broader pattern of abuse inflicted on her in the course of their relationship[^29]. Whilst I was able to accept that based on the evidence, I should be careful to add that I did not rely on previous incidents of abuse to arrive at a finding that the Accused did use physical violence on Ms Rachel on 18 October 2018. In my mind, it did not mean that just because the Accused had abused Ms Rachel on several occasions prior to 18 October 2018, he must therefore have also physically abused her on 18 October 2018. Conversely, that also meant that even if the Accused did not physically abuse Ms Rachel prior to 18 October 2018, it did not mean that he could not have done so on 18 October 2018. From that perspective and in my view, the absence of details relating to prior incidents of hurt and/or Ms Rachel’s inability to remember the dates when they happened (which Defence submitted affected Ms Rachel’s credibility), did not trouble me. It was primarily on a scrutiny of Ms Rachel’s evidence in respect of the incident on 18 October 2018 itself that I was satisfied that she was speaking the truth when she testified of the events which took place that day.

### Credible Testimony of Ms Rachel relating to the events on 18 October 2018

26     Turning to Ms Rachel’s testimony with regards to the events on 18 October 2018, I found her description of the incident to be clear and coherent. On the day in question, it was on the Accused’s insistence that she agreed to go back to his home to talk even though she was supposed to accompany her mother for a medical appointment. However, at the Accused’s home, instead of talking to her, he simply sat down at the sofa to watch television. Ms Rachel then spoke to her female friend on the phone. This action seemingly angered the Accused, drawing a reaction from him which appeared consistent with Ms Rachel’s description of the Accused as a possessive and jealous boyfriend. When Ms Rachel decided to leave the Accused’s home (in order to accompany her mother to the clinic) and conveyed her intention to the Accused, this was when the violence began. Eventually, she ran out of the Accused’s home and had to borrow the phone of a stranger to call the police. She made two calls as she was in unbearable pain[^30]. Subsequently, both the police and an ambulance arrived. The flow of events as recounted by Ms Rachel was logical and cogent.

27     The last message in the WhatsApp conversation between the Accused and Ms Rachel was significant. This was a message on 18 October 2018 at 6:23 am, sent by Ms Rachel to the Accused (Exhibit D2). In court, Ms Rachel summarized the message to be saying that “_\[they\] could not do this on and off thing; \[they\] had to make up \[their\] mind (sic) and come to a conclusion_”[^31]. The evidence of Ms Rachel in this regard was consistent with a plain reading of the message. It was specifically in response to this message that the Accused called Ms Rachel up later that morning and insisted that she go back to his flat to talk. The series of events which took place after the last message, eventually leading to the assault in the Accused’s flat flowed logically from Ms Rachel’s last message to the Accused in which she alluded to a break-up, being tired that the Accused would “_as and when \[he\]want, \[he\] will pull and push”.[^32]_

28     There were certain aspects of the evidence which Defence took issue with. For example, why Ms Rachel would go to the Accused’s home that morning when she had to accompany her mother for a medical appointment or why she would risk her own safety by being alone with the Accused. However, in the context of a relationship which they shared, I found it reasonable that Ms Rachel would have agreed to go with the Accused to his home (and believe that she would be able to make it back in time to accompany her mother for an appointment). There were issues between them to be ironed out. The Accused was also not a stranger or a mere acquaintance with whom she had simply followed home. That would have been inexplicable.

29     In respect of events following the physical assault, I did not think there was much to be made of Ms Rachel’s discharge from hospital which was against medical advice or making the police report of the assault only on 23 October 2018. When cross-examined, Ms Rachel explained that it was late and she was tired, in pain and she could not go through with the procedure of a Computed Tomography (CT) scan that day[^33]. She also clarified that after the incident, she was tied up with hospital matters and it was only after the hospital had scheduled an operation that she was able to make a police report so that “_all the evidence needed would be collected as soon as possible_”[^34]. Ms Rachel’s explanations were reasonable. In any case, even if there were questions surrounding Ms Rachel’s motivations behind an early discharge or a delayed police report[^35], such conduct on its own did not necessarily indicate that Ms Rachel had lied about the assault by the Accused. Considering the totality of the evidence before the Court, I was satisfied that Ms Rachel was telling the truth when she recounted how she was assaulted by the Accused at his home on 18 October 2018.

30     More importantly, Ms Rachel’s account of the violence used on her in the Accused’s flat was externally consistent with the events which took place after the assault. She was so desperate to get away from the Accused that she did not even put on her slippers but ran barefoot down the stairs whereupon she immediately approached a stranger for the use of his phone to contact the police. Ms Rachel confirmed that the contents of the call as seen in Exhibit P1 (First Information Report) was what she had conveyed to the police at the material time[^36]. The words “_I am just being punched by my boyfriend. Police please come_” was an immediate and spontaneous response of Ms Rachel to an assault by the Accused and it corroborated her testimony.

31     Further, her account that she made the FIR call from the handphone of a complete stranger was borne out in investigations. PW5 Sgt Balachandar s/o Katnasamy (“Sgt Bala”), the Investigating Officer of this case, confirmed that the number which was used to call for police assistance by Ms Rachel was not a local number (such that it might belong to Ms Rachel) but an overseas one. As a result, Sgt Bala was unable to ascertain the identity of the stranger whom Ms Rachel had approached for help that day[^37].

32     Ms Rachel’s account of the 18 October 2018 incident itself was also consistent with evidence of PW3 Station Inspector Muhammad Zaki Bin Muhammad Ghazali (“SI Zaki”). SI Zaki testified that when he arrived at Block 662 - the location given in the FIR call and attended to Ms Rachel (known to him as “the victim”), he was informed by her that she had a dispute with one “Elaiy” in a unit on the second floor. SI Zaki added that “the victim” wanted to accompany her mother to the doctor but the said “Elaiy” had refused to allow her to do so. A dispute arose and in the midst of it, he grabbed and punched her several times on the face[^38].

33     SI Zaki’s evidence relating to his encounter with Ms Rachel was significant in that it contained:

> (a)     details relating to the cause of the dispute;

> (b)     the place where the dispute took place;

> (c)     the identity of the person with whom she had a dispute with; and

> (d)     the ensuing conduct of the said person.

34     These details, brief as they may have been as related to SI Zaki at that point in time and now recounted in his court testimony, contained the essence of what happened between the Accused and Ms Rachel when they were both in the Accused’s flat that morning. These details, furnished contemporaneously by Ms Rachel, were highly consistent with her account and evidence in court. It was inconceivable that Ms Rachel would have spontaneously thought up these specific details to relay to SI Zaki when he came onto the scene if such an incident in fact did not happen. It bears noting that similar complaints of being punched on the face were also made to the doctors who later attended to Ms Rachel[^39]. In court, SI Zaki informed the Court that pursuant to the information given to him by the victim, he even went up to the unit #XXX to look for the “victim’s” boyfriend but there was no response to his knocking (there was no dispute that #XXX of Block 662 was the Accused’s home).

### Ms Rachel’s account was corroborated by her injuries

35     The injuries observed on Ms Rachel right after the assault were consistent with her account. Ms Rachel testified that the Accused repeatedly punched her on the right side of her face. SI Zaki informed the Court that when he saw Ms Rachel at the scene on the day of the incident, he recalled seeing some swelling but could not remember which part of her face the swelling was at[^40]. However, when SI Zaki referred to his entries in his record book in Court, he noted that he had observed slight swelling on the right side of the victim’s face[^41].

#### Medical Evidence

36     Medical evidence before the Court similarly corroborated Ms Rachel’s testimony in respect of how she had sustained the injuries.

37     PW2 Dr Kan Tsia-Chuen John (“Dr Kan”) was a doctor attached to the Department of Ophthalmology in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital when he attended to Ms Rachel. Both Dr Kan’s medical report dated 4 January 2019[^42] and his oral testimony confirmed that on visual examination, Ms Rachel was noted to have right periorbital swelling and redness; swelling of the upper eyelid[^43]. In his opinion, the injury found on Ms Rachel’s eye indicated a large fracture which required a substantial amount of force. Dr Kan added that in his experience, he had never come across anybody with a self-inflicted isolated orbital floor fracture[^44].

38     PW4 Dr Mi Fang Helen (“Dr Helen”), an associate consultant in the Department of Ophthalmology at Tan Tock Seng Hospital similarly gave evidence of Ms Rachel’s injury. With reference to clinical records on which a medical report dated 1 January 2019[^45] put up by a colleague[^46] was based on, Dr Helen was able to say that when seen on 25 October 2018, Ms Rachel had mild, minimal bruising around her eye, having improved from her initial visit at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Dr Helen testified that the patient’s account of being assaulted multiple times with a blunt force to the right orbital region was consistent with the clinical findings, adding that it would be blunt trauma of a “_significant force_” which can cause such an injury seen in the patient[^47]. In her evidence, Dr Helen shared the opinion of Dr Kan - that whilst such an injury may be self-inflicted in theory, it would be “_quite difficult and a lot of force is required_”. Like Dr Kan, Dr Helen had not come across such cases in her experience[^48].

39     PW6 Dr Constance Ang Li Shan (“Dr Constance”) was a doctor at the Accident and Emergency Department in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital at the material time. She was the attending doctor when Ms Rachel was conveyed to hospital. In her clinical notes, Dr Constance noted that her patient had right periorbital tenderness i.e. Ms Rachel had expressed pain in the area around the right eye[^49]. Her findings were documented in a medical report dated 4 January 2019[^50].

40     Medical records in the form of medical and hospitalisation leave also corroborated Ms Rachel’s account. She was given hospitalization leave from 26 October 2018 to 23 December 2018. As pointed out by the Prosecution, neither the authenticity nor the necessity of her medical/hospitalization leave was disputed. Exhibit P8 also confirmed that Ms Rachel’s diplopia and downward gaze limitations (caused by the assault on her eye) continued to linger on as late as Ms Rachel’s last appointment on 3 December 2018[^51].

41     The fact that the medical reports did not mention Ms Rachel bleeding in her gums or sustaining an injury to her neck or that the Accused was wearing rings while punching Ms Rachel did not trouble me[^52]. The main injury which Ms Rachel suffered as a result of the Accused’s assault was to her eye – an area of her face to which a large portion of the medical reports have focused on. It was not surprising that in the course of being examined by attending physicians, Ms Rachel may not have been so concerned with other bodily pains she had experienced as she was with the injury to her eye which affected her vision. The absence of rings worn by the Accused in particular, was also a detail which was peripheral to the fact that Ms Rachel had been punched in the face by the Accused. These “_inconsistencies_” so characterised by the Defence, did not affect Ms Rachel’s credibility.

42     I agree with the Prosecution that based on the medical evidence, it is clear that the Accused’s punches were the only plausible cause of Ms Rachel’s injuries[^53]. The injuries seen on Ms Rachel under the Accused’s block of flats and at the hospital were consistent with each other as well as with her account. Further, there was no possibility of Ms Rachel having sustained such an injury by other means or having any opportunity to inflict an injury of this nature to herself since she was conveyed directly to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) immediately by paramedics upon their arrival at Block 662 Yishun Avenue 4.

43     A suggestion by Defence that the injury could have been sustained in- between Ms Rachel’s initial visit to KTPH on 18 October and her subsequent visit to KTPH on 22 October 2018 was a mere speculation and inconsistent with the Defence’s claim that she had sustained it when she knocked herself against the doorframe in the Accused’s home. On the evidence, I was satisfied that the injury suffered by Ms Rachel was caused by the Accused punching her multiple times on her right eye.

## No Reasonable Doubt

### Accused’s Version of Events

44     The Defence’s case did not cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s evidence. The Accused’s account of events was against the weight of the evidence.

45     The Defence contended that Ms Rachel had gone over to the Accused’s flat on her own volition with the sole purpose of extorting monies from him. When she realised the Accused’s disinterest towards her demands, she inflicted harm upon herself by knocking herself while she exited the kitchen. At the hospital when she failed to get the Accused’s father (DW2 Rajamanikam s/o Saminathan) to accede to her demands, she discharged herself against medical advice without going through the CT scan so as to ensure that a serious injury will be detected by a CT scan later since the x-ray did not produce a favourable result which would allow her to teach the Accused a lesson through the justice system[^54]. There was also an assertion by the Accused that Ms Rachel had fabricated “_all these things up_” while she was high on drugs[^55].

46     The Accused’s defence was fanciful. After a lengthy cross-examination into the details of how Ms Rachel had knocked herself against the kitchen arch (thus sustaining the injury on her eye), the Accused eventually conceded that from where he was seated on the sofa, he could not actually see where Ms Rachel’s face made contact with the wall even though he claimed he heard the sound[^56]. The Accused’s position that Ms Rachel’s fracture was caused by her hitting against the kitchen arch also appeared to be a speculation on his part[^57]; as if he needed to explain how Ms Rachel could have sustained such an injury whilst she was at his place.

47     More importantly, Accused’s assertion that Ms Rachel’s injury may have been self-inflicted in such a manner was against the weight of medical evidence before the Court. It was contrary to the testimony of the doctors who testified that the fracture in question could only be caused by a significant amount of blunt force. Apart from the fact that it would be, in the words of the Prosecution “_perverse_” for Ms Rachel to have inflicted such an injury on herself[^58], on the evidence, there was no basis to find that such an injury could have been self-inflicted.

48     In respect of drugs which the Accused claimed that his girlfriend was taking, there was no credible evidence produced to support his assertion. As highlighted by the Prosecution[^59], all the Accused produced was a set of three photographs (Exhibit D3) which supposedly showed a packet of weed from Ms Rachel’s bag. However, there were no date or time stamps on the photographs[^60]. When shown Exhibit D3-1 (picture of the pink make-up pouch), Ms Rachel stated that she could not be sure if the pink make-up pouch was hers, adding that the comb seen in the picture was the Accused’s and that she did not use the brand of powder seen in the photograph[^61]. In court, Ms Rachel steadfastly maintained that she did not smoke “weed”[^62]. The Accused’s allegation that Ms Rachel had fabricated everything because she was high on drugs was also never put to Ms Rachel in that manner.

49     There was also no medical evidence to support Accused’s assertion that Ms Rachel was high on drugs. This was despite the fact that Ms Rachel was conveyed to the hospital shortly after the incident. Taking the defence at its highest: that the packet in the photographs Exhibit D3 was “weed” and that it belonged to Ms Rachel, there was still no good evidence before the court that Ms Rachel had abused drugs on the day in question so as to throw her description of the events that day into doubt.

50     The picture which the Defence attempted to paint of Ms Rachel – that she was “_free-loading_”[^63] on the Accused, “_leeched_” onto the goodwill and financial support the Accused gave her (and hence had cooked up this incident of assault against the Accused when she realised that the Accused was no longer going to provide for her) [^64], was far-fetched. Ms Rachel was candid and did not hide the fact that there were times when the Accused would pay for groceries, grab rides. Whilst she did not object to him doing so, it was a “_mutual thing_” as she also cooked for him at his home[^65]. In the context of a relationship which they shared, such an arrangement between parties seemed entirely acceptable.

51     Even though it was also undisputed by Ms Rachel that she had called the Accused’s father, DW2 Rajamanikam s/o Saminathan to go down to the hospital on the day of the incident, it was never put to Ms Rachel that she had done so for the purpose of blackmailing the Accused and/or his family, as argued by the Defence[^66]. Even if she had called the Accused’s father down to the hospital because she needed help financially, it did not mean that the Accused’s physical assault on her did not happen.

52     One would also appreciate that if Ms Rachel had indeed been financially dependent on the Accused, then making a false report against the Accused and “_feigned being assaulted_” would most certainly work against her. It was inconceivable what Ms Rachel could gain from making a false allegation against the Accused, other than incurring more of his anger and wrath. Further, if she had fabricated the entire incident of assault, “_motivated by her revengeful heart_”[^67], there would also not be a need for her to fake an injury of this nature and of such severity. To pad her false story and make it credible, Ms Rachel would have had to inflict the injury on her eye herself. Given the injury as documented in the medial reports and by the testimony of the doctors, this would be highly improbable. I thus rejected the defence put forward by the Accused.

53     To submit that Ms Rachel had fabricated the entire incident on 18 October 2018 just because she had lost or was about to lose the financial support from the Accused was also against the weight of the evidence before the court, particularly in light of the WhatsApp messages seen in Exhibit D2. The final message sent on 18 October 2018 was Ms Rachel telling the Accused how she truly felt and a plea for the Accused to simply make up his mind about their relationship; it was not about her pleading with him not to break-up with her.

### Defence Witnesses

54     The Defence’s three witnesses did not aid the Accused’s case.

55     DW2 Rajamanikam s/o Saminathan (“Mr Raja”), the Accused’s father appeared prejudiced against Ms Rachel when he testified how he knew from the first time that he saw her that she was “_not a good lady”;_ he told the Accused that she was “_no good_”, “_already a married woman_”, “_having a child_” and “_lying completely_” after reading her palm**_[^68]_**. That aside, the testimony of Mr Raja did not go in any way to affect the truth of Ms Rachel’s testimony in relation to the events on 18 October 2018. Mr Raja had gone down to KTPH when Ms Rachel called him. As mentioned, even if she had called the Accused’s father down to the hospital because she wanted money from Mr Raja**_[^69]_**, it did not mean that the assault by the Accused did not happen. The fact remained that Mr Raja was not present in the Accused’s flat on 18 October 2018; he had no personal knowledge of what happened between the Accused and Ms Rachel in the Accused’s flat that day.

56     As outlined by the Prosecution[^70], DW3 V M S Prakash Chettier s/o Valiyatham Mathivathanan (“Mr Prakash”) was called to testify that one, Ms Rachel had been sent to the hospital in May 2018 because she had fallen down outside a club and two, that she continued to go clubbing in December 2018 – an event which suggested that Ms Rachel’s injury had feigned injury or it was not as severe as it was made out to be. However, under cross-examination, Mr Prakash conceded that he did not actually see Ms Rachel falling down in May 2018; he had taken the Accused’s word for it. Further, Mr Prakash testified that in this incident, it was Ms Rachel’s knee that was injured, not her face[^71]. This evidence was inconsistent with the Accused’s assertion that Ms Rachel’s nose injury (which she testified was due to the Accused punching her in the taxi) was due to the fall. In relation to Mr Prakash’s claim that Ms Rachel was clubbing in December 2018, I was circumspect in accepting its entire truth, being mindful of Mr Prakash’s relationship with the Accused. Further, Mr Prakash’s testimony could not be reconciled with the objectively serious state of Ms Rachel’s injury as borne out in the medical reports[^72].

57     DW4 Senthilnathan s/o Jayanathan (“Mr Senthil”), another childhood friend of the Accused, also came to court and testified that Ms Rachel had gone clubbing at least twice in October and November 2018. Again, as Prosecution noted, Mr Senthil’s claims could not square with the objective medical evidence[^73]. In the face of objective medical evidence that Ms Rachel had to undergo reconstructive surgery and was on hospitalization leave in that period of time and still suffering from downward gaze limitation in her right eye movements in December 2018, I did not prefer Mr Prakash’s evidence.

## Decision of the Court at Close of the Case

58     From the outset, there was no dispute by the Accused that Ms Rachel and him were alone in his flat at Block 662 Yishun Avenue 4, #XXX, Singapore 760662 in the morning of 18 October 2018. Having assessed the totality of the evidence in the Prosecution’s case, I was amply satisfied that the elements of the four charges, founded in a single incident which took place on 18 October 2018, were made out against the Accused. Minor inconsistencies in Ms Rachel’s description of the details of the assault did not trouble me as I bore in mind the pace at which the events in the flat took place. The scenario in the Accused’s flat that morning was not a static one such that Ms Rachel should be expected to describe it perfectly.

59     Following the sequence of events as described by Ms Rachel to the best of her ability:

### MAC 911542/2019 - Section 3(1)(a) POHA

60     The act of pointing a middle finger was insulting behaviour defined under section 3(1)(a) POHA; this was also something the Accused agreed with[^74]. The intention to be ordinarily inferred by such conduct would be to cause harassment, alarm or distress to the person targeted by such a gesture.

61     In this regard, I accepted Ms Rachel’s evidence. She testified that the Accused was unhappy that she had been speaking on the phone when she was at his flat. He then pointed his middle finger and hurled vulgarities at her, which led her to hang up the phone hurriedly. She was fearful that the Accused was “_going to start something_” since her experience with the Accused caused her to believe that when the Accused started behaving in such a manner, it would usually escalate into a very “_long drawn-out incident_”, sometimes ending in violence[^75]. I found that the Accused did cause Ms Rachel harassment by his behaviour.

### MAC 911543/2019 - Section 5(1)(a)(i) POHA

62     I agree with the Prosecution that the words “_the only way you are leaving the unit is with your head turned backwards and you will die without knowing any of your answer”_ were objectively threatening[^76]. The Accused agreed that they were effectively a “_curse_”[^77] and that the phrase meant that the hearer could only leave the place if he or she was killed[^78].

63     I accepted Ms Rachel’s evidence that the Accused had used these words on her when she expressed to the Accused that she had to leave (the flat) to accompany her mother for the medical appointment. In the moments preceding the use of these words, the Accused had asked Ms Rachel to decide whether it was more important to go to the doctor with her mother or to sit there to talk to him. Ms Rachel gave evidence that when she informed the Accused that she had to leave, the Accused “_got really angry_”.[^79]. Thereafter, these words were uttered. The threat sat well with Ms Rachel’s description of events. The words used by the Accused had specific reference to Ms Rachel’s intention to leave the unit and were clearly directed at her to forcefully deter her from carrying out her intention to leave his place.

64     It did not trouble me that Ms Rachel was able to remember the words of the threat. These words were not words ordinarily used in the course of a conversation or even an argument. The incident was also memorable for the extreme hurt Ms Rachel suffered that day. It also marked the end of their relationship[^80]. After 18 October 2018, there were no further WhatsApp messages exchanged between Ms Rachel and the Accused, as seen in Exhibit D2.

65     I was satisfied that the Accused did use these words on Ms Rachel and intended to cause Ms Rachel to believe that violence would be used by him on her if she left the flat.

### MAC 911544/2019 – Section 323 Penal Code

66     In relation to this charge, I accepted Ms Rachel’s evidence that as she was leaving, the Accused pulled her by the hair and slapped her face. Ms Rachel confirmed under cross-examination that it was a slap on her right cheek[^81]. I found Ms Rachel’s account of this incident of hurt to be consistent with how the events were unfolding that morning. There was neither tendency nor need on Ms Rachel’s part to embellish her account with this additional incident of hurt, bearing in mind that the most serious injury which had occurred was to her eye and that had already been fully accounted for in her testimony as well as documented in medical reports.

67     On the evidence, I found that the Accused did have the intention to cause hurt to Ms Rachel when he grabbed her hair, pulled it (and in so doing, pulled her towards himself), and then slapped her on her right cheek. Hurt was caused to Ms Rachel as a result.

### DAC 932849/2019 - Section 325 Penal Code

68     On the evidence, it cannot be disputed that Ms Rachel suffered grievous hurt in the form of a right orbital floor fracture. As noted by the Prosecution, the Defence did not dispute the accuracy or reliability of the various medical reports which documented Ms Rachel’s injuries[^82].This was an injury which clearly fell within the definition of “_grievous hurt_” under section 320(g) of the Penal Code.

69     Ms Rachel testified that the Accused was the one who caused the injury, having repeatedly punched her on the right side of her face with his fist. This act of the Accused was clearly described in her testimony in court and remained firm under rigorous cross-examination. The only explanation for the injury on Ms Rachel which was corroborated by objective medical evidence, was that the Accused was the one who had caused it by the use of his violence on her. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, I was satisfied as to the truth of Ms Rachel’s account.

70     Having considered the totality of the evidence and the strength of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that that Prosecution had proved all the charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore convicted the Accused on all the four charges.

## Reasons for the Sentence

72     Except for a conviction for drink-driving under the Road Traffic Act in 2016, the Accused had no other convictions. Defence’s mitigation plea mainly dealt with the facts for consideration in respect of each charge which the Accused had been convicted on[^83].

### POHA charges

#### MAC 911542/2019 - Section 3(1)(a) p/u section 3(2) POHA

73     The punishment for an offence under section 3(1)(a) POHA punishable under section 3(2) POHA is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

74     In this case, I was of the view that a fine would suffice. The insulting gesture was one of showing a middle finger. There were no other aggravating features which increased the Accused’s culpability viz-a-viz this particular offence. Since the other acts which were connected with and/or occurred in the same transaction formed the subject matter of other charges, it was not appropriate to consider them in arriving at the appropriate sentence. On this charge alone, I was satisfied that a fine in the mid-range of the range of fines prescribed, would be sufficient. I thus imposed a fine of $3,000 (in default one week’s imprisonment).

#### MAC 911543/2019 - Section 5(1)(a)(i) p/u under section 5(2) POHA

75     For the offence under section 5(1)(a)(i) POHA punishable under section 5(2) POHA, the prescribed punishment was a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

76     In imposing an imprisonment term of one week, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed. The words uttered were highly threatening; one which carried a death threat, as opposed to words which were abusive or insulting. They were calculated to cause Ms Rachel to believe that she would die if she were to leave his flat as she intended to. A short custodial sentence which reflected the gravity of the threat, was appropriate.

### Hurt Charges under Penal Code

#### MAC 911544/2019 – Section 323 Penal Code

77     An offence under section 323 of the Penal Code carried a fine which may extend to $5000 or to imprisonment which may extend to two years, or to both.

78     As submitted by the Prosecution[^84], the framework for sentencing Section 323 Penal Code offences is set out in _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”) These benchmarks applied to first-time offenders who pleaded guilty.

79     In light of the hurt caused to Ms Rachel, the case fell into Band 1 of the _Low Song Chye_ framework where harm caused was “_low_”, with Ms Rachel suffering minor hurt with the slap to her right cheek and her hair being pulled. As indicated, the appropriate sentence under Band 1 ranged from a fine to a short custodial sentence up to four weeks’ imprisonment.

80     In imposing a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment, I took into account the fact that there was a fair measure of violence demonstrated when the Accused grabbed the hair of Ms Rachel, pulled her towards him and slapped her. I was of the view that a fine would be inadequate; the custodial threshold had been crossed. On a slight upward calibration bearing in mind that the Accused had claimed trial to the charge, I was satisfied that a custodial term of three weeks was appropriate.

#### DAC 932849/2019 - Section 325 Penal Code

81     An offender convicted under section 325 of the Penal Code may suffer an imprisonment term up to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

82     Both the Prosecution and the Defence cited the Court of Appeal case of _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“BDB”). In _BDB_, a two-step sentencing approach in respect of section 325 Penal Code cases was set out at \[55\]:

> (a)     First step: To identify the indicative starting point for sentencing based on the seriousness of the injury;

> (b)     Second step: To consider necessary adjustments upwards or downwards to the indicative starting point, based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

83     Applying the approach in _BDB_, both the Prosecution and the Defence arrived at similar starting points of sentence. Taking reference from the case of _Public Prosecutor v Cheng Boon_ \[2017\] SGDC 782 (“_Cheng Boon_”) where a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment was imposed, Prosecution was of the view that an appropriate starting point would be 9-10 months’ imprisonment[^85]. As for the Defence, it was submitted that the starting point should be an “_approximate 10-month imprisonment”[^86]._

84     I agreed that the indicative starting point for the sentence should be 9 to 10 months’ imprisonment. As highlighted by the Prosecution[^87], Ms Rachel sustained amongst other injuries, a right orbital floor fracture, which resulted in a downgaze restriction and persistent double vision that required surgical correction. She was given two months of hospitalisation leave, and still experienced slight diplopia as of January 2021. The victim in _Cheng Boon_ similarly suffered an orbital fracture which impaired his vision for some time and which required surgical correction. Her injury was no less serious than the victim in _Cheng Boon_. The offender in _Cheng Boon_, who claimed trial, received a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment and the sentence was upheld on appeal.

85     I then considered if adjustments needed to be made to the indicative starting sentence, based on an assessment of the Accused’s culpability and relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors, if any. None were to be made. I did not find any mitigating factors in this case. Accused had claimed trial and therefore, he was not entitled to any sentencing discount. As acknowledged by Prosecution, there were also no aggravating factors which increased his culpability[^88].

## Aggregate Sentence

86     I agreed with Prosecution that the charges under POHA and the Penal Code ought to run consecutively as they protected distinct interests. However, contrary to what was submitted by the Prosecution[^89], I did not consider it appropriate to order the imprisonment term imposed on the section 323 Penal Code offence to run consecutively with the imprisonment term imposed on the 325 Penal Code offence. Given the testimony of Ms Rachel, it was clear that although these two incidents of hurt may be viewed distinctly for purposes of prosecution, they were part of one transaction. The series of events unfolded swiftly that morning in the Accused’s flat and these two incidents of hurt occurred extremely close in time. Running the sentences in these two charges consecutively would in my view, breach the one-transaction rule.

87     Having said that, I was of the view that it was needful to impose an appropriate aggregate sentence which reflected the overall violence the Accused exacted on Ms Rachel in this single episode on 18 October 2018. Hence, I preferred an imprisonment term of 10 months on the section 325 Penal Code charge and ordered it to run consecutively with the sentence of 1 week’s imprisonment imposed in MAC 911543/2019. The total sentence was: 10 months and 1 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $3,000 (in default 1 week's imprisonment). I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence was not crushing or excessive.

## Conclusion

88     On Prosecution’s application, I made a compensation order in the sum of $3,176.22 in favour of Ms Rachel. This figure of $3,176.22 fairly represented only the total amount Ms Rachel had paid out-of-pocket, either in cash or by way of monies from her Central Provident Fund, and did not include any expenses covered by government subsidies or insurance pay-outs[^90]. The Defence did not make any submissions in respect of the compensation amount sought for by the Prosecution.

89     The Accused filed a Notice of Appeal on the day sentence was passed. On Defence’s application, a stay of execution was granted on the imprisonment term, the payment of the fine as well as the compensation order. The Accused is currently on bail, pending the hearing of the appeal.
