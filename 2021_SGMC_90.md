Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9237/2021/01.\]

31 December 2021

### Principal District Judge Toh Han Li:

## Introduction

1       The accused was tried on the following two charges:

> **MAC-909645-2019** **(“1st Charge”)**

> You…are charged that you, on 6 July 2018, at or about 08.20am, in Singapore, on board public transport, bus service number 960, did use criminal force on one V1, Female, 26 years old, to wit, you used your hand to touch the left side of her chest, below her armpit near her left breast, knowing it likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said V1, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> **MAC-909646-2019** **(“2nd Charge”)**

> You…are charged that you, on 7 August 2018, at or about 07.50am, in Singapore, on board public transport, bus service number 161, did use criminal force on one V2, Female, 18 years old, to wit, you used your hand to touch her right breast, knowing it likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said V2, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

2       The accused consented to have both charges tried together. The 1st charge was amended by the prosecution at the close of the prosecution’s case in respect of the specificity of the area where V1 was touched by the accused. This will be elaborated on below.

3       At the end of the trial, I convicted him of both charges and sentenced him to one month’s imprisonment on the 1st charge and five months’ imprisonment on the 2nd charge with both imprisonment terms to run consecutively, leading to a global sentence of six months’ imprisonment. He has appealed against his conviction and sentence and is on bail pending the appeal.

## The prosecution’s evidence on the 1st charge

4       On 6 July 2018 at around 7.58am, the accused was the first person to board SMRT bus service 960 at Woodlands Interchange. This was ascertained from the CCTV footage (“P6”) tendered by the prosecution. V1 (“PW 3”) then boarded the bus and walked past the accused and sat down at a window seat at the second last row on the left hand side of the bus (the left side as one faced the front of the bus).

5       Station Inspector Quek Chaw Yuen’s (PW 5) (“SI Quek”) evidence was that he was the duty officer at Ang Mo Kio Police Division HQ on 6 July 2018 and he had received several video clips from Crime Strike Force officer Inspector Siti Fatimah (“PW 6”) who had obtained the video clips form SMRT. SI Quek reviewed the videos and one video clip showed that the accused initially sat down whereupon he then changed his seat such that he was sitting directly behind V1. SI Quek testified that the video clips were stored in his laptop hard disk but his laptop subsequently crashed and he was unable to retrieve the footage. Inspector Siti Famitah testified that she no longer had the footage on her handphone as she had changed her handphone subsequently.

6       SI Quek however managed to save two videos clips separately in a CD which was tendered in court and admitted as P6 and P7. This showed the accused as the first person boarding the bus (P6) and the instance when the incident happened (P7). The video clips of the accused sitting down and changing his seat as well as when he exited the bus were no longer available. The screenshot of Inspector Siti Fatimah message to SI Quek was admitted as P9. In P9, the description for the two video clips that could no longer be retrieved were described by Inspector Siti Fatimah as “He sits first. He see complt he change sit \[sic\] behind compt” for one video clip and “Suspect exit after incident” for the other video clip. Inspector Siti Fatimah had reviewed the video clips and what she saw was that the accused had seen V1 on the bus when he sat down and then moved from his single seat on the right side of the bus (the right side as one faced the front of the bus) and sat behind V1 who sat on the left side of the bus (the left side as one faced the front of the bus). The moment V1 sat down, the accused shifted from his single seat to sit behind her.

7       During the journey, V1 testified that she felt something touching the left side of her chest and stated that the location where she was touched was the gap between her arm and the left side of her left breast. She testified that the “pressure applied was so hard that \[her\] bra shifted”.

8       She then used her right hand to reach across her chest to touch the left side of her breast where she felt the accused’s fingers.

9       V1 testified that the accused’s hand was awkwardly placed in the gap between her seat and the window and based on what she saw, the accused had used his right hand to touch her through the gap between her seat and the window.

10     She testified that she had gotten up from her seat shortly after the incident and stood in the aisle as she felt very uncomfortable sitting in front of him.

11     About five minutes later, she texted her husband (“PW 4”) informing him that she had been “molested by a guy”. PW4 testified that V1 had informed him that she was touched on the breast and he then called her to find out the details of what happened. He asked her if the touch was accidental or intentional and V1 said that it was intentional. PW4 advised V1 to make a police report.

12     On the same day of the incident, 6 July 2018 at 2.14pm, V1 made a police report P5. In her police report P5 she stated that she got to know that his fingers were on the left side of her breast area when she felt something was touching her. She felt extremely uncomfortable, bent forward and looked behind and stared at the accused. His fingers were between the seat gap and his eyes were half open and she assumed that he was pretending to be asleep. She then got off her seat and stood at the passageway.

## The prosecution’s evidence on the 2nd charge

13     On 7 August 2018 at around 7.09am (based on CCTV footage P3), V2 (“PW1”) boarded SBS bus service 161 before the accused. She chose to sit on the upper deck of the bus on a window seat of a row of seats located towards the middle of the upper deck on the left hand side of the bus (the left side as one faced the front of the bus). By the time the accused had boarded the bus around 7.30am (based on CCTV footage P4), there was an empty row of seats three rows in front of V2 which the accused walked past and several vacant aisle seats on the right hand side of the bus. The accused sat on the aisle seat beside V2 on her right.

14     V2 testified that she had fallen asleep during the journey. While she was asleep, she felt pressure on her right breast and quickly woke up and looked down to see what it was. She noticed the fingers of the accused’s right hand touching her right breast. Her evidence was that she was touched on the right side of her right breast at an area which was slightly above the nipple area. Once the accused noticed that she had woken up, he quickly withdrew his hand. She then stared sternly at the accused who said “I’m sorry” twice.

15     V2 maintained that the touch could not have been accidental as the accused’s hand was on her body for a prolonged period and not for less than a second. When it was put to her that the accused had touched her accidentally while making adjustments to his torso due to his back injury, she explained that the accused’s action in the present case could not be characterised as stretching as his fingers were still lingering on her body when she woke up.

16     She then sent a series of text messages (P2) to her boyfriend PW2 at around 7.53am informing him that she had been sexually harassed while she was sleeping. She also informed PW2 that she did not want to sleep on the bus as the incident had happened while she was sleeping. PW2 asked V2 to give him a brief description of the incident to make a police report on her behalf.

17     PW2 proceeded to make a police report P1 on her behalf at 8.22am where he stated that his partner was “sexually harassed” on bus number 161.

## The arrest of the accused

18     The accused was arrested on the morning of 7 August 2018 (the date of the incident in the 2nd charge) at about 8.00 am by Inspector Siti Fatimah and her teammates. On the date of the arrest, a photograph was taken of the accused at 8.47 am which was admitted as P10. Inspector Siti Fatimah took the photo to update SI Quek that the accused had been detained.

19     The caption below P10 stated “Detained. Admit of doing abt 4 times 3 in July…1 today.”

20     Inspector Siti Fatimah explained her caption in P10 as follows[^1]:

> Q    Can you explain why you wrote this caption?

> A    Okay. The word “detained” is to---like I’ve mention earlier, is to update IO Quek that the accused has been detained. And he also told us that he admitted of doing 4 times of touching girls, 3 in July and 1 in August---uh, 1---1 was on the day earlier where he was detained.

> Q    And did the accused mention whether it was accidental or intentional?

> A    He claimed it to be accidental.

21     Inspector Siti Fatimah testified that the accused had told her that he had touched girls accidentally on the bus three times in July 2018.

## Site visit and amendment of 1st charge

22     On 30 March 2021, a site visit was conducted with the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”), defence counsel, the accused and myself present to view the actual bus specified in the 1st charge at Woodlands bus depot. A total of 54 photos (admitted as P13:1-54) were taken by Station Inspector Nur Aisah Bte Azman (“PW7”) of the bus which included a demonstration by the accused of the reach of both his left and right hand from where he sat behind V1.

23     After the site visit, the prosecution amended the 1st charge to state that the accused had “used your hand to touch the left side of her chest, below her armpit near her left breast.” The earlier version of the charge as reflected in the accused’s cautioned statement P14 alleged that the accused was “using your fingers to press hard on the left side of her breast.”

24     The accused claimed trial to the amended charge and neither the prosecution nor the defence sought to recall any witnesses.

## Submission of no case to answer

25     Defence counsel did not make any submission of no case to answer and I was satisfied that the prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case on both charges and the accused was accordingly called to make his defence.

## The accused’s evidence

26     In 2018 the accused had just graduated from the Nanyang Technological Institute with a degree in Electrical Electronics Engineering and was living in the Sengkang area. Towards the end of June 2018 he was working at his brother’s company in Mandai.

### The accused’s evidence with regard to the 1st charge

27     The accused testified that on 6 July 2018 he had taken the bus from Sengkang to Woodlands to work at his brother’s shop at Mandau M-space. He was the first to board the bus and he headed towards the rear end of the bus and sat on the right side (the right side as one faced the front of the bus). He then changed seats as he had a laptop in his bag which was rather heavy and the first seat in which he had sat down on had nothing for him to hold on to prevent him from slipping or when the bus jerked and further the accused had soreness in his lower back lumbar area as a result of a slipped disc which he had sustained from bouldering in 2017.

28     After he sat down behind the victim, he left his left hand between the window side and the chair in front of him. The tip of his finger was holding onto to the plastic cover between the seat cushion and the seat plastic. He testified that that such a seating position allowed him to hold himself in case the bus jerked and he fell forward.

29     On that day, he was quite sleepy as he had insufficient sleep the night before as he was dating his ex girlfriend and he had to fetch her home.

30     During the journey, he was woken up when he felt something sharp brush across his fingers. He looked up and saw V2 staring angrily at him. After a few seconds she sat back in her original position and he was confused not knowing what had happened and he treated it as it nothing happened and he wanted to catch up on his sleep. He then alighted at the next stop.

31     The accused was prepared to accept the possibility that he had touched V1 on her latissimus dorsi (the area on V1’s back and side), but maintained that this had been accidental and this would have been with his left hand and not his right hand. This is because it was impossible for his right hand to have touched her even if it was fully extended given the size of the gap between the seat and the side of the window. His evidence was that he could have touched V1 as a result of the jerking action of the bus which would have caused his left hand to come into contact with her.

### The accused’s evidence with regard to the 2nd charge

32     The accused testified that on 7 August 2018 he had boarded Bus numbers 161 at Sengkang and he went to the upper deck as he was very used to it and preferred the upper deck. He also testified that he sat on the left side of the bus (the left side as one faced the front of the bus) as the sun shone on the right side of the bus and made it hot.

33     He testified that he had chosen to sit beside V2 as there were no empty rows on the left side of the bus. He explained that he preferred to seat in an empty row if possible, but that the bus was always packed and so he could not get an empty row to himself. He claimed that he did not notice the empty row three rows in front of the victim which he had walked past and he did not want to walk further to the empty row at the back of the bus.

34     During the journey, the accused performed a stretch to release pain from his lower back. He stretched his right hand across his chest such that his right hand was at his left shoulder. He then “definitely” touched something which is why he immediately pulled his hand back and looked towards his left which was when he saw V2 staring angrily at him, whereupon he apologised to her afterwards by saying “I’m sorry” and she said “Don’t do it again” and she looked away. He then apologised to her again. He testified that his right arm might have accidentally hit the victim’s right breast with the tip of his right middle finger whilst he was stretching.

35     The accused was prepared to accept that he had touched V2’s upper breast region but maintained that this was an accident, as he was stretching his right hand across his chest to relieve his pain due to his back injury, whereupon he accidentally contacted her breast. He accepted that he had apologized to her but only because he had touched her by accident.

36     On the day of his arrest (the same date as the incident in the 2nd charge) the accused disagreed that he had admitted to Inspector Siti Fatimah on doing it four times and that what had happened was that apart from the incidents on the bus which were accidental, there were two other instances where the ladies had bumped into him in the shopping malls.

### Evidence of Dr Lim Lian Arn

37     Dr Lim Lian Arn (“DW2”) was called as a witness for the defence. DW2 worked in Alpha Joints & Orthopadics at Gleneagles Medical Centre and his field of specialty was orthopaedic surgery. DW2 testified that the accused had been having intermittent lower back pain since 2017. The onset of the pain was a fall from a height as a consequence of bouldering.

38     D1 was a reference letter from Dr Jeremy Koh Wei Mei to Dr Derrick Oh with regard to the accused. DW2 testified that D1 was probably presented to him when the accused consulted him for the first time on 22 July 2020. D2 was the findings of the MRI scan which he had sent the accused for after the consultation. DW2 testified that what the accused had on 22 July 2020 in layman’s terms was a minor slipped disc. From what was stated in D1, this was consistent with a fall in 2017 from bouldering, based on the accused’s reporting and not from a MRI scan as no scan was done in 2018 or prior to the accident in 2017. With no MRI scan done prior to 22 July 2020, DW2 was not able to comment on the condition of the accused’s back in July or August 2018.

39     DW2 testified that the accused did not attend his follow up appointment fixed after 22 July 2020 and the next time he saw the accused was on 2 June 2021 when he attended at Dr Lim’s clinic to ask Dr Lim to testify in the present criminal proceedings.

## The court’s decision

### Principles in evaluating witness testimony

40     In cases of sexual assault, it is often a case of one person’s word against another. In such a scenario, a victim’s evidence should be “unusually convincing” or otherwise corroborated by independent witnesses or other evidence so that it could be relied upon to be the basis of a conviction- see _PP v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”).

41     In _GCK_ the Court of Appeal explained further on what “unusually convincing” meant at \[88\], \[90\] to \[92\]:

> The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is **“so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”**: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that **“a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’**” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]).

> …Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard **entails that the witness’s testimony** **_alone_** **is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt**: see _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[73\].

> \[emphasis added\]

42     That said, this is not a case that turned solely on the victims’ evidence. In the present case, there was extrinsic evidence in the form of CCTV footage, contemporaneous complaints and text messages to other witnesses which corroborated portions of the victims’ account of the incident. The prosecution also tendered the accused’s police statement P11 where the accused had admitted that there was some form of contact with both V1 and V2 albeit unintentional. On the date of his arrest, the accused had admitted to Inspector Siti Fatimah that he had touched the victims but maintained that it was accidental.

43     In assessing the credibility of a witness, in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Arthan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>, Yong CJ held at \[9\] that a judge can make a finding on based on some, or all, of the following factors:

> (a)     The witness’s demeanour;

> (b)     The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence; and

> (c)     The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

### Finding on the 1st charge

44     As the accused was prepared to accept that that he had touched V1 albeit accidentally, the key issue with regard to the 1st charge was whether the touch was accidental or intentional.

45     The defence submitted that V1’s evidence was based on “unfortunate past experiences grown to be a cynical and overcautious individual and these traits have unduly influenced her assessment of the accused's innocence”. Put another way, the defence submitted that V1 had mistakenly thought that the accused intended to touch her when in fact this was accidental and this mistaken assumption was coloured by her past experiences such as having been stalked before. The defence also submitted that V1’s failure to confront the accused thereafter was not consistent with her outraged feelings about being touched by him.

46     V1 had testified that she felt something touching the left side of her chest at the gap between her arm and the left side of her left breast and that the “pressure applied was so hard that \[her\] bra shifted”. She used her right hand to reach across her chest to touch the left side of her breast where she felt the accused’s fingers. V1 stated that the accused’s hand was awkwardly placed in the gap between her seat and the window and that the accused had used his right hand to touch her through the gap between her seat and the window.

47     In respect of V1’s evidence, I make the following observations. First, her evidence was corroborated by CCTV footage P7 which showed that V1 had reached her right hand across her body to the left and turned towards her left[^2]. She then leaned towards her right, turned her head back towards her left and looked back at the accused. While the CCTV footage P7 was not able to capture the accused’s hand touching V1, it still corroborated the victim’s narration of events before, during and after the incident.

48     V1 explained that she did not confront the accused as she did not wish to create a scene. In my view, her reaction of getting up from her seat to stand in the aisle (also confirmed by CCTV footage P7) could not be said to be unreasonable or outside the realm of possible reactions to such an incident. As held by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span> (“_Yue Roger_”), victims of sexual abuse may react in different ways. As such, the fact that V1 did not confront the accused did not make her evidence any less credible.

49     Further, some five minutes after the incident, V1 texted her husband, PW4 informing him about the incident. PW 4 testified that he had received a message from V1 informing him that she was touched on her breast. He then called her and asked her if the touch was accidental or intentional. V1 explained that she had felt the accused’s hand and that it was intentional. PW4 advised V1 to make a police report.

50     V1 proceeded to file a police report (P5) on the same day (6 July 2018) at 2.14pm where she stated as follows:

> I was sexually assaulted.

> I was on my way to work as usual around 8. 15am - 8.20am at Bus 960. This Chinese guy, plump and tail was sitting at the last row of the bus whereas I was at the 2nd last row.

> I only got to know that his fingers were at the left side of my breast area where I felt something was touching me. I felt extremely uncomfortable, I bend forward and look behind I stared at him. His fingers were there between the seat gaps and his eyes were half open. I assume he was pretending to be sleeping. I got off my seat and stand at the passageway. He saw me looking at him and he got off the bus passed by me and alighted at Mandai industrial and as if nothing has happen.

> If you were to trace him, you might like to check with SMRT operation CCTV.

> I assume that I am going to bump into him again and I prayed that this will never happen again or happen to any woman.

51     As to whether the touch could have been accidental, I am of the view that if the touch had been accidental, the accused’s fingers would not have lingered long enough for V1 to grab his fingers to see who and what was touching her. To this end, the accused’s police statement P11 corroborated V1’s evidence to an extent when he stated that he felt her fingers on his finger:

> A2)    ….I fell asleep and **I felt someone running their finger on my finger** but did not see that action. I woke up and saw one female subject who was sitting in front of me staring at me. She then got out of her seat and left her seat.

> \[emphasis added\]

52     Notably, V1’s evidence was that the “pressure applied was so hard that \[her\] bra shifted”. In my view, had the touch been accidental, it was unlikely that the pressure would be so hard as to cause her bra to shift.

53     The defence submitted that the amendment of the charge as the close of the prosecution’s case which was occasioned by the site visit had dented V1’s credibility. In my view, this was not the case as her police report had stated that the touch was “at the left side of my breast area” and the charge in the accused’s cautioned statement P14 alleged that he had “press hard on the left side of her breast from the rear”, which was not inconsistent with the amended charge which stated that he had “touch the left side of her chest, below her armpit near her left breast” or her evidence in court where she said that she felt the touch on the left side of her breast.

54     The defence also submitted that V1’s evidence was that the accused had used his right hand to touch dented her credibility as it would not have been physically possible for the accused to reach and touch her with his right hand. I did not find this observational discrepancy on V1’s part as fatal to her evidence as the defence was prepared to accept that there was contact between the accused’s left hand and V1. In any event, the 1st charge referred to the accused’s hand and did not specify whether it was his left or right hand.

55     Although the accused was prepared in court to concede that he may have accidentally touched V1, I note that in his cautioned statement P14 he simply stated that he was not guilty of the charge, as opposed to stating that he had accidentally touched her as a result of the bus’s jerking motion.

56     Turning to the accused’s evidence, I found his evidence on the changing of his seat contrived in that he claimed that he had changed seats as he needed to find something to hold on to in view of his back injury. Yet he was the first to board the bus where he had the choice of any seat on the bus and could have chosen a seat with a support in front and yet he did not do so and chose to sit behind V1.

57     There was also no mention in his police statement P11 that it was due to his back injury which was the reason why he needed to grab hold of something in front which was the reason why he had changed seats. In the circumstances, I find that the accused has deliberately chosen to sit behind V1.

58     As for the defence’s assertion that the jerking motion of the bus could have caused the accused’s hand to come into contact with V1, having observed the CCTV footage P7, I did not note any discernable jerking of the bus at or immediately before the moment when V1 reached her right hand across her body to the left and turned towards her left, which would have been the moment when the accused touched her.

59     In the circumstances, I found V1’s evidence to be credible and unusually convincing which was corroborated by CCTV footage P7 and supported by her contemporaneous complaint to her husband PW4 and the making of the police report P5 on the same day. I rejected the accused’s evidence that the touch was unintentional as not being credible. On the evidence, I found that the touch on V1 was intentional and I accordingly convicted the accused on the 1st charge.

### Finding on the 2nd charge

60     Given that the defence was prepared to accept that the accused had touched V2’s breast albeit accidentally, the key issue with regard to the 2nd charge was whether the accused’s touch on V2’s breast was intentional on accidental. Key to the accused’s defence was that he was performing a stretch to release pain from his lower back. He stretched his right hand across his chest such that his right hand was at his left shoulder which led to him inadvertently touching V2.

61     The defence submitted that there were inconsistencies in V2’s evidence and further that if V2 was angry or outraged by the accused’s actions, she should have confronted the accused and reported him to the bus captain in order to bring him to justice. Further, the defence countered that V2’s use of the term “sexually harassed” and “boobs” suggested her evidence was unreliable.

62     V2’s evidence was that while she was asleep, she felt pressure on her right breast which caused her to wake up and looked down to see what it was. She then noticed the fingers of the accused’s right hand touching her right breast. Her evidence was that she was touched on the right side of her right breast at an area which was slightly above the nipple area. Once the accused noticed that she had woken up, he quickly withdrew his hand. She then stared sternly at the accused who said “I’m sorry” twice.

63     V2 maintained in cross examination that she saw the accused’s hand still in contact with her body before he withdrew it and apologised to her. She also maintained that the touch could not have been accidental as the accused’s hand was on her body for a prolonged period and not for less than a second.

64     As for her not admonishing the accused in public or reporting him to the bus captain, V2 explained that she was embarrassed about what had happened and did not want to attract any attention and I accepted her explanation as being reasonable in the circumstances and as held in _Yue Roger_, victims of sexual abuse may react in different ways. Further, she did stare at the accused sternly after the incident which prompted him to apologise. In the circumstances, I found V2’s evidence to be clear and consistent.

65     Further, she texted her boyfriend PW2 immediately, describing the incident to him who proceeded to file a police report P1 on her behalf.

66     With regard to the defence contention that V2’s use of the term “sexually harassed” and “boobs” made her evidence less credible, she had explained the context of how she was sexually harassed in her contemporaneous text messages to her boyfriend in P2 where she stated as follows:

> I was like abt to take a nap than I noticed the guy sat beside me when clearly the other side there are still empty seats. At first I thought that was strange but then I just ignore and went to sleep. Soo after I felt someone lightly touching my boobs and when I woke up I saw his hand clearly touch it and he quickly backed out when I woke up. Soon after he said sorry.

67     Further, she explained that the term “boobs” in the messages that she exchanged with her boyfriend was not used in a deliberate manner as that was how she and her boyfriend communicated.

68     As for the accused choosing to sit next to V2 despite there being empty seats on the bus, the accused gave evidence that he had chosen to sit beside V2 as there were no empty rows on the left side of the bus. Yet, the CCTV footage P4 established that there was an empty row of seats three rows in front of the victim which the accused had walked past but he claimed not have noticed this.

69     Further, it was put to V2 by defence counsel that the accused preferred not to sit on the right side of the bus in view of the sun shining on that side[^3]:

> Q    He would choose not to sit on the right because in general the sun would be shining on the right side of the bus.

> A    Okay.

70     Yet, when questioned by the DPP as to whether he preferred to sit on the left side of the bus, the accused answered as follows[^4]:

> Q    But generally, you don’t prefer the left side, is that your evidence?

> A    Generally, left or right does not really matter.

> Q    And you don’t have a habit of sitting on the left side?

> A    No.

> Q    Are you sure?

> A    As in---if what do you mean habit on sitting on left side?

> Q    My question is just generally your preference, do you sit on the left side or right side of the bus when you take the buses?

> A    Sometimes I sit on the left, sometimes I sit on the right, I don’t really go s---consciously think about it.

71     In my view, the accused’s attempt to show that his sitting next to V2 was not a deliberate act but due to his own preference for favouring the left side of the bus because of the sun shining on the right side was internally inconsistent and undermined by his own response to the DPP that he had no preference of sitting on the left or right side of the bus. Further, there was in fact an empty row of sears three rows in front of V2 as well as vacant aisle seats on the right side of the bus but the accused chose to sit next to V2. In the circumstances, I find that the accused has deliberately chosen to sit next to V2.

72     As for the accused’s explanation in court that the touch to V2 occurred when he was stretching his right hand across his chest, in his police statement P11 he stated as follows:

> A5)    …. I twisted my body to the left and stretched my right arm. **I bumped my left arm onto her right waist**. She startled and I apologise to her immediately and shifted away from her.

> \[emphasis added\]

73     In his further police statement P15 the accused stated as follows:

> After I was seated, I felt sleepy and dozed off for a while. Halfway through the sleep, I felt my leg being numb and my back aching. I decided to stretch my right arm by twisting my arm inwards towards my body. My left arm was holding on to my bag pack. **While stretching my right arm, my left arm accidentally hit the lady on her right thigh area. It was a bump against her thigh area.** I suddenly heard a gaping \[sic\] sound which sounded like a shock sound. I immediately turned and saw the lady beside me looking shocked. I apologised to her a few times and moved further away from her to leave more space between the both of us. I was shocked as the lady looked unhappy told me: "Don't do it again". I decided to alight at the bus stop one stop before Woodlands Interchange.

> \[emphasis added\]

74     Further, in P15 the accused stated as follows:

> Q1:    Did you touch the lady’s breast?

> A1:    No, however, it is also possible that **I may have accidentally brush against the lady’s breast area** while I am stretching my right arm.

> \[emphasis added\]

75     In his cautioned statement P 16 to the 2nd charge, he stated as follows:

> I may have accidentally touched her but **definitely not where she claimed.**

> \[emphasis added\]

76     The defence conceded that there were inconsistencies between the accused’s police statements and his evidence in court but submitted these were not material and did not affect the crux of the defence. I disagree. I find that the accused’s version of his contact with V2 in his police and cautioned statements were materially inconsistent with one another as well as with his evidence in court. The accused had traversed different and distinct parts of V2’s anatomy which he said he had contact with ranging from her waist to her thigh and eventually her breast. In my view, these inconsistencies were material as it went to the heart of the accused’s credibility in an attempt to distance himself from admitting that he had touched V2’s breast. There was also no reference in his cautioned statement to his back injury as being the cause of his stretching which suggested to me that this was an afterthought. In my view, the accused was not credible on account of the shifting versions between his evidence in court and his police statements.

77     D3 was a note from Singhealth Polyclinics at Sengkang which stated that the accused visited the Sengkang Polyclinic on 27 July 2018 on account of his chronic lower back pain occasioned by a fall in November 2017. An X-ray of his lumbar spine was done which showed no obvious fractures and incidental findings of mild scoliosis with concavity to the left was noted.

78     As for DW2’s evidence as to the accused’s medical condition, DW2 conceded that he could not comment on the condition of the accused’s back during the period of July to August 2018 (the period when the offences were said to have been committed), as the MRI scan report D2 only reflected the condition of the accused’s back almost two years later, on 22 July 2020. DW2 also explained that the accused did not attend his follow up appointment fixed after 22 July 2020 and the next time he saw the accused was on 2 June 2021 when he attended at DW2’s clinic to ask DW2 to testify on his behalf in the present criminal proceedings.

79     Given that DW2 was unable to comment on the accused’s back condition at the time of the offences as stated in the 2nd charge, I find that DW2’s evidence did not support the defence’s assertion that the touching of V2 was accidental. Further, there was no reference in the accused’s police statement P11 that it was his back injury which caused him to stretch his right arm which led to him touching V2 even if there was some reference to his leg being numb and his back aching in his further police statement P15.

80     In the circumstances, I accepted V2’s evidence as being clear, consistent and unusually convincing and rejected the accused’s evidence as not being credible. On the evidence, I found that the accused’s touch on V2’s right breast was intentional and not accidental and I accordingly convicted him on the 2nd charge.

## Other issues- missing CCTV footage

81     Defence counsel invited me to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for the non production of video clips which had been lost when SI Quek’s laptop crashed.

82     The lost CCTV footage related to the accused sitting down and changing seats to sit next to V1 as well as the accused leaving the bus. As the accused did not dispute that he had changed seats nor was the issue of him leaving the bus a contentious issue, I was of the view that the loss of this CCTV footage did not prejudice the defence and I accordingly declined to make any adverse inference against the prosecution in this regard. More critically, the moment when there was contact between the accused and V1 was available as evidence.

## Antecedents

83     The accused is untraced.

## Sentence

### The prosecution’s submission on sentence

84     In respect of the 1st charge, the prosecution highlighted the following:

> (a)     The accused had touched an area near the victim’s private parts over her clothing. He had used sufficient pressure such that the victim’s bra had shifted.

> (b)     The present offence took place on board a public transport vehicle. In _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundaram v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”), Chan J observed (at \[58\]) “the growing need for the courts to deter offenders from committing outrage of modesty cases on public transport has been highlighted on multiple occasions in Parliament”.

> (c)     There was a degree of premeditation involved as the accused had changed his seat such that he was sitting directly behind V1.

85     The prosecution submitted that the indicative starting point for this offence should be one month’s imprisonment.

86     In respect of the 2nd charge the prosecution submitted that this charge fell within Band 2 of _Kunasekaran_ for the following reasons:

> (a)     The accused had intruded upon the V2’s private parts (her breast) albeit over her clothing.

> (b)     The offence took place on board a public transport vehicle.

> (c)     The accused took advantage of the V2’s vulnerability as she was asleep.

87     The prosecution submitted that the indicative starting point for this offence should be five months’ imprisonment.

88     In _Kunasekaran_, Chan Seng Onn J adopted for use in s 354(1) Penal Code cases See Kee Oon J’s two-step sentencing framework for s 354(2) Penal Code cases in _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span>.

89     First, the court would consider the following offence specific factors:

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation which includes considerations of the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty;

> (b)     the circumstances of the offence which include considerations of: (i) the presence of premeditation; (ii) the use of force or violence; (iii) the abuse of a position of trust; (iv) the use of deception; (v) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (vi) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim; and

> (c)     the harm caused to the victim which could be physical or psychological.

90     The prosecution relied on the following two reported precedents:

91     The prosecution submitted that both sentences should run consecutively as the Court of Appeal in _Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 647</span> (“_Sutarno_”) held that distinct offences should be punished separately with consecutive sentences, otherwise “the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would result in the perverse and unjust outcome of the offender not having to bear any real consequences for the further offending” (at \[22\]). Specifically, the first and fourth reasons for the general rule in _Raveen_ are apposite in the present case: that “unrelated offences should attract their own distinct consequences” (at \[42\]) and allowing a multiple offender to not be punished at all for further offending would be a “perverse outcome that flies in the face of any notion of justice” (at \[46\]).

### Mitigation

92     The accused was 29 years old and was single. He had a 33-year-old brother who was working in the finance industry and serving a period of incarceration for a traffic offence. His mother was 58 years old and was working in the Singapore General Hospital as a service staff handling food and beverage. She suffered from chronic leg pain and had low mobility. Recently she had a fall and fractured her left little finger and was still recovering. She has since stopped working. His father was 59 years old and was working as a subcontractor in the construction industry.

93     The accused attained a degree in Electrical Electronic Engineering from the Nanyang Technological University. He completed National Service with the Singapore Armed Forces from 2014 to 2016. He was in the Armoured Infantry and held the rank of Lance Corporal. He had recently managed to secure employment at Ion Beam Applications Singapore Pte Ltd as a service engineer. He currently resided with his family.

94     In respect of the 1st charge, defence counsel highlighted that the touch on V1 had been fleeting and over her clothing and not on her private part. No violence was used, there was an absence of any kind of abuse of trust and there was no great deal of sophistication involved in the conception and execution of the offence. Defence counsel submitted that the custodial threshold has not been crossed and submitted for a fine to be imposed.

95     In respect of the 2nd charge, defence counsel submitted the same points as with the first charge but conceded that the custodial threshold has been crossed as V2’s private part (her breast) was touched. However, in the light of mitigating circumstances, defence counsel urged the court to impose four months' imprisonment.

96     The defence submitted for a global sentence of four months’ imprisonment and an approprate fine.

### The court’s decision on sentence

97     As stated in _Kunasekaran_, based on the consideration of the foregoing offence-specific factors, the court should ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place the offence within any of the following three bands of imprisonment:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.6162767446511%"> <col width="27.3345330933813%"> <col width="54.0491901619676%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing Range</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Factors</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 5 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases at the lowest end of the spectrum, which do not present any (or at most one) offence-specific factors.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases where two or more offence-specific factors are present.

### Sentence for the 1st charge

98     The following were the offence specific factors in respect of the first charge:

> (a)     The accused had touched an area near V1’s left breast over her clothing with sufficient pressure such that the victim’s bra had shifted.

> (b)     There was a degree of premeditation involved as the accused had changed his seat such that he was sitting directly behind V1.

> (c)     The present offence took place on board a public transport vehicle.

99     In the circumstances, I placed the offence in lower end of the middle band of Band 1 in terms of the _Kunasekaran_ framework with a starting point of one month’s imprisonment.

100    I did not agree with the defence that a fine was warranted (which would have placed it at the lowest end of Band 1) given the offence specific factors that I have highlighted above.

101    Moving to the second step on aggravating and mitigating factors, I did not find any aggravating or mitigating factors and I accordingly imposed a sentence of one month’s imprisonment.

### Sentence for the 2nd charge

102    I agreed with the prosecution that the offence fell within Band 2 in view of the following offence specific factors:

> (a)     The accused had intruded upon V2’s private parts (her breast) albeit over her clothing.

> (b)     The offence took place on board a public transport vehicle.

> (c)     The accused took advantage of V2’s vulnerability whilst she was asleep.

103    The prosecution submitted that the indicative starting point for this offence would be five months’ imprisonment. The defence’s submission was not far off, seeking a sentence of four month’s imprisonment.

104    Given that the touch on the victim’s breast was relatively brief and over her clothing, I would place this case at the lower end of Band 2 with a starting point of five months’ imprisonment.

105    Moving to the second step on aggravating and mitigating factors, I did not find any aggravating or mitigating factors and I impose a sentence of five month’s imprisonment on the accused.

106    I would add that a sentence of five month’s imprisonment was consistent with the case precedents cited by the prosecution in _Kochadai Baskaran_ and _Ramakrishnan Anbu_ which were offences committed on public transport and involved a relatively brief touch of the victims’ breast over clothing resulting in sentence of four month’s imprisonment imposed in each case. That said, the court in those cases had been given a sentencing discount as the offenders had pleaded guilty.

### Consecutive sentences

107    In _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> Menon CJ observed at \[41\] that

> As a general rule, a multiple offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.

108    On what amounts to an “unrelated offence”, Menon CJ observed at \[69\] that

> ...to say that two offences are “unrelated” means that they are _not_ “part of a single transaction”; conversely, to describe them as “part of a single transaction” means they are _not_ “unrelated”. The two inquiries are two sides of the same coin.

109    As both charges involved offences committed against different victims on separate days, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that both sentences should be consecutive, otherwise “the imposition of concurrent sentences for unrelated offences would result in the perverse and unjust outcome of the offender not having to bear any real consequences for the further offending” (per “_Sutarno_” at \[22\]). The sentences of five months’ imprisonment and one month’s imprisonment would accordingly run consecutively.

110    The global sentence which I imposed was six month’s imprisonment.

111    The accused is on bail pending appeal.
