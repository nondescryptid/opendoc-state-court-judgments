Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Young offenders – Cheating – Whether probation or reformative training is the most appropriate sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9760/2020/01.\]

17 September 2020

### Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused. The Accused had pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code. He also agreed to one charge of cheating under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code to be taken into consideration for the purpose of his sentence. I called for pre-sentence reports of both probation and reformative training (RT). He was assessed to be unsuitable for probation but suitable for RT.

2       I ordered the Accused to undergo RT for a period of six months as recommended. However, being dissatisfied with the sentence, the Accused had filed a notice of appeal against the sentence and applied for a stay of the execution of the RT which was granted.

3       I now give the grounds for my decision.

## The charge

4       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> _DAC 914489/2019_

> _“that you, between February 2019 and April 2019, in Singapore, did engage in a conspiracy with Chua Wei Beng, Kenneth Ho Hong Wei and other persons, in order to cheat GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd (“_ **_Grab_** _”), and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, you deceived Grab into believing that a total number of 1758 GrabHitch rides had been booked via the “Grab” mobile application and completed, facts which you knew to be false, and by such manner of deception, you dishonestly induced Grab to deliver an amount of SGD 26,115.50 to you and Chua, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed)”;_

5       The Accused also admitted and consented to have the following charge of cheating under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence:

> _DAC 919955/2019_

> _“that you, between February 2019 and April 2019, in Singapore, did engage in a conspiracy with Chua Wei Beng, Kenneth Ho Hong Wei and other persons, in order to cheat GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd (“_ **_Grab_** _”), and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place, to wit, you deceived Grab into believing that a total number of 563 GrabHitch rides had been booked via the “Grab” mobile application and completed, facts which you knew to be false, in order to dishonestly induce Grab to deliver an amount of SGD 12,577.20 to you and Chua, which offence was not committed in consequence of the abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 420 read with Section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”_

**The Statement of Facts**.

6       The Statement of Facts relating to the proceeded charge, which the Accused admitted to without any qualification, are summarised below :

> 1.     _The first accused person is_ **_Ryan Wong Wei Zhi_** _(the “_ **_Accused_** _”), a 20-year-old male Singaporean. He was serving his National Service with the Singapore Armed Forces at the time of the offences._

> 2.     _The second accused person is_ **_Chua Wei Beng_** _(“_ **_Chua_** _”), a 22-year-old male Singaporean. He is the childhood friend of the Accused and was serving his National Service at the time of the offences_.

> 3.     _The third accused person is_ **_Kenneth Ho Hong Wei_** _(“_ **_Ho_** _”), a 23-year-old male Singaporean. He was also serving his National Service at the material time. Chua befriended him while they were both stationed at Selarang Camp._

> 4.     _The Victim is GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd (“_ **_Grab_** _”). Grab is in the business of offering inter alia ride-hailing services through a mobile application (the “_ **_Grab App_** _”). One of these services is “GrabHitch”, which allows riders to book a ride with private car drivers. The Grab App also allows riders to make payment using a debit card._

> 5.     _In or around January 2019, the Accused set out to deceive Grab into paying out monies for GrabHitch rides that were never made or paid for._

> 6.     _The Accused realised that he could book a GrabHitch ride on a rider’s account using a debit card linked to an empty bank account. Thereafter, he could accept the same booking using a driver’s account and register the “pick-up” and “drop-off” on the Grab App without actually making the trip. On that basis, Grab would be induced to pay out the earnings from the fraudulent ride to the “driver” who accepted the booking. Grab would then charge the cost of the ride to the debit card provided by the “rider”. However, Grab would receive no payment, as the bank account linked to the debit card had no funds to begin with._

> 7.     _As the man behind both the “rider” and “driver”, the Accused stood to reap the earnings of the ride accruing to the driver’s account, without having to pay for the ride itself. Grab would be none the wiser._

> 8.     _On 17 April 2019, Ong Chien Ting, an Operations Research Analyst of Grab, made a police report (the “_ **_Report_** _”) informing that “GrabHitch Passengers created fake rides and GrabHitch drivers completed them without actually driving. These rides are being charged to cards which are declined and drivers are paid anyway.”_

> 9.     _The Report also named 13 persons alleged to be the said “GrabHitch drivers”, including Chua and Ho. Investigations revealed that 4 additional persons were involved in the scheme to cheat Grab, including the Accused and his girlfriend, Soh Jing Ting (“_ **_Soh_** _”)._

> 10.     _Sometime in early February 2019, the Accused invited Chua to assist with his scheme to cheat Grab. Chua agreed and offered his driver’s account on the Grab App for use. They also agreed to split their profits equally._

> 11.     _For the next few weeks, the Accused and Chua met every Friday of the week to book fraudulent GrabHitch rides on the next 6 days. They would book 2 rides per day of the week excluding Fridays (i.e. 12 rides in total) using the rider’s accounts of Chua and the Accused, as well as 2 additional rider’s accounts created using the pre-paid SIM cards that Chua purchased._

> 12.     _Each booking was made using a debit card linked to the Accused’s bank account, which contained no funds at the material time._

> 13.     _Chua accepted all bookings using his driver’s account. He then registered the “pickup” and “drop-off” for all rides without having fulfilled them._

> 14.     _The Accused and Chua soon realised that what they were doing was not profitable. Each GrabHitch driver could only make up to_ _2 trips_ _and earn a maximum of S$144 in fares per day. To maximise their earnings, the Accused and Chua knew that they would need more rider’s accounts and driver’s accounts at their disposal._

> 15.     _Sometime in late February 2019, Chua invited Ho to participate in their plan to cheat Grab. Ho was to recruit additional participants and manage the administrative aspects of the scheme. In return, Ho would receive remuneration of around S$300 per week. Ho agreed._

> 16.     _Sometime in March 2019, the Accused called his friend, Desmond Tan Si Liang (“_ **_Desmond_** _”), and informed him of an opportunity to earn fast cash by scamming Grab. When they met, the Accused created a driver’s account on the Grab App in Desmond’s name. He promised Desmond S$300 to S$500 per week in exchange for use and control of the said account. He also told Desmond that he would pay S$50 in commission if Desmond introduced other persons to the scam._

> 17.     _The Accused also recruited Soh into the scheme. He told her to operate a driver’s account on the Grab App and accept fraudulent GrabHitch bookings. In return, she would receive around S$200 per week. Soh agreed to provide her assistance._

> 18.     _By April 2019, a total of 14 persons had been recruited by Chua, Ho and the Accused into the scheme. They were typically promised commissions ranging from S$300 to S$400 per week._

> 19.     _In or around March 2019, the Accused obtained 3 new pre-paid SIM cards and 1 postpaid SIM card to create new rider’s accounts on the Grab App._

> 20.     _In total, the Accused and Chua had 24 rider’s accounts and 13 driver’s accounts on the Grab App at their disposal. The Accused and Chua controlled_ _all rider’s accounts_ _as well as_ _8 driver’s accounts_ _. The remaining driver’s accounts were operated by other participants of the scheme, including Ho._

> 21.     _Ho was not involved in the operation of rider’s accounts. However, Ho had designed personalised schedules stating the dates and times on which fraudulent ride bookings were to be accepted by the “drivers”._

> 22.     _Between March 2019 and April 2019, the Accused and Chua made a total of_ **_2,321 fraudulent ride bookings_** _. All rides were booked under the names of 7 fictitious passengers and for the same routes (i.e. from a place named “Daelim” to a place named “Nicoll Drive”, and vice versa)._

> 23.     _Further, all rides were booked using 5 debit cards linked to the Accused’s bank accounts, which had insufficient funds at all material times. The Accused had applied for the 5 debit cards to spread out the fraudulent bookings and avoid detection._

> 24.     _The fraudulent bookings were thereafter accepted by the “drivers”. They would register the “pick-up” and “drop-off” on their driver’s accounts within the time designated by Ho’s schedules. In truth, however, no rides were made, and no passengers were picked up._

> 25.     _Of the 2,321 fraudulent bookings made by the Accused and Chua, Grab was deceived into believing that 1,758 ride bookings were genuine. On that basis, Grab paid out to the Accused and Chua a total sum of_ **_S$26,115.50_** _representing the fares (less 10% platform fees) accruing to the “drivers”._

> 26.     _Grab also charged the cost of all rides to the Accused’s 5 debit cards but received no payment at all._

> 27.     _To date, Chua has paid Ho a sum of S$300 for his assistance. Chua also paid S$900 and S$1,000 respectively to 2 participants of the scheme. The remaining sum of_ _S$23,915.50_ _was shared equally between Chua and the Accused._

> 28.     _On or around 30 March 2019, Grab discovered that fraudulent GrabHitch rides had been booked on its Grab App. Grab proceeded to deactivate the 13 driver’s accounts referred to at paragraph 9._

> 29.     _In light of the above, the Accused has committed an offence under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

> 30.     _Sometime in May 2019, while investigations were ongoing, Chua, Ho and the Accused met at a bar in East Coast to discuss if they could execute a similar scheme on the Gojek mobile application. This was put to an end when the three were brought in a few days later by police officers of the Commercial Affairs Department for questioning._

> 31.     _The Accused has not made any restitution to Grab. He is traced._

## Antecedents

7       On 9 October 2018 the Accused was convicted on 10 offences relating to Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) and Motor Vehicles (Third-Party risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) where he was sentenced to a total fine of $6500 and a Disqualification Order was also imposed upon him from holding and obtaining driving licence for a period of 12 months.

## Prosecution’s submission on sentence

8       The Prosecution submitted that while rehabilitation was relevant given the Accused’s age, deterrence was also relevant on the application of factors in **_PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari_** <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 187</span> at \[82\] to \[86\]. There was a high degree of planning and premeditation as the Accused had masterminded an elaborate scheme involving 14 other participants to cheat Grab. He had thought of using multiple debit cards and SIM cards to avoid detection. Further, s. 420 PC is a serious offence which is punishable with a mandatory custodial sentence and he would have been incarcerated if not for his age.

9       The Prosecution urged the Court to sentence the Accused to RT as recommended in the RT Report. The Probation Report did not find the Accused suitable for probation as there was no family member able to maintain the requisite degree of supervision. The Prosecution submitted that great weight should ordinarily be accorded to the Probation Officer’s recommendations: **_A Karthik v PP_** <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 202</span> at \[78\] and hence probation would not be suitable for the Accused.

## Mitigation

10     The Defence Counsel submitted that Accused had co-operated fully with the police leading to the disclosure of the matters in the statement of facts. It started off as an idle thought which became a reality when he realised the vulnerabilities of the Grab pay system. His family was in financial difficulties and the thought of reaping the financial gains to help his family led him to commit the offences. His share of profits was about $7,000 to $8,000.00 and he spent most of it towards the family and household expenses.

11     The Defence Counsel did not challenge the Probation Report but maintained that although the offence is serious, it is not so egregious as to displace rehabilitation as the dominant consideration in sentencing as the Accused is still young and capable of reform.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

### Sentencing Considerations for Young Offenders

12     The sentencing court would generally consider the sentencing of a young offender in a 2-stage approach ((see _PP v A Karthik_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 202</span> (“_A Karthik_”) at \[64\], citing _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“_Boaz Koh_”) at \[28\]):

> (i)     the first stage is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence; and

> (ii)     the second stage is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.

13     As a starting point, the dominant sentencing consideration for young offenders below the age of 21 is that of rehabilitation. On the facts, although the nature of the offence is serious but bearing in mind the age of the Accused at the time of the offence, I did not rule out rehabilitation as the primary sentencing consideration at the first stage of the inquiry.

14     At the second stage of the inquiry, the main issue of contention is whether probation or reformative training, would be the most appropriate sentence. It was held at \[67\] of _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> that, at this second stage of the approach: “the court must select the appropriate sentence in view of the primary sentencing considerations identified and prioritised at the first stage. Where rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration, probation would be one of the typical options at the court’s disposal, given that probation places rehabilitation at the front and centre of the court’s deliberation: _Boaz Koh_ at \[35\]; see also \[33\] above. In contrast, **where there is a need for both deterrence and rehabilitation**, _(emphasis added)_ reformative training may be the most suitable sentence, given that it offers the court a useful middle ground between sending the offender to prison and meeting the desire to rehabilitate a young offender: _Boaz Koh_ at \[38\]–\[39\] and _Al-Ansari_ at \[57\]–\[58\].”

15     In determining whether probation or reformative training would be the most appropriate sentence given the circumstances of this case, I found that general and specific deterrence were equally important considerations when sentencing the Accused.

16     I agree with the Prosecution that the nature of the offence committed by the Accused is serious. This is not a simple one-off type of cheating offence committed by the Accused. Over a period of four months from January 2019 to April 2019, the Accused meticulously planned and recruited 14 other members in a complex scheme to cheat Grab. As the mastermind of the entire scam, there was careful planning on his part to escape any detection by Grab through the participation of many others to join his scheme to make it appear that all the numerous transactions were genuine.

17     The financial loss of more than twenty-six thousand dollars caused to Grab was substantial and Accused had not been able to make any restitution to the victim.

18     Without the initiation of the elaborate scheme by the Accused, the other co-Accused persons would not have been implicated. There is clear need for both general and specific deterrence to discourage likeminded individuals as well as the Accused himself from committing such acts again.

19     I accepted the Probation Officer’s assessment that probation would not be a suitable option for the Accused based on the main risk factors identified in her report namely: the Accused’s lack of commitment to make changes; his endorsement of anti-social means to obtain his needs; his propensity to risky behaviours and habits like late nights, gang involvement and illegal gambling; his lack of motivation, responsibility and accountability towards his National Service commitments and his father’s inability to provide effective supervision over him.

20     The RT report found him to be physically and mentally fit to undergo RT at Level 1 intensity of rehabilitation of 6 months. He will undergo a series of interventions that will target his motivation to change, his relationship with his family, and employment.

## Conclusion

21     Where the nature of the offence committed is serious and there is a need to consider general and specific deterrence, reformative training provides the useful option of striking a balance between deterrence and rehabilitation for youthful offenders.

22     In the present case, as probation is not a viable option for the Accused, I found that the rehabilitative regime afforded by the RT would be an appropriate sentence for the Accused.
