### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

## Introduction:

Mr Anthony Fok and Mr Edmund Quek are the main parties in this case, and at the material time, both were in the business of providing private tuition for students taking A Level economics. They each operated tuition centres of their own, and also issued publications for students on that subject. Both achieved a measure of success. Though they were personally unacquainted with each other, Edmund nonetheless started making various public statements about Anthony’s qualifications and abilities as an economics tutor. This subsequently extended to the nature and quality of Anthony’s publications. Edmund persisted with those claims even after Anthony issued legal demand to cease and desist. Anthony then brought this suit against Edmund for defamation and malicious falsehood. The trial was fixed before me. Having objectively reviewed the evidence about Edmund’s actions, I found Anthony’s claim amply proven, and Edmund’s defences evidentially unsupported. Judgment was accordingly entered in favour of the plaintiffs, and damages totaling $170,000/- were awarded. These are the grounds for my decision.

## Background to the Parties:

2        **Anthony Fok Kah Hon (“Anthony”)**: Anthony’s tuition centre was located at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre. Started in 2012, the tuition centre was ultimately registered as **JC Economics Education Centre Pte Ltd** (“**JCE**”[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)), and Anthony remained the sole tutor at JCE.[^2] Anthony also issued various texts and assessment books for students on the subject, and these were published through **Curriculum Planning and Development (Singapore) Pte Ltd** (“**CPD**”). Those books were available for purchase at the retailer Popular Bookstore. CPD also handled the distribution of publications by other authors.[^3] Anthony was the sole director and shareholder of both JCE and CPD. By 2015, Anthony had tutored hundreds of students on the subject, and he came to be recorded in the Singapore Book of Records for being the ‘Highest Earning Economics Tutor in 2015’.[^4] Press coverage about his tutoring also increased. Over the period 2015-2018, various media articles about tuition appeared in the New Paper, Straits Times, CNBC, and BBC, and they all featured Anthony and referred to him as a “_Super Tutor_” primarily on account of the million-dollar annual revenues earned due to the high demand for his services.[^5]

3        **Edmund Quek Ban Tong (“Edmund”)**: Edmund’s tuition centre was located at Block 505B Bishan Street 11. Started in 2011, Edmund’s tuition centre was registered as **Economics Cafe Learning Centre** (“**EC**”) – a partnership business which Edmund held with his wife: Linda Geng Yan (“**Linda**”). Edmund also issued texts and assessment books for students on the subject; these were also available for purchase at Popular Bookstore. Edmund enjoyed a good demand for his services, and was listed as the ‘Principal Tutor’ at EC, and described on EC’s website as “_arguably the best economics tutor in Singapore_”.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

## Background to the Words Published & Spoken, and the Defences claimed:

4       Though Anthony and Edmund were in the same industry targeting the same segment, their paths never crossed, and they did not have cause to interact directly.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) This did not however stop Edmund from making various public claims and statements specifically about Anthony in 2017.

### \- The 2017 Website Posts:

5       On 26 April 2017, Edmund publicly published a post on EC’s website. Edmund titled the post “**_Who Is The Best Economics Tutor In Singapore?_**” and used his wife’s name as the purported author of that post. Part of that post made reference to Anthony and is recited below:

> _“… Many students and parents believe that the best economics tutor is the economics tutor who has the greatest publicity. This is a very serious misconception. For example, the media exposure of economics tutor Anthony Fok is far greater than that of all the economics tutors in Singapore combined. However, the reason for his great media exposure is the vast amount of time and money he spends on marketing rather than his track record in teaching. A quick check on Google Search will reveal the incredibly large number of websites Anthony Fok has created for his expensive marketing effort. Indeed, one will also find out that Anthony Fok does not even have an internal degree in economics which some may find it hard to believe. Every economics tutor has a finite amount of time. Therefore, when more of their time is spent on marketing, it means that less of their time is spent on helping students. …”__[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)_

6       A few months later, on 5 October 2017, Edmund publicly published another post titled “**_How Does One Be A Good Economics Tutor?_**” on EC’s website using the pen-name “Mark Chua” as the purported author of that post.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) Part of that post again made reference to Anthony, and is recited below:

> _“… An economics tutor without a university degree in economics is likely to have limited knowledge of the subject and therefore is likely to be ineffective in helping students excel in the examination. For example, the so-called super tutor Anthony Fok did not have a university degree in economics but was providing JC economics tuition. As a result, many of his students fared poorly in the examination, although he was able to get a large number of students initially through his high expenditure on marketing. …”_

7       When these two 2017 website posts were published (hereinafter referred to as the “**2017 website posts**”), neither were personally acquainted with the other, nor had they even interacted directly. That remained the case even after those two website posts were published.

### \- The January 2019 Incidents:

8       The situation however changed in January 2019 when Edmund found out from others that Anthony had acquired a position which afforded possible influence over the distribution of one of his publications. That publication was then being distributed by MarketAsia Books Pte Ltd (“**MarketAsia**”), and Edmund was worried about the distribution of his book after learning that Anthony had bought over MarketAsia. On 11 January 2019, Edmund called up one Christopher Yaw Yan Gan (“**Christopher**”) to register his feelings about that situation; Christopher was then one of the directors at MarketAsia. Even though Christopher explained that Anthony was never involved in the distribution of Edmund’s publication, and that Anthony also no longer owned MarketAsia, Edmund was not placated. In fact, Edmund proceeded to immediately terminate his distributorship agreement with MarketAsia. After the call, Christopher informed Anthony about what happened. Anthony then decided to call Edmund directly to address the situation. It was in that context that the two then came to speak directly over the phone.

9       In total, the two of them had three direct telephone conversations during that period. The content and outcome of those conversations was a matter of central dispute before me. Edmund alleged that, amongst the matters discussed, Anthony voluntarily admitted during the second phone call to making the “_grave mistake of asking his students to write some of his Textbooks and requested for some time … for the current copies of the said Textbooks which were then displayed for sale in bookstores in Singapore to be sold out and he would thereafter revise the contents of the Textbooks_” (“**the alleged admission**”).[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) On that basis, Edmund then embarked on a righteous crusade out of a perceived social and moral duty to tell all and sundry.[^11]

10     A few days after the alleged admission, Edmund started by calling the manager, one Ms Esther Lim (“**Esther**”) at Popular Bookstore on 14 January 2019 to report that some of Anthony’s publications were actually written by Anthony’s students.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) Popular Bookstore took some actions in response to that report, and a meeting was arranged on 16 January 2019 with one Ken Tan (“**Ken**”), who was the manager at CPD to address the matter. Out of the 20 titles from Anthony, Popular Bookstore ultimately decided to retain 6 titles for sale – those coincided with the titles which were the most saleable at Popular Bookstore. Edmund was then informed by Esther of that outcome. Several months later, Edmund revived the issue and widened the circle by repeating the alleged admission together with a slew of other allegations of connected admissions by Anthony in an email dated 7 September 2019 sent from EC to: (1) the members at the Association of Tutors (Singapore) – which incidentally was set up by Anthony with nine other tutors[^13], (2) to various local schools, and (3) to various local teachers (the text of that email is set out at **Annex A** to these Grounds).[^14] A similar email repeating those allegations was also sent again to Popular Bookstore on 8 September 2019 (**Annex B**).[^15] Finally, those allegations were also broadcast publicly to the world at large on the Facebook page of EC on the 9 September 2019, so as to, amongst others, “_strongly advise students who have possession of the books to discontinue using them_” (**Annex C**).[^16]

### \- Events Preceding the Suit, and the Defences claimed:

11     Those various actions by Edmund to broadcast the alleged admission soon came to the attention of Anthony. Through legal counsel, Anthony then issued legal demand to Edmund on 10 September 2019 to cease, desist, apologise, and compensate for the defamation involving the alleged admission.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) In response, Edmund instead published a revised version of that public Facebook post on 11 September 2019 maintaining the alleged admission (**Annex D**).[^18] In gist, Edmund’s revisions involved the addition of some factual claims about verifications done to confirm the truth of the alleged admission. Several days later, Edmund also made arrangements for a further revised version of that post to become a Sponsored Post on Facebook so as to boost its public circulation even further (**Annex E**).[^19] In gist, Edmund’s revisions in that Sponsored Post involved the addition of statements alluding to Anthony’s lack of university credentials and how that made it especially important for the alleged admission to be publicly reported. Given Edmund’s escalation, Anthony then prepared to file suit, and his getting up resulted in the realization that Edmund had made public statements about him as early as 2017 in the two website posts on EC’s website.[^20] The present suit seeking relief for (1) those two 2017 website posts, and (2) the utterance, emails & Facebook posts of 2019, was filed a few weeks later.

12     In this suit, Anthony stood as the 1st plaintiff, JCE as the 2nd plaintiff, and CPD as the 3rd plaintiff. They claimed that Edmund (the 1st defendant) and EC (the 2nd defendant), had injured them by the words published and spoken, and sought damages – the cause of action was in the tort of defamation and malicious falsehood. The defendants claimed a layered defence: first denying that the words were capable of a defamatory meaning, then alternatively justifying them to be true in substance and in fact. A claim of fair comment was also made, together with a claim of qualified privilege. Malice was also denied.

13     The chronology of background facts recounted thus far were beyond dispute.

## Issues:

14     From the chronology recounted, it would be apparent that the allegedly tortious actions of the defendants fell into two periods which were distinct in terms of their content and their occasion:

> ■    The two 2017 website posts by the defendants regarding Anthony’s acclaim, credentials & abilities as a tutor; and,

> ■    The 2019 utterance, emails and Facebook posts by the defendants alluding to the alleged admission involving students having authored Anthony’s publications.

The observation being made here is that the factual context indicated that those two categories were capable of, and ought to be independently analysed for their potential liability in tort. That approach was taken. One further observation deserves mention at this point: whilst a potential failure to prove a defamatory meaning on one did not necessarily affect the claim on the other, the same was not necessarily the case where a defamatory meaning was proven – in that latter scenario, the defamatory meaning established on one may serve to bolster the case on the other.

15     Given the context, the broad primary issues which had to be resolved in this case were thus as follows (set out in their chronologically sequential order):

> I.     Whether the 2017 website posts were defamatory? And if so, whether any of the claimed defences applied?

> II.     Whether the 2019 utterance, emails and Facebook posts were defamatory? And if so, whether any of the claimed defences applied?

> III.     Whether the tort of malicious falsehood was also established?

> IV.     If tortious liability was established, what would be the proper quantum of damages which ought to be awarded?

16     The decision to set out and address the issues in a chronologically sequential order was mine. That sequence was not adopted by the parties in their pleadings and submissions where a reversed sequence was set out instead, i.e. they dealt with the 2019 events first before returning to 2017. I found that reversed sequence not immediately intuitive. In my judgment, a review based upon findings made in a chronologically sequential order still affords the best route to arriving at a more accurate assessment as to what was happening at each point of time. Next, in terms of witnesses, apart from Anthony and Edmund, the plaintiffs called Christopher and Ken to testify, and the defendants called Esther to testify. I now turn to address my findings on the evidence in each of the issues.

## I.   Whether the 2017 website posts were defamatory?

17     The law of defamation is well settled that an objective standard is used to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of words claimed to be defamatory. The court determines what meaning the words convey to an ordinary reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal, using his general knowledge and common sense, and this may include inferences or implications which the said ordinary reasonable person may draw from those words in the light of his general knowledge, common sense and experience after reading the publication as a whole and noting the circumstances and manner of its publication. The party’s subjective interpretation of those words, or the claimed subjective meaning intended for those words are both irrelevant: _Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal_ \[2010\]1 SLR 52 at \[27\] to \[28\]. The meanings thus established, the words will then be considered as defamatory if they tended to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally; or causes the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or exposes the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

### \- The objective meaning of the April 2017 website post:

18     I now recap the words complained off in the April 2017 website post. I noted that the website post was part of a series which Edmund published on EC’s website. Serving primarily a marketing purpose, those posts were published under different authorship pseudonyms which gave the impression of a degree of objectivity as to their contents. On 26 April 2017, Edmund publicly published a post titled “_Who Is The Best Economics Tutor In Singapore?_” on EC’s website using his wife’s name as the purported author (that spousal relationship was not stated). That post set out various ideal qualities which an economics tutor ought to have, i.e. academic qualifications, experience, intelligence, and passion. At various points, that post specifically cited Edmund and how he possessed each of those ideal qualities. The concluding part of the post then lists “Publicity” and referenced Anthony instead. The entirety of that passage (reproduced below) was complained off:

> _“Many students and parents believe that the best economics tutor is the economics tutor who has the greatest publicity. This is a very serious misconception. For example, the media exposure of economics tutor Anthony Fok is far greater than that of all the economics tutors in Singapore combined. However, the reason for his great media exposure is the vast amount of time and money he spends on marketing rather than his track record in teaching. A quick check on Google Search will reveal the incredibly large number of websites Anthony Fok has created for his expensive marketing effort. Indeed, one will also find out that Anthony Fok does not even have an internal degree in economics which some may find it hard to believe. Every economics tutor has a finite amount of time. Therefore, when more of their time is spent on marketing, it means that less of their time is spent on helping students.”_

19     Applying the objective legal approach to the passage published in that context as recounted, it was my judgment that an ordinary reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal, using his general knowledge and common sense, would understand the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the passage to be as follows:

> (a)     It is a very serious misconception for many students and parents to believe that the best economics tutor is the one who has the greatest publicity. \[comment\]

> (b)     The economics tutor Anthony was a case in point for the above proposition, i.e. that it is a **very serious misconception to believe that Anthony is the best economics tutor just because he had the greatest publicity**. \[comment\]

> (c)     Anthony’s media exposure was far greater than that of all the economics tutors in Singapore combined, but that was actually the result of the **vast amount of time and money he spent on marketing, rather than his track record as a JC economics tutor**. \[comment + fact\]

> (d)     Evidence of Anthony **spending such a vast amount of time and money on marketing** can be obtained through a quick check on Google Search, which will reveal the incredibly large number of websites Anthony has created for his expensive marketing efforts. \[comment + fact\]

> (e)      **Evidence of Anthony’s great media exposure having less to do with his track record as a JC economics tutor can be gleaned from the fact that he does not even have an internal degree in economics**, and it was hard for some to believe that the famed economics tutor actually lacked such university qualifications in the subject. An _internal degree_ may be understood with reference to the more widely accepted counterpart of an _external degree_. Whereas an _external degree_ was one which was conferred by a University on those who have passed its qualifying examinations (usually undertaken on a distance basis), regardless of whether those persons had attended its course of instruction or not, an _internal degree_ is one which is conferred by a University to its students who have passed its qualifying examinations after attending its course of instruction full-time at the university itself. \[fact + comment\]

> (f)     Tutors like Anthony who spend more of their time on marketing to promote themselves will have **less time left over to spend on helping students**. \[comment + fact\]

20     It was my judgment that the words in that passage were clearly defamatory given the meanings in (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f). In context, that passage explicitly sets out to lower Anthony in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally. This can be seen from the fact that the post starts positively with Edmund extolling himself and how he possessed the various ideal qualities of a good economics tutor, before flipping to the negative to explain why fame and publicity were not necessary qualities. Edmund could have established that point without naming names, but chose to reference Anthony specifically and hold Anthony up as an example under that negative section to explain why the famed economics tutor Anthony should not be held to high regard despite his fame. The words do this by making the **bold factual claim that Anthony’s fame and publicity as an economics tutor were actually due to his extensive marketing efforts rather than his tutoring track record**. It then attempts to justify that claim with reference to the fact that Anthony had created multiple websites for marketing, and that he actually did not even have relevant university qualifications in the subject. It then closes with a final factual flourish that **Anthony had limited time left over to spend on helping students because of all the emphasis he was placing on marketing himself instead**. All those statements clearly attack Anthony’s ability and credibility as an economics tutor and seek to denigrate the fame surrounding him. They do this by imputing that Anthony lacked relevant qualifications, knowledge, and skill as a JC economics tutor, and that the fame and publicity surrounding him were artificially trumped up through marketing. Given that Anthony was being held up as a negative example in the context of an article titled “_Who is the Best Economics Tutor in Singapore?_”, the obvious meaning being conveyed overall was that Anthony was far from being the best economics tutor in Singapore. It was clear to me that the meanings conveyed in the passage would have the effect of causing some to shun or avoid Anthony as a JC economics tutor, and/or expose Anthony to contempt or ridicule on account of his lacking in relevant university qualifications and his reliance on extensive marketing efforts to promote himself.

### \- The objective meaning of the October 2017 website post:

21     I now move on to address the next website post. To recap, on 5 October 2017, Edmund publicly published another post titled “_How Does One Be A Good Economics Tutor?_” on EC’s website under another authorship pseudonym “Mark Chua”. I noted that this post set out 4 ideals which an economics tutor ought to possess in order to be a good economics tutor, i.e. (1) Get a University Degree in Economics, (2) Passion for the Subject, (3) Keep Abreast of Current Affairs, and (4) Care for Students. Under the first section “Get a University Degree in Economics”, it contained the following impugned passage which made reference to Anthony:

> _“… An economics tutor without a university degree in economics is likely to have limited knowledge of the subject and therefore is likely to be ineffective in helping students excel in the examination. For example, the so-called super tutor Anthony Fok did not have a university degree in economics but was providing JC economics tuition. As a result, many of his students fared poorly in the examination, although he was able to get a large number of students initially through his high expenditure on marketing. …”_

22     Applying the objective legal approach to the passage published in that context as recounted, it was my judgment that the requisite ordinary reasonable person would understand the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the passage to be as follows:

> (a)     That JC economics tutors without a university degree in economics are likely to have limited knowledge of the subject, and are thus likely to be ineffective in helping JC economics students excel in their economics examination. \[comment\]

> (b)     That the so-called super tutor Anthony was a case in point for the above proposition, i.e. that **Anthony was, at a time, limited in his knowledge of the subject and was ineffective in helping JC students excel in their economics examination because he did not have a university degree in economics at that time**. \[comment + fact\]

> (c)     Evidence of Anthony’s limited knowledge and ineffectiveness as a tutor can be gleaned from the fact that **many of Anthony’s students fared poorly** in their JC economics examination during that period. \[fact\]

> (d)     That **Anthony managed to get a large number of students initially because of his high expenditure on marketing**. \[comment + fact\]

23     It was my judgment that the words in that passage were clearly defamatory given the meanings in (b), (c), and (d). In context, that passage explicitly sets out to lower Anthony in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally. This can be seen from the fact that the post explicitly holds Anthony up as a prime example for what can go wrong when a tutor does not have relevant university qualifications in the subject. Edmund could have established the proposition being put forward without naming names, i.e. that a university degree in economics was desirable for those seeking to tutor in JC economics, but he instead chose to reference Anthony specifically and name him as a negative example which confirmed the proposition he was citing. The words were especially toxic because they made the bold **factual claim that many of Anthony’s students had indeed fared poorly in their JC economics examination precisely because Anthony could not help them as he had limited knowledge in the subject due to his lacking a university degree in the subject during that period**. The words then go on to make the next bold **factual claim that Anthony managed to get a large number of students initially because of his high expenditure on marketing**. The statements clearly attack Anthony’s ability and credibility as an economics tutor and seek to denigrate the fame surrounding him. The only saving grace was that the statements were written in the past tense, and thus objectively referred to a state of affairs at some unstated earlier period of time, and permitted therefore the inference that it was no longer presently still the case. However, given that they all referred to Anthony as a negative example in the context of an article titled “_How Does One Be A Good Economics Tutor?_”, the obvious meaning being conveyed overall was that Anthony was not a good economics tutor because he did not possess one of the 4 critical ideals. It was clear to me that all those meanings conveyed in the passage would have the effect of causing some to shun or avoid Anthony as a JC economics tutor, and/or expose him to contempt or ridicule on account of the claims being made regarding his reliance on extensive marketing to attract students, and that many of his students had fared poorly due to his lack of university qualifications in the subject at that time.

24     Having set out the objective natural and ordinary meanings of the two 2017 website posts, I found substantive overlap with the claimed defamatory meanings set out in the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim (“SOC”). The objective meanings for the April 2017 website post coincided substantively with the claimed defamatory meanings at paragraph 75 of the SOC. Next, the objective meanings for the October 2017 website post coincided substantively with the claimed defamatory meanings at paragraph 65 of the SOC. For good order, the plaintiffs also pleaded that the words, insofar as they referred explicitly to the 1st plaintiff Anthony, also implicated by extension through innuendo the 2nd plaintiffs JCE. I agreed because at that time the 1st plaintiff taught exclusively at the 2nd plaintiffs and was its sole tutor; it was thus beyond any serious argument that their reputations as tuition providers, one as tutor and the other as tuition centre, were inextricably intertwined; even Edmund conceded this.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) As a result, the defendants’ attack on the 1st plaintiff’s reputation as a tutor had a similar effect on the reputation on the 2nd plaintiffs, with the words indicating that the 2nd plaintiffs were an undesirable choice for economics tuition due to all the claims being made about its tutor. Therefore, on account of the objective natural and ordinary meanings of the two 2017 website posts arrived at, I found that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs had established their case that the words in the two 2017 website posts were defamatory of them. I now turn to explain why the other defences being claimed for the two 2017 website posts were unsubstantiated.

### \- The Defences Claimed:

25     The main defence that the words did not carry any defamatory meaning was clearly untenable given the natural and ordinary meanings objectively arrived at. This point was graphically illustrated during Edmund’s cross-examination where he also conceded those natural and ordinary meanings.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) The other claimed defences at \[49\] to \[65\] of the Defence were variously (1) justification; (2) fair comment; and/or (3) that they were published under circumstances where qualified privilege applied. The legal position regarding those defences is that the defence bears the evidential burden to establish those claimed defences. Therefore, if the burden was undischarged at the end of the review, the justification defence would not be established and the averments would remain patently false; and if there was evidence of malice, it would potentially negate the defences of fair comment and qualified privilege: _Golden Season Pte Ltd v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 38</span> _(“Golden Season”)_, at \[85\]-\[96\]_._ An objective review of the evidence offered up by the defence during the trial would conclude that the defence had failed to discharge its evidential burden on all three claimed defences for the two 2017 website posts.

### \- The Flaws in the Justification Defence:

26     I turn first to the justification defence. This was pleaded at \[62\] and \[50\] in a limited manner with reference being made to only the following three statements in the two website posts:

> (i)     A quick check on Google Search will reveal the incredibly large number of websites Anthony Fok has created for his expensive marketing effort.

> (ii)     Indeed, one will also find out that Anthony Fok does not even have an internal degree in economics which some may find it hard to believe.

> (iii)     Anthony Fok did not have a university degree in economics but was providing JC economics tuition.

27     The limited manner in which the justification defence was being claimed meant that the bulk of the words in the two website posts, together with their concomitant defamatory meaning, remained beyond the ambit of the justification defence; with the legal consequence being that those words were effectively untrue because they remained unjustified. For instance, some of the more notable defamatory imputations in those words which were left beyond the ambit of the justification defence were ‘that Anthony had managed to attract a large number of students initially because of his high expenditure on extensive marketing’, and that ‘many of Anthony’s students fared poorly in their JC economics examinations’ – those examples and the other averments were all left out entirely from the pleaded justification defence. To the extent that this justification defence was being claimed, I found that it therefore actually offered no meaningful shield because the sting lay beyond its claimed ambit. In effect, the defence was taking a flawed literal approach in invoking the justification defence; in the context of the objective natural and ordinary meanings of the two 2017 website posts arrived at \[19\] and \[22\], it really mattered not whether Anthony had created an ‘_incredibly large number of websites for his expensive marketing effort_’ (in point i.) or that he ‘_was providing tuition when he did not have a degree in economics – whether external or internal_’ (in point ii. and iii.). Those were in fact plainly undisputed matters: it was an open admission by Anthony that his first degree was in Accounting from NUS and that he went on to earn a further external degree in Economics from Murdoch University only in June 2016[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24); it was also similarly openly stated that the various websites were associated with Anthony.[^25] The truth in those areas was ultimately immaterial because they did not form the defamatory imputation being put forward in the two 2017 website posts. In effect, the defence was justifying that which need not be justified, and leaving unaddressed the defamatory stings instead. The legal position when a justification defence is being claimed is for the defence to prove the _sting_ of the words, i.e. “_the meaning that must be proven true must be that which the relevant statement is held to bear_”, and “_it is the imputation contained in the words which has to be justified, not the literal truth of the word_”: _Golden Season_ at \[85\]. Therefore, if a justification defence is to be invoked for the two 2017 website posts, then the relevant defamatory imputation which the defence had to prove true in substance and in fact – recited in condensed form – was **that Anthony’s fame and success was due to extensive marketing rather than his abilities as a tutor**, and that **he was actually an inferior tutor because he lacked relevant university qualifications**. As pleaded, the justification defence was flawed because it did not cover those areas at all, and this defence thus became a complete non-issue.

28     Despite the flaw in the defence’s pleading, Edmund nonetheless attempted to reinvoke this justification defence during the trial by going beyond what was pleaded by him. I now explain what he did, and why it nonetheless made no difference.

29     Edmund offered his personal inference on both areas as justification, but inference does not count as factual evidence. An example of Edmund offering his inference can be seen at \[77\] of his AEIC where he states that he _‘_**_formed the view_** _that Anthony’s ability to perform as an economics tutor was limited by his lack of a degree in economics’_ (**_emphasis_** added). That bald statement – which betrayed his prejudice – was not accompanied by any factual evidence in justification. I can say that because a review of Edmund’s entire AEIC will plainly reveal nothing which he could point to from 2017 or earlier which afforded him justification to arrive at that view when he published those posts in 2017. The closest that Edmund came to offering a semblance of factual evidence was at \[78\] of his AEIC where he alluded to the ‘student’s 50% distinction rate’ allegedly achieved by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs, a statistic which Edmund obtained under false pretenses only on the 11th October **2019**; in gist, Edmund posed as a prospective customer and allegedly made enquiries to the 2nd plaintiffs on its distinction rate.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) That was a plainly desperate attempt to find justification by Edmund, and it was also ultimately futile because it remained apparent that Edmund did not have all this in 2017 and that he actually therefore had nothing in terms of evidence in 2017 which afforded him basis to credibly form that view in 2017 and to issue those public defamatory statements in 2017 about Anthony’s inferiority as a tutor on account of his lacking in relevant university qualifications – a point which Edmund also ultimately conceded in cross-examination.[^27] It also bears mention that those statistics were disputed (the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs claim a much higher distinction rate achievement), and it also turned out that the evidence – comprising of an alleged screenshot of the messages between Edmund whilst under pretenses and the 2nd plaintiffs – were **manipulated and incomplete**; admissions which Edmund also conceded in cross-examination, and which he ultimately offered no excusable account for.[^28] Even if one were to look past that dismal conduct by Edmund, and admit that the distinction rate achieved by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs in their earlier years was indeed lower, the basis to conclude that it had any connection with Anthony not having an economics degree at that time remained unproven and was speculative at best. In any event, a ‘50% distinction rate’ also did not constitute proof that “many of Anthony’s students fared poorly in their JC economics examinations”. The next attempt by Edmund at justification on this area was just as desperate and ineffective: he made reference to “_a few parents_” having apparently informed him that their “_children did not show any improvement in their results_” after attending classes run by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs.[^29] That woeful resort to conveniently self-serving hearsay was vague and undated. Even if those instances did take place sometime before his publication, they objectively did not provide basis either for Edmund’s inference because the exact reason(s) for those few students not having shown any improvements in their results was never established, and it remained speculative at best that it somehow had something to do with Anthony’s lack of a university degree in economics. At the same time, those few instances of “_not showing improvement_” also did not provide any basis for his statement that “**_many_** _of Anthony’s students fared poorly in their JC economics examinations_” (**_emphasis_** added); the two being quite different.

30     Turning to the next defamatory aspect in the two 2017 website posts, Edmund also attempted to offer up evidence during the trial to justify his belief that Anthony’s fame and success was due to extensive marketing efforts rather than his track record/abilities as a tutor. This evidence was set out at \[79\] of his AEIC where Edmund indicated that Anthony used a Public Relations (“PR”) company and had set up multiple websites for his marketing efforts. As it turned out, it became apparent during cross-examination that Edmund only came into possession of that information in **2019**.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) This again showed that Edmund plainly had nothing in 2017 or earlier which afforded him basis to arrive at that belief in 2017 and to justify his public defamatory statements about Anthony then. Even if it was admitted that Anthony had used a PR company and had set up multiple websites, and that Edmund somehow knew all that in 2017, those facts objectively did not provide basis either for Edmund to arrive at that belief because the link between those facts with Anthony’s fame and success having less to do with his tutoring track record remained completely unproven and speculative. Whilst I accept that Anthony’s PR company _may_ have helped in getting him featured in some/all of those articles, I think it is beyond serious argument that the chances of a tutor being featured, plus the manner in which they were being featured, would have been quite different if that tutor was mediocre and had nothing by way of achievements to speak off. A review of all the media articles themselves bears this out: in one form or another, each piece indicated that Anthony was being featured and/or quoted precisely because he had a commendable tutoring track record, i.e. that there was either a high and/or increasing demand for his tutoring services, and/or that he had managed to help students improve in their grades.[^31] Given the lack of evidence to indicate that reasonable grounds existed at the time of publication for Edmund to make those statements, it became apparent that his attempt to denigrate all of that fame and success as instead being the result of Anthony’s marketing efforts was cynical at best and clearly defamatory.

31     In the end, an objective review of Edmund’s attempt to reinvoke the justification defence showed that his own personal inferences based on entirely dubious and/or _ex-post facto_ evidence were being offered up, and that Edmund actually had no factual evidence from that period, and thus no basis to justify his coming to those inferences and beliefs about Anthony in 2017 and to make those public defamatory statements about him then. This also meant that, even if the flawed defence pleading on justification was rectified, it would still have failed because there was simply no factual evidence available to support it. At the end of the review on this part, it was plain that the defendants held a flawed conception of the justification defence, failed to plead it properly, and also failed to discharge their evidential burden on that defence. The result: the defamatory imputations were not justified and therefore remained patently false. The probity of that result was bolstered given that the evidence which was before the court on this area (offered up by the plaintiffs and which remained consistent, coherent, and credible even after the cross-examination) indicated, in gist, that Anthony’s super tutor fame arose precisely on account of his abilities as an economics tutor, and that he was an accomplished tutor with a range of relevant university qualifications.

### \- The Flaws in the Fair Comment Defence:

32     Turning next to the fair comment defence, this was pleaded at \[64\] and \[52\] in the Defence. When a fair comment defence is claimed, the legal position places the onus on the defence to prove four elements: (1) that the words were comments; (2) that the comments were based on facts; (3) that the comments were of the kind which a fair-minded person could honestly make based on the facts proved; and (4) that the comments were on a matter of public interest: _Golden Season_ at \[93\]. Given the objective natural and ordinary meanings of the two 2017 website posts arrived at in \[19\] and \[22\] above, I accepted that they were capable of being classified as comments save for the statement in the October 2017 website post where Edmund made the factual claim that “_many of Anthony’s students from that period had fared poorly in their JC economics examination_”. Being a factual assertion, that statement remained beyond the ambit of the fair comment defence. For the rest of the statements, while the fair comment defence potentially applied, I found that it failed because the defendants had not proven the facts upon which those statements rested. In essence, the defence had failed to discharge its evidential burden in establishing element (2). In that regard, I acknowledged that the defence has invoked reliance on section 9 of the Defamation Act which states that “… _a defence of fair comment shall not fail by reason only that the truth of_ **_every_** _allegation of fact is not proved_…” but I found that this reliance did not save the defence because that same provision goes on to state “… _if the expression of opinion is fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged or referred to in the words complained of_ **_as are proved_**_._” Put another way, section 9 does not entirely relieve the defence from the onus of establishing its factual case. Moreover, caselaw indicates that where the allegation is more serious, correspondingly stronger evidence will need to be adduced in support: _Qingdao Bohai Construction Group Co. Ltd. and Ors v Goh Teck Beng and Anor._ \[2016\]4 SLR 977 at \[169\] (“_Qingdao_”). I found the Defence’s failure to discharge its evidential onus in this area to be abject. As set out earlier, the review of the defence’s evidence on this area showed that it consisted entirely of Edmund’s personal inferences being offered up as fact, inferences which were based on entirely dubious and/or _ex-post facto_ matters; all of which lacked credibility for evidential consideration. Since there was no factual basis for any of the comments, by extension, the next element (3) was also not established. There was no basis to claim that the comments were of such a nature which a fair-minded person could have honestly made since there was no factual foundation to support those comments. Finally, the next element (4) also consequently could not be said to be made out because no arguable public interest (more will be said about this later in the next section on the defence of qualified privilege) could be served in holding Anthony up as a specific negative example in that manner if Edmund actually did not have any factual basis to support those statements he was making about Anthony. For each of those reasons cited, I found that the fair comment defence did not apply.

### \- The Flaws in the Qualified Privilege Defence:

33     The final defence claimed for the 2017 website posts was that of qualified privilege, and this was pleaded at \[65\] and \[53\] of the Defence. When a qualified privilege defence is claimed, the legal position requires the defence to prove that the defendants had a legal/social/moral interest/duty to publish those statements about Anthony to that particular recipient, and that the particular recipient had a corresponding reciprocal interest/duty to receive that information: _Golden Season_ at \[89\]. The privilege to issue defamatory statements about others without incurring liability for defamation was qualified on the basis that it attached only to the occasion where because of the existence of that relationship between the defendant and the recipient, it gave rise to that interest/duty to make that statement; and for this reason, the defence of qualified privilege **normally only attached to the private communications** made between those parties on that occasion under that interest/duty context: _Golden Season_ at \[88\]. Indeed, after reviewing all the cases cited by the parties in their bundles, it is apparent that the defence of qualified privilege has never been held to apply in cases such as the present where the defendant **publicly broadcasts** defamatory statements about another person **indiscriminately to the world at large** through its website on a **perpetual and open-ended occasion** on the basis of some **self-perceived** social/moral interest/duty to save that public from engaging the services of that person because he was, in the opinion of the defendant, an inferior service provider – that being the defence’s own pleaded case.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) Effectively, the defence was inviting this court to lay down new caselaw to extend this defence of qualified privilege to this exact scenario. Having considered the matter, I did not find good reasons to do so. First, as recounted earlier, there was no factual basis for those statements about the plaintiffs, and this was so fundamental a failure that the question of granting privilege does not even rise to be considered. Second, putting aside for the moment the lack of evidence in justification, I found the need for the public to hear those specific views which Edmund had about Anthony to be entirely doubtful. There was nothing inherently of special value to those views since Edmund was offering them up from a position of no particular superior standing apart from being another private tutor himself – even if he was, in his own words, “_arguably the best economics tutor in Singapore_”. The public’s needs would have been entirely served by Edmund establishing those general propositions as useful public reminders, i.e. that it is good to conduct one’s own due diligence checks on a prospective tutor. There was no further public need to be served in granting Edmund the immunity privilege to specifically target and denigrate a fellow industry competitor and cause injury in that manner – especially since there was no evidence in justification. Extending the defence of qualified privilege in such circumstances would be to grant licence to all manner of purportedly self-righteous individuals to make all kinds of defamatory statements publicly about others on the basis of the slightest self-perceived social/moral interest/duty, and there was no good rationale for this court to bring about that state of affairs. Indeed, the authorities indicate that the qualified privilege immunity should not be granted where the defendant defames the plaintiff due to a subjective view that it was in the general welfare of society for those defamatory statements to be made: _Golden Season_ at \[89\]-\[90\]. For all of these reasons, I therefore did not find that the defence of qualified privilege had any application, or scope for application, in this case.

### \- Conclusion in relation to the two 2107 website posts:

34     For all the reasons stated above, I found the two 2017 website posts published by the defendants were clearly defamatory against the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs. A review of the evidence also indicated that none of the claimed defences were ever established. I now move on to set out my findings on the next segment of events in 2019.

## II.   Whether the 2019 utterance, emails and Facebook posts were defamatory?

35     The context for the 2019 incidents have been set out in the introduction. As recounted, there were a total of 6 separate instances of the defendants’ actions in 2019 which were being taken to task: the first involved the oral utterance by Edmund to Esther at Popular Bookstore, whilst the rest involved publications by the defendants targeted to the rest of the world (set out in Annex A to E). Beyond that difference in their form, all 6 instances were actually substantively similar at their core because they all involved the same recitation of the central **alleged admission** which Edmund claims Anthony made to him after they had cause to interact directly for the first time. To recap, the alleged admission was Edmund’s claim that during the course of their second phone call on 13 January 2019, Anthony had voluntarily admitted making a:

> “_grave mistake in asking his students to write some of the Textbooks, and requested that some time be given for the current copies of the said Textbooks (i.e. those authored by his students) which were then displayed for sale in bookstores in Singapore to be sold out and he would thereafter revise the contents of the Textbooks.”__[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33)_

36     This alleged admission formed the sole linch pin upon which a host of other connected allegations (relating to connected admissions, proof of those admissions, and the lack of subsequent denials) were wrapped round by Edmund when he took steps to publicise that alleged admission to others. A review of Annex A to E will show that those connected allegations were:

> a.     That it was ‘**recently brought to Edmund’s attention** that of the approximately twenty books published by Anthony in the short span of a year or so, most were written by his students’ (Annex A, B, C, D & E). _NB_: In Edmund’s last iteration at Annex E, he shortened that period of alleged publication to “_a few months_”.

> b.     That Edmund decided to ‘**speak with Anthony to verify that fact**’, and that was when Anthony made the alleged admission to him and pleaded for time to allow those books to sell out (Annex A, B, C, D & E).

> c.     That Anthony also admitted to Edmund that ‘his former economics teachers had advised him against publishing such books, but he **did not heed their advice**’ (Annex A, B, C, D, & E).

> d.     That after those admissions were made, Edmund told Anthony he ‘**would report the matter to Popular Bookstore** to let them decide the best way to deal with the case’ because Anthony’s proposal (of letting the books sell out) ‘would not have been good for students’ (Annex A, B, C, D, & E). Edmund believed that ‘such books were likely to do students more harm than good, as those \[student authors\] may not have had a good grasp of the key economic concepts’ (Annex A & B). _NB_: In his later iterations, Edmund changed this to ‘were unlikely to have a thorough understanding of the key economic concepts’ (Annex C, D, & E). _NB:_ In his final iteration at Annex E, Edmund added justification for that view by stating that Anthony was ‘tutoring in economics for a few years even though he did not have a university degree in economics, and that Anthony was only _recently_ awarded an external degree in economics from Murdoch University after attending classes at a private school in Singapore’ (_emphasis_ added).

> e.     That when ‘Popular Bookstore sought to verify the fact with Anthony, Anthony **did not dispute** that fact, and Popular Bookstore has since taken down those books from sale’ (Annex A, B, C, D, & E). _NB_: This verification allegation was subsequently clarified by Edmund in his later iterations at Annex D & E, that the verification was done ‘through Anthony’s representative: Ken Tan, the manager at CPD, which was the publisher for those textbooks’.

> f.     That Anthony ‘has **expressed remorse**, realized his grave mistake, and was willing to accept the consequences’. Edmund then ‘strongly advised students who have possession of those textbooks to discontinue using them’ (Annex C, D, & E).

> g.     That Edmund had ‘subsequently sent Anthony **two SMS messages to document the alleged admission**, specifically the part where he admitted his mistake’ (Annex D & E).

### \- The objective meaning of the words:

37     Applying the objective legal approach to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of those words, it was my judgment that an ordinary reasonable person, not unduly suspicious or avid for scandal, using his general knowledge and common sense, would arrive at an understanding that those words bear their exact literal meaning apparent on their face and as set out above. The words were uncomplicated and were strung together in a manner to afford a clear and immediate message: in gist and at their core, that Anthony had admitted to Edmund that he made a grave mistake of publishing textbooks under his own name but which were actually written by his students instead. Further, that despite knowing that such actions were wrong, Anthony nonetheless still requested to be allowed to sell out the current copies of those impugned textbooks. That central alleged admission, padded and wrapped with all the other connected allegations of further admissions, lack of denials and proof, all unambiguously attacked the honesty and integrity of Anthony as a tutor and author, for not only taking short cuts in publishing, credit for other people’s work, deceiving retailers and the public that the books were written by him, but also for the temerity in seeking to be allowed to sell out those impugned textbooks despite acknowledging that it was all gravely wrong. Indeed, this aspect about Anthony’s conduct falling short of acceptable tutor standards was explicitly alluded to by Edmund himself in Annex A when he cited the “_Professional Code of Conduct for Tutors_” and how tutors should ‘act with honesty and integrity in all aspects of their work’. In context, the words clearly set out to lower Anthony in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally, and would have the effect of causing some to shun or avoid Anthony as a tutor and/or author, and expose Anthony to hatred, contempt or ridicule on account of the claims being made. Evidence of this was also present before the court: out of the thousands of followers which the defendants had on Facebook, there were multiple reactions from public members to Edmund’s posts where shock, anger and revulsion were expressed at the plaintiffs’ alleged actions[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34), and the reaction of the Group CEO at Popular Bookstore where concerns of fraud and deceit were similarly expressed about the plaintiff’s alleged conduct[^35]. Further, the words also clearly attacked Anthony’s repute as an author for issuing textbooks which were of poor quality and were unfit for purpose because their content had come from students who lacked qualifications themselves in the subject. Indeed, Edmund could not have been clearer in his denouncement of Anthony’s textbooks when he ‘strongly urged all to discontinue their use’ because they ‘did more harm than good’. As a result, I found the defendants’ words in all 6 instances of the 2019 utterance, emails, and Facebook posts, to be clearly defamatory, and that they all coincided substantively with the plaintiffs’ pleaded case regarding their meanings at \[8\], \[24\], \[35\], and \[52\] respectively of the SOC. For good order, the plaintiffs also pleaded that the words, insofar as they referred explicitly to the 1st plaintiff Anthony, also implicated by extension through innuendo the 2nd plaintiffs JCE, and 3rd plaintiffs CPD. I agreed; for the same reasons set out earlier at \[24\] for the 2nd plaintiffs JCE. In relation to the 3rd plaintiff CPD, I agreed as well given that CPD was closely associated with Anthony who held all of its shares of ownership and who published his textbooks – including all of those impugned textbooks – exclusively through it. Additionally, Edmund’s recount of Ken’s reaction to Esther indicated that CPD was complicit in Anthony’s fraudulent activities and did not itself see any problem with distribution of those books published in that manner. In these circumstances, the main defence pleaded that the words did not carry any defamatory meaning of the plaintiffs was clearly untenable. This point was also graphically illustrated during Edmund’s cross-examination where he contradicted his own pleaded Defence and conceded that the natural and ordinary meanings of the words were indeed defamatory.[^36] I now turn to explain why the other defences claimed were unsubstantiated.

### \- The Flaws in the Justification Defence:

38     The defence asserted that all the claims were true in substance and in fact, pleading particulars which closely coincided with each of the claims being made.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) The only additional particulars pleaded were 1. to name the manager at Popular Bookstore to whom Edmund had made the complaint to (i.e. Esther), who was then overseeing the sale of textbooks and assessment books, and 2. to particularise how the lack of denials supported the defence case about the truth of the alleged admission. To discharge its evidential burden on those claims, the defence called Esther as its witness. To refute those claims, the plaintiffs called Ken and Christopher as their witnesses. One observation ought to be made at this point: that the justification for the 2019 utterance relied only on Edmund’s testimony, whilst the justification for the rest of the 2019 instances relied on a combination of evidence beyond just Edmund’s testimony. Having objectively reviewed all the evidence placed before the court, including that which came from the two main protagonists themselves, I found that the defence had failed to discharge its evidential burden to show that the claims were true in substance and in fact. The reasons are set out below (what follows is a long section where each unsatisfactory aspect of the defence case and its evidence offered in the justification is detailed):

> a.      **Edmund’s Account - I:** An objective review of the defence case would show that the evidence about the alleged admission came solely from Edmund because only he heard it. I recognised that a case can be sustained on account of one person’s testimony if that testimony appears coherent and credible. In this case however, Edmund’s testimony was neither. The context offered up by him in his recount of how Anthony came to make the alleged admission to him was set out at \[9\] to \[21\] of his AEIC.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) It starts with a claim that as early as 2018, an unnamed fellow tutor had told him that “_many of Anthony’s books were written by the students whom he tutored_”.[^39] If this were so, then this ought to have been pleaded as part of the matters which afforded the defence justification, and it ought not to have been introduced late in evidence like this. When probed in cross-examination on the exact details, Edmund named that tutor as one “Jacky Lee” and that the conversation took place in “_January 2018_”. Edmund then claims that he went to browse through Anthony’s books a “_few weeks later_” and found numerous errors in them.[^40] Despite apparently being troubled enough by that news to embark on that verification, and despite having his concerns confirmed in that exercise, Edmund apparently took no further action on the matter. I found Edmund’s inaction in those circumstances incongruous given his professed concern for ‘the well-being of students and for standards in the tutoring profession’ in general. That inaction was especially incongruous when one considers that Anthony was already in Edmund’s sights by then for being a sub-standard tutor who lacked qualifications and who relied on slick marketing instead (see Edmund’s 2017 website posts about Anthony). If Edmund was truly concerned about those matters, and/or if those matters were truly concerning, then there was no conceivable reason for Edmund to just let the matter lie like that and allow for those sub-standard books to remain in circulation to the detriment of both students and profession. When probed on this, Edmund had no coherent answer and could only cite that he took action a year later when a chance opportunity presented itself.[^41] I found that incongruous and unexplained gap in his narrative troubling.

> b.      **Edmund’s Account - II:** That chance opportunity was set out by Edmund at \[15\] to \[17\] of his AEIC. In gist, Edmund said that he found out by chance in January 2019 that Anthony had acquired a position which afforded possible influence over the distribution of one of his books. Concerned about a “conflict of interest” where ‘preferential prioritisation of distribution’ would adversely affect his book, he called Christopher on 11 January 2019 to express his concerns. Despite Christopher’s explanations and assurances, Edmund decided to immediately terminate the distribution agreement which he had with Christopher/MarketAsia. About an hour after that telephone call with Christopher, Edmund said he received an unexpected phone call from Anthony, and that was when they spoke directly for the first time. Edmund said that Anthony started the conversation by trying to assuage his concerns over the distribution of his book, but Edmund remained unmoved and told Anthony that he had already decided to terminate the distribution agreement. It was at that point that Anthony then mentioned that he had “_recently obtained an external degree in economics from Murdoch University by attending classes at Kaplan_” and that he “_completed the course with a great deal of difficulty, particularly with the quantitative economics modules_”.[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) Edmund then explained to Anthony that he was actually busy and asked for the conversation to continue another day before ending the call. This account appeared rather strained and artificial: i.e. that Anthony, knowing full well that he was contacting a fellow industry competitor for the first time, one who was upset over the fairness of the competitive actions being undertaken between them, would speak out of turn of those circumstances about his external degree experiences instead. It had no relevance, and was especially doubtful that it would come up as a topic when one considered the objective fact that those degree experiences were already quite dated by then and were from several years before and not at all “_recent_” (it was an objective fact that Anthony was awarded his Murdoch degree in June 2016[^43], and that meant that the lessons were from even before that, facts which Edmund already knew given his 2017 website posts about Anthony’s qualifications). I acknowledged that there are some who may indeed speak irrelevantly, e.g. those who seek to fill awkward silences, and it was a matter of judgment whether Anthony fell into this category. After having observed Anthony as he testified in court before me (and more will be said on this later), I did not find Anthony to be the sort. The incongruity of this aspect in Edmund’s story therefore remained. When probed on this incongruity in cross-examination, Edmund himself conceded that he could offer no reason as to why it would have been mentioned by Anthony like that.[^44] The lack of coherence of this aspect in his narrative remained troubling.

> c.      **Edmund’s Account - III:** Edmund’s account about how the alleged admission was next offered up to him also suffered from the same coherence issues. Edmund claims that after that initial and unexpected phone call from Anthony, he decided to call Anthony back because Edmund “_wanted to verify the information_” he had received that some of Anthony’s books were written by his students.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) The two spoke two days later on 13 January 2019 with Edmund starting the conversation by telling Anthony that he had “_heard from someone that many of Anthony’s books were written by his students_”, and that Edmund had also “_found numerous conceptual errors in his books_”. Edmund claims that Anthony kept silent for a moment before admitting in a nervous tone that “_his students were involved in writing some of his books and that it was a grave mistake on his part_” and that “_his former economics teachers had also advised him against publishing such books_”. Edmund then replied that “_since the books were not written by him, the matter must be reported to Popular Bookstore, which was the main seller of Anthony’s books_”. In response, Anthony then pleaded for Edmund to give him “_some time and that once the current copies of the books which were then on sale at Popular Bookstore were sold out, he would revise the contents of all his books_”. Anthony pleaded because he explained that he recently suffered losses of more than $450,000 in various investments. Edmund however then told Anthony that “_it would be bad for students to use and rely on such books and that he would inform Popular Bookstore about the matter and let them decide the best way to deal with it_”.[^46] The 40+ minute phone call then ended with Anthony stating that they should “_keep in touch and meet up one day_”[^47] (the call duration was objectively recorded in the call records which Edmund retrieved).[^48] I found this account straining belief: if Anthony was indeed the brazen and repeated fraudster of an author as claimed, one who was selfishly concerned about his own money interests above all else, why would such a character so readily admit his wrong-doing – not once, but twice – to an industry competitor whom he hardly knew, and who just 2 days before had remained unplacated over the fairness of the state of their competition, and who was now calling him out of the blue to confront him on a most serious matter concerning his integrity? Further, that after making the alleged admission, and being informed by that competitor that he would use that admission against him, make no further response to that threat, and proceed instead to say that they should ‘stay in touch and meet up one day’. For all this to be accepted, there had to be cause to believe that Anthony was that sort, and there was none, apart from Edmund’s own incredible claims. When questioned on the coherence of this aspect of his narrative, Edmund simply refused to address the point.[^49] That stance did not really surprise given the plainly indefensible position which he was offering up as his narrative. I noted with concern as well that the account also differed from Edmund’s own pleaded case. Apart from some details being different between the two (about errors in the books, about not heeding advice, and about suffering losses), the alleged admission itself had also morphed: in the pleaded case, and in the wording in all the Annexes from A to E, the alleged admission was always that Anthony admitted that “_his students wrote some of the textbooks_”, but when Edmund offered the evidence to justify this, the alleged admission he recounted was instead that Anthony admitted “_that his students were involved in writing some of his books_”. The two positions were materially different and it appeared as if Edmund had let slip in introducing the latter version which objectively afforded more permutations as to how the books were written, including some permutations which were not objectionable at all. When questioned on this in cross-examination, Edmund fumbled and it was concerning that the only person who heard the alleged admission was having so much difficulty staying consistent on what exactly was allegedly said to him. If his account on the alleged admission was based on fact, it was objectively simple enough for consistency to be expected in its recount. Edmund’s wavering on this key aspect did not inspire confidence in his credibility and raised concerns instead as to whether his account was based on a factual recall or whether he was tripping up over the various details of a constructed narrative. Finally, if Edmund’s account were true and complete, then it would not have taken the 40+ minutes as recorded in the call logs. Even if those matters recounted were repeated, it would have taken a fraction of that recorded time. It was therefore apparent that some other matters were discussed in that time, and which Edmund was selectively leaving out from his account. Objectively exposed in that manner, the wavering account involving an incredible admission remained a most unconvincing prospect.

> d.      **Edmund’s Account - IV:** After the call where the alleged admission was made, Edmund claims that he “_immediately sent two SMS messages to Anthony to recap the gist of the telephone conversation, in particular Anthony’s admission_”.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) Edmund claims that Anthony did not respond to those texts. This was the final aspect of Edmund’s narrative where the inaction and lack of denials by Anthony was being offered up as proof for the justification defence. For that to be accepted, the veracity of Edmund’s claims up to this point had to be beyond reproach (i.e. that he had indeed confronted Anthony in that manner, and that Anthony had indeed made the alleged admission). That was not the case given all the reasons set out earlier. In fact, given the poor quality of Edmund’s narrative up to this point, it was doubtful that those messages even dealt with the issue of the alleged admission. This was in fact the position explained by Anthony, i.e. that the messages were innocuous and uncontroversial and for which he found no cause to respond to, or to retain them (the phone which Anthony used during that period was also no longer available as it was discarded after a wetting incident resulted in it becoming non-functional). The circumstances therefore really called out for those SMS messages to be produced since both the alleged admission and those SMS messages were being challenged. Edmund failed to produce them, explaining that the phone used to send those messages had been “reset/reformatted” by him sometime in June 2019 before he handed it to his son for his use.[^51] In Edmund’s account, he had those messages for 6 months and not even a single screenshot of them was saved; this despite an investigation then still on-going pursuant to his oral complaint to Popular Bookstore. Given that those messages formed the only contemporaneous record of proof that the alleged admission was ever made – something which Edmund was evidently conscious of given his repeated claims in Annex D & E where he recited that he had sent those messages as proof of his position – Edmund’s lack of care surrounding their retention in those circumstances appeared completely incongruous. This was especially the case when one considers that his professed purpose in calling Anthony in the first place was to verify and obtain proof that Anthony’s books were written by his students. Having finally obtained that proof after a long period of suspicion, Edmund inexplicably took no steps to preserve that proof. This aspect of Edmund’s narrative was most unsatisfactory, and threw doubt over whether those SMS messages even dealt with the alleged admission as claimed.

> e.      **Conclusion on Whether the Justification Defence had been Established for the Defamatory Utterance:** Given the state of the evidence being offered up to prove the alleged admission, I found that there was no basis to conclude that the defence had discharged its evidential burden in establishing the justification for Edmund’s utterance to Esther at Popular Bookstore. It bears repeating that the law not only requires the defence to provide proof in justification, but where the allegation being made was serious, then correspondingly stronger proof was required: _Qingdao_ at \[169\]. In the present case, I found that the substance of Edmund’s singular testimony regarding having received the alleged admission from Anthony, to be flawed, inconsistent and contradicted, and did not therefore pass muster.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) This result meant that the alleged admission was unproven and therefore remained patently false. Edmund’s actions in uttering that defamatory falsehood to Esther at Popular Bookstore therefore had no defence in justification.

> f.      **Other Evidence – I:** I turn next to address the other category of evidence claimed by the defence in justification for the defamatory statements in Annex A to E, i.e. the lack of denials by Anthony (through his representative, Ken) when Popular Bookstore sought to investigate the complaint lodged by Edmund. The defence position was that Popular Bookstore’s verification exercise – though sparked off by Edmund’s complaint – was substantively independent and that it resulted in clear evidence that Anthony’s books were indeed written by his students. I acknowledged that the defence position was conceptually sound, but a review of the evidence did not yield the same conclusion. In the following sections, I explain why I could not agree with that interpretation of the evidence. I start by setting out the evidence being claimed. Edmund claimed that he called and spoke with Esther on 14 January 2019 as she was then overseeing the sales of textbooks and assessment books at Popular Bookstore. Edmund told Esther that Anthony had, the day before, admitted to him that “_some of Anthony’s books were_ **_written by Anthony’s students_**”, and Edmund requested Esther to verify the matter. Esther then told Edmund that she would “_look into the matter_”.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) Esther confirmed that account.[^54] Esther explained that her usual procedure following a complaint like that was to verify the issue with the publisher. She then “_immediately_” called Ken and informed him that Edmund had made that complaint to her, i.e. that some of Anthony’s books were **written by his students**.[^55] Ken then told Esther that he would check with Anthony on the matter, and they agreed to meet on 16 January 2019 to discuss the matter further. On that scheduled day, Ken proceeded to meet Esther, and one Ms Seah Neai Nah (“**Seah**”). Seah was then Esther’s superior.[^56] Esther claims that she started the meeting by reiterating that Edmund had made that complaint to her, and she asked Ken whether it was true. In response, “_Ken Tan just smiled and said casually that in the publishing industry, normally the contents of a book were written by a team of people and that only the most prominent author in the team would be featured and named as author_”.[^57] Esther perceived Ken’s response as being rather evasive because he neither admitted nor denied the complaint, and appeared to be suggesting that a team of people had written Anthony’s books. Esther then told Ken that the books might have to be returned if the issue remained unresolved.[^58] At that point, Seah then became concerned that the sales revenue of Popular Bookstore would be affected, and in view of the cordial relationship between Ken and Popular Bookstore, Seah decided that Popular Bookstore might consider keeping some of the best-selling titles if it was confirmed that Anthony was the author of those selected titles.[^59] They then went through the sales reports for all 20 titles from Anthony which were then being sold through Popular Bookstore and selected 6 titles which had the highest sales volume; Esther then told Ken that Popular Bookstore would continue to sell those 6 titles if Ken confirmed that they were written by Anthony.[^60] Ken then requested for some time to check and revert on the issue.[^61] The next day (17 January 2019), Esther said she received another phone call from Edmund who sought an update from her on the matter. Esther said she informed Edmund that she and Seah had a meeting with Ken the previous day, and that Ken’s “_only response to the queries about the authorship of Anthony’s books was a smile and Ken Tan did not refute the complaint_”.[^62] Esther also informed Edmund that Ken had requested for some time to check with Anthony about the authorship of Anthony’s books. The next day (18 January 2019), Esther said she received an email from Ken stating “_As discussed, it is confirmed that the \[6\] titles listed in attached are authored by Anthony Fok. Please do let us know when would the rest of titles (Economics) be returned_”.[^63] Esther said she accepted that confirmation in good faith, and that the remaining 14 titles were eventually returned to CPD. Esther added that this was the first time Popular Bookstore had removed such a large number of titles by a particular author from sale. Finally, on 1 February 2019, Esther said Edmund called her again to enquire on the outcome, and she told Edmund “_that Ken Tan had confirmed that 6 of the Anthony Fok’s books were authored by Anthony and Popular Bookstore would be removing the remaining 14 titles from sale_”.[^64]

> g.      **Other Evidence – II:** Returning to Edmund’s account, Edmund added that he actually also called Esther on 16 January 2019 to seek an update, and was told by Esther that she was meeting Ken later that day to verify the issue.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) I noted that Esther made no mention of this call in her account. More crucially, Edmund added that after that call to Esther, he called Ken directly and told Ken about the complaint he had lodged with Popular Bookstore. Edmund explained that he had known Ken for a long time as he was one of the distributors of his book. Edmund claimed that they ended the conversation by “_wanting to catch up with each other socially at Edmund’s residence the next day_”.[^66] Ken did ultimately meet Edmund on 17 January 2019, and Edmund said that he reiterated that he made the complaint to Popular Bookstore, and he asked Ken how his meeting with Popular Bookstore went, but Ken ‘did not answer his question, and also did not deny the complaint’. Edmund then decided not to pursue it further. Edmund also curiously then said that he “_then learned of Ken’s poor health and his reluctance to participate actively in the publishing industry_”, no further context was provided by Edmund for including that averment.[^67] Edmund confirmed the rest of Esther’s account, and also went on to offer up an additional material detail: that on 18 January 2019, he called Anthony “_to inform him that I had made the complaint because I did not want students’ performance in the subject to be adversely affected by the usage of Anthony’s books which contained many conceptual errors._ **_Anthony expressed his understanding and told me that he bore no grudge against me._** _We then went on to chat casually. …_”.[^68] Therefore, on the basis of (1) Ken’s reactions to Esther, (2) Ken’s reactions to Edmund at his home, and (3) Anthony’s reactions to Edmund in that further phone call on 18 January 2019, the defence contended that it was thus verified that “_Anthony had misrepresented himself as the sole author of many of his books_”.[^69] Having set out the evidence being relied upon by the defence in justification for the statements in Annex A to E, I now explain why I could not agree that the evidential burden on that defence had been discharged.

> h.      **Ken’s Reaction to Esther:** First, Esther’s account appeared objectively incomplete. No mention was made by Esther as to whether she had any prior context with Edmund, such that she would immediately spring into action like that upon his complaint, and provide such completely candid and prompt updates repeatedly whenever he requested on information she received in her capacity within Popular Bookstore. After all, Edmund was not part of Popular Bookstore, and it would have been plainly apparent that he was effectively making a complaint against a fellow competing author. Next, there appeared to be disconnects in her account as well: Esther said she found Ken’s response during the meeting of 16 January 2019 to be “_evasive_” because he “_neither admitted nor denied the complaint that Anthony’s books were written by his students_”. However, an objective review of Ken’s response – as recounted by Esther herself – would find that Ken actually did address the issue directly. Given the context which Esther described for that meeting, i.e. that she had already told Ken earlier exactly what Edmund had alleged and Ken was supposed to provide an update at that meeting after checking with Anthony on the allegation, Ken’s response to Esther and Seah that “_in the publishing industry, normally the contents of a book were written by a team of people and that only the most prominent author_ **_in the team_** _would be featured and named as author of the book_” was objectively clear in addressing the issue. That response confirmed that Anthony did write the books because he was in the team. At most, the only concession being made in that response was that unspecified others were also involved together with Anthony in writing the books. Esther’s willingness to conclude evasiveness from that response did not appear fully comprehensible; and if Esther’s conclusion was based instead on Ken’s casual manner and the smile he made at the beginning, then our usual caution applied about conclusions based purely on interpretations of demeanour. Indeed, there was nothing offered up in Esther’s account which afforded any basis to safely conclude that her demeanour interpretations of Ken were superior and reliable. Further, if Esther did indeed think that the “_issue was unresolved_” given Ken’s response, and that all the books might have to be returned, then the next disconnect in her account was her willingness to nonetheless “_consider keeping some of the best-selling titles_” and her arbitrary selection of only 6 titles based on sales volume. There was no need to consider such a ‘keep-some-to-sell’ solution and proceed to drill down to an arbitrary number if indeed the issue was unresolved and a reconfirmation was actually required. After all, if the issue was indeed unresolved, a reconfirmation could have possibly resulted in an endorsement that all titles were written by Anthony, or a greater number than the arbitrary 6 which she selected – those possibilities would have more adequately catered for the profit considerations which she alluded to. That those possibilities appeared to have been entirely discounted by Esther at that point when she embarked on that ‘keep-some-to-sell’ solution did not appear to make any sense. In Esther’s account, she was effectively arriving at a solution even before getting the question resolved. That Esther was doing exactly that can also be seen in her incongruous inaction after receiving Ken’s allegedly re-confirmatory email on 18 January 2019. In that email, Ken simply stated that the 6 titles she selected “_are authored by Anthony_”, and nothing more was said as to whether others/students were also involved with Anthony in writing those 6 titles (or the balance 14). Objectively, the only possible issue left outstanding given Esther’s account was whether unqualified students were also responsible for some/all of the content in the 6 titles which she selected. If that was really her concern and which she wanted reconfirmation on, then Esther’s ready abandon of the issue given Ken’s simple email and her inaction in probing it further did not make any sense. Either the issue was still pending, or it was actually resolved and there were other considerations which drove Esther and company towards adopting that ‘keep-some-to-sell’ solution at what appeared to be an entirely premature stage. Those incongruous gaps in Esther’s account were troubling and they gave hint that there was more context about what actually happened and which was not in her account. Before me, Esther was probed on all of those areas in cross-examination, and she did not impress as a witness who had a firm grasp over her account, nor a completely objective one, because instead of engaging confidently to substantively address the coherence issues in her account, she opted to continuously refer to her AEIC so as to recite the details in that flawed narrative. This meant that the areas of concern in her account remained. Additionally, Esther was:

>> i.       reticent when probed on whether there was a context to her dealings with Edmund given that Edmund’s wife, Linda, was then the personal assistant to Esther’s ultimate boss, Mr Chou, Group CEO of Popular Bookstore, and Linda was then actively updating Mr Chou on the matter[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70);

>> ii.       curiously partisan in stating that it was “_impossible_” that Edmund could have had an ulterior motive in making the complaint against a fellow competing author[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71), and that it was also “_impossible_” that Linda might speak to Mr Chou about the complaint if it was not handled properly by her[^72];

>> iii.       inconsistent when she contradicted her AEIC and conceded that Ken’s smile could have been innocuous and simply in exasperation[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73);

>> iv.       inconsistent when she contradicted her AEIC and disclaimed responsibility for the ‘keep-some-to-sell’ solution as being completely Seah’s idea instead[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74), and that beyond the account stated in her AEIC, she could not remember what else Seah said at the meeting and what else Ken said at the meeting[^75];

>> v.       inconsistent when she contradicted her AEIC and said that the actual reason for embarking on that title restriction exercise was because Seah felt that “_Anthony had published too many books_”[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76);

>> vi.       inconsistent when she contradicted her AEIC and said that she “_never_” told Edmund that 14 titles from Anthony were being withdrawn from sale by Popular Bookstore, only to correct herself and revert to the account in her AEIC after referring to it again[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77); and

>> vii.       inconsistent when she contradicted her AEIC and said that she told Edmund in her update to him on 1 February 2019 that the 6 titles were chosen because of sales – with seemingly no mention being made about those 6 titles being chosen because of authorship confirmation[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78).

> All of those features in Esther’s delivery performance in court raised further concerns about the credibility of her account. Additionally, the cross-examination also revealed that Esther was actually then very new to her appointment (just 2 weeks in) and did not have any experience dealing with such complaints before.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) Bearing in mind that this was a witness who was still employed at Popular Bookstore, and whose actions and decisions from that period had resulted in significant repercussions all round which went beyond just revenue, her inability to fully explain the adequacy and coherence for her actions and decisions was most unsatisfactory. There was also something more fundamentally problematic for the defence in Esther’s account. Esther’s concession that there was another reason for restricting the titles being sold was particularly alarming since that reason had nothing to do with authorship. That concession effectively threw serious doubt over whether it could still be said that Esther’s account established that the 14 books were removed from sale because Popular Bookstore had found that they were written by Anthony’s students. After a careful review of Esther’s testimony where she addressed her AEIC, I found that Esther’s account no longer established that proposition. In its final presented form, all Esther confirmed was that when she sought to investigate Edmund’s complaint, she received inconclusive answers about the authorship of 14 books and which she did not probe further, and that the title restriction could have been for another reason entirely unconnected to authorship. This result had serious implications on the defence because Esther’s testimony formed the sole independent evidence being claimed as affording justification for Edmund’s defamatory statements in Annex A to E. After all, if Esther did not conclude that the 14 books were written by Anthony’s students, then there was no way that Edmund could have relied upon anything which Esther told him as justifying his making statements to that effect. Indeed, during Esther’s testimony, Esther confirmed that she did not so conclude, and that she never told Edmund that the 14 titles were withdrawn because they were written by Anthony’s students.[^80] Even Edmund himself also conceded this during his cross-examination.[^81] Given the state of Esther’s evidence, with all the coherence issues remaining unaddressed, together with the delivery flaws added, and with its final presented form, I found that it did not amount to evidence which justified Edmund embarking on his defamatory allegations in Annex A to E. I now move on to the next evidential limb which Edmund claimed reliance on.

> i.      **Ken’s Reaction to Edmund:** To recap, Edmund said that after he learnt from Esther that she was about to meet up with Ken on 16 January 2019, he called and told Ken that he had lodged the complaint to Popular Bookstore. That call ended with them “_wanting to catch up with each other socially at Edmund’s residence the next day_”.[\[note: 82\]](#Ftn_82) Ken did meet Edmund as scheduled on 17 January 2019, and Edmund said that he reiterated to Ken that he had made the complaint to Popular Bookstore, and he asked Ken how his meeting with Popular Bookstore went, but Ken “_did not answer his question, and also did not deny the complaint_”.[^83] Edmund then decided not to pursue it further. With that briefest of descriptions of a seemingly socially awkward meeting, Edmund then claimed reliance on this interaction as providing justification for his embarking on those defamatory allegations in Annex A to E. I could not agree for two principal reasons. First, this evidential limb was never pleaded in the Defence and it was just introduced late in Edmund’s AEIC. Second, even if the meeting did take place in the manner alleged, I could not see how Ken’s silent reaction under those circumstances amounted to unambiguous evidence that some of Anthony’s books were written by his students. Objectively, Ken’s silent reaction to Edmund afforded a whole host of possible interpretations, not all of which were as the defence contended. No succour was therefore to be had for the defence on this count. I now move on to the final evidential limb which Edmund claimed reliance on.

> j.      **Anthony’s Reaction to Edmund in the Further Phone Call:** To recap, Edmund said that he called and spoke with Anthony on 18 January 2019, “_to inform him that I had made the complaint \[to Popular Bookstore\] because I did not want students’ performance in the subject to be adversely affected by the usage of Anthony’s books which contained many conceptual errors._ **_Anthony expressed his understanding and told me that he bore no grudge against me._** _We then went on to chat casually. …_” (**emphasis** added).[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84) With that briefest of descriptions, Edmund then claimed reliance on this interaction as also providing justification for his embarking on those defamatory allegations in Annex A to E. I could not agree for three principal reasons. First, this evidential limb, like before, was never pleaded in the Defence and it was just introduced late in Edmund’s AEIC. Second, I found the account itself doubtful: that a repeated fraudster of an author would have readily made such an implied confession to his meddling competitor of an accuser, before going on to have an extended pleasant conversation about inconsequential niceties after a confrontation like that. Finally, even if the recount of Anthony’s reaction was accurate, I could not see how Anthony’s reaction under those alleged circumstances amounted to unambiguous evidence that some of Anthony’s books were written by his students. Objectively, that claimed reaction by Anthony was quite non-committal and afforded a host of possible interpretations, not all of which were as the defence contended. No succour was therefore to be had for the defence on this count either.

> k.      **Conclusion on Whether the Defence of Justification was Established for the Defamatory Allegations in Annex A to E:** Given the state of the three categories of evidence being claimed by the defence as offering proof of the defamatory allegations, I found serious coherence concerns with each of them for all the reasons stated. I found the evidence doubtful and there was no basis to conclude that the defence had discharged its evidential burden in establishing the justification defence for all of the defamatory allegations made by the defendants in Annex A to E. It again bears repeating that the law not only requires the defence to provide proof in justification, but where the allegations were serious, then correspondingly stronger proof was required: _Qingdao_ at \[169\]. This result meant that all of the defamatory allegations about the plaintiffs in Annex A to E remained unproven and were therefore patently false. Edmund’s actions in publishing those defamatory falsehoods had no defence in justification.

### \- The Flaws in the Qualified Privilege Defence:

39     The final defence being claimed for the 2019 actions was that of qualified privilege. The defence claimed it in these terms: that “_as a highly reputable and responsible economics tuition teacher, Edmund has an interest in and duty and responsibility to alert and inform_” the respective recipients of his utterance and publications in Annex A to E, and those recipients had a corresponding interest in receiving those reports. Edmund claimed that his “_sole intention of and objective in doing so was, (1) to ensure that the general public in Singapore and, in particular, students of the subject of economics, do not use or rely on economics textbooks which were authored by someone lacking the requisite professional knowledge and qualifications in the subject of economics; and (2) to maintain, uphold and promote the professional standards of tutors in Singapore, as well as the reputation and standing of, and public trust and confidence in, the tutoring profession in Singapore_”.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85)

40     The law in relation to the defence of qualified privilege has already been set out at \[33\] above. To recap, when a qualified privilege defence is claimed, the law requires the defence to prove that the defendants had a recognised legal/social/moral interest/duty to publish those statements about the plaintiffs to those recipients, and that those recipients had a corresponding reciprocal interest/duty to receive that information: _Golden Season_ at \[89\]. The privilege to issue defamatory statements about others without incurring liability for defamation was qualified on the basis that it attached only to the occasion where because of the existence of that relationship between the defendants and the recipients, it gave rise to that interest/duty to make those statements; and for this reason, the defence of qualified privilege normally only attached to the private communications made between parties on those occasions where that interest/duty existed: _Golden Season_ at \[88\].

41     In applying the law to the facts in the present case, I acknowledged that the utterance, and the publications in Annex A and B were all instances of private communication between the defendants to those respective recipients. I acknowledged as well the defence’s further explanation that a ‘high degree of moral and social responsibility was expected from authors to ensure that their books were of an acceptable standard because their books were being relied upon by students whose future were affected by that reliance, and who were thus particularly vulnerable and had to be protected from exploitation for commercial gain’.[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) Even with all of those points considered, the law has never granted immunity for defendants to embark on such self-righteous crusades before with recipients who had no pre-existing legally recognized social/moral relationship with those defendants to receive such statements. I came to this conclusion after reviewing all the authorities cited by the parties in their bundles; none of those authorities recognized that immunity ought to be granted in such cases. Instead, the authorities indicate that immunity does not arise where the defendant defames the plaintiff due to a subjective view that it was in the general welfare of society for those defamatory statements to be made: _Golden Season_ at \[89\]-\[90\].

42     Turning next to the defamatory Facebook publications in Annex C to E, which were not private communications, my earlier observations at \[33\] applied here with equal force, i.e. that the defence of qualified privilege has never been held to apply in cases such as the present where the defendants publicly broadcast defamatory statements about the plaintiffs indiscriminately to any and all recipients in the entire world through its Facebook account on a perpetual and open-ended occasion on the basis of some self-perceived social/moral interest/duty to save that world from engaging the services of the plaintiffs. Like before, the defence was effectively inviting this court to lay down new caselaw to extend this defence of qualified privilege to this exact scenario, and I did not for similar reasons, find grounds to do so. The only additional points which needed to be made here about Edmund’s claim were the following:

> a.     That Edmund’s claim of acting pursuant to any self-perceived social/moral duty was doubtful given his long period of inaction from January 2018 (when he first allegedly became concerned about the quality of Anthony’s books), till January 2019 when action was finally taken (which was sparked off by his discovery of Anthony’s possible influence over the distribution of his book). I had alluded to all of this earlier at \[38a\].

> b.     That Edmund’s claim of acting pursuant to any self-perceived social/moral duty was doubtful since all those impugned books had already been withdrawn for several months by that stage when he chose to revive the issue again just before exam season. When Edmund was questioned on this, he explained that the revival was sparked by ‘concerns for student welfare after 2 parents approached him around that period to ask for his views on the withdrawn books’. This explanation was objectively doubtful because those parents, in Edmund’s own account, had apparently bought those books for several months and not even referred to them yet. Even if that conveniently unverifiable account was accepted, Edmund’s subsequent actions in going beyond that group by targeting (1) Anthony’s fellow members in the Association of Tutors (Singapore), and (2) Popular Bookstore again with his complaint simply did not cohere with a genuine professed concern for parental and student welfare.

> c.     That Edmund’s claim of acting pursuant to any self-perceived social/moral duty was doubtful given that those duties would have been reasonably and completely discharged by reciting the information accurately and purely without all the extra irrelevant embellishments, some of which were patently falsely and/or inaccurately stated by Edmund. For instance, when Edmund revived the issue in September 2019, it could no longer be said to be ‘_recent_’, the averment that Anthony had published his twenty books ‘_in a short span of a few months_’ was false and irrelevant[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87), and the averment about Anthony’s lack of relevant university credentials had no relevance by that stage. If indeed Edmund felt that Anthony was truly ‘remorseful’ over the saga, then there was really no need to say much more than that caution was advised before one uses any of the 14 books as they had been withdrawn due to concerns over the quality of their content. Almost everything else which Edmund added into his publications in Annex A to E appeared to have been entirely gratuitous and set in language intended to sensationalise the issue.

> d.     That Edmund’s claim of acting pursuant to any self-perceived social/moral duty was doubtful given that Anthony was the only party to receive Edmund’s righteous actions when there were apparently other instances which Edmund claimed he knew of but where no such similarly righteous actions were taken.[\[note: 88\]](#Ftn_88)

> e.     Finally, as recounted earlier, there was no factual basis for Edmund to arrive at those averments about the plaintiffs, and this was so fundamental a failure that the question of granting privilege does not even rise to be considered.

43     For all the reasons stated, I therefore did not find that the defence of qualified privilege had any application, or scope for application, in this case.

### \- Conclusion on the 2019 utterance, emails, and Facebook posts:

44     Having reviewed the natural and ordinary meanings of the words in the 2019 utterance, emails and Facebook posts, I found that they were clearly defamatory of the plaintiffs. A review of the evidence being offered up by the defence also found them to be seriously flawed and objectively doubtful. As a result, the evidential burden on the defence was not discharged and none of the claimed defences were ever established. The defendants therefore remained fully liable for their defamation.

45     Before turning to the issue of damages, I will conclude this section by setting out briefly what the evidence indicated as having taken place instead between the parties, before turning to address the related tort of malicious falsehood which the plaintiffs also pleaded.

### \- What the Evidence Indicated Instead:

46     In contrast to the evidence offered up by the defence, the evidence offered up by the plaintiffs did not suffer any of the same flaws or coherence issues. I acknowledged that Anthony, Ken and Christopher were not strictly uninterested and independent, but having observed them in court as they were being questioned on their accounts, I formed the view that they were forthright and that their accounts were credible. I came to this conclusion because a review of their testimony will find each to be complete and coherent against the background of objective facts. Each was also fully supported by contemporaneous messages from that period. Though each was questioned vigorously on their accounts, none recanted, and all remained confidently consistent on the material points. For these reasons, I accepted that their accounts accurately set out what actually happened between the parties instead. I now recount the material parts chronologically so as to complete the factual findings in these Grounds:

> a.     The factual divergence between the parties starts at the point when Edmund first contacted Christopher on 11 January 2019. Christopher described that phone call at \[34\] onwards in his AEIC. Christopher stated that Edmund was angry at finding out that Anthony potentially had influence over the distribution of his book, and Edmund berated Christopher for not informing him earlier. Christopher’s attempts to placate and explain the situation were unsuccessful, and Edmund then demanded to meet Christopher and added “_that he intended to make a fuss over all of Anthony’s economics textbooks sold by Popular Bookstore and have them removed from the shelves_”. Christopher then told Edmund that he would meet him as demanded, and that he would arrange it subsequently.

> b.     Christopher was then on his way to see Anthony – to hand him the typeset manuscript for one of his latest books for his checking – and when he reached Anthony, Christopher said he updated Anthony on what happened earlier. Anthony then told Christopher that he would speak with Edmund directly on the issue and asked for Edmund’s contact number, which Christopher duly provided.

> c.     Anthony confirmed that after Christopher told him what happened, he did proceed to call Edmund that same day in order to clarify matters. Even though Anthony explained that he did not influence the distribution of Edmund’s book, and that he no longer held any shares in MarketAsia, Edmund remained angry. At one point, Edmund shouted and said that Anthony was a “_very stupid person_” and that his books were “_rubbish_”, “_repetitive and the same_” and not in Singapore’s A Level examination format.[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89) When Anthony tried to reason with Edmund on those points, Edmund then shouted “_how can you get your students to write such rubbish books?_” Anthony said he then stopped Edmund and said that a few of his former students only helped to edit and proof-read but played no part in writing the content.[^90] Edmund then said that there were mistakes in the content, and Anthony responded that he would review his books and correct them if there were any such mistakes. Anthony said Edmund continued shouting angrily and said that he would ‘take revenge on Anthony for distributing his book’ by telling Popular Bookstore that Anthony’s books were “_repeated and the same_”; Edmund then told Anthony to “_wait and see_” before abruptly ending the call.[^91] Anthony continued to try and be reconciliatory and later sent Edmund a text to reiterate the points he made and indicated that he hoped Edmund would calm down and find out the truth first. Anthony also indicated that he would be happy to answer any questions which Edmund may have, and that Edmund could call him at any time. After his call with Edmund, Anthony said he updated Christopher and Ken on what happened.

> d.     Later that same day, Christopher said he received a text message from Edmund stating that Anthony had just called him to “_talk rubbish_”. This was followed by another message some time later where Edmund told Christopher that he was terminating his distribution agreement with MarketAsia. After Christopher acknowledged that message, Edmund sent another message asking “_Are you free later? I am having beer later. On me :)_”. Christopher replied that he was unable to join Edmund due to prior plans, and Edmund then messaged that they could meet the following week to talk further. Edmund then ended by stating that “_My blood is boiling. Need some beer to cool it down :)_”[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92)

> e.     Christopher did subsequently receive the termination agreement from Edmund that same day. In that email, Edmund indicated that he was “_unwilling to have any business dealings with_” entities associated with Anthony.[\[note: 93\]](#Ftn_93)

> f.     Christopher, Anthony and Ken updated each other on what was happening. A copy of their chat logs are exhibited at FKH Tab 22 and 23 in Anthony’s Supplementary AEIC dated 24 September 2020. Those chat logs confirm Edmund’s anger over the distribution issue and the various efforts made by Anthony and the rest to candidly address Edmund’s concerns and meet his various demands.

> g.     Anthony confirmed that a few days later, on 13 January 2019, he received a missed call from Edmund. When Anthony called Edmund back, Anthony said Edmund sounded calmer and was less aggressive. They discussed the distribution issue again, and Anthony reiterated his explanations and also tried to strike a conciliatory tone by stating that he agreed with Edmund’s view that ‘he ought to have been notified at least out of courtesy’.[\[note: 94\]](#Ftn_94) They then talked about MarketAsia’s operations and Anthony shared what he knew. The call then ended with Edmund stating that it was already late, and he would not take too much of Anthony’s time. After the call, Anthony said he messaged Edmund to say that it was nice chatting with him, and that it was better to be friends than enemies. Anthony again offered to address any clarification which Edmund had. In response, Edmund sent two messages back stating that he still felt that the distribution saga was wrong, but he ‘could sense Anthony’s sincerity and remorse’ over that matter. Edmund also reminded Anthony ‘to review his books’ and that they could work together in future since Anthony was not such a bad person after all.[^95] Anthony explained that he did not see any need to respond to those messages.

> h.     Anthony confirmed though that he did call Ken and updated Ken on what he discussed with Edmund. The chat logs between Anthony, Ken and Christopher also confirmed the tone of the call between Anthony and Edmund on 13 January 2019, and that the three of them explored options to try and accede to Edmund’s demands for the termination and to find ways to pay Edmund the outstanding royalties.

> i.     The next day, Ken confirmed that he received a phone call from Esther on 14 January 2019, and that Esther told him that Edmund had made a complaint about Anthony’s books but Esther did not tell Ken exactly what the complaint was about. Esther then asked Ken to meet her on 16 January 2019, and he agreed. Subsequent to that phone call, Ken received a text message from Esther “asking for a list of books authored by Anthony”. Ken subsequently updated Anthony on the matter, and Ken’s message read: “_Sir, got call this morning from Popular Buyer to meet up this Wednesday. They want to find out what Edmund has complained about the books, she also said there is no complains so far after checking with outlet supervisors. She just hope to react fast if he really complains to the top. She also mentioned this is not to kick out anyone_”.[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96) Anthony then responded that he understood from his phone conversation with Edmund on 13 January 2019 that Edmund had probably complained about the rubbish quality of his books because of the alleged mistakes and that many were repeated, and so if “_she feel lousy, can remove_” because he “_don’t want make her difficult job also_” “_cos think she stuck in between_”. Anthony closed by stating to Ken: “_Sir, tmr if buyer in difficult position. Don’t fight._” Anthony then said he was ok to withdraw some titles and keep only a few at Popular Bookstore, and this was because he was ‘looking at the bigger picture and thinking longer term for CPD’.

> j.     Ken then recounted that on the day he was supposed to meet Esther, Edmund called him in the morning and propositioned him with a business opportunity in a new publishing venture which Edmund was apparently considering. Ken, already aware of what had happened in the prior few days, declined and just indicated that he was about to retire. Ken said that Edmund then propositioned him with a job offer at Popular Bookstore because his wife was in a “_high level position_” in Popular Bookstore. Ken gave a similar non-committal response so as not to antagonize Edmund. Ken then said Edmund invited him over to his condo the next day and Ken agreed. After the call, Edmund followed up with a message to Ken which read: “_Ken, do not let Anthony make you or MarketAsia the scapegoat for his wrongdoings. I will let you hear the recording on how he admitted that his books were of low quality but blamed the sale of the books in Popular Bookstore on MarketAsia_”.[\[note: 97\]](#Ftn_97) Unsure as to how to respond to that bizarre message, Ken said he simply typed “_Ok sure, thanks_”. Ken then proceeded to meet up with Esther.

> k.     Ken confirmed that Seah was present at the meeting with Esther on 16 January 2019. Seah told Ken that no complaints have been received about Anthony’s books so far, and that Edmund was the only one to lodge a complaint. Seah explained that it was important to protect the interests of both Popular Bookstore and CPD, and they were concerned with placating Edmund as Edmund’s wife was the personal assistant to the CEO of Popular Bookstore, and Seah did not want the CEO to get involved in the matter as she was worried that it would create trouble for her and Esther. With that context, Seah then told Ken that Edmund had complained that Anthony’s textbooks were not written by Anthony. Although Ken was hearing that allegation for the first time, he explained that he was not surprised because he felt that Edmund disliked Anthony and was trying to sabotage the sales of Anthony’s books. Seah then asked Ken if he knew which titles were not written by Anthony because Edmund did not specify them in his complaint. Ken said he was unable to answer. Ken said that the meeting then moved on to the ‘keep-some-to-sell’ solution as described by Esther in her account because the aim was to pacify Edmund.[\[note: 98\]](#Ftn_98) Ken explained that he agreed to go along with that solution given Anthony’s prior instructions to him not to place Esther and Seah in a difficult position as they were stuck in between.

> l.     After the meeting, Ken updated Anthony. Their chat logs again showed Anthony instructing Ken to “_Let Edmund win, don’t give buyer headache_” and that he agreed to withdraw some titles and keep the most profitable few as “_we don’t want buyer to be stuck in a difficult position between popular chairman PA and buyer and us. Let everyone be peaceful_.” Anthony continued that he was thinking long term survival for CPD and that he “_want Popular to be happy and Edmund to win. Important. He needs to win. Because if he doesn’t win, he will do more to win._”[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99) All that then resulted in Ken’s brief email to Esther and Seah on 18 January 2019.

47     In their testimonies, Christopher, Anthony, and Ken also alluded to other matters in their dealings with Edmund and how those were consistent with their assessment that Edmund was being malicious. I do not intend to recount those further here given my findings that all three were credible on the key events already recounted:

> ■    that Edmund was very angry over the distribution issue;

> ■    that Edmund had concluded that Anthony was guilty of trying to unfairly compete;

> ■    that Edmund had uttered threats in anger to take revenge by having Anthony’s many ‘rubbish repeated and the same books’ taken off the shelves at Popular Bookstore;

> ■    that Edmund was prepared to use all means necessary to do so, and had sent contrived and cryptic messages to build up his case;

> ■    that although Anthony tried to appease Edmund, Anthony never made the alleged admission to Edmund, and

> ■    that Esther and Seah were more concerned about placating Edmund, and that their “investigations” actually did not result in independent evidence that 14 books from Anthony were written by Anthony’s students instead.

All of those points confirmed that the defence case was artificially constructed and deserved to be dismissed in its entirety.

## III. Tort of malicious falsehood:

48     Apart from grounding their action in the tort of defamation, the plaintiffs also invoked the tort of malicious falsehood as part of its case. The invocation of this additional tort appeared to have been included either out of an abundance of caution, and/or as a matter of tactical convenience. I say this because the tort actually adds nothing to the plaintiffs’ case. It appeared to have been included because the central element of the tort, i.e. malice, coincides with the response which the plaintiffs would have mounted in order to defeat the defences of fair comment and qualified privilege being claimed by the defendants. For the reasons already set out earlier, I found that those defences failed on their own lack of merit. Given that liability under the tort of defamation had already been established, there was therefore no practical reason to examine the tort of malicious falsehood which covers much of the same ground. This was because the court will not permit a double recovery of damages even if liability under both torts were established.

49     There was one more reason to be brief in addressing this additional tort. I found that the plaintiffs did not place enough focus on establishing causation between the false statement alleged to have been maliciously published by the defendants, and the damages suffered by them as a result; such causation being one of the three elements of the tort: 1. publication of a false statement by the defendants about the plaintiff, his business; 2. that the defendants made that statement maliciously, and 3. that the plaintiffs suffered actual damage as the direct and natural result of the publication (i.e. causation).[\[note: 100\]](#Ftn_100) To succeed in malicious falsehood, special damages therefore have to be made out.[^101] All this was not done, and it was no answer to rely on the provisions in the Defamation Act which state that special damages need not be specifically proved as those provisions relate to the tort of defamation instead.

50     I now turn to the issue of damages for the defamation.

## IV.   If liability was established, what would be the proper quantum of damages which ought to be awarded?

51     The plaintiffs submitted that a sum of $250,000/- ought to be awarded to them jointly and severally as global damages.[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102) The defendants declined to state a figure and submitted instead that the sum ‘ought not to fall within the higher end of the spectrum for non-politician plaintiffs’.[^103] After due consideration of the submissions and authorities, I stated the following in my oral remarks on damages when I delivered my decision:

> _A review of the cases guides the quantum of damages payable in the present case, with adjustments being made for the_ **_nature and gravity_** _of the defamation, the_ **_mode and extent_** _of their publication, the conduct_, **_position and standing_** _of the parties (plus areas of_ **_overlap_**_), and the_ **_conduct_** _during these proceedings._

52     I now expand on those remarks. First, in relation to the **position and standing** of the parties, it was beyond dispute – as noted earlier in these Grounds – that the evidence indicated that both Anthony and Edmund, and their respective tuition centres, were widely known in the private tuition sector in Singapore. Both were also accomplished authors for books targeted at students taking economics at A Levels. For Anthony, apart from his business interests in the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs, he also had other business interests and also held a range of appointments with various community institutions – all were not directly related to his tutoring and authorship activities. I shall not recount those further as I did not consider those other interests and activities of his to be directly relevant under this section given the nature of the defamation under consideration. There was also no evidence presented before me that those other interests and activities were adversely impacted by the tortious actions. In summary, the position and standing of the parties indicated that both were credible tutors who enjoyed significant standing and influence in the community on account of their work as private tutors in the subject of A Levels Economics. The words and actions of such individuals are therefore weightier on those counts.

53     As for CPD, I accepted that the evidence also indicated that it too enjoyed a good reputation as a publisher within the local education community. Apart from handling the publication of all titles from Anthony, CPD also successfully handled the publication and distribution of texts from other authors; all this reinforced the point about its reputation. In Esther’s uncontroverted testimony, it was also confirmed that prior to the incidents in 2019, CPD did enjoy a good working relationship with Popular Bookstore and had distributed its texts with them without any major issue.

54     Given that standing of the parties, I found the **nature and gravity of the defamation** to be serious as they related to the very foundation of that standing. To recap, the two 2017 website posts by the defendants explicitly denigrated the repute, competence, knowledge, skill, ability and credentials of the 1st plaintiff as an economics tutor (and by extension, the 2nd plaintiffs as well). The **mode and extent** of their publication was also aggravated since the 2017 website posts were targeted to the world at large, and there was undisputed evidence that the defendants had taken steps to promote their website. The 2017 website posts invite all to conclude that the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are far from being the ‘Best Tutor’ and cannot even be considered a ‘Good Economics Tutor’. Even now, those 2017 website posts continue to remain on the defendants’ website, and that long duration will need to be accounted for. Turning next to the 2019 defamatory statements, I found them to be even more serious as they explicitly denigrated the honesty, integrity, and professionalism of the plaintiffs in their conduct as tutors, authors and publishers. The mode and extent of the publication in 2019 was also far more aggravated because they were not simply passively targeted to the world at large but was actively promoted to their attention; apart from the 3,000 plus Facebook followers who received it, the baseless accusations also reached an undisclosed further number after it was made into a Sponsored Post by the defendants. By 26 September 2019, that Sponsored Post had attracted more than 1,600 “reactions”, 14 explicit comments which were negative against the plaintiffs, and had been republished by various Facebook users 42 times.[\[note: 104\]](#Ftn_104) Direct emails were also employed by the defendants to further increase the circulation of its averments. So serious were the defamatory averments that even the Group CEO of Popular Bookstore was led to believe that the 1st and 3rd plaintiffs were possibly guilty of fraud and deceit. In the end, none of the defamatory averments from 2017 and 2019 were proven to have any factual basis in truth, but the harm had already been done. The loss of goodwill with Popular Bookstore was beyond serious argument. The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs also produced evidence to indicate a drastic drop in revenue of about $100,000/- for Q4 in 2019 (compared to the corresponding Q4 in the three preceding years) after Edmund revived his alleged admission in September 2019 and published it indiscriminately to the world at large.[^105]

55     In relation to the **conduct** of the defendants, I noted that they have taken no steps whatsoever to mitigate the impact of their defamatory statements. In fact, the 2017 website posts and the 2019 Facebook posts remain till date. No apology was offered from start till date. The evidence also indicated that Edmund took steps to exacerbate the situation by arranging for the Facebook Post to become a Sponsored Post with additional sensational embellishments after receiving Anthony’s legal demand to cease and desist. The plaintiffs invited this court to award exemplary damages because it was submitted that Edmund was motivated by profit.[\[note: 106\]](#Ftn_106) I did not come to that conclusion on the evidence, and I now expand on my oral remarks on this point. If Edmund was cynically motivated by profit, then one would expect to see other actions consistent with that motivation – but I could not identify any before me. Only Anthony appeared to be the subject of Edmund’s negative attention, and I found that the evidence hinted at some other motivation instead. The evidence indicated that by the time Edmund embarked on his statements about Anthony in 2017, Edmund was already a reputable tutor and author in his own right with significant material success. Edmund’s cross-examination also revealed how he triumphed over substantial personal challenges to achieve that success. It was all through hard work, and Edmund deservedly takes pride in that. The circumstances also indicated that it was around that same period that Anthony’s fame and acclaim rose. In contrast to Edmund’s personal experiences on how he achieved his success, it appeared as if Edmund took issue with how he understood Anthony as having achieved his success instead, i.e. through extensive and slick marketing. Given his personal experiences, it appeared as if all that galled Edmund, i.e. that another could achieve success through some other means without all the seeming effort which he himself went through. The inclination to measure the worth of others against one’s own experiences is strong. Less strong is the objectivity to conclude only after reviewing all the facts. This coheres with the evidence about Edmund’s reaction in 2019 where he basically flew off the handle after finding out that Anthony had acquired possible influence over the distribution of his book. Even though there was no evidence at all that his book’s distribution had been adversely affected, it was apparent that Edmund had already concluded that Anthony, a tutor whom he believed had achieved his success through other means, was trying to gain further success as a publisher through similar other means as well. I would accept that there was not enough overall for this court to safely conclude one way or the other as to which was more probable – and that really disposes the point that exemplary damages are due.

56     It was a different matter when it came to **aggravated damages** though. The defendants’ conduct cited earlier all justified an award of aggravated damages for the extra hurt and distress caused by the defendants when they took those further actions to unjustifiably repeat and exacerbate the defamation plus widen the extent of its publication.[\[note: 107\]](#Ftn_107) All those actions appeared to have been actuated by malice – as were his actions in 2019 in general. This was apparent from the fact that none of the defences raised at trial were founded on credible evidence. The defence case advanced was also not even supported by the law in this area. Even after all this was pointed out to the defence in my oral remarks, and a pause granted to the parties to digest the outcome of the trial, there was still no concession and no effort to take responsibility for the plainly defamatory effect of the defendants’ words. For individuals who are capable of but have lost insight into their actions and who display no desire for objectivity to regain it back, then there ought to be a clear signal that there are consequences for that unreasonable obstinance.

57     I reviewed the cases cited by the plaintiffs in seeking damages of $250,000. All of them involved unreported decisions, and far smaller awards of damages. I did not see any as providing justification for the figure sought. What could usefully be gleaned from the cases were however the following general pointers:

> ■    For one-off defamatory instances involving averments of fraud and dishonesty against a party of some standing where the extent of the publication was restricted to a small group, then damages in the sum of about $20,000 may be appropriate: _Teo Poh Siang & anor v Ong Hock Kim_[\[note: 108\]](#Ftn_108) where the 1st plaintiff was a property consultant, author of a book on Strata Management in Singapore, and the managing director of his own property company – which company also stood as the 2nd plaintiff in the suit. After the defendant there failed to be shortlisted for a tender, the defendant made defamatory statements at an MCST council meeting that the plaintiffs were fraudulent, dishonest and guilty of improper conduct. The court found the conduct of the defendant had shown him to be a trouble-maker and awarded the 1st plaintiff $20,000 as general damages and $5,000 as aggravated damages, whilst the 2nd plaintiff was awarded $5,000 as general damages.

> ■    Where the extent of the publication was more extensive by virtue of the defamatory averments being placed on a website to target the world at large, correspondingly higher awards of damages would be justified: _Andreas Wimmer & anor v James Donald Filgo_[\[note: 109\]](#Ftn_109) where the defendant published an article on the website alleging, amongst others, that the 1st plaintiff (a businessman involved in private security in Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore) was of a dishonest character, had fabricated his _curriculum vitae_ and was involved in business scams, and that the 2nd plaintiff (wife of the 1st plaintiff) was the owner of a company which was involved in fraud and other criminal conduct. The defendant ignored the legal demand to cease and desist, but ultimately had default judgment entered against him. The 1st plaintiff was awarded $60,000 for injury to reputation and $30,000 in aggravated damages, and the 2nd plaintiff was awarded $30,000 for injury to reputation and $30,000 in aggravated damages.

58     Turning to the cases cited by the defence, I found the following case to be coherent with the observations made earlier:

> ■     _Golden Season Pte Ltd & Ors v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd & Anor._ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 38</span> where the defamation concerned a Facebook post, a phone text message, and a chain of emails published by the defendants to various authorities alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in malpractices which caused donor moneys to be used unwisely and the plaintiffs were guilty of copyright infringement. The 1st plaintiff was a company of some 30 years and was well-known for its involvement in charity work. The court awarded $15,000 in general damages to the 1st plaintiff and $30,000 as general damages and $20,000 as aggravated damages to the 3rd plaintiff (who was the sales director in the 1st plaintiffs).

59     All the other cases cited by the parties were distinguishable on their facts, and shall not be recounted further, bar one: _Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor_ \[2001\]1 SLR(R) 86[\[note: 110\]](#Ftn_110) (“_Arul Chandran_”).

60     The defendants cited _Arul Chandran_ as offering useful guidance as to where the damages ought to be pegged in the present case, and I agreed. The facts in that case were briefly as follows: the plaintiff there was a lawyer of more than 30 years standing and was then holding appointment as Vice-President of the Tanglin Club. The defendant portrayed the plaintiff to be extremely vicious and a dangerous fraud who was incapable of discharging his duties in a fair and honest manner. Those defamatory averments were published in three letters to the President and Committee Members at the club. The plaintiff was awarded $100,000 as general damages and $50,000 as aggravated damages. This case, though a little dated, indicated that whilst the extent of the publication will be catered for, the plaintiffs in the present case will nonetheless need to moderate their expectations as to what was due to them on account of their position and standing.

61     After making those adjustments for the position and standing of the parties in the present case, I considered that the appropriate starting point for an award in general damages to the 1st plaintiff given the nature and gravity of the defamation in the 2017 website posts and the extent of their publication should be in the region of about $30,000; and in respect of the more serious nature and gravity of the defamation in the 2019 instances plus the far wider extent of their publication, that the appropriate starting point for an award in general damages there should be in the region of $60,000. Individually, those sums would have been entirely consistent with the cases recounted, but cumulatively, those sums would have resulted in the total being a little generous. I also considered that there was some overlap between the events and the interests involved and therefore made an adjustment downwards of $10,000 – bringing the total award in general damages for the 1st plaintiff in this case to $80,000. Given the conduct of the defendants as recounted earlier where steps were taken deliberately to exacerbate the defamation, and the stance adopted by the defendants up until judgment was entered, I considered that a sum of $40,000 was justified as aggravated damages for the 1st plaintiff. I found that sum to be consistent with the sums awarded by the courts as aggravated damages in the cases recounted.

62     Turning next to the 2nd plaintiff, after making the requisite adjustments for the position and standing of the parties involved, I considered that the appropriate starting point for an award in general damages to the 2nd plaintiff given the nature and gravity of the defamation in the 2017 website posts and the extent of their publication should be in the region of about $15,000; whilst the appropriate starting point for an award in general damages given the more serious nature and gravity of the defamation in the 2019 instances and the far wider extent of their publication to be in the region of about $30,000. Individually, those sums would have been entirely consistent with the cases recounted. I acknowledged though that there was a substantial overlap in interests between the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs and that a considerable downwards adjustment ought to be made so as avoid double recovery. In the end, I found that a final award of $25,000 in general damages to the 2nd plaintiff would be appropriate.

63     Finally, for the 3rd plaintiff, after making the requisite adjustments for the position and standing of the parties involved, I considered that the appropriate starting point for an award in general damages to the 3rd plaintiff given serious nature and gravity of the defamation in the 2019 instances and the far wider extent of their publication to be in the region of about $30,000. No award was due for the 2017 website posts since they did not reference the 3rd plaintiffs. I acknowledged that there was some overlap in the interests between the 1st and 3rd plaintiffs – albeit the overlap was smaller compared with the 2nd plaintiff because the 3rd plaintiff’s business extended wider and catered for authors beyond the 1st plaintiff. In the end, I found that a final award of $25,000 in general damages to the 3rd plaintiff would be appropriate.

64     No awards in special damages were made given that the evidence offered up by the plaintiffs on this area did not in my judgment condescend to the requisite detail to establish causation.

## Conclusion:

65     In summary, the awards made for the defamation were as follows:

> ■    1st Plaintiff: general damages of $80,000/- and aggravated damages of $40,000/-

> ■    2nd Plaintiffs: general damages of $25,000/-

> ■    3rd Plaintiffs: general damages of $25,000/-

In the round, I found these sums in the final outcome to be appropriate as convincing signals that vindicate the reputation of the plaintiffs, and to provide consolation for the 1st plaintiff for the personal distress and hurt experienced. To a lesser extent, they served as reparation for the damages caused. Final judgment was accordingly entered in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendants in those sums above together with statutory interest. The plaintiffs’ costs plus disbursements in these proceedings were also ordered to be taxed if they were not agreed. The defendants being dissatisfied with the judgment have since filed an appeal.

##### **Annex A:** Email dated 7 September 2019 sent by Edmund from his EC email account to (1) the Association of Tutors (Singapore), (2) to various local schools; and (3) to various local teachers.

Hi,

It was recently brought to my attention that of the approximately twenty books that Anthony Fok published in a short span of a year or so, most were written by his students. As I believe that such books may do the students more harm than good, as his students may not have a good grasp of the key economic concepts, I decided to report the case to Popular Bookstore.

Before I reported the case to Popular Bookstore, I spoke with Anthony Fok. He admitted to me that he made a grave mistake by asking his students to write the books. He also claimed that his former economics teachers had advised him against publishing such books, although he did not heed their advice. Anthony Fok asked me to give him some time for the current copies to sell out and he would then revise the contents of all the books. I told him that it would not be good for students and I would report the case to Popular Bookstore and let them decide the best way to deal with the case.

Popular Bookstore subsequently verified the fact with Anthony Fok. Anthony Fok did not dispute the fact, except that some of the twenty books were written by himself. Popular Bookstore has since taken down the books.

It was also brought to my attention that several members of the association of tutors have known about this for a long time but did not take any action.

**Professional Code of Conduct For Tutors**

(http://www.ats.org.sg/code-of-conduct/)

The role of the Association of Tutors (Singapore) is to establish and promote professional standards, to support the continuing professional development of tutors and to promote tutoring as a profession.

This will help to maintain public trust and confidence in the tutoring profession in Singapore. The following are guidelines to support and provide a direction for our tutors.

Tutors should:

> 1.     act with honesty and integrity in all aspects of their work

> 2.     act to uphold the reputation and standing of the profession

Warmest Regards,

The above is an unfortunate episode for everyone, particularly for students. In order to prevent such an incident and other similar bad ones from recurring, I wonder whether it would help if Popular Bookstore puts in place some sort of vetting system before the books are placed on the shelves. Having such as a system \[_sic_\] will not only help consumers, it will also make Popular Bookstore which is a great organization, in my view, even greater.

##### **Annex C:** The Facebook post of 9 September 2019 published by Edmund on EC’s public facing Facebook page.

Anthony Fok, who is an economics tutor in Singapore, published about twenty books in a short span of a year or so. Recently, to our astonishment, it was brought to our attention most of the books \[sic\] were written by his students. As we believed that such books were likely to do students more harm than good, as his students were unlikely to have a thorough understanding of the key economic concepts, we decided to report the case to Popular Bookstore.

However, before we reported the case to Popular Bookstore, we spoke with Anthony Fok to verify the fact. Anthony Fok admitted to us that he made a grave mistake by asking his students to write the books. He also claimed that his former economics teachers had advised him against publishing such books, although he did not heed their advice. Anthony Fok requested us to give him some time for the current copies of the books to be sold out and he promised that he would then revise the contents of all the books.

Popular Bookstore subsequently arranged a meeting to verify the fact with Anthony Fok. Anthony Fok did not dispute the fact, except that he claimed to have written some of the twenty books by himself. Popular Bookstore has since taken down the books.

Anthony Fok has since realized his grave mistake and is also willing to accept the consequences of his mistake. We can sense his remorse. However, as a significant number of the books had been purchased by parents before the titles were taken down by Popular Bookstore, we strongly advise students who have possession of the books to discontinue using them. We have also put up a request to Popular Bookstore to put in place some sort of vetting system to prevent this kind of incident from happening again.

##### **Annex E:** The further revised Facebook post published by Edmund sometime between 16-26 September 2019 on EC’s public facing Facebook page, and which was made into a Sponsored Post on Facebook.

Anthony Fok, who is an economics tutor in Singapore, published about twenty books in a short span of a _few months_. Recently, to our astonishment, it was brought to our attention most of the books \[sic\] were written by his students. As we believed that such books were likely to do students more harm than good, as his students were unlikely to have a thorough understanding of the key economic concepts, we decided to report the case to Popular Bookstore. _This is especially true in view of the fact that Anthony Fok did not have a university degree in economics despite having taught economics as a private tutor for a few years. Anthony Fok has been awarded an external degree in economics from Murdoch University only recently through distance learning by attending classes at Kaplan which is a private school in Singapore, a fact which was made known to us by Anthony Fok himself._

However, before we reported the case to Popular Bookstore, we spoke with Anthony Fok to verify the fact. Anthony Fok admitted to us that he made a grave mistake by asking his students to write the books. He also claimed that his former economics teachers had advised him against publishing such books, although he did not heed their advice. Anthony Fok requested us to give him some time for the current copies of the books to be sold out and he promised that he would then revise the contents of all the books. We told him that it would not be good for students and we would report the case to Popular Bookstore and let them decide the best way to deal with the case. After the phone call with Anthony Fok, we followed up by sending him two messages describing the gist of the conversation, specifically the part where he admitted his mistake. Popular Bookstore subsequently arranged a meeting to verify the fact with Anthony Fok. Anthony Fok did not dispute the fact, except that he claimed to have written some of the twenty books by himself. Popular Bookstore has since taken down the books.

Anthony Fok has since realized his grave mistake and is also willing to accept the consequences of his mistake. We can sense his remorse. However, as a significant number of the books had been purchased by parents before the titles were taken down by Popular Bookstore, we strongly advise students who have possession of the books to discontinue using them. We have also put up a request to Popular Bookstore to put in place some sort of vetting system to prevent this kind of incident from happening again. A check with Popular Bookstore will confirm this account.

Clarification: We would like to clarify that the verification with Anthony Fok was done through his representative, Ken Tan, who was the manager at CDP \[sic\], a publishing company owned by Anthony Fok. A check with Popular Bookstore will confirm this account.
