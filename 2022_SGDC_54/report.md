Contempt of Court – Civil contempt

10 March 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       In a case where a party subject to an order of the Strata Titles Board (“**STB**”) has breached the order, the other party to the order may seek leave from a District Court to enter judgment in terms of the said STB order – for the purpose of enforcing the STB order in the same manner as a judgment of that court. This is so provided by s 120(1) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004 (“**BMSMA**”):

> Any order (including an interim order) made under this Part or the Land Titles (Strata) Act may, by leave of a District Court, be enforced against the person in the same manner as a judgment of that court, and _where leave is so given, judgment may be entered in terms of that order_. \[emphasis added\]

2       One of the modes of enforcing a judgment is to seek leave under O 45 r 5 of the Rules of Court to apply for a committal order.

3       DC/SUM 3842/2021 **(“SUM 3842”)** raises a novel issue as to whether a party who wishes to enforce an STB order by way of committal proceedings must take out _two separate and sequential_ leave applications: (“**the Issue**”)

> (a)     The _first_ being an application under s 120(1) for leave for judgment to be entered in terms of the STB order.

> (b)     The _second_ being an application under O 45 r 5 for leave to commence committal proceedings if the respondent disobeys the judgment that had been entered pursuant to s 120(1).

4       In SUM 3842, the applicant did _not_ take out two separate and sequential applications to enforce an STB order. Instead, the applicant had applied for leave under both s 120(1) and O 45 r 5 in the _same_ application.

5       In my judgment, _the Issue ought to be answered in the affirmative_. In other words, to enforce an STB order by way of committal proceedings, an applicant must first apply under s 120(1) for leave for judgment to be entered in terms of the STB order. This is so that the judgment can be served on the respondent. After this has been done and if the respondent refuses or neglects to comply with the said judgment, then the applicant can make a second application – this time for leave under O 45 r 5 to commence committal proceedings against the respondent.

6       Before explaining the reasons for my decision, it would be useful to briefly state the background facts to SUM 3842.

## The facts

7       The Applicant is a subsidiary proprietor of a development known as North Spring Bizhub. The Respondent is the Management Corporation of the Strata Title Plan (“**MCST**”) of the said development.

8       The Applicant and the Respondent had a matter before the STB. On 7 June 2021, the STB issued a consent order whereby the Respondent was required to provide certain materials to the Applicant (“**the STB Order**”). The terms of the STB Order are as follows:

> **TAKE NOTICE** that pursuant to an application made in the above proceedings by the abovenamed Applicant AND parties having appeared before the Strata Titles Board \[...\] on 7 June 2021; it is now **BY CONSENT** of both the Applicant and Respondent, ordered that, in full and final settlement of this Application:-

>> 1.    The Respondent to supply and make available to the Applicant photocopies of the following documents:-

>>> a.    All wheel-clamp release payment receipts from 2017 to 2020 by **11-June-2021**;

>>> b.    All wheel-clamp release payment refund invoices and/or receipts from 2017 to 2020 by **11-June-2021**;

>>> c.    Redacted monthly bank statements from 2017 to 2020 pertaining to the wheel-clamp release payments and refunds being credited to and/or withdrawn from the MCST’s bank account, and the Respondent is to provide auditor’s confirmation that the relevant bank entries form part and consist of wheel clamp income collected and/or refunded, and such bank statements is to be furnished by **25-June-2021**; and

>>> d.    Monthly council meeting minutes from December 2016 to 2020 by **18-June-2021**.

>> 2.    \[...\]

9       The STB Order had also contained the following notice:

> **Important**: Contravention of this order is an offence under section 120 of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act. The offender may be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for a term up to 5 years.

10     In breach of the STB Order, the Respondent –

> (a)     provided the redacted bank statements only about one month _after_ the deadline set in the order, and

> (b)     failed to provide the auditor’s confirmation altogether.

11     On 6 September 2021, the Applicant filed an _ex parte_ application (DC/OSS 173/2021 **(“OSS 173”)**) for leave to be granted to the Applicant –

> ... for an application for an order of committal against Lee Chang Joon \[...\], the Chairperson of the Management Council of the Respondent.

12     OSS 173 was made under _both_ –

> (a)     s 120(_2_) of the BMSMA, and

> (b)     O 45 r 5 and O 52 r 2.

13     On 22 September 2022, a district judge made the following order (“**the District Judge**”) _vide_ DC/ORC 3285/2021 **(“ORC 3285”)**:

> Leave be granted to the Applicant for an application for an order of committal against LEE CHANG JOON \[...\], the Chairperson of the Management Council of the Respondent.

14     On 29 September 2021, the Applicant applied pursuant to SUM 3842 for a hearing of an application by the Applicant for an order –

> That Lee Chang Joon \[...\], the Chairperson of the Management Council of the Respondent, do stand committed to prison to be there imprisoned for his contempt of Court.

15     SUM 3842 was heard by me. At the hearing, I posed the Issue to the parties.

16     The Respondent answered the Issue in the affirmative.

## The Applicant’s submissions

17     The Applicant took a contrary view on the Issue. The Applicant’s submissions on the Issue may be summarised as follows:

> (a)     Despite the fact that the supporting documents for its application in OSS 173 had referred to s 120(_2_), the application was in fact made pursuant to s 120(_1_) of the BMSMA.[^1]

> (b)     There was no prohibition against the Applicant applying for leave of court under s 120(1) _and_ O 52 together in the _same_ summons in OSS 173.[^2]

> (c)     Even though the STB Order was directed at the Respondent, it was appropriate for the Applicant to commence committal proceedings against Lee Chang Joon (“**Lee**”). This was because at all material times, Lee was an officer of the Respondent, being the chairperson of its Management Council. Furthermore, Lee had represented the Respondent at the STB proceedings, including when the STB Order was granted. According to the Applicant, Lee was “the mastermind behind the decisions taken by the \[Respondent\]” and had “wilfully refused and/or neglected to obey” the STB Order”. If there is any issue regarding Lee’s role in the Respondent’s breach of the STB Order, this ought to be determined at the committal proceedings instead of summarily when determining the Issue.[^3]

> (d)     Under ORC 3285, the District Judge had granted leave to both (i) enforce the STB Order as a judgement and (ii) commence committal proceedings against Lee. The District Judge had applied her mind to the Issue when she issued ORC 3285.[^4]

## Preliminary observations

18     I wish to make a few preliminary observations regarding SUM 3842.

> (a)     First, the Applicant appeared to take the position that as long as the Respondent had breached the STB Order, this fact alone was sufficient basis to commence committal proceedings.

> (b)     Second, the Applicant did not treat the Respondent and Lee as separate entities regarding the breach of the STB Order.

19     I make these observations for the following reasons.

> (a)     In the Statement filed to support OSS 173,[^5] the Applicant alleged that the Respondent had attempted to frustrate the enforcement of the STB Order. The Applicant further asserted that the Respondent’s failure to obey “the _aforesaid Order of Court_ is a _contempt of Court_ calculated to bring into disrespect orders of the Court” \[emphasis added\]. When the Statement is read in context, it is clear that the phrase “the aforesaid Order of Court” is referring to the STB Order.

> (b)     The Applicant submitted that it was an “unnecessary step” to have to wait for a judgment under s 120(1) to be extracted, to wait for that judgment to be served on _Lee_, and to wait for his disobedience of the judgment before commencing committal proceedings against Lee.[^6] This was because _the Respondent_ had already breached, and continued to be in breach of, the STB Order.[^7]

## My decision

### The STB Order is not a “judgment or order” coming within O 45 r 5

20     In my judgment, it is wrong for the Applicant (a) to treat the STB Order as if it was a judgment and (b) to assume that a breach of the STB Order automatically engages O 45 r 5(1) and O 52 r 2.

21     Order 45 r 5(1) provides as follows:

> Where –

>> (a)    a person required by a _judgment or order_ to do an act within a time specified in the _judgment or order_ refuses or neglects to do it within that time or, as the case may be, within that time as extended or abridged under Order 3, Rule 4; or

>> (b)    ...

>> then, subject to these Rules, the _judgment or order_ may be enforced by one or more of the following means:

>>> (i)    ...

>>> (ii)   where that person is a body corporate, with the leave of the Court, an order of committal against a director or other officer of the body;

>>> (iii)   ...

>> \[emphasis added\]

22     It is clear from a plain reading of O 45 r 5(1) that this provision is engaged only when a person disobeys “a judgment or order”. The STB Order is clearly neither a “judgment” nor an “order”.

> (a)     Order 42 deals specifically with the issue of “Judgments and Orders”. Within the scheme of the Rules of Court, it is clear that a “judgment” and an “order” in O 45 r 5(1) and O 42 must refer to one that has been made in “Open Court” or “in Chambers” by a “Judge”, a “Registrar” or a “Court”.

> (b)     The STB is an administrative body. A consent order made by such a body clearly does not fall within the scope of a “judgment or order”.

> (c)     The fact that an STB order is not a “judgment or order” is reinforced by s 120(1). Section 120(1) specifically provides that an STB order “may, _by leave of a District Court_, be enforced against the person in the same manner as a judgment of that court”. If an STB order is a “judgment or order” without more, then s 120(1) would have been superfluous.

### Breach of the STB Order did not constitute “contempt of court” under O 52

23     In my judgment, it is wrong for the Applicant to have treated a breach of the STB Order as a contempt of court under O 52.

> (a)     As stated above, the STB Order is _not_ a “judgment or order”.

> (b)     Order 52 r 1 deals with “\[t\]he power of the Court to punish for _contempt of court_”. \[emphasis added\] According to O 52 r 1A, “contempt of court” is defined to mean contempt of court under the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (Act 19 of 2016) and includes, subject to section 8, contempt of court under the common law. The word “court” has been defined in s 2(a) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 and O 1 r 4(2).

> (c)     The STB is clearly not a “court” as defined in the Act.

### No leave had been granted pursuant to s 120(1)

24     It bears remembering that the Applicant had made _two_ applications under OSS 173 – one under O 45 r 5 and O 51 r 2, and the other under s 120.

25     Pursuant to the Applicant’s application in OSS 173, the District Judge granted leave in ORC 3285 as follows:

> Leave be granted to the Applicant for an application for an order of committal against LEE CHANG JOON \[...\], the Chairperson of the Management Council of the Respondent.

26     On a plain reading of ORC 3285, leave was only granted under O 45 r 5 and O 51 r 2 for the Applicant’s application for committal proceedings. ORC 3285 did not state that leave had also been granted under s 120(1) for judgment to be entered in terms of the STB Order.

### Lee was not subject to any judgment

27     Furthermore, it bears remembering that under the STB Order, it was _the Respondent_ that had been directed to provide the relevant materials. _Lee_ had not been directed to provide such materials in either the STB Order or ORC 3285.

28     The gravamen of contempt of court under O 45 r 5 and O 52 lies in the disobedience of a judgment or order by a person who is bound by it. In the absence of a judgment or order directing Lee to provide the relevant materials, there is simply no basis for the Applicant to apply for committal proceedings against him.

### An application for leave under s 120(1) and under O 45 r 5 are different and should not be conflated

29     The Applicant submitted that there was nothing to prohibit an aggrieved party from applying for both (a) leave to enforce the STB Order under s 120(1) and (b) leave to commence committal proceedings against Lee under O 45 r 5 and O 52 in the same application.

30     I am unable to accept this submission. As shown above, without _first_ obtaining leave of court under s 120(1), the STB Order could not be enforced as a “judgment or order” pursuant to O 45.

31     At risk of stating the obvious, an application for leave to enforce the STB Order under s 120(1) and an application for a committal order under O 45 r 5(1) and O 52 are _two very different applications._ These applications serve _different purposes._ The considerations for granting leave under these provisions are also different. This had been accepted by the Applicant.[^8] These differences can be summarised as follows:

![]([2022] SGDC 0054_Image/[2022] SGDC 0054_image1.png)

### Expediency should never be a consideration where committal proceedings are concerned

32     Although the Applicant acknowledged that an application under s 120(1) and an application under O 45 r 5 and O 52 r 2 are different, it nonetheless submitted that it was “an unnecessary step” to have to wait for a judgment under s 120(1) to be extracted, to wait for that judgment to be served on _Lee_, and to wait for his disobedience of the judgment before commencing committal proceedings against Lee.

33     I am unable to agree with the Applicant.

> (a)     First, to accept the Applicant’s submission would be to _conflate_ an application under s 120(1) with an application under O 45 r 5(1) and O 52. As shown in \[31\] above, there are important differences between these two applications.

> (b)     Second, it is well established that a committal proceeding is a remedy of last resort. The power to punish for contempt, including by committing a person to prison – should only be exercised sparingly. Before commencing committal proceeding, an opportunity ought to be given to a defaulting party to purge the contempt.

### The Issue had not been raised for the District Judge’s consideration

34     In supporting SUM 3842, the Applicant submitted that the District Judge had granted leave to both enforce the STB Order (pursuant to s 120(1)) and to commence committal proceedings against Lee (pursuant to O 52) _vide_ ORC 3285.

35     This submission could be summarily dealt with:

> (a)     First, as shown above, the terms of ORC 3285 did not support the Applicant’s contention that leave had been granted to enforce the STB Order as a judgment.

> (b)     Second, there is nothing to show that the Issue had been drawn to the District Judge’s attention in OSS 173, which was an _ex parte_ application.

> (c)     Finally, the Applicant accepted that the District Judge’s decision in OSS 173 did not preclude me from finding that the Applicant had failed to establish the basis for commencing committal proceedings in SUM 3842.

### How the STB Order can be enforced

36     In my judgment, the proper way to enforce the STB Order is to first seek leave under s 120(1) so that “judgment may be entered in terms of that order”. This step is necessary to “convert” the STB Order (an order made by an administrative body) into a judgment for the purpose of enforcement under the Rules of Court. This reading accords with a plain text of s 120(1).

37     In the present case, I noted that the STB Order had set a deadline of 25 June 2021 for the Respondent to provide the auditor’s confirmation. Given that a judgment takes effect from the date is made, the judgment ought to require that the auditor’s confirmation be provided within a reasonable time _after_ the date of _that judgment_.

38     The judgment under s 120(1) should then be served on Lee. It is only when Lee has failed to obey the judgment that an application for committal proceeding can be made, assuming that the requirements in O 45 r 5 and O 52 r 2 have been complied with.

## Conclusion

39     In conclusion, I found that the Applicant had failed to prove that it had obtained leave to enter judgment in terms of the STB Order pursuant to s 120(1). No judgment had been served on Lee arising from the STB Order for which he could be said to have disobeyed.

40     Accordingly, I dismissed SUM 3842.
