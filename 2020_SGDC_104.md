### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       On the evening of 30 April 2017, which was the eve of a public holiday, **Maureen**, her husband **George**, his brother **Daniel** and Daniel’s wife **Sreelatha**, went to a bar at Tebing Lane to eat dinner and watch a football match.

2       The five defendants were also at the bar that night. Michael Marcus Liew (“**Michael**”), Cheo Lye Choon (“**Lye Choon”**), Tok Meng Chong (“**Meng Chong**”) and Ng Wan Seng (“**Wan Seng**”) were friends from school, and they together with other friends met at the bar for drinks and to catch up. Chan Hui Yi Regina (“**Regina**”), who was then Wan Seng’s girlfriend, joined them.

3       Early the next morning, at closing time, the patrons of the bar began to leave the premises. George, Maureen, Daniel and Sreelatha went to their car, which was parked at an open carpark nearby. George, who was driving, turned on the engine and switched on the headlights of the car.

4       As they were preparing to drive off, the defendant Michael walked by in front of the car. He was intoxicated and supported by two other persons. Michael suddenly kicked the front of the car a few times. Daniel, who was seated in the rear passenger seat behind George, alighted and asked Michael why he had kicked the car. Michael kicked Daniel twice. The situation deteriorated rapidly from then. George, Maureen and Sreelatha alighted from the car. George walked over to talk to Michael and his friends, who were a short distance away. George was assaulted by the defendants Lye Choon, Meng Chong, Wan Seng and Michael. Seeing her husband being assaulted, Maureen tried to go over to help him, but she was intercepted and physically assaulted by the defendant Regina. Sreelatha went forward to help Maureen up, but she too was assaulted by Regina.

5       Each of the five defendants was charged with being a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to the four victims (Maureen, George, Sreelatha, Daniel), an offence under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”). They claimed trial to the charge. At the conclusion of the trial they were each found guilty and convicted. On 31 January 2020, they were sentenced to imprisonment terms ranging from 12 to 18 months. The defendants filed their present appeals against their conviction and sentence the same day.

6       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charges

7       The defendants each faced a common charge of rioting, under s 147 of the Penal Code, which read as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 1 May 2017 at or around 2.16 am, in the vicinity of 10 Tebing Lane, Singapore, together with \[the other four defendants\] were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to voluntarily cause hurt to G K Karunan George and Maureen Baricautro Mamucod, K Amuthan Daniel and Sreelatha Thankamaniamma, and in the prosecution of the common object of such assembly, one or more of you did use violence, _to wit_, by hitting and kicking the aforementioned victims, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

8       Section 147 of the Penal Code provides:

> Whoever is guilty of rioting shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years and shall be liable to caning.

#### Prosecution’s case

9       The key witnesses of the prosecution were the four victims, namely:

> (a)     Maureen Baricautro Mamucod (PW1, “**Maureen**”);

> (b)     G K Karunan George (PW2, “**George**”);

> (c)     Sreelatha Thankamaniamma (PW3, “**Sreelatha**”); and

> (d)     K Amuthan Daniel (PW4, “**Daniel**”).

#### (a)   Events before the riot

10     It was the testimony of the four victims that on the night of 30 April 2017, they were at the Frienzie Bar & Bistro (located at 10, Tebing Lane) for dinner and to watch a football match. Early on the morning of 1 May 2017, they left the bar and walked towards the carpark, to Lot 42 where George had parked his car. They sat in the car, with George at the driver’s seat, Maureen at the front passenger seat, Daniel at the rear passenger seat behind George, and Sreelatha at the rear passenger seat behind Maureen.[^1]

#### (b)   Near Lot 42 - Michael kicks Daniel

11     George started the engine of the car and turned on the headlights. The defendant Michael, who was being supported by two persons, walked past the front of the car, from the left to the right. Michael kicked the headlights of the car a few times, first on the left and then on the right.[^2]

12     Daniel alighted from the car and asked Michael why he had kicked the car. In response, Michael removed his arms from around the shoulders of the two persons supporting him, and he then kicked Daniel twice. Daniel fell to the ground on the second kick. Daniel was then attacked by about three persons as he lay on the ground. George, Maureen and Sreelatha alighted from the car to find out what was happening. Daniel asked Maureen to call the police, and Maureen reached into the car for her handphone to make a ‘999’ call. [^3]

13     Maureen’s call was recorded in the First Information Report, which was tendered in evidence (Exh P2). The text of the message was: “1 guy just kick my brother in law.”

#### (c)   Near Lot 55 – Michael, Wan Seng, Lye Choon, Meng Chong attack George

14     While Maureen was calling the police, George spotted Michael near a van parked at Lot 55, a short distance away. (A sketch plan showing the general layout of the carpark was tendered in evidence as Exh P8.) George walked over to speak with him. As George tried to speak with Michael, he was kicked from behind on his left shoulder, causing him to fall forward on top of Michael. As George lay face down on the ground, the defendants Wan Seng, Lye Choon and Meng Chong surrounded him. Wan Seng hit George on his back with a black baton[^4], while Lye Choon and Meng Chong beat George with their bare hands. Michael got up from the ground and joined in the assault on George. George testified that they were “repeatedly whacking” his back while he was face down on the ground.[^5]

#### (d)   Near Lot 57/58 – Regina assaults Maureen, Sreelatha

15     After Maureen called the police, she saw that George was being surrounded and beaten up. She ran towards him to try to stop the attack. As Maureen was running past carpark Lot 57 or 58, the defendant Regina pulled Maureen back by her hair, causing Maureen to fall to the ground. Regina then hit and kicked Maureen’s head as she lay on the ground. When Daniel noticed that Maureen and George were being attacked, he asked Sreelatha to help Maureen, while he went to the aid of George. When Sreelatha tried to help Maureen to get up, Regina attacked Sreelatha and hit her on her right eye and lip.[^6]

#### (e)   Events after the riot

16     Soon after, two Indian men in plain clothes (who have not been identified) approached the group, saying that they were the police and asking everyone to stop. The defendants stopped attacking the victims. Wan Seng kept the baton back in his van, and got onto the van together with Regina. Maureen stood in front of their van to prevent them from leaving. Uniformed police officers arrived shortly after. Maureen and George were conveyed by an ambulance to the Changi General Hospital (CGH), while Sreelatha and Daniel were escorted to the Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre to assist with investigations.[^7]

#### (f)   Injuries suffered by the victims

17     Maureen testified that she had a big lump on her head because of how Regina pulled her hair and she fell, and she also had some bruises on her hand.[^8] A medical examination of Maureen found that she had a hematoma over the left temporal occipital, as well as a superficial bruise over the dorsum of the right hand. She was noted to be feeling giddy and had vomited on the ambulance and in the A&E Department. She was diagnosed to have suffered a minor head injury (Exh P10). A CT scan was conducted, and she was advised to stay in the hospital for observation due to her symptoms. The injuries sustained by Maureen were consistent with her having been hit on the head.[^9]

18     A medical examination of George found that he had various injuries: a 2 cm erythema patch over the right side of his neck, a 3 mm superficial abrasion over the chin, and tenderness over the left posterior lower ribs region. His diagnosis was that of a contusion of the face and back (Exh P9). He was discharged from hospital with painkillers.

19     Daniel and Sreelatha did not undergo a medical examination, but Daniel testified that he felt pain in his lower abdominals,[^10] and Sreelatha said that she suffered injury to her eye and a cut on her lip.[^11]

#### (g)   Roles of defendants in the riot

20     It was the prosecution’s case that the defendants were all members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to voluntarily cause hurt to the four victims. _Michael_ initiated the violence by the group of defendants by first kicking Daniel near Lot 42; he was subsequently involved in the attack on George near Lot 55. _Wan Seng_ armed himself with a baton and actively participated in assaulting George with the baton. _Regina_ attacked Maureen and Sreelatha; she attacked Maureen who was trying to stop the attack on her husband by the other defendants, and after that she also attacked Sreelatha who was trying to lift Maureen up. _Lye Choon_ and _Meng Chong_ were involved in the attack on George near Lot 55, by beating him with their bare hands.

#### Defence

21     The defendants were called upon to enter their defence, and they elected to testify.

22     The crux of the defence was that the defendants were at the bar until about 2 am, when they left. Michael made his way to the carpark first. Michael was going towards his car when he was confronted by the victims at the carpark and assaulted by them. When Wan Seng and Regina reached the carpark, they saw Michael having an altercation and being assaulted by the victims. They went to assist, and soon got dragged into the fray. Meng Choon and Lye Choon (together with another friend known as Benny) arrived shortly after, and they tried to separate the parties. There was no intention to fight or to riot.

23     Michael testified that he had drunk a copious amount of alcohol – “at least 3 bottles of whiskey and a few towers of beer”. He could not recall much of what happened at the carpark. He walked back to his car, which was parked at Lot 43 (beside Lot 42 where the victims’ car was parked). When asked whether he kicked the victims’ car, he said that he could not recall. He also could not recall the scuffle that ensued when the victims came out of the car and (allegedly) started attacking him.[^12]

24     Wan Seng testified that when he arrived at the carpark, he saw an “Indian on top of \[Michael\]” and an Indian group comprising around four persons “seem to be hitting him” and they “seem to be starting a fight”. Worried for the safety of his friend, and because there were “so many of them there”, Wan Seng took his baton and “went over there for self-defence”. However, he did not reach the group as his girlfriend Regina pulled him and prevented him from going, and snatched the baton away from him. [^13]

25     Regina testified that there was “quarrelling”, “pushing” and the situation was “very chaotic”. Wan Seng wanted to stop his friend from being hit and pushed by an “Indian guy”. She saw Wan Seng holding on to a baton. She was afraid that something would happen to him, so she pulled his hand and snatched the baton that he was holding and put it back into his van. Regina also testified that a Filipino lady (Maureen) pulled her hair and hit her. She had no idea why this lady assaulted her, and she defended herself as she was getting “hit for no reason”, and she pushed the Filipino lady. (She was only defending herself when she was assaulted. She did not attack Maureen or Sreelatha.)[^14]

26     Meng Chong testified that Lye Choon was very drunk. So he and another friend, Benny, had to support Lye Choon. They first brought Lye Choon to the toilet. After that they proceeded to the carpark. As they reached the carpark, they saw Michael and Wan Seng and “two Indian and one female Indian” pushing against each other. They moved towards the group. Meng Chong called out to everyone to “relax”. However, the two male Indians were very angry and agitated and they punched Wan Seng “and his girlfriend”. Lye Choon wanted to go towards the commotion, but Meng Chong stopped Lye Choon and pulled him away.[^15]

27     Lye Choon testified that he was very drunk and he did not know what was going on. All he remembered of that morning was that Meng Chong and Benny were taking care of him, he saw a police car, and he walked to a police station.[^16] A medical report of Lye Choon was tendered in evidence by the defence (Exh D8), showing that his blood sample was obtained at 12.35 pm on the afternoon after the incident. Upon subsequent analysis by the Health Sciences Authority, the blood sample was found to contain ethanol at 123 mg / 100 ml of blood (Exh D9).

#### Issue before the court

28     The issue before the court was largely a factual one, whether the collective testimony given by the four victims was credible and proved the prosecution’s case of the occurrence of the riot beyond a reasonable doubt, or whether their testimony was undermined by the testimonies of the defence witnesses which raised a reasonable doubt.

#### Decision

#### (a)   Evidence of four victims was credible

29     Having considered the testimony of the four victims, I found them to be truthful witnesses, and their testimony was credible and corroborated by objective evidence.

30     Their collective testimony, the key points of which are set out at \[10\] – \[16\] above, was consistent. They described what they witnessed with varying degrees of detail and from different perspectives, but their testimony was materially consistent. Given the large number of persons present in the carpark that morning, it would not have been possible for each victim to have witnessed _everything_ that took place. Their evidence therefore had to be taken as a whole. The evidence that the four victims presented as a whole was clear and credible. While some minor discrepancies could be found between their testimonies, these could be attributed to memory lapses due to the passage of time – which did not undermine the truthfulness and credibility of their testimony.

31     The main discrepancy in their testimony was whether, at the start of the incident, Michael walked past their car while being supported by two other persons (as described by Maureen, Sreelatha, and Daniel)[^17] or Michael walked along in front of a few other persons (according to George)[^18]. This, in my view, was not a major discrepancy. All the four victims were able to identify that it was Michael who walked past and kicked their car. It was also their common testimony that Michael was not alone, but he had other persons with him. The fact that the testimony of George differed from the testimony of the other three victims could simply be due to his failing to observe whether Michael was being supported by other persons. This did not detract from the credibility of their overall testimony that Michael kicked their car, and subsequently kicked Daniel.

32     The victims were able to identify each defendant without difficulty. Some of the defendants had distinctive physical traits, such as a tattoo on the right side of Wan Seng’s neck, and a tattoo on the left side of Lye Choon’s neck. That the defendants had been correctly identified was not challenged by the defence.[^19]

33     The injuries found on the victims also corroborated their accounts of how they had been assaulted by the defendants. The head injury that Maureen was diagnosed to have suffered (above, at \[17\]) corroborated her testimony that Regina pulled her by her hair, and kicked and hit her head while she was on the ground. The superficial bruise on her right hand was consistent with her evidence that she fell to the ground during the assault by Regina. The injuries found on George (above, at \[18\]) were also consistent with and corroborated his description of the manner in which he was attacked.

#### (b)   Michael’s defence was not credible

34     The gist of Michael’s defence was one of a bare denial. He denied any knowledge of the material events that transpired, saying that he was unable to remember anything as he was intoxicated from his heavy consumption of alcohol (above, at \[23\]).

35     Michael’s intoxication was, however, not a credible defence or a valid defence at law. Michael was clearly and consistently identified by all the victims as the man who kicked their car. The victims were also consistent in their testimony that Michael kicked Daniel twice, causing him to fall down on the second kick. All the victims saw Michael raising his leg to kick Daniel. (Maureen described it as a kick “on the waist, going to the thigh”; George, “above the hips”; Sreelatha, “the right side” of Daniel’s body; Daniel, the “lower abdomen”.)[^20] Michael was also identified to have been subsequently involved in the attack on George near Lot 55 (above, at \[14\]).

36     Furthermore, given that Michael’s intoxication was self-induced due to his excessive consumption of alcohol at the bar, it did not amount to a valid defence at law. The defence did not make any convincing argument on the law and the facts that the defence of intoxication was applicable (as set out at ss 85-86 of the Penal Code.)

#### (c)   Wan Seng’s defence was not credible

37     The gist of Wan Seng’s defence was that he went to the aid of his friend Michael. He took the baton from his van in self-defence, and he did not hit anyone with the baton (above, at \[24\]).

38     I found Wan Seng’s defence to be not credible. There were material inconsistencies between his oral testimony in court and the statement that he gave to the police on the afternoon after the incident. In court, Wan Seng said that he saw Michael surrounded by _four to five persons_ who “seem to be hitting him”.[^21] However, in the police statement, he stated that he saw Michael (whom he referred to as “my friend”) quarrelling and fighting with _one_ Indian man: [^22]

> When I reach the open carpark after leaving the Beer Garden, I see got people quarrelling. One of them is my friend. He is _quarrelling with one Indian man_. Because I see my friend is one person quarrelling with the Indian man, I go to my company’s van and take my black baton from underneath my driver’s seat and I _go and approach the Indian man_. But when I was walking halfway to approach _the Indian man_, my girlfriend and one more of my friend, snatch away the baton from my hand. After that I think I got more clear mind so I didn’t go and fight. I go to _the Indian man_ and my friend to stop them from fighting. I push my friend if my friend want to go near the Indian man and I push the Indian man if he want to go to my friend. _I try to stop my friend and the Indian man from fighting. They fight near some cars._ I don’t know whose car they fight near to. \[...\] At one time, the Indian man was lying on top of my friend who is below him. _I pull the Indian man_ by upper part of his shoulder and then the fight stop.

\[Emphasis _in italics_ added\]

39     Wan Seng’s initial testimony during examination-in-chief was that he saw Michael with a group of four or five people, and there was “some pushing and argument”.[^23] In his police statement, Wan Seng described Michael and an Indian man as “fighting”[^24]. When shown the statement during cross-examination, he modified his testimony and said that he saw them “punching” each other.[^25]

40     In trying to explain the discrepancy in his statement, Wan Seng claimed that he told the statement recorder that there were four to five people around Michael, but the statement recorder chose not to record this down.[^26] The statement recorder, Station Inspector Mohamed Rashid (PW10, “**SI Rashid**”) was called by the prosecution as a rebuttal witness. SI Rashid testified that he typed out whatever Wan Seng said, and read the statement back to him. SI Rashid confirmed that Wan Seng was given an opportunity to make amendments, and he did write amendments down on the typewritten statement, such as on p 3 of the statement.[^27] I found SI Rashid to be a truthful witness and that he had recorded what Wan Seng told him in the statement. There was no reason for SI Rashid to have done otherwise. Wan Seng’s assertion that the statement recorder did not record down what he had said was not credible.

41     I also found Wan Seng’s claim, that he did not use the baton to hit anyone, to be untrue. The victims were all able to identify Wan Seng from the distinct tattoo on the right side of his neck. George noticed Wan Seng taking the baton from a van, and Wan Seng was tapping the baton on his palm. Sreelatha saw Wan Seng holding the baton. Maureen and Daniel saw Wan Seng using the baton to beat George on the back.[^28]

#### (d)   Regina’s defence was not credible

42     The gist of Regina’s defence was that she had acted in “self-defence” because she was attacked by Maureen, and she pushed Maureen away; she did not hit Maureen or Sreelatha (above, at \[25\]).

43     I found Regina’s defence to be not credible at all. Regina was unable to give a consistent answer as to how she responded to Maureen’s alleged attack. During examination-in-chief, she said that she only “pushed” Maureen; under cross-examination, she said that she used her arm to “block” Maureen, she “was swinging” her arm to block and was not sure whether she hit Maureen or not.[^29]

44     There was no evidence to corroborate Regina’s claim that Maureen attacked her. There was no objective evidence of the injuries suffered by Regina as a result of this alleged assault by Maureen. The sole injury that Regina said she suffered was an abrasion on her right knee, and she was unsure how she had sustained it.[^30] When Regina underwent a medical examination on the afternoon after the incident, she had no complaints and no fresh injuries were noted on her. (The medical report on Regina was tendered in evidence as Exh P16.)

45     Regina’s testimony in court that she had snatched the baton from Wan Seng before he could use it on anyone was also not credible. That testimony was materially inconsistent with what she had told the police in her statement recorded in the evening after the incident. In the police statement, when she was asked whether Wan Seng was holding the baton and it had been snatched from his hand, she said that she had “no recollection”:

> Q14)  There is an information received that your boyfriend had carried the baton and was approaching the Indian group but you and one more of his friends came and snatch the baton away from his hand. What do you have to say about this?

> A14)  I had no recollection about that. I can only recall bit by bit of what happened.[^31]

46     I found Regina to be not a truthful witness at all, and rejected her claim that she had been attacked by Maureen and had acted merely in self-defence.

#### (e)   Lye Choon’s defence was not credible

47     The gist of Lye Choon’s defence was that of a bare denial. He was so drunk that he did not know what was going on (above, at \[27\]).

48     Lye Choon’s intoxication was, however, not a credible defence or a valid defence at law. The evidence disclosed that Lye Choon was not so intoxicated that he played no part at all in the incident.

49     In the statement that the co-defendant Meng Chong gave to the police in the evening after the incident, he said that although Lye Choon was very drunk, Lye Choon was “walking towards the commotion”:

> \[...\] Chun was very drunk by then, but _he was walking towards the commotion_. He was stumbling left and right. I just saw that Chun was very drunk then, and Chun has a very bad temper when he is drunk. Benny did not drink then but I did. However, I can control myself. Benny and I _accompanied Chun over to the commotion_ with the intention to prevent matters from getting worse and to separate \[Wan Seng\] and Michael from the Indian group.[^32]

(Emphasis added)

50     In Regina’s police statement, she stated that Lye Choon rushed forward towards the commotion:

> Suddenly, my boyfriend’s friend _the person who was drunk \[referring to Lye Choon\] rush forward towards the two groups_. I didn’t see what his friend did because I straightaway turned to my boyfriend and pulled my boyfriend away because I saw that he wanted to go forward towards the two groups. \[...\][^33]

(Emphasis added)

51     Notwithstanding Lye Choon being drunk, there was evidence that he did participate in the commotion. Maureen positively identified Lye Choon as one of the persons who attacked George near Lot 55 (above, at \[14\]). Lye Choon could be easily identified from the distinctive tattoo on the left side of his neck.[^34]

52     As with Michael (above, at \[36\]), Lye Choon’s self-induced intoxication was not a valid defence at law.

#### (f)   Meng Chong’s defence was not credible

53     The gist of Meng Chong’s defence was that he and Benny were taking care of Lye Choon, who was very drunk, and hence he was not involved in the commotion (above, at \[26\]).

54     I found Meng Chong’s testimony to be not entirely truthful. In his testimony in court Meng Chong gave the impression that he (and Benny) were with Lye Choon at all times and they stopped Lye Choon from going towards the commotion. In his police statement, however, Meng Chong said that Lye Choon was “_walking towards_ the commotion” and he and Benny “_accompanied_ \[Lye Choon\] over to the commotion” (see above, at \[49\]).

55     While Meng Chong sought to downplay his presence at the scene and his involvement in the commotion, he was, however, positively identified by Maureen as one of the three persons who attacked George near Lot 55. Meng Chong was identified based on the absence of any neck tattoos, and his height. Maureen described him as the “taller guy”.[^35] Meng Chong was clearly present when George walked towards the group to talk to them. Meng Chong himself confirmed that George spoke to him that day. [^36]

56     I accepted the clear testimony of Maureen that Meng Chong was at the scene and he was also involved in the attack on George near Lot 55.

#### (g)   Evidence of defence witness Benny was not credible

57     The defendants called one of their friends, Benny Chua (DW6), to testify in their defence. Benny’s testimony was that there was a confrontation between Wan Seng, Regina, two male Indians and a Filipina. He said that “the Filipino and Regina had a heated argument” and the “Filipino laid hands first”. Regina retaliated, and there was a scuffle. Benny also testified that “an Indian rushed forward … and attacked \[Wan Seng\]”, and after that Michael came into the picture and gave a “kick”. While this scuffle was going on, Benny and Meng Chong were looking after Lye Choon. [^37]

58     Benny’s testimony to the effect that it was the victims who started the fight was, however, materially inconsistent with his statement to the police. In his police statement, Benny stated (twice) that he did not know who started the fight:

>   
| 

3.

 | 

\[…\] When me and \[Meng Chong\] brought \[Lye Choon\] out of the toilet, we heard shouting and then we saw our friends \[Wan Seng\], his girlfriend and Michael were involved in quarrel with some Indian guys and Filipino girl. I did not know what the argument was about as they were shouting at each other and then suddenly they started fighting with each other. _I did not know who \[started\] the fight_ first but they were pushing each other. \[...\]

 |
| 

5.

 | 

\[...\]

 |
| 

Q4)

 | 

_Did you see how the fight started?_

 |
| 

Ans)

 | 

_No, I do not_ because when I came out of the toilet, I already saw them arguing but I did not know what the argument was about. So I just quickly went in to separate my friends from the fight further.[^38]

 |
| 

 | 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

59     Benny’s testimony to the effect that he, Lye Choon and Meng Chong stood apart from the group involved in the scuffle, and did not go towards the group at any point during the scuffle,[^39] was also inconsistent with his police statement. In his statement, Benny stated (no less than four times) that he went in to _separate_ the group involved in the scuffle:

>   
| 

3.

 | 

\[...\] Ah Chun was drunk so I left him by the side and then _me and Ah Chong went in to try and separate our friends_ \[Wan Seng\], his girlfriend and also Michael.

 |
| 

\[...\]

 |
| 

5.

 | 

I wish to say that during the incident, I was there but I did not take part in the fight. _I was trying to separate my friends from fighting with the other group_. \[...\]

 |
| 

Q4)

 | 

\[...\]

 |
| 

Ans)

 | 

\[...\] So I just quickly _went in to separate my friends from the fight_ further.

 |
| 

\[...\]

Q13)

Do you have anything else to say or add to your statement?

I wish to say that I was not involved in the fight and that I had no intention to fight with anyone also. _I only went in when they were fighting to separate them_ so that my friends will not get hurt. \[...\][^40]

60     Given these glaring inconsistencies, I found Benny to be not a credible witness at all. He was not an independent witness and his evidence was plainly biased in favour of his friends. I placed no weight on his evidence at all.

#### (h)   Verdict

61     Having considered the totality of the evidence at the trial, I found the evidence of the four victims (Maureen, George, Sreelatha and Daniel) to be credible. Their evidence was consistent and coherent, and corroborated by contemporaneous records such as the first information report (Exh P2) and the medical record of injuries suffered by Maureen (Exh P10) and George (Exh P9).

62     The evidence of the defendants, on the other hand, was contradictory and not credible. For example, the evidence of Wan Seng and Regina that they saw Michael being attacked by a group of Indians was contradicted by the evidence of Benny, who said that it was Regina and Wan Seng who first had a confrontation with them before Michael joined in subsequently. The evidence of Meng Chong that Wan Seng and Regina were punched by two male Indians was contradicted by the evidence of Wan Seng and Regina, who testified that Wan Seng was prevented by Regina from getting involved; and Regina never testified that she was punched by any of the Indian men. In any event, the key thrust of the defence, that it was Michael who was confronted by the victims and that the victims were the aggressors, was unsupported on the evidence and simply incredible.

63     I found that, in the encounter between the five defendants and the four victims early that morning on 1 May 2017, the defendants were clearly the aggressors. The incident started with Michael kicking the victims’ car. Michael was intoxicated. When Daniel alighted from the car to ask Michael why he had kicked the car, Michael kicked Daniel, and this was the start of the riot. When George walked over to the defendants to talk things over near parking Lot 55, he was assaulted by Wan Seng (who had armed himself with a baton), Lye Choon, Meng Chong and Michael. Regina joined in the group’s violence when she attacked Maureen, who was rushing forward to try to stop the attack on George, her husband. When Sreelatha went forward to help Maureen, she was also assaulted by Regina. On the evidence, all five defendants participated in the unlawful assembly by hitting or kicking one or more of the victims.

64     I found that the prosecution had proven the charges against the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt, and the five defendants were found guilty and convicted as charged.

## PLEA OF GUILT

#### Michael: disorderly behaviour

65     After being found guilty on the rioting charge, Michael pleaded guilty to a charge of behaving in a disorderly manner, an offence under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“**MOA**”). The charge was in connection with the same incident as the rioting charge, and read as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 1 May 2017 at or about 2.20 am, in the vicinity of 10 Tebing Lane, Singapore, a public place did behave in a disorderly manner, _to wit_, by shouting loudly despite repeated warnings by the police officers to calm down, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed).

66     Section 20 of the MOA provides:

> Any person who is found guilty of any riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour in any public road or in any public place or place of public amusement or resort, or in the immediate vicinity of, or in, any court, public office, police station or place of worship, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

67     In respect of this charge, the salient facts (to which Michael admitted without qualification) were as follows. On 1 May 2017, at about 2.16 am, the police received a ‘999’ call from Maureen informing that one guy just kicked her brother in law. Station Inspector Freddy Tan Buan Sheng (“**SI Freddy**”) and other police officers were dispatched to the incident location pursuant to the ‘999’ call. Upon arrival at the carpark, SI Freddy directed his officers to separate Maureen and her family from Michael and his friends present at the scene. At about 2.20 am, in defiance of instructions from the police officers to stay with his friends at one side of the carpark, Michael walked over to Maureen’s group and shouted vulgarities at them. The police officers gave Michael several warnings to calm down and move away from Maureen’s group, but he ignored them. When SI Freddy warned Michael to follow the police officers’ instructions, Michael walked up close to SI Freddy’s face and shouted at SI Freddy, challenging his authority as a police officer. SI Freddy asked Michael to step back. Michael refused and continued arguing with SI Freddy in a raised voice. SI Freddy thus ordered that Michael be placed under arrest and escorted to the Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre.

#### Wan Seng: possession of the baton, an offensive instrument

68     After being found guilty on the rioting charge, Wan Seng pleaded guilty to a charge of being armed with an offensive instrument (the black baton), an offence under s 22(1)(a) of the MOA. The charge read as follows:

> You \[...\] are charged that you, on 1 May 2017 at or about 2.16am, in the vicinity of 10 Tebing Lane, Singapore, were armed with an offensive instrument, _to wit_, a black baton, without lawful authority or a lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed).

69     Section 22(1)(a) of the MOA provides:

> 22.—(1)    Any person who is found —

>> (a)    armed with any dangerous or offensive instrument without lawful authority or a lawful purpose;

>> \[...\]

> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years; and any instrument or article found in the possession of that person shall be forfeited.

70     In respect of this charge, the salient facts (to which Wan Seng admitted without qualification) were as follows. Wan Seng was a delivery driver and driving a blue van bearing registration number GBE 9765 S. On SI Freddy’s direction, police officers searched the van, which was parked at Lot 55 of the carpark. The police officers recovered the black baton from a paper box placed in the van. The baton measured about 60 cm in length and was an offensive instrument. Wan Seng admitted to the ownership of the baton and said that he purchased it for over $40 a few days before the offence from a shop at a market in Beach Road.

75     Meng Chong had no prior criminal convictions.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

76     The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 15 months’ imprisonment for each defendant on the rioting charge.

77     In _Phua Song Hua v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 33</span> (“**_Phua Song Hua_**”), Yong CJ made the observation (at \[42\]) that for non-secret society related offences (under s 147 of the Penal Code), the courts have consistently imposed 18 to 36 months’ imprisonment, as well as caning ranging from three to 12 strokes. This observation was made prior to the 2008 amendments to the Penal Code that extended the sentencing range for offences under s 147 of the Penal Code.

78     The prosecution submitted that the present case was at the _lower_ end of this sentencing range. The main aggravating factors included the fact that the violence occurred in a public place and was fuelled by alcohol. The incident took place on a public holiday, and there were other members of the public present. The victims were not the aggressive parties in this dispute. It was a wholly one-sided attack. During the attack, three of the victims (Daniel, George, Maureen) were knocked onto the ground and lay defenceless. The injuries suffered by the victims largely consisted of bruising and tenderness. Having reference to the sentencing precedents (summarised below, at \[82\]), a sentence of at least 15 months’ imprisonment appropriately captured the degree of violence inflicted in the present case.

79     It was further submitted that the same sentence of at least 15 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for each of the five defendants. All of them participated actively in the riot, and their culpability may be regarded as similar. The individual offender is not being sentenced for his individual acts considered in isolation, but for his participation in the collective offence of rioting.

80     It was further submitted that Wan Seng was arguably more culpable as he used a weapon to commit violence. The sentences for the rioting charge and the s 22(1)(a) MOA charge should run consecutively to reflect his greater culpability for using the baton during the riot. For the offence of being in possession of the offensive weapon, the prosecution submitted that from the sentencing precedents (below, at \[84\]), a sentence of 3-6 months’ imprisonment have been imposed. The baton used by Wan Seng was a rather long object of about 60 cm, and had the potential to cause serious injuries. Wan Seng had carried the baton around in his van, and did use the baton in committing the rioting offence. It was submitted that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment be imposed for this offence.

81     For Michael, it was likewise submitted that the sentence for the charge of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the MOA ought to run consecutively with the sentence for the rioting charge. For this charge, the prosecution sought a two-week imprisonment term. It was highlighted that Michael had challenged the authority of a police officer. Public servants, especially police officers, should be protected by the law as they are often exposed to violence and aggression in their front-line duties. A deterrent sentence should be imposed.

#### (a)   Sentencing precedents: s 147, Penal Code

83     The prosecution submitted that the present case could be distinguished from the cases at the lowest end of the range (_Kenneth Tien_ and _Cung San Eng_). In _Kenneth Tien_, the dispute started when the victims, who were drunk and rowdy, punched some of the persons in the club. The offenders took revenge after that by attacking the victims after they had left the club. For _Cung San Eng_, the riot was triggered when one of the victims hit one of the offenders on the back of the head. The prosecution also submitted that the injuries in the present case were comparable to those sustained by the victims in _Robin Anak Mawang_ and _Phua Song Hua_.

#### Mitigation plea

85     In the defendants’ mitigation plea, counsel provided a brief background of each defendant’s personal circumstances. Michael was a businessman with business ventures in China, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. He was divorced, with two children from his previous marriage. Wan Seng and Regina were in a relationship, but have since broken up. Wan Seng was employed as a delivery hand. Regina was employed as a factory hand and lived with her mother. Meng Chong was married with two children. Lye Choon was employed as a factory hand and lived with his family.

86     Michael, Wan Seng, Meng Chong and Lye Choon had been friends since young and lived in the same neighbourhood, prior to Michael moving to set up his own business and regional office in Kuala Lumpur. They and other old friends arranged to meet up, as they had not met for a long time. They met at the bar in Tebing Lane.

87     In mitigation, it was highlighted that the defendants were not members of any secret society. Their purpose of going to the location was to meet for a gathering. There was no planning or premeditation to commit the offence. The injuries sustained by the victims were negligible.

88     Counsel suggested that the sentence ought to be not more than 6 months’ imprisonment. It was also submitted that for the offences to which Michael and Wan Seng pleaded guilty, the sentences ought to run concurrently with the sentence for the rioting charge. They were all committed at the same time and place, and the one transection rule applied.

#### Sentencing considerations

89     In deciding upon the sentence for each defendant, I considered deterrence to be the primary sentencing objective. Retribution was also a relevant sentencing objective for an offence of rioting given the physical harm caused to the victims.

90     I accepted the prosecution’s sentencing submissions, which I found to be principled and supported by precedent. I also accepted the sentencing ranges submitted by the prosecution to be fair and reasonable.

91     That said, it was my judgment that the individual sentences for each defendant ought to be calibrated according to their individual culpability, determined primarily by their roles in the rioting offence, and with due weight being given to whether they were first offenders or had prior criminal convictions.

92     For the rioting charge, it was fortuitous that no serious or lasting harm was caused to the victims. I agreed that a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate. As the prosecution submitted, this was at the _lower_ end of the sentencing range generally imposed by the courts for offences of rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code.

93     In the case of Michael, for his offence of disorderly behaviour, I agreed with the submission of the prosecution that a deterrent sentence was called for. Given his open defiance of the authority of a police officer, the custodial threshold had been crossed, and a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for that offence would be appropriate. I also agreed with the prosecution’s submission that the sentence ought to run _consecutively_ with the sentence for the rioting offence. This was to reflect Michael’s higher culpability, considering that it was his actions that triggered the chain of events that led to the rioting offence being committed by the other defendants.

94     For Wan Seng, having considered the sentencing precedents (above, at \[84\], I accepted the submission of the prosecution that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the offence of possession of the baton, an offensive instrument. The sentence for this offence ought to run consecutively with the sentence for the rioting charge to reflect the higher culpability of Wan Seng in the incident, that he used the baton in committing the rioting offence. This was also to take into account that Wan Seng was not a first offender, and he had prior convictions for a number of offences, including for rioting.

95     For Regina and Lye Choon, a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment for their rioting offence would be appropriate. Their culpability in the offence was similar. While both of them had prior criminal convictions, these were not for similar offences, and no uplift to their sentence was required on account of the antecedents.

96     For Meng Chong, I noted that this was his first offence and he had no prior convictions for any offence. I considered his culpability to be lower than the others and it would be appropriate to make that distinction by imposing on him a lower sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment.

#### Sentences imposed

97     Accordingly, the following sentences were imposed on the defendants:
