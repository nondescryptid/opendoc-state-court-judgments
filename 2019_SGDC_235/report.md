\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9227/2019/01.\]

7 November 2019

### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

1       This is an appeal by the Prosecution against the order of acquittal.

2       At the end of the trial, I was of the view that it was unsafe to convict the Accused on the charge of causing grievous hurt to the victim as the Defence has raised a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. The evidence adduced by the Prosecution’s witnesses were inconsistent and unreliable. The victim Ng Ming Hua (PW6) himself was not even able to identify the Accused as the one responsible for his injuries.

3       On the day in question, the Accused, Bobby Oh Seng Kee, Maynard Loo Hui Xin and Colin Yu Ken Ming went to the nightclub (Lido Palace). The incident that was the subject matter of the charge took place in the early morning of 21 October 2017. The victim and the nightclub “mummy” Michelle Yuan Shu Feng (PW5) were also present at the premises.

4       It was beyond doubt that more than two individuals were involved in the altercation that resulted in the grievous hurt caused to the victim who was a waiter at the nightclub. The Accused claimed that he did not come into physical contact with the victim. The charge as framed did not allege that the incident occurred in pursuant to a common intention. The charge reads as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.42%"> <col width="73.58%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge no</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Details</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-913286-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">that you, on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of October 2017, at or about 1.00 am, in Deluxe Lido Palace, Holiday Inn Atrium, 317 Outram Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to Ng Ming Hua, to wit, by kicking and punching him, thereby causing him to sustain a left angle mandibular fracture, among other injuries, and you have committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

5       It was not in dispute that the Accused and three of his friends or acquaintances (namely, Bobby Oh Seng Kee (PW1), Maynard Loo Hui Xin (PW4) and Colin Yu Ken Ming (PW3)) were patrons of Lido Palace. PW1, PW4 and the Accused had been there on a number of occasions. They were in a private room of Lido Palace at the material time when the incident took place. Out of these four persons, PW1 has pleaded guilty and convicted for slapping the victim, an offence under s323 Penal Code. He was sentenced to pay a fine.

6       The Prosecution called seven witnesses. Only PW3, PW4 and Ho Swee On (PW7) allegedly saw the Accused kicking and or punching the victim. However, none of them can positively say that the Accused punched or kicked at the victim’s face.

7       It is trite that the Prosecution has the legal burden to prove its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not for the Accused to prove his innocence. It is incorrect to suggest that the Accused has to establish “any defence on a balance if probabilities” as appears at the subheading III at page 11 of the Prosecution’s written submission. In my view, this case centred mainly on what took place on the day in question and involved the credibility of witnesses.

8       I found that the evidence of the various witnesses was not consistent with each other. Their evidence was also not consistent with the contemporaneous text messages. These text messages were exhibited collectively as exhibit D1. The Prosecution did not challenge its admissibility or authenticity. Exhibit D1 is divided into 4 tabs to indicate the various chat groups. In D1, tab 1, the chat group members were the Accused, PW1, PW4, Marc Cheng Chee Kien (DW2), one MJ Law and one MJ Chris. Tab2, D1 was a private chat between PW1 and the Accused. D1, tab 3 was a chat group with only the Accused and PW4. D1, tab 4 was a chat group with only the Accused and DW2.

## The Victim’s Evidence

9       I found the victim Ng Ming Hua (PW6) to be a credible witness. I have no difficulty in accepting his evidence. The victim testified that because of the incident on 21 October 2017 at Lido Palace, he suffered fractures to his finger and jaw. According to Dr Jolie Hwee (PW2), the fracture to the jaw was caused by a strong force not a slap. It was caused possibly by a punch or kick.

10     PW6 was quite certain that it was Bobby (PW1) who had slapped him after the victim took away the glass of Martel VSOP liquor that was offered by PW1 to Michelle Yuan Shu Feng (PW5), a “mummy” that worked at the nightclub. The slap was followed by a punch on his left face. He was quite certain PW1 was the one who had punched him. See Day 2 Transcript at page 33. It caused him to fall onto the ground. While on the ground, in supine position, PW6 was kicked. He covered his face with both his hands to block the many kicks at his face. He felt that there were many who kicked him but he cannot see who did it. When asked whether it was Maynard or the Accused who had kicked him, the victim replied that he had “no impression”. During cross-examination, he claimed he was not sure whether PW1 did or did not punch his face. Nevertheless, in his mind PW1 did so. At the same time, PW6 also had no impression of the Accused’s involvement in the kicking or assault. Neither did he have any impression of Maynard (PW4) kicking him while he was on the floor. He also did not know that PW4 had offered him $50,000. But he did ask for $200,000 for compensation.

11     The victim had made almost full recovery from his injuries. He still has residual condition on his eye, which needed to be continuously reviewed by the hospital. He incurred about $4,000 medical bill which he has paid. He was given medical leave by the hospital for 2 months. Thereafter he returned to work.

## PW1’s evidence on Compensation

12     PW1 admitted that he slapped the victim on the day in question. PW1 denied that he offered $200,000 to the victim as compensation. He claimed that he did not know Maynard wanted to offer $50,000 to the victim. On the other hand, PW5 confirmed that the victim did ask $200,000 for compensation. PW5 was the one who had visited the victim in hospital. There were various references in the text messages (exhibit D1) regarding compensation to the victim. In any event, PW1 did admit that he paid $500 for the victim’s hospital bill. He claimed that the payment made was pursuant to PW5’s request and the payment was made through her. See Day 1 Transcript at pages 42 and 44. According to Michelle (PW5), the amount she paid for the victim’s bill was $1400 and PW1 reimbursed her the amount. It was clear that in so far as compensation or payment of medical bill, PW5 dealt only with PW1. Why was this so? In addition, why did PW1 compensate the victim for either $500 or $1400? Was it because PW1 was the one who caused the grievous hurt or hurt to the victim? There was no credible explanation offered by PW1. It could be that PW1 was responsible for all the injuries caused to the victim. In this context, the reliability of PW 1 was questionable.

## PW1’s denial of Punching

13     When confronted with exhibit D1, tab1, at page 134, time stamp 21/10/2017 at 1:50:55pm “boby-1 inch punch performance”, PW1 denied the punch. However, this was inconsistent with the Prosecution witness PW6’s evidence (the victim) that PW1 slapped and punched him. As to the remarks by the Accused about the Southern fist and Northern kick in the group chat, PW1 claimed that Southern fist and Northern leg were casual remarks and attributed it as nonsensical texts by the Accused. I was of the view that this claim by PW1 was not credible considering the fact that he knew by then at 1:52:07 pm that the victim had been hospitalized and he had expressed the hope that the victim did not lodge a police report. The remark about the Northern kick could not be nonsensical as it was consistent with PW4’s own admission at D1, tab 3, page 8 annotated as 16(d) that he did “stamp” on the victim. Moreover, at time stamp, 8:43:41pm, PW1 proposed to call the room at the nightclub as Southern fist and Northern leg, albeit in a light-hearted mood. In the circumstances, I was of the view that PW1’s claim was an afterthought. PW1’s allegation was clearly inconsistent with PW4’s admission.

14     During cross-examination, PW1 alleged that the Accused could have planned all the text exchanges, as he knew that the injuries sustained by the victim were serious. I rejected this allegation. I was of the view it was a self-serving bare allegation by PW1 as the Accused had texted about the punch and kick at 1:50:55pm on 21 October 2017 before PW1 received the news that the Victim was hospitalised at 1:52:07pm on the same day and expressed his hope that the victim will not lodge a police report. Hence, the Accused could not have known about the seriousness of the injuries suffered by the victim when he texted that message.

15     In exhibit D1, there was no reference at all that the Accused did assault the victim by either kicking, punching or slapping. This was also consistent with PW1’s testimony at Day 1 Transcript at page 9, lines 21-24 where he said during his EIC that he was not able to see if the Accused had done anything to the waiter (victim).

16     In these circumstances, I was doubtful that PW1 was telling the truth that he did not punch the victim at all. His evidence was inconsistent with PW6’s evidence and the contemporaneous text messages. I found PW1 to be not a reliable witness worthy of any credit.

## Evidence of Yu Ken Ming, Colin (PW3)

17     PW 3 was a casual acquaintance of the Accused and PW1. PW3 admitted that he was a good friend of PW4.

18     PW3 testified that when he and PW4 were at the console choosing songs at the corner of the room, he heard a commotion and he saw the Accused and a waiter involved in the altercation. He claimed that he was not aware that PW1 was involved in the altercation. He claimed that when he turned around, PW1 was already pinned at the other corner of the room.

19     PW3 said there was a kick by the Accused and then the victim was on ground. Accused then “semi-bent” over to throw some punches on the victim. This was the sequence. He was unsure whether the victim fell because of the kick. He reiterated that at this moment, PW1 was pinned against the other corner of the room. PW4 then went over to pull the Accused away. PW3 could not see exactly where the Accused punched the waiter but it was on the upper torso. He cannot tell how forceful the punches were. PW4 went over after the punches by the Accused. He believed PW4 wanted to break up the fight and prevent further punches. PW4 also went over to PW1 and then walked over to the victim who was lying on the floor and asked him to leave. PW4 used his foot to push the victim who was on the floor. It was a slight nudge at his head to ask the victim to leave. See Day 1 Transcript at page 81, lines 2 – 13. After the nudge, there was no further physical contact by PW4 on the victim.

20     I found PW3 was not forthright when he gave evidence. This can be seen during his cross-examination at Day1 Transcript at pages 85-87.

> QSo when you said earlier that you were distracted by a commotion between the accused and the victim, where were the accused and the victim at that time when you were distracted by their commotion.

> AYour Honour, they were within my line of sight near the location where I indicated together in the photo.

> QPlease look at the photos and tell me again where?

> AYour Honour, it’s a picture C where I marked B---B and R.

> QB and R.

> AYes, Your Honour.

> QB is---

> AOh, sorry. Uh, you are referring---can you repeat your question again?

> QWhere was the accused and the victim when their commotion attracted your attention?

> AUh, Your Honour, they were at the corner of the 2 table where, I mean, you know, the---the location is where I marked previously B plus R.

> QYah. What did you mark earlier B and R?

> AB and R.

> QWho’s B and who’s R?

> AB is for Mr. Bobby, R for Mr. ‘Robin’.

> QOkay. I’m a little confused. Who was standing at the bottom of the pool table again?

> AYour Honour, it was the victim, the waiter.

> QIt was what?

> AUh, Your Honour, you---

>> Uh, you’re referring to who was standing at the bottom, uh,

>> who’s lying down or?

> QNo---no---no. If photograph C, you indicated B and R---

> AYah.

> Qto represent Bobby and ‘Robin’, is it?

> AThat’s correct.

> QSo are you saying that Bobby and ‘Robin’ was standing at the end of the pool table in picture C?

> AUh, Your Honour, that will depend on the sequence and which---which timing was that are you referring to.

> QYou said that you were at the console together with Maynard and you were distracted by a commotion in the other end of the room which is where the pool table is, right, and you then said that there was a commotion between the accused and the waiter, is it?

> ATo my recollection, yes---yes, correct.

> QOkay. Then why did you say that B and R was standing at the end of that pool table meaning Bobby and ‘Robin’?

> AUh, Your Honour, I was assuming that they were there before the actual commotion started.

> QYou were assuming, I’m not asking for your assumption. I’m asking you questions based on what you told the Court. You told the Court that you were at the console with Maynard choosing songs for 10 minutes and you were---

> AThat’s---

> Qthen---

> Acorrect.

> Qdistracted by a commotion at the end of the pool table and when you looked in that direction, you saw the accused and the waiter at the end of the pool table, is that what you told the Court earlier?

> AYes, it was.

> QYes. Now, then why did you indicate B and R at the end of the pool table to represent Bobby and ‘Robin’ as opposed to the waiter at ‘Robin’?

> AUh, Your Honour, I must be mistaken on that point then.

> QYou must be mistaken on that point. Okay. Let’s give you the benefit of the doubt. So what are you saying now, who’s standing at the end of the pool table?

> AYour Honour, are you referring to the time when I noticed commotion?

> QYes.

> AThen it will be Mr. ‘Robin’ and the waiter.

21     These exchanges between counsel and PW3 indicated clearly that PW3 was wavering in his testimony and was not forthright. This was also evident when counsel asked whether PW4 stomped his foot on the waiter or near the waiter, PW3 replied that he cannot recall this. See Day 1 Transcript at page 95, lines28-31. However, when the learned DPP asked him to clarify whether he was saying it happened but he cannot remember or it did not happen, PW3 expectedly replied he meant it did not happen. If so, why was it that he did not disagree when he was cross-examined by counsel on this issue? In fact, PW4 admitted in the contemporaneous test messages that he did stamp/stomp the victim. See D1, tab 3 at page 8. PW3 also said he cannot recall that PW1 punched the victim which was contrary to the victim’s evidence that it was PW1 who punched him. See Day 2 Transcript at page 33, lines 9 to 17.

22     PW3 was also unsure of how many punches were executed by the Accused. PW3 merely said, “I cannot exactly say it’s more than 1, it could be 1 or 2”. See Day 1 Transcript at page 101, line 16. Clearly, PW3 was not a truthful witness.

23     I also found PW3 to be making up story as he went along. For instance, when asked about the commotion, PW3 said the commotion that distracted him was the raised voices. However, he was not sure whose voice was it. He then qualified it to say that he cannot make out whose voice as the ambience noise was loud. If so, how could he be distracted? He further qualified it to say the noise was louder.

24     I also noted that during the examination in chief, PW3 was unable to identify positively that the Accused punched the victim at his face or head. He merely said the upper torso area. Moreover, he could not tell how forceful the punches were.

25     The sequence of the assault as alleged by PW3 was - kick, victim fell and there were punches on his upper torso. However, the victim’s evidence was that he was slapped, punched and fell and while on the floor, he felt many kicks were rained at him.

26     Besides, the material inconsistencies with the other prosecution witnesses’ evidence, based on PW3’s evidence, there was no allegation that the Accused had kicked at the victim’s face. In fact, up to this stage, there was no clear evidence that the Accused had kicked or punched the victim’s face.

27     The other allegation by PW3 that PW4 used his leg to nudge at the victim’s head was also inconsistent with PW4’s evidence that he nudged at the victim’s hip area. See Day 1 Transcript at page116, lines16-17.

28     In these circumstances, I did not think PW3’s evidence was worthy of much weight. It only showed there were inconsistencies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

## Evidence of Loo Hui Xin, Maynard (PW4)

29     I found PW4 was evasive in giving evidence. His evidence was also not consistent.

30     PW4 testified that with reference to exhibit D4, photograph A, at the material time he was at DJ box at the far right. PW3 was in front of him. Accused was at the middle long sofa. PW1 was near the pool table. PW4 heard the commotion and turned around. The commotion was coming from behind. When he turned around PW3 pulled him over and told him not to be involved reminding him that he was getting married soon. Nevertheless, PW4 ran forward to grab the Accused over his waist as he saw him crouching over a person. PW4 marked “R” at photograph B of D4 to indicate the position of the Accused at that time. PW4 further elaborated that with the Accused’s back facing him; he saw the Accused punched the victim twice. I noted that this is inconsistent with the evidence of the victim who said he was certain it was PW1 who had punched him. PW4 claimed that his view of the victim was blocked by the Accused. I noted that there was no confirmation at all by PW4 that he saw the Accused punching the victim’s face.

31     PW4 also testified that the Accused told him why he was not doing anything to help when “your brother” was in trouble. He also claimed his watch was dislodged when he pulled the Accused. He then passed the watch to the Accused and walked to PW1 to ask him what was happening. He handed over the watch in case it would be misplaced or damaged. I found it to be incredible that a watch could be dislodged when PW4 was merely pulling the Accused. Given the fact that PW4 had just witnessed the altercation involving his friend, I agreed with the Defence that if “Maynard was not involved in the altercation, there would have been no need for Maynard to pass his watch to the Accused for safekeeping**”**. If it was for safekeeping, there was no reason why he cannot keep it himself. Moreover, why would PW3 said PW4 thanked him for holding him back if what PW4 did was merely to stop the Accused. There was also an admission by PW4 that a waiter held him back. See D1, tab3, page 8, time stamp 23/10/17 at 1:32:03pm. In my view, it must be that PW4 wanted to lend a hand to his friends in assaulting the victim. This was consistent with his own admission at D1, tab 3 at page 8.

32     PW4 alleged that he went over to the victim and fake kicked him and nudged him at the buttock hip area. He claimed that what he did was mere kicking action on the victim or just fake stomping. I found this aspect of the evidence ridiculous and incredible. Why was there a need to fake any kicking action? It would be more reasonable for him to come and protect his friends or to further register their anger by forceful kicking than mere fake action. It could not be that he did it in response to the Accused’s statement for not helping a brother and not showing his loyalty and friendship towards PW1. More importantly, his allegation of fake kicking or stomping was inconsistent with the contemporaneous text exchanges between the parties before anyone was charged. For example, D1 tab 1 – group chat that included the Accused, PW1 and PW4, at page 134 dated 21 October 2017, soon after the incident, time stamp 1: 50:55 pm to 1:51:43pm – Accused implied that PW1 gave a punch while PW4 did a Northern leg-kick. PW4 clearly knew that the Accused was referring to PW4 kicking the waiter/victim. However, in court he denied the kicking and said he did not think much about it. He claimed it was a nonsensical text by the Accused and therefore he did not reply to it. Again, I found this to be unbelievable. I was of the view that this was a serious statement and if PW4 did not do any “northern leg” there was no reason for him not to protest as it was not consistent with his own evidence that it was a fake kick or nudging action as he alleged. On the contrary, on a private chat with the Accused at D1, tab 3 at page 8, PW4 admitted that he felt guilty, stupid and foolish to “stamp him” after the Accused texted “Boby say you stamp that guy, his jaw crack…because you mad…”. These exchanges took place 2 days after the incident and after PW1 had broadcasted in the group chat that the victim was hospitalized. At 1:32:03, D1, tab3, on the same day (23 October 2017), PW4 added, “never stamp very hard”. In my view, this was inconsistent with his testimony when confronted with the text chats on 21 October 2017 that he did not reply as he found it nonsensical. He was clearly not consistent in his own testimony. In the context of martial art, clearly no one would have coined the term “Northern kick” to indicate a mere nudging action. It must be a forceful kick.

33     By 21 October 2017, time stamp 1:52:07 (D1, tab1 at page 134), the whole group including PW4 and the Accused knew that the victim was hospitalised. They must have known by then that the matter was serious and that explained why PW1 remarked “hope he don’t report police”. In fact, PW4 knew by 23 October 2017 that the victim’s finger was also broken. See time stamp 23 October 2017 at 1:33:07, D1, tab3 at page 8. He had also already heard that the victim’s jaw cracked before 23 October 2017. See Day 1 Transcript at page 126. He also disclosed that when he related the incident the next day to his family, they were worried for him. See Day 1 Transcript at page 127. In this context, clearly PW4 was trying to defend himself and downplay his role when text chatting with the Accused on 23 October 2017. He claimed that he did not know and that when he went over, the victim was already on the floor with both his hands covering his face. But he did admit he felt guilty and foolish to have stamped the victim. See page 8 of D1, tab 3.

34     The credibility of PW4 was also questionable as illustrated in D1, tab 3 – the series of WhatsApp exchanges between PW4 and the Accused. In particular, PW4 was referred to page 8, the highlighted portion of D1, tab3. He was asked at page 146 of Day 1 Transcript:

> QOkay. Now, then why didn’t you say that you’re action only, lah, instead you say, “No, lah, I stomped his buttock”. Why did you say that you stomped his buttock and not “an action only, lah, I pretend only, lah, I fake only, lah.” Why didn’t you say that?

> ABecause like I mentioned earlier, he saw that it was a fake stomping.

> QAnd then, you went on to say, “Then, waiter behind pull me….. also never stomp very hard”. Would you like to elaborate on this? Why did you say this?

> ABecause there is no possible reason which first of all, I was in a happy mode. There’s no point carry---I’ve never have history of violence. For me, my stand is very clear. I just want this episode to be over wave (sic), so that we can continue celebrate my, uh---my wedding party.”

35     In my view, PW4 was both untruthful and evasive. These conversations exhibited in D1, tab3, took place on 23 October 2017 from about 1:31pm. The incident should be still fresh in everyone’s mind. No one had been charged yet. When asked to explain why at the last highlighted sentence of tab 3, D1, at page 8, when he said, “Yes, I feel very guilty too, it’s very stupid and foolish for me to stamp him really…”. Instead of explaining, he was evasive as can be seen in his answer at page 148 of Day 1 Transcript – “because first of all, Colin actually pull me to prevent me from going over because I was getting married soon. Secondly, thinking back on the incident, I will actually went (sic) over to fake---fake him because of a statement that ‘Robin’s---‘Robin’ made. And I didn’t want to disappoint, make him feel angry.”

36     Another instance of PW4’s inconsistency was when asked at page 150 of Day 1 Transcript: “I put to you that the injuries to the waiter was certainly not caused by my client, first of all, stomping the---would you agree or disagree with my statement or you have no comments?” He answered no comments. However, during his re-examination PW4 said that before he passed his watch to the Accused, the latter did punch the waiter but no further contact after PW4 had passed the watch to the Accused.

37     Given the instances of inconsistencies in his evidence and his evasiveness, I was of the view that PW4 was not a truthful witness. His evidence in court was self-serving. Accordingly, I gave little or no weight to his evidence.

## Testimony of Yuan Shu Feng

38     Yuan Shu Feng (PW5) also known as Michelle testified that the victim snatched away the glass of champagne offered to her by PW1. PW1 became angry and used his right hand to slap the victim on his face. The victim was injured and sent to hospital. She paid the medical bill of about $1000 and PW1 refunded it to her. Before she went to the hospital, PW1 told her that he would foot the medical bill.

39     PW5 knew PW4 and PW1 for about 2years. She did not know the Accused too well.

40     After the slap, PW5 claimed that she went out and therefore did not see PW1 hit the victim further.

41     PW5 confirmed that she told PW1 the injuries suffered by the victim – broken left ring finger and that she noticed his left face was bruised. At the hospital, the victim told her that he suffered a fractured jaw.

42     PW5 admitted that PW1 reimbursed her the medical fees she paid. PW1 also offered to compensate the victim to settle the matter. The victim proposed $200,000. However, PW1 refused to pay the $200,000 proposed.

43     During her cross-examination, PW5 testified that PW4 at the material time was seated at the sofa marked “ML” on photo A of D5. Next to ML was PW3. This position was different from PW4’s testimony that he was at the small monitor away from the photographer.

44     PW5 also indicated on D5, photo A, the respective positions of PW1, herself and W for waiter/victim (marked by red marker near the water bottle). They were all standing in between the table and big TV. “R” on D5, photo A represented the Accused sitting on the sofa. D5, photo B at position ‘X’ was where the victim was after he had been slapped.

45     PW5 claimed that he did not see PW1 punched the victim causing him to fall onto the ground. Neither did she see PW4 handed his watch over to the Accused and charged over to kick at the victim who was lying on the floor.

46     PW1 had told PW5 to visit the victim and make payment. She was not aware that PW4 offered to pay $50,000 towards the $200,000.

47     Essentially, PW5’s evidence was that she only saw PW1 slapped the victim. She did not say that she witnessed the Accused hitting the victim at all. Neither did she see PW1 punched the victim. In this context, her evidence did not assist in the prosecution’s case.

## Evidence of Ho Swee On (PW7)

48     Ho Swee On (PW7), was a waiter for about 20 years at Lido Palace. On the day in question, PW7 was not on duty at the room where the incident took place. He claimed that before he went into that room he heard noises like quarrelling coming from inside the room. He then went into the room. On opening the door, he saw someone kicking Ah Hua – Ng Ming Hua (PW6) who then fell onto the ground. That someone was identified to be the Accused. He had a clear view. When the victim was kicked, he was at D7, photograph D marked “W” for the victim and “R” for the Accused. But he did not see which part of the victim’s body did the Accused kick. He cannot identify whether it was the victim’s upper or lower body that the Accused was alleged to have kicked.

49     PW7 confirmed after repeatedly questioned by the learned DPP that the Accused did not do anything else to the victim after the victim had fallen onto the floor. See Day 2 Transcript at page 50, line12 to page 51, line 18. This would seem to suggest that there was no punches by the Accused. Upon seeing the victim fallen onto the floor, PW7 quickly went out to call for help. Hence, he did not continue to look at the victim. PW7 also testified that he did not see PW4 or PW1 hit the victim**.**

50     At D7, photograph C, PW7 marked the respective positions of PW1 and PW4 as “B” and “M” respectively.

51     Surprisingly when counsel put to him that his main agenda in court was to claim that he saw the Accused kicked the victim and everything else not important that was why he was vague about his answers to other questions and PW7 agreed.

52     When re-examined by the learned DPP to clarify his last answer to counsel, PW7 also agreed that his main agenda in court was to testify that he saw the Accused kicked the victim. Later he corrected himself and said what he said in court was true. He claimed that he did not fabricate the evidence and his testimony was based on his recollection.

53     Having reviewed his evidence and that of the other prosecution witnesses, I found PW7 to be not a credible witness worthy of any credit. As highlighted by counsel, “the spot where Ho alleged the kick took place was totally nonsensical and cuts against the testimonies of every other witness.” PW7 was the only witness that alleged that the assault took place at the position marked by him at photograph D of D7.

54     Next, despite testifying during his EIC that he had a clear when he saw the kicking yet he “did not see which part of Ng’s body did the Accused kick. Ho could not even say whether Ng was kicked in the upper half or lower half of his body.” Nevertheless, he was able to say, “I saw accused kick Ah Hua and Ah Hua fell onto the ground”. See Day 2 Transcript at page 50. This was clearly unbelievable.

55     In short, I agreed with the Defence that PW7’s sole agenda was to lie in court that he saw the Accused kicked the victim. He did not go so far as to identify which part of the victim that was kicked even though he had a clear view. Moreover, PW7’s testimony as to where the assault took place also differed from the other prosecution witnesses. Hence, I did not give any weight to PW7’s evidence. In any event, even if there was a kick by the Accused, PW7 was unable to say that the kick was at the victim’s face causing him to fall.

## The Defence

56     The Accused elected to give evidence in his defence. He also called Cheng Chee Kien also known as Marc (DW2) to give evidence for his defence.

57     DW2 was not at the scene at the material time when the incident took place. He was a mere participant in the chat group after the event. Whatever he had heard were after the event and clearly hearsay. He can only provide evidence as to the nature of the relationship between all the relevant parties. Hence, much of the evidence DW2 gave in court were irrelevant. I will also not give too much weight on its corroborative value as most of his evidence were far after the incident had taken place.

## Evidence of Accused

58     From 20 October 2017 to 21 October 2017, PW1, PW4, PW3 and the Accused were at Lido Palace. While there, the Accused sat on the sofa facing the TV. PW1 was on his left. Accused marked on exhibit D8 the respective positions of PW1, PW5, the victim, and himself.

59     The Accused witnessed PW1, PW5 and the victim were snatching over the glass of brandy. It culminated with PW1 slapping and punching the victim. The Accused intervened but PW4 pulled him away. When PW1 slapped the victim, PW5 reacted by standing between PW1 and the victim.

60     The Accused claimed that he never assaulted the victim at all. He attributed it to him being pulled away by PW4 at that particular time.

61     Exhibit D1, tab1 at page 134 were the text messages after the incident. The Accused explained that the punch on the victim was by PW1 and the kick by PW4 Maynard. In martial art, there was a saying that the Northern leg and the Southern first were the best; the Accused used such phrases to distract PW1 and PW4. It was just a joke about them kicking and punching the victim. See day 3 Transcript at page 19. There was no reply to his remarks about the kick by PW4 and punch by PW1. The Accused claimed he was serious in his WhatsApp chats.

62     At D1, tab 4 page 3, time stamp 3 January 2018 at 11:24:02am, it stated “Even I said, I saw Maynard go crazy and stamp kick on the waiter, but I did say I didn’t see where he stamp the waiter. I always say the truth.” Accused explained that he was expressing his disappointment to DW2 and he related it to his statements given to the Police. This could not be an afterthought as the Accused gave his 1st statement to the Police on 18 January 2018 and his 2nd statement on 12 February 2018.

63     The Accused also gave evidence angled to explain why he chose to lie to the police in his first statement. This can be discerned from the various text messages and his evidence in court. For instance, exhibit D1, tab 3, page 20, dated 27 December 2017, where the Accused expressed that “this time serious” after he had spoken to PW1. He wanted to meet up with PW4 to discuss with him how to help PW1. When referred to this text, the Accused explained that after PW1 was charged, PW4 wanted to meet him. They met and PW4 wanted him to lie to police that “Bobby snatching the brandy and the victim kicked Bobby, after that Bobby punched and both of them fall onto the floor and the rest you didn’t see anything”. However, there was no follow up. On the other hand, the Accused did follow up with PW4 when he texted at page 23, on 15 January 2018 at 4:26:40pm “what you guys want me to say?” as PW4 had told him to make a false statement during their last meeting at Cantonment food court. At D1, tab 3, page 25, 16 January 2018 – last sentence was from the Accused to PW4 as to whether the story that he asked him to cook up was still valid. But PW4 did not reply. This was consistent with D1, tab2 at page 8, time-stamp 27 December 2017 at 3:49:43 pm where the Accused mentioned that he had asked PW4 for coffee to discuss how to help PW1.

64     On 18 January 2018 at 10.30am, the Accused gave his 1st statement to the police. He lied in this statement by not stating that he saw PW1 punched and PW4 kicked. The Accused explained that he did not tell the truth to the police as PW1 and PW4 were his friends for many years.

65     D1, exhibit tab 4 page 10, dated 17 January 2018 – the Accused texted this message to DW2 “I felt very sad that I cannot help Bobby to eat dead cat for the punch. Main reason, I don’t know the punishment how heavy.” Accused elaborated in court that he could not help PW1 as he did not know how serious would be the consequences.

66     Accused alleged that on 17 January 2018, PW1 mentioned to DW2 whether the Accused could take over the punch and stomp. DW2 passed this message on 17 January and the Accused replied to DW2 that he could not take over the stomp as many witnessed it but he can take over the punch. He explained that he was prepared to do it for PW1 because of their long friendship and his family. This allegation was not captured in the WhatsApp chat. He explained “dead cat” to mean, “you didn’t do it but you admit to it”.

67     D1, tab 4, page 13 – on 18 January 2018 at 9:43:44pm, by which time, the Accused had engaged lawyer. Accused said to DW2 that he had decided not to help PW1 for the punches as his lawyer had advised him that it was a serious offence. In his 1st statement at P4 recorded on 18 January 2018 at 10:30am, the Accused stated that he saw PW1 slapped the victim and an unknown person punched the victim. He did not mention that PW1 had punched the victim. However, in court he asserted that PW1 punched and PW4 stomped the victim. Before the punch, PW1 slapped the victim. The Accused claimed that he did not hit the victim.

68     During cross-examination, the Accused denied that he was desperate for PW1 to go to jail to take the blame for what he did, after the learned DPP referred to pages 5, 6 and 7 of D1, tab 2 from 23 December to 26 December 2017. In D1 tab 2, at pages 6, 7, 8, 9 – over 4 occasions, it indicated that the Accused wanted to know from PW1 what his lawyer had discussed with him. He disagreed that this showed he was afraid that PW1 might change his mind about taking the blame for him after meeting his lawyer. With respect, I did not agree that there was clear contemporaneous evidence to support the suggestion that the Accused wanted PW1 to take the blame for him. The Accused also said if “I want to ask Bobby to take all the charges. Then why should I lie to police?” He added that it would be better for him to inform the Police that PW1 punched the victim. Hence, there was no reason for him to lie in the police statement to help himself. The Accused also explained that he asked about what the lawyer said to PW1 because he was concerned for him. This seemed to be a reasonable explanation given the fact that they were friends for many years and socialised a lot.

69     I agreed with the Prosecution that there were inconsistencies in the Accused’s evidence. The Accused agreed with the learned DPP that he said in court that PW4 stamped---stomped 3 times at least on the victim. However, in P4 (the 1st police statement), Accused did not mention that he saw PW4 stomped the victim. The discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that at that the time when P4 was made, there were indications that there was a plan to cover up the situation. This can be seen in D1, tab2 at page 8, time-stamp 27 December 2017 at 3:49:43 pm where the Accused mentioned that he had asked PW4 for coffee to discuss how to help PW1.

70     Accused agreed that in the WhatsApp conversation he mentioned PW1 told him that PW4 stomped. This meant that the Accused did not see it by himself. However, at P5 (the 2nd police statement dated 12 February 2018) at paragraph 4, the Accused said “t(T)hen Maynard got angry and he asked me to hold his Apple watch. I kept it in my right-hand jeans pocket. He then dashed forward to the victim and stomped the victim many times but I cannot see if he is stomping the victim or stomping the floor near the victim.” Accused agreed that he did not see PW4 physically stomping on a specific part of the victim’s body. On the other hand, PW4 in his evidence admitted that he did use his leg to nudge the victim.

71     P4 dated 18 January 2018 was the Accused’s statement before he was charged. He agreed that by December 2017, he suspected that PW4 and PW1 were conspiring against him and the Accused agreed that therefore he had nothing to gain by covering up for PW1 or PW4. The Accused explained that at that time, he decided to lie as he had no concrete evidence that PW1 and PW4 were plotting against him even though he knew that it was an offence to give false statement to the police.

72     Accused also asserted that despite the fact that P5 was given on 12 February 2018 (same day as he was charged) he could remember many things to the extent of providing a drawing of the room and people in the room that day. He denied P5 was a fabrication to implicate PW1 and PW4. The Accused explained that he was shocked to be charged. Hence, he decided to tell the truth in his second police statement dated 12 February 2018.

73     In D1, tab 2, page 12, at timestamp, 15/01/18, 5:36:46pm, the line highlighted in yellow where the Accused texted to PW1: “Night time, lor, I really want to know what you guys want me to say.” Moreover, at 7:16:57pm he texted to PW1 “Help me to ask him. I need to tell police what.” At tab 3, page 23, timestamp, 15/1/18, 4:26:40pm, the Accused said to PW4, “So, what you guys want me to say when you making statement?” However, there was no message from PW1 or PW4 before or after this, asking the Accused to give a particular version of events. It was alleged but the Accused disagreed it was a one-sided offer on his part. The Accused explained that by 26 December 2017 both PW1 and PW4 were distancing themselves from him. That was why they did not reply to his messages.

74     Accused was referred to his Case for the Defence (P7) filed by his lawyer at paragraph 17, “The accused suffered an injury to his right shoulder in or about 2001. Since then, he had been suffering from chronic shoulder instability such that his right shoulder would dislocate easily. Because of this, the accused always consciously not exert his right shoulder, so as not to trigger a shoulder dislocation which is very painful. But he would not, could not, and did not punch or kick or come into any physical contact with Ng on 21st October 2017”. Accused agreed this was not raised in his evidence in court. He disagreed that was because it was not true.

## Submissions by Prosecution

75     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s account of events has continuously evolved over time, underscoring his guilt and his lack of credibility. Moreover, the Accused failed to explain for his inconsistency in his evidence. I found the Accused indeed did provide a version in court, which differed from his statements to the police. The details were as stated in the Prosecution’s written submissions at pages 13 -15. With respect, I disagreed that the Accused had failed to provide a credible explanation for the inconsistency. The Accused’s explanation was that he lied because of his friendship with PW1 and PW4 even though he suspected by 26 December 2017 that PW4 and PW1 were conspiring against him. Before the Accused was charged, he even texted, at page 23, D1 tab3, on 15 January 2018 at 4:26:40pm “what you guys want me to say?” He appeared to have continued to value their friendship. When he lied in his first statement dated 18 January 2018, the Accused was yet to be named as an accused. Given this context, I cannot totally discount the Accused’s explanation.

76     The Accused has also explained why he finally told the truth in his second statement to the police. His explanation was that he was shocked to be charged and hence decided to tell the truth in his second police statement. I was of the view that this was not totally an incredible explanation.

77     It was contended that the WhatsApp messages were a one-sided attempt by the Accused to pin the blame on PW1 and PW4. However, as submitted by the Defence, “if the Accused had wanted to frame Bobby and Maynard, the Accused would not have given a false statement to the police on 18 Januaryuary 2018.” I also noted that most of the text messages were contemporaneous evidence and these messages were exchanged at a time when the Accused was yet to be charged. Hence, I would not completely rule out its reliability and truth. Moreover, the Prosecution did not challenge the admissibility of these messages or its authenticity. In any event, it was sufficient for the Accused to raise a reasonable doubt for him to be acquitted.

## Conclusion

78     Having considered the evidence and the submissions of the parties, I was of the view that the Prosecution has failed to discharge its burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The credibility of the main prosecution witnesses was questionable. There were allegations that there was kicking by the Accused but there was no conclusive evidence of the Accused punching the victim’s face causing him to sustain a fracture of the jaw. On the other hand, there were text messages suggesting that PW1 punched while PW4 kicked at the victim. Moreover, there was no contemporaneous text messages implicating the Accused. It was not for the Accused to prove his innocence.

79     Based on the evidence presented, I found that it was unsafe to convict the Accused. Accordingly, I found the Accused not guilty and acquitted him of the charge.
