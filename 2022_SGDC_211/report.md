Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing - Companies Act – Carrying on business for fraudulent purpose

12 September 2022

### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       Once again, I like to thank all parties for their respective submissions.

2       Both accused persons (collectively “**the Accused Persons**”), Iseli Rudolf James Maitland (“**James**”) and How Soo Feng (“**Sue**”) were each convicted of an offence under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (the “**Companies Act**”) on 1 September 2022 (see _PP v Iseli Rudolf James Maitland and How Soo Feng_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 204</span>). I now deliver my judgment for sentencing.

3       The foremost sentencing consideration in the present case is undoubtedly one of deterrence and retribution.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The Accused Persons knowingly ran a Ponzi scheme that was inherently unsustainable with no substantive profit-generating business or investment activities. TGL Pte Ltd’s (“**TGL**”) gold buyback scheme promised substantial pay-outs to lure unsuspecting victims to buy into the GD and GSS contracts. A strong signal must be sent to deter against such dishonest practices that have no purpose other than to gain financially at the expense of unwitting customers.

4       The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 340(5) read with s 340(1) of the Companies Act is a fine not exceeding $15,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both. Here, a custodial term is clearly warranted based on the nature and scale of the offence and the need for deterrence. The appropriate length of imprisonment may be assessed according to well-established sentencing parameters in terms of the harm caused by the offence, as well as the culpability of the Accused Persons. I also take into account the principle of sentencing parity by juxtaposing the relative culpabilities of James and Sue vis-à-vis Gary who had been sentenced to 2 years and 10 months’ imprisonment for a similar charge.

## Harm caused and losses suffered

5       In respect of the harm caused, TGL operated and sold the GD and GSS contracts on a massive scale. During the period that James and Sue managed TGL, the company sold 3,510 gold buyback contracts to 2,247 unique customers[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). Within the span of less than a year (from 16 December 2009 to 7 October 2010), the revenue brought in through these contracts amounted to about $121 million.[^3] As of 7 October 2010, TGL’s pay-out and buyback obligations to clients under the contracts amounted to over $85 million.[^4] However, TGL only had $452,364.28 in the bank accounts[^5] and was clearly unable to fulfil its buyback obligations.

6       For clients who were unable to sell back their gold to TGL, they would have suffered losses as the gold were bought at a substantial markup of about 24% above the prevailing gold retail price on average.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) In this regard, with respect, I do not agree in so far as the Defence appears to suggest that there were no quantifiable losses.[^7] The losses suffered can be quantified by calculating the premium over the prevailing gold retail price that were paid on gold buyback contracts that remained outstanding as of 7 October 2010.[^8] This amounted to $12,918,185 if one were to take the sales value of contracts that remained unfulfilled as of 7 October 2010 ($76,632,440) minus the aggregate consideration clients could receive if they were to liquidate the gold bars in their possession on 7 October 2010 ($63,714,255).[^9] Clearly, substantial losses were caused.

## Culpability of the Accused Persons

7       In respect of culpability, James and Sue were directors and majority shareholders with overriding control in TGL. They had oversight of the business and remained apprised of TGL’s affairs through updates and reports from Janet and Joanne. They had the power to and were capable of making key business and financial decisions on behalf of the company. On top of the influence and authority they wielded in TGL, they were also shareholders in SWM and led the sales and marketing efforts to ensure that TGL continued to sell more gold and buyback contracts. Both James and Sue personally profited through the directors’ fees from TGL, as well as the commissions earned through SWM. In summary, the Accused Persons benefitted handsomely by virtue of their positions held in TGL and SWM.

> (a)     Based on TGL’s records, $1,196,447.30 was paid in directors fees between July 2009 to March 2010.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) This means James and Sue received $598,223.65 in directors’ fees, as FTEG would have been paid the other half.

> (b)     SWM earned a net profit of $337,551.05 for the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010, and $110,664.80 for the period spanning 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2010 respectively.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) Sue’s agency was paid almost $200,000 as sales commission between March 2010 and October 2010.[^12]

8       Further, James and Sue operated a sophisticated gold buyback scheme under a deliberate guise of legitimacy. TGL had represented itself to clients as being a legitimate business that “abides by the laws of Singapore” and that it had “sought further clarification with financial authorities”.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) Sales agent were taught how to explain to potential clients that TGL was not a Ponzi scheme, and that profits could be made through a “formula” when in truth there was none. Both James and Sue knew from the outset that the “formula” was nothing more than a façade to cloak the business with a veneer of legitimacy. With this artifice, they dishonestly allowed the gold buyback scheme to be falsely marketed to sales agents, employees and clients. I now turn to the issue of sentencing parity.

## Sentencing parity vis-à-vis Gary

9       As Menon CJ pointed out in the case of _Chong Han Rui v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> (“_Chong Han Rui_”), sentences meted out to co-offenders who are party to a common enterprise should not be unduly disparate from each other. An offender who has a more culpable role in a criminal enterprise should be dealt with more severely than an accomplice who played a lesser role: _Chong Han Rui_ at \[42\]. In my judgment, there are several factors that indicate that James and Sue had played a greater role than Gary within the TGL enterprise.

> (a)     First, the roles played by James and Sue in terms of driving the sales and marketing for TGL’s buyback schemes cannot be understated. For a Ponzi scheme that has no substantive profit-generating activities to operate, its continued existence is crucially dependent on fresh inflow of new clients and revenue to pay off the old clients. Put another way, the sales and marketing efforts helmed by James and Sue were the lifeblood of TGL that enabled the Ponzi scheme to subsist for the duration of the offence.

> (b)     Second, James and Sue had the overriding control and authority within TGL. During the board of directors meeting dated 21 April 2010, James and Sue were able to effectively override Gary’s objection, and withhold payment of directors’ fees to FTEG. They were also able to pay commissions to SWM without Gary’s approval. Significantly, even after Gary and FTEG’s representatives had stopped going into office sometime in May/June 2010, James and Sue were able to make decisions on pricing of gold bars.

> (c)     Third, and closely related to the second point above, after Gary and FTEG’s representatives had stopped going into office sometime in May/June 2010, James and Sue were effectively the ones running the company together with Joanne. There was, in other words, a longer and more substantial degree of involvement by James and Sue in the company. Their period of offending (approximately 10 months) was also slightly longer as compared to Gary’s charge (approximately 9 months) as reflected in their respective charges.

> (d)     Fourth, James and Sue benefitted to a larger extent compared to Gary. Unlike Gary who was largely remunerated through directors’ fees, James and Sue (who were also paid directors’ fees) had an additional stream of income and was able to reap financial gains from commissions paid to SWM. Even though James and Sue had paid Gary for FTEG’s shares in TGL,[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) I found that they only did so in order to cover up the Ponzi scheme that was soon to be exposed.[^15]

10     Gary pleaded guilty and was eventually sentenced to 2 years and 10 months’ imprisonment. There are certain limitations in ascertaining how the sentence was eventually arrived at as there was no grounds of decision released for Gary’s case. Nonetheless, I observe that the 2 years and 10 months’ imprisonment imposed by the court was also the sentence sought for by the prosecution. The prosecution argued that Gary’s plea of guilt was not a genuine expression of remorse or contrition for his crimes.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) However, the prosecution did not appear to have taken a position with regard to any sentencing discount that may have been given to Gary for the saving of State resources which would otherwise have been expended if there had been a trial.

11     Having considered the circumstances of Gary’s plea of guilt and sentence, with respect, I am unable to agree with the Defence’s argument that Gary’s sentence would not have been substantially different had he claimed trial.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) Neither can I agree with the Defence’s argument that Sue should get a lower sentence than Gary because she did not evade the law.[^18] Even though Gary absconded and was later apprehended, he nevertheless chose to plead guilty despite having the opportunity to claim trial. Gary’s plea of guilt averted the need for a re-trial of James’ and Sue’s ongoing case, and obviated the need to prove Gary’s charge _via_ a trial. Significant judicial and prosecutorial resources and time were therefore saved, and this would have been factored into Gary’s eventual sentence notwithstanding his earlier act of absconding.

12     I accept that James’ and Sue’s sentence should not receive an uplift on the basis that they chose to claim trial, as this would convey the misimpression that the Accused Persons are being penalised for claiming trial. Instead, in order to ensure parity between Gary and the Accused Persons, it would be appropriate to consider what sentence would likely have been imposed on Gary if he had claimed trial: see _Lim Hong Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 200</span> (“_Lim Hong Boon_”) at \[32\]. The joint trial of James and Sue lasted for 29 days and provided a sense of the amount of resources that would have had to be expended to prove Gary’s charge at trial. I am thus of the view that had Gary decided to claim trial, his putative non-discounted sentence could have been an imprisonment term of between 3.5 years or even close to 4 years.

13     Next, I find that there are no mitigating factors to James’ and Sue’s credit in this case. Despite the overwhelming evidence against both of them at trial, they were unrepentant and came up with various excuses to downplay their knowledge or distance themselves from the fraudulent scheme which they knowingly perpetrated. They scarcely displayed any remorse, and accordingly no sentencing discount ought to be given to both Accused Persons. By virtue of their heightened culpabilities vis-à-vis Gary, I am overall unconvinced by the Defence’s sentencing positions that James and Sue should receive a lower sentence than Gary. To the contrary, I am of the view that an uplift from Gary’s sentence of 2 years and 10 months’ imprisonment is amply justified.

## Comparison with case precedents

14     In calibrating the eventual sentence to be imposed, I find the recent case of _Lim Hong Boon_ to be relevant. The offender in _Lim Hong Boon_ was convicted, following a trial, of a single charge under s 340(5) of the Companies Act. In that case, the company owed to customers about 672.015kg of gold with a market value of $46.85 million (_Lim Hong Boon_ at \[7\]). The harm caused would appear to be higher than the losses suffered by TGL’s clients in this case of about $12.9 million, and hence a downward adjustment to the sentence in the present case may be applied.

15     However, the offender in _Lim Hong Boon_ was not the directing mind and will, even though he had knowledge of the scale and extent of the criminality taking place and played an essential role in the gold inspection exercise (_Lim Hong Boon_ at \[22\] to \[25\]). On appeal, the High Court revised his sentence downwards from 60 months’ imprisonment to 48 months’ imprisonment. In the present case, James and Sue (together with Gary) were the masterminds behind the fraudulent scheme ran by TGL, and the sentences to be imposed should reflect their higher degree of culpabilities.

16     For completeness, I note that the High Court in _Lim Hong Boon_ did not find _Phang Wah and others v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 646</span> (“_Phang Wah_”) to be of much assistance in respect of sentencing under s 340 Companies Act because of the other offences proceeded with in _Phang Wah_ (_Lim Hong Boon_ at \[33\]). For similar reasons, the reference to _Rahj Kamal bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 227</span> (“_Rahj Kamal_”) is of limited utility. In _Rahj Kamal_, the offender was convicted after a trial of 3 counts of cheating under s 420 Penal Code and 3 counts of fraudulent trading under s 340 Companies Act. On appeal, his sentence was enhanced to a global term of 8 years’ imprisonment. The Accused Persons in the present case each face a single charge under s 340 Companies Act. I do not see how any meaningful comparison could be made to the sentence in _Rahj Kamal_ apart from the fact that James and Sue will be looking at a sentence below 8 years’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

17     In the final analysis, having regard to all of the reasons stated above, as well as the sentencing precedent of _Lim Hong Boon_, I sentence both Accused Persons to 3 years’ and 10 months’ imprisonment. In my view, this will meet the need for retribution and serve as sufficient deterrence while proportionately reflecting the criminal responsibilities of the Accused Persons.

18     I am also of the view that the medical condition of James does not warrant any reduction in his sentence. There is no indication that his medical condition may cause the custodial sentence to have an impact that is out of proportion to the gravity of the offence committed.
