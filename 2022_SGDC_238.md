3       The discharge amounting to an acquittal on DAC 904831/2020 and DAC 904832/2020 was given on the Prosecution’s application at the close of the Defence’s case, based on their consideration of the evidence in trial.

4       The Accused’s appeal is in respect of the sentence only.

## Brief Facts of the Case

5       As adduced in trial, the brief facts of the case were:

> (a)     The victim in this case was one Dr Tan Jee Lim (“Dr Tan”), an orthopaedic surgeon in JL Sports Medicine and Surgery Pte Ltd, a clinic based in Gleneagles Medical Centre. The Accused became a patient of Dr Tan in 2015 when the Accused consulted Dr Tan on a foot condition[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1);

> (b)     After the Accused came to know that Dr Tan was accumulating US dollars and Sterling Pound for his children’s education overseas, the Accused told Dr Tan that he was able to obtain good foreign exchange rates “_better than what is available in the market, be it the banks or the retail money changers”_[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2);

> (c)     Subsequently, Dr Tan began to entrust large sums of money to the Accused. This begun from late April 2015 where in the beginning, Dr Tan received timely and profitable returns from the Accused from the foreign exchange (“forex”) trading. Dr Tan and the Accused shared the profits from such forex trading at 80% and 20% respectively;

> (d)     However, in the period from about 25 May 2015 to 5 August 2015, Dr Tan received no returns from the Accused in respect of monies handed over to the Accused. When the Accused was no longer contactable and Dr Tan realised that that he was not able to get his money back, he eventually lodged a police report on 20 August 2015[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3).

> (e)     Throughout Dr Tan’s testimony, he maintained that the entrustment of these monies to the Accused was solely for the purpose of forex trading done on his behalf[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4).

6       At the conclusion of trial, it was a key finding of the Court that the monies received by the Accused in all the five charges were entrusted to him by Dr Tan for the purpose of forex trading. There was no express or implied authority given to the Accused to use the monies in whatever way the Accused wished “_as long as there is a profit_”[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5), as claimed by the Accused. I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused did misappropriate the monies entrusted to him and did so dishonestly, by using them for his perfume business instead of forex trading. The total amount of money misappropriated by the Accused was a sum of $1,861,635.98.

## The Appropriate Sentence

### Approach in Sentencing

7       The starting consideration was the value of property misappropriated. In the case of _Public Prosecutor_ v _Lam Leng Hung and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 474</span> at \[367\] (“_Lam Leng Hung_”), this was made clear:

> _“We accept the general proposition that in respect of property offences, including that of CBT, the starting consideration ought to be the value of the property misappropriated. This principle has been reiterated in many cases. In Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 361</span> (“Philip Wong”), Chan Sek Keong J observed (at \[18\]) that in an offence like CBT, “it \[was\] a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court”.”_

8       As highlighted by the Prosecution in their Skeletal Sentencing Submissions[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6), whilst the value of the property misappropriated may be the starting point for the analysis of the appropriate sentence, the sentence is not derived by an application of a mathematical formula based on the amount in question. In _Lam Leng Hung_, the High Court stated the following:

> _“While the value of the property misappropriated ought ordinarily to be the starting point for the analysis of the appropriate sentence, it also bears emphasis that the court’s discretion in sentencing is never restricted to the application of a mathematical formula based on the amount in question (see, for example, the observations of Yong CJ in Amir Hamzah bin Berang Kuty v PP <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 617</span> at \[60\]). As Lee Seiu Kin J observed in Tan Cheng Yew (\[96\] supra) at \[184\], it is common sense that sentences for CBT offences do not bear a relationship of linear proportionality with the sums involved. The appropriate sentence to be imposed must be arrived at after having regard not just to the amounts in question, but also to the totality of the circumstances, particularly the specific facts of the case.”_

9       The consideration of the “_totality of the circumstances_” would include factors[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) such as:

> (a)     the impact of the offence on the victim;

> (b)     the nature of the relationship with the victim;

> (c)     the level of trust breached;

> (d)     the deliberate targeting of a vulnerable victim;

> (e)     the number of victims involved;

> (f)     the degree of premeditation;

> (g)     the length of offending;

> (h)     the impact of the offences on the public and public confidence;

> (i)     any non-financial harm to the victim;

> (j)     the motivation of the offender; and

> (k)     the use to which the money or property that was dishonestly taken was put.

### Reasons for the Sentence

10     The punishment prescribed for an offence under section 406 of the Penal Code is an imprisonment term of up to seven years, or with fine, or with both.

#### Value of Property Misappropriated

11     In this case, the amounts misappropriated in the charges ranged from $100,000 to $751,558. The total amount misappropriated was in excess of $1.8 million.

12     From a survey of the case precedents referred in the Prosecution’s written submissions, I was able to draw out sentences which were imposed on individual charges under section 406 of the Penal Code. The table below sets out the sentences with reference to the value of property misappropriated alone:

13     With the above indicative sentences (based on value of property alone) in mind, I considered the specific facts and circumstances of the case.

#### Overall Circumstances of the Case

14     In his mitigation, Defence Counsel highlighted the following, amongst other factors for consideration[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8):

> (a)     The breach of trust was “_on the low level_”[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9); the relationship between the Accused and Dr Tan were not “_contrived or designed because in the first $10 million transactions, they_ were _genuine transactions_”[^10];

> (b)     There was only one victim involved and Dr Lim was not a vulnerable victim whom the Accused had targeted;

> (c)     Circumstances (failed perfume business) had developed which caused the Accused to make a “_silly decision_”[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11); there was no premeditation;

> (d)     The motivation for the Accused’s action was “_not for self-gain” but “more to rescue himself from a hopeless situation_”. The Accused was “_driven by a complete desire to try and see how he could revive the situation”._[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

15     Focusing on the circumstances of the case, Defence Counsel sought an imprisonment term of two years on the first two charges (amounts of about $599,226 and $751,558 respectively); eight months imprisonment on the third and fifth charges (amounts of $100,000 and $100,054 respectively) and 15 months imprisonment on the fourth charge (amount involved was $310,797.98). It was Defence’s submission that a global sentence of three years and three months would be appropriate[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13). I found the proposed sentences to be inadequate.

16     I was of the view that Defence Counsel had understated the level of trust which had been breached in this case. Whilst I was mindful that the monetary transactions between the Accused and Dr Tan spanned over only a few months from late April 2015 to early August 2015 (as opposed to years in some cases), they were numerous, as was plain from the Excel spreadsheet[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) kept by Dr Tan of the trades he had made with the Accused. The interactions between the Accused and Dr Tan during the few months were also constant and lively, sometimes even personal, as evidenced by about 100-pages of the WhatsApp chat log[^15] tendered in evidence. The amounts which Dr Tan handed over to the Accused for forex trading were large amounts of money, mostly in the tune of hundreds of thousands. Taken cumulatively, all these were telling of a good measure of trust reposed in the Accused by Dr Tan.

17     The uncontrived nature of the relationship or the genuineness of the “_first $10 million transactions_”, whilst strengthening the Defence’s submission that the offences were not premeditated, do not mitigate the fact that a high level of trust had been breached by the Accused, given the nature of the relationship between the Accused and Dr Tan. In any case, as pointed out by the DPP, it was these initial genuine transactions which built up and established a strong relationship with a deep level of trust between the Accused and Dr Tan[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16), which trust was subsequently breached.

18     In terms of Accused’s motivation for the offence and how the misappropriated monies were used, I accept that there is no evidence before the court that the monies had been used by the Accused for any other purpose other than for his perfume business which was in dire straits[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17). The Accused used the monies, belonging to and handed to him by Dr Tan for forex trading, to help his own business. As Prosecution reminded: “_This is not a case involving an accused who was trying to rescue a charity. He was trying to rescue his own business. Essentially, he was channelling misappropriated monies towards his own purpose and agenda…..it is for self-enrichment and self-gain_”[^18]. The Accused may not have used the misappropriated sums directly for self-gratification in terms of buying luxury items but clearly, there was overriding self-interest involved when the Accused pumped the monies into his perfume business – conduct which ultimately would have benefitted himself, not third parties.

19     Two wrongs do not make one right. In mitigation, Accused maintained that his stock for the business had been stolen and he had been cheated; that he himself was a victim of someone else’s crime[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19). Even so, I did not find this to be of any mitigating value as there was simply no justification for the actions of the Accused.

20     What made the situation worse was after the Accused had used the monies for his own perfume business and was asked repeatedly by Dr Tan regarding the returns on his forex trading, the Accused, in the words of the Prosecution, concocted a web of lies[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) to maintain Dr Tan’s trust. Instead of coming clean with Dr Tan, the Accused spun a story of how Dr Tan’s funds (in Sterling Pound) were locked up by Corrupt Practices Investigation Branch (CPIB) because the “_wholesaler of the forex_” was involved in counterfeit notes and CPIB investigations were on-going. Dr Tan testified that he bought the story and even went so far as to lend emotional support to the Accused[^21]. The deceit of the Accused enabled him to get even more monies from Dr Tan as they resumed trading subsequently, albeit in other currencies[^22]. I found the conduct of the Accused reprehensible.

21     In relation to the other points raised in the mitigation, I acknowledged that in this case, there was only one victim and he (Dr Tan) was not a vulnerable victim who had been targeted by the Accused. That said, the total loss which Dr Tan suffered was not a paltry sum but massive – more than $1.8 million. This was money which Dr Tan would never be able to recover.

22     The fact that the offences were not pre-meditated was neutral, not mitigating in nature. Further, whilst I was sympathetic to the personal circumstances of the Accused described by Defence Counsel[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) - that he is impecunious and staying in a rental home, facing health challenges and having to support six children - it is trite that little or no mitigating weight can be attached to them[^24]. They were not exceptional.

23     Essentially, there were no mitigating factors in favour of the Accused, other than the fact that he was a first offender. He had claimed trial to the charges and had not made any restitution at all to Dr Tan in respect of the monies entrusted to him.

#### Global Sentence

24     In seeking a global sentence of seven years and 20 months’ imprisonment, Prosecution relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tio Chee Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 112</span> (“_Tio Chee Hui_”). In this case, the offender in _Tio Chee Hui_ had agreed to sell to two moneychangers RMB three million RMB six million for S$639,473 and S$1,294,200 respectively. He requested to receive the SGD first, before making the RMB transfers into the designated Chinese bank accounts. The moneychangers agreed to this as they trusted him.[^25] The total amount misappropriated was S$1,933,673 and no restitution was made. In addition, the offender in _Tio Chee Hui_ claimed trial and only elected to plead guilty after eight prosecution witnesses had given evidence. He was sentenced to seven years and six months’ imprisonment. _Tio Chee Hui_’s appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court. Prosecution submitted that the facts were similar and that an uplift in sentence in the Accused’s case was warranted due to the lack of any plea of guilt.

25     Defence Counsel, on the other hand, distinguished _Tio Chee Hui’s_ case on the basis that in _Tio Chee Hui_, there was a scheme that was hatched from the outset. The offender in _Tio Chee Hui_ lured the victims to part with their money and immediately ran away after taking the monies[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26). The court in _Tio Chee Hui_ found clear deliberation involved in committing the offences in the consideration of the appropriate sentence. I found that to be a fair distinction between the cases.

26     However, that fact aside, the present case did bear some factual similarities with _Tio Chee Hui._ The total value of property misappropriated was S$1,861,635.98 in this case and S$1,933,673 in _Tio Chee Hui_. No restitution had been made by either offender and both had chosen to claim trial to the charges. The offender in _Tio Chee Hui_ chose to plead guilty in the course of trial whereas the Accused maintained his plea of not-guilty until he was found guilty of the offences at the conclusion of trial. I was of the view that the overall harm and culpability levels in both these cases were largely compatible.

27     Bearing in mind the value of the property misappropriated in the charges and the overall facts and circumstances of the case, I imposed the following sentences:

28     The sentences were generally consistent with the sentences in cases involving similar amounts of monies misappropriated even after taking into account the facts unique to each case. I was also satisfied that in ordering the sentences in three of the charges to run consecutively, the global sentence of six years and 20 months’ imprisonment did not offend the totality principality. It was an aggregate sentence which was just and fair, considering the totality of the circumstances of the case.

## Conclusion

29     The sentence was backdated to 21 July 2022 – the day of Accused’s conviction whereupon the Accused’s bailor had asked to be discharged. In imposing this sentence, I had also taken into account the period which the Accused spent in remand i.e. 28 January 2021 to 10 March 2021[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27).

30     The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
