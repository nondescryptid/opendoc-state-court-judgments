\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9181/2019/02.\]

30 August 2019

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       A married couple, Zariah Binte Mohd Ali (Zariah), a female Singaporean, 58 years old, and Mohammed Bin Dahlan (B2) a male Singaporean, 60 years old (both as at 2019), were alleged to have committed maid abuse against their domestic helper, a female Indonesian National (“the Victim“) over a 6-month period in 2012.

2       The Prosecution framed a total of 30 charges against Zariah, and 1 charge against Dahlan. For the trial, the Prosecution proceeded on 12 charges against Zariah, with the remaining 18 charges stood down.

3       These 12 proceeded charges against Zariah were for voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon (7 counts), voluntarily causing grievous hurt (1 count), and voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon (4 counts). Essentially:

> (a)     For the charges of voluntarily causing hurt by a dangerous weapon to her domestic helper (s 324 r/w 73(2) Penal Code), Zariah was alleged to have caused hurt to the Victim with an instrument for cutting (scissors or chopper), or an instrument which, when used as a weapon of offence (a hammer, bamboo pole or stone pounder), is likely to cause death.

> (b)     For the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to her domestic helper (s 325 r/w 73(2) Penal Code), Zariah was alleged to have forcefully pushed back the Victim‘s left little finger causing permanent impairment of the powers of the joint, characterised by a deformed finger.

> (c)     For the charges of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon (s 326 Penal Code), Zariah was alleged to have carried out acts with an instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death (the hammer, bamboo pole or stone pounder) causing the Victim to sustain grievous hurt as a result.

4       As for Dahlan, he faced a single charge of voluntarily causing hurt to his domestic helper (s 323 r/w 73(2) Penal Code) by hitting her head with the cover of a frying pan.

5       For the trial, both accused persons were represented by Mr Jayakumar Naidu and Mr Rajwin Singh Sandhu, while DPPs Ms Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz and Mr Jason Nim prosecuted. The Prosecution applied for a joinder of trial pursuant to s 145(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”), and this was consented to by the Defence.

6       At the end of the trial, after going through the Notes of Evidence (NE), the exhibits, and the submissions of parties, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to establish the respective charges against the accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted them accordingly.

7       Following their convictions, and after hearing submissions on sentence from a new set of DPPs (Ms Tan Wen Hsien and Ms Li Yihong) as well as the mitigation plea presented by a new counsel, Mr Niroze Idroos, I sentenced the accused persons as follows:

> (a)     For Zariah: A global sentence of 132 months’ (i.e. 11 years’) imprisonment and an order for her to compensate the Victim a sum of $56,497.62 (in default five months’ imprisonment); and

> (b)     For Dahlan: A sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment and an order for him to compensate the Victim in the amount of $1,000 (in default five days’ imprisonment).

8       On 3 August 2019, both accused persons filed appeals against their convictions, sentences and orders of compensation made against them. On 6 August 2019, the Prosecution filed an appeal against the sentence imposed on Zariah. On 27 August 2019, Zariah filed a Notice of Discontinuance. Thus, the only remaining appeals relate to:

> (a)     Dahlan’s appeal against his conviction, sentence of 15 month’s imprisonment and an order for compensation of $1,000; and

> (b)     The Prosecution’s appeal against the sentence of 132 months’ (i.e. 11 years’) imprisonment imposed on Zariah.

9       Thus, for the purposes of this grounds of decision, I will focus mainly on the evidence and findings that are relevant to the remaining appeals, although I will still discuss matters relating to Zariah’s conviction and compensation order, in so far as they are relevant for the remaining appeals.

## (2)   The charges against the accused persons

10     The offences by the accused persons were all alleged to have been committed between June and December 2012. In respect of Dahlan, he faced a single maid abuse charge (MCN-900929-2014) under s 323 r/w s 73(2). The elements of his charge are as follows:-

> (a)     Sometime between June and December 2012, at #XXX of Block 319, Woodlands Street 31, Singapore (“the flat”);

> (b)     Dahlan was a member of Zariah’s household, namely, Zariah’s husband, when Zariah was the employer of the Victim, a domestic maid;

> (c)     Dahlan hit the Victim on her head with a cover of a frying pan;

> (d)     With the intention of causing her hurt or with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause her hurt; and

> (e)     Thereby causing the Victim bodily pain.

11     As for Zariah, who was the employer of the Victim, she faced more serious maid abuse charges. Most of the alleged offences involved the use of instruments to inflict hurt or grievous hurt on the Victim, and they took place at the flat. Their brief details are as follows:

12     For the trial, parties agreed to undisputed matters set out in a Statement of Agreed Facts (PS1). These included the following:

> (a)     Zariah and Dahlan are husband and wife and they resided at the flat at the time of the alleged offences from June to December 2012;

> (b)     Zariah employed the Victim as a domestic maid from 30 November 2011 when parties entered into a contract of employment, until 19 December 2012 when the Victim returned to Indonesia; and

> (c)     Dahlan was a member of Zariah’s household at the time of his alleged offence.

## (3)   An outline of the Prosecution case

13     The Prosecution called 13 witnesses to testify. They consisted of the Victim, other Indonesian witnesses including witnesses that the Victim interacted with after she was sent back to Indonesia by the accused persons, three maid agents who had dealt with this case, a doctor who had examined the Victim before her employment with the accused persons, and two doctors who had examined the Victim after the offences had been reported, as well as an interpreter and various police officers involved with the case.

14     I shall set out an outline of the Prosecution’s main evidence based on its submissions, the Notes of Evidence (NE) and the exhibits tendered in the course of the trial, only in so far as they are relevant for the remaining appeals.

### (a)   Victim’s evidence of the assault

#### (i)   The Victim‘s background and employment with the accused persons

15     The Victim is a female Indonesian citizen who was 32 years of age (D.O.B.: 16 July 1980) at the time of the offences. She was from a village in Indramayu, Indonesia, and was not well-educated. She spoke only Malay and Bahasa Indonesia but not English, and did not wear a tudung when she came to Singapore in November 2011.

16     When the Victim first arrived in Singapore, she had gone to ‘United Home’ maid agency, and her agent there was PW3 Mike Seah Swee Huat (Mike Seah). This was her first visit to Singapore and her first employment was with Zariah. At home, the Victim addressed Zariah as ‘Ma’am’ and Dahlan as ‘Sir’. Zariah and Dahlan also have two children, DW3 Nur Atiqah Binte Mohamad (“Atiqah”) and DW5 Muhammad Asri Bin Mohamad (“Asri”).

17     During the period of her employment, the Victim was only allowed to call home once, before the medical check-up at the six-month mark of her employment, and this was done using Zariah’s mobile phone. Zariah was with the Victim during this telephone call. The telephone number that the Victim called was recorded in a telephone book of hers, which Zariah eventually threw away. The Victim had no mobile phone of her own. She also had no days off during her employment, and no friends in Singapore.

18     The Victim said that one of her duties was to take care of Zariah who had suffered a stroke. The stroke had affected the left side of her body but her right side remained normal. In addition, Zariah could go to work and would do so by herself in a taxi.[^1] Zariah worked during the weekdays from Monday to Friday.

#### (ii)   The period of abuse

19     The Victim‘s relationship with Zariah and the family was good in the first six months of her employment. She would receive “(o)nly normal scolding, no abuse”. [^2] This was before her medical check-up on 4 June 2012, which was at the six-month mark of her employment.

20     However, not long after the June 2012 medical check-up, and up to a week prior to the Victim‘s return to Indonesia (on 19 December 2012), i.e. for the final six months of the Victim‘s employment with Zariah, the Victim’s relationship with Zariah deteriorated, and Zariah would frequently scold the Victim and subject her to physical abuse using her right hand. The Victim said that she could not remember the exact date and month of the various incidents “because many abuses happened to me, so I can’t recall the date and the month.” She also said that the assaults sometimes happened at the daytime, and sometimes at night.[^3] In addition, to the physical abuse, Zariah would also tell the Victim that her eldest child had passed away.[^4]

#### (iii)   Evidence on the charges against Zariah and Dahlan

21     The Victim was extensively questioned by both the Prosecution and the Defence concerning the allegations set out in the charges. Her evidence, pertaining to the specific charges, is summarised below.

##### (1)    1st charge (DAC-915341-2014): 1st occasion when she was hit on her head with a hammer

22     During the period of abuse from June to December 2012, Zariah had hit the Victim‘s head with a hammer on about 5 occasions.

23     The first occasion took place after the six-month medical check-up. On this occasion, the Victim was cleaning the toilet in Zariah’s bedroom in the flat, when Zariah scolded the Victim for not being ‘clean enough’ and for working too slowly. When the Victim continued cleaning, Zariah hit her once on the back of her head “very hard” with the blunt side of a hammer.The hammer was “big” with two prongs, a blunt end, and with a wooden handle.[^5]

24     When hit, the Victim had shouted ‘ma’am, pain’, and her head began to bleed. The Victim then went to the kitchen toilet to clean the wound using water, and also used a small towel to dress the wound. Zariah also gave the Victim a sanitary pad (Softex) to stop the bleeding. However, the bleeding continued.[^6]

##### (2)    5th charge (DAC-915345-2014): Final occasion when she was hit on her head with a hammer

25     The final occasion when Zariah hit the Victim on the head with a hammer occurred under similar circumstances; when the Victim was cleaning the toilet in Zariah’s bedroom, and Zariah scolded her for not being ‘clean enough’ and for not working fast enough. Zariah had hit the Victim once on the back of her head “very hard” with the blunt side of a hammer. Upon being hit, the Victim turned and saw Zariah holding the hammer with her right hand. The Victim had shouted “ma’am, pain”, and her head began to bleed more profusely than on the first occasion as her wound from the previous attack had not healed. The Victim had gone to the kitchen toilet to clean the wound using water, and had also used a small towel to dress the wound, but this was insufficient to stop the bleeding. Zariah had thrown the Victim a sanitary pad to stop the bleeding which the Victim used to dress her wound. She could not do anything else as she said that she “don’t have any medicine and ma’am doesn’t care”.[^7]

26     Zariah had also cut the Victim‘s hair where the head injuries were. In one of the photographs (P1(8)), pink scars could be seen on her head, which the Victim said was caused by being hit on the head an estimated 5 times with a hammer by Zariah. There were also bald patches on her head where her hair was cut.[^8] As late as July 2013, the Victim‘s hair had not grown back at the injury areas (shown on PS1-E(31)). Her hair was normal before she came to Singapore. Thus, the Victim sustained permanent disfiguration on her head in the form of scarring (as shown on PS1-E(31)) which persisted to the day that she testified in court.

##### (3)    6th charge (DAC-915346-2014): 1st occasion when her mouth was hit with a hammer

27     During the period between June and December 2012, Zariah had hit the Victim‘s mouth on more than two occasions using the blunt end of a hammer. This resulted in damage being caused to her bottom and front teeth, as evidenced by the photograph (P1(10)) [^9].

28     On the first occasion, the Victim was cleaning the front of Zariah’s bedroom door when Zariah scolded her because of her work. Zariah then told her to _grin_ such that her teeth were bared. When the Victim did this, Zariah held the hammer in her right hand and used it to strike the Victim once on her mouth. The hammer hit the top row of the Victim‘s teeth and the middle of the Victim‘s bottom lip, causing her gums to bleed. Her lips also became swollen, and her teeth loosened. The Victim then went to the kitchen toilet to clean her mouth with water. Her teeth was “shaking” but she did not do anything as she had no medicine[^10].

##### (4)    7th charge (DAC-915347-2014): Final occasion when her mouth was hit with a hammer

29     On the final occasion, the Victim was cleaning the kitchen when Zariah called her over and began scolding her about her work. Zariah then proceeded to strike the Victim once on her mouth with the blunt end of the hammer that she held in her right hand. The hammer made contact with the middle of the Victim‘s bottom lip, and this was “very painful” to her. Her gums also bled, her bottom two teeth became detached, and two of the teeth in the middle on the top row were broken. The Victim said “ma’am, pain” and ran to the kitchen toilet to wash off the blood. The Victim‘s lips have since become “deformed” as a result[^11].

##### (5)    9th charge(DAC-915349-2014): 1st occasion when her left ear was hit with a bamboo pole

30     Between June and December 2012, Zariah had hit the Victim on her left ear with a bamboo pole more than twice. This bamboo pole was usually used for hanging clothes and was about one metre long[^12]. As a result, Zariah had caused damage to the Victim’s left ear (PS1-F (10))[^13].

31     On the first occasion, the Victim was cleaning Zariah’s bedroom when the latter instructed her to fetch the bamboo pole from the kitchen. When the Victim did this and handed the bamboo pole to Zariah, the latter began scolding the Victim for not being “clean enough” and not “fast enough” in her work. Zariah then suddenly hit the Victim‘s left ear once with the bamboo pole. She did this by holding the bamboo pole in her right hand and swinging it in a downward motion, and hitting the top part of the Victim‘s left ear. The Victim had shouted “pain” and her ear began to bleed. She then ran to the toilet to clean the wound with water. Her ear also became swollen[^14].

##### (6)    10th charge (DAC-915350-2014): 2nd occasion when her left ear was hit with bamboo pole

32     On the second occasion, the Victim was cleaning the kitchen when Zariah instructed her to fetch the bamboo pole, which was kept behind the door of Zariah’s bedroom. The Victim had taken the pole[^15] and handed it to Zariah. The latter then held it in her right hand and used it to hit the Victim on her ear. The bamboo pole broke upon impact. When the pole struck her, the Victim shouted “pain” and then ran to the toilet to wash with water as her ear was bleeding. Her ear became deformed after this incident[^16].

##### (7)    12th charge (DAC-915352-2014): 1st occasion when her forehead was hit with a stone pounder

33     Between June and December 2012, Zariah had hit the Victim on her forehead (from the left, to the middle, and to the right[^17]) using a stone pounder more than five times. This resulted in damage being caused to her forehead [^18].

34     On the first occasion, the Victim was cleaning in front of Zariah’s bedroom door in the flat when Zariah called her over and began scolding her for not working “fast enough” and for not being “clean enough”. Zariah then held on to the stone pounder with her right hand and used it to strike the Victim‘s forehead once “very hard” in a downward motion. The Victim had shouted “ma’am, pain” and had gone to the toilet to rub her forehead to alleviate the pain. Her skin on her forehead turned dark and there was also swelling[^19].

##### (8)    16th charge (DAC-915356-2014): Final occasion when her forehead was hit with a stone pounder

35     On the final occasion, the Victim was likewise cleaning in front of Zariah’s bedroom door when Zariah scolded her and then hit her forehead once using the stone pounder held in her right hand. The Victim had said “ma’am, pain”. She then went to the toilet to rub her forehead to alleviate the pain. Her forehead became deformed after this incident[^20].

##### (9)    17th charge (DAC-915357-2014): 1st occasion when she was stabbed with a pair of scissors on her shoulders

36     On more than five occasions between June and December 2012, Zariah stabbed the Victim in her shoulder region, multiple times in a downward thrusting motion, using a pair of scissors. The attacks were on both the left and right shoulders. The Victim‘s shoulders became scarred as a result.[^21] The pair of scissors that was used had a black plastic handle, measured about 15cm-long and had a sharp end (see P4 for a drawing of the scissors).

37     The first such attack took place when the Victim was cleaning in Zariah’s bedroom toilet. Zariah had instructed the Victim to fetch the pair of scissors, which Zariah then used to stab the back of the Victim’s shoulders. The Victim‘s shoulder region bled as a result, and it was very painful. The Victim ran to the toilet and used water to clean up. However, she did not have any medication, nor was she given any by Zariah [^22].

##### (10)    21st charge (DAC-915361-2014): Final occasion when she was stabbed with a pair of scissors on her shoulders

38     The final occasion took place in Zariah’s bedroom toilet when the Victim was cleaning. Again Zariah instructed the Victim to fetch her the scissors. Zariah continued scolding her and then stabbed the back of her shoulder multiple times. The Victim‘s back bled and it was even more painful than the first occasion as there were pre-existing injuries on her back. The Victim then ran to the toilet because it was bleeding. There, she used water to clean up but she did not have any medication.[^23].

39     Zariah’s stabbing of the Victim with the pair of scissors caused holes to appear in the Victim‘s T-shirt. Dahlan saw these holes and asked the Victim “why like that?”. The Victim replied that Zariah had done this. However, Dahlan showed no reaction on hearing this.

40     Her stabbing by Zariah also resulted in scarring to both sides of the back of the Victim‘s shoulder as seen from photograph P1(e).It also took several months for the injuries to heal[^24].

##### (11)    24th charge (DAC-915364-2014): When her left forearm was slashed with a chopper

41     For this offence, the Victim was cleaning fish in the kitchen, and standing on the right of the sink (see PS1-D(12)), while Zariah was standing on the Victim‘s left. Zariah had scolded the Victim saying that she was slow and it was not clean. Suddenly, Zariah held a chopper (see drawing of chopper at P5) in her right hand, and slashed the Victim‘s left forearm in a downward slashing and chopping motion. As a result, the Victim‘s arm began bleeding “quite a lot”, and it was “very painful” The Victim said “ma’am painful” and then went to the toilet to clean up the blood. The Victim‘s flash was exposed as a result of the cut. Zariah had given her a plaster to put on the wound, but it continued bleeding. The Victim then covered the wound using \`plastic’ and scotch tape. There was persistent swelling and bleeding, and the injury took a long time to heal.[^25]

##### (12)    27th charge (DAC-915367-2014): Victim‘s left finger was forcefully pushed back causing permanent impairment of the joint and a deformed finger

42     For this final charge, the Victim stated that Zariah had used her right hand to pull the Victim‘s little finger on the latter’s left hand. This had taken place at the kitchen when the Victim was cleaning the fish, and also in Zariah’s room on the table and at the doorway. Zariah had used a piece of tissue and pulled the Victim‘s left little finger “quite far” back until a “tuk” sound was heard. This was “very painful”. After that, the Victim could no longer straighten her finger, even though her finger was previously normal. The Victim could not do anything to treat her finger and could only hold it with a piece of tissue. [^26]

##### (13)    Evidence on the charge against Dahlan

43     As for the charge against Dahlan, sometime between the six-month medical check-up in June 2012 and her return to Indonesia on 19 December 2012, Dahlan had hit the Victim in the kitchen once with a grey pan cover (P6)[^27] “very hard” on the top of her head in the kitchen. This had taken place after Dahlan had scolded the Victim for not working fast enough. As a result, it was “very painful”, and the Victim had a headache afterwards.[^28]

#### (iv)   Concealment of abuse and having no means to escape or recourse to help

44     During the period of abuse, the family took steps to conceal signs of the abuse and to deprive the Victim of the means to escape or to seek help.

> (a)     When the Victim went grocery shopping with Atiqah, she would be instructed by Zariah and Atiqah to wear a long-sleeved sweater to conceal the injuries on her arms. She was also told by Zariah to wear the tudung to conceal the injuries on her head. In addition, the Victim said that while she did think of running away when she went out with Atiqah, she did not do so because Zariah had threatened her, and because she did not know where to go as Singapore was very different from her village in Indonesia, and she did not have friends here. Moreover, she was new to Singapore and did not know how to seek help or to make a police report.[^29]

> (b)     When the Victim was at home in the flat, the doors and windows would be locked, and only Zariah, Dahlan and the children had the keys. The Victim also did not know where the spare keys were kept.[^30]Even when the windows were left open, such as when Zariah was home, the Victim did not shout for help because she thought that she would be abused further. [^31] As for her neighbours, the Victim said that she does not speak to them, and that Zariah had threatened her not to speak to anyone.

> (c)     Zariah had also told the Victim that the house telephone was ‘locked’ and that outgoing calls could not be made. In addition, the Victim‘s diary, which had telephone numbers and information from MOM as to whom she could call when she was in distress, was disposed of by Zariah once the abuse began.

> (d)     When there were visitors to the house, Zariah would instruct the Victim to stay in the kitchen toilet until the visitors had left. The Victim did not shout for help because Zariah threatened her not to exit the toilet.

45     Finally, the Victim did not retaliate or defend herself from the attacks because she feared that Zariah would report her to the Police, and that this would create problems and prevent her from earning a living to support her family.

### (b)   Other evidence indicative of the assault

#### (i)   Victim was abruptly sent back to Indonesia and her injuries were concealed

46     As set out in PS1 (Statement of Agreed Facts) at \[8\], the Victim was due for her next medical check-up in December 2012. However, before this could be carried out, she was suddenly sent back to Indonesia on 19 December 2012 (PS1 at \[7\]). Zariah only informed the Victim of her impending return on the night before 19 December 2012.

47     Prior to this, the Victim had frequently requested to return home because of Zariah’s lie to her that the Victim‘s eldest child had passed away. When she did this, Zariah replied that she could not afford to do so because Dahlan had no money for this. The Prosecution argued that her sudden sending back to Indonesia was apparently motivated by the accused persons’ fear that the abuse would be detected at the medical check-up in December 2012.

48     At the time of her return to Indonesia, the Victim had bruises on her face (below her eyes, lips, forehead, nose-bridge, and ears) and injuries on her head. Before her departure, Zariah had given the Victim a long-sleeved shirt, trousers and a tudung to wear on the date of her return. Atiqah also gave the Victim a pair of prescriptive glasses (P7) to wear and put make-up on the Victim.

49     In addition, Zariah gave the Victim 400,000 Indonesian Rupiah (“IDR”) for transport. On that date, Dahlan, Zariah and Atiqah had taken the taxi with the Victim to the airport, where Zariah apparently arranged for group photographs to be taken. The Victim said that she did not seek help from the immigration officer at Changi Airport because she was very happy to be going home to meet her family, and as she “…had left the devil’s house”.[^32]

#### (ii)   Discovery of the Victim‘s injuries and corroborative evidence from Marpuah

50     The Victim arrived at Bandung, Indonesia, at about 3 p.m. She then took the bus to her mother’s house with her husband. The entire journey back home from the Indonesian airport took about 8 hours and she reached home at about 11 pm. During the journey, the Victim asked about their children. Her husband did not notice the injuries because she did not tell him about the abuse. Instead, she was focused on returning home to see her children.

51     The Victim subsequently arrived at her mother’s (PW7 Marpuah’s) house in the village at about 11 p.m. There was a blackout then. As it was late, and as she was tired, the Victim did not immediately tell her family about the abuse. Further, as requested by Zariah, the Victim sent Zariah an SMS message to inform Zariah of her arrival in Indonesia.

52     While the Victim was sleeping, her tudung fell off and Marpuah noticed her injuries. She then related the abuse to Marpuah who promptly told the Victim‘s husband. He, in turn, informed the Victim‘s agent in Indonesia. [^33]

53     The Victim then sought medical attention from a village doctor. She had to borrow 200,000 IDR to pay for this. In order to repay these loans, and to pay for her medical treatment, the Victim sent text messages to Zariah on 21 December 2012 at 8.45 am (see P9, serial number 96), and requested money from Zariah to pay for the cost of the treatment. Zariah gave her $1 million rupiah for this purpose by transferring the money into the Victim‘s husband’s account[^34].

54     Aside from the Victim, Marupah also testified about the discovery of the Victim’s injuries. Her testimony was broadly consistent with the Victim‘s account. Essentially:[^35]

> (a)     Marupah said that the Victim returned home with her husband late at night, and was wearing a tudung and glasses. Marpuah subsequently noticed some of the Victim‘s injuries (missing teeth, deformed left ear, bruised forehead) and asked the Victim about them. The Victim said that they were caused by her female employer.

> (b)     The next morning, Marpuah had to assist the Victim to shower due to her injuries. She then noticed more injuries on the Victim, including those on the top of head, her shoulders, and her forehead, and cuts on the Victim‘s arm, as well as the Victim being unable to bend her fingers. What she saw correlated to what was shown on the photographs of the Victim marked P19 (3, 4, 6, 7 and 8) which were subsequently taken by PW8 Hendra Sumis Yuyun (Yoan), her Indonesian maid agent, on 3 January 2013. Further, the deformity on the Victim’s ear correlated to P1(12), a photograph of the Victim taken by Mike Seah on 7 January 2013. The Victim did not have these injuries before leaving to work in Singapore.

#### (iii)   Record of Victim‘s injuries and corroboration by further witnesses

55     The Victim first received treatment from a village doctor, before being brought to Karang Tengag Medik Hospital in Jakarta on 3 January 2013 by her husband and Yoan. She was warded for 15 days. During this period, Mike Seah visited her and she provided the information in P10, which was a note setting out the chronology of events and an account of her injuries.[^36] P10 was signed by the Victim and the Victim‘s husband. According to Yoan[^37], P10 was prepared by her based on the Victim‘s reporting. However, the Victim was unable to read P10. Neither was P10 read back to the Victim.

56     Mike Seah also testified that he had visited the Victim on 7 January 2013, and witnessed the Victim‘s injuries which were rather severe. The Victim had told Mike that the perpetrators were the ‘wife’, the ‘husband’ and the ‘daughter’, but that the main perpetrator was the wife. Mike took photographs of the Victim‘s injuries. Mike confirmed that he received P10 from Yoan, and that he eventually gave this to PW6 Yuwono Sukmo (Sukmo), a counsellor from the Indonesian embassy.

57     A first information report was eventually lodged by Sukmo with the police on 11 April 2013 (P11). This was done by Sukmo who was not proficient in English and who had not met the Victim before P11 was lodged. The report was made by Sukmo who was then in a rush. The Victim subsequently returned to Singapore on 27 April 2013 to assist in the Police investigations.

### (c)   Medical and photographic evidence of the Victim’s condition

58     It was not disputed that the Victim had no physical deformities or abnormalities when she first arrived in Singapore on 21 November 2011. In this regard, on 22 November 2011, PW4 Dr Chua Thiam Eng (“Dr Chua”) from Cambridge Clinic had performed a pre-employment medical examination on the Victim, and had come up with the \`Full Medical Examination Form for Foreign Workers’ dated 23 November 2011 (PS1A). At that time, Dr Chua had found no significant physical abnormalities or deformities which would have affected the Victim‘s fitness to work.[^38]

59     However, photographs that were taken after the Victim was sent back to Indonesia by the accused persons showed her change in condition at that time. Such photographic evidence consisted of:

> (a)     P1 (photographs of the Victim‘s injuries taken by Mike Seah using his mobile phone when he visited the Victim in Indonesia on 7 January 2013)[^39].

> (b)     P19 (photographs of the Victim‘s injuries taken by Yoan at the hospital at Jakarta on 3 January 2013)[^40].

> (c)     PS1-E (photographs of the Victim‘s injuries taken on 3 July 2013 in Singapore).

> (d)     PS1-F (photographs of the Victim‘s injuries taken on 18 July 2013 in Singapore).

60     The Victim was also examined by PW5 Dr Mohammad Usman Butt (Dr Butt) in Singapore on 27 April 2013, when he was working at the accident and emergency department at Alexandra Hospital. His focus then was to look out for “acute, life-threatening injuries which required immediate medical attention”. Where he observed injuries that were not such injuries, he gave a rough description of them.[^41] Amongst other things, Dr Butt noted that for the Victim, she had a head injury and a left ear deformity, and multiple scars on her shoulder, left and right forearms, left and right hands, left and right knees. She also had two missing lower front teeth and two chipped upper front teeth.[^42]

61     In addition, the Prosecution called a medical expert, PW10 Dr George Paul (“Dr Paul”), a Senior Consultant Forensic Pathologist with the Health Sciences Authority, who is a specialist trained in forensic medicine. He had examined the Victim on 3 July 2013 and had prepared a comprehensive medical report dated 4 March 2014 (P20). Dr Paul also testified in court. Dr Paul’s evidence was comprehensively summarised by the Prosecution at “Table B: Dr George Paul’s Evidence” in the Prosecution’s Submissions.[^43]. Some of the pertinent observations made by Dr Paul included the following[^44]:

> (a)     The injuries he observed on the Victim were consistent with the Victim‘s allegations of abuse perpetrated by Zariah.

> (b)     In particular, the scarring on the Victim was consistent with a pattern of systematic and repeated abuse where injuries were inflicted, and re-inflicted in the presence of pre-existing injuries.

> (c)     As regards the charges for causing grievous hurt, Dr Paul confirmed that the injuries that were identified are permanent in nature, and amount to grievous hurt within the meaning of the Penal Code.

> (d)     Based on P1 and P19, which are the photographs of the Victim‘s injuries taken on 3 and 7 January 2013 respectively in Indonesia, Dr Paul opined that these injuries were inflicted during the period of abuse from June to December 2012.

> (e)     Further, based on the position of some of the injuries found on the top of the Victim’s head, back of the shoulder region, and the nature and severity of such injuries, Dr Paul was of the view that it is highly unlikely that they were self-inflicted.

### (d)   Dahlan’s attempts at settlement

62     Evidence was also led concerning admissions by Dahlan that Zariah had caused the injuries to the Victim, and his attempt at attempting to secure a private settlement of the matter. In this respect, aside from the testimony of Prosecution witnesses, documentary evidence and incriminating text messages found on Dahlan’s mobile phone (P8 & P9) were tendered as part of the Prosecution’s case.

63     A summary of the relevant evidence can be found at “Tab C: Chronology of Events” in the Prosecution’s Submissions.[^45]. In essence, Dahlan conceded that his expenses increased in 2012 from hiring the Victim, and he had to take loans from licenced and unlicenced moneylenders. Dahlan also repeatedly stated that Zariah was the person who had caused the Victim‘s injuries. In addition, he offered to compensate the Victim for her injuries. I shall discuss these evidence in greater detail at a later part of my judgment.

## (4)   An outline of the Defence’s case

64     The case for the Defence was set out in the “Defence Closing Submissions”. The Defence also called a number of witnesses to testify. They included Dahlan, but not Zariah. In this regard, despite being given the standard allocution, Zariah chose to remain silent.

65     Aside from Dahlan (DW1), the other 4 defence witnesses were:

> (a)     DW2 Jamilah Bte Md Ali (“Jamilah”) who is Zariah’s sister;

> (b)     DW3 Nur Atiqah Bte Mohamad (“Atiqah”) who is the accused persons’ daughter;

> (c)     DW4 Dr Kong Keng He (“Dr Kong”) who is a doctor who had treated Zariah after her stroke; and

> (d)     DW5 Muhd Asri Bin Mohamad (“Asri”) who is the accused persons’ son.

66     In so far as is relevant for Dahlan’s charge, the Defence took the position that the Victim had lied when she alleged that the accused persons had caused her injuries, and that the injuries were actually caused when the Victim was not in their care.

67     The Defence also took issue with various aspects of the Prosecution’s case, arguing that there were contradictions in the Victim’s evidence, and that her claims were indicative of her “playing the role of the victim“. Amongst other things, the Defence highlighted that:

> (a)     It was incredible that the Victim’s claim was that her injuries had occurred only six months after her employment with the accused persons. This was apparently tailored to fit in with the fact that her medical in June 2012 showed that no injuries were found; and

> (b)     It was incredible that the Victim had not sought help during the abuse.

68     In addition, the Defence argued that there was evidence presented that rebutted the Victim‘s claim that she had been assaulted:

> (a)     Photograph D5 showed that she was without any injuries on 14 July 2012;

> (b)     Photograph D6 showed that around December 2012, she was “unscathed”;

> (c)     Jamilah had also testified that when she met and spoke to the Victim, she did not notice any injuries on the Victim;

> (d)     It was Zariah who had suggested taking photographs of the Victim at the airport before she left for Indonesia. However, these “photographs have been lost”[^46]; and

> (e)     On the day of her arrival back in Indonesia, it was also not possible for the Victim‘s husband not to have noticed anything wrong with her for the 8 hours that he was travelling with her from Jakarta Airport to Bandung (when she was wearing a tudung, a long-sleeved shirt, long pants and glasses), or for the Victim‘s mother, husband or children not to have enquired about her missing teeth and about her wearing glasses when she returned home.

69     As regards Dahlan’s behaviour after the Victim had made her claims of assault, Dahlan’s explanation for his actions was that he had been threatened by Edward and Mike Seah, and both of them had falsely accused his family of abusing the Victim. In addition, Edward had allegedly threatened to harm Zariah, Atiqah and Asri, and sought to extort monies from him under the guise of seeking compensation for the Victim.

## (5)   The Court’s findings

70     Having carefully assessed the testimonies of witnesses and the evidence put forward during the trial, as well as the submissions of both parties, I am of the view the Prosecution has proven its case against both Zariah and Dahlan beyond a reasonable doubt. As far as is relevant for the remaining appeals, the reasons for my decision are set out below:

### (a)   The Victim‘s account was compelling

71     The main evidence of the offences, committed against her by both Zariah and Dahlan, came from the Victim.

72     In court, over the course of 5 days of testimony, including 3 days where she was subjected to rigorous and intense course-examination by counsel, the Victim was brought through the details of her allegations, as well as a host of exhibits including photographs of the injuries on her body and various documentary exhibits and phone records.

73     While clearly distressed and distraught while narrating the details of the assaults, and when she had to answer numerous questions directed at her, sometimes in a less than friendly manner, the Victim nonetheless gave a clear and credible account of the incidents whereby Zariah and Dahlan had assaulted her. Having observed her demeanour and the manner in which she responded to questions, as well as having considered the responses that she gave, I was of the view that the Victim was coherent and convincing. Amongst other things, she was able to describe the events leading up to the assaults, the manner in which she was assaulted including the weapons that were used against her, and the hurt and injuries that were caused to her (see \[21\] – \[43\] above) .

74     In addition, I found nothing to suggest she had fabricated or exaggerated her account, or that she was untruthful, or as the Defence Counsel had put it, that she had “tailored” her evidence. In addition, the Victim had:

> (a)     Specifically, denied that her injuries had been caused by her husband, even remarking that: “I’m hurt by them. Now they are blaming my husband, I feel more hurt”; [^47]

> (b)     Become angry and denied counsel’s suggestion that her injuries were self-inflicted[^48]; and

> (c)     Maintained that she had told the truth about how she sustained the injuries on her body, and stated that she had no reason to lie about what Zariah and Dahlan had done to her[^49].

75     Indeed, I accepted that here was no advantage or motivation for the Victim to have lied about the allegations concerning Zariah or Dahlan, and to have put herself through questioning from both the police (during investigations), and from parties in court (during the hearing), if the offences had not actually been committed against her. In this regard, I would add that it was common ground, and the evidence also clearly showed, that Zariah and Dahlan are not persons of means for whom it was even remotely conceivable that the Victim (and the other witnesses) would come together and cook up such an elaborate ploy in order to blackmail or \`extort’ money from.

76     I would also add that in the case of Dahlan, the Victim had pointed to a single and very specific episode where Dahlan had hit the Victim on her head with a cover of a frying pan, causing her to suffer pain and a subsequent headache afterwards. This assault by Dahlan was very different from the other episodes of assault by Zariah on her, albeit not as serious. As such, it was not likely that the Victim would have wrongly attributable or erroneously blamed Dahlan for this particular assault, if it had not occurred.

77     While the Defence Counsel had argued that there were discrepancies in the Victim’s evidence, having carefully considered the evidence and the submissions, I was of the respectful view that as regards the matters pointed out by the Defence, if at all they amounted to discrepancies, they were minor in nature and/or were not on material matters, and could also easily be explained by the lapse of time between the period of offence (2012) and the period of her testimony (2016). In this respect, I am reminded of the words of See Kee Oon J in _Ang Lilian (Hong Lilian) vs Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 119</span>, which was another maid abuse case where the accused also faced multiple charges of causing hurt. At \[29\], on the issue of discrepancies in the victim’s evidence, his Honour had this to say:

> “It must be borne in mind that when a witness gives evidence on matters after a significant lapse of time, “adequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection” (see _Public Prosecutor v Singh Kalpanath_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 158</span> at \[54\] and \[60\]). In my view, such an allowance was appropriate in the present case as the alleged abuse occurred some two years before the commencement of the trial and it was reasonable that the victim’s memories of the abuse may have faded over the passage of time. Furthermore, the evidence showed that the victim had been frequently abused by the appellant on numerous occasions (including the specific incidents which were the subject of the charges) between January 2013 and May 2013.”

78     In the present case, where there was about a four-year lapse between the commission of the offences, and the Victim’s testimony in court, and where Zariah faced even more charges of maid abuse in total than the offender in _Ang Lilian (Hong Lilian,)_ and where there were actually two perpetrators (i.e. Zariah and Dahlan) who allegedly committed the offences over the same period, I was of the respectful view that the purported discrepancies in the Victim’s evidence did not affect the charges, especially not in light of the corroborative evidence (discussed below).

79     In addition, while the Defence had suggested otherwise, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Victim‘s circumstances at the material time: (1) being from an Indonesian village who was unfamiliar with the environment and people in Singapore; (2) being someone with no prior employment or friends here and who was also not able to speak English; and (3) also being without a mobile phone of her own and who was essentially kept in the Accused persons’ house, were all factors that pointed to her being in a vulnerable condition, with no one to turn to, and no means of escape.

80     Indeed, the difficulties faced by the Victim in the present case, mirrored the circumstances described by the Court of Appeal in _ADF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span>. At \[61\], the Court had stated:

> “…\[m\]any domestic maids work within the confines of the employer's home and have little contact with the rest of the society. Often, they are not well educated and cannot speak English or effectively communicate with the wider public. Further, not all cases of abuse come to light as some maids may be apprehensive about the consequences of seeking help in a foreign environment. Less educated maids may also not be aware of their rights and the severe view taken by the authorities here in relation to substantiated complaints….”

81     I thus did not find it surprising that the Victim could be, and was, continuously abused for a prolonged period by both accused persons in their house, and that this abuse could be carried out without the Victim seeking help from others, or without her fighting back.

82     Furthermore, I also considered as relevant the timing of the abrupt sending back of the Victim to Indonesia by the accused persons. In this regard, while the Victim had hitherto made frequent requests to be allowed to return home because of Zariah’s lie to her that her eldest child had passed away, Zariah would reply that she could not afford to do so because Dahlan had no money for this. Yet, just before the Victim was due for a medical examination in December 2012, when presumably her injuries and her wretched condition would have been discovered by the doctor, the accused persons unexpectedly decided to send her back to Indonesia. So surprising, sudden and secretive was this decision, that the Victim was only told of her impending return to Indonesia just the night before it actually took place.

83     Finally, I noted that to conceal the various injuries of the Victim, Zariah had provided her with a long-sleeved shirt, trousers and a tudung to wear on the day of return. Zariah’s daughter had even given the Victim a pair of prescriptive glasses to wear and put make-up on the Victim for this purpose.

84     It would appear that such efforts on the part of Zariah, as well as from the members of her family, were consistent with the earlier efforts that they had made to conceal the Victim‘s injuries when she was in Singapore, as well as the efforts they took to prevent her from escaping or from reaching out for help (see \[44\] – \[48\] above).

### (b)   Other strong corroborative evidence of the Victim‘s abuse by the accused persons

85     In addition, I noted that the Victim‘s convincing account was also corroborated, time and again, by what other witnesses had said, as well as the other evidence that were produced in the trial. For example, the Victim‘s account on the material aspects of how, where and who assaulted her, were corroborated by the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses who interacted with the Victim soon after she was abruptly sent back to Indonesia. Such evidence included that of Marupah (the Victim’s mother), the evidence of the Indonesian maid agent, Yoan, and that of the Singaporean agent, Mike Seah, who visited the Victim in Indonesia.

86     I also noted that some of these witnesses also assisted in recording the Victim‘s injuries in some form or another, including in the form of a note, and also took photographs of the horrific and sometimes still raw injuries on the Victim. When compared with a photograph of how the Victim looked just before she came to Singapore to work for the accused persons, the photographs of how she looked soon after she was sent away from Singapore by them – with the various marks and injuries on her body - made for a stark and glaring contrast. These documents thus provided strong supporting evidence of the ill-treatment that the Victim had suffered at the hands of the accused persons (see \[52\] – \[55\], and \[59\] above).

87     In addition, the various medical reports tendered of the Victim‘s condition, which set out the nature and extent of the Victim‘s injuries, were also strongly corroborative of the Victim‘s account as to how her injuries were caused by the accused persons. In particular, the evidence from Dr Paul (see \[61\]) showed, _inter alia_, that:

> (a)     The Victim’s injuries were consistent with her allegations of abuse, and that they were also unlikely to have been self-inflicted; and

> (b)     These injuries were inflicted during the alleged period of abuse, since Dr Paul’s view was that the injuries were _at least_ one to two months’ old as at early-January 2013.

88     In short, the medical evidence - broadly of the possible cause of the injuries, and the probable age of the injuries – provided yet more compelling support for the Victim‘s claim that they were caused by the accused persons in the manner alleged, and when the Victim was still in the accused person’s employment or, in the words of Counsel, when she was under “B1 or B2’s care”.

### (c)   Incriminating evidence from Dahlan’s actions and mobile phone entries

89     When confronted with the evidence of her injuries, Dahlan’s actions and admissions – captured not only in what he said to the witnesses, but also in entries in his mobile phone - were damning evidence. I summarise some aspects of the evidence (with which I agree) that were set out in the Prosecution’s submissions.

> (a)     First, as could be seen form the phone entries, soon after the Victim returned home and sent text messages to the accused persons from 21-24 December 2012 requesting money for medical treatment, they remitted 1 million IDR to the Victim on 24 December 2012 purportedly out of ‘goodwill’. Yet the accused persons were in financial difficulty at that time. Despite this, not only did they send the money, but they also showed a lack of curiosity to ask Victim‘s specific details about the nature or cause of her medical condition, or why she was asking for money from them for her medical treatment.

> (b)     Second, in late December 2012, after Edward, who was from the Victim‘s maid agency was informed by his Indonesian counterpart of the Victim‘s abuse suffered at the hands of Zariah, he had called Dahlan to confront him and to set up a meeting. Dahlan did not deny the allegation and agreed to meet up. After receiving messages from Edward pressuring Dahlan to meet up and to account for the matter, a message was sent on 28 December 2012, ostensibly in the name of Atiqah, requesting for a peaceful settlement of the matter.

> (c)     On 16 January 2013, Edward and Mike Seah met Dahlan, who told them that Zariah was responsible for the abuse leading to the injuries seen on the photographs of the Victim taken by Mike Seah in Indonesia, Dahlan also agreed to compensate the Victim so as to settle the matter privately without escalation of the matter to the authorities. They arrived at an agreed figure of $15,580 as compensation. Dahlan requested for time to raise the money.

> (d)     Subsequently, despite apparently being in financial difficulties, and despite having already hired a lawyer to to send a letter dated 22 January 2013 to the maid agency denying the abuse, Dahlan still met up with Edward and Mike Seah on 1 February 2013. Dahlan then voluntarily handed over $2,000 in cash to Mike Seah as compensation for the Victim. Dahlan also provided his NRIC to be photocopied and annexed to a note stating that he would have one more month’s grace period to raise the remaining sum.

> (e)     Dahlan sent a message sometime in 2013 by phone (message #13) to the Victim‘s sister’s phone requesting the Victim for a peaceful settlement of the matter.

90     While Dahlan subsequently claimed that he was threatened by Edward and Mike Seah, both of whom had allegedly falsely accused his family of abusing the Victim, and had also allegedly sought to extort monies from him under the guise of seeking compensation for the Victim, I note the Prosecution’s argument that these allegations were never put to Edward or Mike Seah.

91     Further, Dahlan did not make any police report about any alleged extortion claim or threat made to him and his family even though, as the Prosecution correctly pointed out, Dahlan had shown himself to have had no difficulty lodging Police reports previously, as could be seen from the three earlier reports that he had lodged in connection with other problems that he had faced with his previous maids from 2010 to 2011 (P29-1 to P29-3).

92     Thus, in my view, if indeed there had been such threats made to Dahlan, it is doubtful that he would not have sought police help when he was already receiving legal advice and given that he had a history of making police complaints, but that he would simply pay $2,000 to Mike Seah. That Dahlan had made the compensation payment despite being in dire financial straits at that time, and despite having to borrow money to do so, was telling indeed.

93     Further, the money – as evidenced by a receipt (P16) - was actually handed over to the Indonesian agent to be given to the Victim. Neither Mike Seah nor Edward benefitted from the compensation payment. Thus, to suggest that they (Mike and/or Edward) would break the law to “extort” money from Dahlan, and to do it for no personal gain but also at great legal risk to themselves, was simply absurd. It was also an allegation that flies in the face of evidence and of simple common sense.

94     In short, I agreed with the Prosecution that Dahlan’s actions and admissions were damning evidence, and further corroborated the claims made by the Victim that she had been assaulted as alleged in the charges.

### (d)   Other aspects of the Defence that were not credible

95     For completeness, I would add that I agreed with the Prosecution that there were numerous other aspects of the Defence’s case that were not credible.

96     First, as regards the photographs of the Victim (D5 and D6) that were allegedly taken during the period of the abuse from June to December 2012, which showed the Victim to be without any injuries, it was clear that these photographs were taken much earlier, before the period of abuse by the accused persons. In this respect, I noted that the file properties of D5 (1-4) showed that they were taken on 26 December 2011 (see D5M(124)), and that of D6 showed that D6 was taken on 1 December 2011 (see: D6M(1-5)). In fact, that these photographs showed the Victim apparently in much happier conditions, certainly accorded with the Victim’s evidence that prior to the period of offence (June to December 2012), she was still being treated well by the family, including by the accused persons.

97     As for the claim by the Defence that photographs were taken of the Victim at the airport before her departure from Singapore, which allegedly showed that she was unscathed and well, such a claim was clearly unbelievable especially when no effort was made to produce this important exculpatory evidence to the Police even when Dahlan lodged a Police report as early on as 15 May 2013 (P30). Further, I was of the view that the manner in which the Defence then tried to account for how these photographs became “lost”, allegedly because the camera that was used to take these photographs was later discovered to have been damaged, was simply too convenient and fanciful an explanation.

98     In short, the claims by the Defence were completely unbelievable, and did nothing to cast any doubt as to guilt of the accused persons, especially in light of the compelling case made against them.

## (6)   The finding of guilt

99     As there was overwhelming evidence against both Zariah and Dahlan on the charges that were proceeded with, I was of the view that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against both accused persons, and I convicted them accordingly. As stated above, only Dahlan has decided to continue with his appeal against his conviction.

## (7)   Preliminary matters prior to sentencing

100    After the conviction of the accused persons, both of them discharged their previous counsel and Mr Niroze was engaged to represent them instead.

101    Pursuant to claims made by the Defence, a considerable amount of time was then spent on determining whether Zariah was fit to plea, as well as her mental state. For the purpose of the remaining appeals, it is sufficient for me to say that at the urging of parties[^50], and after carrying out an investigation into the matter pursuant to section 247(1) of the CPC, Zariah was remanded at IMH for a proper assessment to be carried out as to her fitness to plead.[^51] Following this, Dr Cheow Enquan, consultant at IMH, who was the designated medical practitioner under section 247(3) CPC, put up a report dated 13 June 2019 in which he set out his findings. These essentially were that:

> (a)     Zariah does not suffer from any mental disorder;

> (b)     She was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence;

> (c)     She is fit to plead; and

> (d)     If incarcerated, her mental state should be monitored by the prison psychiatrist as it is possible that may become clinically depressed in future.

102    Pursuant to documents tendered by both the Defence and the Prosecution, a Newton Hearing was then fixed to:

> (a)     Determine the mental and psychiatric condition of Zariah; and

> (b)     For the Defence to dispute various medical reports that had been put up by the Prosecution for the purpose of obtaining compensation for the Victim. These reports had set out cost estimates for restorative procedures in order to reinstate the Victim to a pre-abuse condition, such as corrective surgery for her cauliflower ear, and dentures for her missing front teeth.

103    However, before the Newton Hearing could take place:

> (a)     On 24 June 2019, Mr Niroze indicated that the Defence would no longer be calling witnesses to challenge the medical reports which the Prosecution was tendering for compensation; and

> (b)     On 25 July 2019, Mr Niroze informed the court that he had been instructed to request for the Newton hearing on 29 July 2019 to be vacated and for the matter to be fixed for mitigation and sentencing instead.

104    It was thus clear that:

> (a)     The Defence had essentially accepted, or at least, not challenged the opinions and conclusions set out in Dr Cheow’s report, despite initially seeking a Newton Hearing earlier, and despite being aware of the contents of Dr Cheow’s report; and

> (b)     The Defence also did not challenge the medical reports that had been put up for the purposes of obtaining compensation for the Victim, which pertained to the cost estimates for restorative procedures to reinstate the Victim to her pre-abuse condition.

## (8)   Sentencing Process

105    With the above preliminaries dealt with, sentencing for both accused persons commenced on 31 July 2019. In the course of the sentencing process, pursuant to an application by the Defence, the Victim was questioned on her Victim Impact Statement that was tendered by the Prosecution (VIS). I delivered my decision on sentence and compensation on 1 August 2019.

### (a)   Prescribed punishments

106    To recap, Zariah was convicted on 12 charges. These charges, and their prescribed punishments, are as follows:

> (a)     For each charge of voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim, a domestic maid, by means of an instrument for stabbing or cutting (the scissors and chopper), or an instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death (the hammer, bamboo pole or stone pounder), which is an offence under section 324 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code (7 counts), the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 ½ years[^52], or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

> (b)     For the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the Victim,, a domestic maid, by forcefully pushing back the Victim‘s left little finger causing permanent impairment of the powers of the joint, characterised by a deformed finger, which is offence under section 325 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code (1 count), the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years[^53], and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

> (c)     For each charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by an instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death (the hammer, bamboo pole or stone pounder), causing the Victim to suffer permanent disfiguration of the head, which is an offence under section 326 of the Penal Code (4 counts), the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

107    As for, Dahlan, who is the husband of Zariah and a member of the same household, his charge under section 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code, for voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim, a domestic maid, by hitting her head with the cover of a frying pan, means that he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years[^54], or with fine which may extend to $7,500, or with both.

### (b)   Relevant antecedents and administration ban

108    Both Zariah and Dahlan have antecedents for maid abuse, for which they had served imprisonment sentences in 2001. The details of these antecedents were set out in _Dahlan and Zariah Bte Mohd Ali v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGMC 30</span>[^55], and also highlighted by the Prosecution in its submissions. In essence, for their previous maid abuse offences:

> (a)     Zariah had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 323 r/w s 73 Penal Code for rubbing chili (sambal goreng) on her maid’s eyes and throwing a mug of water at the maid (s 352 Penal Code). Zariah had also consented to two other charges under s 323 r/w s 73 being taken into consideration for sentencing. She was sentenced to 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the causing hurt offence, and fined $500 (in default 2 weeks imprisonment) for the criminal force offence.

> (b)     Dahlan had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 323 r/w s 73 Penal Code; one charge was for slapping the maid (once on the neck), and the other charge was for grabbing and pulling her ears. He was sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, and both sentences were ordered to run consecutively, for a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

109    As stated by the Prosecution, both accused persons were subsequently subjected to an administrative ban from further hiring domestic helpers. However, following their appeal, this ban was lifted in January 2010 and they were allowed to hire the Victim in 2011.

### (c)   Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and compensation

110    In the present case, the Prosecution urged me to impose:

> (a)     A sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment on Dahlan; and

> (b)     A global sentence of at least 13 years’ imprisonment on Zariah.

111    In the case of Dahlan, the submission of the Prosecution was essentially for the court to apply the sentencing framework set out in _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ (“_Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_”) <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span>. There, the High Court had propounded a four-stage test for sentencing in maid abuse cases for charges under s 323 r/w s 73(2) Penal Code. The Prosecution argued that based on the framework, the sentence for Dahlan should be at least 18 months’ imprisonment.

112    In the case of Zariah, the position of the Prosecution was to apply a sentencing framework similar to that set out in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_ with the necessary modifications made to the indicative range of sentences to take into account the fact that Zariah was convicted of much more serious offences under s 324 r/w s 73(2), s 325 r/w 73(2) and s 326 Penal Code, where the maximum prescribed imprisonment terms were 3 ½ times (10 ½ years) to 5 times (15 years) that of the maximum 3-year term that could be imposed for the s 323 r/w s 73(2) offences that were dealt with in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_.

113    After considering the applicable aggravating and mitigating factors, and after considering which sentences should run consecutively, the Prosecution arrived at a proposed sentence of at least 13 years’ imprisonment for Zariah, consisting of 3 consecutive sentences of 3 years, 5 years and 5 years imprisonment as follows:

114    As for compensation, the Prosecution highlighted the general principles relating to criminal compensation under s 359 CPC that were are set out in the Supplementary Judgment of the Court in _Tay Wee Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 114</span> (“_Tay Wee Kiat Compensation_”). In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that compensation to be ordered falls under the following heads:

> (a)     Cost of medical expenses incurred and cost of prospective medical treatment to restore the Victim;

> (b)     Pain and suffering suffered by the Victim; and

> (c)     Loss of earnings.

115    In respect of the medical expenses and prospective medical treatment, the Prosecution put forward numerous reports for a claim of $36,597.62[^56].

116    As for compensation for pain and suffering, after making reference to the “_Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases”_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) and “_Practitioner’s Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents”_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2017), and adopting a rough and ready approach” the Prosecution proposed that the Victim should receive $20,000 in compensation for her pain and suffering (comprising $19,000 from Zariah; $1,000 from Dahlan). [^57]

117    Finally, for her loss of earnings, the Prosecution highlighted that for the victim in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, who did not report any serious or permanent injury, the Court had considered that four months was a reasonable period for the Victim to recover from the abuse that she had suffered. In the present case, given the extent and the gravity of the injury suffered, the Prosecution argued that the Victim should be afforded a longer period to convalesce from the abuse that she had suffered, and submitted that she ought to be compensated for six months of her then salary – i.e. $500 x 6 = $3,000.

118    As such, the Prosecution submitted that the gross compensation amount should be $59,597.62 calculated as follows:

> (a)     Medical expenses (and for the victim prospective treatment): $36,597.62

> (b)     Pain and suffering: $20,000

> (c)     Loss of earnings: $3,000

119    To this sum, the Prosecution informed the court that as the accused persons had already compensated the Victim a sum of about $2,100, this compensation amount already paid should be subtracted from the gross sum of $59,597.62, for a resulting net compensation sum of $57,497.62[^58]. Further, as the bulk of the injuries had been caused by Zariah who had been convicted of many more charges, and as her charges were of a more serious nature, the Prosecution submitted that Zariah should pay almost the entire sum of the compensation i.e. $56,497.62, while Dahlan should pay $1,000.

### (d)   Mitigation and Defence submissions on sentence and compensation

120    In essence, the Defence highlighted that Zariah is a stroke victim, who had left her employment with the People's Association's headquarters following her conviction. She has since been confined to her home in a wheelchair. As for Dahlan, he has been unable to secure permanent employment due to the ongoing proceedings. Their son, who earns approximately $2,100 per month, is the sole breadwinner of the family.

121    Further for Dahlan, based on the sentencing table in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, counsel argued that, notwithstanding that Dahlan was convicted of having hit the Victim on the head with the cover of a frying pan thus inflicting pain, there was no injury caused nor was there objective evidence of the pain caused by his actions. Mr Niroze thus argued that the harm caused was low and his culpability was also low, and that given the indicative starting point of 3 months’ imprisonment for a first-time offender, a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for Dahlan would be proportionate due to his previous conviction for a similar offence.

122    For Zariah, counsel argued that the same sentencing table in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_ should apply to her, without any modification made for the fact that Zariah was convicted of much more serious offences under s 324 r/w s 73(2), s 325 r/w 73(2) and s 326 Penal Code, with much higher maximum prescribed imprisonment terms. Based on this argument, counsel argued that Zariah should be sentenced to 27 months’ imprisonment, consisting of 2 consecutive sentences of 9 months and 18 months’ imprisonment, with the sentences for the individual charges to be imposed as follows:

123    In addition, for Zariah, counsel again made reference to the earlier report from the Defence psychiatrist, Dr Terence Leong dated 20 January 2018, and submitted that her mental condition is a relevant sentencing factor, even if there was no substantive contributory link between the accused’s mental state and her responsibility for the index offence. He also argued that Zariah’s depression and lack of capacity decreased her culpability.

124    When questioned by the court, counsel acknowledged the more recent psychiatric report from Dr Cheow (dated 13 June 2019), which was specifically prepared to assess her mental condition and fitness to plead.[^59] As summarized above at \[101\], Dr Cheow had, after considering Dr Leong’s report and other evidence and reports, opined that Zariah did not suffer from any mental disorder, was not of unsound mind and was fit to plead.

125    Counsel also argued that a long term of incarceration would exacerbate Zariah’s condition, and challenged both the Prosecution’s claim about the psychological harm suffered by the Victim, as well as the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework.

126    As regards compensation, counsel claimed that there was no clear evidence of any damage suffered by the Victim, and that if there was damage, “it must be left for her to pursue a claim as an action for damages in the Civil Court.”[^60] Further, counsel claimed that as both Zariah and Dahlan are unemployed, and in light of the custodial sentences they would have to serve, there was no prospect of any payment being made in the foreseeable future.

## (9)   Decision on Sentence

### (a)   Sentencing approach and framework

127    It is trite that deterrence and retribution are the key sentencing considerations in sentencing for maid abuse cases. Specifically, the Court of Appeal in _ADF_ had stated at \[55\]:

> “In a case of domestic maid abuse, ordinarily, the principles of deterrence and retribution take precedence. A deterrent sentence signifies that there is a public interest to protect over and above the ordinary punishment of criminal behaviour.”

128    In their respective submissions on sentence, both the Prosecution and the Defence had referred me to the approach set out in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, although parties applied the framework differently, and hence came up with vastly different results.

129    In _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, the two accused persons, Tay and his wife, Chia, were both convicted of offences of voluntary causing hurt to their domestic worker. The charges were framed under section 323 r/w section 73(2) and carried a maximum custodial term of only 3 years’ imprisonment. In dealing with the appeal against sentence, the High Court had set out a sentencing framework at \[70\] -\[75\], which essentially involves a four step approach:

> (a)     Step 1: Determine whether the harm caused to the Victim was predominantly physical, or both physical and psychological. The Court stated at \[70\]:

>> “\[70\]  The first step is for the court to determine whether the harm caused to the Victim was predominantly physical, or both physical and psychological. For example, the offender lashes out physically on impulse on one occasion, having lost his/her temper at some misdemeanor. If this does not form part of any broader trend or history of abusive conduct, and does not involve particularly degrading or humiliating treatment, the harm would probably be predominantly physical (in addition to the distress that the Victim would invariably feel from being physically assaulted). In that case, the court should consider the degree of harm as well as other aggravating and mitigating factors (see \[73\]–\[74\] below) in determining the appropriate sentence, bearing in mind other maid abuse precedents, and that “a custodial sentence is almost invariably warranted in cases of domestic maid abuse where there has been any manner of physical abuse” (_ADF_ at \[91\])…”

> (b)     Step 2: Where the harm is both physical and psychological, the degree of harm caused is to be identified in relation to each charge. At \[71\], the Court stated:

>> “\[71\]  On the other hand, there may be an additional dimension of significant psychological harm that needs to be given due weight in sentencing, for example if the abuse is sustained, humiliating and degrading, or occurs in the context of a working relationship which is generally oppressive and exploitative. Where the harm is both physical and psychological, the second step is for the court to identify the degree of harm caused in relation to each charge. Where both physical and psychological abuse have occurred, the sentencing range at this stage should start at the level of months rather than days. The following table sets out indicative ranges corresponding to the degree of harm caused in respect of a s 323 r/w s 73 Penal Code charge:

> In evaluating the psychological harm caused, the Court further held at \[72\] that the following non-exhaustive circumstances may be considered:

>> a.       Behaviour calculated to reinforce the offender’s authority and to oppress and bully the Victim into submission;

>> b.       Humiliating or degrading treatment of the Victim; and

>> c.       When psychological harm arises from a sustained pattern of abuse.

> (c)     Step 3: The court should adjust the sentence for each charge in light of other aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

>> (i)       Typical aggravating factors include (_Tay Wee Kiat_ at \[73\]):

>>> (A)       The use of a weapon or other implement of harm or injury;

>>> (B)       Efforts to prevent the Victim from seeking or accessing help;

>>> (C)       The offender’s motive – whether it was committed out of cold-blooded malice or vengefulness or a spontaneous lapse of self-control or in the heat of an unanticipated and sudden and spontaneous struggle;

>>> (D)       Whether there was deliberation or premeditation;

>>> (E)       If the offender intended to inflict greater harm than actually resulted;

>>> (F)       Presence of past convictions for similar offences as well as similar charges being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing; and

>>> (G)       A lack of remorse, which may be shown when an offender puts the Victim through the traumatic experience of testifying at trial and casts aspersions on her character.

>> (ii)       Possible mitigating circumstances include (see \[74\]):

>>> (A)       The offender’s remorse;

>>> (B)       Cooperation with the authorities; and

>>> (C)       Where a mental illness, psychological condition or learning disability significantly contributed to the commission of the offence.

> (d)     Step 4: Having determined the sentences for each of the charges, the court then decides which sentences to run consecutively and which concurrently (see \[75\]).

### (b)   Application to the present case

##### Step 1: Determine whether the harm caused to the Victim was predominantly physical, or both physical and psychological

130    In the present case, the Victim clearly suffered horrendous physical harm, both in terms of immense and immediate physical pain, but more unfortunately, also grave and permanent injuries all over her body, including scars/keloids, a deformed left ear, and the reduced use of her left hand. The medical reports put up during the trial, the evidence of the Victim and those who had interacted with her after she was sent back to Indonesia, as well as the distressing photographs taken of her physical condition and injuries, provided stark and shocking proof of the physical pain and suffering that she had been put though.

131    Added to the physical torment, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Victim had suffered significant psychological abuse at the hands of the accused persons. Over the course of the few months that the offences were taking place in the accused persons’ home:

> (a)     The Victim lived in a climate of fear exacerbated by her being deliberately isolated and left without recourse to help, or even from any source of comfort such as contact with her family. In this respect, the Victim was not allowed to call home and could not call her family in Indonesia, nor did she have access to the emergency numbers of people in Singapore who could help her.

> (b)     In addition, the Victim was threatened against speaking to her neighbours, blocked from meeting visitors to the house, and also effectively stopped from leaving the house, thus preventing her from reaching out to those who could conceivably have discovered her predicament and shortened her period of pain.

> (c)     In the case of Zariah especially:

>> (i)       She even lied to the Victim that her eldest child had passed away. To the Victim, who was a mother far away from home in a foreign land, and who was handicapped by her language ability and without the means to confirm the truth of what was told to her, such despicable falsehoods by Zariah about the loss of her loved one, would likely have added to the Victim’s distress.

>> (ii)       Further, what was also hurtful was the fact that Zariah had, on various occasions, ordered the Victim to hand over the very weapons that she then used to strike the Victim, and to inflict the grave injuries on her.

>> (iii)       Clearly, Zariah’s behaviour was calculated to reinforce her authority and to oppress and bully the Victim into submission, as well as to humiliate and belittle her. The result of Zariah’s actions were reflected in the dread and fear that Zariah continued to evoke in the Victim after the events, as well as the embarrassment and self-doubt that she subsequently caused the Victim to experience long after the offences had been committed[^61].

##### Step 2: Where the harm is both physical and psychological, the degree of harm caused is to be identified in relation to each charge.

132    As could be seen from the above, the Victim had suffered both serious physical harm, as well as serious psychological harm.

133    In the case of Zariah, her charges were all significantly more grave than those faced by Dahlan, as well as those faced by the accused persons in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, as the maximum prescribed punishment for her offences was 10 ½ years (s 324 read with s 73(2) charges) or 15 years imprisonment (s 325 read with s 73(2), and s 326 charges) respectively, all much higher than the maximum 3-year imprisonment sentence that could have been imposed for the simple hurt charges (s 323 read with s 73(2)) that were tabled against Dahlan and the accused persons in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_.

134    I thus agreed with the Prosecution that the sentence ranges set by the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, must be adjusted accordingly so the minimum and maximum sentences within the range properly reflected the very much higher prescribed punishments that Parliament had specifically marked out for more serious offences.

135    I also agreed with the Prosecution that it would be appropriate to use a multiplier of 3½ times, in the case of the s 324 r/w s 73 charges, and a multiplier of 5 times, in cases of the s 325 r/w s 73 and s 326 charges, to the sentencing ranges set out in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, to properly reflect the fact that the maximum sentences for such offences are proportionally higher as compared to the maximum prescribed punishment for s 323 r/w s 73(2) charges. To do this would be in line with the direction of the Court of Appeal in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> at \[84\] where the Court had made clear that “…sentencing judges must take note of the maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament.”

136    Indeed, to do otherwise, and to restrict the sentencing court to the much lower sentencing range in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_ that applies for simple hurt cases only– as appeared to have been suggested by the Defence - would mean that even the most egregious maid abuse cases under 324 s 325 and s 326, would attract punishments no higher than 3 years’ imprisonment. Such a suggested approach is completely untenable, illogical and against the weight of authority. In short, I rejected it outright.

137    Moving on to the table of sentencing ranges suggested by the Prosecution, I was informed by the DPP that this was same table has been proposed to the High Court in a yet to be decided appeal of _Anita Damu @ Shazana Bte Abdullah v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ (“_Anita Damu_”) (Magistrate’s Appeals No. 9358/01-02 of 2018)[^62]. For that appeal, the Prosecution had extrapolated the sentencing framework for s 323 r/w s 73(2) offences in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_ (at \[71\]), and proposed a similar sentencing framework for offences under s 324 r/w s 73(2) using a multiplier of 3 ½ times. In extrapolating the _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_ framework, the Prosecution had also incorporated the mid-range of applicable sentences in the moderate physical harm and moderate psychological harm scenarios, and proposed a framework for s 324 r/w s 73(2) offences as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="23.64%"> <col width="25.46%"> <col width="25.48%"> <col width="25.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Less serious physical harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate physical harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>More serious physical harm</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Less serious psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">10.5 – 21 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">15.5 – 42 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">21 – 63 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">15.5. – 42 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">25.5 – 63 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">45.5 – 84 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>More serious psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">21 – 63 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">45.5 – 84 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">70 – 105 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

138    In the present case, the Prosecution urged me not only to adopt the same proposed framework for s 324 r/w s 73(2) offences, but to apply a similar approach, using a multiplier of 5, to come up with the following framework for s 325 r/w s 73(2) and s 326 offences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="23.06%"> <col width="22.88%"> <col width="24.72%"> <col width="29.34%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Less serious physical harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate physical harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>More serious physical harm</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Less serious psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 –30 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22.5 – 60 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30 – 90 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22.5 – 60 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">41.25 – 90 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60 – 120 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>More serious psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30 – 90 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60-120 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">90 – 150 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

139    I considered the Prosecution’s submissions carefully. However, as it was not clear if the proposed sentencing framework for s 324 r/w s 73(2) offences, which incorporated sentence ranges for the moderate physical harm and moderate psychological harm scenarios, would be accepted by the High Court for the _Anita Damu_ appeal, and if so, whether it would be accepted as proposed, or accepted with modifications, I make no comments about it.

140    I would only say that for now, it suffices for me to apply the same sentencing framework accepted by the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, which simply requires the court to consider whether the physical and psychological harm was less or more serious. The only modification I would make to the framework for Zariah’s sentencing is to adjust the sentencing ranges to take into account the much higher maximum sentences for the offences that Zariah had been convicted of (i.e. for s 324 r/w s 73(2), s 325 r/w s 73(2) and s 326 offences). I would add that using a similar “2 x 2” sentencing framework when sentencing Zariah in this case, was also consistent with applying the “2 x 2” framework (albeit with different sentencing ranges) when sentencing Dahlan, essentially the “co-accused” for his s 323 r/w 73(2) charge.

141    Thus, for Zariah, the sentencing range that I applied for the s 324 r/w 73(2) charges, where the maximum imprisonment sentence is 10 ½ years or 126 months, is as follows:

143    In the case of Zariah, the Prosecution had highlighted that[^63]:

> (a)     The Victim‘s face, head, left ear and various parts of her shoulder and back are permanently disfigured as a result of the abuse she suffered, and that the deformities on her face and back of her head are highly visible and she will have to live with them for the rest of her life;

> (b)     Dr George Paul had noted that the 47 scars of injuries recorded in P20 may not be fully rectified even with extensive surgical intervention, given that such a prolonged period has already lapsed; and

> (c)     The Victim was also functionally impaired in her left little finger, since she is no longer able to curl this finger or place it down on things.

144    Clearly, in terms of physical harm, the Victim had suffered serious physical harm. In terms of psychological harm, I was inclined to consider that this may still fall within the “less serious psychological harm” category – albeit that the sentence should trend towards the higher end of this category. All in all, even without applying the moderate harm categories suggested by the Prosecution, I accepted the Prosecution’s suggestion that in light of the circumstances of the case, the appropriate sentencing ranges for Zariah are:

> (a)     25.5 to 63 months’ imprisonment for the s 324 r/w 73(2) charges; and

> (b)     41.25 to 90 months’ imprisonment for the s 325 r/w 73(2) and s 326 charges.

145    For Dahlan, since he essentially faced the same type of charge as the accused persons in _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_ i.e. under s 323 r/w s 73(2), which carries a maximum imprisonment term of 3 years, the same indicative range there should apply (see \[129(b)\] above).

146    Effectively, Dahlan had caused physical harm to the Victim by hitting her on the head, a vulnerable region, with the cover of a frying pan, and had thereby caused her to feel “very painful”, and to suffer a headache afterwards. Further, Dahlan was also involved with Zariah in inflicting psychological harm, albeit to a lesser degree than Zariah. While the full extent of injury that Dahlan had caused by his offence could not be precisely ascertained since the Victim was being abused by Zariah during the same period, the manner and circumstances in which Dahlan’s assault took place, and its effect on the Victim, suggested that the harm caused by his offence fell in the more serious physical harm/less serious psychological harm category, for which the imprisonment range is 6-18 months.

##### Step 3: Consider the aggravating and mitigating factors

147    The Prosecution highlighted what it considered to be aggravating factors. I have set out the factors put forward by the Prosecution, together with my views on them:

> (a)     High degree of premeditation: This was primarily based on the argument that Zariah had to execute the attacks “with more deliberation” because of her physical limitations, and had done so using weapons that she had instructed the Victim to fetch, or by asking the Victim to place her hand on the table and then pulling the Victim‘s finger backwards. However, with respect, I do not see that these circumstances by themselves show planning, premeditation or deliberation on the Victim‘s part. Instead, Zariah’s physical limitations may have been the very reason why she had to enlist the Victim‘s help to ‘effectively’ hurt herself. Thus, by themselves, these acts of Zariah’s that were highlighted by the Prosecution do not necessarily show any deliberate planning or premeditation on her part. In fact, since the offences appear to have been largely prompted by occasions of Zariah’s dissatisfaction with the standard of the Victim’s cleaning over the 6-month period, they appear more to have been carried out on the spur of the moment (when prompted by her dissatisfaction), rather than after careful consideration or deliberation by Zariah. In addition, I note that as the use of weapons is an inherent consideration in some of the charges that the Prosecution had chosen to proceed with against Zariah, this factor has already been reflected in the higher sentencing ranges for such charges.

> (b)     Abuse of authority over a vulnerable victim: This was a consideration which the Prosecution argued to be an aggravating factor. To some event, this consideration has already been taken into account by the fact that many of the charges faced by Zariah, as well as in the charge faced by Dahlan, already attract enhanced penalties (in light of s 73(2) Penal Code), because of the nature of the relationship between the perpetrator and the Victim. I was thus careful not to give this factor undue weight.

> (c)     Lack of remorse: I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused persons had shown an appalling lack of remorse in this case. Time and time again, rather than reflect on their own wrongdoings, and try to mitigate and limit the hurt and damage caused to the Victim, their conduct throughout the proceedings have shown them at their worst. Quite aside from the fact that both accused persons had claimed trial to the charges, the manner in which the Defence had dealt with the Victim before and during the trial, the various aspersions that they had cast against various parties, as well as the way the accused persons – Zariah – in particular had behaved for this case – were clearly aggravating considerations that could not be ignored.

> (d)     Attempts at cover up: The Prosecution also highlighted the numerous actions that were taken by the accused persons to cover up their wrong doings. These included the measures taken during the long period of abuse, as well as the sudden sending back of the Victim to Indonesia just before she was due to be medically examined, as well as the attempts made to settle the matter after the abuse was discovered. I accept that these actions were clearly measures aimed at preventing discovery of the offences, and attempts made by them to disguise their wrong-doings.

> (e)     Relevant antecedents and escalation of violence: After conviction, it was revealed to the court that both Zariah and Dahlan have past convictions of maid abuse, for which both accused persons had served custodial terms in prison. Yet after their release, and despite being initially subjected to an administrative ban against hiring domestic workers, both accused persons, particularly Zariah, had gone on to commit much more egregious acts of violence against yet another vulnerable victim. In the most recent episodes of aggression, both Zariah and Dahlan even turned otherwise useful household implements into objects of hurt, causing serious, permanent and debilitating injuries to their latest victim. Clearly, the serious escalation of violence on the part of the accused persons, must be addressed by the court, in terms of a corresponding and proportionate escalation in the punishment that they should receive.

148    Moving on to possible mitigating factors, there was nothing raised by counsel that could be said to be of any significant mitigating value in the present case:

> (a)     First, as regards Zariah’s physical condition, the fact that she was a stroke patient had certainly not stopped her from inflicting horrendous harm on the Victim, using otherwise helpful and harmless household implements as weapons to do so. Further, in light of the guidance provided in _Chew Soo Chun v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span> (“_Chew Soo Chun_”), the conditions for judicial mercy do not apply, nor has there been shown any evidence that imprisonment would lead to any significant deterioration or significant exacerbation of pain and suffering.

> (b)     Second, as regards Zariah purportedly being afflicted with some mental or psychiatric problem(s), I agreed with the Prosecution that, on the contrary, there was ample evidence that Zariah did not suffer any mental illness at the time of the incident. Further, in the latest IMH report from Dr Cheow (which was arrived at after Dr Cheow had referred to various medical and other assessments, including the report provided by the defence psychiatrist, Dr Leong), Zariah was not found to be suffering from any mental disorder, nor was she of unsound mind at the time of the offence. As I had noted earlier, the Defence did not challenge the latest report from Dr Cheow, and had in fact abandoned its earlier request for a Newton Hearing to be conducted on the matter. In any event, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, even if Zariah did have a mental disorder at the time of the offences, it has also not been shown that such a disorder was causally or contributorily related to the commission of the offences.

> (c)     Finally, there was nothing further raised in mitigation that was especially noteworthy. Nor was there anything that arose during the trial (e.g. any evidence of co-operation with the police), which could be said to be in favour of Zariah or Dahlan, that would reduce, in any significant way, the sentence to be imposed. Even the early promise by the accused persons (principally Dahlan) to compensate the Victim was barely carried out, and the Victim was essentially left without any real remedy or any meaningful measure to mitigate her pain and suffering.

149    Perhaps the only things that could justify any show of leniency, related to certain personal circumstances of the accused persons. In this regard, at the time of sentencing, Dahlan was already about 60 years old, and Zariah herself was close to 60 years in age. The latter had also suffered strokes which affected the left side of her body and, in the course of the trial, had to be hospitalised in relation to her health conditions. I thus took these considerations in mind when deciding on the sentences to impose.

150    In short, while there were many aspects of the Prosecution’s sentencing posture that could be broadly supported, not all the aggravating factors that they highlighted applied, at least not to the extent as to justify the sentences sought by the Prosecution for most of the charges. Instead, in line with the sentencing ranges identified above for the different types of charges, and the circumstances of the offence and the offenders, _inter alia_ : (1) the exact nature of the weapon used for the individual charges; (2) the area of the Victim‘s body that was targeted in each case; (3) the effect of the assault and the specific harm caused to the Victim including the permanency of the injury; and (4) the antecedents and relevant personal circumstances of the accused persons and other sentencing factors as discussed above, I imposed the sentences below.

> (b)     As for Dahlan, for whom the sentencing range was 6 – 18 months’ imprisonment, and for whom the Defence and Prosecution had sought imprisonment terms of 6 months and 18 months respectively, I imposed a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment, taking into account the matters set out above, and the approach set out in _Tay Wee Kiat No._ 1 (see \[129\] above).

##### Step 4: Consecutive and Concurrent Sentences

151    As for the final step in the determining the global sentence in respect of Zariah for whom there were multiple charges, I had to determine which sentences should run consecutively and which should be concurrent.

152    In _Tay Wee Kiat No. 1_, the court referred to the principles set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[27\]- \[82\], as well as the decision in _ADF_, and stated at \[75\] that “…where an offender faces multiple charges of maid abuse, the court should take into account the duration and frequency of abuse in determining whether to order more than two sentences to run consecutively (see _ADF_ at \[146(a)\]).” Specifically, it was noted that in _ADF_, the court “…ordered the three longest sentences to run consecutively to give expression to "the cumulative effect of the intentional and perverse conduct of \[the accused\] over a sustained period" (at \[155\]).”

153    In the present case, the Prosecution argued that three of the sentences should run consecutively, namely the sentences for two s 326 charge, and the sentence for the s 325 r/w 73(2) charge. This was essentially to take into account the psychological harm arising from this sustained pattern of abuse, and also the fact that Zariah’s persistent abuse “…was inflicted upon earlier injuries that were not treated or given sufficient time to recover, thus causing the Victim greater pain and suffering.” The DPP also submitted that having these three sentences run consecutively would be consistent with the approach set out in _ADF._

154    I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission for the three proposed sentences (out of the twelve sentences) to run consecutively. For about 6 months i.e. essentially most of the second half of 2014, Zariah had subjected the Victim to a prolonged and painful period of ill-treatment and abuse, and to numerous acts of aggression. Zariah’s violent conduct towards the Victim was detailed in the 12 charges that she was convicted of after a fiercely contested trial. In the circumstances, running the proposed three sentences consecutively would be consistent with the facts of the case, and with the guidance set out in _ADF_. Accordingly, I ordered that the following three sentences to run consecutively.

155    The sentences for the remaining nine charges are to run concurrently with the above sentences, for a global sentence of 132 months’ (11 years’) imprisonment.

156    While the Prosecution had characterised this case as “indubitably one of the worst cases of maid abuse in Singapore’s recent history” [^64], and had sought at least 13 years’ imprisonment for Zariah, I am of the respectful view that all things considered, a global sentence of 132 months’ (11 years’) imprisonment is fair and proportionate, is in accord with the key sentencing principles of deterrence and retribution for maid abuse cases, is in line with the relevant sentencing considerations, and is fully consistent with the totality principle.

## (10)   Compensation Orders

157    In _Soh Meiyun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 299</span>, a maid abuse case, the High Court had stated at \[56\] that:

> “Compensation orders are in effect a shortcut to the remedy that the victim could obtain in a civil suit against the offender. They are particularly suitable for Victims for whom commencing a civil suit would be impractical, and the paradigm example of such Victims are impecunious ones…**It is not controversial that domestic maids are often, if not invariably, impecunious**: see ADF at \[158\]; and for that reason I would think that **where a maid has been a victim of abuse that would prima facie be a suitable case in which to make a compensation order**.”

\[emphasis added\]

158    Further, after considering section 359(1) CPC, and various authorities, the High Court reiterated at \[60\] that “…in prosecutions **for domestic maid abuse offences, compensation orders should generally be a matter of course.**”

\[emphasis added\]

159    In the present case, Mr Niroze had, amongst other things, stated that even if there was damage suffered by the Victim: “…it must be left for her to pursue a claim as an action for damages in the Civil Court.”[^65]. With respect, such an argument by the Defence not only reflected a somewhat callous and unfeeling attitude by the accused persons towards the Victim, but also a complete disregard for the impecuniosity of the Victim, who clearly could not afford to carry out the reconstructive surgeries required because of the accused persons’ abuse. In addition, the submission of the Defence was also contrary to the position in law that compensation should ordinarily be made for such victims of maid abuse offences.

160    As for the mechanics and principles pertaining to compensation, these were expensively discussed by the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat Compensation_ (see \[5\] – \[14\]). In the present case, the Prosecution had also given a comprehensive explanation as to how it had arrived at the proposed compensation sum for the Victim (see \[114\] – \[119\] above).

161    I was satisfied with the Prosecution’s approach and agreed that the DPPs’ calculations are in line with the guidelines set out in _Tay Wee Kiat Compensation_. I further note that the Defence had essentially not challenged the compensation figures, nor the supporting medical documents and references which the Prosecution had relied on in arriving at them. Accordingly, I accept the Prosecution’s submissions as regards the basis for compensation to be awarded, the various heads of compensation and the figures arrived at.

162    As regards, the manner in which the compensation is to be apportioned between the accused persons, Zariah was clearly the main culprit and the one who committed the most number of, as well as the most serious, offences against the Victim. In contrast, Dahlan was convicted of only one charge, and a lesser charge at that. I thus agreed that Zariah should pay almost the entirely of the compensation amount i.e. $56,497.62 (in default five months’ imprisonment), while Dahlan should pay a sum of $1,000 (in default five days’ imprisonment). Dahlan’s compensation sum of $1,000 is principally for causing pain and suffering to the Victim arising from his single offence of causing hurt by hitting her on her head with the cover of a frying pan.

163    As Zariah has discontinued her appeal, there only remains the Prosecution’s appeal against Zariah’s sentence, and Dahlan’s appeal against his conviction, sentence and compensation order. In the interim, the accused persons are serving the sentences imposed.
