\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9150/2021/01.\]

30 December 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Syed Anwar Bin Hamed Alsagoff, aged 78 years old, claimed trial to two charges (“1st Charge” and “2nd Charge”) of using criminal force on two victims under 14 years of age, with the intention to outrage the modesty of the victims by such criminal force. The two charges were framed under s 354(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”).

2       A gag order was given in this case to protect the identity of the victims. As such, I shall refer to the victims as the First Victim[^1] and the Second Victim[^2].

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. I found the Accused guilty of committing the two offences and I convicted him accordingly.

4       After considering the Prosecution’s and Defence’s respective submissions on sentence, I imposed an aggregate sentence of two months’ imprisonment on the Accused. The individual sentences and the aggregate sentence are set out in Table A below:

5       The Accused filed a Notice of Appeal against conviction and sentence. Pursuant to the filing of the Notice of Appeal, I granted a stay of execution on sentence. I also allowed the Accused to go on bail pending appeal.

6       Arising from the Accused’s appeal against conviction and sentence imposed, I now provide my grounds of decision.

## Appeal against Conviction

### Undisputed Facts

7       On 1 March 2018, at about 9.40 pm, the two victims, their mother (“PW4”) and two siblings were at the NTUC FairPrice supermarket (“the supermarket”) located at the basement of Our Tampines Hub, at 1 Tampines Hub. At the material time, the First Victim was 10 years old and the Second Victim was 12 years old. PW4 was making payments at one of the self-checkout kiosks whilst the victims and their siblings waited for her outside the self-checkout kiosks’ area.

8       The Accused was also present at one of the self-checkout kiosks, paying for his purchases. After making the payment, the Accused proceeded to a small round table located near the exit of the supermarket. The Accused was carrying two plastic bags containing the items he had purchased. The Accused one plastic bag into the other. After doing so, the Accused walked backwards before turning to his right. He then walked towards the self-checkout kiosks’ area where some green NTUC shopping baskets (“the shopping baskets”) were placed.

9       The Accused walked past the First Victim as he headed towards the shopping baskets. The First Victim felt a brush of a hand on her buttocks where the direction of the motion was from left to right. The Accused reached the area where the shopping baskets were placed. He subsequently turned and walked away from the self-checkout kiosks’ area and stood a short distance behind the victims. The Accused then walked past the Second Victim from behind her. While the Accused was walking past the Second Victim, she felt a brush over her buttocks where the direction of the motion was from right to left.

10     When PW4 finished paying for her purchases, she came out of the self-checkout kiosks’ area. The Second Victim informed PW4 that somebody had touched her buttocks. PW4 questioned the Second Victim whether it could have been accidental. At this point, the First Victim informed PW4 that someone had touched her buttocks as well. The Second Victim then pointed to the Accused, who was standing behind a POSB ATM booth, and was about to leave the supermarket. The Second Victim identified the Accused as the person who had touched her to PW4.

11     The Accused left the supermarket, walked for a short distance and then sat down on a bench, where PW4, the First Victim, Second Victim and their siblings approached him. PW4 proceeded to ask the Accused whether he had touched her daughters. The Accused denied committing the acts. The Accused then stood up and made his way to an escalator. PW4 followed him and also got onto the escalator. PW4 stood a few steps in front of the Accused on the escalator. The Accused and PW4 took the escalator from the basement to level one of Our Tampines Hub where the Accused tried to leave the place. At that point, PW4 shouted for help to prevent the Accused from leaving the place. A group of passers-by assisted PW4 and stopped the Accused from leaving the place.

12     On 1 March 2018, at about 9.40 pm, the Police received a call informing of the incident. The call was reduced into a report and this formed the First Information Report (“FIR”) to this case. The FIR was admitted into evidence as Exhibit P13. Pursuant to the call, the police arrived shortly at Our Tampines Hub. Some preliminary investigations were conducted by the police at the scene. Inspector Vijayendran s/o Balakrishnan (“Insp Vijay”) was one of the police officers who had gone down to the scene. On his instructions, the police contacted the Accused’s next-of-kin. The Accused’s next-of-kin came down to Our Tampines Hub. Subsequently, the Accused and his next-of-kin made their way to the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters. Insp Vijay also made his way back to the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, albeit separately from the Accused.

13     On 2 March 2018, at around 12.53 am, Insp Vijay recorded a statement (“the Investigation Statement”) from the Accused under Section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). After providing the Investigation Statement, the Accused went home.

14     The victims were referred to Dr Parvathy d/o Pathy (“Dr Parvathy”) of the Child Guidance Clinic at the Institute of Mental Health for an assessment. On 6 August 2018, Dr Parvathy interviewed the victims and PW4. Dr Parvathy then issued a medical report on each victim \[see Exhibit P14 (in respect of the First Victim) and Exhibit P15 (in respect of the Second Victim)\].

15     On 9 September 2019, the Accused was asked to present himself at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters. The Accused arrived at around 5.20 pm. Two cautioned statements (“the Cautioned Statements”) were recorded from the Accused under Section 23 of the CPC. The recording officer was Sergeant Mohamad Isak Bin Juma’at (“Sgt Isak”).

16     The facts stated in paragraphs \[6\] to \[11\] were findings which I made based on the oral testimonies of PW4 and the victims. The facts stated in paragraphs \[6\] to \[10\] were corroborated by CCTV footages, namely, Exhibits P16A and P16B[^3]. These facts were not disputed by the Defence.

### The Prosecution’s Case

17     The Prosecution called seven witnesses to prove the charges against the Accused. The seven witnesses comprised:

> (a)     Dr Parvathy;

> (b)     Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Muzill Yamani Bin Mustazam;

> (c)     Insp Vijay;

> (d)     PW4 (the victims’ mother);

> (e)     The Second Victim;

> (f)     Sgt Isak; and

> (g)     The First Victim.

18     The material evidence would come from two victims and the CCTV footages. Notably, the CCTV footage in Exhibit P16A captured the events in respect of both charges.

19     The Cautioned Statements were admitted into evidence and marked as Exhibits P17 and P18 after an ancillary hearing. The Investigation Statement was admitted into evidence and marked as Exhibit 19 after another ancillary hearing.

20     The Prosecution also tendered a set of photographs (Exhibits P1 to P12).

#### The CCTV footages

21     The best evidence showing the incidents comes from the CCTV footages. I have viewed the CCTV footages several times during the course of the trial.

22     Having viewed the CCTV footages and having heard the oral testimonies of PW4, the First Victim, the Second Victim and the Accused, I made the following findings of fact:

#### Summary of the victims’ evidence

23     The First Victim and the Second Victim testified that the incident of outrage of modesty occurred on 1 March 2018 at the supermarket. At around 9.30 pm, the First Victim, the Second Victim and their siblings were waiting for PW4 to complete making payment at one of the self-checkout kiosks when the Accused walked past the First Victim and brushed her buttocks with his hand, from left to right.

24     Upon feeling the touch, the First Victim turned to her right and saw the Accused near the shopping baskets that were placed in front of the self-checkout kiosks’ area. The First Victim then moved to the side as she thought she was blocking the path to the exit of the self-checkout kiosks.

25     The Second Victim testified that she was standing near the self-checkout kiosks when someone walked behind her. At that moment she felt a brush on her buttocks over a large surface, in the direction from right to left. After she felt the touch on her buttocks, the Second Victim noticed the Accused as he was walking away. She initially thought that the touch was accidental. She looked behind her and realised that there was “literally no one” behind her, and that there was ample space for people to pass by behind her without touching her. This led her to conclude that the touch by the Accused could not have been accidental.

26     PW4 completed making payment and came out from the self-checkout kiosks area. The Second Victim informed PW4 that the Accused had touched her buttocks. PW4 then asked the Second Victim whether this could be accidental. When the First Victim heard the conversation between the Second Victim and PW4, she chimed in and informed PW4 that the same thing had happened to her as well.

27     The victims, their siblings and PW4 then left the supermarket to look for the Accused. The Accused was then sitting on a bench.

28     The First Victim testified that PW4 questioned the Accused who did not respond. Instead, he asked to be left alone. The Accused then stood up and walked towards the escalator going from the basement to level one of Our Tampines Hub. PW4 attempted to stop the Accused from going onto the escalator.

29     The First Victim testified that the Accused had been swaying in his walking gait as he left the supermarket and walked to the bench where he sat down. However, he could walk steadily after getting up from the bench to walk to the escalator.

30     The Second Victim testified that PW4 questioned the Accused when they saw him at the bench and that his response was that he asked to be left alone. In cross-examination, she testified that PW4 did not touch the Accused when questioning him, and instead tried to block the Accused from escaping. The Accused then stood up and walked towards the escalator. PW4 was trying to stop the Accused on the escalator. Subsequently, a passer-by called the police.

31     During the trial, the victims identified the Accused as the offender in the incident. They also testified that they had not given anyone permission to touch them in that manner.

#### The Ancillary Hearings

32     During the Prosecution’s case, the Prosecution sought to admit the Accused’s Cautioned Statements as well as his Investigation Statement. The Defence opposed the admission of these statements on the ground that the respective recorders of the statements had made threats and/or a promise to the Accused and thus the statements were not given voluntarily by the Accused.

33     In view of the objections raised, two ancillary hearings were held.

##### (1)   The First Ancillary Hearing in respect of the Cautioned Statements

(A)   Sgt Isak’s evidence

34     Sgt Isak testified that the Cautioned Statements were recorded in English from the Accused on 9 September 2019 at about 5.20 pm and 5.35 pm respectively at Bedok Divisional Headquarters. Before recording the Cautioned Statements, Sgt Isak ascertained that the Accused was comfortable to give his statement in English. He also ensured that the Accused was physically well to provide his statements. Even though the Accused complained of pain in his knees, he did not require medical attention. For each of the Cautioned Statements, Sgt Isak read the charge and the Notice of Warning _verbatim_ to the Accused, and the Accused signed on the Cautioned Statement to acknowledge that he had understood what had been read to him.

35     The Accused then wrote, with his own hand, what he wanted to say in the Cautioned Statements.

36     After the statement was given, Sgt Isak testified that he read the statement to the Accused and the Accused signed to acknowledge that the statement had been read to him. Sgt Isak testified that the handwritten statements on the fourth page of the Cautioned Statements were given voluntarily by the Accused. Sgt Isak testified that no threat, inducement or promise had been extended to the Accused during the recording of the Cautioned Statements.

37     After the recording of the Cautioned Statements was completed, Sgt Isak allowed the Accused to meet up with his sister, one Ms ‘Sharifa’ before the Accused was brought to the lock-up for registration purpose and to produce him in court the next day. After the formalities were completed, the Accused was released on bail. His bailor was Ms ‘Sharifa’.

38     During the cross-examination of Sgt Isak, Counsel highlighted two mistakes in the Cautioned Statements.

> (a)     First, in Exhibit P17, the charge sheet prepared by Sgt Isak stated that the Accused had used his right hand to brush the First Victim’s buttocks. This was erroneous because the CCTV footage _ie_ Exhibit P16A showed that it was the Accused’s left hand that had come in contact with the First Victim’s buttocks.

> (b)     Second, on the second page of each of the Cautioned Statements, Sgt Isak had erroneously served a type-written charge of an offence of being a member of an unlawful assembly under section 143 of the PC to the Accused.

Sgt Isak admitted to his mistakes. With regard to the first error, Sgt Isak explained that from his investigations he recalled the Accused using his right hand to commit the offences. With regard to the second error, he admitted to it but he was unable to give an explanation for this error.

39     During Sgt Isak’s cross-examination, the Defence’s case that was put to him was that the Accused had denied committing the offence. This was at the stage after the Notice of Warning had been read and served on the Accused. The Accused’s instructions which the Defence put across to Sgt Isak were that the Accused had said “I’m not guilty. It’s just an accident.” The Accused also said “I didn’t do it deliberately. I don’t even remember. I accidentally knocked into them. I don’t even remember knocked into the girls.”[^8] It was also alleged that Sgt Isak threatened the Accused by stating “If you don’t admit, I will have to put you in the lock-up.” Sgt Isak disagreed that these allegations took place.

40     The Defence also put to Sgt Isak that the recording process, which took a mere ten minutes to record each statement, was a set-up because Sgt Isak wanted the Accused to admit to the offences. Sgt Isak denied the allegation.

(B)   The Accused’s evidence

41     The Accused testified that after the charge on the first page in Exhibit P17 was read to him, he denied committing the offence. His evidence was that he said “No, I didn’t do it. I deny.” Sgt Isak then threatened to put him in the lock-up if he did not sign on the charge sheet. Under such threat, he then signed the charge sheet. The same threat was repeated for the second and third pages. When it came to the fourth page, he wrote the statement himself after getting some advice from Sgt Isak to make some pleas for leniency. Thereafter, he was threatened again that he would be sent to the lock-up if he did not sign on that page. Under such threat, he then signed the fourth page of Exhibit P17.

42     With regard to the recording of his statement in Exhibit P18, the Accused testified that Sgt Isak repeated what he had done and he reacted in the same manner (see \[41\] above).

43     During the Accused’s cross-examination, he admitted that when the charges in the Cautioned Statements were read to him, he did not think he was being charged with the offence under s 143 of the PC (see \[38(b)\] above). He was aware that he was being investigated for and charged with the offence of outrage of modesty under section 354(2) of the PC.

(C)   Court’s Assessment and Findings

44     The approach to disputes over admissibility of an accused person’s statement is set out in _Sulaiman bin Jumari v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 557</span> (_“Sulaiman bin Jumari”_) at \[54\]:

> First, was the statement given voluntarily based on the requirements set out in s 258(3) of the CPC?

>> (i)    If the statement was involuntary due to an inducement, threat or promise within the meaning of s 258(3) of the CPC, then it shall be excluded and that is the end of the admissibility inquiry.

>> (ii)   If the statement was voluntary, the enquiry proceeds to the second step.

> Second, even if the statement was voluntary, would the prejudicial effect of the statement outweigh its probative value? This is a discretionary exercise and the court’s foremost concern is in evaluating the reliability of the statement in the light of the specific circumstances in which it was recorded.

45     The Prosecution bears the legal burden of proof to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statement was given voluntarily: _Sulaiman bin Jumari_ at \[36\]. The test of voluntariness is partly objective and partly subjective: _Chia Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 619</span> at \[53\], which is reproduced below:

> … The test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise, and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge

46     The main issue to determine was whether the threat was objectively made. Having assessed the Accused’s oral testimonies against his instructions that the Defence put to Sgt Isak (see \[39\] _cf_ \[41\]), I found the Accused to have provided inconsistent accounts of the events relating to the recording of the Cautioned Statements. I rejected the Accused’s testimony. On the contrary, I found Sgt Isak to be a credible witness. I therefore found that Sgt Isak did not make any threat to the Accused.

47     I reproduced below, a significant aspect of the Accused’s evidence whilst under cross-examination:

> Q:    Now, this seems different from what you have just told the Court earlier. Now, let me clarify. Did Sergeant Isak threaten you to put you into the lock-up if you did not sign or did he threaten you to put you in the lock-up if you do not write what you wrote on page 4?

> A    If I don’t sign

> Q    If you don’t sign?

> A    I will go to lock-up---lock-up

48     From the above extract, it was clear to me that the Accused had written his statements on the fourth page of Exhibits P17 and P18 without any threat operating on him. More importantly, the statements were handwritten by him. If he had wanted to deny the commission of the offences, he could have done so since he had control of the pen. In my assessment, the Accused wrote whatever he wanted to write in the Cautioned Statements.

49     I was not persuaded by the Defence’s argument that the recording took a mere ten minutes because Sgt Isak had set-up the process in order to extract a confession. I noted that the Accused was comfortable testifying in English. He was able to read and understand the documentary exhibits. I found that the Accused’s ability to use English proficiently was the reason that the recording process for each statement was completed within ten minutes.

50     In conclusion, I found that the Cautioned Statements were given by the Accused voluntarily. The Cautioned Statements were thus admitted into evidence.

51     The contents of the Accused’s Cautioned Statements, which were identical for both Exhibits P17 and P18, read as follow:

> I hope I can be given a chance to be pardoned and I plead leniency. I hope the judge will not put me in prison.

> I am old and diagnosed with a lot of sickness. I hope the State will consider this matter.

##### (2)   The Second Ancillary Hearing in respect of the Investigation Statement

(A)   Insp Vijay’s evidence

52     Insp Vijay testified that he recorded the Investigation Statement from the Accused in English on 2 March 2018 at 12.53 am at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters. Before recording the Investigation Statement, Insp Vijay ascertained that the Accused was comfortable to give his statement in English. He also ensured that the Accused was physically well to give the Investigation Statement, despite the late hour. He also ascertained that the Accused did not require any medical attention.

53     The recording of the Accused’s Investigation Statement commenced with the formality of obtaining the Accused’s personal particulars, which were voluntarily provided.

54     Insp Vijay testified that when recording the five paragraphs comprising the Investigation Statement, he asked the Accused’s open-ended questions such as “actually what happened that day”, “let me know the sequence of events”, _etc_. He then paraphrased the answers he had obtained from the Accused and typed them onto his laptop, presumably using a document software.

55     After completing the recording of the statement, Insp Vijay turned the laptop screen to face the Accused. The Accused was allowed to read the statement. Insp Vijay also read the statement aloud to the Accused. Thereafter, a hardcopy of the statement was printed. Again, the Accused was allowed to read the statement on his own. Insp Vijay also read it to him. Insp Vijay then asked the Accused whether he had any amendments he would like to make to the statement. The Accused elected not to make any amendments. The Accused was referred to a typewritten clause at the end of the Investigation Statement which states:

> Statement read and explained to me in English, and I affirm it to be true and correct. No threat, inducement or promises were made to me.

56     Insp Vijay testified that after the Accused had confirmed that he had no amendments to make to the statement, the Accused signed on both pages of the statement. The Accused also signed above the said typewritten clause and appended his identity card number. Insp Vijay concluded his testimony for the ancillary hearing by identifying the CCTV footage in Exhibit 16A as the same footage that he had referred to the Accused during the recording of the statement.

57     During Insp Vijay’s cross-examination, the Defence sought an explanation from him for the omission in stating the open-ended questions in the statement. Insp Vijay replied that he had opted not to use the question and answer format. Insp Vijay testified that despite this, there was no information provided by the Accused which was not included in the statement.

58     The Defence also asked Insp Vijay why the Accused’s answers had been paraphrased instead of being recorded _verbatim_. The Defence alleged that the Accused disputed various facts stated in paragraph \[3\] of the statement. But Insp Vijay ignored him and thereafter came up with the version now shown in paragraph \[3\]. Insp Vijay denied the allegations. He testified that he listened to the Accused’s responses to his questions and paraphrased the answers when typing each paragraph. He then read the paragraphs to the Accused to ensure that they were accurate. Therefore, the statement consisted of the Accused’s own words and admissions, albeit paraphrased. The Defence made the same allegation with regards to paragraph \[4\] of the statement. Insp Vijay denied the allegation. With regard to the last sentence in paragraph \[5\] of the statement, the Defence asserted that the words came from Insp Vijay and not the Accused. Again, Insp Vijay denied the allegation.

59     The Defence also alleged that Insp Vijay had told the Accused that he had to sign the Investigation Statement and said to the Accused, “if you don’t sign, you will be detained” and further, “If you sign, you will be released and there would be no charge against you.” Insp Vijay denied making the threat and the promise to the Accused.

(B)   Evidence of the Accused

60     The Accused testified that he was interviewed by Insp Vijay and the signatures on the Investigation Statement belonged to him. He admitted that he made all the statements in paragraph \[2\] of the statement, and that these were in response to questions asked by Insp Vijay. The Accused then stated that he did not make the statements at paragraph \[3\], and that these were added by Insp Vijay of his own volition. With regard to the paragraph \[4\] of the statement, the Accused testified that he also did not state the contents from the fourth line to the end of the paragraph. The Accused alleged that Insp Vijay read the contents of paragraph \[4\] of the Investigation Statement to him as he typed, and the Accused denied committing the offences at this stage. The Accused claimed that these were included by Insp Vijay without his knowledge. The Accused also claimed that paragraph \[5\] were also the words of Insp Vijay, although he did agree to other portions of paragraph \[5\] such as the description of his attire and being shown a CCTV footage on Insp Vijay’s handphone. The Accused denied stating the last sentence in paragraph \[5\]. He also testified that the statement was not read to him in its entirety and he did not affirm that it was true and correct.

61     The Accused testified that he signed the statement despite the foregoing discrepancies and inaccuracies because Insp Vijay promised him that if he signed the statement, he would not be detained and there would be no charge against him.

(C)   Court’s Assessment and Findings

62     The law regarding the admissibility of statements is set out at paragraphs \[44\] and \[45\] above.

63     During my deliberation on this ancillary hearing, I was mindful not to look at the content of the statement even though the Defence made reference to some parts of the statement. The statement consisted of five paragraphs only. The crux of the Accused’s testimony was that paragraphs \[1\] and \[2\] were given by him voluntarily. For paragraphs \[3\] to \[5\], it was alleged that as Insp Vijay was typing it, he read it aloud, to which the Accused was able to voice his disagreement to several parts in paragraphs \[3\] to \[5\]. But Insp Vijay ignored his protestations. It struck me as odd that the Accused agreed to paragraph \[5\] save for the last sentence. In my assessment, the Accused was cherry-picking in an attempt to eliminate portions of the statement that were either not neutral or favourable to him.

64     The statement was then reproduced and printed on paper. At this stage, the Accused’s signature on the hardcopy was needed to complete the statement recording process. Despite disputing the contents of paragraphs \[3\] to \[5\] of the statement, the Accused appended his signatures on both pages of the statement. He then alleged that he was not given the opportunity to read the statement. Nor was the statement read to him. The Defence even alleged that the statement was not explained to the Accused. However, Insp Vijay was able to rebut the allegation by testifying that he had to explain the sequence of the events to the Accused so that he could obtain his agreement that the sequences were recorded correctly. The Accused, who was proficient in English, would have been able to read the content of the statement. Therefore, his claim that he was not aware of the contents of the Investigation Statement appeared disingenuous.

65     The presence of the Accused’s signature on the statement was certainly an obstacle that the Accused had to overcome, especially where he had appended his signature to acknowledge that the statement had been read to him and he affirmed it to be true and correct. Hence, he alleged that Insp Vijay threatened to detain him if he did not sign. He also alleged that Insp Vijay told him that he would be released and would not be charged if he agreed to sign the statement.

66     I did not find the Accused to be a credible witness and I rejected his testimony. On the contrary, I found Insp Vijay to be a credible witness.

67     In the circumstances, at the end of the second ancillary hearing, having considered the totality of evidence before me, I found that the Investigation Statement was given by the Accused voluntarily and it was recorded by Insp Vijay without any threat, promise or inducement. The Investigation Statement was thus admitted into evidence and marked as Exhibit P19.

68     The material portions of the Accused’s Investigation Statement are reproduced below:

> 3    After making payment I then went to the table nearby to check the items that I had earlier bought. While I was checking my items I noticed 2 young Chinese girls standing at the exit of the kiosk, and I decided to touch the buttocks as I felt the urge to do so. I walked pass the first girl from behind and used my right hand and slide it against her buttocks. She turned around and looked at me, but I did not say sorry and just act like nothing happened. After that I decided to touch the other girl, and I also walked from her behind and again used my right hands to slide and brush the buttocks of the other girl.

> 4    I was then resting nearby the NTUC at the sofa, and the mother of both the girls approached me and asked me if I had touched the daughters. I was then very scared and told her that it was an accident. I did not apologise to her, but she did not believe me and called for the Police. I wish to state that I really don’t know why I did such a stupid thing, and this is the first time such a thing has happened. I’m also very ashamed for what I have done, and this is my first Police case.

#### Close of the Prosecution’s case

69     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence did not make a submission of no case to answer. I was satisfied that the evidence satisfied each and every element of the two charges. A _prima facie_ case was made out against the Accused. I therefore called upon the Accused to enter his defence.

### The Defence’s Case

70     The Defence called two witnesses comprising:

> (a)     The Accused; and

> (b)     Yee Yiu Wah Ringo (“DW2”).

71     The Defence adduced a medical report from Singapore Heart Centre dated 19 April 2018 (Exhibit D1). Exhibit D1 was admitted into evidence by consent. A physiotherapy report of the Accused from Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 27 November 2019 (Exhibit D2) was adduced through DW2.

#### Summary of the evidence of the Accused

72     The Accused elected to give oral testimony. The crux of the Accused’s defence was that he did not brush the buttocks of the two victims. If he had done so, this was either accidental or were a result of his medical condition of cervical myelopathy and his unsteady gait.

73     The Accused’s actions and behaviour in respect of the two charges were captured by the CCTV footages in Exhibits P16A and P16B, which I have set out in \[22\] above.

#### Summary of the evidence of Mr. Yee Yiu Wah Ringo (“DW 2”)

74     DW2 is a physiotherapist from Tan Tock Seng Hospital. DW2 was called by the Defence to explain the physiotherapy report (Exhibit D2) of the Accused as the physiotherapist who had prepared D2 was overseas.

75     The Accused suffered from unsteady gait and cervical myelopathy (see Exhibit D2).

> (a)     DW2 was able to confirm that from the hospital’s assessment and observation of the Accused, the Accused has a risk of falling easily as his gait was not steady. This was thus classified as unsteady gait.

> (b)     DW2 explained that cervical myelopathy meant that the Accused’s spinal cord was compressed. When the spine was compressed, it could affect a person’s limb functions by causing weakness, numbness and pain or other symptoms, which could in turn affect a person’s balance. In cross-examination, DW2 conceded that he could not determine the severity of the Accused’s cervical myelopathy without conducting a clinical assessment and performing a scan on the Accused. The present case took place on 1 March 2018. Exhibit D2 was dated 27 November 2019 and it referred to physiotherapy treatments on 29 Oct 2019 and 5 November 2019. These therapy sessions took place almost 20 months after the present case. As such, DW2 testified that it would not be possible to determine the severity of the Accused’s cervical myelopathy at the time of the incident.

76     The Accused also suffered from osteoarthritis of the knees (referred to as “OA knees” in Exhibit D1). DW2 explained that osteoarthritis of the knees is not related to gait disturbance and that persons with osteoarthritis of the knees could walk steadily. As the Accused was not DW2’s patient, DW2 did not have any knowledge of the Accused’s gait. DW2 was asked to give his opinion on the Accused’s gait based on the CCTV footages, but he declined.

77     Finally, DW2 testified that the earliest record of a medical appointment by the Accused at Tan Tock Seng Hospital as per the hospital’s records, was 21 October 2019.

### Court’s Assessment of the Evidence and Findings

### Elements of the offence

78     Section 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) states:

> (1)    Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

> (2)    Whoever commits an offence under subsection (1) against any person under 14 years of age shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

79     The Prosecution has to prove the following elements of the charge:

> (a)     The First Victim and the Second Victim were below 14 years old at the material time. This element of the charge was not disputed by the Defence.

> (b)     The Accused used criminal force on the victims by using his hand to brush against their buttocks; and

> (c)     The Accused performed the said acts with the intention to outrage the victims’ modesty.

#### Approach to assessing the evidence

80     There have been numerous case authorities that discusses the approach a trial court should take when assessing evidence emerging from a trial involving sexual offences. It is well-established that in a case where no other evidence is available, a victim’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt (see section 136 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) ) – but only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration: _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> at \[111\] and followed in _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”) at \[89\].

81     In the present case, the “unusually convincing” standard does not apply as the evidence of the victims was corroborated by the CCTV footages. There was also the admission by the Accused in his Investigation Statement.

82     Bearing in mind the above, I turn now to my assessment and evaluation of the evidence.

#### The CCTV footages

83     The CCTV footages clearly show contact being made between the Accused’s left hand and the First Victim’s buttock at the 0:00:20 mark. Prior to this, the Accused was seen shifting his plastic bag from his right hand to his left hand, and shortly after he had done so, he extended his left hand to touch the buttock of the First Victim. In this regard, the CCTV footage clearly corroborated the account by the First Victim that she felt a touch on her buttocks.

84     The Second Victim’s version of events was also corroborated by the CCTV footage. The CCTV footage showed the Accused now holding on to the plastic bag with his left hand. As he walked past the Second Victim, his right hand was closest to the Second Victim. Although it is not clearly visible whether the Accused’s right hand made contact with the Second Victim’s buttocks, I made the finding that he had done so based on the following:

> (a)     The Second Victim reacted immediately upon feeling a touch on her buttocks;

> (b)     The Accused walked behind her even though there was no crowding and there was nobody behind the Second Victim; and

> (c)     The Accused walked past her from her right to left and that was how she felt the touching motion on her buttocks.

85     In addition, the Accused, by his own admission, could control his general direction of travel. Given that there was no other person behind the victims, and there was sufficient room for two persons to pass without any contact, in my assessment, there was no valid basis to the Accused’s claims that his touching of the victims’ buttocks was accidental.

86     I have viewed the CCTV footages several times in the course of the trial. In my judgment, it was clear to me that the Accused was able to control his walking motion. There was no doubt in my assessment that the Accused had chosen his victims and he had deliberately walked close to them or behind them to touch them on their buttocks with his hand. The _actus reus_ of the two charges have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I rejected the Accused’s evidence that the touches on the victims’ buttocks were accidental. In this regard, DW2’s evidence did not assist the Accused at all. DW2’s evidence was neutral at best and thus insufficient to cast a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case.

#### Preferring the Testimonies of the Victims

87     The Defence submitted that the Accused’s evidence was consistent and ought to be preferred. I disagreed. The Accused’s evidence was totally at odds with the CCTV footages. I found the Accused to be an unreliable witness.

88     I found the victims to be truthful and credible witnesses.

> (a)     Their testimonies did not waiver despite intensive cross-examination by the Defence.

> (b)     The totality of their evidence was internally and externally consistent. In this regard, I accepted in full the Prosecution’s submission at \[22\] and \[23\] of its written closing submissions (Exhibit B).

> (c)     This trial was not the first time that the victims had to give their versions of the incident. They had given a consistent account to PW1 back in August 2018.

#### The weight to be according to the Investigation Statement

89     The Prosecution submitted that the Investigation Statement should be accorded full weight in terms of reflecting the _mens rea_ of the Accused. The Prosecution relied on paragraph \[3\] of the Investigation Statement (see \[68\] above where I have reproduced extracts of the Investigation Statement).

90     The Defence submitted that little or no weight should be accorded to the Investigation Statement as it was given under threat, inducement and promise. At the ancillary hearing, I rejected the Defence’s case and found that the Investigation Statement was given voluntarily by the Accused. During the Defence’s case at the main trial, the Accused did not proffer any new evidence to substantiate his allegations. In my assessment, the Investigation Statement was recorded in a logical and chronological sequence. It started with his personal background and medical conditions at paragraph \[1\]; paragraph \[2\] gave the background to his presence at the supermarket on the day of the incident; paragraph \[3\] narrated the events of the outrage of modesty and his state of mind; paragraph \[4\] dealt with his confrontation with PW4, the victims’ mother; and it ended with paragraph \[5\] where the Accused identified himself in the CCTV footage which Insp Vijay had shown to him. In my assessment, the Investigation Statement should be given its full weight and I did so.

91     The Defence raised two further issues with the Investigation Statement. First, that there was an error in the alleged admission at paragraph \[3\] of the Investigation Statement, which stated that the Accused slid his right hand across the buttock of the First Victim. This was incorrect because the CCTV footage showed that the Accused used his left hand. Second, the Investigation Statements were not the exact words of the Accused because the Accused’s answers were paraphrased by Insp Vijay.

92     In respect of the first issue raised by the Defence, this error was not material and insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. The objective evidence showed that the Accused used his left hand to touch the buttocks of the First Victim. Paragraph \[4\] of the Investigation Statement provided an account of the Accused’s state of mind at time of the commission of the offence.

93     In respect of the second issue raised by the Defence, I accepted Insp Vijay’s testimony that he had read and explained the statement to the Accused. The Accused had read the statement on his own as well. Thereafter, the Accused had affirmed the statement to be true and accurate. He had elected not to make any amendments to his statement. In a nutshell, the Accused had accepted contents of the Investigating Statement as emanating from him.

94     For the reasons given in \[90\], \[92\] and \[93\] above, I rejected the Defence’s submission that little or no weight should be accorded to the Investigation Statement.

95     I found, on account of the admissions made by the Accused at paragraphs \[3\] and \[4\] of the Investigation Statement, that the Accused had touched the victims’ buttocks with the intention to outrage their modesty.

#### The weight to be accorded to the Cautioned Statements

96     Whilst I have ruled that the Cautioned Statements were given by the Accused voluntarily, it is a separate issue when I have to assess the weight to be attached to them.

97     The offence on the first page and the offence on the second page of each of the Cautioned Statements were totally different. This was a fundamental mistake by the recorder. The cautioned statement affords an offender the opportunity to state his defence to the offence he is facing. An offender’s failure or omission to state his defence in the cautioned statement may lead to the dire consequence that his defence at the trial may be less likely to be believed. It is thus crucial that the offence in a cautioned statement should be correctly stated. The recorder must get his process right from on the onset of the statement recording process. I did not think it right that such a fundamental error should be brushed aside merely because the Accused was not influenced by the said error. For this reason, I did not accord any weight to the Cautioned Statements.

### Conviction of the Accused

98     Having considered all the evidence adduced at the trial, I found that the Prosecution had proven the essential elements of each charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.

## Appeal against Sentence

### The Sentencing Framework

99     The applicable sentencing framework for an offence of outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the PC is set out in _GBR v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”) which I have summarised below:

> Step 1 Consider the offence-specific factors comprising

>> (a)       Degree of sexual penetration;

>> (b)       Circumstances of the offence;

>> (c)       Harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological.

> Within each category, there are other factors that a sentencing court should consider _eg_ the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, the duration of the outrage of modesty, whether there is skin-to-skin contact, presence of premeditation, use of force or violence, abuse of a position of trust, exploitation of a vulnerable victim, _etc._

> Step 2 Once the gravity of the offence has been ascertained based on the non-exhaustive factors in Step 1, the sentencing court should place the offence within an appropriate band of imprisonment which is summarised below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.82%"> <col width="42.3%"> <col width="24.78%"> <col width="20.1%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Description</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentencing Guideline</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Caning</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one of the aggravating factors, for example, those that involve a fleeting touch or a touch over the clothes of the victim, and do not involve the intrusion into the victim’s private parts.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than one year’s imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Generally, not imposed</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where two or more of the aggravating factors present themselves.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to three years’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 3 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Where numerous of the aggravating factors present themselves, including the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to five years’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">At least 6 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> Step 3 The sentencing court must take into account aggravating and mitigating factors which relate to the offender generally, but which are not offence-specific. These would include, but not limited to, factors such the number of charges taken into consideration, the lack of remorse, timeous plea of guilt, or the presence of a mental disorder or intellectual disability on the part of the accused.

### The Prosecution’s address on sentence

100    The Prosecution highlighted that there was no intrusion into the victims’ private parts as the touches were on the victim’s buttocks. The touches were over clothing and the transgressions lasted for a fairly short period of time. The degree of sexual exploitation was thus low. Furthermore, no physical or psychological harm was reported by the victims. However, the two victims were only 10 and 12 years old at the time of the incidents. Accordingly, they should be treated as vulnerable victims. The young age of the victims was thus an aggravating factor that warranted the imposition of a custodial sentence. The Prosecution further stressed that the Accused committed both offences in quick succession.

101    The Prosecution placed the present case within Band 1 of _GBR’s_ sentencing bands. The Prosecution thus sought a sentence of three to four months’ imprisonment.

### The Defence Plea-in-Mitigation and Address on Sentence

102    The Defence likewise referred to the same offence-specific factors and agreed that the present case fell within the lower end of Band 1 of _GBR_’s sentencing bands. The Defence also argued that the commission of the offences did not involve any premeditation, use of force or violence, abuse of a position of trust or deception.

103    The Defence highlighted the following offender-specific factors:

> (a)     The Accused is an elderly first-time offender with medical conditions;

> (b)     The fact that the Accused had claimed trial is a neutral factor:

> (c)     There was no escalation of physical contact insofar as there was no increase in the degree of sexual exploitation.

104    In its assessment, the Defence submitted that a fine would be appropriate.

### Court’s Decision on Sentence

#### Applicable sentencing principles

105    The sentencing principles of general deterrence and specific deterrence were applied in this case.

106    Children should feel safe to be able to walk freely in a public in a space such as a community centre, and to accompany their parents in everyday activities such as grocery shopping. This did not happen in the present case for the offences were committed against vulnerable victims who were with their mother at the supermarket. General deterrence in sentencing was thus needed. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender.

107    The Accused had acted deliberately in committing these offences. Therefore, specific deterrence in sentencing was also applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an accused to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition (see _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> at \[25\] – \[29\]).

108    I agreed with the Prosecution’s and Defence’s submission that the present case fell within the lower end of Band 1 of _GBR’s_ sentencing benchmark. Nonetheless, given the need to protect vulnerable victims and also to deter the commission of such offences against vulnerable victims, I was satisfied that the custodial threshold had been crossed in this case.

109    In _PP v Palanisami Mohankumar_ (District Arrest Case No 501215 of 2013) (_“Palanisami”_) which was referred to at \[32\] of _GBR_, the offender was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment when he put his hand through a window and rested it on the thigh of an 11-year-old female victim. A similar charge was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. In my judgment, _Palanisami’s_ case was presented with an additional aggravating factor in that the offender has committed trespass by putting his hand through the window. In my judgment, the sentence in our present case should not be more than that given in _Palanisami’s_ case.

110    In our present case, given the fleeting nature of the touches, I placed the starting indicative sentence at two months’ imprisonment for each charge.

#### Calibrating for other aggravating and mitigating factors

111    Having established the starting indicative sentence for each charge, I then proceeded to consider whether there could be any other aggravating factors that would warrant an uplift, or whether there were any mitigating features that would call for a reduction of the indicative starting sentences. I found that there were no other culpability-enhancing circumstances on each charge. I also found that there weren’t any offender-specific aggravating factors.

112    Turning to the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation, I found that the Accused was a first-time offender. The Accused’s absence of previous criminal antecedent is a neutral factor. It is not necessarily positive evidence of good character and should not be taken as mitigating (see _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> at \[65\]). The fact that he had claimed trial was also a neutral factor. A sentencing discount that is often given to an offender who has elected to plead guilty would not apply to the Accused.

113    The Defence submitted that there was no further act of transgression that would increase the degree of sexual exploitation. It is trite that the absence of an aggravating factor does not make it a mitigating factor.

114    Having regard to all of the above, I did not see any justification to adjust the indicative starting sentence for each charge. As such, I imposed a sentence of two months’ imprisonment on each charge.

#### Aggregate Sentence

115    The next step in sentencing was to consider the appropriate aggregate sentence for this case.

116    The two offences were committed on the same day, in same vicinity within thirty seconds of each other, although they were committed against different victims. Therefore, I ordered the two sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. The aggregate sentence was therefore two months’ imprisonment.
