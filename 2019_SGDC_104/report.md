22 May 2019

### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

Annadurai s/o Periyasamy (the accused), a 48-year-old male, was convicted after a trial, of 1 charge of consumption of methamphetamine, a specified drug, under section 8(b)(ii) and punishable under section 33A (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) Chapter 185. The charge is commonly referred to as a ‘Long Term Imprisonment 2” (LT2) charge as he had previously been convicted of a similar offence of consumption of morphine, a specified drug, an LT1 charge on the 27 July 2004, which conviction and punishment has not been set aside.

2       The accused was sentenced to serve 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. He is now appealing against his conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s case

3       The prosecution called 8 witnesses to prove their case. They consisted of police officers from the Singapore Police Force, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and 2 analysts from the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore (HSA).

#### The Arrest

4       The arresting officer is SSgt Muhammad Ridhwan Bin Borhan (SSgt Ridhwan), PW1, a police officer with the Jurong Police Division. He testified that on the 15 February 2018 he was dispatched to attend to a case of a caller, identified to be the accused, who had made a call saying that his friend had stolen his wallet. (A copy of the excerpt of the 999 call was admitted as P2). SSgt Ridhwan went to Block(Blk) 168, Bukit Batok Avenue and met the accused. He observed that the accused was slurred in speech, had bloodshot eyes and was walking with an unsteady gait

5       Upon being told by the accused that the friend who had stolen the wallet lived on the second floor of the Blk, SSgt Ridhwan went to the corner unit which the accused said was occupied by the friend and knocked on the door, but there was no response. He placed the accused under arrest on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug, brought him to the Jurong police division and lodged the arrest report, P1. At the police division, the accused complained that he felt giddy and he was escorted to the Singapore General Hospital for a check-up. The doctor certified that the accused was fine and fit for detention. The accused was brought back to the police division.

#### The Urine Procurement Process

6       At the said police Division, on the 16 February 2018, a Friday, Sergeant Muhammad Nur Hafriz Bin Rosli (Sgt Hafriz), PW2, was assigned to procure the urine samples of the accused. He took the accused to a room where a stockpile of new bottles for urine samples to be kept in, were stored. The accused selected 1 master bottle with a red cap out of 10 bottles and 2 small bottles with blue caps from 20 bottles. Sgt Hafriz escorted the accused into the male toilet and told him to wash his hands. The accused then urinated into the master bottle and from this bottle, he poured his urine into the 2 small bottles. Thereafter, Sgt Hafriz sealed the 3 bottles with masking tape, placed them inside a tamper proof polymer bag and instructed the accused to hold the bag.

7       The next witness for the prosecution, Sergeant Muhammmad Irfan Bin Zufri (Sgt Irfan), PW3, a CNB officer, was the instant urine test (IUT) operator. When he approached the accused, the latter was holding a bag of bottles which contained his urine samples. Sgt Irfan siphoned some urine from the master bottle with the red cap into a test tube. He disposed the master bottle. The 2 small bottles of urine samples remained with the accused. Sgt Irfan conducted the IUT of the sample from the master bottle and the result was positive. He then printed the urine test result slip, P3, and the labels which had the accused’s particulars which included the name and the NRIC number. He asked the accused to check his particulars.

8       The sealing officer for this case was Staff Sergeant Tan Tze Hsien Glen (SSgt Tan), PW4, a police officer. He sealed the two bottles of urine samples belonging to the accused in his presence. He showed the urine labels to the accused who initialled on the labels after he confirmed his personal particulars on them were accurate. The accused confirmed that the urine samples in the 2 bottles were his urine and he deposited the 2 bottles in a locked metal container. SSgt Tan kept the metal container in a freezer. On the next working day, the 19 of February 2018, Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Elfi Bin Nadin (SSSgt Elfi), PW5, a CNB officer, sent the urine samples to the HSA for analysis. He testified that only the staff of HSA had the key to the metal container.

#### The Medication Verification

9       SSSgt Elfi is also the former investigating officer. He checked with Bukit Batok Polyclinic and Tan Tock Seng Hospital(TTSH) on the medication given to the accused. This was because the accused claimed that his urine had tested positive as he had consumed medication. The accused did not mention that his friend had spiked his drink and robbed him. The list from the polyclinic which indicated the dates that the accused attended at the polyclinic and the medication that was prescribed to him was admitted as P4. A similar list from TTSH was admitted as P5. SSSgt Elfie then verified with the HSA and was told that the medication prescribed in P4 and P5, will not give rise to any controlled drug in the accused’s urine samples.

#### Ms Kwok Yi Ling Miiko (Ms Kwok), PW6 and Ms Chan Si Jia (Ms Chan), PW7: The HSA Analysts

10     Ms Kwok, an analyst with the HSA issued the certificate, P6, dated the 20 February 2018, under section 16 of the MDA. This certificate stated that methamphetamine was found in the urine sample of the accused. She confirmed that the presence of methamphetamine in the urine sample of the accused was consistent with the consumption of methampetamine. Ms Kwok was referred to P4 and P5 and she testified that the consumption of the medication stated in the 2 exhibits will not give rise to the presence of methamphetamine in the accused’s urine sample.

11     The evidence of Ms Chan, another analyst from HSA, was more or less similar to Ms Kwok. The certificate, P7, she issued was dated 2 March 2018 and it also stated that methamphetamine was found in the urine sample of the accused. She agreed with Ms Kwok that none of the medication listed in P4 and P5 will result in methamphetamine being detected in the urine sample and that the consumption of methamphetamine will give rise to the presence of methamphetamine in the accused’s urine sample.

#### Staff Sergeant Vinod Kumaran (SSgt Vinod), PW8: The Investigating Officer

12     SSgt Vinod served the charge on the accused and recorded his cautioned statement. The accused raised the defence of spiking. He said that his friend, one Nasir, gave him something to drink. Other than the name “Nasir” the accused did not give other details. SSgt Vinod conducted his own investigation and ascertained that there was no such male person staying in the unit, Blk 168, #XXX Bukit Batok West Avenue 8, indicated by the accused as Nasir’s residence, which the accused had told the police officer who attended to him at the scene.

13     On the 25 March 2019 at about 6.20 p.m. SSgt Vinod went to the above address and met, one Isa Bin Ahmad, the owner of the flat. Isa said that he has been residing at the flat with his wife and two daughters since 1999. When he was divorced in 2018, his wife and 2 daughters left the flat and he is now staying alone. He does not know anyone by the name of “Nasir” and was sure that after his release from prison in 2014, no person by the name of “Nasir” had stayed in the flat.

14     When the accused mentioned that the Nasir who allegedly spiked his drink, is a drug supervisee at Jurong Police Station, SSgt Vinod conducted further screenings in order to ascertain whether Nasir can be located. The accused had revealed that Nasir, a male Malay, is between 50 to 52 years of age and he knows him as Mohd Nasir. Using various different ways of spelling Nasir’s name, including “Naseer”, “Nasseer”, “Nazir”, “Nazeer” and “Nazzeer” SSgt Vinod was told that there was no such drug supervisee. When he tried “Nasir”, he found 2 supervisees consisting of a 42-year old residing in Jurong West and a 56-year old Nasir (without Mohammed) residing in Marsiling.

## The Defence

15     The accused denied that he had consumed any methamphetamine. He testified that on the morning of the 15 of February 2018, around 8 or 9 am, he went to Nasir’s flat which is located on the 2nd floor of Blk 168 Bukit Batok West Avenue. He spoke to Nasir and asked him whether he was interested to join him to work as a “karang guni”. They had a discussion. He went to Nasir’s refrigerator and asked for a drink. Nasir told him he could drink the milk. The accused took a banana flavoured milk packet. Nasir then took a glass and the accused poured the milk into the glass.

16     After drinking from the glass, the accused fell asleep and found himself waking up feeling numb and subsequently he went down to the void deck and felt stomach pains. He tried to contact Nasir but there was no response. He found money missing from his wallet and suspected that Nasir had spiked his drink and stole his money, amounting to $350. He called the police and reported what had happened, as stated in P2.

17     In cross-examination, the accused disclosed that by the time he poured the milk into the glass he had already drank half from the packet directly. He suspected that Nasir spiked his drink to steal his money. He denied that he had raised the medication defence in the course of investigation.

## The Decision

18     This was a case where the 2 HSA certificates, P6 and P7, under section 16 of the MDA indicated that methamphetamine, a specified drug, was found in the urine samples of the accused which he provided on the 16 of February 2018. His samples had been procured in accordance with the procedures laid out in the MDA (Urine procurement and Urine tests) Regulations. The accused did not challenge the urine procurement process. While the accused initially queried why his urine samples which were obtained on 16 February 2018, a Friday, in the early hours were only sent to HSA for analysis on the 19 February 2018, a Monday, this was easily explained by the fact that 16 February 2018 was a Public Holiday (Chinese New Year). The witnesses, including from the HSA, have confirmed that the HSA does not operate on public holidays and on weekends. The fact that the urine samples were sent on 19 February 2018, the first available working day, was therefore reasonable and nothing much turned on this fact.

19     Section 31(4) (b) of the MDA had been complied with and by virtue of the 2 certificates the presumption under section 22 of the MDA is triggered that the accused had consumed the said drug knowingly. It is undisputed that the accused was not authorised under the MDA or its regulations to consume methamphetamine.

20     The 2 analysts from HSA, Ms Kwok and Ms Chan testified that the consumption of methamphetamine would give rise to the presence of methamphetamine in the urine sample. The accused is therefore presumed to have consumed the methamphetamine. In the case of _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v Public Prosecutor_ \[2011\] 4 SLR 802 the Court of Appeal held that both the actus reus and mens rea of section 8(b) of the MDA were presumed by section 22 of the MDA. The burden then shifted to the accused to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities

21     The only issue therefore for determination was whether he had rebutted this presumption and this would involve an examination of his defence. In the course of investigation, the accused had raised the medication defence. Acting on the claim of the accused, SSSgt Elfi had obtained a list of the medication prescribed to the accused by TTSH and the polyclinic, P4 and P5. However, it was the unchallenged evidence of both HSA analysts that these medications would not give rise to the presence of Methamphetamine in his urine sample.

22     When he gave his defence, the accused chose to wisely abandon the medication defence in the light of the evidence from the HSA analysts. He then raised what is commonly described as the spiking defence. He claimed that the drink which he took, banana flavoured milk, had been spiked by his friend, one Nasir, a male Malay, aged between 50 to 52, who lives at the 2nd floor of Blk 168 Bukit Batok West Avenue. He described Nasir as a drug supervisee at Jurong Police Division. He felt that the spiking of the drink caused him to black out and this gave rise to the presence of methamphetamine in his urine samples.

23     There were great difficulties in believing the spiking defence of the accused. Firstly, it bears emphasis to state that the burden was on the accused to prove his defence, especially since such allegations are easy to make. This would mean that at the very least he should produce the alleged spiker. This was obviously not done in this case.

24     The accused appeared to have taken the stand that the investigating officer must do his very best and more to locate Nasir for him, which clearly the investigating officer was not obliged to do. Nevertheless, to the credit of SSgt Vinod he did all he could to try within reason, and he in fact extensively investigated into the accused’s defence to ascertain whether Nasir exists. With whatever details he could obtain from the accused, who does not even seem to know Nasir’s exact name, he did the necessary screening which included checking personally with the owner of the unit, one Isa Bin M Ahmad, who does not know of any “Nasir” staying in his flat since 2014. When the accused claimed that Nasir was a drug supervisee with Jurong, SSgt Vinod, using all the permutations possible in the spelling of Nasir’s name tried to trace him but the searches drew a blank. Since the alleged spiker was absent, it would be highly speculative for the accused to claim that the spiker’s evidence would have corroborated the accused’s evidence. _(_At paragraph 21 _of Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ \[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839).

25     Further, it is incredible as to how a glass can be spiked as the accused admitted that he did not check the glass before pouring the milk into it and he could not say with any certainty that it was not empty. He had also agreed when cross-examined that when he drank the banana flavoured milk it came from a packet that was sealed and it was a new packet. In any event, if there was a Nasir whom the accused said he had known, including his family for more than 3 decades, there does not seem any reason why this family friend would want to spike his drink. I am aware that the accused claimed that it was because Nasir wanted to steal from him but then this was something that could not be proven one way or the other.

26     Under these circumstances, I find that the accused has failed to rebut the presumption triggered by sections 16 and 22 of the MDA that he had consumed the methamphetamine knowingly, on a balance of probabilities on the material date and time. His allegation of his drink being spiked remained just that, a mere allegation which was barely adequate to rebut the presumption. Therefore, I was more than satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused and found him guilty and convicted him on the charge.

## Conclusion

27     Upon his conviction, the prosecution disclosed that the accused had a criminal history which began in 1989 and only his drug antecedents are reproduced as follows:

28     In addition, the accused had a DRC admission in 1992 and was subjected to 5 Drug Supervision Orders with the latest being in February 2017.

29     The prescribed punishment for an LT2 offence is 7 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane and the maximum is 13 years’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. The prosecution, in its address on sentence, submitted for a sentence of at least 8 years’ imprisonment. The accused had nothing to say in mitigation except to say that he would appeal.

30     In determining the appropriate sentence for this offence I was not minded to impose the mandatory minimum term of 7 years’ imprisonment for a number of reasons. First and foremost, this was the second time that the accused has been convicted of an LT2 offence. His first was as recent as 2013 and he was released in February 2017. He committed the current offence within a year of his release. Secondly, he was first produced in court on 8 November 2017 in respect of offences under the Penal Code and was released on court bail on the 16 of November 2017. While on court bail, he committed the current offence of consumption of a specified drug, an LT2 on 15 February 2018 and 6 other offences under the MDA. This is undoubtedly an aggravating factor. (See PP _v Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ \[2007\] 4 SLR 753 and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ \[2015\] SGHC 217). As stated in the cases mentioned, it demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention.

31     The accused had also chosen to claim trial for this offence and while he is not penalised for having decided to claim trial, he is certainly not entitled to any discount in sentence usually afforded to persons who plead guilty at the first available opportunity. Clearly, there was no remorse on his part. Secondly, while the trial was not protracted, the prosecution had to call 8 witnesses, including 2 HSA analysts for the trial.

32     While I was of the view that the prosecution’s position on sentence was rather measured, exercising some leniency towards the accused, I sentenced him to serve 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonments with 6 strokes of the cane. 6 months above the mandatory minimum can hardly be considered as excessive or crushing, given that the accused is a repeat LT2 offender and he cannot expect the same sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment that was meted out in 2013. The accused chose to claim trial for the remaining 8 charges which comprised 2 charges under the Penal Code and 6 under the MDA. For these matters, they were fixed for a pre-trial conference for trial dates to be fixed.

33     The accused is currently serving his sentence, which I backdated to the 7 May 2018, as he had been in remand since this date.
