### District Judge Koo Zhi Xuan:

## Introduction

1       Daniyal Bin Mohamed Jalil (“the Accused”), also known as “Thosei”, claimed trial to a single charge (DAC-921364-2019) of abetting by intentionally aiding the trafficking of methamphetamine, an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) (“the Trafficking Charge”). The Trafficking Charge states as follows:

>     … you, on 22 January 2019, at or around 5pm in Singapore, did abet by intentionally aiding Rahiman Bin Mohamad (“**Rahiman**”) to traffic in a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”), to wit, you arranged for Rahiman to deliver the said drug to one Muhammad Hairul Bin Mohd Yassin, and in consequence of your abetment on 22 January 2019 at or around 6 pm in the vicinity of Block 602, Jurong West Street 62, Singapore 640602, Rahiman had in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, one packet (1) containing not less than 0.48 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.32 gram of methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) read with Section 12 of the MDA, punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act.

2       On 3 August 2021, I convicted the Accused on the Trafficking Charge. On 26 August 2021, the Accused _pleaded guilty_ to two other charges (DAC-900127-2020 and DAC-900129-2020) under the Computer Misuse Act (Cap 50A, Rev Ed 2007) which had earlier been stood down, with two other related charges (DAC-900128-2020 and DAC-900130-2020) taken into consideration (“TIC”). He was sentenced to a global imprisonment sentence of 5 years’, 8 months’ and 2 weeks’ imprisonment, and 5 strokes of the cane. The breakdown of the sentences is as follows:

3       Subsequently, the Accused filed a Notice of Appeal only against _conviction_. These grounds of decision are thus confined to my reasons for convicting the Accused for the Trafficking Charge. They supersede the oral judgment which I had delivered in court on 3 August 2021.

## The Factual Background

### The undisputed facts

4       At the start of the trial, a Statement of Agreed Facts (“P1”) signed off by both the Deputy Public Prosecutor and the Defence Counsel representing the Accused at the trial was tendered by the Prosecution and admitted under section 267 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”).

5       The undisputed facts are as follows:

> (a)     On 22 January 2019, at or about 6.36 pm, at the vicinity of Block 602, Jurong West Street 62 (“the identified location”), Rahiman Bin Mohamad (“Rahiman”) was arrested by a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers with two packets of crystalline substance, one weighing not less than 0.56 gram (“the 1st Packet”), and the other weighing not less than 0.48 gram (“the 2nd Packet”). The Health Sciences Authority reported, upon analysis, that the 1st Packet was found to contain not less than 0.37 gram of methamphetamine; while the 2nd Packet was found to contain not less than 0.32 gram of methamphetamine. The chain of custody for the 1st Packet and the 2nd Packet was unbroken.

> (b)     On 22 January 2019, there were calls (including missed ones) and text messages exchanged between the mobile phone of Muhammad Hairul Bin Mohd Yassin (“Hairul”) and the Accused’s mobile phone from approximately 4.42 pm to 6.34 pm.

> (c)     On 22 January 2019, there were calls (including missed ones) exchanged between the mobile phone of Rahiman and the Accused’s mobile phone from approximately 4.58 pm to 6.46 pm.

> (d)     Three s 22 CPC statements were recorded from the Accused, and they were accurately given by the Accused voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise:

>> (i)       The statement recorded on 24 January 2019 at 9.20 pm (“P8”) by Station Inspector Ranjeet S/O Ram Behari;

>> (ii)       The statement recorded on 25 January 2019 at 3.15 pm (“P9”) by Inspector Fernandez Anthony Leo (“PW8”); and

>> (iii)       The statement recorded on 22 March 2019 at 11.55 am (“P10”) by PW8.

### The Prosecution’s case

6       The Prosecution’s case was that on 22 January 2019, Hairul had, in the presence and under the instruction of CNB officers, used his mobile phone to call the Accused’s mobile phone to make a purchase of 0.5 gram of methamphetamine. The Accused then used his mobile phone to call Rahiman’s mobile phone to arrange for Rahiman to deliver 0.5 gram of methamphetamine to Hairul at the identified location. The Accused further communicated separately with both Hairul and Rahiman through text messages and calls, until Rahiman was arrested with the 2nd Packet (containing 0.48 gram of methamphetamine, henceforth referred to as the “said drug”) in his possession which was for the purpose of trafficking at the identified location. In short, the Prosecution’s case was that the Accused had _abetted_ the trafficking of the said drug by playing the role of a middleman between Hairul (the intended buyer of the said drug) and Rahiman (the intended seller of the said drug, who had in his possession the said drug for the purpose of trafficking).

7       The Prosecution called the following key witnesses during the trial:

> (a)     Hairul, who was also known as “Awul”. He was the ex-colleague of the Accused.

> (b)     Staff Sergeant Muhammad Nuur Bin Rahmat (“PW2”). PW2 testified that he was the CNB officer who had instructed Hairul to call and message the Accused on 22 January 2019.

> (c)     Rahiman, who was acquainted with the Accused since their secondary school days. He was arrested on 22 January 2019 at the identified location for being in possession of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking. Sometime later in 2019, he was convicted and sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane for an offence under the MDA.

> (d)     PW8, who had recorded the statements of Rahiman on 23 January 2019, and the statements of the Accused subsequently (see above at \[5(d)\]).

> (e)     Officer Muhammad Hafiz Bin Reduan (“PW9”). PW9 testified that he was the other CNB officer who was present when Hairul was calling and messaging the Accused on 22 January 2019.

8       The key exhibits which were tendered by the Prosecution and formally admitted during the trial are as follows:

### The Defence’s case

9       The Defence’s case was one of denial. The Accused denied having spoken or communicated with Hairul at the material time on 22 January 2019. While the Accused did not deny being in contact with Rahiman at the material time on 22 January 2019, the Defence’s case was that the conversations between Rahiman and the Accused at the material time did not relate to the trafficking of the said drug.

10     The Accused elected to give evidence at the trial. The Defence did not call any other witness or tender any exhibit.

## The Law of Abetment by Intentionally Aiding

11     The Trafficking Charge against the Accused is one of abetment by intentionally aiding Rahiman to traffic in the said drug. In order to be found guilty of having abetted by intentionally aiding the offence committed by Rahiman, the Accused must have done something which facilitated the commission of the offence and he must have done so with the knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence (_Public Prosecutor v Koh Peng Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 753</span> at \[24\]).

12     In the context of intentionally aiding the commission of drug trafficking, the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Azli bin Mohammad Salleh v Public Prosecutor and another appeal and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 1374</span> at \[46\] has held that:

>     knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence requires knowledge: (a) that the primary offender had possession of the thing which turns out to be the drug (“the element of possession”); (b) of the nature of the drug in the primary offender’s possession (“the element of knowledge”); and (c) that the primary offender intended to traffic in the drug.

13     Therefore, in order to make out an offence of abetment by intentionally aiding the trafficking of the said drug, the Prosecution bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that, on 22 January 2019:

> (a)     Rahiman was at the material time in possession of the said drug for the purpose of trafficking;

> (b)     The Accused knew that Rahiman was in possession of the said drug, and that Rahiman had done so for the purpose of trafficking; and

> (c)     The Accused had intentionally and knowingly done an act that facilitated Rahiman being in possession of the said drug for the purpose of trafficking.

14     If the Prosecution could prove the aforementioned elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, the Accused would be, by virtue of section 12 of the MDA, guilty of the offence of trafficking the said drug under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the MDA, and shall be liable on conviction to the punishment provided for that offence.

## Issues before the Court

15     In the present case, it was not disputed that Rahiman was in possession of the said drug for the purpose of trafficking when he was arrested at the identified location, an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the MDA. The only points of dispute between the Prosecution and the Defence relate to whether the Accused _knew_ that Rahiman was in possession of the said drug for the purpose of trafficking; and whether he had _intentionally and knowingly arranged_ for Rahiman to be in possession of the said drug for the purpose of trafficking at the identified location.

16     The two factual issues before the Court that would determine if the Accused was indeed guilty of the Trafficking Charge were as follows:

> (a)     Did Hairul, on 22 January 2019, at about 4:42 pm to 6:34 pm, contact the Accused to purchase the said drug and communicate with the Accused on where the said drug would be delivered to him (“Issue 1”)?

> (b)     Did the Accused, on 22 January 2019, at about 4:58 pm to 6.32 pm, contact and communicate with Rahiman to arrange for the latter to deliver the said drug to Hairul at the identified location (“Issue 2”)?

## Issue 1: Whether Hairul had contacted the Accused to purchase the said drug and communicated with the Accused on where the said drug would be delivered to him

17     On Issue 1, the Prosecution’s witnesses (Hairul, PW2 and PW9) testified at the trial that Hairul had contacted the Accused to purchase the said drug, and had communicated with the Accused on where the said drug would be delivered to him thereafter. The Defence, on the other hand, denied that the Accused had any involvement at all in all of the alleged exchange of communications found between the mobile phones of Hairul and the Accused.

### The credible and cogent testimonies provided by Hairul, PW2 and PW9 of the communications between Hairul and the Accused

18     Hairul testified at the trial that:

> (a)     He was at the Jurong Police Division Headquarters (“Jurong Police HQ”) on 22 January 2019 when he was instructed by CNB officers to make a call at approximately 4:41 pm to the Accused’s mobile phone to purchase drugs.[^1]

> (b)     He was able to recognise the Accused’s voice when speaking with the Accused over the phone.[^2]

> (c)     In his first phone call with the Accused, he ordered 0.5 gram of “Ice” (another word for methamphetamine) from the Accused.[^3]

> (d)     After that phone call, he then exchanged text messages with the Accused to update the Accused of his supposed location,[^4] through the following text messages which have been translated, admitted and exhibited as P15 (without any objection from the Defence):

> (e)     He understood the text message “Member \[or Friend\] looking for you” sent by the Accused at 6.29 pm to mean that the Accused’s “friend” was looking for him.[^5]

19     The cross-examination of Hairul by Defence Counsel did not reveal any weakness in Hairul’s testimony. I found Hairul to be a generally reliable witness whose testimony I accept. No reason was put forth by the Defence Counsel or the Accused as to why I should doubt Hairul’s testimony. Hairul’s testimony was also corroborated by the testimonies of PW2 and PW9.

20     PW2 testified at the trial that:

> (a)     On 22 January 2019, at the Jurong Police HQ, Hairul informed PW2 that he was willing to cooperate with CNB to assist the CNB in identifying the Accused who had supplied “Ice” to Hairul.[^6]

> (b)     He instructed Hairul to communicate “as per normal” with the Accused to purchase “Ice”.[^7]

> (c)     In a room within the Jurong Police HQ, Hairul called the Accused and spoke to the latter. Hairul also typed the messages on his mobile phone and showed PW2 before sending the text messages (set out at \[18(d)\] above) to the Accused.[^8]

> (d)     Hairul’s mobile phone was connected to a loudspeaker when he was calling and speaking with the Accused.[^9]

> (e)     PW2 was able to understand what was said between Hairul and the Accused during the phone calls.[^10] PW2 recalled that Hairul made a call to the Accused, where the Accused had asked “you want?” and Hairul then replied “Yes, normal P5”. [^11]

21     PW2 also documented the alleged oral phone conversations between Hairul and the Accused a few hours later on 22 January 2019. This document was admitted and exhibited in the trial as P11. The timings of the calls and text messages stated within P11 are largely consistent with the records found in P4 (the Starhub toll records for the Accused’s mobile phone). The contents of P11 set out the following:

> (a)     Hairul first called the Accused at approximately 4:41 pm, where Hairul allegedly told the Accused that he wanted “normal P5”. The Accused then allegedly told Hairul that he would “get back to \[Hairul\] in 5 minutes time.”

> (b)     Hairul then exchanged text messages with the Accused which have been set out at \[18(d)\] above. Hairul next called the Accused at approximately 6:34 pm, and the following conversation allegedly took place orally:

>> Accused: Where?

>> Hairul: I am in the clinic.

>> Accused: Which clinic?

>> Hairul: At block 601.

>> Accused: That clinic no longer open. I thought is already closed.

>> Hairul: No lah. I am in the clinic.

>> Accused: Ok. I coming over.

22     PW9 testified at the trial that:

> (a)     He was in the same room as Hairul and PW2 when Hairul made the calls and exchanged text messages with the Accused.[^12]

> (b)     Hairul had communicated with the Accused to set up the location for a “drug … buy”.[^13]

> (c)     PW2 had shown him P11 on the day of Hairul’s arrest, to confirm the accuracy of its contents.[^14]

23     The Defence did not put forth any reason or suggestion why Hairul, PW2 or PW9 would concoct a lie about Hairul contacting the Accused to purchase methamphetamine. Faced with these three largely consistent and corroborative testimonies, the Defence sought only to cast doubt on the accuracy of P11, given that the contents of the two phone calls between Hairul and the Accused were not recorded _contemporaneously_.

24     According to PW2, P11 was only documented in its present form “at about 11:30pm” on 22 January 2019 (_ie_, a few hours after the calls were made), based on his recollection of the calls between Hairul and the Accused and the text messages sent and received by Hairul’s phone.[^15] PW2 testified that he had orally checked with PW9 approximately an hour after the calls were made to confirm his recollection of the contents of the communications between Hairul and the Accused.[^16] PW9, on the other hand, testified that P11 was shown to him on 22 January 2019 by PW2 and he had confirmed its contents on the spot.[^17]

25     While there appeared to be some inconsistencies between the testimonies of PW2 and PW9 on whether P11 (or an earlier draft) was in fact shown to PW9, and P11 appeared to have been produced a few hours after the communications between Hairul and the Accused had taken place, I found no reason to doubt the veracity of the contents reflected in P11 for the following reasons.

> (a)     First, PW2 had explained that he did not take contemporaneous notes because the oral conversations between Hairul and the Accused lasted only for a few seconds.[^18] I found this explanation to be a credible one, given that P4, the Accused’s Starhub phone records, show that the first phone conversation between the Accused and Hairul lasted for 48 seconds, while the second phone conversation lasted only 37 seconds.

> (b)     Second, Hairul’s testimony at the trial largely corroborated the contents of P11, even though he was the first Prosecution witness and he did not have sight of P11 when he was giving his testimony on the stand.

> (c)     Third, the alleged contents of the oral conversations reflected in P11 are logically and chronologically consistent with the text messages that were exchanged in between these calls. In the first phone conversation, Hairul had allegedly sought to purchase 0.5 gram of methamphetamine from the Accused with the Accused telling him that he would “get back” to Hairul later. Subsequent to this phone call, the Accused texted Hairul to “update” when the latter had reached “602” (a reference to the identified location). After Hairul texted the Accused that he was at the clinic, the Accused then texted Hairul to be at “602” and to call the Accused. Two minutes later, Hairul then called and spoke with the Accused, and this second phone conversation allegedly centred around Hairul being at the clinic at “Block 601” and the Accused mentioning that he was coming over.

> (d)     Fourth, throughout the entire trial, the Defence provided no alternative, credible account of what these two phone conversations between the Accused and Hairul were about, if what was reflected in P11 was indeed inaccurate.

26     All in all, I had no reason to doubt that the testimonies of Hairul, PW2 and PW9 were credible and cogent; and that P11 could be relied on as a record of the phone conversations between Hairul and the Accused at the material time. These evidence, together with the undeniable text messages exchanged between Hairul’s mobile phone and the Accused’s mobile phone as set out in P15, established that Hairul did in fact use his mobile phone at the material time to contact and communicate with the Accused to purchase 0.5 gram of methamphetamine, on the instruction of PW2. I shall now explain why the Defence failed to raise any reasonable doubt on my findings under Issue 1.

### The Defence failed to raise a reasonable doubt against the Prosecution’s case that Hairul had contacted and communicated with the Accused to purchase the said drug

27     The fundamental thrust of the Accused’s defence on Issue 1 was to deny that the Accused had any communication with Hairul at all at the material time on 22 January 2019. Two different lines of defences, which appear to be mutually contradictory, were proffered during the trial.

28     The first line of defence is what I have termed the “Food Delivery Defence”. This was first alluded to in Defence Counsel’s cross-examination of Hairul,[^19] and subsequently repeated in the Defence Counsel’s written submissions.[^20] The defence asserted here is that any communication between Hairul and the Accused at the material time was in relation to “Foodpanda” deliveries, not drugs.

29     The second line of defence is what I have termed the “Neighbourhood Friend Defence”. In his statements to the police, and during the trial, the Accused attributed the communications with Hairul found on his phone records at the material time to a “Malay guy” whom he trusted as a “neighbourhood friend”,[^21] who he “usually play\[s\] soccer with”.[^22] According to the “Neighbourhood Friend Defence”, it was this “neighbourhood friend” of the Accused who had spoken with and texted Hairul at the material time after he had borrowed and used the Accused’s mobile phone twice.

#### Reasons why the “Food Delivery Defence” must fail

30     Far from challenging the Prosecution’s case, the “Food Delivery Defence” is a defence which could not even stand on its own legs. This is for the simple reason that the claim that the calls between Hairul and the Accused were in relation to “Foodpanda” deliveries did _not_ come from any of the witnesses’ testimonies at the trial. In fact, the Accused’s only testimony in relation to this defence was that he could not remember whether he had instructed his Defence Counsel that the communications between Hairul and himself were related to “Foodpanda” deliveries.[^23] On the other hand, the Accused’s consistent testimony in court was that he “didn’t have any contact with Hairul” at the material time;[^24] and that it was his “neighbourhood friend” who was responsible for the communications with Hairul on 22 January 2019.[^25]

31     Defence Counsel was given the opportunity to re-examine the Accused, but no clarification was sought on the “Food Delivery Defence”. As such, there was simply _no basis_ for Defence Counsel to be even making this claim in his written submissions. There was _no evidence at all_ supporting the Defence’s submission that the “calls on 22 January 2019 in the afternoon were for Food Panda deliveries”.[^26]

#### Reasons why the “Neighbourhood Friend Defence” must fail

32     Although the Accused had made reference to the “Neighbourhood Friend Defence” in his statement as early as 24 Jan 2019,[^27] just two days after the incident, the Accused was either unable or unwilling to provide the police or the Court with the name or contact details of this alleged friend of his. This “neighbourhood friend” was therefore not called as a witness in the trial. This was despite the fact that the Accused agreed, at the trial, that he “knew \[this friend\] for some time” and “knew him well enough that \[he\] trusted \[this friend, even allowing\] him to walk away with \[his\] phone”.[^28] It is telling that despite this supposed close relationship between the Accused and the “neighbourhood friend”, the Accused could not even provide the name or the nickname of this alleged friend of his.

33     The Accused had consistently maintained under oath in court that this “neighbourhood friend” had borrowed his mobile phone _twice_ at the material time.[^29] The Accused also claimed that the “neighbourhood friend” had:[^30]

>     … only made one or two phonecalls. It was for about 5 to 10 mins estimated. The rest of the time of the day, my handphone was with me and only I used the phone.

34     Without any evidence supporting the Accused’s claim that the person whom Hairul had communicated with was the “neighbourhood friend”, I found the Defence’s attempt to attribute the two calls and multiple text messages exchanged between Hairul’s mobile phone and the Accused’s mobile phone to the “neighbourhood friend” to be wholly untenable.

35     First, the Accused’s phone records (P4) clearly show that it was Hairul who had _initiated communications_ with the Accused at 4:42 pm on 22 January 2019 by calling the Accused’s mobile phone. No explanation was proffered by the Defence as to why Hairul would be contacting this unknown “neighbourhood friend” to purchase the said drug by calling the Accused’s phone number. The allegation that Hairul was speaking with and texting the “neighbourhood friend” instead of the Accused was not even brought up to Hairul when Defence Counsel was cross-examining Hairul. Hairul had in turn testified that he recognized the Accused’s voice when he first called the Accused, and this claim of Hairul’s was not successfully challenged. During the Accused’s cross-examination, the Accused also agreed with the Prosecution that if “Hairul \[had\] wanted to reach out to this neighbourhood guy, he would not be dialling \[the Accused’s\] number”.[^31] There was therefore _no logical basis_ at all for the Court to even suppose that Hairul might have been communicating with the “neighbourhood friend” instead during the material time.

36     Second, even if it is assumed against the grain of evidence, for the benefit of the Accused, that this “neighbourhood friend” happened to be in possession of the Accused’s mobile phone when Hairul made the call at approximately 4.42 pm, this defence must still fail because it contradicts the Accused’s own testimony that the “neighbourhood friend” had only borrowed his phone twice. The Defence simply could not account for the number of exchanges made between Hairul’s and the Accused’s mobile phones.

37     During the trial, the Accused testified that he was the one who had spoken to Rahiman for the calls exchanged between 4.58 pm to 6.32 pm.[^32]_In this same period_, text messages were exchanged between Hairul’s and the Accused’s mobile phones _multiple times_, which the Accused denied having any involvement in or knowledge of. Given the Accused’s testimony, the number of times in which the “neighbourhood friend” would have to physically borrow or retrieve the Accused’s mobile phone from the Accused is a fact which could be objectively determined, based on the Accused’s very own phone records in P4, as follows:

38     The table above clearly shows that for the “Neighbourhood Friend Defence” to succeed, this “neighbourhood friend” must have borrowed the Accused’s phone **_on at least 4 separate occasions_** on 22 January 2019 (_ie_, prior to 4:42 pm, prior to 4:59 pm, 6:29 pm, and prior to 6:34 pm). This contradicts the Accused’s consistent testimony in court that the “neighbourhood friend” had only borrowed his mobile phone _twice_. Moreover, the _length of time_ the “neighbourhood friend” must have had possession of the Accused’s mobile phone (_ie_, between 4:59 pm to 6:22 pm) also contradicts the Accused’s claim that the “neighbourhood friend” had borrowed his phone for “about 5 to 10 mins estimated” (see above at \[33\]).

39     Not only is this defence internally contradictory, the factual account necessitated by the acceptance of this defence is also an incredible one. If the “Neighbourhood Friend Defence” was true, it would mean that while the “neighbourhood friend” was allegedly using the Accused’s mobile phone to text and speak with Hairul on where Hairul should meet Rahiman for the delivery of the said drug, which the Accused was supposedly oblivious to, the Accused was simultaneously also using his mobile phone (which he would have to retrieve from the “neighbourhood friend” multiple times) just to “chitchat” with Rahiman.[^33] The Defence provided _no explanation_ whatsoever as to how and why the Court could accept such an incredible account.

40     Far from casting any doubt on the Prosecution’s case, the Defence’s reliance on these hopeless lines of defence has only ended up _damaging the Accused’s credibility and fortifying the Prosecution’s case_. The Accused has shown that he has simply no believable explanation or valid defence to account for the recorded communications between Hairul and himself as reflected in P11, and was desperately grasping at straws in order to distance himself from his communications with Hairul. In my judgment, the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses, the recorded communications in P11, and the contents of the text messages exchanged between Hairul and the Accused all established beyond a reasonable doubt that Hairul had, at the material time, contacted the Accused to purchase the said drug and exchanged communications with the Accused on where the said drug would be delivered to him.

## Issue 2: Whether the Accused had contacted and communicated with Rahiman to arrange for Rahiman to deliver the said drug to Hairul at the identified location

41     To establish the elements which the Prosecution has to prove under Issue 2, Rahiman was called by the Prosecution as a witness, as Rahiman and the Accused had only exchanged phone calls, which did not appear to have been witnessed or overheard by anyone else. Rahiman testified that at the material time on 22 January 2019, he was in possession of the 1st Packet and the 2nd Packet (which contained methamphetamine, see above at \[5(a)\]) which he had intended to sell.[^34] Rahiman also testified that one of the customers he was going to sell methamphetamine to was the man whose photograph was shown in P22,[^35] who had been identified by PW2 and PW9 as a photograph of Hairul.[^36]

42     When Rahiman was asked to account for the four phone calls exchanged between the Accused and himself at the material time, Rahiman’s testimony in court was that the phone calls were made simply for Rahiman and the Accused to “irritate” each other.[^37] At this juncture, the Prosecution applied to cross-examine Rahiman under s 156 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”) with the goal of impeaching his credit under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act. According to the Prosecution, Rahiman’s credit should be impeached because the evidence he had given in court in relation to the purpose and contents of the four phone calls with the Accused was materially inconsistent with the former statements that were previously recorded from him.

43     I therefore informed parties that I would be applying the “three-step” impeachment procedure set out in _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> (“_Peter Kwang_”) at \[21\]:

> (a)     First, I would have to read the former statements of Rahiman which the Prosecution had alleged were materially inconsistent with his testimony in Court.

> (b)     Second, if I agreed with the Prosecution that there were serious discrepancies or material contradictions between the former statements and Rahiman’s testimony in Court, Rahiman was to be asked if these statements were in fact given by him.

> (c)     Third, if Rahiman admitted that he had given the former statements, he would then have to be afforded a fair and full opportunity to explain the differences in the discrepant or contradictory accounts.

44     Parties were in agreement with the procedure set out above. The Prosecution then duly tendered two redacted statements of Rahiman recorded by PW8 on 23 January 2019 (a day after Rahiman was arrested at the identified location) for the Court’s consideration.

45     The first former statement of Rahiman (subsequently admitted and marked as “P23”) was recorded on 23 January 2019 at 2:25 pm and it was alleged to have contained the material inconsistencies underlined in red:

![]([2021] SGDC 0229_Image/[2021] SGDC 0229_image1.png)

46     In addition, the final page of P23 also contained the same photograph exhibited in P22. On that page, the following words (which Rahiman had signed off) were found at the side of the photograph: “I have passed “ice” to this man before. He is Customer A.”

47     The second former statement of Rahiman (subsequently admitted and marked as “P24”) was recorded on 23 January 2019 at 10:40 pm and it was alleged to have contained the material inconsistencies underlined in red:

![]([2021] SGDC 0229_Image/[2021] SGDC 0229_image2.png)

48     I agreed with the Prosecution, upon reading these portions of P23 and P24, that Rahiman’s account of the purpose and contents of the phone calls with the Accused at the material time was _materially inconsistent_ with his oral testimony in court that the phone calls were simply for the purpose of “irritating” each other. I therefore proceeded to ask Rahiman in court whether: (a) P23 and P24 were his statements; (b) the signature on these statements were his; and (c) the statements were given by him voluntarily. Upon Rahiman’s confirmation of all of the above, I admitted and marked the statements as P23 and P24 accordingly.[^38]

49     The Prosecution and Defence Counsel then proceeded in turn to question Rahiman, for Rahiman to explain the differences in the material inconsistencies found between his testimony in court and the contents underlined in P23 and P24. In gist, Rahiman’s explanation of the inconsistencies was that he had uttered “nonsense” to PW8 during the statement recording process.[^39] As to why he was uttering “nonsense”, Rahiman first claimed that he was not “in \[his\] right state of mind \[as he\] was very depressed” after he was arrested,[^40] before explaining much later that he was depressed and “very down” as he was still “under the influence of \[methamphetamine\]”.[^41] Rahiman then claimed when questioned by Defence Counsel that he was feeling “high plus depressed” when his statements were recorded on 23 January 2019.[^42]

50     At the end of the impeachment proceedings, the Prosecution sought to impeach Rahiman’s credit under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act, and for his testimony in court on the purpose and contents of his phone calls with the Accused to be substituted with the relevant contents of P23 and P24 by virtue of s 147(3) of the Evidence Act. As I had reserved my ruling on whether Rahiman’s credit has been impeached during the proceedings, I shall now set out the reasons why I had agreed with the Prosecution on the impeachment of Rahiman.

### Reasons why Rahiman’s credit was impeached

51     The High Court has explained that the purpose of impeaching a witness’s credit is to “undermine the witness’ credibility by showing that his testimony in court should not be believed because he was of such a character and moral make-up that he is one who is incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath and should not be relied on” (_Peter Kwang_ at \[19\]). A witness can be impeached if the “discrepancies were sufficiently material to call into question the \[witness’\] credit” and if his explanations for the discrepancies were “not credible” (_Peter Kwang_ at \[26\]).

52     In my judgment, Rahiman’s explanation of the material inconsistencies between his testimony in court and his previous statements (P23 and P24) was _completely unconvincing_, and his oral testimony in court demonstrated that he was an unreliable witness who was “incapable of speaking the whole truth under oath” in relation to the purpose and contents of the phone calls with the Accused at the material time. My reasons for coming to this conclusion are set out as follows.

53     First, despite having been given time to read through P23 and P24, Rahiman was _very quick_ in court to claim that all the parts in his statements which inculpated the Accused were, in his words, “nonsense” and that “everything in \[his\] statement is nonsense”.[^43] But when confronted with the many factually accurate claims in his statements pertaining to information about his personal background and family members, he backtracked from his claim that “everything is nonsense”, and claimed that parts of his statement relating to himself were accurately given.[^44] When he was then asked if all the amendments which he made in his statements were “nonsense”, he once again offered the _categorical answer_ that everything – that is, all of his amendments – was “nonsense”.[^45] However, he very quickly had to backtrack again, when confronted with amendments he had made in P23 about his family members, which he claimed was not “nonsense”.[^46] All in all, Rahiman came across as a witness who was very cavalier about the truth or accuracy of the testimony he was giving in court, especially in relation to portions in his statements which inculpated the Accused.

54     Second, Rahiman did not offer a convincing account as to why he would be exchanging multiple calls with the Accused at the material period. It bears mentioning that Rahiman had initially claimed in court that he could not remember who he had been in contact with at the material time other than his customers.[^47] However, pictures taken of Rahiman’s phone (P5) together with P4 show that there were in fact _seven phone calls_ made by Rahiman or the Accused to each other at the material time, three of which Rahiman had rejected or missed (likely due to the fact that Rahiman had at those points already been confronted or arrested by CNB officers). Rahiman did not deny that he was, at the material time, in possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking to two different customers. Why would he, in the actual heat of a drug trafficking attempt, be speaking with the Accused _multiple times in the space of 9 minutes_ (from approximately 6:23 pm to 6:32 pm) just to, in his words, “irritate” each other? When this account is compared with the factually detailed account provided in Rahiman’s statements as to the purpose and contents of these calls, it is evidently clear that the latter account is a far more convincing one which fits with the surrounding facts.

55     Third, Rahiman’s claim that he was uttering nonsense in his statements because he was still under the influence of drugs or was depressed when his statements were taken were just bare, unsupported assertions on his part. I saw no reason to accept Rahiman’s belated claim, especially after I considered the following:

> (a)     Rahiman had made _numerous amendments_ to both his statements, which revealed that at the material time when his statements were taken on 23 January 2019, he was sufficiently alert enough to point out what he felt were mistakes, which he would then instruct PW8, the recording officer, to correct. As the Prosecution correctly pointed out, many of these were amendments made to downplay his involvement in the drug trafficking attempts he was confessing to. For example, he was conscientiously replacing the word “sell” to “pass” or “get” in his statements,[^48] when describing the movement of drugs which he was involved in. PW8 had testified that these were amendments which were proposed by Rahiman himself.[^49] This suggests that Rahiman was clearly in the right frame of mind to highlight in his statements that he was merely carrying out instructions to “pass” drugs to others, and was not the primary supplier or seller of drugs. Such level of cognitive awareness displayed throughout the amendments made in Rahiman’s statements – all of which he had countersigned – stood in clear contrast to Rahiman’s belated and unsupported assertion that he was simply uttering “nonsense”, even with regards to the amendments he had proposed to be made.[^50]

> (b)     PW8 provided a cogent and convincing testimony in court that on 23 January 2019 when the statements were taken, Rahiman was able to converse with him, give details and answer clarifications clearly when required.[^51] He testified that Rahiman “seemed normal” to him,[^52] and that if any witness appeared to be medically unfit, he would have obtained medical attention for the witness before proceeding with the statement recording.[^53] There was therefore no reason for PW8 to believe that Rahiman was unable to speak the truth at the material time, especially since the statement recording process on 23 January 2019 with Rahiman had taken place “over a period of time \[and\] at no point of time did \[PW8\] feel that there was anything amiss to \[Rahiman’s\] demeanour”.[^54] PW8’s testimony on this point was not successfully challenged by Defence Counsel during cross-examination.

56     Fourth, and most critically, Rahiman’s account of the phone conversations in his statements was _remarkably consistent with all the other external evidence_. When one puts together the text messages exchanged between Hairul and the Accused in P15, the contents of the phone conversations between Hairul and the Accused set out in P11, and the contents of the phone conversations between Rahiman and the Accused set out by Rahiman in P23, what is revealed is a seamless, logically compelling account of all of the steps taken by the Accused in _knowingly facilitating_ the trafficking of the said drug:

57     Viewed in context, Rahiman’s belated claim that his account of the phone conversations between the Accused and himself which he had provided in P23 was simply “nonsense” uttered due to the influence of drugs is simply unsustainable. Whatever his mental state might be at the time he was giving his statements, the fact remains that Rahiman’s account in P23 as to the purpose and contents of the phone calls he had with the Accused on 22 January 2019 _gelled compellingly_ with the rest of the evidence _that would have been outside Rahiman’s knowledge or control_. The irresistible inference must be that Rahiman was in fact telling the truth about the purpose and contents of the calls he had exchanged with the Accused in his statements.

58     Having considered all of the above, I was of the view that the Prosecution had successfully impeached Rahiman’s credit under s 157(_c_) of the Evidence Act, as Rahiman’s explanation on what he had said in P23 and P24 was simply not credible. In addition, I agreed with the Prosecution that the best explanation as to why Rahiman’s testimony in court was materially inconsistent with P23 and P24 was that Rahiman had decided to lie in court in order to protect the Accused,[^55] as the Accused and Rahiman were “good friends”, and the Accused was also “quite close to \[Rahiman’s\] family”.[^56]

59     In conclusion, I found that Rahiman was a witness whose credit was impeached, and he was an unreliable witness whose testimony in court on the purpose and contents of the phone calls with the Accused at the material time simply could not be relied on.

### Reasons why Rahiman’s account of the purpose and contents of the calls with the Accused in P23 and P24 carried considerable weight and should be relied on

60     Having decided to impeach Rahiman’s credit, I agreed with the Prosecution that Rahiman’s oral testimony as to the purpose and contents of the calls with the Accused at the material time should be substituted with the relevant portions of his previous statements under s 147(3) of the Evidence Act, which stipulates that these former statements _shall_ “be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein”.

61     As to the _weight_ in which the Court should place on these statements, s 147(6) of the Evidence Act provides as follows:

>     In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to a statement admissible in evidence by virtue of this section regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to the accuracy or otherwise of the statement and, in particular, to the question whether or not the statement was made contemporaneously with the occurrence or existence of the facts stated, and to the question whether or not the maker of the statement had any incentive to conceal or misrepresent the facts.

62     I agreed with the Prosecution that Rahiman’s statements in P23 and P24 as to the purpose and contents of the calls with the Accused at the material time carry considerable weight and should be relied on for the following reasons.

63     First, these statements were made by Rahiman very close in time to the actual event, having been recorded just one day after the phone conversations in question had taken place. In fact, P23 was recorded less than 24 hours after Rahiman was arrested. There was therefore every reason to believe that when the statements were recorded, Rahiman was able to provide an accurate and reliable account of the phone conversations he was engaged in with the Accused just prior to his arrest.

64     Second, save for Rahiman’s bare and unsupported assertion that he was uttering nonsense, there was no objective evidence presented to the Court that Rahiman had embellished or given an unreliable account of the purpose and the contents of his phone conversations with the Accused in his statements. The Defence failed to point to any portion of the statements which would suggest any form of serious unreliability or falsity that would have ordinarily cautioned the Court against according considerable weight to these statements.

65     Third, even if Rahiman was depressed or under the influence of drugs at the material time, no good reason was proffered as to why he would falsely implicate the Accused in particular, whom he claimed to be close friends with since secondary school,[^57] and whom he had no bad blood or major quarrel with prior to his arrest.[^58] The Defence did not suggest any “incentive” for Rahiman to have “conceal\[ed\] or misrepresent\[ed\] the facts” pertaining to the Accused’s involvement (s 147(6) of the Evidence Act). In my judgment, the only explanation why he had mentioned the Accused in P23 and P24 was because he was speaking the truth about how the Accused had abetted the offence which he was caught red-handed committing.

66     Fourth, as explained above at \[56\], Rahiman’s account of the phone calls with the Accused in his statements was entirely cogent and coherent. When the purpose and contents of the phone calls as recounted by Rahiman in his statements were tested against “the objective facts and evidence”, in particular, the phone conversations and text messages exchanged between Hairul and the Accused, it was clear to me that Rahiman’s statements were “corroborated by the evidence given by the other Prosecution witnesses and the other circumstantial evidence” (_Selvarajan James v Public Prosecutor_ \[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 946 at \[28\]) and should therefore be accorded considerable weight.

### The Defence failed to raise a reasonable doubt against the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had arranged for Rahiman to deliver the said drug to Hairul at the identified location

67     The Defence did not provide any good reason or make any credible submission as to why Rahiman’s credit should not be impeached, or why Rahiman’s statements in P23 and P24 should not carry weight, except to simply repeat Rahiman’s testimony in court that he was uttering nonsense during the statement recording process due to the influence of drugs, [^59] which I have wholly rejected.

68     While the Accused had admitted that he was in contact with Rahiman at the material time, he failed to provide an account of the purpose and contents of the multiple calls he had with Rahiman which was convincing and detailed enough to cast doubt on the Prosecution’s case. No explanation was provided as to why, in the midst of a drug trafficking attempt, Rahiman would have entertained the Accused’s calls _multiple times_ just for the Accused to request for Rahiman to “slack together with \[the Accused\] … chitchat …or to just, talk outside”.[^60] The Accused’s claim was inherently unbelievable. When considered together with his blatantly false denial – even in the face of objective evidence – of having communicated with Hairul at the material time, it was clear that the Accused simply had no valid defence or rejoinder to the Prosecution’s case against him.

69     In conclusion, there was therefore _no reason_ for the Court to doubt that Rahiman was telling the truth in P23 and P24 in relation to the purpose and contents of the phone calls with the Accused at the material time. I therefore accepted what was stated in P23 and P24 as the true account of the phone conversations exchanged between Rahiman and the Accused, and the Accused’s role behind Rahiman being in possession of the said drug for the purpose of trafficking. Rahiman’s statements were corroborated by the fact that Rahiman had in fact turned up at the identified location with the said drug to look for “Customer A”,[^61] who was later revealed to be Hairul (see above at \[41\]).

70     Rahiman’s accounts in P23 and P24 thus established beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Accused who had contacted and communicated with Rahiman to arrange for Rahiman to deliver the said drug to Hairul at the identified location. Being the “middleman” who had sought to fulfil Hairul’s request for the said drug by arranging for Rahiman to deliver the said drug to Hairul at the identified location, I found that the Accused definitely knew that the said drug in Rahiman’s possession was for the purpose of trafficking, and the Accused had through his various phone calls with Rahiman at the material time intentionally and knowingly facilitated Rahiman being in possession of the said drug for the purpose of trafficking.

## Conclusion

71     For all of the foregoing reasons, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him accordingly of the Trafficking Charge. The Accused is currently serving sentence.
