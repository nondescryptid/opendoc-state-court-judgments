Landlord Tenancy Agreement – Breach – Renovation without consent – change of business – Waiver – Acceptance of rent – right of forfeiture

12 December 2019

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff is the landlord of the property at 49 Club Street (“49 Club St”). The Plaintiff entered into a tenancy agreement dated 1 February 2014 (the “Tenancy Agreement”) with the Defendant whereby the Plaintiff tenanted the ground floor of 49 Club Street (“the Demised Premises”) to the Defendant for a 3-year period from 22 February 2014 to 21 February 2017 at a monthly rent of $15,770.30.

2       At that time, t thathe 2nd level of 49 Club Street above the Demised Premises was tenanted by the Plaintiff to a research company known as Sustainalytics Pte Ltd (“Sustainalytics”) while the 3rd level of 49 Club St was tenanted to a company known as Ice Palace Singapore Pte Ltd. The Plaintiff also owns the property at 47 Club Street (“47 Club St”), which is next door to 49 Club St. During the material time, the Plaintiff ran a bistro and bar on the ground floor of 47 Club St.

3       The Defendant originally ran an Italian restaurant called Truffle Gourmet out of the Demised Premises. From around end January 2015 to February 2015, the Defendant carried out certain renovation works at the Demised Premises and changed its business to Drinks & Co. Kitchen (“DCK”).

4       On 1 September 2015, the Plaintiff, through his solicitors gave the Defendant a written notice of the Defendant’s alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement. Thereafter, two more written notices of alleged breaches dated 3 February 2016 and 17 February 2016 respectively were issued to the Defendant.

5       It is not in dispute that before the relationship between the parties broke down, the Plaintiff and the Defendant’s representatives were in discussions concerning the possibility of setting up a joint business venture that involved the operation of various bars and restaurants along Club Street. While the dispute that arose from the breakdown in their negotiations is not directly relevant for the purpose of the dispute concerning the alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement before me, it is nonetheless important background as it is the breakdown in that negotiations that led to the present action by the Plaintiff against the Defendant for the alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement[^1].

## The Plaintiff’s Case

6       The Plaintiff’s position is that, in carrying out the change of its business from Truffle Gourmet to DCK and in carrying out the renovation works in the Demised Premises without his approval, the Defendant had breached various provisions in the Tenancy Agreement, in particular, provisions that prohibit the Defendant from doing the following: (i) renovating the Demised Premises without the Plaintiff’s written consent, in particular, by “painting over the timber ceiling” and by “affixing, erecting or attaching on the wall or any part of the premises new signage and awnings”; (ii) using any part of the Demised Premises otherwise than as a restaurant; and (iii) interfering with the quiet enjoyment and comfort of adjoining occupiers. The Plaintiff also claims that the Defendant had incurred electricity charges while they were operating at the Demised Premises which they had failed to make payment of.

7       The Plaintiff alleges that because of the Defendant’s breaches of the Tenancy Agreement, the Plaintiff was entitled to terminate the lease and to re-enter and re-possess the Demised Premises. According to the Plaintiff, the tenancy was thus terminated by the Plaintiff on 25 February 2016, or at the latest, on 1 April 2016, and that, by staying on at the Demised Premises until 21 February 2017, the Defendant had held over the Demised Premises until 21 February 2017. The Plaintiff therefore claims that they are entitled to claim for double rent under section 28(4) of the Civil Law Act.

## The Defendant’s Case

8       In their Defence, the Defendant maintains that the Plaintiff has not proven any of the alleged breaches. The Defendant’s case is also that the Plaintiff had, either expressly or impliedly, consented to or waived all of the alleged breaches. As for the contention that the Plaintiff has waived his right to enforce against the alleged breaches, the Defendant says such waiver is to be inferred from the Plaintiff’s conduct at the meeting between the Plaintiff and the Defendant’s representative on 30 January 2015. The Defendant also says that the Defendant was induced to believe they were not in breach by the Plaintiff’s conduct[^2]. Further, the Defendant maintains that by virtue of the Plaintiff having received rental payments from the Defendant from the date of alleged termination up to the end of tenancy period, the Plaintiff had waived all of the alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement and is therefore not entitled to terminate the Tenancy Agreement and any of the claimed reliefs.

9       In their affidavits of evidence in chief, the Defendant set out the background regarding the parties’ negotiations to set up a joint business venture. According to the Defendant, prior to the events leading to the dispute between the parties, the Plaintiff and the Defendant’s general manager, Mr Richard Adam Irving (“Richard”), the Defendant’s directors and shareholders, Mr Robert Justin Frizelle (“Justin”) and Mr Lee Richard Harle (“Lee”) and the Defendant’s former director, Mr Nicola Sandoli (“Nicola”) were on cordial terms. Their cordial relationship led to negotiations for a proposed joint business venture between the Plaintiff and the Defendant and discussions relating to this proposed joint business venture to set up bars and restaurants along Club Street began sometime around May 2014.

10     According to the Defendant, negotiations between the parties continued throughout the time the Defendant carried out the renovation at the Demised Premises and changed its business concept until shortly before the commencement of this suit.[^3] According to the Defendant, even after the Plaintiff had sent a letter dated 1 September 2015 alluding to the Defendant’s alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement by allegedly converting the business at the Demised Premises from a restaurant to a bar and by carrying out renovation works without obtaining the approval of the Plaintiff, the parties had met in October in Suntec to discuss about the proposed joint business venture and the negotiations continued until February 2016 when the Plaintiff’s solicitor wrote to the Defendant reiterating the alleged breaches as stated in the Plaintiff’s letter of 1 September 2015[^4].

## Issues before This Court

11     At the trial, counsel for both parties agreed that the following issues arise out of this action:

> (a)     Whether the Defendant had breached the Tenancy Agreement[^5] (in particular, the covenant in Clause 3.4 and other relevant clauses such as Clauses 3.13(c) and 3.13(f) of the Tenancy Agreement) in performing renovation works at the Demised Premises in or around end January to February 2015 and, if so, whether the Plaintiff had waived his entitlement to object to the aforesaid breach (the “Renovation Issue”);

> (b)     Whether the Defendant had breached clause 3.11 of the Tenancy Agreement when it changed its business concept at the Demised Premises in or around February 2015 and, if so, whether the Plaintiff had consented to the change in business concept or waived the aforesaid breach (the “Business Concept Issue”);

> (c)     Whether the Defendant had breached clause 3.12 of the Tenancy Agreement by causing nuisance or annoyance to or in any way interfere with the quiet enjoyment and comfort of the adjoining occupiers of the Demised Premises and whether the Defendant is obliged to soundproof the Demised Premises (the “Noise Issue”); and

> (d)     Whether the Plaintiff had waived the Defendant’s breaches by virtue of the Plaintiff having received rent from the date of the purported termination (i.e. 25 February 2016 or latest by 1 April 2016) up to the end of the tenancy period (i.e. 21 February 2017) (the “Waiver Issue”).

> (e)     Whether the Defendant is liable to pay for the electricity charges for the months of January and February 2017, or, if the Tenancy Agreement had not been terminated before January or February 2017, whether the Defendant was in breach of clause 3.3 of the Tenancy Agreement (the “Electricity Charges Issue”); and

> (f)     Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to forfeit the security deposit, which the Defendant had paid pursuant to clause 2 of the Tenancy Agreement (the “Security Deposit Issue”).

## Renovation Issue

12     The Plaintiff alleges that in or around the last week of January 2015, he received a telephone call from Ms Michelle Uy (“Michelle”) who was then the office manager of Sustainalytics occupying the 2nd floor (the floor above the Demised Premises) and she complained to him about the noise caused by renovation works going on in the Demised Premises[^6]. The Plaintiff alleges that he was not informed about the renovation works and so he visited the Demised Premises[^7].

13     The Plaintiff said that prior to this, sometime after entering into the Tenancy Agreement, the Plaintiff was approached by Justin who was a shareholder of Drinks & Co, a bar operating across the Demised Premises and Justin had voiced his interest to take over the lease of the Defendant at the Demised Premises to run a business primarily focused on selling alcohol while offering food on the side[^8]. According to the Plaintiff, he did not agree at that time, as he was satisfied with the Defendant running the business of Truffle Gourmet at the Demised Premises. The Plaintiff said that when he went to the Demised Premises after receiving the phone call, it did cross his mind that Justin was going to try to change the business concept of the Defendant from that of a fine dining restaurant which Truffle Gourmet was to a bar business selling mainly alcohol[^9]. The Plaintiff reminded Justin that he was not supposed to carry out renovation works without his written consent and that he would not approve the change of business from a fine dining business to a business focussed on selling alcohol[^10].

14     In his affidavit of evidence in chief, the Plaintiff said that Justin did not disagree with the Plaintiff’s assertions. Justin then tried to negotiate terms with the Plaintiff to try and get the Plaintiff to agree to his plans for the Defendant[^11]. The Plaintiff further said, “...at the material time, I **_decided to withhold pursuing the issues_** _that I raised concerning the change of concept of the business of the Defendant and the renovation works in order to consider (Justin)’s joint venture proposals_ concerning the Defendants and his other businesses.”[^12] (Emphasis added). From what he has said, it is clear to me that, even by his own testimony, the Plaintiff has himself alluded to the fact that he did not raise the issues of the conversion of business and renovation or if he did, he did not pursue these issues with the Defendant at the material time. In the circumstances, it is clear to me that the indication given to the Defendant was that the renovation was not an issue that the Plaintiff was interested to pursue at the material time.

15     The Defendant’s evidence given through Justin is that, on or around 29 January 2015, Justin contacted the Plaintiff via WhatsApp to arrange for a meeting with the Plaintiff to discuss about the Defendant’s plans to renovate the Demised Premises and to change its business concept.[^13] From the WhatsApp messages, what is clear is that there was a meeting the next day, that is, on 30 January between the Plaintiff, and Lee on behalf of the Defendant and the meeting was to discuss, among other things, the change of concept and the renovation of the Demised Premises. Interestingly, in his affidavit of evidence in chief, the Plaintiff has chosen to be completely silent about the fact that this meeting occurred.

16     Thus, while the Defendant has given clear, cogent and consistent evidence through their various witnesses (Lee, Justin and Nicola) that the Defendant’s Lee had met with the Plaintiff on or around 30 January 2015 and such evidence is further corroborated by the WhatsApp messages between the Defendant’s Justin and the Plaintiff, and that at that meeting, the Plaintiff and the Defendant’s Lee had discussed the renovation works required to bring about the change of dining concept and design of the restaurant, albeit, according to the Defendant’s Lee, the Plaintiff was more keen to discuss the idea of a joint venture between the parties,[^14] the Plaintiff has chosen to be silent about this meeting in his affidavit of evidence in chief. According to the Defendant’s Nicola[^15] and Lee[^16] there was also a discussion over Skype between the Defendant’s former director, Nicola and the Plaintiff just before the meeting between the Defendant’s Lee and the Plaintiff on 30 January 2015 concerning the proposed joint venture as well as the renovation of the Demised Premises. Again, the Plaintiff has chosen to be silent on this Skype discussion between him and the Defendant’s Nicola in his affidavit of evidence in chief.

17     The Defendant’s evidence is also bolstered by the oral testimony of the Defendant’s Nicola during cross-examination where he reiterated that at the Skype call discussion between him and the Plaintiff on or around 30 January 2015, they had discussed the change of the Defendant’s business concept, and he recalls that the Plaintiff understood the business concept change and did not object to the same.[^17]

18     The Plaintiff’s silence on the meeting on 30 January 2015 and the Skype discussion would mean that the Defendant’s evidence as regards what transpired at the meeting and the Skype call on 30 January 2015 remains un-contradicted. Notably, when confronted with Lee’s evidence during cross-examination, the Plaintiff conceded that he was aware of the renovation works and the change in business concept by the Defendant[^18].

19     Further, the Defendant’s Nicola gave evidence that the Plaintiff had visited the Demised Premises and even advised the Defendant about how and where to do some renovation works. In particular, Nicola elaborated that whilst the renovation works were being carried out, the Plaintiff was at the Demised Premises with Nicola, who on one occasion asked the Plaintiff about a fake wall at the Demised Premises and what was behind it. The Plaintiff advised Nicola to remove the fake wall as there was a brick wall behind which would be nice and there would be more space.[^19] There is nothing in cross-examination to discredit Nicola’s testimony on this. Based on this unchallenged evidence, I am of the view that it is illogical that the Plaintiff would have given advice about the renovation if he had not consented to the renovation works.

20     In the circumstances, I find that, even if the Plaintiff had not explicitly given his approval or consent for the renovation, the Plaintiff had, by his conduct, represented to the Defendant that he has approved or consented to the renovation. In other words, the Plaintiff had acted in such a manner as to lead the Defendant to believe that he had agreed to allow the Defendant to carry out the renovation works.

21     During cross-examination, when the Plaintiff was put to answer that _“… in actual fact you had given express verbal consent to the renovation works and all the works that were done. You were happy with it. You were happy for them to commence operations. You never once objected at that point in time. You were far more concerned about the joint venture that you wanted to enter into with the Drinks & Co establishment, you agree?”[^20]_, he admitted, “_You, uh --- yes, you could say that.”[^21]_

22     In addition, when it was put to the Plaintiff that he “_never ever informed (the Defendant) that (he was) going to object to the renovation works or the other activity that they put up. In fact, (he) gave express consent. And then 6 months later, in September, when (he) realised that (the Defendant) are not going to perhaps do the joint venture on (his) terms. That is when (he) issue a threat to them, to kick them out if they don’t get into a joint venture agreement with (him)”[^22]_, he readily agreed with the Defendant’s counsel “_that this \[the renovation works\] is part of the overall negotiations_”[^23].

23     Further, the Plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to show that he had not consented to the renovation when or soon after he became aware of the renovation at the Demised Premises. There is no WhatsApp message, no correspondence, no emails sent by the Plaintiff to the Defendant expressing the Plaintiff’s objections to the renovation during the material time of him becoming aware about the renovation (such as after he allegedly received the “complaint” from Michelle). The first sign of the Plaintiff’s objections only surfaced on 1 September 2015 when the Plaintiff sent a letter to Richard and referred to the alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement.[^24]

24     Regarding the Plaintiff’s letter of 1 September 2015 alleging retrospectively, the breaches of the Tenancy Agreement by the Defendant, as the letter was sent after negotiations for the proposed joint business venture broke down, it is clearly an afterthought. It also deserves mention that when the Plaintiff was asked why he did not stop the renovation works, he admitted this was because the Defendant was “paying the rent[^25]”. This evidence supports the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff had not raised any objections to the renovation at the material time.

25     Thus, from the Plaintiff’s silence concerning the meeting on 30 January 2015, and the Plaintiff’s own testimony in cross-examination, I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the Plaintiff had initially consented to the Defendant carrying out renovation in the Demised Premises. Alternatively, the Plaintiff had, by his own conduct, agreed to waive his right to object to the alleged breach.

26     Further, an analysis of the WhatsApp messages on 29 January 2015[^26] between the Plaintiff and Justin shows that Justin’s testimony that the parties had started talking about a proposed joint business venture sometime in 2014 is more believable. In those WhatsApp messages, the Plaintiff alluded to the Defendant not being “keen to move on with the Plaintiff as spoken before”. The WhatsApp messages therefore show that the Plaintiff was more keen to discuss with Justin about the proposed joint venture rather than about the alleged breaches. The WhatsApp messages also show that the Defendant had intended to and did discuss about the renovation with the Plaintiff. For example, when the Plaintiff said, “You can’t renovate without my knowledge”, Justin responded with, “Not planning to. Free to meet today?” The WhatsApp messages between the Plaintiff and Justin further show that right up to July 2015, parties were still engaged in the discussions concerning the setting up of a joint business venture with the prospect of a MoU being drafted[^27]. This is at least 5 months after the renovation at the Demised Premises had been completed. This fact goes to show that the renovation at the Demised Premises and the proposed joint business venture were intended to be two separate matters.

27     Therefore, the Defendant’s evidence that the Plaintiff was informed about the renovation and had given his in-principle approval for the renovation is more credible. Alternatively, even if the Plaintiff had not expressly given his approval for the renovation, the Plaintiff had, by his conduct, induced the Defendant to believe that he had consented to the renovation or that he will not be enforcing the alleged “breach”. By virtue of that, the Plaintiff is estopped from saying that he objects to the renovation now.

28     Further, the Plaintiff knew about the renovation sometime around January or February 2015; yet the Plaintiff chose not to take issue with the renovation until September 2015 as in his own words, he “_decided to withhold pursuing the issues that (he) raised concerning the change of concept of the business of the Defendants and the renovation works in order to consider (Justin’s) joint venture proposals concerning the Defendants and his other businesses_.”[^28] It is therefore clear to me that it was the breakdown of the joint business venture that triggered this dispute and not the purported breaches of the Tenancy Agreement.

29     The Plaintiff has chosen to conflate the issues and chosen to link the need for his consent for the renovation works with the joint business venture negotiations. The Plaintiff would need to show evidence that the parties had agreed to link the two issues and that the Defendant was aware that the Plaintiff’s approval for the renovation works was subject to the parties reaching a successful conclusion as regards their proposed joint business venture. The Plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence to show that that was made clear to and agreed by the Defendant. The evidence shows that if at all, this idea of the Plaintiff to tie the two issues together was the Plaintiff’s own unilateral idea and that it is more of an afterthought on the part of the Plaintiff after negotiations on the joint business venture broke down. In any event, the renovation at the Demised Premises were completed some seven months before the Plaintiff first raised the issues regarding breaches of the Tenancy Agreement.

30     Accordingly, I find that the Plaintiff has not established his case that the Defendant has breached Clause 3.4 and other relevant clauses of the Tenancy Agreement in not obtaining the consent of the Plaintiff before carrying out the renovation works in the Demised Premises.

31     In any event, even if I find that there was a technical breach of Clause 3.4 of the Tenancy Agreement in that the Defendant had failed to obtain the written approval of the Plaintiff for the renovation works, in light of the Plaintiff’s own evidence that he had “_decided to withhold pursuing the issues that (he) raised concerning the change of concept of the business of the Defendant and the renovation works in order to consider (Justin)’s joint venture proposals concerning the Defendants and his other businesses_”, it is clear that the Plaintiff himself had indicated to the Defendant that he was prepared to waive his right to object to that technical breach since they were working towards setting up a joint business venture together. Having so waived his right to enforce the Tenancy Agreement as regards the renovation, the Plaintiff can no longer re-visit this issue and allege breach of the Tenancy Agreement.

32     Furthermore, the Plaintiff had continued to accept rent from February 2015 up to September 2015 when the Plaintiff sent a formal letter regarding the alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement. In the case of _Protax Co-operative Society Ltd v Toh Teng Seng & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 84</span>, it was held that it is a principle of law that, where rent has been tendered and accepted, so long as the landlord then knew of the breach, the acceptance constitutes a waiver of the right of forfeiture[^29]. Chan Seng Onn JC (as he then was) quoted the law from paragraphs 509 and 510 at p475 and 476 of _Halsbury’s Laws of England 4_th_Edn Reissue Vol 27(1)_ as:

> “The landlord has the option whether to take advantage of a forfeiture or not; and, if he elects not to do so, the forfeiture is waived. Such election may be either express or implied, and it is implied when, after the cause of forfeiture has come to his knowledge, the landlord does any act whereby he recognises the relationship of landlord and tenant is still continuing. If, however, it is shown that, with the knowledge of the cause of forfeiture, the landlord has recognised the tenancy, he will be precluded from saying that he did not do the act with the intention of waiving the forfeiture.” and

> “It is a question of fact whether it is tendered and accepted as rent; if it is so tendered and accepted, it is then a principle of law that, so long as the landlord then knew of the breach, the acceptance constitutes a waiver. Thus the fact that the landlord, by accepting rent, has no actual intention of waiving the breach does not prevent his action amounting in law to a waiver. Nor can the landlord prevent the waiver by demanding or accepting rent without prejudice.”

33     On the facts of this case, the Plaintiff had accepted the payment of rent from February 2015 when the cause of forfeiture came to the Plaintiff’s knowledge, until February 2016. The first time the Plaintiff indicated his non-acceptance of payments of rent from the Defendant was on 25 February 2016, about a year after the alleged breach, when the Plaintiff’s staff Addy Yu wrote to the DBS Bank to enquire about the unwanted money transfers from the Defendant. Thereafter, on 15 March 2016, the Plaintiff wrote a letter to the Defendant and enclosed a cheque for the sum of S$15,770.30, the amount of rent payment transferred by the Defendant by way of GIRO as the rent payment for the month of March 2016 as a gesture of the Plaintiff’s refusal to accept rent payment from the Defendant.[^30]

34     In my oral grounds released on 5 November 2019, I had mistakenly considered the fact of the Plaintiff’s acceptance of rent payment from February 2015 (when the Plaintiff came to know about the alleged breaches) all the way to the end of the tenancy period. I ought to have considered the Plaintiff’s acceptance of rent payment up to February 2016 only. Despite this error, however, my finding remains the same. This is because, the fact is that, even after having knowledge of the breach, the Plaintiff had continued to accept rent payment for one whole year thereafter. Though the Plaintiff took issue with the alleged breaches and issued a letter to the Defendant concerning the alleged breaches in September 2015, the Plaintiff, nonetheless, continued to accept rent after September 2015, all the way until February 2016.

35     Further, even after issuing the letter of September 2015 alleging breaches, the parties had met in Suntec to further their negotiations and discussions as regards the joint business venture. From the Plaintiff’s behaviour, it is clear to me that the non-acceptance of rent payment in March 2016 by the Plaintiff was an afterthought. Therefore, the facts and circumstances of this case clearly point to the acceptance of rent from February 2015 to at least, February 2016 and the recognition of the tenancy by the Plaintiff. This acceptance thereby operates, as a matter of law, to render the acceptance of rent by the Plaintiff as constituting a waiver, regardless of whether the Plaintiff has any intention for the acceptance to constitute a waiver or not.

36     Therefore, based on the circumstances of this case, and taking the evidence in totality, I find that the Plaintiff, by his conduct, had represented to the Defendant he was not objecting to the renovation. This constitutes an implied waiver of the Plaintiff’s right of forfeiture. Further, the Plaintiff’s continued acceptance of the rent after the right of forfeiture accrued in February 2015 constitutes an express waiver of the Plaintiff’s right of forfeiture for the alleged breaches of the Tenancy Agreement.

37     Thus, on the question whether the Defendant had breached Clauses 3.4, 3.13(c) and 3.13(f) of the Tenancy Agreement in performing the renovation works at the Demised Premises, I find that the Plaintiff’s purported objection to the renovation works which re-surfaced on or around 1 September 2015 via the Plaintiff’s 1st Letter[^31] after negotiations on the proposed joint business venture broke down, and some six months after the renovation works were completed, is but an afterthought.

38     In any event, even if there was a technical breach of the Tenancy Agreement in that the Plaintiff’s approval in writing for the renovation was not sought prior to the commencement of the renovation, the Plaintiff’s continued acceptance of rent after coming to know about the renovation till a year later constitutes, as a matter of the operation of a principle of law, a waiver of the Plaintiff’s right of forfeiture under the Tenancy Agreement.

## Business Concept Issue

39     For this issue, the Plaintiff is relying on Clause 3.11 of the Tenancy Agreement to say that the Plaintiff is entitled to terminate the lease because the Defendant has breached this clause.

40     Clause 3.11 of the Tenancy Agreement provides that the Defendant agreed “\[n\]ot to use or permit the Demised Premises or any part thereof to be used otherwise than as a restaurant...”[^32] The Plaintiff say that the Defendant, by operating a bar and an alcohol retail shop within the Demised Premises, had breached clause 3.11 of the Tenancy Agreement. The Plaintiff’s case is that the Defendant operated DCK as a bar and not a restaurant, because the sale of liquor and alcoholic drinks was the primary business while the sale of food is but an incidental business.[^33]

41     Other than a mere allegation, the Plaintiff has not adduced any cogent evidence to show the difference between a bar business and a restaurant business and that the business operated by the Defendant in the Demised Premises through DCK was not a restaurant business.

42     The Defendant’s evidence is that they are licensed by the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) to operate DCK as a “Foodshop (Restaurant)” at the Demised Premises[^34]. The Defendant has adduced supporting evidence to show that they did sell food at the Demised Premises when they operated as DCK after the renovation[^35]. During cross-examination, the Plaintiff conceded twice that as far as the authorities were concerned, DCK at the Demised Premises was classified as a restaurant.[^36]

43     As DCK has been classified by our local authorities such as the Urban Regulatory Authority and the National Environment Agency[^37] as a restaurant, in the absence of evidence that shows that the Defendant was not a restaurant, there is no basis for me to reach the conclusion that what the Defendant operated at the Demised Premises was not a restaurant and then to find that the Defendant has, consequently, breached Clause 3.11 of the Tenancy Agreement.

44     Further, the Plaintiff agreed that based on DCK’s menu[^38], DCK was serving food, as a restaurant should.[^39] In cross-examination, it was telling that the Plaintiff had to grasp at straws in maintaining his argument that the Defendant was not operating as a restaurant, despite clear evidence that DCK served substantive meals such as skirt steak and Iberico pluma pork with sides with descriptions such as “From the Grill”, by explaining that this was “bar food” which would “probably be microwaved” by a chef[^40].

45     Another point that the Plaintiff relies on to say that DCK was not operated as a restaurant is that DCK’s customers were rowdy which is inconsistent with the business of any restaurant.[^41] This position is untenable as there is nothing to show that noise level is a determining factor in deciding if a place is a restaurant or not. The Plaintiff himself conceded that the entire Club Street is by its nature, noisy and crowded[^42] and that it now has “rowdy bars”[^43].

46     At the trial proceedings, Counsel for the Defendant has also successfully established the fact that by virtue of the outdoor recreational area (ORA) scheme created by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”) and adopted by many of the establishments on Club Street (including DCK, Indochine, My Little Tapas Bar and Noti Restaurant), the establishments operating at Club Street are allowed to have their customers come out of the establishments to have their drinks outside, within a certain perimeter of the premises. It would appear that even the Plaintiff’s premises at 47 Club Street was not immune to rowdy guests as the Civil Defence had to be called to come and control the crowds at Club Street during the Dutch King’s Day event held at 47 Club Street[^44]. Thus, the fact that customers were rowdy and could bring their drinks to the ORA outside of the restaurant premises does not show that the Defendant was not operating a restaurant at the Demised Premises as the customers of other restaurants along Club Street, including the Plaintiff’s restaurant at 47 Club Street could also similarly do the same.

47     Overall, there is simply no basis whatsoever to conclude that the Defendant’s DCK was not a restaurant just because they had rowdy customers. The Plaintiff has therefore failed to establish that the Defendant was not operating DCK as a restaurant and that Clause 3.11 has been breached.

48     In any event, as with the renovation issue, even if there was a breach by the Defendant in converting its business from a restaurant business to a bar business, the Plaintiff’s continued acceptance of rent after knowing about the breach constitutes a waiver of the Plaintiff’s right of forfeiture under the Tenancy Agreement in law and the Plaintiff is thereby precluded from exercising his right of forfeiture.

## Noise Issue

49     The Plaintiff relies mainly on the evidence of Uy Michelle Loa (“Michelle”), the former office manager of the tenant occupying the premises above the Demised Premises (“Adjoining Premises”)[^45], to establish that the noise levels at the Demised Premises were a nuisance and an annoyance to the Adjoining Occupiers.

50     I find that the Plaintiff has not established his case for the following reasons:

> (i)     The Plaintiff’s evidence is limited to the testimony of Michelle. Michelle herself admitted that the “noise” from the Demised was “on and off”[^46]. She also conceded that Sustainalytics should have left the Adjoining Premises sooner if the alleged noise persisted and disrupted the Sustainalytics’ business.[^47] She also clarified that she did not complain about noise after office hours, therefore limiting her evidence to evidence of noise during office hours on weekdays, i.e., the evidence of noise is limited to a very short time since DCK’s opening hours starts only after office hours. As for her complaint about noise during the renovation, the evidence is limited to that short period of the renovation, which is about a month or so (around January 2015).

> (ii)     As for the Plaintiff’s allegation that the sound levels at the Demised Premises was that of “a party atmosphere” from as early as 11am, there is not a shred of evidence to substantiate this.

> (iii)     The Plaintiff has not shown that he has suffered any loss as a result of this alleged breach by the Defendant, as Sustainalytics did not terminate their tenancy with the Plaintiff. They had merely moved out from the 2nd floor to the 3rd floor of 49 Club Street. As for the Plaintiff’s inability to rent out the 2nd floor thereafter, the Plaintiff has not shown that this has anything to do with the Defendant. As confirmed by Torie Frances Doshi (“Torie”), an experienced estate agent called by the Plaintiff as the Plaintiff’s witness, there are many other factors at play affecting the rent-ability of a place. [^48]

51     It is the Defendant’s case that the lack of sound insulation is the main cause of disturbance to the occupiers of the second floor[^49]. The Defendant’s Nicola has stated that the Defendant’s representatives were often able to hear the footsteps of the people on the 2nd floor as they made their way across the room. Under cross-examination, Michelle, the Plaintiff’s only witness for the noise issue, conceded that she was not in a position to say if the responsibility of soundproofing the place or to ensure that Sustainalytics were not affected by noise is a responsibility that should fall on the Plaintiff as the landlord.[^50] Torie has confirmed that it would be the landlord’s responsibility to give the tenant quiet enjoyment and thus, in this case, the obligation to give to tenants such as Sustainalytics quiet enjoyment of their premises falls on the Plaintiff instead.[^51]

52     Torie also agreed that insulation would help to reduce noise[^52] and that carpeting and soundproofing of the windows was recommended for shop house units. Thus, it is the Plaintiff’s responsibility to do the necessary such as carpeting and soundproofing of the Demised Premises and the premises above the Demised Premises to control noise levels.[^53] In this regard, I note that the Plaintiff has admitted to putting up a sound barrier[^54] for the Demised Premises after the Defendant moved out. This shows that soundproofing to control noise levels affecting adjoining premises was necessary and the Defendant was not the sole cause of noise pollution affecting adjoining premises.

53     Similarly, the same applies in respect of this alleged breach as it applies to the renovation and business change issues – that, even if I conclude that the Defendant had breached this covenant of quiet enjoyment for adjoining premises, the Plaintiff’s acceptance of rent, after coming to know of the breach through Michelle’s “complaint” constitutes a waiver of the Plaintiff’s right of forfeiture.

## Electricity Issue

54     The Plaintiff’s claim for electricity charges is for electricity charges for the months of January and February 2017. Under the Tenancy Agreement, the Defendant is liable to pay for these electricity charges. Indeed, the Defendant has not mounted any defence in relation to this claim. I therefore find that the Defendant liable to pay the sum of $6,052.31 for the electricity charges for the Demised Premises for the months of January and February 2017.

## The Defendant’s Counterclaim

55     As it is not disputed that the Defendant has not been refunded the security deposit paid by them to the Plaintiff under the Tenancy Agreement, and as I have found no breach of the Tenancy Agreement by the Defendant, the Defendant is entitled to their security deposit of $47,310.90. Allowing the deduction of $6,052.31 payable by the Defendant for the electricity charges from the security deposit of $47,310.90, I will allow the Defendant’s counterclaim by ordering that the Plaintiff refund the balance security deposit of $41,258.59 to the Defendant.

## Conclusion

56     In conclusion, the Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed and the Defendant’s counterclaim is allowed, with costs for both the Plaintiff’s claim and the Defendant’s counterclaim awarded to the Defendant. When I delivered oral grounds on 5 November 2019, counsel for the Defendant requested for costs to be fixed. After hearing from both parties, I fixed costs at $25,000 plus reasonable disbursements plus GST. Accordingly, the Plaintiff is ordered to pay to the Defendant the sum of $41,258.59 and costs fixed at $25,000 plus reasonable disbursements plus GST.
