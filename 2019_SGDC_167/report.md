14 August 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## INTRODUCTION

1       Soh Jing Zhe, currently 21 years of age, was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) on 15 May 2018 for suspected drug offences. Some utensils used in connection with consuming drugs was seized from him. His urine specimen was subsequently taken and, upon analysis, was found to contain methamphetamine, a controlled drug under the _Misuse of Drugs Act_ (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”).

2       The defendant was initially remanded without bail being offered as he was suspected of having committed capital drug offences. The charges were subsequently withdrawn and he was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. He was released on bail on 19 November 2018.

3       In June this year he pleaded guilty to two charges under the MDA in relation to the unauthorised consumption of methamphetamine and the possession of the utensils for consuming the drug. On 26 June 2019 he was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. The sentence was backdated to take effect from 17 May 2018 (the date of his remand), with the period of his remand (from 17 May to 19 November 2018) to be taken into account for the computation of the sentence. The defendant filed the present appeal against the sentence the same day.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## PLEA OF GUILT

#### Charges

5       The defendant pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

> DAC-937620-2018 (the “**Consumption Charge**”)

> You \[...\] are charged, that you, on or about 15 May 2018, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, Methamphetamine, without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punishable under Section 33(1) of the aforesaid Act\[.\]

> DAC-937621-2018 (the “**Utensils Charge**”)

> You \[...\] are charged, that you, on the 15 May 2018, at about 8.43 pm, in motorcar SJL7646J at open carpark beside Blk 137 Yishun Ring Road, Singapore, did have in your possession utensils intended to be used in connection with the consumption of a controlled drug, _to wit_, one improvised bottle, one glass pipe and one plastic tube, without authorization under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 9 and punishable under Section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

#### Facts

6       The salient facts were as follows. On 15 May 2018 at about 8.43 pm, a party of officers from the CNB arrested the defendant. He was inside his car, at the open carpark beside Block 137 Yishun Ring Road. The following items were recovered from him: one improvised bottle, one glass pipe and one plastic tube (the utensils). He was taken to the CNB Headquarters for further investigations.

7       The defendant subsequently provided two bottles of urine samples which were marked and sealed in his presence and sent to the Health Sciences Authority for analysis. Upon analysis, the urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine, which is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

8       The defendant admitted to smoking “Ice” (the street name for methamphetamine). He last consumed “Ice” a few hours before his arrest. He would put some “Ice” into a glass pipe, then heat the pipe with a lighter and inhale the fumes from the tube. He admitted smoking “Ice” since December 2017 and he smoked “Ice” daily. He was not authorised to consume the drug. He also admitted that the items seized from him (one improvised bottle, one glass pipe and one plastic tube) were used by him to smoke “Ice”.

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

10     The prosecution sought the following sentences: 8-12 months’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge, and at least 3 months’ imprisonment for the Utensils Charge, with both sentences to run concurrently.

#### Plea in mitigation

11     In a written plea-in-mitigation, counsel urged the court to impose an imprisonment term of 6 months for the Consumption Charge and an imprisonment term of 4 weeks for the Utensils Charge, and for the two sentences to run concurrently. Counsel also submitted that the court should take into consideration the time that the defendant had spent in remand and afford him “a discount in sentence”[^1].

12     It was highlighted that at the time of the offence, the defendant was “only 20 years old”. It was submitted that rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing consideration. The defendant was contrite and sincerely remorseful for his actions. During the course of the investigations he was candid and truthful. While he was in remand pending a capital charge (for which he has been given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal), the defendant was terrified at the thought of being sentenced to death. His timely plea of guilt was further indication that he was genuinely remorseful for his actions. He had mixed with bad company in the past and done very foolish acts. Although the defendant has had a number of brushes with the law, this was his first drug offence. Since his release on bail in November 2018, he has made a concerted effort to turn over a new leaf.

#### Sentencing considerations

#### (a)   Sentencing objective

13     In deciding on the sentence, I considered the dominant sentencing objective in the present case to be that of deterrence, both general as well as specific deterrence. While rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing objective for a youthful offender, this was displaced in the present case by the need for deterrence. The drug offences committed by the defendant (while he was 20 years of age) were not his first offences against the law. He had prior convictions for a variety of offences, for which he had been sentenced to probation and subsequently undergone reformative training (summarised at \[9\], above). Although the prior convictions were not drug-related offences, they showed a disturbing propensity towards crime on the part of the defendant, which must be deterred. The rehabilitative sentences of probation and reformative training that the defendant had undergone have not, unfortunately, kept him away from further crime.

#### (b)   Appropriate sentence

14     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA (the Consumption Charge) is a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment or $20,000 fine or both. The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 9 of the MDA (the Utensils Charge) is a maximum of 3 years’ imprisonment or $10,000 fine or both.

15     Counsel for the defendant was in agreement that a custodial term ought to be imposed but sought a “discount” in the sentence such that, after the sentence was backdated, the defendant need not serve any more time in prison. In seeking a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge, counsel cited the case of _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> (“**_Dinesh Bhatia_**”), where a sentencing range of between 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment was set out for a first-time consumer of a Class A drug. A table of precedents was submitted by counsel showing some instances where a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment or less had been imposed.

16     In my judgement, a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment as sought by counsel would be inadequate in the present case. I agreed with the submission of the prosecution that the sentencing norm for a first offender for a charge of drug consumption was generally in the range of 8-12 months’ imprisonment (for a Class A controlled drug such as methamphetamine). In the present case there was no compelling reason to impose a sentence below that norm. The defendant, despite being only 20 years old when he committed the offence, was not a one-off social or recreational consumer of the drug. He had been consuming the drug _daily_ for about five months (from December 2017 until his arrest in May 2018). Considering his relatively young age, however, a sentence at the lower end of the sentencing range suggested by the prosecution would suffice (_i.e._, 8 months’ imprisonment). I also add that the precedents cited by counsel were distinguishable, and none of them supported his submission that a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was appropriate.

17     Counsel made a submission that if the defendant’s plea had been taken earlier (presumably while he was still in remand), and remission was taken into account, it was likely that there was no necessity for him “to further serve any more time”.[^2] Presumably, counsel’s argument was that if the defendant had been sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment when the plea was taken earlier, then considering his remand period of more than 6 months, and taking into account a one-third remission of the sentence, the defendant would have been released immediately after the sentence was backdated. I found this argument to be wholly speculative, however. It was not possible to say with certainty whether the defendant would have been granted a remission of sentence. In deciding upon what is an appropriate sentence _at the point that the present sentence is passed_, it would be highly speculative and wrong in principle to factor in any period of remission of the sentence. It would be incorrect to impose a discounted sentence on that basis.

18     In seeking a “substantial discount” in the defendant’s sentence, counsel subsequently made a separate submission that a _one-week imprisonment_ be imposed for both the Consumption Charge and the Utensils Charge, and for both sentences to run concurrently.[^3] Counsel did not elaborate and provide any rational basis for such an approach. I found the submission to be wholly unsupported by any rational sentencing principle or precedent, and rejected it entirely.

19     In relation to the Utensils Charge, a sentence in the range of 2-4 months’ imprisonment is generally imposed for a first offender. The sentence of at least 3 months’ imprisonment submitted by the prosecution was within that normative range. In my judgment, considering that the defendant was consuming the drug daily, but taking into account his relatively young age, a sentence of about 3 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

20     Given that the offences of drug consumption and possession of utensils for the consumption of the drug are closely connected and can be considered as part of the same transaction, it would be appropriate for the sentences to run _concurrently_.

#### (c)   Backdating of sentence

21     The defendant was in remand from 17 May to 19 November 2018. I accepted the submission of the defence (which was not opposed by the prosecution) that the sentence ought to be backdated to take effect from 17 May 2018 (when the defendant was first remanded), with the period of his remand (from 17 May to 19 November 2018) to be taken into account for the computation of the sentence. (See, for example, _PP v Sivanantha a/l Danabala_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 154</span>, where such an approach was applied by the High Court.)

#### Sentence imposed

22     Accordingly, the following sentences were imposed:

23     The execution of the sentence has been stayed pending the appeal. The defendant is presently on bail pending the appeal.
