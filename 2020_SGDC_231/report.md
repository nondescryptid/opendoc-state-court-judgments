\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 27/2020 and DCA 28/2020.\]

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff claims against the defendant the sum of $74,021.86, being the balance outstanding under an automobile lease agreement. The plaintiff has a further claim for the sum of $71,638, for the residual value of the vehicle. The defendant’s position is that the agreement is in reality, a hire-purchase agreement, that is void for illegality, as the defendant was not required to pay the 40% deposit stipulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

2       I allowed the plaintiff’s claim for the sum of $74,021.86, but dismissed the plaintiff’s claim for the residual value of the vehicle. Both the plaintiff and the defendant have appealed against my decision.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant is for the sum of $74,021.86, being the balance sum owing to the plaintiff under an automobile lease agreement dated 7 March 2017. The plaintiff has a further claim for the loss of the residual value of the vehicle.

4       According to the defendant, she wanted to purchase a Porsche Cayenne Turbo bearing registration number SLK7552C (“the Vehicle”) from 308 Phoenix Auto (“Phoenix”), a car dealer. In February 2017, the defendant and her husband, Stanley Neo (“Stanley”), met with Alvin Chia Kim Hong (“Alvin”), a salesperson of Phoenix, who proposed an arrangement for the defendant to purchase the Vehicle without paying any deposit, through a leasing scheme with the plaintiff.

5       The defendant claims that Alvin told them that the defendant would be able to obtain the title to the Vehicle, after they had made all the instalment payments under a leasing agreement. The defendant claims that she agreed to purchase the Vehicle for around the price of $233,000, but that the sale price would be marked up to $278,000 and that by inflating the price reported to the plaintiff, the plaintiff would disburse the sum of $250,200 in financing.[^1]

6       Thereafter, the defendant signed an automobile lease agreement dated 7 March 2017 with the plaintiff (“the Lease Agreement”), to lease the Vehicle for a period of 47 months.[^2]

7       In September 2017, the defendant contacted the plaintiff’s employee, Erwin Cheong Kah Tuck (“Erwin”). According to the defendant, Erwin assured the defendant that the title of the Vehicle would be transferred to the defendant at the end of the leasing period, upon payment of the residual value of the Vehicle.

8       In January 2018, the defendant defaulted in her rental payments under the Lease Agreement. In a letter dated 8 March 2018, the plaintiff’s solicitors notified the defendant of its intention to terminate the Lease Agreement and repossess the Vehicle, if the defendant failed to settle in full the outstanding sums in arrears within seven days. There was no response from the defendant.

9       In a letter dated 6 April 2018, the plaintiff’s solicitors notified the defendant that the Lease Agreement was terminated and requested that the defendant pay the outstanding sum due to the plaintiff and surrender the Vehicle. The defendant failed to surrender the Vehicle.

10     The plaintiff managed to track and repossess the Vehicle, which was found in a hotel in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The plaintiff subsequently sold the Vehicle to Dynamic Motoring (S) Pte Ltd (“Dynamic”).

11     The plaintiff commenced the action herein against the defendant for the sum of $74,021.86, being the balance sum owing to the plaintiff under the Lease Agreement. The plaintiff further claims the sum of $71,638.00 for the loss of the residual value of the Vehicle.

12     The defendant submits that the Lease Agreement was in reality a hire purchase agreement, that was void as a result of illegality, as it was in contravention of the Hire-Purchase (Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2013, in that the plaintiff had failed to collect a minimum deposit of 40% of the purchase price of the Vehicle.[^3] The failure to collect a minimum deposit was not expressly pleaded by the defendant in its defence.[^4]

13     The defendant further takes the position that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate its loss, by selling the Vehicle to Dynamic at a lower price than what was offered by another potential buyer, CH Auto Pte Ltd.

14     As for the plaintiff’s claim for the residual value of the Vehicle, the defendant’s position is that this claim amounts to double recovery, as the plaintiff had already repossessed and sold the Vehicle.

## Issues

15     The key issues at the trial were:

> (a)     Whether the Lease Agreement was void for illegality.

> (b)     Whether the plaintiff had failed to mitigate its loss by selling the Vehicle to Dynamic.

> (c)     In relation to the plaintiff’s claim for the residual value of the Vehicle, whether this claim amounts to double recovery as the plaintiff had already repossessed and sold the Vehicle.

## The allegation of illegality

16     I found that the Lease Agreement was not a hire purchase agreement, as the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement, did not provide for an option to the defendant to purchase the Vehicle.

17     The defendant claims that although the option was not provided for in the written Lease Agreement, it was told to her by Alvin and Erwin.

18     In Alvin’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief for the defendant, Alvin stated that he had introduced Stanley and the defendant to the plaintiff’s lease financing scheme, which he understood to be a lease-to-own scheme. His evidence was that under this scheme, the defendant would be offered the following three options at the end of the lease:

> a)    She could return the Vehicle to the Plaintiffs;

> b)    She could buy over the Vehicle via a final payment of the “estimated residual value” under the Leasing Agreement to the Plaintiffs in the sum of $71,624.00. As such, upon her making the final payment to the Plaintiffs, the registration of the Vehicle will then be transferred to her and she could deal with the Vehicle as she deemed fit; or

> c)    She could choose to sell the Vehicle to a 3rd party. In the event that the sale price for the Vehicle secured is higher than the “estimated residual value” of $71,624.00 under the Leasing Agreement, then she will receive the benefits of the balance sale amount for the Vehicle.[^5]

19     In Erwin’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief for the defendant, Erwin’s evidence was that he had told the defendant in a telephone conversation in September 2017, that at the end of the Lease Agreement, the defendant had three options. Erwin’s enumeration of the three options in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief,[^6] were word for word the same as the three options enumerated in Alvin’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief.

20     In cross-examination, it was pointed out to Alvin that the purported option to buy the Vehicle by paying the estimated residual value to the plaintiff, was not provided under the Lease Agreement. Alvin’s response was:

> But this is between the --- the lessee and the Hitachi, their ---their _later on_ --- how they --- how they going to agree, nobody knows, right?[^7]

> \[emphasis added\]

21     Alvin’s aforesaid evidence points to the mere possibility that the plaintiff may subsequently agree to sell the Vehicle to the defendant when the lease ends, rather than an option that is binding on the plaintiff once the Lease Agreement is entered into.

22     As for Erwin, when he was cross-examined on this, he agreed that this option was not in the Lease Agreement, but even in re-examination, he was unable to give the reason for this.[^8]

23     In the circumstances, I am unable to accept that there was an oral option as alleged by the defendant, which is contrary to the express terms of the written Lease Agreement. In view of the written Lease Agreement, once the Lease Agreement comes to an end, although it may be open to the plaintiff to sell the Vehicle to the defendant, there is no legal obligation on the plaintiff to do so, as it is not provided for under the written Lease Agreement.

24     Although the Lease Agreement form signed by the defendant provides for an “Estimated Residual Value (For reference only)”,[^9] the words “For reference only”, points towards it being open to the plaintiff to accept an offer from the defendant to purchase the Vehicle at the end of the lease, rather than a binding option for a fixed sum. If the plaintiff receives an offer from a third party for a higher price than that offered by the defendant, it is open to the plaintiff to accept such a third party offer. The plaintiff is not bound to sell to the defendant.

25     The defendant has sought to rely on the plaintiff’s Application Entry Form, where the computation of the sum to be disbursed by the plaintiff, is under the heading “Hire Purchase Details”.[^10] However, the Application Entry Form does describe the product as “Finance Lease”. In cross-examination, the manager of the plaintiff’s risk management department (collection section), Gerk Lay Hui, explained that this document was the plaintiff’s “system internal copy”.[^11] As there is no evidence that the defendant was ever shown this document prior to its disclosure in the course of this action, it could not be said to be a document relied upon by the defendant, prior to the defendant signing the Lease Agreement.

26     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I am unable to accept the defendant’s contention that the Lease Agreement was in reality a hire-purchase agreement.

27     In any event, in _Ting Siew May v Boon Lay Choo_ (“_Ting Siew May_”) <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 609</span>, the Court of Appeal held at \[66\]:

> … where a contract is entered into with the object of committing an illegal act, the general approach that the courts should undertake is to examine the relevant policy considerations underlying the illegality principle so as to produce a _proportionate_ response to the illegality in each case.

> \[emphasis in original\]

28     The Court of Appeal further held at \[70\]:

> We would summarise the general factors which the courts should look at in assessing proportionality in the context of contracts entered into with the object of committing an illegal act as including the following: (a) whether allowing the claim would undermine the purpose of the prohibiting rule; (b) the nature and gravity of the illegality; (c) the _remoteness or centrality_ of the illegality to the contract; (d) the object, intent and conduct of the parties; and (e) the consequences of denying the claim.

> \[emphasis added\]

29     In _Ting Siew May_, the respondents’ claim against the appellant was on an option to purchase a property, which was falsely dated earlier, so as to enable the respondents to obtain a higher bank loan, in circumvention and contravention of a Monetary Authority of Singapore notice that was effective on the actual date of the option. The Court of Appeal considered the remoteness or centrality of the illegality the most important factor, as the false date which was “the objectionable part of the transaction resided within the Option itself and not outside it” (at \[85\]).

30     In the present case, there is no dispute that the Lease Agreement per se is not illegal. There is no illegality within the Lease Agreement itself. What the defendant is essentially alleging is that there was a collateral oral agreement that effectively varied the Lease Agreement into a hire-purchase agreement and that such a hire-purchase agreement was void for illegality, as no deposit was required or paid. As the plaintiff’s claim is based on the Lease Agreement itself, rather than the purported collateral oral agreement, the purported collateral oral agreement can hardly be said to be central to the contract.

31     As for the other factors to be considered in assessing proportionality, my findings are as follows:

> (a)     Whether allowing the claim would undermine the purpose of the prohibiting rule: As the Lease Agreement itself does not offend the prohibiting rule, allowing the claim based on the Lease Agreement, would not undermine the purpose of the prohibiting rule. To avoid falling foul of the prohibiting rule in this case, it is not that such lease agreements cannot be entered into, it is that in the marketing of such lease agreements, there must not be any representation made that the lessee has the option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease. Lessees should be made aware that any such representation would be outside the lease agreement and unenforceable. It may be open to the lessor to sell the vehicle to the lessee at the end of the lease, but there is no binding legal obligation on the lessor to do so.

> (b)     The nature and gravity of the illegality: The nature of the alleged illegality would be in the purported representation made, rather than the Lease Agreement itself.

> (c)     The object, intent and conduct of the parties: The defendant sought to rely on the Court of Appeal decision in _Ochroid Trading Ltd v Chua Siok Lui_ (“_Ochroid Trading_”) <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 363</span>, which upheld the High Court’s finding that the purported commercial investments in that case, were always intended to be unlicensed moneylending transactions, that were disguised through invoices that the lenders knew were fabricated. In our present case, the written agreement supports the plaintiff’s position that the transaction is a lease, rather than a hire-purchase agreement. It is only the purported representations relied upon by the defendant, that the defendant says points to the transaction being in reality a hire-purchase, rather than a lease agreement.

> (d)     The consequences of denying the claim: In _Ting Siew May_, the Court of Appeal found that “the most that could be said of the Respondents’ loss if their present claim is denied is that they might incur cancellation fees if they chose to cancel the loan from the Bank” (at \[93\]). In the present case, the consequences of denying the claim would be much more severe, as the defendant defaulted in her monthly rental payments, just 9 months after the commencement of the lease period of 47 months.

32     I would add that a key distinction between _Ochroid Trading_ and our present case is that _Ochroid Trading_ involves an unlicensed moneylending transaction. It is expressly provided under section 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed), that:

> Where any contract for a loan has been granted by an unlicensed moneylender, …  -

>> (a)    the contract for the loan … shall be unenforceable; and

>> (b)    any money paid by or on behalf of the unlicensed moneylender under the contract for the loan shall not be recoverable in any court of law.

33     In _Ochroid Trading_, the aforesaid provision was not applicable at the relevant time (at \[223\]). Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal held that the enactment is “entirely in line with the robust approach which has been consistently taken by Parliament in addressing unlicensed moneylending”, to “ensure that an illegal moneylender should not be able to recover a loan made by him” (at \[224\]).

34     The alleged illegality in our present case, does not arise from an unlicensed moneylending transaction. There is no similar provision under the Hire-Purchase Act, (Cap 125, Rev Ed 2014), that would render the contract in this case unenforceable. Section 33 of the Hire-Purchase Act merely renders specific provisions of the agreement which are contrary to the Hire-Purchase Act to be void and of no effect, rather than rendering the entire contract unenforceable.

35     Furthermore, in the decision of _Belvoir Finance Co Ltd v Stapleton_ <span class="citation">\[1971\] 1 QB 210</span> (“_Belvoir Finance_”), referred to by the defendant, Lord Denning MR, held as follows (at 218E):

> I do not accept the proposition that the court can never look at an illegal contract. It will look at it whenever it is just and proper so to do. … it will look at the contract to see what sum the finance company have lost, that is, the balance of the hire-purchase price.

36     The defendant sought to distinguish _Belvoir Finance_, on the basis that the claim in _Belvoir Finance_, was in conversion.[^12] I disagree with the distinction drawn by the defendant. In _Belvoir Finance_, Lord Denning MR made the following observation (at 218D):

> Mr. Ross-Munro argued that, when the hire-purchase is illegal, the finance company cannot prove what the balance is except by reference to the hire-purchase agreement: and, as they cannot rely on it, they should recover nothing. The judge rejected that argument, but he went to the other extreme. He thought that the hire-purchase agreement should be ignored altogether, and that in consequence the finance company should receive the full value of the car at the date of conversion. He gave them, therefore, _more_ than they would have recovered if the hire-purchase agreement had been lawful.

> \[emphasis in original\]

37     Lord Denning MR rejected both extremes and allowed the finance company’s claim based on the balance of the hire-purchase price under the contract, as it was “just and proper” to do so. Although the claim was in conversion, the court was prepared to look at the contract, to ascertain the loss to the finance company, rather than reject the claim entirely or allow the claim based on the value of the car that was more than that loss.

38     In the light of the aforesaid, even if there were the oral representations by Alvin and Erwin alleged by the defendant, the court is entitled to look at the Lease Agreement to ascertain the balance that is owing to the plaintiff.

## Mitigation

39     The defendant has submitted, that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate its losses by selling the Vehicle to Dynamic, instead of selling the Vehicle to CH Auto Pte Ltd at a higher price. CH Auto Pte Ltd had bid $180,000 for the Vehicle,[^13] whereas Dynamic’s bid was significantly lower at $119,500.[^14] There were five other bids, ranging from $108,000 to $113,899.[^15] Dynamic’s bid was not too far above the other bids, whereas CH Auto Pte Ltd’s bid was more of an outlier.

40     In _The “Asia Star”_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 1154</span>, the Court of Appeal observed at \[43\], that “There is certainly support for the view that the court should adopt a generous approach in assessing the aggrieved party’s conduct in mitigation.” The Court of Appeal at \[43\], agreed with the following observation in _Banco de Portugal v Waterlow and Sons, Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1932\] AC 452</span> at 506:

> It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it, but _such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held \[to be\] disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken._ \[emphasis added by the Court of Appeal\]

41     CH Auto Pte Ltd was controlled by the defendant, who was the only director and shareholder of the company.[^16] I am of the view that the plaintiff was entitled not to sell the Vehicle to an entity controlled by the defendant for the following reasons:

> (a)     The defendant had already defaulted in making payment of the sums due to the plaintiff under the Lease Agreement and had failed to surrender the Vehicle when the plaintiff terminated the Lease Agreement. The plaintiff, through its repossessing agent, had to track the Vehicle to a hotel in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, in order to recover the Vehicle.

> (b)     After repossessing the Vehicle, the plaintiff discovered that the defendant had illegally modified the Vehicle, in that its original exhaust pipe had been altered without the approval of the Land Transport Authority. This illegal modification had to be rectified, to enable the Vehicle to pass its VICOM inspection.

> (c)     The bid originally placed by CH Auto, rather than CH Auto Pte Ltd, was unsigned and was not on the tender form required by the plaintiff.[^17]

> (d)     The bid subsequently placed by CH Auto Pte Ltd on the tender form, was signed by Stanley,[^18] whom the plaintiff discovered was an undischarged bankrupt[^19] and was neither a director nor shareholder of the company.

> (e)     A further bid placed by CH Auto Pte Ltd on the tender form, was signed by the defendant, but this bid was only sent on 17 May 2018 at 5:16 pm,[^20] after the plaintiff’s extended deadline of 5pm.

42     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that the plaintiff was entitled to treat the bid from CH Auto Pte Ltd with suspicion and that it was reasonable for the plaintiff to sell to Dynamic instead, which was the highest of the six other bids received by the plaintiff. In deciding not to accept the bid from CH Auto Pte Ltd, it is reasonable for the aforesaid factors to be considered, for if the sale was not completed because payment was not received from CH Auto Pte Ltd, the plaintiff would have to try and sell the Vehicle again at a later date, for a potentially lower price than the bid it received from Dynamic, in view of the Vehicle being a depreciating asset.

43     The defendant has also raised the argument that the plaintiff could have mitigated its loss by renting the Vehicle, at the same rental rate when it was leased to the defendant.[^21] However, there is no evidence that there were parties who would have been prepared to rent the Vehicle at such a rate, after the plaintiff had repossessed the Vehicle.

44     Furthermore, the Vehicle was originally registered in March 2011.[^22] At the time it was leased to the defendant in March 2017, the Vehicle was already 6 years old and had just 4 years left, before its Certificate of Entitlement expired in March 2021. The Lease Agreement was terminated in April 2018, more than a year later. Accordingly, after the Vehicle was repossessed, the Vehicle had less than 3 years left. In the circumstances, the defendant’s argument that the Vehicle could have been rented at the same rate was not realistic.

45     In the premises, I disagree with the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate its loss. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s claim for the sum of $74,021.86, being the balance sum owing to the plaintiff under the Lease Agreement, after taking into consideration the sale of the Vehicle to Dynamic, was allowed.

## The residual value claim

46     As for the claim for the sum of $71,638.00 for the loss of the residual value of the Vehicle, I agree with the defendant’s submission that this sum is already included in the price of the Vehicle when it was sold to Dynamic.[^23] There would be double recovery, if the plaintiff were allowed to recover this sum.

47     In making its claim for the loss of the residual value of the Vehicle after the Vehicle had already been sold, the plaintiff was in effect seeking to recover the value of the Vehicle a second time. In the premises, I disallowed this claim.

## Conclusion

48     In the light of the aforesaid reasons, judgment was entered for the plaintiff’s claim for the sum of $74,021.86 and costs.
