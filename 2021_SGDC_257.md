Immigration – Criminal offences – Overstaying

\[LawNet Editorial Note: The appeal in MA 9260/2021/01 was withdrawn on 24 November 2021.\]

17 November 2021

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 22-year-old male from the People’s Republic of China, overstayed in Singapore without reasonable cause from 10 March 2021 to 4 November 2021 after the expiry of the short-term visit pass issued to him on 27 January 2021. The period of overstaying was seven months and 26 days (or 240 days).

2       On 10 November 2021, the accused pleaded guilty to the singular charge of remaining in Singapore unlawfully when his short-term visit pass expired on 9 March 2021. He was unrepresented.

3       I imposed a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. The sentence was backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest on 4 November 2021.

4       On 11 November 2021, a Notice of Appeal was filed by defence counsel engaged by the accused’s mother on behalf of the accused against the sentence imposed on him.

5       On 15 November 2021, a hearing for bail pending appeal was convened. At the hearing, the accused was informed that his mother has engaged a lawyer and filed an appeal against sentence on his behalf. Defence counsel was present in court for the hearing. This was acknowledged by the accused. I granted a stay of execution on sentence. Bail pending appeal was offered at $30,000 with at least half the bail sum to be monetary security and the bailor to be a Singaporean.

6       The accused informed the court that he did not wish to be bailed out and wanted to continue serving his sentence pending the appeal.

## Background facts

### The Charge

7       The proceeded charge reads as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.72%"> <col width="70.28%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description of the Charge</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922090-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">You, are charged that from 10 March 2021 to 4 November 2021 did contravene the provisions of Section 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, Rev Ed 2008), to wit, that you without reasonable cause, did remain in Singapore for a period of 7 Months and 26 Days (240 days) after the expiry of the Visit Pass issued to you on 27 January 2021 permitting you to remain in Singapore till 9 March 2021 and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 15(3) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, Rev Ed 2008) and punishable under Section 15(3)(b) of the said Act.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

8       As the accused has remained unlawfully in Singapore for a period exceeding 90 days, pursuant to s 15(3)(b) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, 2008 Rev Ed) (“IA”), the accused was liable to be punished with mandatory imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months. Additionally, as the accused is not more than 50 years of age pursuant to s 325(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”), he was liable to be punished with caning of not less than three strokes.

### Statement of facts

9       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 10 November 2021 without qualification.

10     In essence, the accused was first issued with a Student’s Pass (“STP”) from 21 February 2019 to 9 February 2020 to undertake a Bachelor of Arts and Hospitality course at PSB Academy, Singapore. He was also granted a visit pass to remain here for the duration of the STP.

11     Upon the expiry of his STP, he was issued with a short-term visit pass valid from 9 November 2020 to 10 December 2020. Investigations revealed that after his short-term visit pass expired on 10 December 2020, he continued to remain in Singapore unlawfully until 27 January 2021. The period which he had overstayed was 48 days. For this period of overstaying, the accused was offered a composition of $300. The accused compounded the matter on 27 January 2021 when he reported to the Visitor Services Centre. He was then issued with another short-term visit pass with a validity period of 27 January 2021 to 9 March 2021.

12     Upon the expiry of his second short-term visit pass on 9 March 2021, the Accused did not leave Singapore or apply for further extension of his stay. He then remained unlawfully in Singapore without reasonable cause from 10 March 2021 until his arrest on 4 November 2021, which was a period of 240 days (7 months and 26 days).

## Antecedents

13     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

14     The Prosecution orally submitted for a sentence of at least six weeks’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum three strokes of the cane.

15     The Prosecution submitted that duration of the custodial sentence sought was the sentencing norm based on the period of overstaying of 240 days, which was more than 6 months. This was also 150 days more than the 90-day period.

16     The Prosecution further urged the court, when sentencing, to consider that the accused had earlier been allowed to compound the offence of overstaying for a period of 48 days by paying the composition amount of $300. Despite this, the accused once again decided not leave Singapore and remained unlawfully in Singapore after his second short-term visit pass expired on 9 March 2021. Moreover, this time round, it was for an even longer period.

## Mitigation

17     The accused orally submitted for the court’s leniency in sentencing. He admitted that it was his fault for overstaying. This was his first offence. He wanted to plead guilty and return to China as soon as possible.

18     The accused explained to the court that after he had completed his studies in Singapore, he tried to look for a job but was unsuccessful due to the covid-19 pandemic. He knew that he should have returned home instead of overstaying but did not.

19     After he paid the composition amount for overstaying the first time, he tried to look for a job once again but was still unsuccessful. Moreover, due to the covid-19 pandemic, he found it difficult to find a flight to return to China.

20     I explained to the accused that finding a job is not a reasonable cause for unlawfully remaining in Singapore. He accepted that it was not. Further, I asked him if he had sought help from the relevant authorities like the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) or the embassy of his home country to secure a flight to return home, he admitted that he did not.

21     Finally, as he was worried about his belongings which were still at his place of lodging in Singapore, he requested for the assistance of the ICA officers to make arrangements for them to be retrieved. The Prosecution informed the court that this could be arranged nearer to his release from prison.

## Decision on sentence

22     The issue before me was the appropriate sentences to impose on the accused for the proceeded charge.

23     S 15(1) read with s 15(3)(b) of the IA states:

> **Unlawful entry or presence in Singapore**

> 15.—(1)    A person shall not remain in Singapore after the cancellation of any permit or certificate, or after the making of a declaration under section 14(4) or after the expiration or notification to him, in such manner as may be prescribed, of the cancellation of any pass relating to or issued to him unless he is otherwise entitled or authorised to remain in Singapore under the provisions of this Act or the regulations.

> …

> (3)    Any person who contravenes, without reasonable cause, this section shall be guilty of an offence and —

>> (_a_)    in the case where he remains unlawfully for a period not exceeding 90 days, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $4,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both;

>> (_b_)    in the case where he remains unlawfully for a period exceeding 90 days, shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and shall also, subject to sections 325(1) and 330(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010, be punished with caning with not less than 3 strokes, or where by virtue of that section he is not punishable with caning, he shall, in lieu of caning, be punished with a fine not exceeding $6,000.

24     Since I have imposed the mandatory minimum number of three strokes of the cane on the accused and the accused is not above 50 years of age, I would proceed to give my reasons for the sentence of imprisonment imposed.

25     The need for severe punishments to be imposed on immigration offenders who enter or overstay in Singapore illegally is to ensure law and order in our society. Such punishments include mandatory imprisonment term and caning. Overstayers, like the accused, generally overstay to either work or seek employment illegally and these offences can be difficult to detect. If effective measures are not taken to deal with these offenders, this can cause long-term and serious problems that affect the society, economy, security and stability of Singapore.

26     In 1989, the prescribed punishment for overstaying in excess of 90 days under s 15(3)(b) of the IA was amended by Parliament from an imprisonment term of between six months and two years and a fine of up to $6,000 to an imprisonment term between three months and two years and caning of not less than three strokes. The then Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Dr Lee Boon Yang stated during the second reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (26 January 1989), vol 52 at col 595) the reasons:

> Long term overstayers not only blatantly break our immigration and employment laws but they also pose a threat to our society. By circumventing work permit rules to work here illegally, overstayers are not subject to stringent checks carried out by the Work Permit Department to weed out known criminals. They are also subjected to medical clearance imposed by the Work Permit Department. These overstayers threaten our law and order and may carry infectious diseases. Left undetected for too long, they may attempt to sink roots here, with even more serious long-term consequences to the society.

> _We cannot afford to take a casual attitude towards this problem. If we do not take effective measures now, others will find it more attractive to enter or to stay illegally to work here or to seek their fortunes here. We are not against people coming to Singapore to work or even to seek their fortunes here. But they must do so lawfully_. \[emphasis added\]

27     In 1995, Parliament amended s 15(3)(b) of the IA to remove the mandatory minimum sentence of three months’ jail term and to cap the maximum imprisonment term at six months. The legislative intent was to firstly prevent foreigners from clogging up our prisons such that more immigration offenders who might otherwise be let off the hook due to the prisons’ limited capacity could be prosecuted. Secondly, the mandatory provision for caning has proved to be very effective as hardly any immigration offender who has been caned returns to Singapore. For persons who are not liable to be caned under our laws e.g. men above 50 years old and women, a provision has been made for them to be fined up to $6,000 instead.

28     The reasons for the 1995 amendment were articulated during the second reading of the Immigration (Amendment) Bill by the then Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (1 November 1995), vol 65 at col 78 to 79).

29     The reasons for the two separate amendments made to s 15(3)(b) of the IA were similarly discussed by the District Court in _PP v Monica Rachelle Vinca Rosea_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 137</span> (_“Monica”)_ at \[12\] and \[13\].

30     As for the key factors to consider when sentencing overstayers, they are the length and purpose of overstaying. This have been applied in other reported decisions like _Monica_ (at \[17\]) and _PP v Nomana Intekhab Hadi_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 342</span> (_“Nomana”)_ (at \[15\]).

31     In respect of the purpose of overstaying, the failure of the accused to obtain legal employment in Singapore, as conceded by the accused, cannot be a valid reason for overstaying. Moreover, when he overstayed during the earlier period for 48 days, he was already given a chance by the authorities to compound the offence by paying a fine of $300 and return home. Despite that, he refused to return home and decided to remain even longer in Singapore to seek his fortune.

32     As for the accused’s excuse of not being able to book a flight back to China due to the covid-19 pandemic, the accused admitted that he had no proof that this was indeed the case. He also could not prove that he had tried to seek for assistance from ICA or his embassy to be repatriated home. In any event, during the 240 days which he had unlawfully remained in Singapore, he did not at any time apply for the validity of his visit pass to be extended.

33     As regards the length of overstaying, this should be commensurate with the length of the custodial sentence to be imposed. A summary table of reported precedent cases provides guidance as to the indicative length of imprisonment term as follows:

34     In the present case, the accused had overstayed for 240 days. Based on the period of overstaying, the accused’s case fell in between that of _Nicole Louise Sobotker_ (s/no. 4) at 5 weeks’ imprisonment and _Ly Van Phuc_ (s/no. 5) at 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

35     Following from there, in coming to my decision on sentence, I took into consideration the mitigating factors raised by the accused, including his early plea of guilt, his remorsefulness and the fact that he was a first offender. I did not take into account the earlier composition paid by him.

36     All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment in the present case is appropriate. The sentence imposed on the accused, which is at the lower end of the sentencing range, could not in my view be said to be manifestly excessive.

37     Finally, I backdated the accused’s sentence to commence on the date of his arrest on 4 November 2021.
