Injunctions – Interlocutory injunction

Injunctions – Purposes for grant – Protection of contractual rights

20 July 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Kevin Kwek:

1       This is an _ex-parte_ interim injunction application made by the plaintiff to restrain the second defendant, Singapore Swimming Club (the “Club”) from convening a management committee (“MC”) meeting to decide whether to ratify or revoke a decision to suspend the plaintiff’s membership rights for one month; and from acting on a complaint made by the first defendant against the plaintiff pending the determination of the main action in Originating Summons No 65 of 2020 (“OSS 65”).

2       OSS 65 is currently scheduled to be heard on 14 August 2020. The MC meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, 21 July 2020.

3       I should highlight at the outset that this application was made on 15 July 2020 on an _ex-parte_ basis, just six days before the scheduled MC meeting. While the plaintiff was directed on 16 July 2020 by the Duty Deputy Registrar to give the Club notice of the hearing on 17 July 2020, the Club did not have the opportunity to put forth its evidence by way of affidavits. In the circumstances, the hearing proceeded on an _ex-parte_ with notice basis, with only the evidence of the plaintiff before the court.

4       Having considered parties’ submissions and affidavits of the plaintiff, I grant the interim injunction. My reasons are set out below.

## Background

5       The plaintiff is a member of the Club and was its past president from 1992 to 1998. The plaintiff is an advocate and solicitor. According to the plaintiff, he had made known his intention some time in 2019 to stand as a candidate for the post of president in the Club’s elections in 2020 (“Club Elections”).[^1] The plaintiff officially notified the MC of his intention to stand as a candidate in the Club Elections by way of a letter dated 30 March 2020.[^2]

6       The first defendant is a member of the Club. The first defendant is an advocate and solicitor. On 3 March 2020, the first defendant made a written complaint to the Club’s general manager (“GM”) against the plaintiff for an alleged unauthorised circulation of certain documents purportedly made by the plaintiff.[^3] The contents of the documents are not material to the present application.

7       The written complaint led to an exchange of correspondence between the plaintiff’s solicitors and the Club’s GM.[^4]

8       On 18 March 2020,[^5] the GM informed the plaintiff that that the former had concluded his investigations into the first defendant’s complaint. In his letter to the plaintiff, the GM expressed his view that the plaintiff had breached rule 13(b) of the Club Rules for the alleged unauthorised circulation of documents. The plaintiff was also informed that the GM’s decision was to therefore suspend the plaintiff’s club membership for one month pursuant to rule 13(c) of the Club Rules although this decision would not take effect until it was ratified by the MC under rule 13(d).

9       In the same letter, the plaintiff was informed to attend a MC meeting on 24 March 2020 to address the MC before a decision was made on whether to ratify or revoke the GM’s decision. The plaintiff was also informed that if he did not to attend the meeting, the MC would make a decision in his absence.[^6]

10     The plaintiff objected to the GM’s decision to suspend his membership for one month. As mentioned above, letters were sent by the plaintiff’s solicitors to the Club prior to (and after) the 24 March 2020 meeting stating, _inter alia_, that rule 13(b) had not been made out and that the complaint was made in bad faith.[^7] As the first defendant is (or was) also a key administration committee member of the Club who deals with the employment issues of the Club, the plaintiff asserted that the GM’s investigations were therefore “not appropriate” given the GM’s “allegiance” to the first defendant.[^8]

11     The plaintiff did not attend the 24 March 2020 MC meeting and sought an update of the MC’s decision by way of letters to the Club on 26 March 2020[^9] and 31 March 2020.[^10]

12     On 6 April 2020, the Club informed the plaintiff that the MC had decided to adjourn the 24 March 2020 meeting to a later date to give the plaintiff an opportunity to be heard.[^11] The subsequent meeting date was not fixed as the Club had to shut down most of its facilities and operations as it was announced by the government that a circuit breaker period was to commence on 7 April 2020 to 4 May 2020 to reduce the local transmission of the coronavirus disease. The circuit breaker period was subsequently extended to 1 June 2020.

13     On 17 June 2020, the plaintiff filed OSS 65 to challenge the validity of the suspension and the MC’s right or authority to deal with the suspension. OSS 65 was served on the Club on 18 June 2020. In gist, the plaintiff’s case in OSS 65 is that the GM has no jurisdiction to deal with the first defendant’s complaint under the Club Rules and his purported suspension of the plaintiff was void and that the MC cannot the ratify the said decision.[^12] The substantive hearing of OSS 65 is fixed for hearing on 14 August 2020.

14     After OSS 65 was commenced, in a letter dated 9 July 2020, the plaintiff was informed by the Club that the MC would decide on whether to ratify or revoke the GM’s decision to suspend the plaintiff’s membership at a meeting on 21 July 2020.[^13]

15     Against this backdrop, the plaintiff filed the present application on 15 July 2020, seeking to restrain the Club from convening the MC meeting and acting on the GM’s decision to suspend the plaintiff’s membership until the determination of OSS 65. On 16 July 2020, the Duty Deputy Registrar acceded to the plaintiff’s request to fix the matter for an urgent hearing on 17 July 2020. At that point, the plaintiff had not complied with paragraph 29 of the State Courts Practice Directions and the Duty Registrar directed the plaintiff to notify the defendants of the hearing by no later than 10 a.m. on 17 July 2020.

16     Submissions were made by counsel for the plaintiff and the Club at the hearing on 17 July 2020. The first defendant conducted a watching brief.

## Issues to be determined

17     It is trite that the law applicable on whether an interim injunction should be granted is set out in _American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1975\] AC 396</span>, namely, whether there is a serious question to be tried; the adequacy of damages as a remedy; and whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interim injunction sought.

18     Having considered the evidence and counsel’s submissions, I grant the interim injunction. I set out my reasons below.

## Issue 1: Serious question to be tried

19     As part of the enquiry on whether there is a serious question to be tried, this court is not making a determination, at this interlocutory stage, on the plaintiff’s rights or whether there has been a violation of it. This is particularly relevant in this case, given that this application was made on an _ex-parte_ basis and the defendants have not had the opportunity to put forth their evidence.

20     The bar on the enquiry on whether there is a serious question to be tried is a low one. The plaintiff need only show that his case is not frivolous and vexatious, such that there is no prospect of succeeding and is bound to fail. At this interlocutory stage, it is not the court’s duty to decide difficult questions of law which call for detailed argument and mature considerations: _Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pte Ltd v Howden Insurance Brokers (S) Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 258</span> (“_Jardine_”) at \[6\].

21     Having considered parties’ submissions, I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried in the main action in OSS 65 on the true and proper construction of rules 13 and 14 of the Club Rules. The relevant excerpts of rules 13 and 14 are set out below:

> Rule 13: Conduct of members

> (a)    Members and Nominees shall observe and shall procure that their children and guests observe the Rules and Bye-Laws of the Club. Members and Nominees shall conduct and shall procure that their children and guests conduct themselves with decorum and propriety at all times within the Club. The Management is empowered to refuse entry/service or to require the member/Nominee/guest/child of a member or Nominee to leave the Club or any part thereof if the member/Nominee/guest/child of a member or Nominee shall fail to conduct himself with proper decorum or comply with the rules of the particular outlet or the Club.

> (b)    Any circulation of letters, notes or documentation whether in hard copy or in electronic medium which pertain to matters relating to, having to do with or otherwise concerning the Club, its members, Nominees or the conduct of its members or Nominees (“the circulation”) by members or Nominees without the prior written approval of the Management Committee or the General Manager may be subject to disciplinary action. Any unauthorised or unapproved circulation, whether signed or unsigned by a member or a Nominee, shall be dealt with strictly by the Management Committee, including the confiscation of all such copies, and members or Nominees who have taken part in the production, issuance, publication and distribution of the circulation may be subject to disciplinary action under Rule 13, Provided Always that this rule shall not be used to prevent any member from circulating a call for an Extra Ordinary General Meeting.

> (c)    Any complaint against the conduct of any member, Nominee or child of any member or Nominee of the Club shall be in writing and lodged with the General Manager, or in his absence the Duty Manager. The General Manager shall then proceed with one of the following courses of action within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the complaint, or such period extended by the Management Committee:

>> (i)    disregard the complaint and treat the matter closed;

>> (ii)   give a written warning to the member;

>> (iii)   suspend the member for a period not exceeding one (1) month;

>> (iv)   fine the member a sum not exceeding $1,000.00;

>> (v)    refer the matter to the Disciplinary Panel;

> (d)    the General Manager must notify the Management Committee on the decision made pursuant to Rule 13(c). The decision of the General Manager shall not take effect until it is ratified by the Management Committee. The Management Committee may ratify or revoke the General Manager’s decision and refer the matter to the Disciplinary Panel.

> …

> Rule 14

> (a)    Any member, Nominee or child of a member or Nominee (as the case may be) being dissatisfied with the decision of the General Manager or that of the Disciplinary Committee may within fourteen (14) days of being notified of such decision, appeal in writing to the Appeals Board.

> …

22     According to the plaintiff, the jurisdiction, authority or power to deal with any alleged unauthorised circulation of documents by a member is vested “exclusively and solely”[^14] in the MC under rule 13(b). The plaintiff contends that the GM’s power to deal with complaints by members pursuant to rule 13(c), read with rule 13(a), is limited to complaints pertaining to a member’s failure to “conduct \[himself\] with decorum and propriety at all times within the Club”.[^15] In the circumstances, the plaintiff submits that the GM did not have the power to suspend the plaintiff’s membership rights for one month under rule 13(b) and that decision is void and cannot be ratified by the MC.

23     In addition, rule 14(a) provides that “any member being dissatisfied with the _decision of the GM_ or that of the Disciplinary Committee may within fourteen (14) days of being notified of such decision, appeal in writing to the Appeals Board” (emphasis added).

24     The plaintiff contends that there is ambiguity as to when the 14-day period starts to run under rule 14(a) and seeks a declaration on its true and proper construction in OSS 65.[^16] The plaintiff submits that the plain reading of rule 14(a) allows a member who is dissatisfied with a decision of a GM - _albeit one that has not been ratified by the MC_ – to submit an appeal to the Appeals Board within 14 days of being notified of the GM’s decision. This will lead to a situation where the Appeals Board and MC will be deliberating on the same matter at the same time which, according to the plaintiff, would “lead to a state of chaos”.[^17] Therefore, to avoid such a situation, the plaintiff submits that the true and proper construction of rule 14(a) obliges the MC to either ratify or revoke the GM’s decision within the 14 days of the plaintiff being notified of the GM’s decision so that plaintiff is able to determine whether to appeal to the Appeals Board.[^18] According to the plaintiff, his interpretation of rules 13 and 14 is reasonable given that he would be prejudiced by any delay in the Club dealing with the matter and there would be consequential anxiety of not knowing the outcome of the MC meeting or appeal and this would affect his ability to enjoy his membership rights.[^19]

25     In the present case, as the MC did not ratify or revoke the GM’s decision by 1 April 2020 (i.e. 14 days after the plaintiff was notified by way of letter dated 18 March 2020 of the GM’s decision to suspend the plaintiff’s membership for one month), the plaintiff’s case is that the MC is _functus officio_ and no longer has the power to either ratify or revoke the GM’s decision.

26     On the other hand, the Club contends that the appeals process under rule 14(a) only operates when (and not before) the MC has ratified the GM’s decision.[^20] In addition, the Club submits that the MC is not _functus officio_ and rule 13(d) read with rule 14(a) allow the MC to determine whether to ratify or revoke the GM’s decision after 14 days from that decision.[^21]

27     The plaintiff submits that the Club’s interpretation goes against the face of the express words of rule 14(a) that any appeal must be made within 14 days of being _notified of the GM’s decision_ and not 14 days of being notified that the MC has ratified the GM’s decision.[^22] The plaintiff asserts that the Club’s interpretation requires an impermissible reading of additional words into the Club Rules when there is no basis to do so.

28     At this point, it is reiterated that the threshold to meet under the first limb of the _American Cyanamid_ test is low one. Having considered parties’ submissions, in particular \[22\] to \[27\] above, I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried in the main action in OSS 65 on the true and proper construction of rules 13 and 14 of the Club Rules. This simply means that the plaintiff’s claim cannot be said to be frivolous or vexatious to such an extent that there is no prospect of succeeding at the substantive hearing of OSS 65.

## Issue 2: Adequacy of damages as a remedy and the balance of convenience

### Adequacy of damages

29     Before granting an interim injunction, the court should first consider whether, if the plaintiff succeeds at the hearing of the main action, he would be adequately compensated by damages for any loss caused by the refusal to grant an interlocutory injunction.

30     On the balance, I find that if the Club is not restrained from calling the MC meeting, and the plaintiff subsequently succeeds in OSS 65, the plaintiff would not be adequately compensated by damages for any loss caused by the refusal to grant an interlocutory injunction.

31     The plaintiff submits that he will suffer irreparable damage if the MC meeting on 21 July 2020 were allowed to proceed. The issues that will be raised in OSS 65 deal precisely with the very point as to whether the MC can ratify or revoke the GM’s decision to suspend the plaintiff’s Club membership. If the Club proceeds to call the MC meeting notwithstanding that OSS 65 is pending, and the court subsequently finds in OSS 65 that the MC does not have the jurisdiction to revoke or ratify the GM’s decision, the plaintiff may by then have lost his right under the Club Rules to stand for the Club Elections. I elaborate on this below.

32     As mentioned above, the MC meeting was originally scheduled on 24 March 2020 but subsequently adjourned by the MC. The plaintiff’s case is that the Club has deliberately not ratified or revoked the GM’s decision since then and has chosen the most opportune time now to do so in order to prevent the plaintiff from standing in the Club Elections or to damage his candidacy.[^23] This is despite the plaintiff having made known his intention some time in 2019 to stand as a candidate in the Club Elections and the plaintiff officially notifying the MC of his intention of this by way of letter dated 30 March 2020.

33     It is not in dispute that pursuant to paragraph 5(1) read with the Schedule to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Registered Societies) Order 2020, the Club Elections has to be held on a Sunday _before 30 September 2020_. Under rule 29 of the Club Rules, at least five weeks’ notice of the Club Elections must be given to the members of the Club.

34     The plaintiff contends that if the MC ratifies the GM’s decision on 21 July 2020, he will be deprived of his right as a member of the Club to stand for elections as a candidate for president of the Club since by reason of the suspension, the plaintiff will not be allowed on the Club’s premises to campaign for himself and his team, or even to be nominated as a candidate for the elections.

35     The Club submits that damages are adequate to compensate the plaintiff. Insofar as the loss of amenities for use of the Club facilities is concerned, I agree with the Club that such loss can be quantified in monetary terms.[^24] However, with respect to the Club’s submission that the plaintiff can still stand for elections _depending on when_ the Club Elections are called this year or in the following year,[^25] this suggests that such loss in opportunity cannot be compensated by way of damages. In this regard, the Club has acknowledged that if the Club Elections are held in end-August, a potential one month suspension of the plaintiff’s membership rights from mid-July to mid-August would overlap with the Club Elections.[^26] If the MC ratifies the GM’s decision, I should also add that it is not apparent from the Club Rules whether the one-month suspension commences from the date of the MC meeting or whether the MC can set a prospective date on which the suspension should commence. In this regard, it is quite possible for a one-month suspension period (if ratified) to overlap with the Club Elections which has to be held on a Sunday before 30 September 2020.

36     During the hearing on 17 July 2020, I queried counsel whether the proverbial floodgates would be opened if an injunction is allowed in this case. My concern was whether this would result in allowing any member of a sporting and recreation club to subsequently restrain the conduct of a management committee meeting convened to consider the alleged wrongdoing of that member on the basis that the member intends to stand for upcoming club elections.

37     Having heard counsel’s submissions, I am satisfied that this would not be the case given that this injunction is granted on an _ex-parte_ basis and confined to its _specific facts_ as described in the plaintiff’s affidavits. In particular, I note the following from the plaintiff’s affidavit filed on 15 July 2020: (i) the plaintiff had made known his intention to stand for president at the Club Elections as early as 2019;[^27] (ii) the plaintiff’s allegation that the GM and MC were bias;[^28] (iii) the plaintiff’s allegation that the MC members had an interest in “crippling”[^29] his chances at the Club Elections given that they viewed the plaintiff as a competing candidate; and (iv) the four-month adjournment of the MC meeting since March 2020 vis-à-vis the potential date of the Club Elections. At this point, I stress again that only the evidence of the plaintiff was before the court and the injunction is granted on the basis of the specific version of events set out by the plaintiff. _The court did not have the benefit of the Club’s version of events_.

38     On that note, I move on to consider whether there will be any prejudice suffered by the Club if the interim injunction is granted. If it is later found in OSS 65 - as the Club asserts - that the plaintiff has abused the court proceedings to circumvent and undermine the Club Rules, the Club would be entitled to claim for costs or damages pursuant to the undertaking provided by the plaintiff. Further, if OSS 65 is dismissed in favour of the Club, the Club can then proceed to convene the MC meeting so that the MC can decide whether to revoke or ratify the GM’s decision. I am unable to see how the adjournment of the MC meeting from 21 July 2020 until the determination of OSS 65 which is fixed for 14 August 2020, is likely to prejudice the Club. Even if there is such prejudice, it will be compensable by way of damages.

### The balance of convenience

39     The court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong at trial in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish his rights at the trial, or of failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at the trial: _RGA Holdings International Inc v Loh Choon Phing Robin and another_ \[2017\] 2 SLR 977 at \[28\].

40     I find that granting the interim injunction carries the lower risk of injustice. I have considered the Club’s submission that the plaintiff’s alleged prejudice of the potential suspension and impact on his election chances requires an “exact coincidence of a multitude of factors regarding what will happen at the MC meeting and the timing of the Club Election\[s\]”.[^30] I am of the view that this is not as speculative as what the Club makes it out to be given what has been described in \[33\] to \[35\] above.

41     On the other hand, the interim injunction only requires the Club to postpone the MC meeting pending the outcome of OSS 65. While part of the reason for adjourning the MC meeting is admittedly due to the cessation of the Club’s operations during the circuit breaker period from 7 April to 1 June 2020, it bears noting that the MC meeting has already been adjourned for four months since 24 March 2020, and more than one and a half months since the end of the circuit breaker period. A further postponement of the meeting pending the outcome of OSS 65 is unlikely to prejudice the Club and maintains the _status quo_. Contrary to what the Club submits, the interim injunction does not restrain the Club from holding the MC meeting “indefinitely”.[^31]

42     I address the Club’s reliance on the case of _Wham Kwok Han Jolovan v Attorney-General and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 804</span> (“_Jolovan Wham_”) in resisting the application. In that case, the High Court had convicted one John Tan (“Tan”) for contempt by scandalising the court under section 3(1)(a) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (Act 19 of 2016) and sentenced him to a fine of $5,000, with one week’s imprisonment in default. On appeal before the Court of Appeal, counsel for Tan argued that a fine of $2,000 or more would disqualify Tan from contesting the Singapore General Elections and that Tan was hence willing to accept an objectively harsher sentence of several days’ imprisonment rather than bear a fine, since disqualification would set in only for imprisonment terms of at least one year and Tan’s imprisonment term would not cross that threshold: _Jolovan Wham_ at \[52\].

43     The Court of Appeal rejected this argument and affirmed the High Court’s sentence of $5,000 fine and reaffirmed the principle that an offender should not be allowed to choose a particular sentence that best suits his own purposes (in this case, to fulfil Tan’s political aspirations): _Jolovan Wham_ at \[61\]. The Court of Appeal made reference to _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> where the High Court had observed at \[64\], in the context of sentencing a youthful offender, that the offender should not be “place\[d\] in the position where he is able to pick and choose the terms on which he would like to be rehabilitated”.

44     In my view, it is clear that the above cases are not applicable in the present situation. The proceedings before this court are not criminal in nature; the plaintiff is not “picking and choosing a sentence” that best suits his purposes. There is no sentencing to speak of - the plaintiff’s case in OSS 65 pertains to the interpretation of the Club Rules which govern the contractual relationship between a member and the Club and as between members _inter se_. The plaintiff is simply seeking for an adjournment of the MC meeting on 21 July 2020 until the determination of OSS 65.

## Urgency of application

45     Finally, I deal with the Club’s submission that as this was an application made _ex-parte_, the plaintiff must prove that the application is urgent. If an application for an interlocutory injunction is made _ex-parte_, the court requires the plaintiff to apply promptly after becoming aware of the facts in relation to which he seeks protection. If he delays, then it is likely that he will not succeed in obtaining the injunction _ex-parte_ because his failure to move with real expedition is taken by the court as an indication of the lack or an urgent need to grant relief _ex-parte_.

46     The Club submits that the plaintiff has failed to make a timely application and that any alleged urgency was “self-induced”[^32] by the plaintiff. I disagree. The MC meeting was originally scheduled on 24 March 2020. The Club had informed the plaintiff on 6 April 2020 that the MC would be re-scheduling the MC meeting to another date. OSS 65 was filed by the plaintiff on 17 June 2020 to, _inter alia_, challenge the validity of the suspension and the MC’s right or authority to deal with the suspension. The Club submits that no interim injunction application was filed then to restrain the conduct of the MC meeting and that this was only belatedly filed on 15 July 2020.

47     In my view, there was no requirement for the plaintiff to seek an interim injunction as at the date of the filing of OSS 65 as the plaintiff did not have any indication at that time as to when the MC meeting would be held. The plaintiff had not heard from the Club on the reconvening of the MC meeting since 6 April 2020. It was only on 9 July 2020 that the Club informed the plaintiff by way of letter[^33] that the MC meeting would be held on 21 July 2020. The plaintiff thereafter filed this _ex-parte_ application six days later i.e. on 15 July 2020. There was no inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff.

## Conclusion

48     For the foregoing reasons, I find that the grant of the interim injunction carries the lower risk of injustice and allow the plaintiff’s application.

49     It is ordered that pending the determination of OSS 65, on the undertaking by the plaintiff that it shall comply with any order the court may make as to damages in case the court should hereafter be of the opinion that the Club shall have sustained any by reason of this order which the plaintiff ought to pay:

> (a)     the Club, whether by itself, its agents or servants or otherwise howsoever, be restrained, and an injunction be granted restraining it from holding a meeting of its MC to decide on whether to ratify or revoke the decision of the GM to suspend the plaintiff's membership for one month; and

> (b)     the Club, whether through its GM, the MC or any member thereof or any of its servants and/or agents, be restrained, and an injunction be granted restraining it, from acting upon the first defendant’s complaint as set out in his letter dated 3 March 2020 concerning the unauthorized or unapproved circulation of letters pertaining to the Club, or from acting upon the GM's decision to suspend the plaintiff’s membership for one month.

50     I will hear parties on costs.
