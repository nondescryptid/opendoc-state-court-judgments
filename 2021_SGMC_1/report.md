\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9903/2020/01.\]

5 January 2021

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## Introduction

1       Mr Hashim s/o Abdul Samad (“the Accused”), a 73-year-old male Singaporean had pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> “You… are charged that you, on the 29th day of September 2019 at or about 10.23 p.m., being the driver of motor car, **SHD3372R**, drove along Jurong West Street 64 towards Jurong West Street 75, Singapore, on lane 1 of 3-lane road, did cause grievous hurt to one, Samsulrudin Bin Sukor, male, Malay, Singaporean, 19 years old, who was the rider to a motorcycle, **FBB7772A**, by doing an act so **negligently** as to endanger the personal safety of others, _to wit_, by failing to keep a proper lookout when making the right turn into Jurong West Central 1 on green light only thus resulted in a collision with the said motorcyclist who was travelling straight from your opposite direction, thereby causing serious bodily injuries to the said motorcyclist and you have therefore committed an offence punishable under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code. (Cap 224, Rev Ed)”

2       I had convicted the Accused on the above charge on 7 December 2020 and had sentenced him to a fine of $4000 and disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months from 7 December 2020.

3       The Accused had paid the fine of $4,000 on 7 December 2020.

4       The Accused, being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence passed on 7 December. I hereby set out my reasons for my sentence.

## Punishment Prescribed by Law

5       The punishment prescribed under section 338(b) in the case of a negligent act, was imprisonment for a term which might extend to 2 years or with fine which might extend to $5,000, or with both.

6       Section 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Cap 276, also provided that a court before which a person was convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, could also order that person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving license for life or for such period as the court might think fit.

## Statement of Facts

7       The Accused had admitted to the following Statement of Facts without qualification:

### The parties involved

8       At the material time, the Accused was the driver of the motor car with the vehicle registration number SHD3372R (“the car”).

9       The victim was Samsulrudin Bin Sukor, a 20-year-old Singaporean. At the material time, he was the rider of the motorcycle with the vehicle registration number FBB7772A (“the motorcycle”).

### First information report

10     On 29 September 2019, at about 10.23pm, the police received a call informing them a road traffic accident between a car and a motorcycle.

### Facts pertaining to MAC-905337-2020

11     On 29 September 2019, at or about 10.13 p.m., the Accused was driving the car on lane 1 of a 3-lane road along Jurong West Street 64 towards Jurong West Street 75, Singapore. When the Accused approached the signalized cross-junction between Jurong West Street 64 and Jurong West Central 1, he made a right turn into Jurong West Central 1 on a green light. However, the Accused failed to keep a proper lookout when making the right turn into Jurong West Central 1 resulting in a collision with the victim who was riding the motorcycle and was travelling straight from his opposite direction.

12     The incident above was captured on video footage by the Accused’s in-car camera. The Prosecution had also played the video footage at the hearing before me on 7 December 2020.

### Injuries suffered by the victim

13     As a result of the accident, the victim was conveyed to National University Hospital (“NUH”). According to the medical report from NUH, dated 18 March 2020 and prepared by Dr Lynette Loo, the victim had suffered the following injuries:

> (a)     Right distal radius fracture with intra-articular extension,

> (b)     Bilateral knee lacerations,

> (c)     Abrasions over the face bilateral upper and lower limbs, and

> (d)     Small right apical pneumothorax.

14     Further, the said medical report also stated that the victim was hospitalized from 29 September 2019 to 2 October 2019, and the victim’s stay in the hospital was not extended due to factors unrelated to his injuries.

15     According to the medical certificate issued to the victim on 2 October 2019, by Dr Yeo Yi Jie, the victim was given 27 days of hospitalization leave from the 29 September 2019 to 25 October 2019.

### Condition of the motorcycle

16     The following damages were observed on the motorcycle:

> (a)     Rear motorcycle box dislodged,

> (b)     Rear motorcycle box-locking latch broken and not functional,

> (c)     Front portion broken and not functional,

> (d)     Spokes of the front wheel broken,

> (e)     Right footrest dented, and

> (f)     Scratches on the right exhaust pipe.

### Condition of the car

17     The following damages were observed on the car:

> (a)     The front windscreen was cracked on the right side, and

> (b)     Left portion of the front bumper was crumpled, ripped off, broken and not functional.

### Prevailing conditions

18     At the material time, the weather was fine, road surface was dry, the visibility was fair, and the traffic flow was light.

19     Both the car and the motorcycle also did not have any mechanical faults prior to the accident.

### Conclusion

20     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused, being the driver of the car, had driven on lane 1 of a 3-lane road along Jurong West Street 64 towards Jurong West Street 75, Singapore, and had caused grievous hurt to the victim, who was the rider of the motorcycle, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of others, by failing to keep a proper lookout when making the right turn into Jurong West Central 1 resulting in a collision with the victim who was travelling straight from the Accused’s opposite direction, and thereby causing serious bodily injuries to the victim. The Accused had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Edition.

## Antecedents

21     The Accused was untraced with any criminal antecedents. However, I noted that the Accused had committed a large of traffic offences over the years all of which were compounded, some with demerit points issued against the Accused:

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

22     The Prosecution, in their oral submission, had sought for a fine of $4,000 with a disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months.

23     The Prosecution had submitted that based on the sentencing framework as set out in the case of _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ \[2018\] SLR 83 (“_Tang Ling Lee_”), the present case would fall under Band 1 of the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework. The Prosecution was of the view that the Accused’s culpability was low as he was negligent failing to keep a proper lookout when making the right turn into Jurong West Central 1 resulting in a collision with the victim who was travelling straight from the Accused’s opposite direction. As for the harm caused, the Prosecution was also of the view that the level of harm caused was low. The Prosecution also noted that the Accused had pleaded guilty and he had stopped to render assistance.

24     Given the above, the Prosecution was of the view that view that the custodial threshold had not been crossed and the Prosecution had sought a fine of $4,000.

25     On the issue of disqualification, the Prosecution referred me to the case of _PP v Ong Heng Chua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 388</span> (“_Ong Heng Chua_”) where at \[58\], the court had observed that disqualification was generally in the region of 12 to 36 months. Given the circumstances of the present case, the Prosecution was of the view that a disqualification of 12 months was reasonable.

## Defence’s submission on sentence

26     The Defence had sought a fine of $3,000 and a disqualification for a period of 11 months. The Defence pointed out that the Accused had been a taxi driver for more than 20 years and he was untraced for any criminal offences. The Defence also stated that the Accused had apologised to the victim.

27     On the issue of disqualification, the Defence had requested for 11 months’ disqualification because if the disqualification ordered was less than 12 months, the Accused could apply for his driving license to be reinstated after the period of disqualification without having to retake the driving test. The Defence informed me that if the period of disqualification ordered was 12 months or more, the Accused would need to retake his basic theory and driving test in order to get back his driving license. Given the Accused’s age, there was a high chance that the Accused would not be able to pass his driving test if he was required to re-take the driving test in the future. This, in turn, would cause hardship on his family as the Accused needed his driving license to continue to work as a taxi driver to support his family.

28     I also noted that the Accused had also tendered his own written mitigation plea whereby he had requested for a disqualification period of less than 12 months for the same reasons as stated by his counsel. The Accused had also stated in his own written mitigation that he was the sole breadwinner and he had a clean driving record for 20 over years.

## My Decision

### Sentencing consideration for a section 338(b) offence

29     The main sentencing consideration for a section 338(b) offence was deterrence, both general and specific.

30     The editors of Practitioners’ Library – Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Court[^1]1 at \[page 317\] had commented:

> **2 Commentary**

> These offences encompass a wide range of criminal behaviour, and the range of sentences is accordingly broad. In sentencing, the material considerations would be whether the act falls within the negligence or rashness limb and the consequences of the act. The traditional view has been that a term of custody would be appropriate where the act falls under the rashness limb and a fine where the act falls under the negligence limb; see _Ngian Chin Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 655</span>. Nevertheless, in an appropriate case, an offender charged under the negligence limb may still be sentenced to imprisonment. A term of custody was upheld in _Lim Poh Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 428</span> where ‘the negligence of the \[offender\] was sustained over a period of time in the context of a doctor-patient relationship where the patient was at the mercy of the doctor’s care and competence’. A short one-week custody was imposed in _Deng Tin Beng v PP_ (MA 23/90/01, unreported) (summarised below) where the negligence posed a risk to the safety or lives of many persons. Given that the sections have now been amended to provide specifically for imprisonment and fines for each limb, such a fact-based approach to sentencing should henceforth be taken. Courts should no longer feel constrained to take fines for negligence and imprisonment for rashness as the starting point.

31     In _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> (“_Tang Ling Lee_”), See Kee Oon J, in hearing the appeal had at \[23\] provided some guidance in the form of a basic analytical framework outlining presumptive sentencing ranges for such offences to help foster more consistency and predictability in this area of sentencing practice

32     The suggested sentencing framework comprised three broad sentencing bands, within which the severity of an offence and hence the appropriate sentence to be imposed was be determined based on:

> (a)     The harm caused by the offence (where the degree of harm caused would generally refer to the nature and degree of the grievous bodily injury caused to the victim(s); and

> (b)     The culpability of the offender (where the degree of culpability would generally refer to the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions, and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act ie the manner of driving)

(see _Tang Ling Lee at_ \[ 25\]).

33     See Kee Oon J at \[26\] had also discussed the considerations/factors which were relevant to section 338(b) offences:

> _“26_      _A key ingredient of a s 338(b) offence is that the negligent act must have endangered human life or personal safety. The fact that grievous bodily injury has been caused is itself indicative that the harm occasioned to the victim is not slight or minor. In this regard, the period of hospitalisation leave or medical leave would be a relevant consideration in so far as it represents a medical professional’s opinion as to the length of time required for treatment of the injuries and for the victim to resume his daily activities. Nevertheless, the period of hospitalisation or medical leave is a rough-and-ready proxy for the severity of the victim’s injuries at best, as the assessment of time required for treatment and subsequent recovery may vary from case to case and may also depend on an interplay of various other circumstances, including the opinion of the medical professional as well as the personal characteristics of the victim._

> _27_      _In PP v Aw Tai Hock <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span>, the High Court stated (at \[37\]–\[40\]) that the factors that affect culpability for dangerous driving offences under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) would generally include:_

>> (_a_)     _the manner of driving ie, how dangerous the driving was and the extent of danger to road users posed by the offender’s conduct;_

>> (_b_)     _the circumstances of driving which might have increased the danger to road users during the incident; and_

>> (_c_)     _the offender’s reasons for driving._

> _28_      _I consider that the first two factors in particular are also relevant to s 338(b) offences. In relation to the manner of driving, some examples of situations where culpability would be increased include speeding, drink driving, sleepy driving, driving while under the influence of drugs, driving while using a mobile phone, flouting traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road, involvement in a car chase or a racing competition, or exhibiting poor control of his vehicle. These examples are largely drawn from cases such as Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v PP <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“Suse Nathen”) (at \[27\]); PP v Hue An Li <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 661</span> (“Hue An Li”) (at \[82\]–\[92\]); PP v Koh Thiam Huat <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> (at \[41\]); and Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span> (at \[56\]). These circumstances in relation to the offender’s manner of driving are aggravating due to the increased danger to road users posed by such conduct._

> _29_      _Second, the circumstances surrounding the incident should also be taken into account. This would include instances where the offender drives without a licence or while under disqualification. In Suse Nathen (at \[28\]), it was considered that there may be increased risk where the offender drives:(a) during rush hours when the volume of traffic is heavy; (b) within a residential or school zone; (c) a heavy vehicle that is more difficult to control and requires a quicker reaction time; or (d) where he intends to travel a substantial distance to reach his destination. These circumstances may heighten the danger posed to road users._

> _30_      _Where some of the culpability-increasing factors arise, it is of course entirely possible and indeed likely that additional charges may be preferred and proceeded with. In such circumstances, the respective sentences upon conviction ought to be calibrated as appropriate, avoiding loading or double-counting of the culpability-increasing factors.”_

34     Bearing the above considerations in mind, See Kee Oon J then laid down the following applicable presumptive sentencing ranges where the accused claimed trial:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.04%"> <col width="45.54%"> <col width="36.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Category</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Circumstances</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Presumptive Sentencing Range</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to two weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">More than 2 weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

35     See Kee Oon J at \[32\] had also indicated that in sentencing an offender for a road traffic case under section 338(b), the court should undertake a two-step inquiry:

> _“(a_)     _First, the court should identify the sentencing band within which the offence in question falls, and also where the particular case falls within the applicable presumptive sentencing range, having regard to the twin considerations of harm and culpability, in order to derive the starting point sentence._

> (_b_)     _Second, further adjustments should then be made to take into account the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, which may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable presumptive sentencing range._

> _Examples of relevant mitigating factors may include an offender’s timely plea of guilt, stopping to render assistance to the victim(s), a good driving record, and evidence of remorse. Relevant aggravating factors, on the other hand, may include efforts to avoid detection or apprehension and the existence of similar antecedents, which are indicative of persistent or prolonged bad driving.”_

36     See Kee Oon J also clarified at \[33\] that presumptive sentencing ranges were merely starting points which sought to guide the exercise of sentencing discretion, and they were not rigid or immutable anchors. In the final analysis, the appropriate sentence to be imposed would be the product of a fact-sensitive exercise of discretion, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. For avoidance of doubt, an appropriate period of disqualification should also be ordered.

37     In the present case, having considered the facts of the case, I noted that the victim had suffered a right distal radius fracture with intra-articular extension, knee lacerations, abrasions over the face bilateral upper and lower limbs, and a small right apical pneumothorax. The victim was hospitalised for 3 days and given 27 days hospitalization leave which was inclusive of his 3 days stay in the hospital. Given the nature of the injuries suffered by the victim and that he had suffered a simple fracture, I was of the view that the harm caused in the present case was low.

38     As for the culpability of the Accused, I noted that the accident was a result of his failing to keep a proper lookout when making the right turn into Jurong West Central 1 resulting in a collision with the victim who was travelling straight from the Accused’s opposite direction. As such, I was of the view that the Accused’s culpability would fall in the low range.

39     Given the above, I was of the view that the present should fall under Category 1 of the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework.

40     I also considered the Accused’s early plea of guilt and the fact that he had stopped to render assistance to the victim. I had also considered the Accused’s driving history and the list of driving offences which he had compounded. Given all these, I was of the view that a reasonable sentence would be a fine of $4,000 and I accordingly fined the Accused $4,000 for the section 338(b) offence.

### On the issue of the Accused’s driving records

41     In the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ong Heng Chua and another appeal_ **\[**2018\] 5 SLR 388 (“_Ong Heng Chua_**_”_**), See Kee Oon J had at \[39\] held that an accused’s driving offences which had been compounded could be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:

> _“39_      _I held in PP v Koh Thiam Huat <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span> (“Koh Thiam Huat”) that an offence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“RTA”) (or its subsidiary legislation) which has been compounded can be taken into account for sentencing purposes, and I explained the rationale for doing so at \[51\]–\[60\] of the judgment. In the present case, the offender did not dispute that his record of compounded offences could properly be taken into account. This case nevertheless affords an opportunity to further examine why an offender’s record of compounded offences ought to be a relevant sentencing consideration in so far as road traffic violations are concerned._

> _40_      _Like composition schemes for minor regulatory offences, the composition scheme for road traffic offences was created to deal with the efficient disposition of less serious traffic violations. This purpose was alluded to in Parliament by the then Minister for Home Affairs and Second Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar, in the second reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill on 30 August 1985, during which he explained that the rationale for increasing the maximum composition amount was so that “most road offences could be compounded by the Traffic Police instead of being referred to the court” and “\[o\]nly the more serious offences will be referred to the courts”…_

> _41_      _Although no further proceedings are to be taken against the driver in respect of the offence on payment of the composition sum under s 135(1A) of the RTA, this does not mean that a composition carries no consequence whatsoever and can be conveniently ignored. This is well illustrated by the following examples. A prior composition sets the basis for a higher composition fine to be imposed for subsequent offending, such as in the case of illegal parking offences (see “Targeted measures to deter illegal parking” dated 22 December 2014 on the Land Transport Authority of Singapore website (last accessed on 23 April 2018)). (which are compoundable offences under Road Traffic (Composition of Offences) Rules (S 110/1986) read with Road Traffic Rules (S 171/1981) and s 135(2) of the RTA). Under s 110A(5) of the RTA, it is specifically provided that an offer of composition is to be treated as if the driver had been convicted of that offence for the purposes of determining whether the driver had been convicted of a relevant offence._

> _42_      _From what I have outlined in the preceding paragraph, this plainly demonstrates that composition is a relevant indicia of a person’s driving record. It is wholly illogical to suggest that merely because offences have been compounded, the offender’s slate of traffic violations is somehow wiped clean irrespective of the number of compounded offences he has amassed. If the offender’s record reveals a slew of compounded traffic offences, he is no less a “repeat offender” with a poor driving record in the eyes of the court. Put simply, an offender’s driving record remains a highly relevant sentencing consideration, even if the record consists entirely of compounded offences. If his slate is truly spotlessly clean or merely contains a few isolated blemishes, then the court would justifiably pay no heed to it._

> _43_      _As I have explained in Koh Thiam Huat (\[39\] supra at \[55\]), the issue of the relevance of composition of a traffic offence for sentencing purposes is separate and distinct from the question of whether composition amounts to an acquittal. The offender may have no prior court convictions but his driving record remains potentially relevant as a sentencing consideration notwithstanding that. All the more so when the offender in question has accumulated 16 compounded offences with corresponding demerit points._

> _44_      _I am also conscious of at least two decisions at the High Court level which establish that composition of an offence does not amount to an implied admission of guilt (Re Lim Chor Pee <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 117</span> (“Re Lim Chor Pee”) and Rajamanikam Ramachandran v Chan Teck Yuen <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 259</span>). The judgment of L P Thean J on behalf of the court in Re Lim Chor Pee was cited with approval by Yong Pung How CJ in PP v Lim Niah Liang <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 702</span> (“Lim Niah Liang”), at \[18\]. Yong CJ reiterated the need to scrupulously observe the principle of autrefois acquit so that an offender who has compounded an offence is not tried again for the same offence. This point is uncontroversial but of no relevance to the present discussion._

> _45_      _What is pertinent is that in Lim Niah Liang, Yong CJ went on to hold (at \[23\]) that given the relatively straightforward nature of littering offences, where most offenders are observed and thence caught red-handed by enforcement officers, it would “not be inconceivable” that composition of such offences amounts to an admission of guilt. I have set out my views in Koh Thiam Huat (at \[57\]–\[60\]) as to why I found these observations instructive. Traffic enforcement cameras, especially those recording vehicle speeds or capturing vehicles beating red light signals, are hardly new or unfamiliar technologies in our enforcement landscape. They have become increasingly sophisticated and more reliable and prevalent over time. Turning to the present case, the offender had compounded 12 speeding offences and one offence of failing to conform to a red light signal out of 16 compounded offences in all. In all likelihood, he would have had no viable defence to any of these 13 enumerated offences, since he was probably quite literally caught in the act, whether by an enforcement officer or through enforcement technologies which recorded his violation(s). Unsurprisingly, he did not attempt to suggest otherwise either in the proceedings below or before me._

> _46_      _An accused person’s bad driving record is relevant in the case of an offence involving driving because it reflects his attitude towards road safety as well as his unwillingness to comply with the law. Such a record reflects a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law, especially in the case of the present offender, for he has a long string of compositions for traffic violations. The need for specific deterrence indicates that a more severe penalty is warranted. In PP v Aw Tai Hock <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span> (“Aw Tai Hock”), Steven Chong JA echoed my sentiments in Koh Thiam Huat (at \[60\]) in this regard and accepted that the court may take into account a compounded offence to better give effect to this need (at \[27\] of Aw Tai Hock)._

> _47_      _Moreover, s 228(2)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) stipulates that the Prosecution’s address on sentence may include “any relevant factors which may affect the sentence”. A bad driving record as demonstrated by a long history of compounded traffic offences is incontrovertibly one such relevant consideration. Taking into account the accused’s driving history allows for a more holistic approach in assessing the level of specific deterrence necessary in the particular case. It would also better serve the need for general deterrence and retribution where appropriate._

> _48_      _The District Judge was conscious of the offender’s bad driving record but he observed that this had to be viewed in the context of him being a taxi driver for a period of 39 years (at \[26\] of GD (\[10\] supra)). This may have been no more than a passing remark simply commenting on the relative frequency of the commission of driving offences measured against the offender’s lengthy driving experience. However, it would appear that the District Judge was in fact implying that some leniency could be accorded to the offender because he was a taxi driver who had spent long hours and many years on the road and for whom there was perhaps a higher probability of committing traffic violations compared to other drivers. With respect, the District Judge had taken an unjustifiably lenient view in determining the weight attached to the offender’s driving record. Working as a taxi driver as a means of one’s livelihood arguably means that one should take even more care while driving since others’ lives and personal safety are in one’s hands. There is no cogent basis to hold taxi drivers to a lower standard of care or allow them more leeway as far as requirements to abide by traffic rules are concerned_.”

### On the issue of disqualification

42     On the issue of disqualification, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the general range for disqualification in section 338(b) cases were between 12 months to 3 years.

43     See Kee Oon J had taken the same position in _Ong Heng Chua_ at \[58\]:

> _“58_      _A brief survey of various reported s 338(b) road traffic cases shows that the disqualification periods imposed are generally within the range of 12 months to three years. At the lower end of the range are cases such as PP v Sia Chee Han <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 18</span> (“Sia Chee Han”) and PP v Zhang Xiang Guo <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 98</span> (“Zhang Xiang Guo”), where a 12-month disqualification period was imposed. At the other end of the range are cases such as Kaleeswaran Sudarsan v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 67</span> (“Kaleeswaran Sudarsan”), PP v Lim Gim Chye <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGMC 60</span> (“Lim Gim Chye”) and PP v Koh Saw Khim <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGMC 38</span> (“Koh Saw Khim”) where a disqualification period of three years was imposed (on appeal in the case of Koh Saw Khim). The offenders in those cases at the lower end of the disqualification range were often untraced, as in Sia Chee Han and Zhang Xiang Guo. On the other hand, the offenders in cases at the higher end of the disqualification range often had traffic offence records, as in Kaleeswaran Sudarsan (with three previous compositions, including careless driving under r 29 of the Road Traffic Rules compounded shortly before the commission of his offence), Lim Gim Chye (with one composition for speeding in 2016, one composition for failing to obey traffic sign in 2013 and two compositions in 1999 for speeding and using a mobile telephone while driving) and Koh Saw Khim (with a conviction of causing death by rash or negligent act)._

> _59_      _I would also refer to Tang Ling Lee (\[17\] supra) in this regard. There, a disqualification period of two years was imposed, where the culpability of the offender was moderate to high and the harm caused was substantial. The substantial harm and moderate to high culpability warranted a two year disqualification even with the offender’s unblemished driving record._

> _Relevant considerations_

> _60_      _Sundaresh Menon CJ discussed the general sentencing objectives underpinning disqualification orders in Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v PP <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> at \[13\]–\[14\]:_

>> _A disqualification order combines three sentencing objectives: punishment, protection of the public and deterrence (see Peter Wallis gen ed, Wilkinson’s Road Traffic Offences (Sweet & Maxwell, 20th Ed, 2001) at para 4.412; Kow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore (Academy Publishing, 2009) at paras 32.150–32.159) …_

>> _Where an offence reflects a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users and a lack of personal responsibility, there is a public interest in taking such a driver off the roads for a substantial period of time. The aims of deterrence are also served by sounding a stiff warning that such drivers can expect a lengthy disqualification order. The disqualification order should therefore increase in tandem with the severity of the offence, whether or not it is also accompanied by a substantial fine or period of imprisonment._

> _These principles are equally applicable to all categories of cases where disqualification ought to be considered._

> _61_      _The most important sentencing principles engaged in disqualification orders are the protection of society, because the objective of disqualification orders is to prevent future harm that the offender may cause to the public, and deterrence, because such orders deprive offenders of the freedom to drive. In line with these principles, greater weight should be placed on the culpability of the offender in the commission of the offence as well as his driving record. These reflect how much of a danger he poses to society, and are also indicative of the degree of specific deterrence necessary. The precedents, as set out above at \[53\]–\[59\], are generally consistent with this analysis.”_

44     In the present case, although the Accused’s culpability and the harm caused were both at a low level, considering his bad driving record, while giving due weight to his plea of guilt, remorse and his rendering of assistance, I was of the view that a disqualification period of 12 months was not manifestly excessive given the lengths of disqualifications imposed in the cases discussed in _Ong Heng Chua_.

### Conclusion

45     In the premises, having considered all the circumstances of the case, I accordingly imposed a fine of $4,000 and a disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months from 7 December 2020 on the Accused.
