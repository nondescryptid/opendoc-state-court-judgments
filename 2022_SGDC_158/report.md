Civil Procedure – Striking out – Whether an insurance claim can be struck out on the basis that the claimant, in breach of a Scott v Avery clause, had failed to refer a dispute under the insurance policy to arbitration within the stipulated deadline

\[LawNet Editorial Note: The appeal in HC/RAS 19/2022 was dismissed by the General Division of the High Court on 29 August 2022.\]

25 July 2022

### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       According to a condition in an insurance policy, a claim under the policy shall be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not be recoverable if the claim is not referred to arbitration within 12 months of the insurer having disputed the claim. An insured commenced a third-party action against the insurer more than 12 months after the latter had disputed the claim. Can the insurer apply for the action to be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court? Or is the insurer’s remedy limited to only applying for a stay of the action so that the claim can be referred to arbitration?

2       These issues were raised in Registrar’s Appeal No. 38 of 2022 (“**RA 38**”). RA 38 is an appeal by the 1st Defendant (“**the Appellant**”) in District Court Suit No. 1887 of 2019 (“**DC 1887**”) against a Deputy Registrar’s decision to allow their action in DC 1887 against their insurer, the Third Party in DC 1887 (“**the Respondent**”), to be struck out vide DC/SUM 4986/2021 (“**SUM 4986**”).

3       I dismissed RA 38 after hearing arguments. The Appellant has appealed against my decision. I now give the full grounds for my decision.

## Background

### The Incident

4       In 2016, a fire and an explosion occurred at a food stall in a food centre located at 60 Gul Lane (“**the Incident**”). The operators of the food stall (“**the Plaintiffs**”) suffered injuries as a result of the Incident.

5       The Appellant was the contractor for the gas system and maintenance works at the food stall. At the material time, the Appellant had a public liability insurance policy – policy no. XXX (“**the Policy**”) – with the Respondent. Soon after the Incident, the Appellant made an insurance claim against the Respondent, and the latter instructed their loss adjusters, Crawford & Company, (“**Crawford**”) to investigate into the claim.

### The dispute

6       Crawford found that the Incident arose because of a corroded pipe which belonged to, and was serviced by, the Appellant. As a result of this finding, Crawford informed the Appellant on 22 October 2018 that the Policy did not cover the Incident. The Appellant was referred to Exclusion 7(d) of the Policy (“**the Exclusion Clause**”) which stipulated the following:

> The indemnity expressed in this policy shall not apply to: \[…\] liability in respect of injury, illness, loss or damage caused by or in connection with or arising from \[…\] any commodity, article or thing supplied, repaired, altered or treated by or to the order of the Insured.

7       The Appellant disagreed with the position taken by Crawford/the Respondent. On 30 June 2019, their solicitors requested the Respondent to “restore/resume” the Appellant’s coverage (“**the Appellant’s Request**”). On 11 March 2020, Crawford informed the Appellant that the Respondent maintained their position.

### DC 1887

8       In the meantime, the Plaintiffs had commenced DC 1887 in 2019 and had sued their landlord and occupier of the food centre (“**2nd Defendant**”) as well as the Appellant over the Incident. The Appellant entered appearance in DC 1887 only in November 2020.

### Third party proceedings

9       In November 2020, the Appellant initiated third-party proceedings against the Respondent. The Appellant claimed, among others, that they were entitled to be indemnified by the Respondent in respect of their liabilities, if any, to the Plaintiffs under the Policy.

### Condition 11 and SUM 4986

10     The Respondent disputed the Appellant’s claim. Apart from the Exclusion Clause, the Respondent had also relied on Condition 11 of the Policy (“**Condition 11**”) as to why they were not liable. Condition 11 – which is in the form of what is sometimes known as a _Scott v Avery_ clause – stipulates the following (_Note. The “Society” refers to the Respondent_):

> All differences arising out of this Policy _shall be referred_ to the decision of an Arbitrator to be appointed in writing by the parties in difference or if they cannot agree upon a single Arbitrator to the decision of two Arbitrators one to be appointed in writing by each of the parties within one calendar month after having been required so to do by either of the parties or in case the Arbitrators do not agree of an Umpire appointed in writing by the Arbitrators before entering upon the reference. The Umpire shall sit with the Arbitrators and preside at their meetings and _the making of an award shall be condition precedent to any right of action against the Society_. **If the Society shall disclaim liability to the Insured for any claim hereunder** **_and such claim shall not_** **_within twelve calendar months from the date of such disclaimer_** **_have been referred to arbitration under the provisions herein contained_** **then the claim shall for all purposes** **_be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder_****.** \[emphasis added\]

11     According to the Respondent, the final sentence in Condition 11 (in bold above) made it clear that all differences or disputes arising out of the Policy were to be referred to arbitration within 12 months of their disclaimer of liability under the Policy. This meant that the Appellant ought to have referred the dispute regarding whether the Respondent was liable under the Policy to arbitration by 11 March 2021 – i.e., 12 months after the Respondent declined to change their position despite the Appellant’s Request. The Appellant had failed to do so.

12     The Respondent further contended that the Appellant could have a right of action against them in DC 1887 only if two conditions were met. First, the Appellant must show that they had submitted the dispute (as to whether the Respondent was liable under the Policy) to arbitration. Second, the Appellant must also show that they had obtained a favourable arbitral award. Neither condition was met in this case.

13     Accordingly, the Respondent applied (vide SUM 4986) to strike out the Appellant’s claims against them on the grounds that these claims –

> (a)     disclosed no reasonable cause of action: O 18 r 19(1)(a) of the Rules of Court,

> (b)     were scandalous, frivolous or vexatious: O 18, r 19(1)(b), and/or

> (c)     were otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court: O 18 r 19(1)(d).

14     The Deputy Registrar allowed SUM 4986.

## The Appellant’s submissions

15     A critical hurdle to the Appellant’s claim against the Respondent is Condition 11. To overcome this hurdle, the Appellant made the following submissions before the Deputy Registrar and me:

> (a)      **Commencement of Adjudication Argument.** First, Condition 11 was not applicable because the Respondent had given notice of their dispute to the Appellant’s claim only on 26 November 2020. By this time, DC 1887 had already commenced. In the circumstances, the dispute ought to be resolved via adjudication rather than arbitration to ensure consistency of findings and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (b)      **Proper Recourse Argument.** Second, despite the Appellant’s breach of Condition 11, striking out was not an available remedy. Instead, the proper recourse for the Respondent was (i) to apply for the Appellant’s claim in DC 1887 to be stayed under s 6(1) of the Arbitration Act 2001 (“**the Arbitration Act**”), and (ii) to apply for an extension of time under s 10(2)(b) of the Act to begin arbitration (given that the deadline for referral to arbitration had lapsed). This approach, according to the Appellant, is consistent with _Trinity Construction Development Pte Ltd v Sinohydro Corp Ltd (Singapore Branch)_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 1039</span> (“**_Trinity Construction_**”). In that case, the High Court had stayed the respondent’s action instead of striking it out.[^2]

> (c)      **Substantive Merit Argument.** Finally, O 18 r 19 imposed a “high standard” for striking out a claim. A claim could only be struck out under if it lacked substantive merit, and not because of a procedural lapse – such as the Appellant’s failure to comply with Condition 11 as in the present case. There is no precedent of a claim having been struck out because of a party did not comply with a _Scott v Avery_ clause such as Condition 11.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

## My Decision

16     In dismissing the appeal, I had delivered brief remarks explaining why I did not agree with the Appellant’s submissions (“**Brief Remarks**”). These remarks are in **Annex A.**

17     In these grounds of decision, I wish to emphasise and elaborate further on the following points.

### Proper Recourse Argument

18     I will begin with the Appellant’s Proper Recourse Argument – i.e., submission that if the Deputy Registrar’s decision was upheld, it would be “a truly remarkable and unprecedented outcome”. This submission was based on the Appellant’s inability to locate a case where a claim had been struck out at an interlocutory stage because court proceedings had been commenced in breach of an arbitration clause.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

19     I had explained why the argument was untenable in my Brief Remarks at \[10\]. To expand further, the fact that the Appellant could not locate a precedent where a striking out application had been allowed in circumstances similar to the present is neither here nor there. The absence of such a precedent can be due to various reasons – including the possibility that no insured party had felt that it was tenable to sue his insurer when the deadline for referring a claim to arbitration had already expired and the claim was thus deemed abandoned under the policy.

20     What is more important is whether Condition 11 is clear and certain in its intent and application. In this regard, I find that the last sentence in Condition 11 (see \[10\] above) is crystal clear – it states unequivocally that if the Respondent disclaims liability to the Appellant’s claim, and the claim is not referred to arbitration within 12 months from the date of such a disclaimer, then the Appellant’s claim “_shall for all purposes be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be recoverable_” under the Policy.

21     It bears noting Condition 12 of the Policy immediately goes on to stipulate that –

> **The due observance and fulfilment** of the terms, provisions, **conditions** and endorsement of this Policy **by the Insured** insofar as they relate to anything to be done or complied with by him and the truth of the statements and answers in the proposal made by the **Insured shall be conditions precedent to any liability of the Society**.

> \[emphasis added\]

22     On a plain reading, Condition 11 is fatal to the Appellant’s claim. The Appellant had no reasonable cause of action against the Respondent under the Policy since they (the Appellant) had failed to comply with Condition 11 which provided for the contractually agreed mechanism for any dispute between the parties under the Policy.

23     Before me, the Appellant did not submit how and why the parties’ intent, as expressed in Condition 11, could be disregarded. In my judgement, there is nothing in either the Policy or the Arbitration Act to show why such an intent can and should be overridden.

24     The Appellant’s Proper Recourse Argument would have far more persuasive if they could locate a precedent where our courts had in fact dismissed a striking out application in circumstances similar to the present case – i.e., one where the insurance policy contains a clause just like Condition 11.

25     In my Brief Remarks at \[10(d)\], I had stated that contrary to the Appellant’s submission, I did not find anything in _Trinity Construction_ to show that a dispute _must_ be resolved by way of arbitration where such an option had already lapsed due to the conduct of the defaulting party. The facts in that case are very different from the present.

> (a)     In _Trinity Construction_, both parties had initially engaged in arbitral proceedings to resolve a dispute between them. However, one of the parties (“**D**”) disputed the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction and refused to elect between arbitration and court proceedings when requested to do so by the other party (“**P**”). It was in these circumstances that P commenced court proceedings against D to resolve the dispute. On D’s application to strike out P’s claim, the High Court decided to stay the court proceedings instead – on the basis that (i) P itself had been willing to arbitrate and recognised its obligation to do so and (ii) a stay of proceedings would not prejudice P as it could avail itself of all its rights should the stay be lifted.

> (b)     In the present case, the Appellant had been unwilling to resolve their dispute with the Respondent through arbitration. This is evident both from the fact that they had declined to commence arbitral proceedings within the deadline set in Condition 11, as well as their insistence during submissions before me that a court, rather than an arbitral tribunal, was the best forum to resolve the dispute.

> (c)     In my judgement, the Proper Recourse Argument, if accepted, would have caused prejudice to the Respondent. The requirements and deadline stipulated Condition 11 would be superfluous – since the Appellant (who had rejected arbitration and breached the deadline in Condition 11) could frustrate the Respondent’s rights under the Policy by applying belatedly for the dispute to be referred to arbitration. Finality and certainty are important in commercial transactions, and contractual terms freely agreed by the parties must be upheld and enforced. It is for these reasons that I was unimpressed by the Appellant’s submission that they were agreeable to have the dispute arbitrated if I were to be of the view that the Appellant’s claim against the Respondent “should proceed by way of arbitration instead”.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

### Substantive Merit Argument

26     Next, I turn to the Appellant’s submissions that the powers to strike out a claim was never intended to be applied to a case where a respondent had failed to comply with procedural requirements such as those stipulated in Condition 11.

27     I have dealt with these submissions in my Brief Remarks at \[11\]. Suffice to note, the Appellant did not produce any authority to support their startling submissions. It is not uncommon for courts to strike out claims by parties who had their right to sue due to their breach of procedural requirements. A good example is that of a claimant who takes out an action _outside_ the limitation period. It is well established that such claims can, and have been, struck out on the basis that they are frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of process: see _Singapore Civil Procedure 2020_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 2020) at \[18/19/10\] (page 361) and \[18/19/14\] (page 364).

## Conclusion

28     I am mindful that the Appellant is dissatisfied with the Respondent’s position that they are not liable for the Appellant’s claim. Specifically, the Appellant disagreed with the Respondent’s view that Exclusion 7(d) was applicable, especially when, according to the Appellant, the Respondent had allowed similar claims by the Appellant in the past.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

29     In my judgement, the Appellant ought to have referred such a dispute to arbitration in accordance with Condition 11. That condition stipulated a reasonable deadline for the Appellant to make the referral – within 12 months of the Respondent disclaiming their liability under the Policy. The Appellant had failed to do so and had thus lost their right to pursue their claim under the Policy. It is not just for the Appellant to re-write or disregard the terms of Condition 11 – by having their dispute with the Respondent litigated in DC 1887. There is also no basis for the Appellant to submit that the dispute can be referred to arbitration pursuant to s 6 and s 10 of the Arbitration Act – when those provisions are clearly not applicable in the present case.

30     The Respondent’s striking out application centred on the application of Condition 11. It did not require any minute or protracted examination of documents and facts of the case in order to see whether the Appellant had a cause of action against the Respondent. Plainly they did not. It is undisputed that Condition 11 is applicable in the present case and that the Appellant had failed to comply with the condition.

31     For the reasons contained above and in my Brief Remarks, it is plain and obvious that the Appellant’s claim cannot possibly succeed.

32     Accordingly, I dismissed the Appellant’s appeal.

**DC/SUM 4986/2021**

**DC/RA 38/2022**

## BRIEF REMARKS

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Appellant to set aside a Deputy Registrar’s decision to strike out their claim against the Respondent in DC/DC 1887/2019 (“**DC 1887**”).

2       The Appellant’s claim is based on an insurance policy (policy no. XXX) between the Appellant and New Guan Hong Trading Pte Ltd (“**NGH**”) (collectively as the insured) on the one hand, and the Respondent (as the insurer) on the other (“**the Policy**”).

3       At the heart of this appeal is this – Does the Appellant have a valid claim against the Respondent given the undisputed evidence that Condition 11 of the Policy has not been complied with?

## Condition 11

4       According to Condition 11 of the policy[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) –

> All differences arising out of this Policy _shall be referred_ to the decision of an Arbitrator to be appointed in writing by the parties in difference or if they cannot agree upon a single Arbitrator to the decision of two Arbitrators one to be appointed in writing by each of the parties within one calendar month after having been required so to do by either of the parties or in case the Arbitrators do not agree of an Umpire appointed in writing by the Arbitrators before entering upon the reference. The Umpire shall sit with the Arbitrators and preside at their meetings and _the making of an award shall be condition precedent to any right of action against the Society_. **If the Society shall disclaim liability to the Insured for any claim hereunder** **_and such claim shall not_** **_within twelve calendar months from the date of such disclaimer_** **_have been referred to arbitration under the provisions herein contained_** **then the claim shall for all purposes** **_be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder_****.**

> \[emphasis added\]

5       On a plain reading of Condition 11 –

> (a)     The Appellant needs to satisfy two requirements before they can have a right of action against the Respondent under the Policy. First, any difference between the parties arising out of the Policy must be referred to arbitration. (One such difference would obviously be whether the Respondent is liable to the Appellant under the Policy.) Second, an arbitral award must have been made against the Respondent.

> (b)     If the Respondent disputes the Appellant’s claim, then the latter must refer their claim to arbitration within twelve calendar months thereafter. If the Appellant fails to do so, then under Condition 11, they shall be deemed to have abandoned the claim and the claim shall not thereafter be recoverable.

## The Respondent’s submissions

6       According to the Respondent, the Appellant’s claim in DC 1887 ought to be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court. It was submitted that the Appellant did not have a reasonable cause of action given that they had failed to satisfy the requirements in Condition 11. Furthermore, the Appellant’s claim was initiated in contravention of Condition 11 and was thus frivolous, vexatious and/or an abuse of process.

## The Appellant’s submissions

7       To overcome Condition 11, the Appellant made the following submissions before the Deputy Registrar and me:

> (a)      **Commencement of Adjudication Argument.** First, Condition 11 was not applicable because the Respondent gave notice of their dispute to the Appellant’s claim only on 26 November 2020, by which time DC 1887 had already commenced. In the circumstances, the dispute ought to be resolved via adjudication rather than arbitration to ensure consistency of findings and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> (b)      **Proper Recourse Argument.** Second, despite the breach of Condition 11, striking out was not an available remedy. Instead, the proper recourse for the Respondent was (i) to apply for the Appellant’s claim in DC 1887 to be stayed under s 6(1) of the Arbitration Act 2001 (“**the Act**”), and (ii) to apply for an extension of time under s 10(2)(b) of the Act to begin arbitration given that the deadline for referral to arbitration had lapsed. This approach, according to the Appellant, is consistent with _Trinity Construction Development Pte Ltd v Sinohydro Corp Ltd (Singapore Branch)_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 3 SLR 1039</span> (“**_Trinity Construction_**”). In that case, the High Court stayed the respondent’s action instead of striking it out.[^9]

> (c)      **Substantive Merit Argument.** Finally, O 18 r 19 imposed a “high standard” for striking out a claim. A claim could only be struck out under that provision if it lacked substantive merit, and not because of a procedural lapse – such as the Appellant’s failure to comply with Condition 11 in the present caae. There is no precedent of a claim having been struck out because of a party did not comply with a _Scott v Avery_ clause such as Condition 11.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

## My decision

8       I am unable to agree with the Appellant’s submissions. My reasons are as follows.

9       First, regarding the Commencement of Adjudication Argument –

> (a)     The evidence clearly showed that the Appellant knew that the Respondent were disputing the claim _way before_ DC 1887 had commenced. DC 1887 was commenced in June 2019. About _eight months before_ that, i.e., on 22 October 2018, the Respondent’s loss adjustors had already informed NGH unequivocally that the claim fell outside the scope of the Policy.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) On 30 June 2019, the Appellant’s solicitors wrote to the Respondent to request the latter to “restore/resume” the policy coverage. It is clear from the following passages in that letter that the Appellant knew that the Respondent had denied liability under the policy:[^12]

>> (i)       “We understand that _you have repudiated your policy_ liability to our clients.” \[emphasis added\]

>> (ii)       “_In a letter dated 22.10.2018 by your loss adjusters_, M/s Crawford & Company International Pte Ltd (“Crawford”), various exceptions in your insurance contract were cited _as the basis for your repudiation_.” \[emphasis added\]

>> (iii)       “The exceptions _you rely on_ clearly cannot stand in light of this overriding Clause.” \[emphasis added\]

> (b)     It bears noting that after receiving the letter by the Appellant’s solicitors, the Respondent’s loss adjustor and the Respondent wrote to the Appellant on 11 March 2020 and 26 November 2020 respectively – each time denying the Appellant’s claim.

> (c)     The Respondent submitted that the Appellant ought to have commenced arbitration to resolve the dispute in accordance with Condition 11 by 11 March 2021 (i.e., 12 months after the 11 March 2020 rejection) or at the latest, 26 November 2021 (i.e., 12 months after the 26 November 2020 rejection).[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) I agreed. In my view, the Appellant had ample time and ought to have referred the dispute to arbitration.

> (d)     The Appellant submitted that the dispute should be resolved via adjudication given that DC 1887 had already commenced. I find this submission to be wholly without merit. Condition 11 is essentially a dispute resolution clause. It is an expression of the parties’ _agreement_ that any dispute regarding the Respondent’s liability under the Policy must be resolved in the first instance via arbitration. It is well-established that courts are slow to assume jurisdiction over a matter where the parties had agreed to refer to arbitration: _Tjong Very Sumito v Antig Investments Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 732</span> at \[28\]; _Ling Kong Henry v Tanglin Club_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 871</span> at \[25\]. The Appellant should be held to their end of the bargain.

> (e)     I am of the view that there is now no risk of multiplicity of proceedings or of inconsistent finding for the simple reason that the Appellant had already lost their right for their claim to be arbitrated. For completeness, I should add that even if the Appellant had commenced arbitration proceedings within the stipulated timeliness, they had failed to show why there would be such risks.

10     I next turn to the Proper Recourse Argument which I find to be disingenuous.

> (a)     It bears recalling that it is the Appellant who is claiming that the Respondent is liable under the Policy. The Respondent has denied this. In the circumstances, the onus is on the Appellant to refer the dispute for arbitration, not the Respondent.

> (b)     This view accords with Condition 11, which stipulates that –

>> … **If the Society shall disclaim liability** to the Insured for any claim hereunder **and such claim shall not** within twelve calendar months from the date of such disclaimer **have been referred to arbitration** under the provisions herein contained then the claim shall for all purposes be **deemed to have been abandoned** and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> Condition 11 states that a failure to refer the insured’s claim to arbitration will result in the claim being “deemed to have been abandoned”. Clearly, such an irrebuttable presumption will only make sense if the insured fails to refer a claim for arbitration after knowing that the insurer has disputed liability.

> (c)     As for the Appellant’s reliance on s 6 and s 10 of the Act, I find this to be misconceived. Section 6(1) states –

>> Where any party to an arbitration agreement institutes any proceedings in any court against any other party to the agreement in respect of any matter which is the subject of the agreement, any party to the agreement **may**, at any time after filing and serving a notice of intention to contest or not contest and before delivering any pleading (other than a pleading asserting that the court does not have jurisdiction in the proceedings) or taking any other step in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to that matter.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> On a plain reading, s 6(1) confers on a party to an arbitration agreement _a discretion_ whether to apply for proceedings in breach of the agreement to be stayed (“**aggrieved party**”). The provision does not stipulate that the aggrieved party must do so. Section 10 – which vests in courts the power to extend time for beginning arbitral proceedings – is engaged only where the aggrieved party chooses to make an application under s 6(1) in the first place.

> (d)     Contrary to the Appellant’s submission, I do not find anything in _Trinity Construction_ to show that a dispute _must_ be resolved by way of arbitration where such an option had already lapsed due to the conduct of the defaulting party. In my view, the ends of justice would not be served by compelling the Respondent to take on the burden and expenses of going through arbitration in light of the clear wording in Condition 11.

11     Finally, I will now explain why I reject the Substantive Merit Argument.

> (a)     First, the Appellant’s submission that O 18 r 19 is not applicable to procedural breaches in an arbitration agreement is unsupported by the plain language of the provision and case law. There is nothing in either the Rules of Court or the Act that precludes the Respondent from applying to strike out a claim commenced in breach a _Scott v Avery_ clause.

> (b)     Second and in any event, whether the Appellant has a substantive cause of action against the Respondent is to be determined in accordance with the terms of the Policy.

> (c)     In this regard, Condition 11 specifically states that the Appellant had no right of action unless they first comply with the requirements in the condition. It is only where (i) the Appellant had brought their claim within the prescribed period _and_ (ii) an arbitral award had been made in their favour that the Appellant can be said to have a cause of action against the Respondent.

> (d)     It is well established that the effect of a _Scott v Avery_ clause is that unless and until an arbitral award is made, the claimant does not have a cause of action: _Board of Trade v Cayzer, Irvine & Co_ <span class="citation">\[1927\] 1 AC 610</span> at 615; _Freshwater v Western Australian Assurance Company, Limited_ <span class="citation">\[1933\] 1 KB 515</span> at 523; _Jones v Birch Brothers, Limited (Licenses and General Insurance Company, Limited, Third Parties)_ <span class="citation">\[1933\] 2 KB 597</span> at 611 _Chitty on Contracts_ at \[31-061\] and \[34-047\]. In _Lim Kitt Ping Lynette v People’s Insurance Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 914</span> (“**_Lim Kitt Ping_**”), the High Court had the occasion to consider a clause similar to Condition 11. The High Court accepted that the defendant insurer in that case could plead in their defence that a decision by the arbitrator was a condition precedent to its liability to make payment under the Policy, and since no arbitral decision had been obtained by the insured before the action was commenced, the insurer was under no liability to the insured at all: at \[19\].

> (e)     In the present case, the text in bold in Condition 11 as reflected in \[4\] above makes it abundantly clear that the Respondent would not be liable under the Policy if the requirements in the condition are breached. Any other view of Condition 11 would render the phrases (i) “the making of an award shall be condition precedent to any right of action against the \[Respondent\]” and (ii) “\[the Appellant’s failure to bring a claim within the prescribed period\] shall for all purposes be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder” otiose.

> (f)     Condition 12 of the Policy further emphasises the point that strict compliance with the policy terms by the Appellant is prerequisite to establishing liability on the part of the Respondent. Condition 12 states that –

>> **The due observance and fulfilment of the terms, provisions, conditions** and endorsement **of this Policy by the Insured insofar as they relate to anything to be done or complied with by him** and the truth of the statements and answers in the proposal made by the Insured **shall be conditions precedent to any liability of the Society**.

>> \[emphasis added\]

## Conclusion

12     In summary, the Appellant had failed to show why Condition 11 is inapplicable. Having failed to comply with Condition 11, the Appellant clearly has no cause of action and their claim is plainly unsustainable. It is an abuse of process for the Appellant to maintain their claim in disregard of the dispute resolution mechanism contained in Condition 11. This appeal is plainly without merit and is accordingly dismissed.

13     These are my brief grounds of decision. I will supplement these grounds, if and when the need arises.
