Limitation of Actions – When time begins to run

Limitation of Actions – Particular causes of action – Tort – Personal injuries – Knowledge

Statutory interpretation – Construction of statute

3 May 2019

### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       This case turns on the hitherto unconsidered question of whose knowledge is relevant for the purposes of ascertaining the limitation period where an injured person passes away within the time limited for commencing an action.

## Background facts

2       The facts in this case are uncomplicated. On 3 December 2013, Mr Musoling bin Faraj (the “Injured Person”), a pedestrian crossing a five-lane road, was knocked down by Mr Chellappan Chivadasan (the “Driver”), who was driving a taxi (“the Accident”). For reasons unrelated to the Accident, the Injured Person passed away on 16 January 2015 and the Driver passed away on 7 April 2016.

3       Mr Syed Almagdad Bin Syed Faraj (“the Plaintiff”), who is the brother and administrator of the estate of the Injured Person, subsequently commenced proceedings on 2 February 2018 in MC Suit No 2016 of 2018 (“the Suit”), claiming damages against the estate of the Driver. The defendant (“the Defendant”) to the Suit is the motor vehicle insurers of the Driver’s taxi, which has been appointed as the personal representative of the Driver’s estate.

## The present application

4       The application in MC Summons No 285 of 2019 was brought by the Defendant to strike out the Suit in its entirety (“the Striking Out Application”). The main thrust of the application is that the Plaintiff’s claim is time-barred, having exceeded the three-year limitation period provided for a claim in negligence for personal injuries under s 24A(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed) (“the Limitation Act”). The Defendant therefore contends that the Suit is frivolous and/or vexatious and/or otherwise an abuse of process under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”).

5       Having heard counsel on 2 April 2019, I directed parties to consider two issues, which were in my view determinative of the Striking Out Application:

(a)     first, whether the requisite knowledge for bringing an action for damages, as provided under s 24A(2) of the Limitation Act (“s 24A(2)”), refers to the knowledge of the Injured Person or that of the Plaintiff (“the first issue”); and

(b)     second, what are the relevant factors in determining what would constitute knowledge which a plaintiff is reasonably expected to acquire within the meaning of s 24A(6) of the Limitation Act (“the second issue”).

6       As would be apparent from my reasons below, given my decision on the first issue, the second issue is moot in the Striking Out Application.

## Interpretation of “plaintiff” in s 24A(2)

7       The material provision to the dispute is s 24A(2)(_b_) of the Limitation Act, which reads as follows:

An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person, shall not be brought after the expiration of —

….

(_b_)    3 years from the earliest date on which **_the plaintiff_** _has the knowledge_ required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury …

\[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

8       The dispute between the parties is a straightforward one. The Plaintiff submits that the relevant party, whose knowledge is relevant is, as the section suggests, the plaintiff in the action. In other words, in this case, it is the Plaintiff administrator’s knowledge that is determinative of when the three-year time period commences.

9       The Defendant, on the other hand, argues that the relevant knowledge is that of the injured person, _ie_, the knowledge of the Injured Person is determinative of the action. Adopting this interpretation would mean that the Suit is time-barred if the Injured Person had known or ought to have known of the cause of action three years before the Suit was commenced on 2 February 2018.

10     For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the Plaintiff’s interpretation is the correct one. It is therefore not necessary for me to decide when the Injured Person knew or ought to have known of the facts giving rise to the Suit.

#### Principles of statutory interpretation

11     As this is a case involving statutory interpretation, I am guided by the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Public Prosecutor v Lam Leng Hung and others_ (“_Lam Leng Hung_”). The approach towards purposive interpretation under s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IA”) has been summarised as involving the following three steps (see _Lam Leng Hung_ at \[67\], citing _Attorney-General v Ting Choon Meng and another appeal_ (“_Ting Choon Meng_”) at \[59\]):

(a)     first, determine all the possible interpretations of the text, having regard not just to the provision in question in isolation but also to the context of that provision within the written law as a whole;

(b)     second, determine the legislative purpose or object of the statute, which may be discerned from the language used in the statute, and also by resorting to extraneous material in certain circumstances; and

(c)     third, compare the possible interpretations of the text against the purposes or objects of the statute.

12     It must be emphasised here that the first port of call in statutory interpretation would be for the court to decipher the _plain and ordinary meaning_ of the text of the legislative provision (see _Lam Leng Hung_ at \[71\]).

#### Ordinary meaning of “plaintiff”

13     I start the analysis by considering the text of s 24A of the Limitation Act (“s 24A”), which I reproduce in full below for easy reference:

**Time limits for negligence, nuisance and breach of duty actions in respect of latent injuries and damage**

**24A.—(1**)    This section shall apply to any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or of a provision made by or under any written law or independently of any contract or any such provision).

(2)    An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person, shall not be brought after the expiration of —

(_a_)    3 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or

(_b_)    3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff has the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury, if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (a).

(3)    An action to which this section applies, other than one referred to in subsection (2), shall not be brought after the expiration of the period of —

(_a_)    6 years from the date on which the cause of action accrued; or

(_b_)    3 years from the earliest date on which the plaintiff or any person in whom the cause of action was vested before him first had both the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant damage and a right to bring such an action, if that period expires later than the period mentioned in paragraph (a).

(4)    In subsections (2) and (3), the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury or damage (as the case may be) means knowledge —

(_a_) that the injury or damage was attributable in whole or in part to the act or omission which is alleged to constitute negligence, nuisance or breach of duty;

(_b_) of the identity of the defendant;

(c)    if it is alleged that the act or omission was that of a person other than the defendant, of the identity of that person and the additional facts supporting the bringing of an action against the defendant; and

(_d_)    of material facts about the injury or damage which would lead a reasonable person who had suffered such injury or damage to consider it sufficiently serious to justify his instituting proceedings for damages against a defendant who did not dispute liability and was able to satisfy a judgment.

(5)    Knowledge that any act or omission did or did not, as a matter of law, involve negligence, nuisance or breach of duty is irrelevant for the purposes of subsections (2) and (3).

(6)    For the purposes of this section, a person’s knowledge includes knowledge which he might reasonably have been expected to acquire —

(_a_)    from facts observable or ascertainable by him; or

(_b_)    from facts ascertainable by him with the help of appropriate expert advice which it is reasonable for him to seek.

(7)    A person shall not be taken by virtue of subsection (6) to have knowledge of a fact ascertainable only with the help of expert advice so long as he has taken all reasonable steps to obtain (and, where appropriate, to act on) that advice.

14     Specifically, I am required in this case to interpret the term “plaintiff” in s 24A(2) of the Limitation Act. In _Lam Leng Hung_, Andrew Phang JA described the “ordinary meaning” of a word or phrase as the (at \[76\]):

… ‘proper and most known signification’ … \[_ie_, the ordinary meaning\] is that which _comes to the reader most naturally_ by virtue of its **_regular or conventional usage_** _in the English language_ and in the light of the **_linguistic context_** _in which that word or phrase is_ used. \[emphasis in original\]

15     On this note, the regular or conventional usage of the term “plaintiff” would generally refer to the party who commences a legal action in court. For instance, Bryan A Garner (ed in chief), _Black’s Law Dictionary_ (Thomson Reuters, 10th Ed, 2014) defines “plaintiff” as “\[t\]he party who brings a civil suit in a court of law” (at p 1336). Similarly, “plaintiff” is defined in _The Oxford English Dictionary_ vol XI (Clarendon Press, 2nd Ed, 1989) as “\[t\]he party who brings a suit into a court of law; a complainant, prosecutor; opposed to defendant” (at pp 956–957). Applying this interpretation, the Plaintiff administrator would be the “plaintiff” referred to in s 24A(2) as he is the person who had commenced the Suit.

16     In addition, the section, read as a whole, supports the same interpretation. In _Ting Choon Meng_, the majority in the Court of Appeal held that when construing a statutory provision, both its text and its context are important; what is required in this exercise is the “integration of text and context” (at \[18\]; \[original emphasis omitted\]).

17     In this vein, I must highlight the language used in s 24A(2):

An action to which this section applies, where the damages claimed consist of or include damages in respect of _personal injuries to the plaintiff or_ **_any other person_**, shall not be brought after the expiration of —

…. \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

18     The reference to injuries suffered by “any other person” in s 24A(2) clearly envisages that the reference to the “plaintiff” in the same can include someone other than the injured person. In other words, the “plaintiff” need not necessarily be the injured person; he could be bringing the proceedings in respect of injuries suffered by another.

19     If the Defendant’s submission that “plaintiff” in s 24A(2) can only refer to the injured person is correct, this would render the reference to “any other person” nugatory. This is unlikely because as has been noted by the Court of Appeal, Parliament “does not legislate in vain; the court should therefore endeavour to give significance to every word in an enactment” (see _Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General_ at \[38\], citing _JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax_ at \[43\]).

#### Legislative purpose of s 24A

20     Having ascertained the ordinary meaning of the section, I turn now to consider the legislative purpose of the provision. This may be discerned from the language used in the provision and from extraneous material where appropriate (see _Lam Leng Hung_ at \[167\]).

21     In identifying the legislative purpose of the statute, a distinction is to be drawn between the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted and the general purpose underlying the statute as a whole. As noted by the Court of Appeal (see _Lam Leng Hung_ at \[68\], referring to Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon’s observations in _Ting Choong Meng_ at \[60\]–\[61\]):

… \[T\]he purpose behind a particular provision may be distinct from the general purpose underlying the statute as a whole. In appropriate cases, the specific purpose behind a particular provision should be separately considered. For instance, _different sections of a particular statute may target different mischiefs_, and to that extent the general object of a statute may cast little, if any, light on the meaning of specific provisions. … \[emphasis in original\]

22     It is trite that the general purpose of the Limitation Act is to discourage plaintiffs from “sleeping on their actions” (see Choong Yeow Choy, _Law of Limitation_ (Butterworths Asia, 1995) at p 4). In this regard, s 6 of the Limitation Act (“s 6”) stipulates a time limit of six years for various actions, including actions based on contract or tort.

23     Notwithstanding that, this general time limit in s 6 is expressly stated as being “subject to this Act”. One such qualification is s 24A, which qualifies this general time limit for actions based on “negligence, nuisance or breach of duty” (see s 24A(1) of the Limitation Act).

24     The effect of s 24A(1) and (2) of the Limitation Act is that it creates two special time limitations for _personal injury claims_: a default three-year limitation period from the accrual of the cause of action, and an **_extended_** three-year period from the date of acquisition of relevant _knowledge_ for the institution of proceedings against the defendant.

25     Based on the text of ss 6 and 24A, the legislative purpose of s 24A appears to be to prevent actions from being time-barred where the plaintiff did not have relevant knowledge of the action at the date on which the cause of action accrued. This legislative purpose is therefore consistent with the ordinary meaning of the “plaintiff” being the person who commences the legal proceedings.

#### Extraneous material shedding light on the legislative intent behind s 24A

26     Turning now to consider the relevant extraneous materials, the most relevant material in this case are the statements made by the then-Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar (“Prof Jayakumar”), during the Second Reading of the Limitation (Amendment) Bill in 1992 (_ie_, when s 24A was first introduced) (“the 1992 amendments”) (see _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (29 May 1992) vol 60 (“_Parliamentary Debates_”) at cols 31–32):

…

This amendment is necessary because under the present law, the limitation period for legal actions runs from the time the damage actually occurred **_even if the plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known about the damage_**. This can, of course, cause injustice and problems, especially in building construction cases where latent defects may not be discoverable until after the limitation period has expired. In such cases, the plaintiff, or the aggrieved party, is then left without any legal recourse.

This was highlighted in an English case in 1983 where the United Kingdom House of Lords held that the equivalent law was "harsh and absurd" and "unjustified in principle that a cause of action should be held to accrue before it was possible to discover the damage". However, the House of Lords felt constrained by the law to apply that principle to an action. Prior to this case, it was generally thought that in negligence cases other than personal injuries, the cause of action would accrue only when damage was discoverable.

The House of Lords, aware of the difficulties created by the judgment, recommended that legislation be passed to overcome the undesirable effects of its judgment. In England, an amendment as regards personal injuries cases had already been made in 1975. Subsequently, the United Kingdom Latent Damage Act 1986 was passed to remove the problem relating to other negligence cases.

Sir, the **_Bill before us amends the Limitation Act along the lines of the United Kingdom Limitation Act 1980_** and the United Kingdom Latent Damage Act 1986. What it does is to **_extend the limitation periods_** for personal and non-personal injury claims by providing an **_alternative starting date_** for the limitation period, ie, the date the aggrieved person has knowledge of the damage. The limitation period would be computed from the date that expires later. It also seeks to balance the interest of potential defendants by providing that no action may be brought after 15 years from the date of the breach of duty even though the damage or injury has not and could not be discovered.

\[emphasis added\]

27     It is apparent from the above _Parliamentary Debates_ that s 24A was introduced to provide for the specific situation where the “plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known about the damage”. The purpose of this amendment was to ensure that a plaintiff would not be barred from having recourse to legal action as was the position under the erstwhile law where time started to run from the accrual of the cause of action, regardless of whether the plaintiff knew about the facts giving rise to the action (see Limitation (Amendment) Act 1966 (Act 7 of 1966) which introduced the previous s 6(4)). Section 24A was thus introduced with the intent of avoiding this “injustice” by _extending_ the limitation period in certain cases based on an alternative starting date for the limitation period, _ie_, from “the date of knowledge”.

28     It is also clear from Prof Jayakumar’s observations that Parliament had intended to amend the law to be in line with that of the UK legislation and common law developments (see _Parliamentary Debates_ at col 32; see also _Yan Jun v Attorney-General_ (“_Yan Jun_”) at \[25\] and \[59\]). On this point, it is common ground between the parties that under s 11(5) of the Limitation Act 1980 (c 58) (UK) (“the UK Limitation Act”), where an injured person had died within three years from the date of his knowledge, the limitation period would be either three years from the date of death or three years from the date of the _personal representative’s knowledge_, whichever is later.

29     For ease of comparison, I set out the relevant parts of s 11 of the UK Limitation Act:

_Actions in respect of wrongs causing personal injuries or death_

**11.—(1**)    This section applies to any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty (whether the duty exists by virtue of a contract or of provision made by or under a statute or independently of any contract or any such provision) where the damages claimed by the plaintiff for the negligence, nuisance or breach of duty consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to **_the plaintiff or any other person_**.

(2)    None of the time limits given in the preceding provisions of this Act shall apply to an action to which this section applies.

(3)    An action to which this section applies shall not be brought after the expiration of the period applicable in accordance with subsection (4) or (5) below.

(4)    Except where subsection (5) below applies, the period applicable is three years from–

(_a_)    the date on which the cause of action accrued; or

(_b_)    the date of knowledge (if later) of the person injured.

(5)     **_If the person injured dies before the expiration of the period mentioned in subsection (4) above_**, the period applicable as respects the cause of action surviving for the benefit of his estate by virtue of section 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 shall be three years from-

(_a_)    the date of death; or

(_b_)     **_the date of the personal representative's knowledge_**; whichever is the later.

\[emphasis added\]

30     It is also noteworthy here that s 11(1) of the UK Limitation Act uses the same language of “plaintiff or any other person” as s 24A(2) (see \[17\]–\[18\] above).

31     I pause here to refer to the Court of Appeal decision in _Yan Jun_. In that case, the issue was whether the meaning of the phrase “breach of duty” under s 24A(1) of the Limitation Act encompassed all torts. Although _Yan Jun_ concerned the interpretation of a different term in s 24A, the Court of Appeal’s approach to interpreting the provision is instructive. The Court of Appeal held that a purposive interpretation of s 24A(1) led to the conclusion that “breach of duty” would encompass all torts such that the same limitation period would apply to both intentional and non-intentional torts (at \[60\]–\[61\]). What is material for the present purposes is that the Court of Appeal, in reaching this determination, closely analysed the legislative provisions and case law in England, noting that “the 1992 amendments … followed a line of legislative and common law developments in England” (at \[60\]).

32     Adopting a similar analysis, the position in England (before 1992) would similarly be helpful to shed light on the proper interpretation to be accorded to the reference to the term “plaintiff” in s 24A(2). In this regard, the Solicitor-General for England and Wales, Mr Peter Archer, noted as follows during the parliamentary debates where amendments were proposed to the equivalent legislation in the UK (see _Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) – House of Commons_ (18 June 1975) vol 893 at cols 1643–1644):

Perhaps one can summarise the existing law in this way … If the victim knew the position more than three years before his death his claim is barred and neither his personal representatives nor his dependants can resurrect it. If he died unaware of the facts or was aware of them less than three years before his death, **_they_** \[_ie_, the personal representatives\] **_have three years from his death or three years from when they first learned of the relevant facts, whichever is the later_**. I have stated that in concise terms, perhaps by contrast with some of my earlier comments, but _that position is to be found over a fairly wide-ranging group of authorities_. It is not found in any one place. \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]    

33     I emphasise here that it was against this state of the law in England that the Limitation Act was amended during the 1992 amendments to include s 24A. If Parliament had instead decided to depart from this entrenched position in England, one would expect this to have been highlighted by Prof Jayakumar during the _Parliamentary Debates_. To the contrary, Prof Jayakumar stated that the 1992 amendments were “along the lines of the \[UK Limitation Act\]”, highlighted the need to avoid “injustice” in cases where the “plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known about the damage” and referred to an English case which found that the erstwhile rule was “harsh and absurd” (see _Parliamentary Debates_ at cols 31–32, cited above at \[26\]).

34     From a holistic reading of the Limitation Act as well as the _Parliamentary Debates_, it is clear to me that Parliament’s intent in the 1992 amendments was to extend the limitation period in cases where the plaintiff was, for some reason, unaware of the injuries at the time of accrual of the cause of action. This was achieved by using “knowledge” as the lynchpin for kick-starting the limitation period, _ie_, by stipulating that the time limited for the action would commence three years from the date of knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the relevant injury (see s 24A(2)(_b_) of the Limitation Act).

35     Against this backdrop, if the legislative intention is to allow the limitation period to only commence upon _knowledge_ of the cause of action, it follows that this is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the “plaintiff” being the person bringing the action in court. As such, the _Parliamentary Debates_ serve the purpose here of confirming the contextual ordinary meaning of the term “plaintiff” discussed above (see s 9A(2)(_a_) of the IA and _Lam Leng Hung_ at \[71\]).

36     If the reference to “plaintiff’ in s 24A(2) exclusively covered the injured person instead, in a case where the injured person passes away either without knowledge or before the expiration of three years from the date of his knowledge, the intention of the section would be betrayed where the personal representative had no similar knowledge of the action. The personal representative and the injured person are two different legal individuals or entities and the injured person’s knowledge cannot necessarily be imputed to the personal representative.

37     Since it is the personal representative who brings the action in court upon the death of the injured person, it follows that he has to be the relevant “plaintiff” whose knowledge is material for the purposes of the limitation period in s 24A(2). Any contrary interpretation would bar an honest personal representative, with no prior knowledge of the action, from commencing the action – this would be contrary to the legislative intention discussed above at \[34\].

38     There is also no good reason for the law to hypothetically continue counting the time limited for an action with the reference point being based on the knowledge of a _deceased individual_; it would be illogical and unprincipled to do so. Further, in cases where it is suggested that the injured person had knowledge of the cause of action before his demise, there could be practical difficulties in ascertaining, as a matter of fact, _when_ the injured person knew about the action since he would have already passed away by the time the defence of limitation is raised. In other cases where the injured person did not have such knowledge, when does the three-year time period commence? Would it be from the date of the _accident_ or the date of _death_? Neither position is in line with the legislative object for extending the limitation period in s 24A from the date of _knowledge_.

39     One possible objection to the construction I have adopted is that it extends the time limited for bringing an action, engendering uncertainty for potential defendants. While the potential effect of this construction cannot be denied, it is only likely to be relevant in exceptional cases and that too only for well-justified reasons – the contrary construction of shutting out the case even where the personal representative had not been “sleeping on” the action (see \[22\] above) would be an unprincipled conclusion to reach.

40     More pertinently, this was a point that was alive to Parliament during the 1992 amendments. Prof Jayakumar had noted that the law “seeks to **_balance_** the interest of potential defendants” by providing for a long-stop limitation period of 15 years from the date of the breach of duty _regardless_ of whether knowledge of the action has or ought to have been acquired by that time (see _Parliamentary Debates_ at col 32, cited above at \[26\]; \[emphasis added\]). This amendment was introduced in 24B(1) of the Limitation Act.

41     The Defendant’s strongest argument in support of its contention that the law in Singapore is only concerned with the knowledge of the injured person is by relying on the following observations made by the Law Reform Committee in 2007 in its report on the Review of the Limitation Act (see Law Reform Committee, Singapore Academy of Law, _Report of the Law Reform Committee on the Review of the Limitation Act (Cap 163)_ (February 2007) (Chairman: Charles Lim Aeng Cheng) (“_LRC Report_”) at paras 164 and 167):

164    In the UK, s 11(5) of the UK Limitation Act 1980 provides that if the claimant dies before the expiry of the limitation period in respect of his claim, the period applicable, as regards the cause of action surviving for the benefit of his estate, is three years from the later of the date of his death and the date when his personal representative first has knowledge of the facts relevant to the cause of action. When s 24A of the Singapore Limitation Act was introduced in 1992 based on the UK Limitation Act 1980, the provisions which dealt with estate claims (s 11(5) to (7)) were not included. _In Singapore, therefore, the limitation period applicable to the estate for claiming damages for wrongful death continues to run as though the claimant had not died. The death of the claimant has no impact on the expiry of the limitation period._

…

167    … _We think the UK approach of extending, in the event of death of the claimant, the limitation period to three years from death or knowledge of the personal representative, whichever is later, is to be preferred_. We recommend the adoption in Singapore of s 11(5) to (7) of the UK Limitation Act 1980 (new s 6D(4), (5) and (6)).

\[emphasis added\]

42     In short, the _LRC Report_ had adopted the view that Singapore law was different from the UK on this point. With all due respect, I decline to adopt these views of the learned authors in the _LRC Report_. I make three observations in this regard:

(a)     First, it appears that the plain language of s 24A(2) of the Limitation Act, _ie_, the reference to the “plaintiff or any other person”, and the effect of this language, was not considered in the _LRC Report_.

(b)     Second, the _LRC Report_ does not discuss in this analysis the legislative intent behind Parliament’s introduction of s 24A, specifically that Parliament had chosen to use “knowledge” as the lynchpin for kick-starting the limitation period to avoid “injustice” in cases where the “plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known about the damage”.

(c)     Third, the _LRC Report_ is, at best, only a secondary material. And there are other secondary materials, pointing with equal force to the opposite position. For instance, the _Halsbury’s Law of Singapore_ vol 18 (LexisNexis Singapore, 2017 Reissue) states that s 24A is in “_pari materia_” with s 11 of the UK Limitation Act (at para 240.064, fn 2).

43     For all these reasons, I come to the ineluctable conclusion that it is not Parliament’s intention to only consider the knowledge of the injured person to the exclusion of the personal representative in a case where the injured person had passed away within the time limited for commencing an action.

44     This is precisely the situation in the present case. Even assuming the Injured Person had knowledge of the action on the date of the Accident (_ie_, 3 December 2013), he passed away on 16 January 2015, which is within three years of the date of knowledge. It follows that for the first issue, the “plaintiff” in s 24A(2) refers to the Plaintiff administrator in this case. This means that the time limited for the action starts to run three years from the date of the Plaintiff’s knowledge.

## Knowledge of the Plaintiff

45     Consequent to my determination on the first issue, the Plaintiff argues that the three-year period can only begin from the date of his appointment as an administrator on 23 January 2017. This would mean that the action is not time-barred as the Suit was commenced on 2 February 2018.

46     I disagree with the Plaintiff’s submission. Such an interpretation is neither supported by the plain meaning of the text nor the purpose of the provision. Since the legislative design under s 24A(2) is to start counting time only upon the plaintiff’s knowledge, what is critical is only the relevant date on which this knowledge was acquired; not the _capacity_ in which the knowledge was acquired.

47     Further, the Plaintiff’s interpretation that only knowledge acquired _qua_ administrator is to be considered has no support even under the UK Limitation Act. Section 11(6) of the UK Limitation Act reads as follows:

For the purposes of this section “personal representative” includes any person who is or has been a personal representative of the deceased, including an executor who has not proved the will (whether or not he has renounced probate) but not anyone appointed only as a special personal representative in relation to settled land; and _regard shall be had to any knowledge acquired by any such person while a personal representative_ **_or previously_**_._ \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

As described in a leading text, the effect of the emphasised words above is that a personal representative “cannot escape the three-year rule by pleading that he acquired relevant knowledge before becoming a personal representative” (see Andrew McGee, _Limitation Periods_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2010) at para 8.007).

48     This position is sound. If time was to only run from the date of the personal representative’s appointment, it would be possible for personal representative to “sleep on” the action despite knowing of the facts giving rise to it. This would be contrary to the general object of the Limitation Act (see \[22\] above).

49     The effect of the above is that the Suit could still be time-barred if the Plaintiff had the relevant knowledge of the facts giving rise to the Suit before 2 February 2015 (_ie_, three years before the Suit was commenced was on 2 February 2018). However, based on the affidavit evidence available, the question of _when_ the Plaintiff knew or ought to have reasonably known about the matter remains a disputed question of fact. In other words, the answer to the question of whether the Plaintiff had such knowledge before 2 February 2015 is not “clear and obvious and the contrary unarguable” (see for instance the decision in _Tan Yang Chai v Kandang Kerbau Hospital Pte Ltd and others_ at \[28\]). The Suit is for the same reason neither legally nor factually unsustainable (see _The “Bunga Melati 5_” at \[39\]). I therefore find that the relevant threshold for striking out the Suit under O 18 r 19 of the ROC is not met in the present case.

## Conclusion

50     For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the Striking Out Application, leaving the issue of limitation to be decided at trial if necessary.

51     It leaves me now to hear parties on costs.
