\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9041/2019/01.\]

21 May 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

1       Mr Jolovan Wham, a Singaporean currently 39 years of age, organised an event entitled “Civil Disobedience and Social Movement” on 26 November 2016 (the “**Event**”). The Event was held at The AGORA, an indoor event venue located at Midview City along Sin Ming Lane, and was open to the public. Among the scheduled speakers was a non-citizen, one Joshua Wong. Three days before the Event, the defendant was advised by the police that a permit was required to organise the Event. The defendant did not apply for a permit, and proceeded with the Event without a permit.

2       The defendant was subsequently interviewed by the police in the course of an investigation into the matter. A written statement was recorded from him. He refused to sign the statement.

3       Two charges were subsequently brought against the defendant. One charge was for organising a public assembly without a permit, and another charge for refusing to sign the statement. He claimed trial to both charges. After a brief hearing (in which much of the relevant facts were not in dispute), the defendant was found guilty and convicted. On 21 February 2019 he was sentenced to a total fine of $3,200. He filed the present appeal against the conviction and sentence the same day.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charges

5       The first charge against the defendant was for organising a public assembly without a permit, an offence under s 16(1)(a) of the _Public Order Act_, Chapter 257A (2012 Rev Ed) (“**POA**”):

(MAC-912063-2017) (the “**POA Charge**”)

You \[...\] are charged that you, on the 26th day of November 2016, did organise a public assembly from about 4.00 pm to about 6.00 pm at “The AGORA”, located at 28 Sin Ming Lane, #03-142, Midview City, Singapore 573972, to publicise the cause of “civil disobedience and democracy in social change”, in which one Joshua Wong Chi-Fung, a non-citizen of Singapore, gave a speech by real-time transmission and in respect of which no permit has been granted under Section 7 of the Public Order Act, Chapter 257A (2012 Rev Ed), where such permit is required, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 16(1)(a) of the said Act.

6       Section 16(1)(_a_) POA provides:

16.—(1)    Each person who organises a public assembly or public procession —

(a)     _in respect of which no permit has been granted_ under section 7 or no such permit is in force, where such permit is required by this Act;

\[...\]

shall be guilty of an offence and shall \[...\] be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000.

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

7       The second charge was for refusing to sign a statement recorded by a police officer in the course of investigations, an offence under s 180 of the _Penal Code_ (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”):

(MAC-912064-2017) (the “**Penal Code Charge**”)

You \[...\] are charged that you, on the 20th day of December 2016, at or about 10.48 am, at Block D, 391 New Bridge Road, #03-11, Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore, did refuse to sign a statement made by you, _to wit_, the statement recorded under Section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68 (2012 Rev Ed) on 20 December 2016 at about 10.48 am at Block D, 391 New Bridge Road, #03-11, Police Cantonment Complex, when required to sign the said statement by a public servant legally competent to require that you sign the statement, namely Assistant Superintendent of Police Lee Ting Wei, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 180 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev Ed).

8       Section 180 Penal Code provides:

Refusing to sign statement

180.  Whoever refuses to sign any statement made by him, when required to sign that statement by a public servant legally competent to require that he shall sign that statement, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $2,500, or with both.

#### Prosecution’s case

9       Much of the relevant facts were not in dispute, and were admitted by way of an “Agreed Statement of Facts” (Exh P1, “**ASOF**”). The prosecution’s case was based on the agreed facts, as well as certain additional evidence adduced from the prosecution witnesses.

#### (a)   Defendant organised the Event on 26 November 2016

10     It was undisputed that the defendant organised the Event entitled “Civil Disobedience and Social Movement”. He did so together with one Zeng Ruiqing. He organised the Event to discuss issues relating to civil disobedience and democracy in social change.[^1] The Event was scheduled on 26 November 2016 from about 4.00 - 6.00 pm. The venue was The AGORA, an indoor event venue located at 28 Sin Ming Lane, #03-142, Midview City, Singapore 573972.

11     The Event was open to the public. The defendant publicised the Event on Facebook by creating an Event Page and by posting the link to this page on his Facebook wall. (ASOF, Tabs A and B)

#### (b)   Defendant was advised that the Event required a permit

12     It was undisputed that three days before the Event, on 23 November 2016, Assistant Superintendent of Police Gideon Manaseh (PW2, “**ASP Gideon**”, as he then was) contacted the defendant. ASP Gideon advised the defendant to apply for a permit under the POA for the Event.

13     ASP Gideon testified that when he contacted the defendant, he advised the defendant to apply for a permit, stating he could do so online at his convenience. The defendant said that he would speak with the co-organiser before getting back to ASP Gideon. ASP Gideon then ended the conversation after telling the defendant he would call again in an hour. About an hour later, ASP Gideon tried calling the defendant again three times (at about 11.47 am, 11.55 am, and 12.30 pm), but the defendant did not pick up the call.[^2]

#### (c)   Event was held without a permit

14     It was undisputed that the defendant did not apply for a permit, and knew that no such permit was granted for the Event.

15     The Event was held on 26 November 2016 as scheduled. Members of the public attended the Event. Speeches were delivered by the following persons at the Event:

(a)     Han Yi Ling, Kirsten;

(b)     Seelan s/o Palay; and

(c)     Joshua Wong Chi-Fung (“**Joshua Wong**”). Joshua Wong was not a citizen of Singapore, which was a fact known to the defendant. Joshua Wong delivered his speech via video call, using the “Skype” application on a laptop. The video call lasted 119 minutes.

(A transcript of some parts of these speeches was tendered in evidence as Exh P11.)

#### (d)   Defendant refused to sign statement recorded during investigations

16     A police report was subsequently lodged in relation to the Event (ASOF, Tab C). The matter was investigated by an investigation officer, Assistant Superintendent of Police Lee Ting Wei (as he then was) (PW1, the “**IO**”).

17     On 20 December 2016 at 10.00 am, the IO recorded a statement from the defendant (Exh P5, the “**Statement**”) under the provisions of s 22 of the _Criminal Procedure Code_ (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“**CPC**”). The defendant chose to speak in English. No threat, inducement or promise was made before or during the recording of the Statement. The Statement was recorded accurately. After the Statement was recorded, it was read back to the defendant in English. He affirmed the Statement to be true and correct. He was asked to sign the Statement, but he refused. The recording of the Statement concluded at 10.48 am that day.[^3]

18     The IO testified that after recording the defendant’s answers, he informed the defendant that he was required to sign the Statement. The defendant asked if he would receive a copy of the Statement after signing it. The IO replied that he would not, as the Statement was a confidential document meant for police investigations. The defendant then refused to sign the Statement.[^4]

19     (It was not in dispute that subsequently, on 28 November 2017, the IO recorded two statements from the defendant under the provisions of s 23 of the CPC (Exhs P7 and P8, the “s 23 statements”). The defendant did sign both s 23 statements.[^5] The IO testified that the defendant did so after being told that he would be given a copy of these statements.[^6])

#### Defence

20     After the close of the prosecution’s case, the defendant was called upon to enter his defence. The defendant elected not to testify, and did not call any witnesses to testify in his defence.

21     Legal submissions were made by the defence as to why the defendant ought not to be found guilty.

22     In respect of the POA Charge, the defence submitted that:

(a)     The requirement for a permit under s 7 of the POA breached the defendant’s constitutional right of freedom of assembly under Art 14 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Rep) (the “**Constitution**”).

(b)     The Event did not constitute an “assembly” within the meaning of s 2 of the POA. For the Event to constitute an “assembly”, it must seek to publicise a specific cause; the Event was merely a discussion on multiple topics of general academic interest (and not to publicise a specific cause). Furthermore, the Event posed no threat to public order, safety or security.

23     In respect of the Penal Code Charge, the defence submitted that:

(a)     The Statement attracted the right against self-incrimination under s 22(2) CPC, and the IO was not legally competent to require the defendant to sign the Statement;

(b)     s 22(3) CPC merely provided a procedural guideline to ensure the voluntariness and accuracy of the statement and did not require the defendant to sign the statement.

#### Decision on POA Charge

#### (a)   Permit generally required for a public assembly

24     Section 5(1) POA provides that (generally) a permit is required before any “public assembly” takes place:

5.—(1)    Subject to the provisions of this Act, _a public assembly_ and a public procession _shall not take place unless_ —

(a)    the _Commissioner_ \[of Police\] _is notified_ under section 6 of the intention to hold the public assembly or public procession, and _a permit is granted under section 7_ in respect of that public assembly or public procession, as the case may be; and

(b)    the holding of that public assembly or public procession is not prohibited under section 12 or 13.

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

25     The words “assembly” and “public assembly” are defined in s 2 POA as follows:

“assembly” means _a gathering or meeting_ (whether or not comprising any lecture, _talk, address_, debate or _discussion_) of persons the purpose (_or one of the purposes_) of which is —

(a)    to demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or actions of any person, group of persons or any government;

(b)    to publicise a cause or campaign; or

(c)    to mark or commemorate any event,

and includes a demonstration by a person alone for any such purpose referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c);

\[...\]

“public assembly” means an assembly held or to be held _in a public place or_ to which _members of the public_ in general are _invited_, induced or permitted to attend\[.\]

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

26     Such permit is not required if the assembly is an exempt assembly. The _Public Order (Exempt Assemblies and Processions) Order 2009_ (the “**2009 Order**”) provides for “exempt assemblies”, as follows:

Exempt assemblies

4.–(1)    A public assembly \[...\] that is held wholly inside a building or other enclosed premises outside of the prohibited area, and –

(a)    every organiser of which is a citizen of Singapore or a Singapore entity;

(b)     _every individual giving a speech or lecture during the assembly_ (whether in person, through real-time transmission or a recording) _is a citizen of Singapore_;

(c)    the purpose of which is to demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or actions of any person, group of persons, to publicise a cause or campaign, or to mark or commemorate any event, without dealing with any matter which relates (directly or indirectly) to any religious belief or religion, or any matter which may cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore; and

(d)    during which an organiser thereof, or an authorised agent of such an organiser, is present at all times during the assembly.

\[...\]

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

#### (b)   Requirement for permit does not breach Art 14 of the Constitution

27     The defence submitted that the requirement for a permit under the POA to organise a public assembly was in breach of the defendant’s rights under Art 14 of the Constitution. I did not accept this submission.

28     Art 14(1)(b) of the Constitution gives all citizens of Singapore “the right to assemble peaceably and without arms”. Art 14(2) provides that Parliament may by law impose “such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof or public order”.

29     The right of assembly under Art 14 is not an absolute right. It may be circumscribed by Parliament, for example, in the interest of public order: _Chee Siok Chin & Ors v Minister for Home Affairs & Anor_ \[2006\] 1 SLR (R) 582 (“**_Chee Siok Chin_**”). In _Chee Siok Chin_, the High Court made it clear that there is a wide “legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach in the maintenance of public order”. The High Court stated (at \[50\]-\[54\]):

50    It is also crucial to note that the legislative power to circumscribe the rights conferred by Art 14 of the Constitution is, _inter alia_, delineated by what is “in the interest of public order” and not confined to “the maintenance of public order”. _This is a much wider legislative remit that allows Parliament to take a prophylactic approach in the maintenance of public order._ This necessarily will include laws that are not purely designed or crafted for the immediate or direct maintenance of public order \[...\]

51    There is nothing irregular, arbitrary, or unusual about Parliament’s right to limit the right of assembly or freedom of speech. The genealogy of Art 14 of the Constitution can be traced back to the _Report of the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission 1957_ (G A Smith, 1957) (at para 162) where it was recommended “that freedom of speech and expression should be guaranteed to all citizens _subject to restrictions in the interests of security, public order or morality or in relation to incitement, defamation or contempt of court_” \[emphasis added\].

\[...\]

53    The right of assembly can never be absolute and may be subordinated to public convenience and good order for the protection of the general welfare whenever it is “necessary or expedient”. From time to time, for the common welfare and good, individual interests have to be subordinated to the wider community’s interests. _There is also nothing inherently wrong or unreasonable in requiring permission from the relevant authorities to be sought prior to the holding of a public meeting or assembly. This can be viewed as a facilitative arrangement._

54    The nub of the matter is that Arts 14(1)(a) and 14(1)(b) of the Constitution do not confer absolute or immutable rights. \[...\].

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

30     The permit requirement under the POA can therefore be viewed as a “facilitative arrangement” which is neither inherently wrong or unreasonable. The defence did not provide cogent reasons, and it was unclear from their submissions how such requirement of a permit under the POA was in breach of the Constitution.

#### (c)   The Event was a public assembly

31     I now turn to the next argument made by the defence, that the Event was not an “assembly”. The defence characterised the Event as a _discussion_ on issues relating to civil disobedience and social movements. It was submitted that from both the format and the substance of the Event, it did not seek to publicise or promote or advocate any specific cause, but rather to facilitate a discussion on the topics relating to political involvement, activism and civil participation in general. It also had an educational and academic element as the presenters touched on various historical, social and political perspectives on social movements in general. It did not in any way seek to rally support for any particular social issue. The topics and issues raised in the Event were diverse, non-specific, and anecdotal. Each panellist shared his or her personal experiences and views from a first-person perspective, and never collectively advocated any specific cause.

32     I was not persuaded by this submission. The meaning of “assembly” under s 2 of the POA (reproduced at \[25\], above) includes any gathering or meeting for which the purpose, _or one of the purposes_, is to publicise a cause. The gathering or meeting may take various forms, and may comprise a “lecture, talk, address, debate or discussion”. It is not a requirement that the meeting or gathering seeks to promote or rally support for a particular cause; it is sufficient if the meeting or gathering _publicises_ the cause (in the sense of making it widely known).

33     The word “cause” is not defined in the POA. In the Oxford English Dictionary, a “cause” is defined to mean, among other things, “a principle, aim or movement to which one is committed and which one is prepared to defend or advocate”.[^7] In the present case, the “cause” was apparent from the title of the Event, “Civil Disobedience and Social Movements”. It was also evident from the content of the talks at the Event. For example, the defendant, when he spoke at the Event, did seek to publicise the cause of civil disobedience. The following is an extract of what he said:

So it seems like the Singapore approach is to have a picnic. Right, if you look at how successful Pink Dot is, right, everyone is happy to go to Pink Dot, wear pink, and party, and you know, eat pink muffins and pink cakes, you know, pink as a show of solidarity.

I mean I think it is a great movement, and I say this not to criticize Pink Dot, but _it seems like in Singapore there are certain ways in which we do our activism, and we don’t seem to like this very confrontational civil disobedience types of actions. So how do we how do we get there, I think this is the billion-dollar question_. Step by step, do we do we wait for many pink dots to happen and then slowly we transition there, or _do we need to have a bunch of individuals come together and really hammer on in the civil disobedience so that we open space_ in the same way that um, people like Seelan, Dr Chee Soon Juan and all that, did 10 years. This is something for us to think about. [^8]

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

34     On the facts, it was clear that the Event, which included talks and addresses by various speakers to publicise the cause of civil disobedience and social movements, was an “assembly”. And given that it was undisputed that the Event was held in a public place and members of the public were invited to attend the Event, it was a “_public_ assembly” within the meaning of s 2 of the POA.

#### (d)   No permit was obtained for the Event

35     Being a public assembly, the Event required a permit: s 5(1) POA (above, at \[24\]). The exemptions under the 2009 Order (above, at \[26\]) did not apply to the Event. One of the conditions in the 2009 Order for an assembly to be exempt from the requirement of a permit was that _every individual_ giving a speech or lecture during the assembly was a citizen of Singapore. The Event did not meet that criterion, as one of the speakers at the Event (Joshua Wong) was not a citizen of Singapore. Hence the exemption did not apply to the Event, and a permit was required for the Event to be held.

36     It was not in dispute that no permit was obtained. Hence the defendant, as an organiser of the Event for which a permit was required but not obtained, was guilty of an offence under s 16(1)(a) POA (above, at \[6\]).

37     The defence submitted that the Event was peaceful and posed absolutely no threat to public order, safety or security. This, however, was not a valid defence to the charge. The offence under s 16(1)(a) POA is a regulatory offence. The offence was not that a public assembly was held which caused public disturbance; but that it was held _without a permit_.

#### (e)   Verdict

38     The prosecution had therefore proven the POA Charge against the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, and he was found guilty and convicted on the charge.

#### Decision on Penal Code Charge

#### (a)   Power of police officers to record statements

39     The power of police officers to record statements from witnesses in the course of investigations is provided under s 22 of the _Criminal Procedure Code_ (“**CPC**”). The relevant parts of s 22 CPC provide as follows:

Power to examine witnesses

22.—(1) In conducting an investigation under this Part, a police officer \[...\] may examine orally any person who appears to be acquainted with any of the facts and circumstances of the case —

(a) whether before or after that person or anyone else is charged with an offence in connection with the case; and

(b) whether or not that person is to be called as a witness in any inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under this Code in connection with the case.

(2) The person examined shall be bound to state truly what he knows of the facts and circumstances of the case, except that he need not say anything that might expose him to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture.

(3) _A statement made by any person examined under this section must_ —

(a) be in writing;

(b) be read over to him;

(c) if he does not understand English, be interpreted for him in a language that he understands; and

(d) _be signed by him_.

\[ _Emphasis_ added\]

40     Under s 180 of the Penal Code, it is an offence for a person to refuse to sign a statement made by him or her when required to do so by a public servant legally competent to require the statement to be signed. Section 180 Penal Code provides:

Refusing to sign statement

180.  Whoever refuses to sign any statement made by him, when required to sign that statement by a public servant legally competent to require that he shall sign that statement, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $2,500, or with both.

41     On a plain reading of these provisions, a witness who provides a statement under s 22 CPC _must_ sign it, and the police officer recording such a statement is legally competent to require the witness to sign the statement: s 22(3)(d) CPC.

#### (b)   Defendant refused to sign statement recorded from him

42     It was not in dispute that the Statement (Exh P5) was recorded from the defendant on 20 December 2016, and that he refused to sign the Statement.

43     The defence to this charge was two-fold. First, there was a right against self-incrimination under s 22(2) of the CPC, and the IO was not legally competent to compel the defendant to sign the Statement. Second, s 22(3) of the CPC merely provided a procedural guideline to ensure the voluntariness and accuracy of the statement, and did not _require_ the defendant to sign the statement. I was not persuaded by these arguments.

44     Section 22(2) CPC provides that a person examined “shall be bound to state truly what he knows of the facts and circumstances of the case, except that he need not say anything that might expose him to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture”. A person examined has a right against self-incrimination in that the person is entitled not to state anything that may incriminate himself or herself. However, if a statement is _made_, it must be signed: s 22(3)(d) CPC. This would be the case even if the statement contained purportedly incriminating material. A person’s right against self-incrimination is distinct from and should not be conflated with the legal competence of a police officer to compel the maker of the statement to sign the statement after it has been made. A witness examined by a police officer _must_ sign a statement that he or she has made, and is not entitled to refuse to sign it.

45     I was likewise not persuaded by the defence’s second argument, that s 22(3) CPC merely provided a procedural guideline and did not require the statement to be signed. Such a construction of the provision did not accord with its plain meaning, which is mandatory rather than directory in nature.

#### (c)   Verdict

46     Accordingly, I found that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had refused to sign the Statement despite being required to do so by the IO, who was a public servant legally competent to require that the statement be signed. No valid legal defence had been raised to justify the defendant’s refusal to sign it. He was thus found guilty and convicted on the Penal Code Charge.

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

47     The prosecution submitted that the following sentences would be appropriate:

(a)     for the POA Charge, a fine of not less than $2,000 (in default, 14 days’ imprisonment); and

(b)     for the Penal Code Charge, a fine of not less than $1,200 (in default, 8 days’ imprisonment).

48     It was submitted by the prosecution that the defendant had behaved wilfully, which was an aggravating factor. A few days before the Event, he was advised by the police that a permit was required for the Event and that the permit could be applied for online. The defendant acknowledged this but proceeded with the Event without applying for a permit. When the police investigated the matter and took a statement from him under s 22 of the CPC, he refused to sign the statement. The defendant had displayed no remorse, and had claimed trial to the two charges despite the overwhelming evidence against him.

#### Defence’s submissions on sentence

49     In the defence’s submissions on the sentence, the defence urged that a sentence of “the minimum fine permissible by law” be imposed in respect of both offences. It was submitted that the defendant was a first time offender, and that he was “co-operative during the course of the investigations and at trial”.

50     For the POA Charge, it was submitted that the original mischief that the POA sought to address was the threat of violence and / or anti-social behaviour in society. The Event was intended primarily as a peaceful and civilised academic discussion on various topics of general public interest. It was held in an indoor space and no member of the public was inconvenienced, disturbed or put in any form of physical danger. There was no disturbance or nuisance or danger posed to public order or safety. The defendant had no mischievous or malicious intentions, and had organised the Event in good faith for the purposes of facilitating a peaceful discussion between individuals that shared common academic interests.

51     For the Penal Code Charge, it was submitted that the defendant’s refusal to sign the statement was made on a principled basis, and that no serious consequences flowed from his refusal to sign the statement.

#### Sentencing considerations for POA Charge

52     In respect of the POA Charge, I accepted the prosecution’s submission that the defendant’s wilful breach of the requirement to obtain a permit was an aggravating factor in sentencing. A breach committed wilfully rather than inadvertently is indicative of a higher degree of culpability.

53     In submitting on the appropriate sentence, the prosecution made reference to the (unreported) case of _PP v Jacob Lau Jian Rong_ (MAC-901898-2014) (“**_Jacob Lau_**”). The offender pleaded guilty to one charge of organising a public procession at Raffles City Shopping Centre. This was in support of the “Million Mask March”, an online movement which called for 24-hour protests globally on “Guy Fawkes” day. The offender was arrested before he could start moving off from the shopping centre. A fine of $1,000 (in default, one week’s imprisonment) was imposed.

54     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that the facts of the present case were more aggravated than in _Jacob Lau_. The present defendant was advised by the police to apply for a permit before the Event, yet he failed to do so. The defendant had also shown no remorse in claiming trial to the charges despite the clear evidence against him, unlike in _Jacob Lau_ where the offender pleaded guilty. Hence the defendant ought to receive a sentence higher than in _Jacob Lau._ In my judgment, a fine of $2,000 as submitted by the prosecution would be commensurate with the defendant’s culpability.

55     The defence cited a number of past cases involving “elements of public disturbance and/or nuisance”: _PP v Yan Jun_ \[2017\] SGMC 76; _Ng Chye Huay v PP_ \[2006\] 1 SLR(R) 157; _Chee Soon Juan v PP_ \[2011\] SGHC 40.[^9] However, I did not find any of these cases relevant or helpful given their very dissimilar and more aggravating facts.

#### Sentencing considerations for Penal Code Charge

56     In submitting on the appropriate sentence for the Penal Code Charge, the prosecution made reference to the case of _PP v Ng Chye Huay_ \[2017\] SGMC 42. There the offender claimed trial to four counts of the offence of refusing to sign her statements. She refused to sign her statements because she did not trust the statement recorders, and felt that they were “twisting her words”. A fine of $1,200 (in default, 8 days’ imprisonment) was imposed for each charge, resulting in a total fine of $4,800 (in default, 32 days’ imprisonment). In deciding on the appropriate sentence the court observed that the offender showed no remorse. The offender’s appeals against her conviction and sentence were dismissed: _Ng Chye Huay v PP_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 9222 of 2017) (“**_Ng Chye Huay_**”).

57     In the present case, the defendant’s culpability was, in my judgment, somewhat similar to that in _Ng Chye Huay_, and a similar fine of $1,200 would be appropriate for the Penal Code Charge.
