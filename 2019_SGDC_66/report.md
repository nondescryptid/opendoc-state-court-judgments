### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Background

1       The accused, aged 20 years old, pleaded guilty to the following three drug-related charges:

a)     One charge of possessing not less than 499.99 grams of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (“trafficking of cannabis charge”);

b)     One charge of possessing 1999 tablets found to contain nimetazepam, a Class “C” controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (“trafficking of nimetazepam charge”);

c)     One charge of possessing not less than 235.64 grams of methamphetamine, a controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (“trafficking of methamphetamine charge”).

2       Four other drug-related charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“the TIC charges”), namely, for offences of trafficking of four different types of drugs.

3       On 25 March 2019, the accused was sentenced as follows:

a)     Trafficking of cannabis (DAC 938341/2018) – 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane;

b)     Trafficking of nimetazepam (DAC 942192/2017) – 2 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane;

c)     Trafficking of methamphetamine (DAC 942193/2017) – 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

Two of the sentences in DAC 938341/2018 and DAC 942192/2017 were ordered to run consecutively, making it a total sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane[^1]. The sentence was ordered to be backdated to the accused’s first date of remand, which was on 4 November 2016.

4       Upon the application of the prosecution, the accused was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal for the charge of possessing not less than 999.99 grams of cannabis mixture for the purpose of trafficking (DAC 938342/2018).

5       On the same day, the defence filed a notice of appeal against the sentence. The accused is currently serving his sentence.

## Charges

6       The three proceeded charges reproduced below state as follows:

DAC 938341/2018

7       The following four TIC charges are as follows:

d)     Possession of 350 tablets found to contain 5-Methoxy-MiPT, a Controlled drug, for the purpose of trafficking (DAC 942196/2017).

## Summary of Facts

8       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) pertaining to the above charges, without qualification. The salient points are as follows:

a)     At the material time, the accused was 18 years old.

b)     On 2 November 2016, acting on information, a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), staged an operation to arrest the accused. At about 5.30pm on the same day, the CNB officers were outside the accused’s residence. When the accused realised that the CNB officers were outside his unit, he threw a number of items out of the window in an attempt to dispose of the evidence. These were later established to be the subject matter of the present charges. The CNB officers raided the unit and arrested the accused. The accused and his unit were searched as well as the vicinity of the block where the accused resided. Items were recovered and seized as per the paragraphs below.

c)     Sometime in late 2016, the accused became indebted to one “Ah Long” as a result of his involvement in illegal gambling. By October 2016, the accused owed one “Ah Long” $2,400. The accused began to repay the debt by working for “Ah Long” as a lookout of illegal gambling operations.

d)     In early October 2016, “Ah Long’s friend” offered the accused a way to clear his debt at a faster rate. In mid-October 2016, the accused received a call on his phone from one “Melvin” who instructed the accused to collect a bag containing four black tape bundles from the ‘dry riser’ on the 15th storey of the Housing and Development Board block where the accused resided (“the block”). The accused did so accordingly. Acting on “Melvin’s” instructions, he then re-packed the items found inside the bag and the bundles into six plastic bags. In this manner, the accused first worked for “Melvin” and “Ah Long” re-packing drugs. In so doing, the accused cleared $1,200 of his debt to “Ah Long”.

e)     The seized exhibits found at the grass patch at the foot of the block where the accused attempted to dispose of the evidence, were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. They were collectively three blocks of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain not less than 499.99 grams of Cannabis[^2], a Class A controlled drug.

f)     The seized exhibits found at the pavement at the foot of the same block were sent to HSA for analysis. They were found to contain nimetazepam and methamphetamine respectively. In particular, some of the seized exhibits pertain to 1999 tablets, where they were analysed and at least 90% of which were found to contain nimetazepam, a Class C controlled drug[^3].

g)     As for the remaining seized exhibits, they were found to contain not less than 461.09 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 235.64 grams of Methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug[^4].

h)     Investigations revealed that on 2 November 2016, at about 3.00pm, the accused received a call from “Melvin” on his phone and was told that “the ship is arriving”, which he understood to mean that the second repacking assignment was going to start soon. He then waited for “Melvin’s” further instructions.

i)     On the same day, at about 3.20pm, the co-accused, one Goh Ban Yong (“Goh”), was spotted by the CNB officers, driving the car bearing registration number JHW3555 and entering the carpark of the said block. At about 4.15pm, Goh placed a black haversack at the “dry riser” on the 15th storey of the same block. At around 4.30pm, the accused received a call from “Melvin” who informed the accused to retrieve the “things” from the “dry riser” on the 15th storey. Subsequently, the accused went to the said “dry riser” and retrieved the black haversack which he then brought back into his unit.

j)     The accused admitted that the exhibits seized were in fact inside the black haversack which he had retrieved from the “dry riser” prior to his arrest. The accused knew that the said exhibits contained cannabis, nimetazepam and methamphetamine, respectively.

k)     The accused was in possession of the said exhibits for the purpose of trafficking. He intended to follow “Melvin’s” instructions to re-pack the drugs into plastic bags and return the drugs to the “dry riser” where it would then be picked up by someone else.

l)     At the material time, the accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, to have in his possession any controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking.

## Antecedents

9       The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

10     Notwithstanding the accused’s young age at the material time, the prosecution submitted that general deterrence would be the dominant sentencing consideration given the seriousness of the offences committed by the accused, where the drugs involved were substantial. Further, the offences carry minimum mandatory imprisonment terms of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for each of the trafficking of Class A drugs and minimum mandatory imprisonment term of two years’ imprisonment and minimum mandatory caning of two strokes of the cane for the trafficking of nimetazepam charge. In that regard, it was submitted that deterrence clearly outweighed the need for rehabilitation. Further, with the recent amendments to the reformative training (“RT”) regime, only minimum detention periods of between six and twelve months can be ordered for youthful offenders sentenced to RT[^5]. It was thus clearly inappropriate in light of the seriousness of the offences committed by the accused as well as the aggravating factors highlighted below.

11     In particular, the prosecution highlighted the following:

a)     The accused was not a mere courier but his role was to re-pack the drugs to facilitate the drug trafficking activities;

b)     The scale of the operation was not small as it involved the accused’s actions being co-ordinated where he had received multiple phone calls from “Melvin” giving him instructions; and

c)     The accused attempted to dispose of the evidence when he threw the seized exhibits out of his window unit when he realised that the CNB officers were outside his unit.

12     Additionally, the prosecution further submitted that the current case can be distinguished from the case of _PP v Praveen s/o Prasath_ (“_Praveen_”), where the offender, aged 19 years old at the material time, pleaded guilty to one single charge of trafficking of not less than 499.99 grams of cannabis, where the minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane was imposed. The extenuating circumstances present in _Praveen_’s case were clearly lacking in the current case.

13     Specifically, it was undisputed that the current accused had committed the offences of picking up the drugs to be re-packed to facilitate the drug trafficking to clear his debt of $1,200 whereas the offender in _Praveen_ was paid $250 to pick up the drugs to be delivered to the recipient. In imposing the minimum mandatory imprisonment term and the minimum mandatory caning, the court took into account the offender’s personal circumstances where he had a prior clean record, but was ‘dealt a bad hand in life where at a tender age of 13, he had to fend for himself and a bedridden mother.’ He was the sole breadwinner and took on several jobs to make ends meet until the latest setback where his hand was injured. The court was of the view that the circumstances he was facing were considered to be exceptionally harsh and ‘would be crushing for many’. In that regard, the court determined that the minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment would be ‘sufficient punishment for the accused in terms of achieving both specific and general deterrence’ (see \[27\]).

14     It was further submitted that the current accused was given an option to clear his debt by acting as a look-out for illegal gambling operations, but he chose instead to re-pack the drugs when it was suggested to the accused that he could do such ‘work’ to repay his loan at ‘a faster rate’ (see \[6\] and \[7\] of the SOF). In light of the foregoing as well as the fact that the circumstances under which the current accused had committed these offences could be distinguished from _Praveen_’s case, it was submitted that the accused should not be sentenced to the minimum mandatory imprisonment term for the trafficking charges.

15     In the latest case of S_oh Qiu Xia Katty v PP_ (“_Katty Soh_”), which dealt with repeat offenders for drug trafficking offences, Chan Seng Onn J 9 (“Chan J”) modified the sentencing framework in _PP v Lai Teck Guan_ (“_Lai Teck Guan_”) which sets out the approach to be taken when sentencing repeat offenders who traffic in less than 15 grams of diamorphine. In \[44\] of _Katty Soh’s_ case, Chan J sets out the revised sentences for a notional first-time offender, a repeat offender with minimum indicative uplift, and a repeat offender with maximum indicative uplift at various weight points. As the current case involves a first offender, the prosecution submitted that the starting sentence for the accused facing a trafficking charge of not less than 499.99 grams of cannabis should be similar to one facing a trafficking charge of not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine as these respective weight points would attract a sentence which would almost be the maximum term of 30 years’ imprisonment before the capital punishment threshold would have been crossed.

16     With reference to the table in _Katty Soh’s_ case, setting out the various weight points for diamorphine, the prosecution submitted that the starting sentence of a first-time offender who traffics in not less than 499.99 grams of cannabis would be 28 years’ imprisonment (similar to one who traffics in 14.99 grams of diamorphine). This was also not inconsistent with the case of _Suventher Shanmugam v PP_ (“_Suventher_”) which was decided before _Katty Soh’s_ case, where the Court of Appeal laid down sentencing guidelines setting out indicative starting points for the unauthorised import or trafficking of cannabis. In particular, trafficking of cannabis weighing between 431grams to 500 grams, would have attracted sentences between 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment as a starting point.

17     Following the same sentencing framework in _Katty Soh_, it was further submitted that the starting sentence for a first time offender facing a charge of trafficking 235.64 grams of methamphetamine is 26 years’ imprisonment. This was on the basis that a charge of trafficking 249.99 grams of methamphetamine would attract a similar starting sentence for trafficking 14.99 grams of diamorphine, which was 28 years’ imprisonment. Thus, trafficking in a lower amount of methamphetamine (i.e. 235.64 grams) would have proportionately attracted a reduced starting sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment. In that regard, the prosecution submitted that in view of the accused’s young age, his plea of guilt as well as his role, a sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for each of the trafficking charges (ie that of cannabis and methamphetamine respectively) would be appropriate.

18     Turning to the table of sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution in relation to offenders who had pleaded guilty to charges of trafficking in nimetazepam, the prosecution highlighted two cases, namely _PP v Chow Mun_ (“_Chow Mun_”), a first offender who was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane, for trafficking in 5000 tablets of Nimetazepam as well as the case of _PP v Norhisham Bin Mohamad Dahlan_ (“_Norhisham_”), who was sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane for the charge of trafficking in 220 tablets of nimetazepam. In view of the substantial amount of methamphetamine tablets found in the accused’s possession (i.e. 1999 tablets), it was submitted that the appropriate sentence would lie somewhere between these two ranges of 3 years’ and 8 years’ imprisonment. However, given the accused’s young age and his plea of guilt, the prosecution submitted that a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment and the minimum mandatory caning of 2 strokes would be appropriate.

19     Notwithstanding the fact that the co-accused, Goh, had been sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane, for a similar charge of trafficking in 1999 tablets of nimetazepam, the prosecution submitted that the global sentences for Goh and the current accused would be the basis of distinguishing them, in terms of their respective roles (with Goh, being the courier, on one hand, and the current accused, the re-packer of the drugs on the other) and their differing ages, with the current accused being a youthful offender at the material time. Goh was 40 years old, a first offender and had previously pleaded guilty to similar charges as the accused, save for the trafficking of cannabis charge where the quantity of cannabis involved was different. Goh faced one count of trafficking in not less than 330 grams of cannabis whereas the current accused pleaded guilty to trafficking in not less than 499.99 grams of cannabis. For ease of reference, Goh had pleaded guilty to the following charges with the respective sentences imposed, and received a global sentence of 28 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane:

20     For completeness, the following five TIC charges are below:

a)     Possession of not less than 999.9 grams of cannabis mixture, a Controlled drug, for the purpose of trafficking (DAC 938344/2018);

b)     Possession of not less than 15.52 grams of fragmented vegetable matter containing 5-Fluoro-UR-144, a controlled drug, for the purpose of trafficking (DAC 942197/2017);

c)     Possession of not less than 6.62 grams of MDMA, a controlled drug, for the purpose of trafficking (DAC 942200/2017);

d)     Possession of 350 tablets found to contain Ethylone, a controlled drug, for the purpose of trafficking (DAC 942201/2017); and

e)     Possession of 350 tablets found to contain 5-Methoxy-MiPT, a controlled drug, for the purpose of trafficking (DAC 942202/2017).

21     The prosecution sought a global sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane with the sentences for the trafficking of cannabis charge and that of trafficking of nimetazepam to run consecutively, making a distinction from Goh’s total sentence received on the basis that the current accused is a young offender and had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.

## Mitigation

22     The defence counsel in her written mitigation plea, highlighted that the applicable sentencing framework in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on a young offender involves a two-stage process which requires the court to:

(i)     Identify and prioritise the primary sentencing consideration appropriate to the young offender (“stage one”); and

(ii)     Select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations (“stage two”) (see _Muhammad Zuhairie Adely Bin Zulkifli v PP_ at \[21\] (“_Muhammad Zuhairie_”) and _PP v ASR_ at \[50\] (“_ASR_”)).

23     It was submitted that rehabilitation would be the dominant sentencing consideration in view of the following:

a)     The accused’s young age of 18 years and 7 months old at the material time;

b)     The accused is a first offender;

c)     The accused has strong familial support;

d)     The accused’s high propensity to reform; and

e)     His genuine remorse.

24     In particular, the accused’s strong familial support is evident from the regular visits made to prisons while the accused has been in remand for the last two years despite their ‘working odd jobs with irregular working schedules’. They have also voluntarily undergone ‘informal counselling’ with Ms Vivien Khoo (“Ms Khoo”), a ‘family mentor’ from the “The Society of the Father and the Son” (“SFS”) as well as Ms Agnes Wong (“Ms Wong”), a certified counsellor from SFS, since December 2018, to put themselves in a better position to support the accused’s rehabilitative efforts.

25     In that regard, the defence sought for a sentence of reformative training (“RT”) in view of the efforts made by the accused’s parents as well as his extended family (who have since rallied round him to ensure their full support for the accused). It was further submitted that should the accused be sentenced to RT, the accused and his parents have consented for the accused to reside at the SFS Outreach Centre which provides a residential programme under the SFS during the first year of the accused’s release from the reformative training centre (“RTC”), with possible extension of his stay. The accused would also undergo rehabilitative programmes[^6] within a disciplined environment to enable him to ‘grow spiritually, morally, socially and emotionally so as to reintegrate him into society in a more meaningful and purposeful way’[^7].

26     In his own letter, the accused expressed regret in committing such a ‘huge mistake’ and promised to complete his education in the Institute of Education (“ITE”) or polytechnic in Sports and Wellness (should he be sentenced to RT), with a view of working with children and youths through Sports and Wellness programmes and helping them to stay away from unhealthy habits which would put them at risk[^8].

27     In a letter written by one of the ex-staff, Mr Muhammad Hafidz (“Mr Hafidz”), of Boys’ Town (“BT”), where the accused resided for two years pursuant to a Beyond Parental Control (“BPC”) complaint made by his parents in 2013, he opined that the accused displayed ‘servant leadership’ qualities and during his time there, the structured and guided environment in BT helped his development which earned the accused ‘personal awards’[^9].

28     It was further submitted that as a first offender, the accused is not a hardened criminal and neither has he consumed drugs in the past.

29     The defence submitted that the court should not be precluded from imposing a sentence of RT notwithstanding that the offences committed by the accused are serious (see _Muhammad Zuhairie_ at \[29\]) and especially if the youthful offender’s reformative prospects are demonstrably good (see _Muhammad Zuhairie_ at \[27\]). Thus, it was additionally submitted that given the accused’s high propensity to reform, a sentence of RT would be the appropriate sentence as ‘it strikes the appropriate balance between giving effect to the need for rehabilitation and deterrence’[^10].

30     By way of illustration, the defence further cited the following cases where ‘heinous offences’ were committed by the youthful offenders but the courts have nonetheless imposed alternative sentences (namely, detention in the Singapore Boys’ Home, probation or RT) other than imprisonment terms (see _PP v Foo Shik Jin & Ors_ (“_Foo Shik Jin & Ors_”); _Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP_ (“_Praveen Krishnan_”); _PP v Adith s/o Sarvotham_ (“_Adith_”).

31     For ease of reference, below is the table of cases cited by defence counsel which includes the offences committed by the youthful offenders, their respective ages and sentences imposed:

32     It was also submitted that should the accused not be sentenced to RT, he would potentially be facing a ‘significantly lengthy imprisonment’ term, such that ‘he will spend a crucial part of his youth in prison’. This will inevitably have an adverse impact such as being displaced from the mainstream education system, which in turn, may impede his ability to re-integrate into society upon his release[^12].

33     In the alternative, should this court not be minded to sentence the accused to a period of RT, the defence submitted for mandatory minimum sentences to be imposed for each of the proceeded charges, with the sentences for the charge of trafficking of cannabis and that of trafficking of methamphetamine to run consecutively, making it a total of 22 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. In particular, the defence relied on the mitigating factors as highlighted previously in \[23\] above, the accused’s plea of guilt, his co-operation with the authorities[^13] as well as his limited role. In particular, it was submitted that the accused’s culpability is low as he ‘merely performed a limited role in the transaction’ where he was acting on the instructions of “Melvin” to collect as well as repack the drugs which he is currently charged with. There is no evidence either that the accused was ‘intricately involved in the drug trade or was the mastermind of any such drug transactions’[^14].

34     In support of the minimum mandatory imprisonment terms, the defence relied on sentencing precedents and distinguished the facts of those cases from the current facts. In relation to the trafficking of cannabis charge, the defence also cited the case of _Suventher_ (see \[16\] above) and suggested the indicative starting point of 26 years’ imprisonment[^15], to be adjusted downwards to the minimum mandatory imprisonment term of 20 years and 15 strokes of the cane for the reasons highlighted above. Further, the case of _Praveen_ (see \[12\] and \[13\] above) was cited in support of the mandatory minimum imprisonment term to be imposed for a similar charge which the current accused also faces. Additionally, it was submitted that the TIC charges should not warrant an upward lift of the sentence above the mandatory minimum sentence following the High Court decision in _PP v Ravan s/o Samubil and Ors_ (“_Ravan_”) at \[69\] where Hoo Sheau Peng J observed that the ‘charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing should carry little weight, because they related to the same drug transaction’.

35     As for the trafficking of methamphetamine charge, the case of _Adri Anton Kalangie v PP_ (“_Adri Anton Kalangie_”) was cited where the Court of Appeal laid down a table of indicative starting sentences for the offence of trafficking or importation of 167 to 250g of methamphetamine, adapted from the _Suventher_ framework. As the current accused faced a charge of trafficking of 235.64 g of methamphetamine, the indicative starting sentence would be between 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for amounts of methamphetamine ranging between 217 to 250 g.

36     The defence cited two cases, namely, _Adri Anton Kalangie_ and that of _PP v Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai_ (“_Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai_”), where the accused persons had each pleaded guilty to one count of importation of not less than 249.99g of methamphetamine and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and 22 years’ imprisonment (in addition to 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning), respectively. It was submitted that the current case can be distinguished from the facts of these two cases, in view of the accused’s age at the material time. The accused persons in _Adri Anton Kalangie_ and _Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai_ were 41 years old and 47 years old respectively. Further, there were aggravating factors present in the above cases which were absent in the current accused’s case. In particular, the accused in _Adri Anton Kalangie_ had taken active and sophisticated steps to avoid detection of the offence by ingesting the drug pellets and inserting them into his body. Additionally, the accused in _Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai_ was found to have imported more than the 249.99 g of methamphetamine than she was charged for (i.e. 2,041g which would have ordinarily attracted the death penalty). Furthermore, the amount of methamphetamine (235.64g) involved for the current accused was less than these two cases (249.99g).

37     In relation to the trafficking of nimetazepam charge, the defence cited two reported cases, namely, _PP v Djarkasih Atiah_ (“_Djarkasih Atiah_”) and _Zhou Caisheng v PP_ (“_Zhou Caisheng_”), where the accused persons had similarly pleaded guilty to trafficking of tablets found to contain nimetazepam. The defence sought to distinguish the facts of these cases from the current facts, in that the former case involved trafficking of 30,000 tablets which was substantially more than the current accused’s charge involving 1999 tablets. In sentencing the accused to 8.5 years’ imprisonment, the court took into account the substantial amount of tablets involved, the fact that the commission of the offence ‘smacked of being well organised and syndicated’ and one other charge of being in possession of two tablets of nimetazepam was also taken into consideration.

38     In the latter case, the accused in _Zhou Caisheng_, who was 18-years old at the material time, had made arrangements with a buyer to sell drugs and was on his way to meet his buyer to deliver the drugs when he was arrested, whereas there was no evidence that the current accused was involved in the sale and trade of nimetazepam. Further, the accused in _Zhou Caisheng_ had an extra supply of 10 extra tablets of nimetazepam should the buyer wanted more supply (subject matter of the second trafficking charge). The current accused is a first offender whereas _Zhou Caisheng_ had a previous unrelated antecedent where he was sentenced to a fine of $1,000. The district court sentenced the accused to 4 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane for trafficking in 100 tablets and 2 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane for the second trafficking charge, with both sentences ordered to run concurrently.

39     Further, the defence sought to distinguish _Norhisham’s_ case cited by the prosecution from the current case in that whilst the quantity of tablets involved for the current accused is substantially more (i.e.1999) as compared to _Norhisham’s_ case involving trafficking of 220 tablets, _Norhisham_ was 29 years old, whereas the current accused was a youthful offender at the material time. Further, the accused in _Norhisham_ had been in the business of selling drugs at least three months prior to his arrest and making profits unlike the current accused. Thus, the defence submitted that a similar sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment which was imposed for _Norhisham_ should not be applicable to the present case.

40     In addition, it was submitted that the unreported cases cited by the prosecution in the table of sentencing precedents in relation to drug trafficking of cannabis carry little, if any precedential value because they are unreasoned (see _PP v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ at \[13\].

## Decision of the Court

#### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

41     I am mindful of the competing sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation when deciding on the appropriate sentence for the accused, a young offender, who has committed serious offences. That said, it is trite that rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ at \[21\] (“_Maurice Mok”_) and followed in _Leon Russel Francis v PP_ at \[13\] (“_Leon Russel Francis”_)).

42     However, rehabilitation can be diminished or eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution in appropriate situations as Menon CJ pointed in _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ at \[30\] (“_Boaz_”) and referred to by Chan J in _Muhammad Zuhairie’s_ case at \[23\] as the “_Boaz factors_”:

a)     the offence is serious;

b)     the harm caused is severe;

c)     the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; or

d)     the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable.

43     Thus, at this first stage of the sentencing inquiry for youthful offenders such as the accused is the ‘threshold question’ which is whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix (see _Boaz_ at \[34\]) or whether it has been ‘displaced’ as the primary sentencing consideration. Chan J’s observations in _Muhammad Zuhairie’s_ case at \[26\] and \[27\] are instructive:

26    I should add that it is not necessary for _all_ the _Boaz_ factors to be present for a court to hold that rehabilitation has been displaced as the primary sentencing consideration. However, if the offence is so serious and the young offender has no or very low rehabilitative prospects, then deterrence and/or punishment (in the form of punishment) would likely displace rehabilitation as the dominant consideration (see _Al-Ansari_ \[21\] (supra) at \[61\]).

27    Hence, the Prosecution submitted and I agreed, it was not necessary that a youthful offender was incapable of reform before the sentencing considerations such as deterrence and/or retribution could come to the fore and eclipse rehabilitation. The converse should then also hold true: that the absence of any or more of the Boaz factors would not always lead to the conclusion that the rehabilitation should retain its primacy in the sentencing matrix. Hence, just merely because a rehabilitation sentencing option such as reformative training is viable would not mean that the court would inexorably grant a sentence of reformative training. However, if a youthful offender’s reformative prospects are demonstrably good, the court should bear this in mind and lean in favour of rehabilitation when balancing the relevant sentencing considerations in the sentencing process.

44     I am also mindful that in situations where a youthful offender’s rehabilitative prospects are good, rehabilitation may not be outweighed by the need for deterrence despite the gravity of the offence committed by the youthful offender (see _Muhamad Zuhairie_ at \[29\]). The courts have also held that rehabilitation still remained a dominant sentencing consideration and imposed either probation or reformative training, even when serious offences such as drug-related offences were committed (see _Adith_ and _Leon Russel Francis_).

45     That said, I note that the drug trafficking offences committed by the current accused must be distinguished from the drug trafficking charge faced by the youthful offender in the case of _Adith_ in so far as the _quantity_ of drugs are concerned. For both the trafficking of cannabis and methamphetamine charges which the current accused pleaded guilty to, the quantities involved are nearly reaching the maximum weightage before the threshold for the death penalty is crossed, whereas in _Adith’s_ case, the amount of diamophine in the drug trafficking charge was 0.06g. In _Leon Russel Francis_’ case, the drug trafficking charge was taken into consideration (and the quantity involved may not have been significant as the grounds of decision released by the District Court and High Court made no mention of the same). As noted by Menon CJ in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ at \[19\] (“_Vasentha_”):

It is obvious that the quantity of drugs (measured in terms of net weight) that has been trafficked would have a direct correlation with the degree of harm to the society: see _Ong Ah Chuan v PP_ \[1979- 1980\] SLR(R) 710 (“_Ong Ah Chuan_”) at \[38\]; _Yong Vui Kong v PP_ at \[112\]; quantity therefore serves as a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the offence.

46     It cannot be over emphasised that the drug problem is a ‘scourge’ which must be stamped out through stiffer penalties and rigorous law enforcement. To that end, Singapore has consistently adopted a strong deterrent stance in relation to drug trafficking (see _Vasentha_ at \[12\]). As observed by Menon CJ in _Vasentha_ at \[14\]:

The legal framework under the MDA undoubtedly reflects the strong stance taken by Singapore against drugs in the severe punishments provided for drug trafficking. The MDA sentencing framework with regard to trafficking rests primarily on the _type_ and the _quantity_ of the drugs. … both factors reflect the extent of harm that may be caused by the distribution of drugs in question and this goes towards the seriousness of the offence.

47     Notwithstanding this, I had nonetheless called for the RTC suitability report (“RT report”) before determining what would be the appropriate sentence. A perusal of the RT report revealed that the accused shared a distant relationship with his parents since 2011, such that they were not aware of his gambling problem in 2016. He would in fact lie about his whereabouts when he went gambling. Even after he fell into debt, he did not seek their help as he had a strained relationship with them, pursuant to his parents making a BPC complaint in 2013 against him due to his excessive computer gaming. Despite having stayed in BT for two years, a large part of his youth was spent being unengaged as he had conduct problems such as truancy in secondary school and subsequently dropped out of ITE in 2016, due to his excessive computer gaming or illegal gambling. Neither was he gainfully employed as he was mostly associating with negative peers who were also similarly engaged in unconstructive and illegal activities. In view of the foregoing, I had serious concerns if his rehabilitative prospects were demonstrably good given his conduct and lifestyle that he led in the years prior to his remand.

48     After considering the _Boaz_ factors in \[43\] above, with regard to the accused’s offences and circumstances, in particular, the seriousness of the offences committed for which minimum mandatory imprisonment terms and caning are the prescribed punishments as stated in \[10\] above, I am of the view that rehabilitation had to ‘yield to other sentencing considerations’, which is that of deterrence.

49     In the present case, whilst the defence had argued that RT offers the court a “middle ground” that incorporates both elements of rehabilitation and deterrence (see _Boaz_ at \[36\] – \[38\]); as well as _Al-Ansari_ at \[57\] -58\]), I did not think that the deterrent effect of RT with the minimum detention of 12 months would be sufficient in view of the serious offences faced by the accused. This was the similar approach taken by the district judge in the case of _Praveen_ (_supra_) at \[24\] who opined that the RT with its minimum 18 months’ detention (then) ‘would not be sufficient’ for the offence of drug trafficking with its minimum punishment of 20 years’ imprisonment. As such, I was of the view that RT would not be an appropriate sentence. Thus, the only sentencing option would be imprisonment terms to be imposed.

50     I also note Chan J’s observations in _Muhammad Zuhairie_ at \[31\], in that there is public interest in both ensuring that young offenders are rehabilitated and in giving effect to both general and specific deterrence, ‘the fulcrum between them would have to be placed such that the sentencing considerations are balanced appropriately’. As there is still a “measure of rehabilitation” even if imprisonment is imposed on youthful offenders (see _Muhammad Zuhairie_ at \[33\]), I was thus mindful of these principles in determining the overall imprisonment term for the accused.

## The appropriate sentence

51     The defence had argued in the alternative for minimum mandatory imprisonment terms and the minimum mandatory caning for each of the proceeded charges. As the minimum mandatory caning for each of the proceeded charges are not in contest, I will focus my reasons on the length of imprisonment terms imposed.

### Trafficking of Cannabis and Methamphetamine Charges (“Class A” Drugs)

52     I shall deal with these offences first as they attract a minimum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment with 30 years’ imprisonment as the maximum punishment prescribed.

53     Where the offence concerns trafficking or importation of drugs, the gravity of the offence is measured by the quantity of drugs involved. The sentence imposed should thus be proportional to the quantity of drugs in the offender’s possession (see _Suventher_ in \[21\]).

54     In view of the substantial quantities for the trafficking charges concerning cannabis and methamphetamine respectively, it was largely not disputed by parties that the starting indicative sentences would be 28 years’ and 26 years’ imprisonment respectively. It was further undisputed that the following mitigating factors as highlighted above by the defence would go some way in calibrating the starting indicative sentences downwards in favour of the accused:

a)     The accused’s young age at the material time;

b)     His lack of antecedents;

c)     His co-operation with the authorities; and

d)     His early plea of guilt.

55     The issue then is how far should the starting sentences be adjusted downwards, namely, to the minimum mandatory imprisonment term (which is 20 years’ imprisonment for each of the charges) as contended by the defence or to 23 years’ imprisonment as submitted by the prosecution. The indicative starting sentence could be adjusted upwards or downwards to take into account the accused’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors (see _Suventher_ at \[29\] and \[30\]). With this in mind, I now turn to the facts of the current case.

#### Accused’s Culpability

56     In assessing the accused’s culpability, the sentencing judge would have to consider his motive as well as the nature and extent of his role and involvement in the drug trade (see _Vasentha_ at \[49\]). It cannot be gainsaid either that one who engages in drug trafficking activities for personal gain would bear a higher degree of culpability than one who becomes involved only because he was coerced or threatened into doing it, or was exploited by virtue of his low intellectual ability or naivety (see _Vasentha_ at \[40\]).

57     I note the accused’s motive in committing the offences, which was essentially to clear his loans at a faster rate from the unlicensed moneylenders when he fell into debt due to his illegal gambling activities. As pointed out by the prosecution, the accused had the option to continue to work as a ‘look-out’ for the illegal gambling operations as a means to repay his debt to “Ah Long” (which was not ideal but the legal consequences would have been less serious than the accused’s present situation). Instead, he chose the riskier option of repacking drugs of substantial amounts. This can be distinguished from _Praveen’s_ case where the district judge took into account the clearly extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence (as highlighted in \[13\] above), which warranted a downward adjustment to the minimum mandatory imprisonment term of 20 years. I agree with the prosecution that such extenuating circumstances, however, were clearly absent in the present case.

58     The accused had informed the Correctional Rehabilitation Specialist who prepared the RT report that he committed the current offences out of his desperation to pay off his loans as he felt ‘threatened by the unlicensed money lender’ (see page 4 of RT report). Whilst the defence had not raised this as a mitigating factor, I thought that I should deal with this point in any event. I note that the accused had admitted in the SOF that he had agreed to re-pack the drugs as he wanted to clear his debt quickly which was also consistent with what was stated in the RT report that he wanted to ‘get it over and done with’, rather than a real threat occasioned by the illegal moneylenders. There was no suggestion either of any actual threats made against him or his family other than the fact that he was told to follow the instructions of the unlicensed moneylender or “he would know”[^16]. I therefore placed no weight that there was any threat or perceived threat made by the unlicensed money lender which resulted in the accused committing the current offences.

59     Even if the folly of youth may have gone some way in explaining the accused’s conduct in making bad decisions culminating in the commission of the present offences, I was of the view that the accused had clearly failed to learn from his past mistakes for his unruly behaviour or internalise any of the lessons learnt through the rehabilitative programmes that he would have undergone during his two-year residential stay at the BT. It is unfortunate that his parents’ attempt in rehabilitating him had clearly failed as I note that the accused was discharged from BT for about a year, following which these current offences were committed[^17].

60     The prosecution contended that the accused’s role was more than just a courier whereas the defence argued that he had a limited role in re-packing the drugs and had no hand in selling the drugs for profit. Arguably, the role of the courier can be said to be less culpable than someone who re-packed the drugs and thereafter sold them. However, I did not think that the accused’s role of re-packing the drugs which would have been delivered back to “Melvin”, was any more aggravating than the role of the courier, namely, the co-accused. Both were vital cogs in the drug trafficking business, which was well-organised as evident from the specific instructions which the accused had received from “Melvin” in taking delivery of the drugs, to the re-packing and delivery of the re-packed drugs to a specific location thereafter. As such, the individual sentences to be imposed on the accused (notwithstanding his young age) should thus not deviate too far off from what Goh had received.

#### Attempt to Dispose of Evidence

61     Further, I took into account the fact that the accused attempted to dispose of the evidence of his offences by throwing the black haversack (containing the drugs which he is currently charged with), which Goh, had delivered at the material time. The accused was clearly cognisant of the seriousness of the offences that he had committed when he realised that the CNB officers were outside his unit, and in that regard, I found this to be an aggravating factor as the accused was clearly attempting to avoid prosecution or a heavier sentence (see _Vasentha’s_ case at \[69\]).

#### Not One-Off Incident

62     I also note that this is not the first time the accused had repacked the drugs for “Melvin”. He had admitted doing this previously in October 2016 (namely, a month prior to his current arrest), which resulted in clearing $1,200 of his debt. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the current offences were a ‘one-off’ incident. As stated in _Vasentha_ at \[59\], the fact that the offender was involved in criminal activities for a period of time prior to his arrest can only be used to negate the mitigating weight of the offender’s assertion that it was his first or only offence (see _Louis Joseph Marie Gerard Tyack v Mauritius_ \[2006\] UKPC 18 at \[21\] and \[31\]). The accused was thus a first offender only in the sense that he did not have any antecedents (see _Vasentha_ at \[81\]).

#### TIC Charges

63     The defence contended that the TIC charges should carry little weight as they related to the same transaction and referred to the case of _Ravan._ As noted in _Suventher_ in \[39\], outstanding offences which are taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing are to be treated as aggravating the offence or offences proceeded with. This is especially so where the offences taken into consideration are similar to the principal offences.

64     I did not think that the facts of the current case were similar to that of _Ravan’s_ case. The accused in _Ravan_ was charged for abetting by intentionally aiding “Ilango” to weigh and cut the _original three blocks_ containing the cannabis, which he knew “Ilango” possessed for the purpose of trafficking. Two other charges were taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing – one of abetting “Ilango” in trafficking not less than 999.99g of cannabis mixture and another for joint possession for the purpose of trafficking 83.05g of cannabis found in 34 small packets (which were fragments from the original three blocks). _All the charges relate to the original three blocks of cannabis_ whereas in the current case, the TIC charges relate to _other_ variety of drugs apart from cannabis, methamphetamine or nimetazepam found in the proceeded charges.

65     Having considered the aggravating factors as well as the mitigating factors highlighted in \[54\] above, I was of the view that the sentence for the trafficking of cannabis charge of 23 years’ imprisonment was an appropriate one, having calibrated it downwards from 28 years’ imprisonment as the starting point.

66     This was also consistent with the case of _Suventher_ (supra) where the accused, aged 22 years old at the time of the offences, pleaded guilty to one charge of importing into Singapore not less than 499.9g of cannabis, an offence under s 7 of the MDA and was sentenced to 23 years’ imprisonment and the mandatory caning of 15 strokes of the cane. He also admitted to a second and similar charge of importing not less than 999.9g of cannabis mixture and consented to it being taken into consideration. Although the accused was a first offender, the High Court noted that the accused had committed the offence for easy money despite being gainfully employed at the time of the offence. The accused also pleaded guilty only after being arrested in very incriminating circumstances and neither did he assist the investigators to apprehend the person who was to collect the drugs from him when he was first asked to do so in the CNB follow-up operation (see _Suventher_ at \[9\]). Further, the sentence for the importation of cannabis was enhanced on account of the offence for unauthorised importation of cannabis mixture that was taken into consideration. The Court of Appeal (“CA”) dismissed the appellant’s appeal.

67     In the current case, the accused was 18 years old at the material time, whereas the accused in _Suventher_ was 22 years old. I did not think that their respective ages differed so greatly that a further downward adjustment be given from the starting indicative sentence of 28 years to the minimum mandatory sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment was justified, especially since the accused in the current case had four other trafficking charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

68     As observed by the CA in _Suventher’s_ case at \[25\], the minimum mandatory sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment was imposed on the following two cases, namely, that of _PP v Vasanthakumar a/l Balasubramaniam_, Criminal Case No. 26 of 2012 (“_Vasanthakumar_”) and _PP v Sundar Arujunan_ Criminal Case No. 17 of 2007 (“_Sundar Arujunan_”) given their respective exceptional mitigating circumstances.

69     In _Vasanthakumar_, the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of trafficking 499g of cannabis. A second charge of trafficking 324.4g of cannabis mixture was taken into consideration. In mitigation, the accused had a genetic risk of developing muscular dystrophy and had feminine tendencies such that incarceration in a male institution, would have a psychological effect on him. In _Sundar Arujunan_, the accused pleaded guilty to two charges: one for the offence of trafficking not less than 499.99g of cannabis and another for trafficking not less than 999.99g of vegetable matter which was found to contain tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabinol. It was highlighted in mitigation that the accused had an IQ of 62, was mildly retarded and had deficits of assessment in social situations which resulted in him being easily manipulated by others.

70     In the absence of such exceptional mitigating factors as above, I did not think that the accused’s relative young age was such an exceptional mitigating factor either as to necessitate a significant downward calibration of the starting indicative sentence to the minimum mandatory imprisonment term. This was also especially in light of the aggravating factors which I have highlighted above.

71     I now turn to the trafficking of methamphetamine charge. In determining the sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment, I similarly took into account the abovementioned factors to calibrate the sentence downwards from the starting indicative sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment. For the same reasons highlighted above, I did not think that the minimum mandatory sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate either in view of the accused’s culpability as well as the multiple charges which were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

72     Further, a sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment for the current trafficking of methamphetamine charge would not have been very far off from the sentence meted out for _Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai_ where the latter was sentenced to 22 years’ imprisonment. This was notwithstanding the fact that the amount of methamphetamine in the current case was lower than that in _Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai’s_ case. However, the current accused faced four TIC charges whereas _Nguyen Thi Thanh Hai_ faced one single charge of importation of methamphetamine. I was thus of the view that this would have necessitated a slight uplift from the sentence of 22 years’ imprisonment to justify a sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment.

### Trafficking of Nimetazepam (“Class C” Drug)

73     The defence had sought for the minimum mandatory imprisonment term of 2 years and the minimum mandatory caning for this charge, which I agreed. Nonetheless, I saw it fit to explain my reasons in any event.

74     In view of the sheer number of tablets involved for this charge, namely, that of 1999, a sentence above the minimum of 2 years’ imprisonment would have been justified. However, I did not think that it necessitated a 3-year imprisonment term similar to that which was imposed in _Norhisham’s_ case. The current facts could be distinguished from _Norhisham_, which was cited by the prosecution. One of the charges in _Norhisham’s_ case involved trafficking of 220 tablets of methamphetamine, which was significantly lower than the current case. The accused in _Norhisham_ was also active in the drug trafficking trade and had ‘frequent dealings’ with ‘Jack’ whom he had purchased drugs from and which he sold to make profits subsequently (see _Norhisham_ at \[17\]). Furthermore, he was 29 years old, had previous drug related convictions and had also committed the drug offences soon after he was released from serving a 10-year imprisonment term for culpable homicide not amounting to murder (see _Norhisham_ at \[22\]). The current accused was a first offender and a young offender. Further, he was not selling the drugs as a business per se. A sentence of about 2 years’ 6 months’ imprisonment would have sufficed in the circumstances.

75     That said, I also note that Goh also received the minimum mandatory sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for the same charge. As I was going to order this sentence to run consecutively to that of the trafficking of cannabis charge, I determined that the sentence for the trafficking of nimetazepam charge could be adjusted lower to the minimum mandatory sentence of 2 years such that the overall sentence would not be too crushing.

## Conclusion

76     Despite the deterrent sentences being meted out by the courts for drug trafficking offences, the war against drugs seem to be far from being abated. In the Parliamentary Report on 4 April 2017 on “_Strengthening Singapore’s Fight Against Drugs_” (Volume 94), Mr Christopher de Souza (“Mr de Souza”), Member of Parliament, noted the incremental increase of cannabis seized from 2014 to 2016[^18] as follows:

In 2014, the amount of cannabis seized spiked by 125% from 15kg in 2013 to 35kg in 2014. The next year, 2015, the demand for cannabis increased. For the first time, cannabis became the second most commonly abused drug among new abusers on Singapore. That year, there was about a 26% increase in cannabis seized from 35kg to 44.3 kg. One year later, in 2016, the amount of cannabis seized continued to rise significantly. According to provisional statistics, during the first six months of 2016, the amount of cannabis seized was almost the same amount for the entire year of 2015. The data showed that over the entire year, the amount of cannabis seized increased by another 22% from 2015 to 2016.

77     Parliament’s intention is clear in that in order to stem the supply of drugs, tough laws are needed to deter the potential drug trafficker. As noted by Mr de Souza in the same report, “After all, drug trafficking is, for the most part, pre-meditated. It is a coldly calculated risk between potential profit and potential punishment”.

78     Thus, in order to deter the drug trafficking trade to continue to take root on our shores and have its pernicious effects destroy the lives of many, including the young, who are lured by quick money to solve their financial woes, the sentences must reflect society’s disapprobation for such offences.

79     For the reasons stated above, I ordered the sentences for the trafficking of cannabis charge and trafficking of nimetazepam charge to run consecutively, to give effect to the aggregate sentence of 25 years’ imprisonment, which was not overly crushing given the circumstances. This was in addition to the 24 strokes of the cane which was not in dispute. The sentence was further backdated to 4 November 2016, the date on which the accused was remanded. I can do no better than what the appellant’s counsel in _Katty Soh’s_ case had stated and adopted by Chan J at \[72\], in referring to the relatively young 23-year old appellant, and for which it would be equally applicable to the current accused: he has made his bed and is now sleeping on it, but the length of his sentence should allow him enough time to get up and see the dawn of a new day, rather than for him to get up just in time to see the sun set on him.

80     With the accused’s willingness to mend his ways and to further his studies now, his time served can nonetheless be constructively utilised if he makes full use of the opportunities offered to participate in the rehabilitative programmes available to all prison inmates, aimed at reintegrating accused persons into society (see _PP v Sim Yeow Kee v PP & Anor_ at \[80\] and _Praveen_ at \[28\]).

_The accused was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane._
