24 April 2019

### District Judge Edgar Foo:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 43-year-old Singaporean male, had faced a total of 6 charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”)(Cap 185) and all these matters were fixed for hearing before me on 4 April 2019.

2       On the day of the trial, the Prosecution offered to proceed on 3 charges, and to take into consideration 2 charges and to withdraw 1 charge after a stern warning if the accused took a certain course.

3       The accused decided to accept the prosecution’s offer and he pleaded guilty to the following charges on 4 April 2019:-

> i.     1 charge under DAC 908709-2018 for possession of methamphetamine which is a Class A Controlled drug for the purpose trafficking under section 5(10(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) (Cap 185) punishable under section 33(1) of the same Act;

> ii.     1 charge under DAC 912863-2018 for consumption of methamphetamine which is a Class A Controlled drug under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, after having been convicted of an earlier offence of consumption of methamphetamine conviction, and punishable under section 33(4) of the same Act; and

> iii.     1 charge under DAC 915418-2018 for possession of ketamine which is a Class A Controlled drug under section 8(a) of the MDA, which is punishable under section 33(1) of the same Act.

4       2 other charges were taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing, namely, 1 charges under DAC 915420-2018 for possession of MDMA which is a Class A Controlled drug under section 8(a) of the MDA and 1 charge under DAC 915421-2018 for possession of drug utensils under section 9 of the MDA.

5       As for the last charge DAC 915419-2018, I stood down the charge and fixed it for pre-trial conference on another date for the stern warning to be administered to the accused before Prosecution withdraws the charge.

6       I sentenced the accused to an aggregate imprisonment term of 6 years and 18 months and 6 strokes of the cane. As the accused has been in remand since 7 March 2018, I also ordered the sentence to take effect from 7 March 2018.

7       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision has filed an appeal against my sentence.

The accused and the abovementioned seized exhibits were brought back to CNB headquarters to assist with investigations.

## Facts pertaining to trafficking of methamphetamine (DAC-908709-2018) and possession of ketamine (DAC-915418/2018)

15     The exhibits “RA-A”, “RA-E1A”, “RA-E1B”, “RA-E2A1”, “RA-E2A2”, and “RAE2D” subsequently submitted to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") for analysis at 2.50 p.m. on 8 March 2018.

17     On 16 April 2018, Yeo Yuan Yuan Cheryl, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of HSA issued six certificates under Section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap. 185 stating the following:

> a.     Lab. No. ID-1832-00469-001: The exhibit marked “RA-A” was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.26 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.17 gram of methamphetamine.

21     Methamphetamine and ketamine are Class A Controlled Drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

22     The accused is not authorized under the MDA of the Regulations made thereunder to traffic in a Controlled Drug or to possess a Controlled Drug.

23     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence of possession of 77.56 grams of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA. The accused has also committed an offence of possession of 53.13 grams of ketamine, an offence under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

28     Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

29     Investigations revealed that on or about few days prior to arrest, the accused had consumed ‘ice’, which is the street name for Methamphetamine. The accused consumed ‘ice’ using an improvised bottle. He would scoop ‘ice’ into a Popeye attached to a glass bottle and heat up the ‘ice’ with a lighter. Next, he would smoke the fumes through a rubber tube attached to the glass bottle. The accused’s urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine as a result of his consumption of “ice”.

30     The accused is not authorized to consume Methamphetamine, a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder.

Chao JA had considered the benchmarks laid down by Sunderesh Menon CJ in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> for trafficking of diamorphine and he had made the following comments \[at 13 to 23\]:-

>> 13    All that remains for consideration is the sentence for the trafficking charge. In my view, the proper starting point in determining the appropriate sentence is the quantity of methamphetamine trafficked. This is because, as Sundaresh Menon CJ noted in the very recent decision of _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”), the sentencing framework in the MDA for drug trafficking “rests primarily on the _type_ and _quantity_ of the drugs” (at \[14\]), meaning that “the quantity of drugs involved in a trafficking charge will inevitably have a strong bearing on the sentence to be imposed in any given case” – a sensible approach given that “the quantity of the drugs will usually be proportionate to the harm” that would be caused to society, and would thus serve “as a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the offence” (at \[23\]).

>> _Guidance from the indicative starting points for first-time offenders_

>> 14    In _Vasentha_, Menon CJ further developed this notion of a correlation between the quantity of drugs trafficked and the sentences to be imposed by establishing the following “indicative starting points” for sentencing first time offenders trafficking in diamorphine (which his case was concerned with) according to the quantity of diamorphine trafficked (at \[47\]):

>> 15    These indicative starting points pronounced in _Vasentha_ are of course not strictly applicable to the appellant in this case since he is not a first-time offender. Moreover, Menon CJ took pains to emphasise that the indicative starting points were not determinative of the sentence but would have to be adjusted where appropriate “to reflect the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances” (at \[48\]), such as whether the offender was directing the drug trade on a commercial scale, or involving others in the operation, or motivated by financial or other advantage, or performing only a limited function under direction (at \[51\]). Indeed, on the facts of that case, Menon CJ thought that “a significant reduction from the indicative starting point” would be warranted (at \[80\]).

>> 16    Nevertheless, I think it is appropriate for me to take some measure of guidance from the indicative starting points in _Vasentha_. There is no reason why the quantity of drugs trafficked should not be a vital determinant in sentencing repeat offenders as it is in sentencing first-time offenders; I cannot imagine it was Parliament’s design in enacting s 33(4A) of the MDA to diminish the relevance of that factor. The indicative starting points in _Vasentha_ demonstrate, in a rough and general way, the proper relationship between the quantity of drugs trafficked and the sentence to be imposed, bearing in mind the need to utilise the full sentencing range prescribed by the statute. Since this relationship holds in cases involving repeat trafficking offenders, _Vasentha_ is pertinent even in the present appeal. Let me explain.

>> _Indicative starting points where the drug trafficked is methamphetamine_

>> 17    I am cognisant of the fact that the drug trafficked in _Vasentha_ was diamorphine whereas the drug in this case was methamphetamine. Trafficking one gram of diamorphine is of course not necessarily equivalent to trafficking one gram of methamphetamine. But I consider that it is possible to derive some sort of conversion scale, or “exchange rate”, so to speak, between diamorphine and methamphetamine. This is because the Second Schedule of the MDA prescribes the exact same minimum and maximum punishments for trafficking between 10g and 15g of diamorphine and trafficking between 167g and 250g of methamphetamine – the minimum is 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and the maximum is imprisonment for life or 30 years and 15 strokes of the cane. This means that, all other things being equal, an offender who traffics between 10g and 15g of diamorphine is to be considered _as culpable as_ a person who traffics between 167g and 250g of methamphetamine. **Doing the arithmetic, the culpability of an offender who traffics one gram of diamorphine is equivalent to the culpability of an identically-situated offender who traffics 16.7g of methamphetamine**.

>> 18    In the present case, the quantity of methamphetamine trafficked was 11.64g. That is not a large amount, as the District Judge himself noted (at \[14\] of the GD (\[9\] _supra_)). Applying the conversion scale which I have indicated in the preceding paragraph, trafficking 11.64g of methamphetamine is an act of equivalent culpability to trafficking 0.70g of diamorphine. Returning to the indicative starting points in _Vasentha_, that quantity of diamorphine would fall within the _lower end_ of the _lowest band_ encompassing quantities under 3g. Had the appellant in this case been a first-time offender, the indicative starting point for trafficking 11.64g of methamphetamine would thus have been five to six years’ imprisonment and five to six strokes of the cane.

>> _Precedents involving first-time traffickers in methamphetamine_

>> 19    The Prosecution has brought to my attention two precedents in which first-time traffickers who dealt in similar quantities of methamphetamine were given sentences that exceeded this indicative starting point for the lowest band indicated in _Vasentha_ (\[13\] _supra_) by a substantial amount. To that extent these precedents might appear at first glance to be inconsistent with the indicative starting points in _Vasentha_. In _PP v Ng Kian Hoe_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 364</span> (“_Ng Kian Hoe_”), the offender was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for trafficking 19.77g of methamphetamine. He appealed against sentence but I dismissed the appeal in January 2013. In _Seah Soon Huat William v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 366</span> (“_Seah William_”), the offender was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for trafficking 20.69g of methamphetamine. He lodged an appeal but subsequently withdrew it.

>> 20    In my view, _Ng Kian Hoe_ and _Seah William_ do not suggest that the indicative starting points suggested in _Vasentha_ are inapplicable where the drug trafficked is methamphetamine and not diamorphine. On the premise that trafficking about 20g of methamphetamine is of equal culpability to trafficking 1.20g of diamorphine such that the indicative starting point is five to six years’ imprisonment and five to six strokes of the cane, the circumstances of those two precedents disclose significant aggravating factors that provide ample justification for going well beyond that starting point. In _Ng Kian Hoe_, the key aggravating factor was that the offender “had an established pattern of procuring and selling his drugs” for profit and was not merely a “naive or inexperienced dealer” (at \[14\]–\[15\]). In _Seah William_, the key aggravating factor was that the offender had “jumped bail” and failed to attend the mention at which he was to have pleaded guilty, and had committed his trafficking offence while on the run (at \[15\]).

>> 21    That said, I should express reservations about observations that were made in these two precedents. In _Ng Kian Hoe_, the district judge expressed the view that the quantity of methamphetamine trafficked – 19.77g – was “fairly high” (at \[14\]), and in _Seah William_, the district judge opined that 20.69g of the drug was a “large” quantity (at \[14\]). With respect, I do not think the district judges were quite correct to characterise the quantity of methamphetamine trafficked in that manner. Although 20g of methamphetamine is not an insignificant amount, it is not large either. As I have said, it would fall within the _lowest band_ of indicative starting points mentioned in _Vasentha_, and it is in this context that the seriousness of trafficking that quantity of methamphetamine should be assessed.

>> **_The indicative starting point and aggravating factors in this case_**

>> 22    Returning to the present case, I reiterate that, had the appellant been a first-time offender, the indicative starting point for trafficking 11.64g of methamphetamine would have been that for the lowest band pronounced in _Vasentha_, which is five to six years’ imprisonment and five to six strokes of the cane. Given this position, I think that the indicative starting point for trafficking that quantity of methamphetamine for a repeat offender would be very close to the mandatory minimum of ten years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane stipulated by s 33(4A) of the MDA, if not the minimum itself.

>> 23    Therefore, given the small quantity of methamphetamine trafficked by the appellant, there has to be good reason to impose a sentence that exceeds the mandatory minimum by a significant amount of six years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.

> b.    Prosecution had also submitted that Chan Seng Onn J had revitalised the imprisonment and caning benchmark for trafficking of diamorphine in _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 260</span>. Chan J had \[at 44 to 45 and 55\] laid down the new benchmarks as follows:-

>> 45    I highlight that this table only indicates the sentences at certain specific weight points. Therefore, if a particular offence involves a weight of diamorphine that falls in between these weight points, a sentencing judge applying this framework should interpolate linearly from the figures set out above to obtain the appropriate indicative sentence. Alternatively, the sentencing judge could obtain the appropriate indicative sentence by referring to and simply reading off from the graphs at \[38\] above as modified by the various dotted lines…

>> **_The need for coherence and consistency_**

>> 56    At first blush, it may seem as though the sentencing framework which I have formulated above causes the sentencing exercise to become overly rigid and mechanistic. However, I emphasise that the sentencing judge still retains the final discretion in first determining the amount of uplift to impose, and second in calibrating the final sentence based on other aggravating and mitigating factors. This is because the framework set out here only applies to the identification of an indicative starting sentence. In my view, this strikes a proper balance between having consistency in sentencing on one hand, and allowing for sentences to be tailored according to the unique facts of each case on the other.

## Mitigation

34     Mr Skandarajah, the Defence Counsel had tendered a written note by the accused’s wife as part of the accused’s mitigation plea. Mr Skandarajah had also made the following oral mitigation on behalf of the accused :-

> i.     The accused is married with 3 children, aged 12, 9 and 1 years old.

> ii.     The 2nd child who is 9 years old is suffering from kidney failure and the accused’s wife has to devote all her time to care of the child. This has resulted in her not being able to work and the family is currently on welfare.

> iii.     The accused has pleaded guilty to the offences and he realises the severity of the offences and he promise not to repeat the offences again.

35     I have also considered the contents of the accused’s wife written note which included a medical report on the 2nd son’s condition. The accused’s wife is urging me to be lenient in my sentencing given her 2nd son’s condition and their financial situation.

36     In terms of sentence, Mr Skandarajah had requested the court to impose a global sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment on the accused. I note that Mr Skandarajah did not disagree with the Prosecution’s proposed sentence in relation to the trafficking and the consumption charge. Mr Skandarajah also did not object to the Prosecution’s proposal of 6 strokes of the cane for the trafficking charge. However, Mr Skandarajah did suggest a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for the possession charge as compared to the 12 months as proposed by the Prosecution.

## My Sentence

37     Having considered all the facts before me, including the Prosecution’s submissions and the accused’s antecedents and mitigation, I imposed the following sentence on the accused:

## For DAC 908709-2018

38     I accept the current sentencing positon for trafficking of diamorphine as laid out in _Soh Qiu Xia Kitty._ I also accept the conversion scale between diamorphine and methamphetamine as laid out by Chao JA in _Loo Pei Xiang Alan._ In the present case, the accused was found with 77.56 g of methamphetamine. Using the conversion rate of 1 g of diamorphine to 16.7 g of methamphetamine, the culpability of the accused in this case would be equivalent to that of an offender who had trafficked 4.64 g of diamorphine. And using the indicative table prepared by Chan J in _Soh Qiu Xia Kitty_, the starting sentence of a notional 1st offender who traffic 4.64 g of diamorphine is 6 years 6 months and 6 strokes of the cane.

39     In the present case, even though the accused has a previous conviction for consumption of drugs, he does not have any trafficking antecedent and he can be taken as a 1st offender in this respect. As such, I had imposed a sentence of 6 years and 6 months and 6 strokes for the trafficking charge.

## For DAC 912863-2018

40     For DAC 912863-2018, the minimum sentence in law is 3 years. Prosecution had sought the minimum and I proceeded to sentence the accused to the minimum sentence in law which is 3 years’ imprisonment.

## For DAC 915418-2018

41     With regard to DAC 915418-208, the accused is charged with possession of 53.13 g of ketamine. Ketamine is a Class A controlled drug. The offence of possession of ketamine carries a maximum imprisonment term of 10 years or $20,000 fine or both for the 1st offence and a minimum mandatory sentence of 2 years for subsequent offence.

42     As for the sentencing tariff for possession of drugs, I note the commentaries of the authors of the Practitioners’ Library – Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, Third Edition \[at page 1176\]:-

> “The offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or $20,000 fine or both for a first offence. A second or subsequent offence carries a minimum mandatory sentence of two years’ imprisonment. The minimum sentence for repeat offender is regardless of the quantity or type of drug involved.

> Deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle. The sentence is generally pegged to the quantity and type of drug involved and the criminal record of the accused. Hence, the greater the quantity, the longer the sentence, whiles possession of Class A drugs would be more serious than Class C drugs.

> The guideline decision in _Ooi Joo Keong v PP_ \[1996\] 3 SLR (R) 866, set the benchmark for first-time consumption offenders of Class A drugs at 12 to 18 months’ imprisonment. Although this case dealt with consumption, similar benchmark sentences were applied for offender in cases involving the possession of Class A drugs.

> This benchmark was modified by the case of _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ \[2005\] 2 SLR (R) 1, in which it was held that a first offender who consumed the drug on a one-off occasion without payment could be given an eight-month imprisonment term. This could go as low as six months for a young offender; see _PP v Yap Boon Tiong_ (MA 349/1996). Cases for possession of Class A drugs after _Dinesh’s_ case have followed the range of six to 18 months: see _Nathan Sandy Darren v PP_ \[2007\]SGDC 275; _PP v Choi Byeongkuk_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 6</span>.

43     In the present case, the accused is not a young offender nor is he a one-off offender. The amount of ketamine seized is also not small. It consists of 19 packets containing not less than 178.84 g of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 53.13 g of ketamine. I also note that accused has a previous conviction of consumption of drug and he also has another charge of possession of MDMA which is a Class A controlled drug which was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

44     Given the above factors, I am of the view that a fair and reasonable sentence for DAC 915418-2018 would be 12 months’ imprisonment.

## Total Aggregate Sentence

45     In the present, the accused was convicted of 3 distinct charges. Under section 307 of the CPC, if a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court must order at least 2 of the sentences to run consecutively.

46     In the present case, if I were to order the trafficking and the consumption charge to run consecutive, the total sentence would be 9 years and 6 months and 6 strokes of the cane. I am of the view that an aggregate sentence of 9 years 6 months and 6 strokes of the cane would be excessive and crushing on the accused.

47     I therefore ordered the trafficking and possession charge to run consecutive giving a total sentence of 6 years and 18 months and 6 strokes of the cane. I am of the view that there is no need for me to calibrate this overall sentence as it does not offend the totality principle. In this regard, I am of the view that the accused’s family circumstances is not a good enough reason for me to lower the overall sentence imposed. As for the accused’s plea of guilt, I also note the accused had only pleaded guilty to the charges on the day of the trial.

48     I noted that the accused has been remanded since 7 March 2018. As such, I decided to backdate the accused’s sentence to 7 March 2018.

49     The accused is currently serving sentence pending appeal.
