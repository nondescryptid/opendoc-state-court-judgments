\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/RAS 18/2022.\]

29 July 2022

### District Judge Clement Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       The present appeal arose out of the Plaintiff’s application by way of DC/SUM 4931/2021 in DC/DC 2114/2021 for summary judgment to be entered against the Defendant in the sum of $149,173.88, plus interest and costs, on the ground that the Defendant has no defence to the Plaintiff’s claim. Deputy Registrar Jonathan Toh (the “**DR**”) heard the application at first instance and entered summary judgement in the Plaintiff’s favour for the full amount claimed, and further declined to stay the enforcement of the claim pending the disposal of the Defendant’s counterclaim.

2       The Defendant appealed against the learned DR’s decision by way of DC/RA 30/2022 (the “**RA**”) which came before me. After hearing the parties’ submissions, I affirmed the DR’s decision. As the Defendant has since filed a further appeal against my decision, I set out the grounds of my decision below.

## Background Facts

### The Parties

3       The Plaintiff is a manufacturer and supplier of mattresses and bed frames, and operates a factory located at 28 Senoko Loop, Singapore 758161.

4       The Defendant is in the business of retail sale of furniture and furnishing products. The Defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of TT International Limited (“**TT International**”). TT International is the holding company of a group of companies that includes Novena Furnishing Centre Pte. Ltd. As part of the arrangement within the group of companies, the Defendant markets and sells the “**Novena**” brand of furniture.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

5       As part of its business, the Defendant manages showrooms at which it displays its goods procured from different suppliers. The Defendant’s customers would visit its showrooms and place orders for the purchase of furniture and furnishing products.

### The Business Arrangements between the Plaintiff and Defendant

6       In or around November 2014, the Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a verbal agreement (the “**Agreement**”) under which the Plaintiff was allotted space within the Defendant’s showrooms located at 47 Sungei Kadut Avenue, Level 2, Singapore 729670 and 5 Little Road, #02-02, Singapore 536983 (the “**Defendant’s Showrooms**”). The allotted spaced was used by the Plaintiff to display “Princebed” brand bedframes and mattresses manufactured by the Plaintiff.

7       As part of the Agreement, parties also came to a business arrangement whereby the Defendant would buy the goods ordered by their customers from the Plaintiff (the “**Goods**”) to resell to their customers. The broad arrangements were as follows:

> (a)     The Defendant’s customers would visit the Defendant’s Showrooms and place orders for the Goods with the Defendant;

> (b)     The Defendant will collect full payments from its customers for their purchase of the Goods and issue Order Confirmations to the said customers;

> (c)     The Defendant would purchase the Goods from the Plaintiff to fulfil the orders placed by the Defendant’s customers;

> (d)     The Goods purchased by the Defendant would be delivered to its customers by the Plaintiff;

> (e)     Upon delivery of the Goods to the Defendant’s customers, any balance payment owed by its customers would either be paid to the Defendant directly or the Plaintiff’s delivery personnel would collect cheques from the Defendant’s customer on behalf of the Defendant; and.

> (f)     Invoices would be generated by the Plaintiff after the delivery of the Goods.

8       An agreed sum was paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant every month as advertisement and rental support for the space allotted to the Plaintiff in the Defendant’s Showrooms (the “Subsidy”). The Defendant would deduct the Subsidy from any payments to be made by the Defendant to the Plaintiff for the sale of Goods to the Defendant. Nothing in the present application turned on the Subsidy[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2).

### Delay in payments

9       It was not disputed that a credit term of 60 days applied to the Plaintiff’s invoices. It is the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendant had delayed payments for the Goods for periods far beyond the credit term period.

10     According to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff’s manager, one Tay Kong Shing (“**Mr Tay**”), spoke to the Defendant’s manager, one Sng Yi (“**Mr Sng**”), on many occasions requesting the Defendant to abide by the payment terms. When the Defendant persistently failed to do so, the Plaintiff instructed their solicitors, M/s Chambers Law LLP, to issue a letter of demand dated 9 July 2021 (the “**1st LOD**”) to claim for the unpaid price of Goods sold to the Defendant. The sum claimed under the 1st LOD was $191,825.12.

11     After the 1st LOD was sent by the Plaintiff’s solicitors, by an email dated 15 July 2021, Mr Sng, on behalf of the Defendant proposed to pay the outstanding debt, by weekly instalments of $15,000, commencing from 21 July 2021. A condition of the instalment payments stipulated by the Defendant was that the Plaintiff would withdraw the 1st LOD before 21 July 2021. A copy of Mr Sng’s email of 15 July 2021 is exhibited to Mr Tay’s 1st affidavit dated 22 December 2021 at Exhibit TKS-6.

12     The Plaintiff asserted that out of business goodwill, it agreed to accede to the Defendant’s instalment request, but not to the withdrawing of the 1st LOD. When the Plaintiff did not withdraw the 1st LOD, the Defendant refused to commence the instalment payments on 21 July 2021.

13     According to the Plaintiff, in the late afternoon of 21 July 2021, Mr Sng called Mr Tay and told Mr Tay to remove all the Plaintiff’s goods at the Defendant’s Showrooms by the end of July 2021. Mr Sng also told Mr Tay that with effect from 22nd July 2021, the Plaintiff’s sales promoters could not continue to work at the Defendant’s Showrooms.

14     Pursuant to Mr Sng’s directions, the Plaintiff brought back their goods and withdrew their sales promoters from the Defendant’s Showrooms, bringing the Agreement to an end.

15     Thereafter, the Defendant called up their customers who had purchased the Goods from the Defendant’s Showrooms to cancel their purchase and/or change the Plaintiff’s goods they had ordered to other brands or to purchase other products.

16     The Plaintiff thereafter made further demands for payments on 16 August 2021 (the “**2nd LOD**”) and on 10 September 2021 (the “**3rd LOD**”) respectively. When the Defendant did not respond to the 3rd LOD, the Plaintiff initiated the present action on 5 October 2021.

## The Procedural History

### The Statement of Claim

17     The Plaintiff’s Writ with the Statement of Claim (“**SOC**”) endorsed thereon was filed on 5 October 2021. In Paragraph 7 of the SOC, the Plaintiff claimed the sum of $149,173.88 in respect of goods sold to the Defendant and delivered to the Defendant’s customers upon the Defendant’s instructions (the “**Claimed Amount**”). A breakdown of the sum of $149,173.88 was set out in paragraph 7 of the SOC.

### The Original Defence and Counterclaim

18     The Defendant filed its original Defence and Counterclaim on 29 October 2021. In its original Defence, the Defendant did not raise a specific Defence to the Plaintiff’s claim, and merely put the Plaintiff to strict proof of the Claimed Amount.

19     In the Defendant’s original Counterclaim, the Defendant cross-claimed a sum of $89,542.00 in respect of losses allegedly suffered arising from the Plaintiff’s failure and/or delay in the delivery of goods. The Defendant claimed that the losses arose from the following:

> (a)     Loss of sales due to cancellation of orders by customers caused by the Plaintiff’s failure and/or delays in delivering the said goods;

> (b)     Costs and expenses incurred by the Defendant in sourcing and arranging for alternative service providers and replacement products to fulfil existing orders to customers, which the Plaintiff had been contractually obligated to fulfil; and

> (c)     Costs and expenses incurred by the Defendant in salvaging its relationships with customers and protection of its reputation which includes, inter alia, offering additional discounts, rebates, vouchers, free gifts, and product upgrades to affected customers.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

20     No set off was pleaded in the Original Defence and Counterclaim.

### The Amended Defence and Counterclaim

21     The RA first came for hearing before me on 25 April 2022. Defence Counsel intimated at the hearing that he wished to amend the Defence and Counterclaim. The RA was then adjourned for further hearing pending the hearing of DC/SUM 1391/2022, which was the Defendant’s application to amend their Defence and Counterclaim.

22     DC/SUM 1391/2022 was heard on 12 May 2022 by a Deputy Registrar who granted the Defendant leave to amend the Defence and Counterclaim. The amended Defence and Counterclaim was filed on 19 May 2022 and the amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim was filed on 9 June 2022.

23     The Amended Defence and Counterclaim contained very substantial amendments. The key changes for present purposes are:

> (a)     The Plaintiff pleaded for the first time that: (i) once the Defendant has issued an Order of Confirmation to the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff _must_ fulfil the orders placed by the Defendant’s customers[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4); and (ii) the Plaintiff is required to deliver the Goods to the Defendant’s customers by the requested delivery date. Time is of essence under the Agreement[^5];

> (b)     In addition to the three heads of losses itemised in paragraph 11 of the Original Defence and Counterclaim (see \[19\] above), the Defendant added in the Amended Defence and Counterclaim a further head of claim for “Losses arising out of loss of business reputation and/or goodwill and/or future profits[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6);

> (c)     The Defendant drew a distinction between “fulfilled” and “unfulfilled” orders transacted under the Agreement. The Defendant stated that out of a total of 287 orders transacted between the Plaintiff and Defendant under the Agreement, the Plaintiff was able to fulfil 187 orders, for which an amount of $149,173.88 remains outstanding (“**Outstanding Amount**”). The Defendant, however, pleaded that the Plaintiff had unilaterally suspended a significant portion of deliveries that were to be fulfilled, comprising approximately 100 out of the 287 orders (the “**unfulfilled orders**”), thereby causing the Defendant to suffer losses[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7): see \[26\] below. All losses claimed by the Defendant were in respect of the “unfulfilled” orders[^8]. The Defendant claimed to be entitled to set off the Outstanding Amount with the counterclaimed amounts.

## The Applicable Law

24     The principles to be applied in determining whether to grant summary judgment are well settled. The burden lies on the plaintiff to show that he has a _prima facie_ case for summary judgment. If he fails to do so, then his application will be dismissed with costs consequences. Once the plaintiff has crossed the threshold, the tactical burden then shifts to the defendant opposing the application. In order to obtain leave to defend a defendant must “establish that there is a fair or reasonable possibility that he has a real or bona fide defence”: see _Barun Electronics Co Ltd v EYZ Infotech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 154</span> (“_Barun Electronics_”) at \[16\]-\[17\].

25     Where there is a subsisting counterclaim, the High Court in _Kim Seng Orchid Pte Ltd v Lim Kah Hin (trading as Yik Zhuan Orchid Garden)_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“_Kim Seng Orchid_”) laid out a 4-step framework to determine whether summary judgement ought to be granted (at \[98\]):

> (a)     **Step 1: whether the counterclaim is plausible** – the court should first consider whether the counterclaim is plausible, _ie_, whether it is reasonably possible for the counterclaim to succeed at trial …. If the counterclaim is _not_ plausible, then its presence ought not to stand in the way of the plaintiff obtaining summary judgment of its whole claim, without any stay pending the determination of the counterclaim, and the court should so rule. If the court finds that the counterclaim _is_ plausible, then **Step 2** follows.

> (b)     **Step 2: whether the plausible counterclaim amounts to a defence of set-off** – _the court should then determine whether the counterclaim that it has found to be plausible amounts to a defence of set-off, whether legal or equitable_. If it finds that the plausible counterclaim _does_ amount to a defence of set-off, then unconditional leave to defend should be granted in respect of the whole of the claim. The reason for such a result is that when the court reaches such a conclusion, it has found in essence that the defendant has shown reasonable grounds of a real defence, and therefore leave to defend should, on the usual principles, be granted. On the other hand, if the counterclaim does _not_ amount to a defence of set-off, then the court may proceed to **Step 3** below.

> (c)     **Step 3: whether the plausible counterclaim is sufficiently connected to the claim** – the court may then consider whether there is a connection between the claim (for which summary judgment is sought) and the counterclaim which it has considered to be plausible. _If that counterclaim arises out of quite a separate and distinct transaction or it is wholly foreign to the claim or there is no connection between the claim and counterclaim, the court should generally grant summary judgment of the whole claim, without a stay pending the determination of the unconnected counterclaim._ If the court is satisfied of the degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, it may proceed to **Step 4**.

> (d)     **Step 4: whether there are grounds for a stay of execution in the light of the connected and plausible counterclaim** – if the court considers that there is really no defence to the claim and that as a consequence the plaintiff would be put to needless expense in proving its claim, the court should generally grant summary judgment of the whole of the claim. …..

> But, in the exercise of its discretion, where the court also finds (through an application of **Steps 1** and **3** above) that there is _a connected and plausible counterclaim_, this may provide grounds for the court _to stay execution_ of the whole judgment (or a portion thereof) pending the determination of the connected and plausible counterclaim. …..

> _\[W\]hether or not a stay of the whole or a part of the judgment should be granted is ultimately a matter for the court’s discretion_, to be exercised according to established principles. _The degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, the strength and quantum of the counterclaim and the ability of the plaintiff to satisfy any judgment on the counterclaim are some of the considerations which the court may take into account in the exercise of its discretion on whether to grant a stay_: see _Singapore Civil Procedure 2016_ at para 14/4/10; and _Tru-line_ (\[84\] _supra_) at \[45\]. The exercise of the discretion to grant or to refuse to grant a stay of execution of the whole or a portion of the judgment sum pending trial of a plausible and connected counterclaim _will ultimately depend on whether the defendant is able to show that it would be fair and just in all the circumstances of the case to stay the immediate enforcement of the whole or a portion of the judgment sum_ due to the pending trial of the counterclaim. _The burden lies on the defendant to prove that the stay is justifiable having regard to all the circumstances of the case. \[Emphasis added\]_

## My Decision

### Whether Defendant has shown a real and bona fide defence for the fulfilled orders

26     I noted that in the Defendant’s Amended Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendant _clearly admitted_ that the Plaintiff had duly fulfilled some 187 orders (out of the 287 orders transacted under the Agreement), for which the Claimed Amount of $149,173.88 remains outstanding. This is evidenced by paragraph 5 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim which is reproduced in full below:

> “5.     _Paragraph 7 (and the sub-paragraphs) of the SOC_ \[Note: this refers to the Claimed Amount of $149,173.88; including a detailed breakdown\] _is admitted strictly for the outstanding amount under those fulfilled orders_. _Of the total number of 287 orders (both fulfilled and unfulfilled orders_ which were transacted between the Plaintiff and the Defendant under the Agreement), **_the Plaintiff were able to fulfil only_** approximately 65% or approximately **_187 orders, for which an amount of $149,173.88 remains outstanding_** (“**Outstanding Amount**”). As admitted by the Plaintiff in their letter dated 9 July 2021, _the Plaintiff had, without informing the Defendant, unilaterally suspended a significant portion of deliveries that were to be fulfilled_ (the “**Unfulfilled Orders**”). _The approximately_ **_100 Unfulfilled Orders form approximately 35% of total orders_** with the Plaintiff, amounting some S$ 220,945.00, **_of which_** **_the Defendant suffered a loss of $70,006.00 as stated above in paragraph 4A(c)(i) for the loss of sale (“Loss of Sales”), excluding the estimated loss of profits and damages (“Losses and Damages”)_**. _The Defendant is therefore, entitled to counterclaim the Plaintiff to compensate the_ **_Loss of Sales_**_, together with the claims for_ **_Losses and Damages_** _suffered by the Defendant_ **_for the Unfulfilled Orders_** _(collectively “_**_Counterclaim Sums_**_”)_; and entitled to set off the Outstanding Amount with the Counterclaim Sums, and that such Counterclaim Sums are sufficient to extinguish the said Outstanding Amount.” **_\[Emphasis added\]_**

27     For present purposes, it is important to note the distinction drawn between the 187 _“fulfilled orders”_ and the 100 _“unfulfilled orders”_ by the Defendant in the Amended Defence and Counterclaim.

28     The Plaintiff’s Claim of $149,173.88 was quantified based on the _fulfilled orders_. The relevant invoices and the Defendant’s sales orders for the fulfilled orders were collectively exhibited at Tay’s 1st affidavit at pages 18 to 439. It is clear from paragraph 7 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim that the $149,173.88 claimed by the Plaintiff in respect of the _fulfilled orders_ is not being challenged by the Defendant and remains outstanding. The Defendant’s challenge is limited to the 100 _Unfulfilled Orders_, with the “Loss of Sales” and “Losses and Damages” being losses arising in relation to the 100 _Unfulfilled Orders_.

29     This position was confirmed by the Defendant’s director, Ms Julia Tong (“**Ms Tong**”) in her second affidavit filed on 25 March 2022 (the “**Ms Tong’s Second Affidavit**”), pursuant a request from the DR for clarification as to whether the \[113\] _unfulfilled_ orders referred to in paragraph 14 of Ms Tong’s earlier affidavit dated 26 January 2022 included the invoices exhibited to the Mr Tay’s first affidavit (these were the invoices relating to the _fulfilled_ orders which accounted for the Claimed Amount). The query arose because Defence Counsel had at the first hearing before the DR stated that all the transactions in respect of the Claimed Amount had been rejected by the end users and, as such, were “unfulfilled” orders[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). In her reply affidavit dated 25 March 2022, Ms Tong however, departed from the Defence Counsel’s representation and clarified that: (i) the reference to 113 orders should be to approximately 100 orders instead; and (ii) the approximate 100 _unfulfilled_ orders were separate and _in addition to the invoices exhibited in Mr Tay’s first affidavit[^10]._ Further at paragraph 12 of the same affidavit, Ms Tong reiterated that “the approximate \[100\] invoices _\[do\] not_ refer to the invoices that were exhibited in \[Mr Tay’s\] Affidavit, save for Sales Order S) 10369961”.

30     Based on the Defendant’s Amended Defence and Counterclaim and the Ms Tong’s Second Affidavit, the Defendant has, for all intents and purposes, conceded that the sum of $149,173.88 is outstanding and owing to the Plaintiff in respect of the fulfilled orders. The proposal by Mr Sng to repay the sums owing by instalments as mentioned in paragraph \[11\] above, further corroborated this fact.

31     Based on the foregoing, I found that the Plaintiff had shown a _prima facie_ case for summary judgment for the Claimed Amount. The burden was now on the Defendant to establish that there was a fair or reasonable possibility that he had a real or bona fide defence.

### Whether Triable Issues raised

32     The Defendant, on its part, has mounted a mirror defence/counterclaim under the following heads:

> (a)     Loss of sales due to cancellation of orders by customers caused by Plaintiff’s failure or delay in delivering the goods

> (b)     Costs and expenses incurred by the Defendant in sourcing and arranging for alternates/replacement products

> (c)     Costs’ and expenses incurred by Defendant in salvaging its relationship with customers and protection of its reputation eg by granting additional discounts, rebates, vouchers, etc

> (d)     Loss of business reputation and/or good will and/or future profits.

#### The Pleadings

33     It is clear from paragraph 5 of the Defendant’s Amended Defence and Counterclaim that the Defendant is _not_ claiming he had suffered losses for the _fulfilled_ orders. Indeed, in respect of the fulfilled orders, the sum of $149,173.88 was admitted to be “outstanding”[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). Construing paragraph 5 of the Defence and Counterclaim carefully, the “Loss of Sales” and “Losses and Damages” claimed by the Defendant related to the approximately 100 _“Unfulfilled Orders”_ only. There is accordingly no specific defence raised in relation to the $149,173.88 claim for the _fulfilled_ orders. Accordingly, summary judgement ought to be entered in respect of the $149,173.88 claimed for the _fulfilled_ orders.

#### Implications of Grant of Leave to Amend Defence and Counterclaim

34     Defence Counsel next argued that the fact that the Defendant’s application to amend the Defence and Counterclaim was allowed by a DR showed that Defendant had a legally sustainable defence. Unconditional leave to defend therefore ought to be granted.

35     Defence Counsel highlighted the following observations in the case of _Mohamed Shiyam v Tuff Offshore Engineering Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC(I) 8</span>, which state that the principles to be applied in the context of an application to amend pleadings and a striking out application are the same:

> 38.     _The principles to be applied in the context of O 20 r 5 are similar to those for striking out pleadings under O 18 r 19 of the ROC_: Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew <span class="citation">\[1990\] 1 SLR(R) 337</span> at \[4\]; _….. In short, it is sufficient that the amendment discloses a “reasonable cause of action”_, which was described in Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span> … at \[21\] as:

>> _… a cause of action which has some chance of success when only the allegations in the pleading are considered. As long as the statement of claim discloses some cause of action, or raises some question fit to be decided at the trial, the mere fact that the case is weak and is not likely to succeed is no ground for striking it out_ … _\[emphasis added\]_

36     Defence Counsel sought to extrapolate from the above extract that once an amendment to the defence was allowed, it necessarily followed that a reasonable cause of action _or defence_ (as the case may be) had been disclosed. A triable issue was therefore present which would warrant unconditional leave to defend a summary judgement application.

37     I am unable to accept this argument. That the principles to be applied in an amendment of pleadings application and a striking out application are similar is uncontroversial. Defence Counsel however attempted to venture further and collapse the tests governing the amendment of pleadings, striking out applications _and show cause proceedings in an O 14 application_ into one unified test. Such a proposition is unprincipled and without legal support. Specifically, in relation to the raising of triable issues for the purposes of resisting an O 14 application, the test has never been worded so as to be in alignment with striking out applications. Defence Counsel had cited no authority to persuade me otherwise, and I had no hesitation in dismissing this argument.

### Counterclaim and set-off

38     I turn now to the Counterclaim, and examine if it gave rise to a right of set off, which might in turn provide a basis for granting unconditional leave to defend. As noted above, the 4 step framework laid down in _Kim Seng Orchid’s_ case is helpful in this regard.

### Application of the 4-step framework in Kim Seng Orchid’s case

#### Stage 1: Whether counterclaim is plausible

39     I am prepared to find, for present purposes, that the Defendant has a plausible counterclaim based on the affidavit evidence before me, _specifically in relation to the unfulfilled orders_.

40     I first noted that the Agreement in question was not reduced into writing. There were two alleged terms which might potentially support the Defendant’s counterclaim: first, whether the back-to-back contracts ‒ between the Defendant and its end customers on the one hand, and between the Defendant and the Plaintiff on the other ‒ were on a willing-seller-and-willing-buyer basis (as the Plaintiff contends), or whether the Plaintiff _must_ supply all goods in fulfilment of all contracts entered into between the Defendant and its customers (as the Defendant contends); and second, whether time is of the essence under the contract, and consequently whether damages were payable if the Plaintiff could not fulfil the orders within a reasonable time: see \[23(a)\] above. In this regard, I noted that Plaintiff had in its affidavit confirmed that it had difficulties fulfilling certain deliveries due to Covid as it sourced its supplies from Malaysia.

41     I also had cognizance of the affidavit of one Henry Young Hao Tai (“Mr **Young**”), whom Defendant had, after the hearing before the DR but prior to the RA, appointed as an expert to value the losses suffered by the Defendant in respect of the 100 _unfulfilled_ orders. Mr Young quantified the losses suffered by the Defendant in dealing with the “100 affected customers” impacted by the “delivery failures” and quantified losses as follows:- loss of direct profits at $70,000, loss of future profits at $13,652 and loss of good will at $283,796.

42     The Plaintiff, on its part, adduced the affidavit of its expert, one Gerald Tan to challenge the Mr Young’s valuations. I shall say no more of the experts’ reports as Order 14 proceedings are not, in my opinion, the right forum to determine if the Plaintiff or the Defendant’s expert opinion is to be preferred, based on affidavit evidence alone.

43     Suffice it to note that in _Kim Seng Orchid’s_ case, a plausible counterclaim seems to connote a rather low threshold, _i.e._ one which is “reasonably possible to succeed at trial” (at \[98(a)\]). I am therefore prepared to accept for present purposes that the Defendant has a plausible counterclaim.

#### Step 2: Whether the plausible counterclaim amounted to a defence of set-off.

44     The existence of a plausible counterclaim simply meant the Defendant could pursue its counterclaim independently. It would not, without more, assist the Defendant in resisting the Plaintiff’s summary judgment application _unless_ it translated into a reasonable, bona fide defence against the Plaintiff’s claim.

#### Legal set off?

45     In this regard, I agree with the DR that legal setoff did not apply as a defence here as the alleged losses suffered by the Defendant in respect of the _unfulfilled_ orders have not been definitively quantified or finally adjudicated as being due at this time, even with Mr Young’s expert evidence. This is not a situation where a set off of mutual debts has arisen to give rise to prospects of a legal set-off.

#### Equitable set off?

46     I also agree with the DR that equitable set off did not apply in the present case. As noted in _Hanak v Green_ <span class="citation">\[1958\] 2 QB 9</span>, the right to equitable set off arises in cases where there is a close relationship or connection between the dealings and transactions which gives rise to the respective clams. As Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) noted in _Abdul Salam Asanaru Pillai v Nomanbhoy & Sons Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 856</span> when discussing the concept of equitable set-off, “in determining how close the connection needs to be, the court should not get bogged down in the nuances of differently expressed formulations, save that there must be a _close and inseparable relationship_ between the claims. Beyond this, the outcome can be left to be governed by notions of fairness and _whether the circumstances are such that it would be manifestly unjust to allow one claim to be enforced without regard to the other_”. _(emphasis added)_

47     As the DR rightly noted, the undisputed claim of $149,173.88 arose from the 183 _fulfilled_ orders which had been delivered, received and paid for by the end customers without issues. There was no evidence on record that these fulfilled orders were the subject matter of complaints or claims for compensations by the end customers. The losses claimed by the Defendant by way of _counterclaim_, on the other hand, related to the 100 _unfulfilled_ orders or future businesses (see Julia Tong’s Second Affidavit at \[14(a)\]), which formed a distinct set of contracts from the _fulfilled_ orders. The end customers, as well as the precise Goods ordered under the _fulfilled_ versus the _unfulfilled_ contracts, were different. Given the separate and distinct nature of the _fulfilled_ and _unfulfilled_ contracts, a right of equitable set off therefore did not arise in this instance. The _fulfilled_ and _unfulfilled_ contracts could not be said to have a “close and inseparable relationship”.

48     Indeed, in O14 applications, where parts of a larger claim are not contested, summary judgement is normally entered for the uncontested portions, with only the contested portion proceeding to trial, so to avoid unnecessary costs and expenses in proving what is in fact not disputed. Unconditional leave to defend the Claimed Amount should not, in my view, be granted on the basis of any alleged right of set off in the present case.

#### Step 3: Whether the plausible counterclaim is sufficiently connected to the claim.

49     As noted above, there is no evidence that the alleged complaints and/or claims affected the _fulfilled_ contracts which formed the subject matter of the Plaintiff’s _claim_. Instead, it was the _unfulfilled_ contracts which accounted for the losses claimed under the _counterclaim_. So construed, the _counterclaim_ arises “out of … quite separate and distinct \[transactions\] or are wholly foreign to the _claim_”. There are in fact “no connections between the claim and counterclaim”. Under Step 3 of _Kim Seng Orchid’s_ case, the High Court held that the court would normally in this instance grant summary judgement without a stay pending the determination of the unconnected counterclaim (see \[98(c)\]).

#### Stage 4. Discretion to stay

50     Even if I were wrong on the is point – _i.e._ there were some connection between the claim and counterclaim - the court will at stage 4 still need to determine whether a stay of the claim pending the determination of the counterclaim should be ordered.

51     This is ultimately a matter for the court’s discretion to be exercised based on established principles. The degree of connection between the claim and counterclaim, the strength and quantum of the counterclaim, and the ability of the plaintiff to satisfy any judgement on the counterclaim are some of the consideration the court will take into account in exercising its discretion whether or not to grant a stay: see _Kim Seng Orchid’s_ case at \[98(d)\]. The exercise of discretion will ultimately depend on whether the Defendant is able to show that it would be fair and just to stay the immediate enforcement of the judgment on the claim due to the pending trial of the counterclaim. The burden is on the Defendant to prove that the stay is justified having regard to all the circumstances of the case: see _Kim Seng Orchid’s_ case at \[98(e)\].

52     In my mind, even if the connectivity requirement for the purposes of Stage 4 were satisfied, it would not be fair and just to grant a stay.

53     I did not find the Defendant’s counterclaim to be particularly strong to begin with. As noted above, based on a comparison of the Original Defence and Counterclaim and the Amended Defence and Counterclaim, it was evident that the Defendant’s Counterclaim had evolved significantly over time. For example, in its Original Counterclaim, the Defendant had only claimed damages for “loss of sales” amounting to $89,542.00. In the Amended Defence and Counterclaim filed after the learned DR’s decision and before the main RA hearing, the Defendant’s counterclaim had however expanded to include loss of future profits and loss of the Novena Brand Value. The amount of the counterclaim, as valued/quantified by Mr Young, had by then ballooned to at least $367,452[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12).

54     Further in paragraph 4 of the Amended Defence and Counterclaim, the Defendant pleaded that “the Defendant had terminated the \[Agreement\] _with the consensus of the Plaintiff_ on 21 July 2021 due to the Plaintiff’s failure to fulfil the deliveries in accordance to the Agreement….”. If so, it was difficult to see how the loss of sales, incurrence of additional expenses in procuring substitutes, etc for the unfulfilled orders could be attributed to the Plaintiff if the termination was consensual by nature, with there being no express mention of any reservation of rights on the Defendant’s part at the time the parties mutually agreed to terminate the Agreement. Further, in relation to the loss of sales due to cancelled orders, the majority (if not all) appeared to be due to the Defendant’s own act in terminating the contracts post 21 July 2021. The date of 21 July 2021 was coincidentally the date the installment payments proposed by Mr Sng was to commence, subject to Mr Sng’s requirement that the 1st LOD must be withdrawn by the said date. The fact that the Plaintiff did not withdraw the 1st LOD gave rise to the distinct possibility that the installment payments as well as the Agreement was thereafter terminated by the Defendant unilaterally on 21 July 2021 due to Plaintiff’s unwillingness to accede to this further requirement.

55     To substantiate its counterclaim, the Defendant also made numerous bare assertions that the customers were unhappy with, and had complained about, the _unfulfilled_ contracts. However, I agreed with Plaintiff’s Counsel that there was no objective evidence placed before this court that such complaints or cancellation of orders preceded the termination of the Plaintiff and Defendant’s contract on 21 July 2021. That such complaints were made by the customers were based on no more than the Defendant’s bare assertions.

56     The claim for losses due to the damage to the Defendant’s brand name was also problematic. Mr Young’s report valued the loss in brand valuation based on 3 trademarks which were registered under Novena Furnishing Centre Pte Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of TT International). If so, the claim for loss of brand value _by the Defendant_ was misguided, as the Defendant was not the owner of the relevant trademarks. In any event, the financial statements of the TT International group appeared to show the consumer electronic and furniture brand value of the group to have been completely written off as of 31 March 2022[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13).

57     Putting aside the strength of the Defendant’s counterclaim, I also agreed with Plaintiff’s Counsel that the Plaintiff’s claim was in respect of the _fulfilled_ contracts which the Defendant had received full payment from the end customers without issues prior to April 2021, which the Defendant has retained for more than a year by now. There was no evidence on record of any complaints or claims for damages from the customers arising in connection with the _fulfilled_ contracts, nor was this the Defendant’s pleaded case. It is thus wholly inequitable for the Defendant to continue retaining these sums pending the resolution of the counterclaim which involved a completely distinct set of contracts (_i.e._ the _unfulfilled_ contracts).

58     Separately, there were no concerns of the Plaintiff being unable to pay on any adverse judgement on the counterclaim should the Defendant prevail at trial. Indeed, the larger risk was that the Defendant would not be able to pay on the Claimed Amounts should a stay be granted and the monies withheld from the Plaintiff for a further period of time, given the current financial situation of the TT International group.

59     As noted in _Kim Seng Orchid’s_ case (at \[98(d)\], whether or not to grant a stay of execution of the whole or a part of the judgment pending trial of a plausible counterclaim is ultimately a matter for the court’s _discretion._ All things considered, it would not, in my opinion, be fair or just for a stay be granted in the present case.

## Conclusion

60     Having regard to all the above, I therefore affirmed the DR’s decision to grant summary judgement on the terms prayed for, and to decline to grant a stay pending the resolution of the counterclaim.

61     The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $10,000 with reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed.
