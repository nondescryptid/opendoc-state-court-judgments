Criminal Law – Offences – Penal Code – Theft

Criminal Procedure – Sentencing – Preventive detention

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9135/2022/01.\]

10 August 2022

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Mr Png Gek Kwee is 55 years old. He has a long history of offending dating back to 1988. In 1991 he was convicted of robbery and sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment. He subsequently committed theft offences, for which he was convicted in 1999, 2000 and 2002. He was sentenced to 5 years’ corrective training in 2002. After his release, he continued to commit a spate of theft and other property-related offences, and was convicted in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and most recently in 2019. He did not stop offending, but committed further offences in 2020 and 2021. Ten charges were brought against him for these most recent offences.

2       On 2 December 2021, he pleaded guilty to five charges, and five other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Given his long history of offending and his continuing risk of offending, pre-sentence reports for corrective training (“**CT**”) and preventive detention (“**PD**”) were called. He was assessed to be at high risk of reoffending and was found suitable to undergo CT and PD.

3       On 30 June 2022, he was sentenced to undergo 7 years’ PD. He was allowed to defer the start of his sentence until 2 August 2022. Meanwhile, on 13 July 2022, he filed the present appeal against the sentence. He was represented by counsel appointed under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) at the plead-guilty proceedings, but is presently unrepresented. He is on bail pending the appeal.

4       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Facts

7       These were the salient facts.

#### Theft on 14 August 2020 (MAC-906565-2020)

8       On 14 August 2020 at about 4.15 am, the defendant was along the common corridor outside Block 697B Jurong West Central 3 #XXX, Jurong West Blossom, Singapore. He saw a Cinelii bicycle secured to the railings outside the unit. He formed the dishonest intention to take the bicycle. He had a hammer with him, which he used to remove a lock securing the frame to the rear wheel, and a lock that was securing the frame to the railings. Then he carried the bicycle down the staircase, and covered his face with an umbrella as he did so. He brought the bicycle home. At about 7.30 am, the person who had been in possession of the bicycle discovered it was missing, and lodged a police report at about 8.42 am.

9       The Cinelii bicycle, which was valued at about $2,500, was recovered by the police.

#### Theft on 15 August 2020 (DAC-917202-2020)

10     On 15 August 2020, at about 5 pm, the defendant was at a shop, Guan Ann Chan Ginseng Supplier located at Block 504 #01-239 Jurong West Street 51, Hong Kah Point, Singapore. He saw packets of sea cucumbers in the shop, and formed the dishonest intention to take a packet. At about 5.04 pm, he opened a container which contained packets of sea cucumber and dishonestly removed one packet of sea cucumber without the knowledge or consent of the owner of the shop. The defendant did so while shielding his hands with an umbrella. He then left the shop without paying for the items. At about 5.58 pm, the shop-owner made a 999 call to report the theft.

11     The packet of sea cucumber which the defendant took was valued at $590. He returned to the shop on 18 August 2020 with his sister and made full restitution of $590.

#### Theft on 16 August 2020 (MAC-906791-2020)

12     On 16 August 2020, at about 3.36 am, the defendant was outside Block 259 Boon Lay Drive #XXX, Boon Lay Crest, Singapore. He saw a Polygon bicycle secured to a shoe rack outside the unit. He formed the dishonest intention to take the bicycle. He removed the lock by pulling on it. He then brought the bicycle home. At about 4.39 am, a resident at the unit made a 999-call reporting that the bicycle was missing.

13     The Polygon bicycle, valued at $600, was recovered by the police.

#### Theft on 9 September 2020 (DAC-919023-2020)

14     On 9 September 2020, at about 11.25 pm, the defendant went to the FairPrice Xtra supermarket located at Jurong Point, 1 Jurong West Central 2, Singapore. He saw a VIVO V19 mobile phone on the display stand in the supermarket and formed the dishonest intention to steal it. At about 11.30 pm, he removed the mobile phone with the security wire attached to it from the display stand. He hid the mobile phone and the security wire in his bag and left the supermarket without paying for the mobile phone. On 10 September 2020 at about 2.51 pm, a security officer of the supermarket lodged a police report about the theft.

15     The mobile phone was valued at $599. The defendant sold it for $100. The mobile phone and security wire were not recovered, and no restitution was made.

#### Theft on 10 July 2021 (DAC-919504-2021)

16     On 10 July 2021, at about 11.00 am, the defendant went to the FairPrice Xtra supermarket located at Ang Mo Kio Hub, 53 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 #B2-40. Between 11.00 am and 11.28 am, he saw and formed the dishonest intention to steal various items. He removed the items and placed them into a bag which he brought along. He left the supermarket at 11.28 am without paying for the items. The stolen items were as set out in the charge (above, at \[5\]). On 11 July 2021, at about 5.38 am, a security officer of the supermarket lodged a police report about the theft.

17     The items had a collective value of $438.85. They were not recovered, and no restitution was made.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

20     The prosecution sought a sentence of PD of at least 7 years.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) It was submitted that given the defendant’s previous convictions, personal circumstances and antisocial attitudes, it would be expedient for the protection of the public that he be detained in custody for a substantial period of time. It was highlighted that the defendant had a long list of antecedents. He had undergone a variety of punishments, ranging from fines, traditional terms of imprisonment, caning and even corrective training. Yet he continued to re-offend. Even a 5-year term of corrective training imposed in 2002 did not deter him. The sentences previously imposed failed to have any reformative effect on him. He was a recalcitrant offender beyond reformation.

### Mitigation plea

21     Counsel for the defendant submitted that it was not necessary to impose PD (or CT) and suggested a term of imprisonment of not more than 19 months.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) The offences were minor property offences and involved no violence, and a sentence of PD would not be proportional.

22     Counsel urged the court to take a sympathetic view of the defendant’s circumstances. The defendant was one of eleven children. He had been the primary caregiver for his mother who was dangerously ill. (She had since died on 29 April 2022, aged 93.) He also lived with an elder brother (aged 65) who was severely autistic and required constant care. The defendant was not close to his siblings, save for his elder sister who was his bailor, and he had hardly any family support. He was on regular follow up at the Institute of Mental Health. Counsel urged the court to give the defendant one last chance and to sentence him to a term of imprisonment instead of PD.

### Sentencing considerations

#### Dominant sentencing considerations

23     In my judgement, the dominant sentencing considerations were specific deterrence and prevention.

24     The defendant had a long history of offending dating back to 1988 (summarised at \[19\], above). As early as 1991, he committed robbery and theft, and received a total sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane. He was evidently not deterred, and went on to commit further theft offences. He was convicted in 1999, 2000 and 2002. In 2002, he was sentenced to 5 years’ CT. Yet a sentence of CT failed to deter or reform him. After his release, he continued to commit a spate of theft and other property-related offences, and was convicted in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and most recently in 2019. The escalation of his sentence from 3 months’ imprisonment (in 2010) to 15 months’ imprisonment (in 2014 and 2019) failed to deter him.

25     His re-offending continued, unabated. Between 10 and 19 August 2020, he committed seven other theft and property-related offences.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) He was charged in court on 21 August 2020. Less than three weeks later, while court proceedings were pending, he committed another theft on 9 September 2020.[^4] Then he committed theft again on 10 and 24 July 2021.[^5]

26     Considering the defendant’s long history of offending, and his repeated reoffending, there was a clear need to deter him and to prevent him from committing further crime in order to protect the public.

#### Pre-sentencing report

27     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that CT and PD were appropriate sentencing options, given the need for specific deterrence and prevention. Pre-sentencing reports were called, in accordance with s 304(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“**CPC**”), to assess the physical and mental condition of the defendant and his suitability for a sentence of CT or PD. (These grounds of decision focus specifically on the sentence of PD, since it was the sentence that was imposed eventually, and the subject matter of this appeal.)

28     The requirements for a sentence of PD are set out in s 304(2) of the CPC:

> (2) Where a person 30 years of age or above —

>> (a)    is convicted before the General Division of the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted in Singapore or elsewhere at least 3 times since he or she reached 16 years of age for offences punishable with such a sentence, and was on at least 2 of those occasions sentenced to imprisonment or corrective training; or

>> (b)    is convicted at one trial before the General Division of the High Court or a District Court of 3 or more distinct offences punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more, and has been convicted and sentenced in Singapore or elsewhere to imprisonment for at least one month since he or she reached 16 years of age for an offence punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more,

> then, if the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public that the person should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time, followed by a period of supervision if released before the expiry of his or her sentence, the court, unless it has special reasons for not doing so, must sentence him or her to preventive detention for a period of 7 to 20 years in lieu of any sentence of imprisonment, or any sentence of imprisonment and fine.

29     It was not in dispute that the technical requirements for the imposition of PD had been met. The defendant pleaded guilty to five charges, each of which was punishable with imprisonment for 2 years or more (above, at \[5\]-\[6\]). He had been convicted at least three times for offences punishable with such a sentence and was on at least two occasions sentenced to imprisonment (for at least one month) or corrective training (above, at \[19\]). Accordingly, the technical requirements for PD under either s 304(2)(a) or s 304(2)(b) of the CPC had been met.

30     For completeness, one other technical point was also considered. Section 304(2) of the CPC empowers the General Division of the High Court or a District Court to impose PD, but such power is not conferred on a Magistrate’s Court. Two of the proceeded charges were Magistrate Arrest Cases (MAC-906565-2020 and MAC-906791-2020) ordinarily triable before a Magistrate’s Court. It was not in dispute, however, that the present court, sitting as a District Court to hear MAC and DAC charges together, could impose a sentence of PD. As was highlighted by the prosecution, this had been done in past cases, including: _PP v PI_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 114</span>, which was affirmed on appeal in MA 43/2006; and, more recently, _Jason Kuppusamy Pannisilvam v PP_ (MA 9013/2014). [^6]

#### Appropriate sentence

31     The defendant was found suitable for PD (as well as CT).[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) In the Pre-Sentencing Report (at pp 6-7), it was stated that the defendant’s family did not appear to be a source of support. He did not have stable employment. His peers did not appear to play an important role in his life. He presented with “behavioural indicators for generalised trouble”. It was assessed that he had a high risk of criminal re-offending, with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release. He did not present with any protective factor.

32     Given the observations in the Pre-Sentencing Report, I accepted the submission of the prosecution that PD was an appropriate sentence for the defendant. I noted his long history of offending. Even a sentence of CT in 2002 had not deterred or reformed him. There was a lack of protective factors, and his assessed risk of recidivism was very high. He committed the present offences in 2020 and 2021 not long after his release from prison in February 2020. I was satisfied that it was expedient for the protection of the public that the defendant should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time by a sentence of PD.

33     As was explained by the Court of Appeal in _PP v Rosli bin Yassin_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 831</span> (at \[11\]), the overarching principle for PD is the need to protect the public:

> \[…\] Put simply, if the individual offender is such a habitual offender whose situation does not admit of the possibility of his or her reform, thus constituting a menace to the public (and this would include, but is not limited to, offences involving violence), a sentence of preventive detention would be imposed on him or her for a substantial period of time in order to protect the public. \[…\]

34     Counsel for the defendant argued that PD would not be a proportional sentence. It must be borne in mind, however, that considerations of proportionality do not apply _rigorously_ in the context of PD (although the principle of proportionality is not to be wholly disregarded). In _Sim Yeow Kee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span>, the High Court explained (at \[97\]):

> In the context of PD, general deterrence and the social value in keeping a hardened criminal out of circulation provide a legitimate basis and operative justification for the application of this regime. Thus, we consider that considerations of proportionality would not apply rigorously in such circumstances. Here too, these considerations would have limited scope for displacing the imposition of a term of PD where such a sentence would otherwise be warranted. However, we reject the notion that it has no application whatsoever. We note that in _Tan Ngin Hai v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 152</span>, the offender was sentenced to eight years’ PD for stealing coins amounting to $1.10 from a van. The court considered it appropriate to do so because it was satisfied that it was “dealing with” an offender who was “deeply” entrenched in the criminal way of life, as could be seen from his past convictions. With great respect, we find ourselves unable to endorse the view that the principle of proportionality is so wholly to be disregarded that incarceration for such duration can fairly be justified for the theft of a few coins.

35     The defendant had committed ten separate theft and property-related offences over the course of about a year. Given his antecedents, he would likely have faced a lengthy custodial sentence in any event. A sentence of PD at the minimum period of 7 years could not be said to be wholly disproportionate to his offending conduct. As explained above, a sentence of PD was justified by the need to protect the public.

### Sentence imposed

36     Accordingly, the defendant was sentenced to PD for 7 years. The sentence was backdated to take effect from 21 August 2020 (the date on which he was remanded for police investigations) and to take into account the periods during which he was in remand and to exclude the periods during which he was on bail.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) The execution of the sentence has been stayed pending the appeal. He is on bail pending the appeal.
