12 November 2019

### District Judge John Ng:

The Accused, Meor Ahmad Bin Meor Idris (male / 58 years old), was convicted of two charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185 (“MDA”) after a trial. One charge in _DAC 923977/2018_ was for consuming **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**, a specified drug, under Section 8(b)(ii) punishable under Section 33A(2) of the MDA. Another charge in _DAC 933555/2018_ was for the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, on or about 16 June 2018 at about 6.45pm, by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking seven packets containing not less than 106.9g of vegetable matter in which **5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group** was detected, under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the MDA.

2       He is now appealing only against his conviction on these two charges. After he was found guilty and convicted of the two charges, he pleaded guilty to two more MDA charges and consented to have seven other charges taken into consideration for sentence. These nine charges are not relevant to this appeal.

## The Prosecution’s case

3       The Prosecution led evidence from 5 Police Officers, 10 Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) Officers, one Malay language translator and 3 Analysts from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The Prosecution also called a rebuttal witness who was with the Accused at the time of his arrest by the police officers. This witness (“Julian”) was initially produced in court by the Police upon the request of the Accused. After the Accused had testified, he changed his mind and decided not to call Julian to testify for the Defence, the Prosecution decided to call him (as a rebuttal witness) to refute allegations made by the Accused against Julian.

#### The Arrest on 16 June 2018

4       On 16 June 2018, at about 6.45pm, the Accused and Julian were arrested on suspicion of consumption of a specified drug by the Police in the vicinity of Block 31 Balam Road, Balam Gardens, Singapore. The Police recovered from the Accused one ziplock bag and seven packets believed to contain controlled drugs. The two persons and the seized items were brought to Bedok Police Division HQ.

#### The procurement of the Urine Specimens

5       After being brought back to the Bedok Police Division HQ, the Accused requested to see a doctor and arrangements were made for him to be brought to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) for a medical examination. PW9 SSSgt Ridzwan was assigned to escort the Accused to CGH. At CGH, while waiting to see the doctor, the Accused wanted to urinate. PW9 brought him to the toilet and procured the urine samples of the Accused. The Accused chose one bottle from 10 empty bottles with red caps. This is commonly referred to as the “master bottle”. He also chose 2 bottles from 20 empty bottles with blue caps. These empty bottles were contained in an escort bag, which the officers had brought with them to the hospital.

6       The Accused opened the red-capped master bottle and urinated into it while watched by SSSgt Ridzwan. The Accused was instructed to pour some of the urine from the master bottle into the 2 blue-capped bottles with some remaining in the red-capped bottle. SSSgt Ridzwan placed the master bottle into one polymer bag and placed the other 2 bottles into another polymer bag. These two sealed polymer bags were given to the Accused and he held onto to them at all times.

7       After the Accused was examined by a doctor and discharged from CGH, he was brought back to Bedok Police HQ. At the police HQ, Sgt Syarifah Jamizah escorted the Accused to the CNB office for the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”). The IUT was conducted on the urine specimen from the red-capped bottle and the result was positive for cannabis. The two blue-capped bottles of urine samples were then labelled and sealed in the Accused’s presence. The Accused deposited the 2 blue-capped bottles into a secured metal box. They were subsequently sent to the HSA for analysis.

#### Analysis of the urine samples of the Accused

8       On 21 and 29 June 2018, the HSA issued two certificates by two Analysts, namely Maggie Tiong Su Su and Chan Si Jia, stating that each of the said urine samples contained 11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, a cannabinol derivative, which is a specified drug.

#### Analysis of the drugs seized from the Accused

9       On 16 July 2018, the HSA issued two certificates by Analyst Lee Yan Kai, stating that the seized exhibits contained a total of not less than 106.9g of vegetable matter in which the controlled drug **5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA or its fluoro positional isomer in the pentyl group** was detected.

#### The statements of the Accused

10     The Accused confessed in his statements (Exhibits P15 and P23) to CNB that he was in possession of the drugs with the intention to sell them. The Accused also confessed to the consumption of cannabis in his statements (Exhibits P15 and P22) to the CNB officers.

#### The phone messages of drug trafficking transactions

11     The phone messages extracted from the handphone of the Accused were unmistakably related to drug transactions as could be seen from the texts and context of the exchanges between the Accused, buyers and potential buyers.

## Defence

12     The Accused denied that the drugs found in his possession on the day of the arrest were meant for trafficking. He claimed that he had intended to consume the drugs with Julian and were not meant for sale. As for the telephone messages, he asserted that they were normal “chit-chat” and not referring to drug trafficking transactions.

13     The Accused testified that his urine samples tested positive for **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid** because he had consumed “mushroom”. He denied that he had consumed cannabis prior to his arrest. “Mushroom” was some synthetic drugs that made him “high” but to him they were not controlled drugs.

14     The Accused alleged that the CNB officers had fabricated the confessions and incriminating portions of his statements P15, P22 and P23.

## The Decision

#### The Consumption Charge

15     This is a case where the two HSA certificates under section 16 of the MDA indicated that **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**, a specified drug, was found in the urine samples of the Accused, which he provided on 16 June 2018. His urine samples had been procured in accordance with the procedures laid out in the Regulations and the analysis of the urine samples were carried out in compliance with Section 31(4) (b) of the MDA. By virtue of the two HSA certificates, the presumption under section 22 of the MDA operated to prove, unless rebutted, that the Accused had consumed the said drug knowingly.

16     The Analysts from the HSA confirmed that the presence of **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**, in the urine specimens of the Accused was consistent with the consumption of **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**. The Accused is presumed to have consumed the specified drug **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**, knowingly. I applied the case of _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> where the Court of Appeal held that both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ of section 8(b) of the MDA were presumed by section 22 of the MDA. The burden is on the Accused to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.

17     The issue is whether the Accused had rebutted this presumption. The Accused had merely denied consuming cannabis despite testing positive for **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**, a specified drug. He had no explanation as to why his urine tested positive for **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid**. In fact, he had admitted to consuming cannabis in his statement P15.

18     I find that the accused has failed to rebut the presumption that he had consumed the specified drug **11-Nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid.** He was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations thereunder to consume the said specified drug.

#### The Trafficking Charge

19     The evidence against the Accused was overwhelming. He was found with the prohibited drugs. He confessed to the trafficking offence when he admitted that he had the drugs for sale. There were the phone messages about drug trafficking transactions (see Paragraph 14 of the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions). Therefore, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused and I found him guilty and convicted him on the two charges.

#### Reliability of the Statements and the corroborative phone messages

20     I found the testimonies of the recording officers of the statements to be clear and their descriptions of the recording process to be credible. They had described the steps they had taken to ensure that the Accused understood both the process and the questions asked. They were unshaken in their answers when cross-examined by the Accused.

21     I found the Accused’s allegations against the recorders to be without merit and aspersions were cast by the Accused against them without basis. I agree with the DPP’s submissions that the Accused vacillated between claiming he was under the influence of drugs and suffering withdrawal symptoms to claiming that the officers had fabricated or distorted the statements. These inconsistent claims were obvious afterthoughts to disavow the incriminating portions of the statements he had given.

22     The admissions of trafficking were also backed up by the incriminating phone messages extracted from his handphone. These messages touched on general matters such as the amount of drugs and the price of drugs and the quality of drugs supplied by the Accused. These provided corroborative evidence of the reliability of his confessions. It was ludicrous for the Accused to suggest that the messages were normal “chit-chat” and were misinterpreted by the translator and misunderstood by the investigators.

## Conclusion

23     The evidence against the Accused is clear beyond any doubt. I found no need to go into more details touching upon the guilt of the Accused. I had found the Closing Submissions of the DPP to be very comprehensive and would agree with them without repeating them here. The various other points mentioned by the DPP in her submissions, together with the key points mentioned above, had more than established the guilt of the Accused.

24     Even though the Accused persisted in challenging the Prosecution’s evidence without any basis, I did not count his lack of remorse against him when I passed sentence. The Accused is currently serving his sentence of a total imprisonment term of 12 years and 3 months backdated to take effect from 20 July 2018. The Accused was not liable for caning due to his age but I decided that there was no need to impose imprisonment in lieu of caning.
