\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9768/2020/01-02.\]

4 November 2020

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was the precedent partner of two partnerships, Furniture Collection Centre (FCC) and Yang Hua Furniture Trading (YHFT). The Accused wilfully with intent to evade tax made a false entry to her income tax return for the Year of Assessment 2016. The Accused also failed to notify the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax of FCC’s liability to be registered for Goods and Services Tax (GST) by 31 July 2010.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to one charge for an offence under s96(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) and one charge for an offence under s 61(a) read with s 74(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GSTA). I sentenced the Accused to a global sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $4,000 in default two day’s imprisonment and the statutorily mandated penalties. The primary issue in this case was whether the Court should adopt a new sentencing framework set out by the Prosecution for tax evasion offences under the ITA.

3       The Accused and the Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence have appealed. The Accused has paid the fine, is paying the penalties by way of an instalment plan and is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Charges

4       The details of the three charges are as follows:

> **MSC 901893 of 2019**

> You, Lin Shaohau, are charged that you, on or about 16th April 2016, in Singapore, being the precedent partner of Furniture Collection Centre (“FCC”) and Yang Hua Furniture Trading (“YHFT”), did wilfully with intent to evade tax, make a false entry in your income tax return (Form B) for the Year of Assessment 2016 made under the Income Tax Act (Cap 134, 2014 Rev. Ed) (“ITA”), _to wit_, by reporting your ‘Total Partnership Income’ as $59,483.00, the said entry being false because of the underreporting of your share of the partnership profits derived from FCC and YHFT and when in fact the correct entry should have been S$504,353.00, which resulted in a tax undercharged amounting to $79,142.13, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 96(1)(b) of the ITA and punishable under section 96(1) of the ITA.

> **MSC 901894 of 2019**

> You, Lin Shaohua, are charged that you, on or about 31st July 2010, in Singapore, being the precedent partner of Furniture Collection Centre (“FCC”), did fail to comply with paragraph 4(1) of the First Schedule to the Goods and Services Tax Act (Cap 117A, 2005 Rev Ed.) (“GSTA”), _to wit_, by failing to notify the Comptroller of Goods and Services Tax of FCC’s liability to be registered under paragraph 1(1)(a)(i) of the First Schedule within 30 days after the end of the quarter ending on 30th June 2010, i.e. by 30th July 2010, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 61(a) read with section 74(1) of the GSTA, and punishable under section 61(i), (ii) and (iii) of the GSTA.

## Facts

5       The Accused is Lin Shaohua, a 50-year-old female Singaporean Permanent Resident. As the precedent partner of FCC and YHFT the Accused operated the businesses. Ms Lim Sai Cheok, Lucy (Lucy) worked as a freelance accountant for the Accused. From 2009 to 2015, Lucy prepared the accounts and filed the income tax returns for FCC and YHFT (Form Ps). She also filed the Accused’s personal income tax returns (Form Bs).

6       Lucy would tabulate and inform the Accused of FCC’s and YHFT’s actual sales, and, whenever the actual sales figures exceeded the $1 million threshold for GST registration, the Accused would instruct Lucy to reduce the reported sales to below the threshold. This was done since Year of Assessment (YA) 2011 for FCC and since YA2013 for YHFT. The Accused gave Lucy the discretion to adjust the figures in the income statements that accompanied the businesses’ Form Ps. This led to an underreporting of the ‘Adjusted Profit’ figures of FCC and YHFT and the ‘Share of Divisible Profit/Loss’ figures declared for each partner of the respective entities in the Form Ps.

7       Lucy would show the Accused the final draft income statement, having made the necessary adjustment, for submission to IRAS with the entities Form Ps. The Accused approved them by signing on the income statements and Lucy filed the Form Ps for the Accused using her SingPass login details.

8       As a result of this scheme, YCC and YHFT did not pay the GST that they were liable for up till the period ending 31 December 2016. The Accused’s personal income tax liability was also reduced. The Accused admitted that she had instructed Lucy to reduce the sales figures for FCC and YHFT in order to evade taxes and avoid GST registration as she felt that registration would adversely affect the profitability and competitiveness of her businesses.

9       For YA2016, the Accused instructed Lucy to reduce FCC’s and YHFT’s reported sales figure below the $1 million threshold. This led to the Accused underreporting her partnership income. The Accused made a false entry in her Form B by reporting that her “Total Partnership Income” for YA2016 was $59,483.00 when the correct entry should have been $504,353.00. As a result, the Accused underreported her total partnership income by $444,870.00 and this resulted in tax undercharged amounting to $79,142.13.

10     The value of FCC’s taxable supplies for the four quarters ending 30 June 2010 had exceeded $1 million. As such, FCC was liable to be registered from GST and was required to notify the Comptroller of GST about its liability by 30 30 July 2010. By failing to notify the Comptroller of GST by 30 July 2010, FCC had committed an offence under section 61(a) GSTA which was committed with the consent of the Accused, the precedent partner of FCC, and, as such, the Accused had committed an offence under s 61(a) read with s 74 of the GSTA. The total amount of tax due from FCC commencing from the date on which FCC was required to make the notification was $246,489.76.

11     Prior to pleading guilty the Accused had made full restitution of all her outstanding personal income tax and would complete making full restitution of the GST owed to IRAS by May 2020.

## Charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing

12     The Accused admitted to and consented for another charge under s 96(1)(b) of the ITA and a charge under section 61(a) read with section 74(1) of the GSTA being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Issues to be determined

13     Some of the issues to be determined in this case were identical to the issues that I had to consider in another case prosecuted by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), namely _Public Prosecutor v Tan Song Cheng_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 50</span>. The sentencing decision in _Tan Song Cheng_ was delivered on 20 July 2020, approximately two weeks before I delivered the decision in the present case. As such, where appropriate, I have replicated to my findings in _Tan Song Cheng_ in the present case.

14     The issues to be determined in this case are as follows:

> (a)     Did the case of _Chng Gim Huat v Public Prosecutor_ \[2000\] 2 SLR (R) 360 establish a sentencing benchmark?

> (b)     Whether I should adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in determining the appropriate sentences for the ITA offences.

> (c)     Whether the amount of income tax evaded, as a proxy for the harm caused by the offence, had been factored into the mandatory penalty portion of the sentence and, therefore, should not be considered in the calibration of the appropriate sentence of imprisonment and/or fine.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

15     The section 96(1)(b) offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both. In addition, the Court must impose a mandatory penalty of treble the amount of tax which had been undercharged.

16     The section 61(a) read with section 74(1) of the GSTA offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding $10,000. In addition, the Court must impose a penalty equal to 10% of the tax due.

### Antecedents

17     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

18     As indicated at paragraph \[13\] above the present case shared similarities to _Tan Song Cheng._ In _Tan Song Cheng_ the Prosecution had submitted that I should adopt their proposed sentencing framework which was predicated on a harm-culpability approach. The Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions tendered in the present case mirrored the Prosecution’s Sentencing Submission tendered in _Tan Song Cheng_, with the exception of how the proposed sentencing framework was to be applied to the facts of the respective cases. As the Prosecution's justification for the proposed sentencing framework in both cases is identical, I will adopt the summary of their submissions that I wrote in _Tan Song Cheng._

19     The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the section 96(1)(b) of the ITA offence, based on the proposed sentencing framework, and a fine of $4,000 for the s 61(a) of the GSTA offence, with the mandatory financial penalties, would be the appropriate sentences.

20     The Prosecution highlighted that the Prosecution and the State Courts’ had been taking reference from the case of _Chng Gim Huat_ to calibrate the appropriate sentences for section 96(1) of the ITA offences. The Prosecution highlighted that this approach did not utilise the full range of the sentence under section 96(1) as there had been a clustering of sentences at the very low end of the sentencing range, namely sentences ranging from one weeks’ to one and a half months’ imprisonment.

21     The Prosecution submitted that previous sentences that had been imposed in cases pre-dating the present case did not show a correlation between the seriousness of the offences, as reflected by the quantum of income tax evaded or the culpability of the offender. As an example, the Prosecution pointed out that the offender in _PP v Kung Seah Lim[^1]_ who had evaded tax of $23,545.65 and the offender in _PP v Tan Hang Yang[^2]_ who had evaded tax of $434,791.63 had both been sentenced to one months’ imprisonment respectively.

22     The Prosecution also submitted that the clustering of sentences for earlier cases at the one-month benchmark undermined the seriousness of fraud-related offences under the ITA.

23     The Prosecution submitted that I was not bound by the decision in _Chng Gim Huat_ because that case was not intended to be treated as a sentencing benchmark as the case did not have the characteristics of a sentencing benchmark as laid down in _Abu Syed Chowdhury v Public Prosecutor_ \[2002\] 1 SLR (R) 182.

24     Having analysed the various sentencing approaches highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ \[2007\] 2 SLR 449, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing framework that should be utilised for tax evasion offences should be based on the _R v Taueki_ \[2005\] 3 NZLR 372 methodology of using a two-staged approach giving heed to both offence and offender-specific factors.

25     The Prosecution proposed a sentencing framework that was anchored in a harm-culpability analysis. The Prosecution proposed adapting the five-step framework set out in _Logachev Vladislay v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> as follows:

> (a)     Step 1: Identifying the level of harm and culpability of the offender. The Prosecution submitted that the primary determinant of harm in tax evasion offences was the **quantum of tax evaded**. The Prosecution proposed the following table listing out the factors affecting harm and culpability:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.58%"> <col width="49.42%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence-specific factor (non-exhaustive)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><u>Factors going towards harm</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.

Abuse of position and breach of trust – e.g. did the offender breach any position of trust in committing the offence</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Step 2: Identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range. The Prosecution proposed a harm-culpability matrix should be utilised to determine the indicative starting sentence. The Prosecution submitted that the level of harm should be predominantly determined by the amount of tax loss to the State and less so by the other three factors referred to in the table at paragraph \[(a)\] above. The Prosecution proposed the following matrix:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.7150569886023%"> <col width="25.0949810037992%"> <col width="25.0949810037992%"> <col width="25.0949810037992%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 1 Harm (below $75,000 evaded)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 2 Harm (between $75,000 to $150,000 evaded)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level 3 Harm (above $150,000 evaded)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 6 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 18 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High Culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24 to 36 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (c)     Step 3: Identifying the starting point within the indicative sentencing range.

> (d)     Step 4: Adjusting the starting point to consider offender-specific mitigating and aggravating factors. The Prosecution proposed that the Court consider the following non-exhaustive factors:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.02%"> <col width="49.98%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific mitigating factors</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offender-specific aggravating factors</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Pleaded guilty</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Relevant antecedents</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cooperation with the authorities</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">TIC charges</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Offender’s remorse</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lack of remorse</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Personal circumstances of the offender</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Taking active steps to avoid detection / thwart investigations</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (e)     Step 5: Adjustment to the sentence to consider the one transaction rule and the totality principle.

26     Applying the matrix to the current case, the Prosecution submitted that that based on the quantum of tax evaded in the two proceeded charges the harm would be Level 2 harm. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability was in the low culpability range as her modus operandi was not sophisticated and it did not involve attempts to obfuscate or to falsify source documents. The Accused’s scheme was, simply, to artificially reduce FCC’s and YHFT’s sales figures and this led to the Accused underreporting her total partnership income.

27     The Prosecution submitted that based on level 2 harm and low culpability the indicative sentencing range would be a sentence between six months’ to one years’ imprisonment. At step 3 of the framework, the Prosecution submitted that an appropriate starting point would be six months’ imprisonment for the ITA charge.

28     At step 4, the Prosecution submitted that the additional charges under section 96(1) of the ITA was an aggravating factor. In that charge the Accused had made a false entry in her YA2015 income tax return leading to $7,654 in the amount of tax undercharged. The Prosecution submitted that the TIC charge should result in an enhancement of the sentence.

29     With regard to the mitigating factors, the Prosecution submitted that only the fact that the Accused had pleaded guilty should be considered. After balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors, the Prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence would be four months’ imprisonment for the ITA offence. The Prosecution submitted that no further adjustment had to be made at step 5.

30     In the Prosecution’s Reply Submissions, the Prosecution submitted that that precedents for section 96(1) of the ITA did not lend support to Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework precisely because sentences in past cases had not utilised the full sentencing range under section 96(1).

31     In response to the Defence’s submission that the old sentencing approach, i.e. derived from the sentences imposed in the precedent cases, was indicative of past judicial wisdom and it demonstrated that sentences between one weeks’ and one and a half months’ imprisonment were adequate sentences, the Prosecution pointed out that the precedent sentences demonstrated that there was clearly no correlation between the sentences and the harm and/or culpability. The Prosecution submitted that the “weight of precedent” should not militate against the adoption of a sentencing framework.

32     The Prosecution submitted that the Defence submission that a departure from the old sentencing approach would result in prejudice and unfairness to the Accused was without merit. The Prosecution highlighted that the sentencing framework did not revolutionise sentencing outcomes as imprisonment had been the usual sentence since _Chng Gim Huat_. The Prosecution relied on the Court of Appeals holding in _Adri Anton Kalangie v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 557</span> to submit that the Accused could not rely on a legitimate expectation as to the sentence save that the sentence should be within the statutorily prescribed range.

33     For the section 61(1)(a) of the GSTA charge, the Prosecution submitted that a fine of $4,000 would be appropriate based on the sentencing precedents.

### Mitigation

34     The Defence submitted that the Prosecution’s submission for a sentence of four months’ imprisonment was against the weight of precedents which showed that sentences did not exceed six weeks’ imprisonment for tax evasion offences. The Defence submitted that the precedents represented an aggregation of past judicial wisdom that clearly favoured sentences between one weeks’ and six weeks’ imprisonment.

35     The Defence further submitted that to depart from these precedents would cause prejudice and unfairness to the Accused. The Defence relied on _Public Prosecutor v UI_ \[2008\] 4 SLR (R) 500 and submitted that a “high level of consistency in sentencing is desirable as the presence of consistency reflects well on the fairness of the legal system”.

36     The Defence pointed out that in _PP v Lim Bee Hua[^3]_ the offender, who had evaded $73,852.60 in taxes, was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment, in _PP v Teo Joo Hiang[^4]_ the offender, who had evaded $64,308.92 in taxes, was sentenced to one weeks’ imprisonment and in _PP v Foo Tiew Heng[^5]_ the offender, who had evaded $79,142 in taxes, was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment. The Defence stated that in terms of the quantum of taxes evaded these three cases were very similar to the present case and submitted that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the Accused would be disproportionate taking into account the sentences imposed on the offenders in the precedent cases.

37     The Defence also took issue with the Prosecution modelling the proposed framework on the framework in _R v Taueki_ \[2005\] 3 NZLR 372 which was adopted by the Court of Appeal in _Terence Ng_. The Defence pointed out that if the Prosecution had desired to give effect to the full sentencing range under section 96(1) of the ITA it would have made provision in its table at paragraph \[25(b)\] for the imposition of fines. As the table did not make provision for fines, the Defence submitted that this meant that the Prosecution was urging the court to implement a mandatory custodial sentence for tax evasion offences.

38     The Defence submitted that the _Taueki_ methodology was not appropriate because it was a guideline judgment for offences involving serious violence. The adoption of the _Taueki_ methodology in _Terence Ng_ was appropriate as that case was dealing with an offence of rape. The Defence submitted that tax evasion was not as grave an offence as other serious offenses involving violence or rape. The Defence also submitted that the fact that Singapore had budget surpluses and had large fiscal reserves meant that tax evasion was less serious as it was unlikely to pose a serious threat to Singapore’s fiscal or economic health.

39     The Defence submitted that the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework placed excessive weight on the amount of tax in determining the level of harm. The Defence submitted that the amount of tax evaded had already been factored into the sentencing calculus as it was the sole determinant of the mandatory treble penalty.

40     The Defence conceded that the amount of tax evaded was a relevant factor but that it should not be the primary factor in determining the appropriate sentence. The Defence proposed that if the Court adopted a harm-culpability framework as sought by the Prosecution then the amount of tax evaded should not be the predominant consideration in determining the harm caused by the offence. The Defence submitted that the level of sophistication and the difficulty of detection should feature heavily in determining the harm. The Defence also submitted that the level of reputational loss caused to IRAS should be considered as a relevant factor in determining the appropriate level of harm.

41     In their Further Submissions, the Defence took issue with the Prosecution’s calibration of the sentencing matrix at paragraph \[25(b)\] above, in that they argued that the Prosecution’s calibration of Level 1 harm as being reached if the Accused had evaded between $1 and $75,000 in tax was flawed. The Defence submitted that the value of $75,000 today and two decades ago, when _Chng Gim Huat_, was decided was not equivalent. The Defence submitted that with rising income is was likely that there would be an upward trend in the amount of tax evaded.

42     The Defence pointed out that there were strong mitigating factors. The Accused had made full restitution of all the outstanding income tax and was in process of finalising the restitution of the GST owed. The Defence further submitted that as there had been restitution the harm caused by the tax evasion had been remedied. The Accused had been cooperative with IRAS. The Accused had pleaded guilty at an early stage and this demonstrated her remorse.

43     The Defence also submitted that the Accused’s personal circumstances were mitigating. The Accused had tragically lost her first son in a drowning accident in 2008. This tragedy affected her emotional and mental well-being and affected her ability to properly manage FCC and YHFT. The Accused was blessed with a second child in 2013 and was concerned that a sentence of imprisonment would be contrary to her wish to be a good role model for her child. The Accused was also concerned that, as her husband is 72 years old, the care of her child would be compromised.

44     The Defence submitted that a fine was an appropriate sentence, but if the Court, was minded to sentence the Accused to imprisonment then a sentence no longer than one months’ imprisonment should be imposed.

#### Does Chng Gim Huat establish a sentencing benchmark for section 96(1) offences?

47     As I have stated at paragraph \[13\] and \[18\] above this issue was the same as an issue decided in _Tan Song Cheng_ and, as such, I will refer to my findings in that case.

48     In _Abu Syed Chowdhury_ Yong CJ, at \[15\] stated:

> “A “benchmark” is a sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every judge, ensuring consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not cast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial prerogative to tailor criminal sanctions to the individual offender. It instead provides **the focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately determined.** A good “benchmark” decision therefore lays down **carefully the parameters of its reasoning in order to allow future judges to determine what falls within the scope of the “norm”, and what exceptional situations justify a departure from it**”.

**\[Emphasis added\]**

49     Therefore, in order for a decision to create a benchmark sentence it should meet the two criteria emphasised in the excerpt at paragraph \[48\] above, namely, that (1) the benchmark provides a focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases **with differing degrees of culpability** can be determined. I found that the bolded phrase is the key requirement in that sentences should differ depending on the relative culpability of the offender vis-à-vis the benchmark sentence.

50     That (2) the benchmark should **lay down the parameters of its reasoning** so that future judges will be able to determine what falls within the norm of a benchmark and when to depart from it. As I have found below, the decision in _Chng Gim Huat_ does not encapsulate these criteria.

51     The appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ had appealed against his conviction and the sentence imposed for offences of tax evasion under section 96(1) ITA. Yong CJ disagreed with the appellant’s submission that he should be sentenced to a fine rather than a sentence of imprisonment. Yong CJ stated that the public interest was significant in tax evasion cases as the offences “were grave and were tantamount to a deliberate fraud on the State” and that the offences affect society as a whole resulting in the State’s revenue having to be made up by other taxpayers. In addition, he found tax evasion offences were often difficult to detect and as such he held that “a custodial sentence should normally be imposed in order to meet the needs of general deterrence”: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\].

52     The appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ had with wilful intent to evade tax omitted to include a sum of $290,000 from his income tax return for YA1995 and a sum of $1,024.000 from his income tax return for YA1996, resulting in a global tax undercharged of $354,645.65 for the two YAs. Yong CJ allowed the Appellant’s appeal against sentence and reduced the sentences imposed by the Magistrate to one months’ imprisonment for the first charge and two months’ imprisonment for the second charge.

53     I found that apart from stating that a custodial sentence should be the norm for offences under section 96(1) of the ITA, Yong CJ did not, by his decision in _Chng Gim Huat_, establish a sentencing benchmark for such offences. First, Yong CJ did not explicitly state in _Chng Gim Huat_ that the decision should be utilised as a sentencing benchmark.

54     Second, in deciding on the appropriate sentence, he agreed with the District Judge’s findings that the offences had been committed with premeditation and deliberation, that the total tax evaded was substantial and that the appellant was the mastermind: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[110\] and \[111\]. However, Yong CJ did not expressly address how the harm caused by such offences should be calibrated nor did he list out factors that would affect an offender’s degree of culpability or the interplay between the harm caused and the culpability of the offender. Therefore, I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not provide a focal point against which sentences in subsequent cases could take reference from.

55     Third, in _Chng Gim Huat_ the tax evaded was relatively high, for the second proceeded charge the appellant had evaded tax amounting to $276,471.26. The Prosecution tendered a graph of the quantum of tax evaded in individual charges tendered against offenders since _Chng Gim Huat_[^6]_._ The quantum of tax evaded by the appellant in the second charge in _Chng Gim Huat_ is exceeded by only two other charges, namely one where the tax evaded was $387,750.64 and another involving evasion of tax of $434,791.63. Therefore, I found that based on the very high quantum of tax evaded in the second charge, _Chng Gim Huat_ cannot be said to represent the typical case or the “norm” thus the sentence imposed in _Chng Gim Huat_ cannot give rise to a benchmark against which other cases take reference.

56     Whilst I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not establish a benchmark for section 96(1) of the ITA offence, I did find that I could take guidance from the case in determining the appropriate sentence for section 96(1) ITA offences, in particular, as stated at \[53\] above the principle that a custodial sentence should be the starting point for such offences.

57     Yong CJ had also referred to the Hong Kong Court of Appeal decision in _AG v Ma Lai Wu_ \[1987\] HKLR 744 as providing useful guidance on the governing factors to be considered in deciding on the appropriate sentence for tax evasion offences: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[108\]. Silke JA held in _Ma Lai Wu_ at \[747D – 747G\]:

> “… We think that, in Hong Kong, … sentences of immediate custodial imprisonment should in future be imposed in the appropriate cases.

> _It is necessary for a court to take into consideration when assessing the quantum of such sentence – and this list is not intended to be exhaustive –_ **_the time span of the offences, the systems and methods used to evade tax, where or not there was re-payment of the tax evaded, the amount of tax, the individual culpability of one or more defendants and the circumstances of each defendant_**”

\[ **Emphasis added**\]

58     I found that the factors referred to in _Ma Lai Wu_ were clearly factors that should be considered when determining the appropriate sentence for offences under section 96(1). I noted that the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework incorporated these factors (and more) at Steps 1 and 4.

#### Is there a need to re-consider how sentences are calibrated for section 96(1) of the ITA offences?

59     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that there was a need to re-consider how sentences for section 96(1) of the ITA were calibrated.

##### (1)   Departing from the weight of precedents

60     In _UI_, Chan CJ held at \[17\]:

> “Dealing, first, with the issue of the extent to which a lower court is entitled to disregard the guidance given by established sentencing precedents (which commonly set out “guidelines” or “benchmarks’), in our view, it would not be proper for a trial judge to depart from such precedents without, at the very least, giving cogent reasons as to why they should not be applied in the case before him. This approach is based on two basic principles. The first is that a lower court should respect the guidance given by a higher court in similar cases, even though the judge may not personally agree with the views of the higher court. …The colloary of this principle is _consistency in sentencing_, which is achievable only by a lower court adhering, over a period of time, to sentencing guidelines or benchmarks set by a higher court.”

61     By considering, and thereafter applying, the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework I was not disregarding the guidance give in _Chng Gim Huat._ On the contrary, I have found that on the basis of _Chng Gim Huat_ a custodial sentence should be the norm for offences under section 96(1) of the ITA and I have also found that the factors to be considered in calibrating a sentence found at paragraph \[108\], \[110\] and \[111\] of that case are generally relevant to the calibration of sentences in section 96(1) of the cases.

62     However, as stated at \[53\] to \[56\] above, I found that _Chng Gim Huat_ did not establish a sentencing benchmark apart from establishing the principle that a custodial sentence should be the norm for offences of tax evasion under section 96(1) of the ITA. As it was apparent that sentences for section 96(1) of the ITA offences post-_Chng Gim Huat_ had not utilised the full sentencing spectrum I also found that there were cogent reasons for me to depart from the sentencing trend of imposing sentences up to two months’ imprisonment for these offences that had become the norm since _Chng Gim Huat._ To emphasise, the reasons to adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework was to ensure sentences are calibrated taking into account the harm caused by the offence and the offender’s individual culpability and utilise the full sentencing spectrum.

63     I also found that there was no consistency in the sentences imposed for section 96(1) of the ITA offences since _Chng Gim Huat_ except that sentences were always under two months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents detailing 25 cases under section 96(1) that had been sentenced since _Chng Gim Huat_ had been decided[^7]. The Prosecution also tendered a graph showing the sentences imposed for the individual charges in the 25 precedent cases and the corresponding quantum of income tax evaded[^8].

64     I found that it was apparent from the table of precedents and the graph that in terms of the length of imprisonment the high water mark in sentencing for section 96(1) of the ITA offences was the sentence of two months’ imprisonment imposed on the Appellant in _Chng Gim Huat_ for the second charge involving tax undercharged of $276,471.26[^9]. Shorter sentences have been imposed for charges where the amount of tax undercharged was significantly higher than the tax undercharged in the second charge in _Chng Gim Huat._

65     For instance, in _Tan Hang Yang_ the tax undercharged for the first proceeded charge was $434,791.63 and for the second proceeded charge was $387,750.64. The offender was sentenced to one months’ imprisonment per charge, a sentence shorter than the sentence for the second charge in _Chng Gim Huat._ According to Prosecution’s table there were no aggravating factors in _Tan Hang Yong_ compared to _Chng Gim Huat_ where the appellant had acted with premeditation and deliberation and had claimed trial. However, the quantum of tax evaded in _Tan Hang Yang_ was between $100,000 and $150,000 more than in _Chng Gim Huat_ and balancing the aggravating factors in _Chng Gim Huat_ against the quantum of tax evaded in _Tan Hang Yang_ would suggest at least similar sentences.

66     A starker contrast can be seen when _Tan Hang Yang_ is compared with _Kung Seah Lim._ The offender in _Kung Seah Lim_ had pleaded guilty to two charges of tax evasion of $11,587.86 and $23,545.65 respectively and was sentenced to two weeks’ and four weeks’ imprisonment respectively. Whilst there were additional aggravating factors in _Kung Seah Lim_ when compared to _Tan Hang Yang_ it is hard to see how a similar sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate in view of the vast difference in the amount of tax evaded.

67     At the other end of the spectrum, the offender in _PP v Ng Hai Hock[^10]_ was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment respectively for two charges, one involving a tax undercharge of $23,243.26 and the other involving a tax undercharge of $20.021.69. There were aggravating factors in _Ng Hock Hai_, the offender had acted with premeditation and deliberation and there were TIC charges. However, the amount of tax undercharged in _Ng Hai Hock_ for both proceeded charges were far below the tax undercharged in the first charge in _Chng Gim Huat_ and despite this a higher sentence for both charges was imposed on the offender in _Ng Hai Hock._

68     Whilst I agreed with the Defence submission that the Prosecution’s sentencing framework would be out of step with the weight of precedents; it was clear to me that: (1) as there was little or no correlation between the amount of tax evaded and the sentences imposed for charges decided post-_Chng Gim Huat_; and (2) that _Chng Gim Huat_ should not be considered a sentencing benchmark, there was no “high level of consistency” in the sentencing precedents and, consequently, I found that I should not be bound by the precedent cases. I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a need for a more principled approach to sentencing that utilised a sentencing framework.

69     As stated above, the current sentencing norm does not utilise the full sentencing spectrum provided for by Parliament as sentences imposed post-_Chng Gim Huat_ cluster at the very low end of the sentencing range, i.e. between one weeks’ to six weeks’ imprisonment. Taking reference only from the sentences imposed in _Chng Gim Huat_ and the sentences imposed in the precedent cases and treating these as a benchmark would continue to result in sentences remaining at the lower end of the sentencing range for tax evasion offences. In _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\] Yong CJ held that tax evasion offences were “tantamount to a deliberate fraud on the State” and that general deterrence must be the primary sentencing consideration. The clustering of sentences below two months’ imprisonment undermined the seriousness of the section 96(1) of the ITA offence and lessened the deterrent effect of sentences.

##### (2)   Utilising the full sentencing spectrum

70     It was apparent that in the 19 years since _Chng Gim Huat_ was decided, the vast majority of sentences for offences under section 96(1) of the ITA appeared to have taken reference to the sentences imposed in _Chng Gim Huat_ and sentences have clustered at the one week to six weeks’ imprisonment mark. The maximum sentence of imprisonment for an offence under section 96(1) of the ITA is three years’ imprisonment. It was clear that the full range of the sentencing spectrum has not been utilised in s 96(1) ITA offences.

71     In _Ong Chee Eng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span>, Chua JA held at \[24\] as follows:

> “The court must resist an unhesitating application of benchmark sentences without first thoroughly considering if the particular factual circumstances of a case fall within the reasonable parameters of the benchmark case. Ultimately, where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences, it is the duty of the court to ensure that the full spectrum is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence. _Where benchmarks harden into rigid formulae which suggest that only a segment of the possible sentencing range should be applied by the court, there is a risk that the court might inadvertently usurp the legislative function_”

\[ _Emphasis in the original_\]

72     In _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span>, Menon CJ held at \[59\] as follows:

> “… It is trite that the statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity with which Parliament views any individual offence and that the sentencing judge ought to note the maximum penalty imposed and then apply his mind to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament: _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> (“Angliss”) at \[86\]. Put another way, **the court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence**: see _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> at \[24\].”

\[ **Emphasis mine**\]

73     Sentences appear to have slavishly taken reference to the sentences imposed in _Chng Gim Huat_ and resulted in sentences of less than six weeks’ imprisonment being imposed. It was quite clear that the full range of the sentencing spectrum for section 96(1) offences has **not been utilised**. The sentences post-_Chng Gim Huat_ are all below 5% of the statutory maximum penalty. It did not appear to me that there had been sufficient consideration of the differing levels of harm or culpability relevant to offences and offenders decided post-_Chng Gim Huat_.

74     On the basis of this, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that there was a need to implement a sentencing framework that utilised the full sentencing spectrum for offences under section 96(1) of the ITA. Therefore, I found that I was not bound to follow the decision in _Chng Gim Huat_ in the sense that it established a sentencing benchmark of a short custodial sentence of up to two months for section 96(1) ITA offences.

##### (3)   Would a departure from the old sentencing approach result in prejudice and unfairness to the Accused?

75     I found that the adoption of the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework would not result in unfairness or prejudice to the Accused. First, as stated above, _Chng Gim Huat_ did not establish a sentencing benchmark that had to invariably be followed and there has clearly been no consistency in the sentences imposed post-_Chng Gim Huat_ as the sentences do not appear to take into account the level of harm or the culpability of the offenders. There was no sentencing framework post-_Chng Gim Huat_, except that the Prosecution and courts appear to have treated _Chng Gim Huat_ as setting the upper limit for custodial sentences in tax evasion cases.

76     Second, I agreed with the Prosecution that the proposed sentencing framework did not “revolutionise” the sentencing outcomes as a custodial sentence was the expected sentence for section 96(1) offences post-_Chng Gim Huat_: see _Ding Si Yang v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 229</span> at \[103\].

77     Third, the Defence argued that at the time of the commission of the offence the Accused had the legitimate expectation that the sentence for her offences would be limited to the range of sentences that had been imposed post-_Chng Gim Huat._ In _Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 557</span>, Menon CJ held at \[57\]:

> “The other primary justification advanced was “fairness” to the offender. This appears to be grounded in the view that an offender has, at the time of the commission of the offence, some “legitimate expectation” as to the sentencing framework that should be applicable to him, and should thus be “forewarned” of any change in that framework. **It is not apparent why this should be the case**. Indeed, it is **not entirely clear if an individual can even**, **_at the time of commission of the offence_****, said to have a legitimate expectation as to the sentence that he will receive** in the event that he is subsequently successfully prosecuted for the offence, **save that the sentence should be within the relevant statutorily-prescribed range**, Instead, as the High Court noted in _Ding Si Yang_, little weight should be given to the expectation of one who deliberately flouted the law and later found the expected costs or consequences were worse than anticipated … ”

\[ **Emphasis mine**\]

78     I agreed that little weight should be given to the Accused’s expectations that her sentence would be up to a maximum of six weeks’ imprisonment in view of the fact that the prescribed sentencing range was a term of imprisonment up to three years and the fact that she had deliberately flouted the law.

#### Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework

79     I agreed that the appropriate forum to adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework would be an Appellate Court. However, in view of the fact that I found that the present sentencing norm was inadequate for the reasons stated above I found that I could take guidance from and apply the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework in order to calibrate the appropriate sentences for the present offences.

80     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the proposed sentencing framework should be based on a harm-culpability analysis. This approach would allow the court the flexibility to calibrate the sentence taking into account the varied culpability and harm factors that could arise in tax evasion cases. I found that the sentencing framework provided a rational and principled basis for calibrating the appropriate sentence. I further agreed that the five-step sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution was the correct approach.

##### (1)   Step 1

81     At step 1, the court would have to identify the level of harm caused by the offence and the level of culpability involved. The Prosecution provided at non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered to determine the level of harm and culpability, see paragraph \[25(a)\] above.

82     The primary harm caused by an offence of tax evasion is the deprivation of revenue due to the public coffers and the corresponding loss that would arise from the fact that the tax cannot be used for the benefit of society as a whole. This lost revenue would have to be made up by other taxpayers: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\]. Therefore, I agreed with the Prosecution that the primary factor to be considered in determining the harm caused by the offence should be the amount of tax evaded.

83     However, I did find that whilst the quantum of tax evaded was the primary consideration in the level of harm caused by the offence, I should also consider whether the other harm factors, namely, whether the offence was syndicated, whether it was transnational or whether it undermined the Government were present. I found that if these other factors were not present then after the starting range was obtained after Step 2, the indicating starting sentence should then be adjusted downwards.

84     The Defence had conceded that the amount of tax evaded was a relevant factor but that it should not be the primary factor in determining the appropriate sentence. The Defence proposed additional factors to be considered as harm factors, see paragraph \[40\] above. I found that the factors the Defence were submitting should be included had **already** been included in the list of harm and culpability factors proposed by the Prosecution.

85     The Defence submitted that the Prosecution’s approach based on the _Taueki_ methodology was not appropriate because that methodology was intended to provide a guideline for offences involving serious violence. Referring to _Terence Ng_ at \[36\], the Defence submitted that the identification of a starting point sentence reflected the intrinsic seriousness of the offence and as such the _Taueki_ methodology should be reserved for “serious offences”. The Defence explained that it was not appropriate to apply such a methodology to tax evasion offences because tax evasion was not a serious offence in view of Singapore’s relative fiscal health.

86     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that there were no conceptual reasons to limit the methodology to “serious offences”. In any case, I found that tax evasion cases are “serious offences” and this was, in my opinion, made clear in _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[107\] where the Yong CJ highlighted that such offences were grave and tantamount to a fraud on the State such that general deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration. I gave no weight to the Defence submission that because of Singapore’s relative fiscal health tax evasion offences should not be considered serious. The purpose of the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework was to ensure consistency in sentencing of tax evasion offences.

87     I accepted the Prosecution’s list of factors affecting culpability with the exception that I found that steps taken by the offender to avoid detection and/or thwart the investigations should be included as a factor determining the offender’s culpability and not an offender-specific aggravating factor.

##### (2)   Step 2

88     At step 2 the court would have to determine the sentencing range regarding the level of harm and the relative culpability. The Prosecution’s matrix provided for three levels of harm; each level primarily determined by the amount of tax evaded. I agreed with the Prosecution’s calibration of three levels of harm based on the quantum of tax evaded. Referring to the Prosecution’s graph of charges for offences committed post-_Chng Gim Huat_ it was apparent that 39 out of the 51 charges were for tax evasion amounts under $75,000. This represented approximately 76.4% of all charges. Based on this historical review most cases that have come before the courts would involve Level 1 harm based on the quantum of tax evaded.

89     Level 2 and level 3 harm would be reserved for the most egregious cases. The table showed that of the remaining 12 charges, six charges were for tax evasion amounts between $75,000 and $150,000 and six charges for tax evasion amounts above $150,000. As such the Prosecution has proposed that $150,000 in the quantum of tax evaded should be the dividing line between Level 2 and Level 3 harm. I found that this calibration of the level of harm was reasonable especially as it would mean that for the majority of cases the level of harm would be at Level 1 based on the quantum of taxes evaded.

90     The Defence had taken issue with the Prosecution’s sentencing matrix as it did not allow for the imposition of fines and would have the effect of making sentences of imprisonment mandatory for tax evasion offences. I disagreed with this submission. The sentencing range for low harm and low culpability was a sentence up to six months’ imprisonment. There was no statutory requirement or indication in the matrix that a sentence of imprisonment was mandatory. It was conceivable that where the amount of tax evaded was very low and the level of culpability was similarly extremely low an indicative starting sentence of a fine could be assessed at step 3. Similarly, if there were extremely strong mitigating factors assessed at step 4 the indicative starting sentence could be discounted to warrant the impositions of a fine. However, I would also point out the it was clear from _Chng Gim Huat_ that a custodial sentence should be the norm for tax evasion offences and, therefore, it would be rare that a non-custodial sentence would be justified.

##### (3)   Step 3

91     Having identified the starting range then the court would have to decide on the indicative starting sentence based on the harm of caused by the offence and the offender’s relative culpability.

##### (4)   Step 4

92     At step 4 the court would consider offender-specific factors. I was in agreement with the Prosecution’s list of non-exhaustive factors, see paragraph \[25(d)\] above except that I found the factor regarding whether the offender had taken active steps to avoid detection and/or thwart the investigations should be considered at step 2 as a factor affecting culpability. Having taken the offender-specific factors into account the court wold be able to arrive at the appropriate sentence.

##### (5)   Step 5

93     I agreed that having arrived at the individual sentences the court should have a last look at the sentences to take into account the totality principle.

##### (6)   Conclusion

94     Therefore, I agreed with the Prosecution’s proposed 5-step sentencing framework and have used the framework to calibrate the appropriate sentences in the present case.

#### Whether the level of harm caused by the offence, in terms of the tax evaded, is addressed in the form of the mandatory treble penalty

95     The Defence contended that excessive weight had been given to the quantum of taxes evaded. The Defence further submitted that the amount of tax evaded had already been adequately factored into the sentencing calculus in the form of the mandatory treble penalty. This was a similar argument that was canvassed in _Tan Song Cheng_.

96     I disagreed with the Defence submission that the quantum of the tax evaded should not be considered as the primary element of the harm caused by the offence. In _Chng Gim Huat_ Yong CJ, at paragraph \[110\], in finding that the imposition of a fine was manifestly inadequate referred to the fact, _inter alia_, that the quantum of the “total tax evaded was substantial”. I found that the fact that Yong CJ had referred to the quantum of tax evaded as one of the reasons why a custodial sentence was merited demonstrated that he felt that the quantum of tax should be considered as a sentencing factor when determining the appropriate sentence for an offence under section 96(1) of the ITA.

97     Yong CJ had not held that as the quantum of tax evaded had been used to determine the mandatory penalty that it should not be used to determine the appropriate sentence. The Defence provided no other authority for this submission. As such, I found that the quantum of tax evaded was the most appropriate proxy to determine the level of harm caused by the offences and that using this factor to also determine the mandatory financial penalty did not amount to double-counting.

#### Application of the sentencing framework to the present case

98     Having found that I would be guided by the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework I have applied the framework to the present case.

##### (1)   Step 1

99     With regard to the harm caused I noted that the quantum of tax evaded by the Accused was $79,142.13. Based on the quantum of tax evaded alone I found that the harm would be just within the level 2 harm range. However, I also noted that there were no other harm factors present and, as such, I found that the level of harm should be classified as level 1 harm.

100    With regard to the Accused’s culpability, I found that the Accused’s scheme was not very sophisticated. She had simply asked her accountant to reduce FCC’s and YHFT’s sales income when these exceeded the $1-million threshold for GST-Registration. The Accused does not appear to have engaged in any other subterfuge to disguise her scheme.

101    I found that the primary intent behind the Accused’s scheme was not to personally benefit from income tax fraud but to ensure the competitiveness of her businesses. The income tax evasion was a consequence of this scheme rather than the driving purpose of the scheme. As such, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused’s culpability was in the low culpability bracket.

##### (2)   Step 2

102    Based on the level of harm and the culpability, I found that the applicable sentencing range would be a sentence of up to six months’ imprisonment.

##### (3)   Step 3

103    Based on the quantum of tax evaded and the Accused’s low culpability I found that a starting sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate.

##### (4)   Step 4

104    The primary aggravating factor in the present case was that the Accused had consented to one other charge under section 96(1) of the ITA being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The quantum of tax evaded in the TIC charges amounted to $7,654.46. I found that the TIC charge would warrant a slight uplift to the starting sentence.

105    I accepted that the Accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest possible opportunity and that this was an indication of his genuine remorse. I also noted that the Accused was cooperative with IRAS during their investigation. The Accused had made full restitution of the income tax that she had evaded and was in the process of paying back the GST amounts that were owing. I found that this was a weighty mitigating factor, as stated by Yong CJ making restitution was a significant indication of the Accused’s desire to make amends: see _Chng Gim Huat_ at \[112\]. Finally, I accepted as mitigating the fact that the Accused was untraced.

106    I did not give any mitigating weight to the Accused’s personal circumstances as I found that these were not so exceptional so as to warrant a further discount to the sentence.

107    Having balanced the aggravating factors with the mitigating factors I imposed a discount of approximately one-third to the starting sentence. I found that a sentence of ten weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for both charges.

##### (5)   Step 5

108    I found that the sentence of ten weeks’ did not offend against the totality principle.

#### Sentence for the section 61(1)(a) GSTA offence

109    With regard to the fine for the section 61(1)(a) of the GSTA offence, having perused the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents I found that a fine of $4,000 was appropriate.

## Conclusion

110    I found that a global sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the ITA offences was not disproportionate to the scale of the Accused’s offending and it was not a crushing sentence.

111    Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
