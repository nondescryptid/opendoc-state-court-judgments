\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9254/2019/01 .\]

6 April 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## I.   INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against conviction and sentence by the Accused, Ler Teck Siang (“Ler”). On 17 October 2019, I convicted and sentenced the Ler on two charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (“MDA”) for which he was on trial before me. In doing so, I delivered brief oral grounds for the conviction. This is an expansion of those grounds.

2       The Accused claimed trial to two drug charges. Briefly, these were as follows:

> (a)      **DAC-931956-2018:** for abetting, by intentionally aiding one Sim Eng Chee to consume _methamphetamine_ by administering the drug to Sim on 26 February 2018 at about 6.27 pm, in room 5665 of Swissotel, The Stamford, an offence under s.8(b)(ii) read with s.12 and punishable under s.33(1) of the MDA; and

> (b)      **DAC-931957-2018** : on about 2 March 2018, at about 4.15 pm, in the lobby of the Conrad Centennial Hotel, had in his possession a syringe, that was intended for the administration of a controlled drug, an offence under s.9 and punishable under s.33(1) of the MDA.

## II.   CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

3       Although there were numerous witnesses listed for the Prosecution, there was, in effect, only one material witness. This was PW22, Sim Eng Chee (“Sim”), the other protagonist in this tale. Sim had already pleaded guilty in a district court to drug consumption, drug possession and possession of utensils used for the consumption of drugs charges[^1]. He was sentenced to 17 months’ imprisonment with effect from 24 September. He is presently serving out the remainder of his sentence at a halfway house under a Home Detention Order.

### a.   Background

4       Sim is a self-confessed homosexual man and drug abuser. In his circle of homosexual “friends” (a term used very loosely), drug use was very common. Through an internet application known as _Grindr_, people of the same persuasion as Sim would arrange to meet, get high on various types drugs and engage in random and casual sex.

5       Sim was introduced to drugs at the end of 2016 and abused various types of drugs until his arrest on 2 March 2018. This included _methamphetamine_, ketamine ecstasy, cocaine, G water GBL etc. drugs until his arrest on 2 March 2018. He abused drugs with greater frequency through time, sometimes as often as 4 to 5 times per week. As such, he became very familiar with the different types of drugs used. He was therefore able to differentiate between the different effects that would result from the consumption of these different drug types. For example, whilst ketamine, a “downer”, made him feel relaxed, _methamphetamine_, a stimulant, made him _“become more focus, more awake …. more sexually aroused”_.[^2] The effects of the different drugs were very distinctive.

6       While Sim would sometimes consume _methamphetamine_ via the use of a “bong” or pipe, his preferred mode of consuming _methamphetamine_ was by injecting it intravenously, a method known as “slamming”. He explained that the high he derived from an intravenous injection of the drug was faster and stronger compared to the high derived from consuming _methamphetamine_ from a “bong”. While he was able to administer the injection himself, Sim preferred someone else do it as the process could be stressful and could cause much pain and injury if it was not done properly.

7       Sim had learnt from a sex buddy during a drug and sex session that Ler provided such “slamming” services. He obtained Ler’s _Grindr_ profile and began communicating with him. When Ler confirmed that he was providing such a service, Sim engaged his services. While the initial contacts between Sim and Ler were made through _Grindr_, thereafter, they communicated _via_ the Line application (“Line”). Sim does not recall that Ler’s _Grindr_ profile ever stating that he was providing a massage service nor was there ever a misunderstanding as to what the “slamming” service actually was.[^3]

8       Sim engaged Ler on numerous occasions to provide such “slamming” services through Line. This is apparent from the numerous text messages between Ler and Sim that were retrieved from Sim’s mobile phone[^4]. Sim would first contact Ler to determine if he was available to provide the “slamming” service. If Ler were available, he would then quote a price plus the cost of one-way transport for each “slam” and, should Sim require a repeat “slam”, he would be quoted a lesser amount plus the cost of one-way transport. Ler did not provide the drugs used in the “slam”. He simply provided the service of administering the injection.

9       A business-client relationship soon developed between Ler and Sim a form of mutual trust also began develop. For example, Ler would sometimes charge Sim preferential rates for the “slamming” services. On several occasion, Sim even paid for the services with “G” water instead of with cash. “G” water was apparently a substance that drug abusers consumed to lift the effect of other illicit drugs[^5] and Sim had access to a cheap supply of “G” water.

10     In the beginning, Sim would provide his own syringes and needles as well as the drug or drugs that were to be administered. He would also do all the preparations himself. All Ler would have to do was to inject the drugs into Sim’s veins. However, through time, Ler gained Sim’s confidence and trust. Soon, Sim would leave the preparation of the _methamphetamine_ solution to Ler. By September 2017, Ler would also be preparing the syringes. Thereafter, Ler started bringing his own syringes. Sim described Ler as being “_very professional in the execution of the intravenous injection”_.

### b.   Events at the Swissotel the Stamford, 26 February 2018

11     On 26 February 2018, Sim contacted Ler to provide “slamming” services at the Swissotel the Stamford (“Swissotel”). Ler was met by Sim and a sex buddy at the hotel lobby. They then proceeded to Room 5665 where there was another sex buddy waiting. The hotel’s CCTV[^6] captured Ler’s arrival at the Swissotel at about 1821 hrs and thereafter the trip up the elevator to Room 5665 about 3 minutes later.

12     When they arrived at Room 5665, Sim informed Ler that he “_wanted 0.3_”.[^7] Ler required no explanation as to what that he meant by this as he was familiar with what Sim wanted, namely that he wanted a syringe to be prepared with a solution containing 0.3 gm of _methamphetamine._ The drugs on the table included _methamphetamine_, ketamine, ecstasy and G Water. Whilst Ler prepared the syringe and _methamphetamine_, Sim went to the washroom to get himself ready for sex.

13     After Sim had washed up, he paid Ler the agreed payment for the “slam”. Ler then administered the _methamphetamine_ solution in the syringe into Sim _via_ an intravenous injection. Sim felt an immediate “high”. The “high” he felt was consistent with a “high” derived from the consumption of _methamphetamine_ and ketamine[^8]. Sim then packed up and left the hotel room. The hotel’s CCTV also captured his departure, which was timed at about 1850 hrs.

14     Sim is no longer in contact with the “sex buddies” that were with him in the room that day. Such hook ups for drug use and random sex were very common. In fact, he would not know the real names of these sex buddies even if they met up more than once for sex. At best, he would only them by the nicknames they used.

### c.   Events at the Conrad Centennial Hotel, 2 March 2018

15     In the evening of 1 March 2018, Sim checked into Room 1419 of the Conrad Centennial Hotel (“Conrad Hotel”). He spent the night in hotel room and woke up late morning the following day, ie. 2 March 2018. As he had enjoyed the stay in the room, Sim decided to extend his stay for another day. He did this online.

16     After extending his stay online, Sim left the Conrad Hotel at about 1300 hrs to obtain a fresh supply of _methamphetamine_ from his dealer in Geylang as his drug supply was running low. Sim informed the Court that he usually bought enough _methamphetamine_ to last two or three months. After buying the drugs, he would separate them into smaller portions for use at his sessions. This amount of _methamphetamine_ would usually cost him about $2,000. When Sim left the hotel, he left his drug items, including exhibits “SIM-4”[^9] and “SIM-5”[^10] locked in Room 1419’s safe.

17     After obtaining the drugs, Sim proceeded to see if he could hook up with sex partners. Having done so, at about 1443 hrs, while Sim was on his way back to the hotel, he contacted Ler on Line to procure “slamming” services[^11]. As explained by Sim, he would engage Ler only if he had managed a sex hook up, drugs and an available place to consume the drugs and have sex.

18     Unbeknownst to Sim, while he was away, the drugs and drug paraphernalia that he had kept in Room 1419’s safe were discovered by hotel staff. It appeared that by extending his stay at the Conrad Hotel online, he given another room. Room 1419 was therefore being prepared for the arrival of new guests. Hotel security officer PW1, Leela Wathy Krishnammah opened the locked safe. When she did so, she discovered the drugs and drug paraphernalia. The hotel senior management were informed. The police were then called and the room was locked.

19     When the police arrived, they took photographs of the drug exhibits in Room 1419 and ensured that the room was double locked when they left. Sim, using his key card, could now no longer open the room door. The police officers then awaited Sim’s return at the hotel’s Fire Command Centre (“FCC”). Meanwhile, as drugs were involved in this case, the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) were also informed.

20     At about 1540 hrs, Sim returned to the Conrad Hotel. Ler was waiting for him at the hotel lobby. They proceeded to Room 1419 but were unable to enter the room, as Sim’s key card could not work. They therefore headed back to the hotel reception to find out what was wrong. Sim began to sense that something was amiss and he told Ler to stay away from him[^12]. However, the police, with the help of hotel staff, subsequently detained both Sim and Ler. They were then brought to the FCC for questioning.

21     Soon, CNB officers arrived to take over the case. Both Sim and Ler were searched. Exhibits “Ler-1”, ‘Ler-2” and “Ler-3”[^13] were recovered from the Ler’s bag. Both Ler and Sim were placed under arrest. Ler was later brought back to CNB Headquarters for further investigation.

22     The items seized from Ler were later analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA"). “Ler-1”, the subject matter of the s.9 MDA charge was found to be one plastic container containing one 1-ml BD syringe stained with some brown substance. The syringe was rinsed and _methamphetamine_ was detected in the rinsing[^14]. “Ler-2” was found to be two straws that were stained with cocaine and _methamphetamine_[^15]. “Ler-3” was found to be one bottle stained with _methamphetamine[^16]_.

## III.   CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

### a.   Background

23     Ler denies ever providing any “slamming” services. Instead, he provided a “sport massage therapy service” that was “directed at …. relief of aches and pains, and sprains and strains”[^17]. He had advertised his services on several applications, including _Grindr_. He had started these massage services to obtain an alternate source of income after he had been charged with other offences and was unsure whether he would be able to renew his medical licence to continue practicing medicine when it expired.

24     Ler does not deny that he used the word “slamming” when he advertised on _Grindr_. His tagline was “_for a relaxing and slamming good time_”[^18]. While he understood that “slamming” could have alternate meanings, he did not know that it could mean injecting _methamphetamine_ into someone. He maintained that by “slamming”, he meant a “stimulating or invigorating good time”[^19] and it referred to the provision of his massage services Thereafter, because of this mistaken belief, the word “slamming” continued to be an on running inside joke between Sim and himself.

25     While Sim had made the initial contact with Ler via _Grindr_, subsequently, contact between the both of them were made through Line. Ler maintained that on the occasions that he met Sim to provide a service, it was for the various massage services that he offered. It was not for administering _methamphetamine_ or any other drugs.

26     In addition to providing massage services for Sim, he also provided Sim with medical advice, including seeing to Sim’s large abscess on his elbow. DW2, Dr Ng Tsong Chin, employed Ler as a _locum_ at one of the branches in his medical group, testified that, based on the medical records available, Sim’s abscess was large enough so that it would not have been resolved in a one-off treatment and could require between 2-5 months for the abscess to heal. Hence, regular cleaning of the wound would be required.

### b.   Events at the Swissotel the Stamford, 26 February 2018

27     On 26 February 2018, Sim contacted Ler for his services. As the price he charged for his service was time-based, he was sure that he asked how many persons would be requiring the service. As only Sim required his service, he quoted a price of $50. $30 for the service and $20 for transport.

28     There were other two persons in the room that day but Ler did not pay them much attention. He provided Sim with two services that day. In addition to the wound dressing change, he spent 10 to 15 minutes on a sports massage followed by a prostatic massage that took another 5 to 10 minutes[^20]. Once Sim had managed to achieve an erection, he left the room.

29     Other than the massage services and the wound dressing, Ler denies providing any other services. If he provided “slamming” services, namely to inject _methamphetamine_, he would have taken no longer than 5 minutes and would not have needed to spend the 20-25 minutes in the room. He did not notice the presence of any drugs in the room that day. Whilst he suspected that Sim was involved in drug taking, he did not enquire further as he did not want to know.

### c.   Events at the Conrad Centennial Hotel, 2 March 2018

30     On 2 March 2018, Sim contacted Ler for his services. Ler was asked to go to the Conrad Hotel. Ler quoted Sim $40 for the service, being $10 for transport and $30 for the service.

31     Ler arrived at the hotel about 20 minutes before Sim did. When Sim arrived, they went up to the 14th floor to Room 1419. Sim tried to enter Room 1419 by using his key card but was unable to do so. Therefore, both of them then went back downstairs. Sim then went to the hotel reception to enquire what was wrong while Ler read a book at the hotel lounge. It was while he was there that hotel security staff together with two police officers came up and brought Sim and Ler to the hotel’s FCC.

32     At the FCC, narcotics officers searched their belongings. What looked like drugs were recovered from Sim’s belongings. When his own belongings were searched, LER-1 was discovered.

## IV.   ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT

### a.   What Service did Ler Provide?

33     This is a factual issue. There are two versions. The first is Sim’s version, where Ler provided a service to inject _methamphetamine_ and other illicit drugs into his clients (in this case, Sim) known a “slam” or “slamming” or Ler’s version, where Ler provided various massage services, health advisory advice and, on occasion, medical advice.

#### (i)   The Line Messages

34     The objective evidence in this case are the Line messages retrieved from Sim’s mobile telephone[^21]. The crux of the Prosecution’s case rests on Sim’s evidence and his explanation of the various Line messages. I therefore had to consider the explanation(s) of the various Line messages from both Sim and Ler.

#### Message of 29 August 2017

35     On 29 August 2017, early in their business-client relationship, Sim engaged Ler for his services at the Hotel Indigo. He was charged $45. The next day, there was a lengthy Line conversation between Ler and Sim_[^22]_. It is reproduced below:

36     Ler explained the message in the following manner[^23]:

> (a)     he had serviced Sim with a perineum massage, ie. massaging the body that is between the scrotum and the anus followed by a prostatic massage. As he had not done a digital prostatic examination for a while, it took him multiple attempts to find Ler’s prostate. Hence his apology for the “multiple attempts”;

> (b)     he had seen an insulin syringe lying on the table and had later found out that Sim’s mother was a diabetic. He had therefore been explaining to Sim what were the differences between the different syringes and answering Sim’s questions regarding syringes;

> (c)     the message regarding the coke had been wrongly sent to Sim without him realising it. The message was meant for another friend. It was to create fake blood for that friend to play a prank on someone. He had used Coca-Cola in order to achieve a darker-looking solution.

37     Sim, on the other hand, gave evidence that on 29 August 2017, he had asked Ler whether he was free to provide “slamming” services, _“… which is the intravenous injection of meth”_[^24]. There was no need for either of them to be explicit as to what a “slamming” service was as he had previously contacted Ler to provide the same service though _Grindr_.

38     Sim’s version of the Line messages were that these were explanations by Ler as to why it took several attempts before the intravenous injection of _methamphetamine_ was successful. The reference to “coke” in the above message was a reference to cocaine. That day, Sim had prepared a solution of _methamphetamine_ **_and_** cocaine. This mixture resulted in a solution that was thicker than blood. Ler appeared not too familiar with injecting such a solution, hence there were two unsuccessful attempts in injecting this solution into Sim. Only after the drug mixture had been diluted further was the intravenous injection successful.

39     Notwithstanding the unsuccessful attempts, Sim was happy with the Ler’s skill and that this was the first time more than one attempt had been required to inject the drug. As Ler was apologetic, the offer of a 50% discount offered by Ler if Sim was to engage Ler’s service subsequently was, in Sim’s opinion, a form of service recovery for the failed attempts to retain Sim as a client.

40     While it is not evident from the Line messages what service was procured by Sim for 29 August 2017, a neutral observer reading Ler’s Line messages the following day would at the very least conclude that:

> (a)     Altitude (ie. Ler) was engaged to inject of a solution containing a mixture of “coke” and normal saline into the owner of SIM-HP2 (ie. Sim);

> (b)     At least 4 attempts were made by Ler before the injection were successful;

> (c)     The first two attempts failed because the needle of the Terumo syringe could not pierce or access the vein while the next two attempts failed because the mixture of “coke” and normal saline was too viscous;

> (d)     The 5th or last attempt went smoothly after the solution was further diluted with water;

41     I was not impressed with Ler’s explanation. Objectively speaking, Sim’s version is clearly the preferred one. It is both externally and internally consistent. For example, we can clearly see the flow of the message when Ler says that the reason _“the first two times failed”_ was because of the syringes and thereafter explains the failure of the next two attempts when Ler says that _“attempts number 3 and 4 failed as the solution was too viscous”_.

42     Ler’s attempt to explain the word “coke” in this message as being Coca-Cola, a soft drink, was untenable and was, in my view extremely unlikely. His explained that this portion of the message related to the making of fake blood meant for another person. He had accidentally copied it to Sim and he had not realised it until much later. This was disingenuous. It is clear and obvious that the entire message was meant for Sim and Sim alone.

43     In my mind, this message showed that Sim engaged Ler to inject drugs intravenously into his vein. This included cocaine. Ler was offering an apology and explaining why he had required so many attempts at injecting Sim before he was successful. Ler was trying to explain and was offering a discount for subsequent services to keep his customer happy.

#### Message of 1 September 2017: Needles and “pokes”?

44     On 1 September 2017, Sim again engaged Ler for his services at the Hotel Intercontinental. Prior to Ler arriving, Sim sent him three messages[^25]. The first read _“Reach le let me know”_ and immediately followed by another which said _“And my needle not prepared too”_ and a third, _“0.33”._ Sim explained the second and third messages. By this time, Ler had gained the Sim’s trust and Sim was informing Ler that he had not prepared the needle for the “slam” with the impression that Ler would help him prepare the needle. The reference to “_0.33”_ was a reference to the weight of the _methamphetamine_ that he hope Ler could put into the syringe before diluting the drug with other solution like saline[^26].

45     Ler, on the other hand, had a simple explanation; he understood it as a joke. He once again referenced this to how the word “slam” was a running inside joke between Sim and himself.

46     This explanation is not sustainable. It comes out of nowhere. This is even starker if one reads all the Line messages between Sim and Ler on 1 September 2017 to appreciate the context of this particular message. Sim’s version is the more logical explanation.

47     After Ler had left the Hotel Intercontinental, he wrote to Sim saying _“….. Sorry I poked you twice before going to the forearm. Next time I’ll probably go there straightaway …..”[^27]_

48     Ler’s explanation[^28] was, once again, rather curious. He explained that:

> (a)     “_Poke_” meant a poke in the Facebook Messenger application. He used this to indicate his arrival to Sim. He used the Facebook Messenger application as he found it caused the least disruption to the online game that he played;

> (b)     “_Forearm_” was originally meant to read “foreman” but was autocorrected by Line. The reference to “foreman” was there because Sim had introduced him such to someone that was there; and

> (c)     “_Go there straightaway_,” meant going to the lift lobby immediately, instead of waiting at the lounge.

49     I agreed with the Prosecution that Ler’s explanation seems absurd. If one were to accept Ler’s explanation, the most obvious question was why would Ler need to apologise to Sim for going to the “foreman” or innocuously “poking” Sim twice on Facebook **_after_** already leaving the hotel and performing his “slamming” services[^29]? As I mentioned at \[46\], when one reviews all the Line messages between Ler and Sim for 1 September 2017, it does not support Ler’s explanation at all.

50     The true explanation for the message is the most obvious one. Sim had engaged Ler to provide a “slamming” service, which is to say, to inject Sim with a drug intravenously. Sim had not prepared the needle for the “slam” and hoped that Ler would do so and with the amount of _methamphetamine_ that he wanted. Ler tried to inject Sim twice before he went to the forearm. He then assured Sim that on the next occasion, he would inject or “poke” Sim in the forearm at the first attempt. Ler’s explanation is therefore simply not believable.

#### Message of 30 September 2017: a double slam?

51     On 30 September 2017, Sim requested a “double slam” from Ler. Ler replied that Sim’s _“… one arm already not easy to find. If it’s higher volume you want, I have 3 ml syringe”[^30]._

52     Sim explained that by “double slam”, he was exploring the possibility of having _“two injections going in at the same time to create … a even better high”_[^31]_._ With regard to the rest of the message, Sim further explained that his veins were already difficult to find, and this was another reason why he preferred someone else to administer the injection. In this instant, Ler was trying to discourage him from getting two injections.

53     Ler, on the other hand, explained that “double slam” meant a prostatic massage using two fingers instead of one. The “one arm” meant one finger. He went on to explain that the reference to the 3 ml syringe was a reference to the use of three fingers. The reference to the “double slam” went back to the running joke between Sim and himself regarding the use of the word “slam”.

54     It was extremely difficult to accept Ler’s explanation. It is quite absurd that three different terms used here meant the same thing ie. his fingers. Ler is clutching at straws in attempting to explain away the incriminating Line messages. In my view, the correct and more likely explanation for this message is the most obvious one. Ler was surprised that Sim wanted to have two intravenous injections as it was already not easy to find a vein for one injection and Ler went on to suggest that if Sim wanted a higher dosage (of drugs) to be injected intravenously, he ie. Ler, would do so by using a larger capacity syringe.

#### “G” or “G” Water[^32]

55     Line messages show that Ler obtained “G” from Sim, offering to offset the cost of the “G” with subsequent “slamming” services. Sim explained that “G” is actually “G Water” and is a non-narcotic and regularly used in drug consumption. It is a substance that drug abusers regularly consumed to lift the effect of other illicit drugs.[^33]

56     Ler, on the other hand, sought to explain that “G” was a “growth potion” used in a virtual online game that he used to play. Sim played the same game. As Sim’s character in the game was at a higher level than his own character, Sim could purchase the “G” at a cheaper price. Therefore, when Ler purchased this product from Sim, he would at times offset it against his services.

57     I found Ler’s explanation as to what “G” was curious again, to say the least. The assertion that “G” referred to a growth potion in an online game appeared to be a convenient excuse as he gave evidence that he could no longer even remember the name of the game that was played[^34]. Even more curious is that Ler had not even questioned Sim about the nature of “G” or anything regarding the virtual game at all in cross-examination.

58     A plain reading of the Line exchange between Sim and Ler suggested an exchange of a physical product and not a virtual one. Ler’s subsequent explanation that the exchange of “G” from one player to another required the two devices to be in close proximity with each other seems extremely unlikely for a **_virtual_** and **_online_** game. In fact, it appears that Ler himself was aware the “G” was not a virtual item. Once, when Sim wanted a second “slam”, Ler declined as he _“ …. just took g …. I won’t be of any use for the next few hours.”[^35]_ This was indeed a strange effect for a virtual item.

59     In short, Sim’s explanation of what “G” or “G Water” was and how it was used to offset “slamming” services provided by Ler was, again, clearly the more logical explanation. To accept Ler’s explanation of the same would defy the realms of incredulity. Furthermore, Ler’s own Line message suggests that “G” was not a virtual item. I therefore had no doubt that “G” was not a virtual item.

#### (ii)   Why Sim’s evidence should be believed over Ler’s

60     Sim came across as one who has seen the error of his ways and was truly remorseful. He appeared to want a break from the past. I was impressed with his evidence. He was clear, unequivocal and forthright. He answered questions succinctly, candidly and to the point, even if the answers were likely to cause him embarrassment or put him in bad light.

61     Sim did not have any reason to lie. He had already been convicted for drug offences and was still serving his sentence under a Home Detention Order at a halfway house. Ler had attempted to discredit Sim’s evidence by suggesting that Sim was giving evidence that was favourable to the Prosecution because he cut a deal with the Prosecution[^36].

62     I thought that this was disingenuous. However, Sim put paid to Ler’s suggestion that he had been given a more lenient sentence to give evidence against him when he revealed that the sentence imposed by the judge for his drug offences were higher than what the prosecutor had suggested.

63     In **_Sim Eng Chee_**, one of the charges Sim originally faced was a drug trafficking charge. The drug trafficking charge was later reduced to one of drug possession. Eventually, Sim pleaded guilty to one drug possession charge, one drug consumption charge and one charge for being in possession of utensils intended to be used for the consumption of drugs. Although the prosecution in **_Sim Eng Chee_** submitted for a 12 month imprisonment term for the drug possession charge, Sim was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. In total, Sim was sentenced to 17 months’ imprisonment. Notwithstanding this, he chose not to appeal against the sentence imposed. In my mind, it Sim’s remorse for his actions showed when he accepted the sentence imposed. I was of the view that Ler’s allegation against Sim had no credit.

64     I note that Ler’s main defence at trial, that he that he was providing a massage service, was one that has only been raised at trial. This fact was not raise in either of his statements[^37] to IO SSGT Adly Idzuan bin Roslan (PW23). This was also not raised in the Case for the Defence where Ler claimed he provided a health advisory service. I agreed with the Prosecution that Ler’s explanation for this omission, namely that he had feared prosecution for an offence under s.377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224) was, once again, was disingenuous and illogical. At that point in time, Ler a more serious drug trafficking charge under s.5 of the MDA at that point in time. The offence carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane.

65     Ler has given his explanations for the various Line messages. For the reasons that I have already highlighted, I found his explanations difficult to accept. At its highest, some of the explanations given could have withstood cursory scrutiny when looked at individually. However, taken in their entirety, in particular the context in which they were made, the explanation(s) show the lengths that Ler would go is trying to explain messages that were detrimental to him. The explanations were described by the Prosecution were illogical. I agreed. Some of his explanations were unbelievable. As I had highlighted above, Ler was a man clutching at straws.

66     Lastly, I would also highlight that for whatever reason(s), many of the explanations given by the Ler were never put to Sim. It fortified by view that Ler did not provide any massage service but instead, provided the “slamming” services as described by Sim.

67     Therefore, all considered, I have no hesitation in concluding the Ler provided Sim with a service known as “slamming”. This service involved Ler injecting a drug mixture, intravenously into Sim. Sim paid Ler for his service. While Ler may have, on occasion, provided actual medical advice to Sim, this was only incidental to the actual “slamming” service that Ler provided.

#### (iii)   Evidence of DW3 Lefebvre Chris Bryan

68     I will briefly touch on the evidence of Mr Lefebvre. Mr Lefebvre is a friend of Ler. He had accompanied Ler on his trips to see Sim on at least 2 occasions, 4 and 31 January 2018. He was brought along to provide diabetic advice to Sim. On both occasions, he only saw Ler help change Sim’s dressing. He did not see Ler administering any _methamphetamine_ injections to Sim[^38].

69     I was of the view that Mr Lefebvre’s evidence was neither here nor there. At best, it showed that Ler did, on occasion, provide medical services and perhaps did not administer any _methamphetamine_ injections to Sim on the two dates. However, it did not convince me as to the nature of the service provided by Ler.

### b.   Whether Ler intentionally aided Sim in consuming methamphetamine by giving him an intravenous injection containing the drug in Room 5665 of the Swissotel on 26 February 2018

70     Sim described clearly on what happened on 26 February.[^39] In summary, he booked Room 5665 at the Swissotel and engaged Ler to provide “slamming” services[^40]. He and a “sex buddy” met Ler at the lobby of the hotel. They then went up to room 5665 where there was another “sex buddy” waiting. Before Sim went to wash up to get ready for sex, he told Ler that he wanted _“0.3”._ This referred to the amount of _methamphetamine_ he wanted Ler to prepare. This amount of drug would be dissolved in other solutions before it would be injected intravenously into him. In addition to _methamphetamine_, there were also other drugs in the room.

71     When Sim came out of the washroom, the syringe was ready. Ler then wrapped a tourniquet provided by Sim around his arm to ensure that his veins were visible. Ler then swabbed the area where he was going to insert the needle with an alcoholic swab. He then proceeded to inject the drug mixture intravenously into Sim. Sim’s high was immediate and feeling was consistent with being injected with _methamphetamine_ and ketamine. After “slamming” Sim, Ler would then clear up and leave. Ler would usually dispose of the used syringe. The whole episode would last about 20 minutes or so.

72     Ler’s evidence is that he was in the Room 5665 but the service was he provided was a massage and a wound dressing service[^41]. He did not see any other drugs in the room, nor did he administer any injection.

73     I accepted Sim’s evidence as the version of events that happened in Room 5665. He was a truthful witness. I have no doubt that the version of events as described by Sim was what actually what happened that day. The whole reason behind engaging Ler was for a “slam” and not for any massage. As such, I rejected Ler’s version of events.

74     Accordingly, I find that Ler knew that the drug concerned was _methamphetamine_ when he was preparing the syringe and proceeded to intentionally aid Sim in consuming _methamphetamine_ by giving him an intravenous injection containing the said drug in Room 5665 of the Swissotel on 26 February 2018.

### c.   Whether the syringe found in Ler possession at the Conrad Hotel on 2 March 2018 intended for the administration of a controlled drug

75     Ler had the syringe in his possession on 2 March at about 1625 hrs at the Conrad Hotel. The CNB officers discovered the syringe when they were checking through Ler’s belongings in the FCC. By Ler’s own account, he had placed the syringe in his bag himself. However, he had given differing reasons as to how the syringe came into his possession and what the syringe was for:

> (a)     When initially question by the CNB officers at the FCC as to what he intended to use the items LER-1, LER-2 and LER-3 for, Ler replied that he was a doctor and that _“ this syringe was actually used to …. inject insulin into his patients”;_[^42]

> (b)     In his original statement to IO Adly, his account was that he had purchased the syringe from a pharmacy and he intended to use this syringe to squirt water at his teeth to dislodge stuck food particles;[^43]

> (c)     Subsequently, after the Ler was shown that the HSA Certificate that the syringe was stained with _methamphetamine_, he claimed that he had found this syringe from his spouse, Mr Brochez’s, study room when clearing it and had kept it in his bag in order to dispose of it safely.[^44]

76     Ler explained that when the CNB officers at the FCC first discovered the syringe, he was asked, “_what is this type of syringe?_” by the CNB officer, he was under the impression that the CNB Officers did not recognise an insulin syringe. Hence, he told them it was an insulin syringe used for administering insulin.[^45]

77     Initially, he could not remember how the syringe had gotten into his bag. He deduced that if he had used the syringe professionally, to administer an injection at a clinic, he would have already disposed of it. Therefore, he concluded that he had bought the syringe for his personal use, to act as a floss substitute as he had sensitive gums. The syringe would generate a jet of water to dislodge food particles stuck in his teeth. He did not link the syringe with drug use. It was only when the HSA Certificate came back to show that the syringe was stained with _methamphetamine_ that he remembered that he had recovered the syringe from Mr Brochez’s study upon the expiry of the apartment’s lease. He claimed not to know how Mr Brochez used the syringe. He put the syringe in his bag, in a separate compartment with the intention to dispose it safely later. The syringe remained in his bag until it was discovered on 2 March 2018.[^46]

78     Ler’s assertion that he did not know for sure what Mr Brochez had used the syringe for when he found it also leaves much to be desired. Mr Brochez was Ler’s ex-spouse and this apartment was co-rented by the both of them. It was doubtful that Ler did not know what Mr Brochez was up to in their own apartment. In August 2017, when Ler supposedly found the syringe in Mr Brochez’a study, Mr Brochez had already been convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for drug possession charges.[^47] In my view, Ler must have known that Mr Brochez was involved in drugs. I also agreed with the Prosecution that it is inconceivable that Ler could suddenly remember the “true origin” of the syringe only upon the seeing the HSA Certificate. It appears to be a blatant attempt to push to blame on Mr Brochez, who conveniently is no longer in Singapore. Once again, I found Ler’s attempts to explain away incriminating evidence with different explanations disingenuous. It is plain that his claim of finding the syringe in Mr Brochez’s study room is an afterthought. In fact, in my view, this showed Ler’s calculated attempts to explain away a piece of incriminating evidence, only to have to change his story when it could not be sustained on closer scrutiny.

79     I have found that Ler provided Sim “slamming” services, that is, to inject _methamphetamine_ intravenously. Sim’s testimony and the Line messages on 2 March 2018 corroborates the reason why Ler was at the Conrad Hotel. This, together with the fact that the syringe was found with other drug-stain instruments, namely LER-2 and LER-3 leads me to conclude the syringe found in Ler’s belongings was intended for the administration of a controlled drug.

## V.   CONVICTION

80     Based on the evidence before me, I found that the Prosecution has proven their case beyond reasonable doubt that Ler did:

> (a)     on 26 February 2018, at about 6.27 pm, at Room 5665 of the Swissotel abetted, by intentionally aiding Sim Eng Chee in consuming _methamphetamin_e by administering the _methamphetamine_ into Sim Eng Chee by means of an intravenous injection; and

> (b)     on 2 March 2018 at about 4.15 pm at the Conrad, after being engaged by Sim to provide “slamming” services, did have in his possession a syringe that was intended to be used for the administration of _methamphetamine._

81     I accordingly found Ler, the Accused, guilty and convicted him on both charges.

## VI.   SENTENCING SUBMISSIONS

82     After finding Ler guilty, I enquired from him as to what he intended to do with the two other charges that were stood down at the start of the trial. These were for failing, without excuse, to provide a sample of urine for analysis under Section 31 of the MDA and another for an offence under s.5(1)(e) read with s.5(1)(iv) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213, Rev Ed 2012). The Prosecution offered to have these two charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing provided the Accused admitted and consented to do so. However, Ler maintained his plea of not guilty for these two charges.

83     The Prosecution made an oral submission for a global sentence of 15 months imprisonment and this sentence was to commence after the expiry of the present sentence he was serving as they were committed on separate transactions and relate to different legally protected interest.

84     The 15 month imprisonment term was broken down to a 15 month imprisonment for intentionally aiding Sim in consuming the _methamphetamin_e under s.8(b) of the MDA and 3 month imprisonment term for the “utensils” charge under s.9 of the MDA. The Prosecution submitted that there should be an uplift from the usual sentencing range of 8 – 12 months imprisonment for the s.8(b) MDA charge as there were aggravating factors in the instant case. These were namely:

> (a)     Ler was a medical professional who had made use of his medical skills and expertise to commit the offence and in essence fuelled Sim’s addiction to illicit drugs;

> (b)     The offences were committed for greed;

> (c)     Ler committed these offences whilst he was on bail for other offences.

85     In mitigation, Ler told the court that the service that he provided was not part of the medical profession. Sim had also engaged other persons to inject him with drugs, therefore what he did had nothing to do with the medical profession. In addition, Ler also highlighted that the 15 months’ imprisonment term was almost double, what Sim had received for the drug consumption charges.

86     In _Dinesh Singh Bhatia v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> at \[38\] established a sentencing range of six – 18 months’ imprisonment for first time offenders convicted for the offence of drug consumption. Factors like the age of the offender; the quantity of drugs; the circumstances that led to the consumption of drugs; whether the offender was a first time drug consumer, a casual consumer or an addict factors etc were relevant in calibrating the precise sentence. In _Dinesh Singh Bhatia_, the court was of the view that the lower end of this range was applicable to younger offenders and sentenced the accused to 8 months’ imprisonment.

87     The facts in the instant case warranted a sentence on the higher end of this range. I considered several factors in my determination. Unlike in a usual case in which an accused would have consumed the drug himself, Ler had abetted another to consume _methamphetamine_. This was a paid service. As a medical doctor, he would have known that these acts would cause harm to those that he provided the service to by continuing to feed their addiction. These were, in my mind, aggravating factors.

88     Ler was unrepentant for his actions. Whilst it is his right to claim trial to the charges, his defence was essentially a sham defence. The various explanations that he gave for the incriminating Line messages were absurd and the speed at which he changed his story did not put him in good light. I also note that Ler was actually on bail for other offences when he committed these two drug offences. This factor alone would justify a sentence on the higher end of this scale.

## VII.   SENTENCE IMPOSED

89     Accordingly I sentenced the Ler to the following:

> (a)      **DAC-931956-2018** : 15 months’ imprisonment

> (b)      **DAC-931967-2018** : 3 months’ imprisonment

90     As the Prosecution did not press for consecutive sentences, I ordered that the two sentences run concurrently. As I also agreed with the Prosecution that the sentence should run from the expiry of the present sentences that Ler was serving, the total sentence imposed on Ler was:

**15 months’ imprisonment**

**with effect from the expiry of the present imprisonment term**

## VIII.   POSTSCRIPT

91     Being dissatisfied with my decision, Ler has since filed an appeal against his conviction and the sentence imposed. He is presently serving sentence.

92     As Ler has claimed trial to the two remaining charges, the case was sent back to the Pre-Trial Conference Centre for further manage.
