\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9844/2020/01-02 and MA 9845/2020/01.\]

27 November 2020

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The first accused, Ryan Xavier Tay Seet Chong (“Ryan”), male, 24 years, was convicted after trial on the following amended charge:-

> **DAC 902844-2018**

> \[a\]re charged that you on 9th day of July 2016 at or about 7.50 p.m. at 5th floor staircase landing of Blk 279 Yishun Street 22, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Shawn Ignatius Rodrigues (male / 26 years’ old), _to wit_, by stomping on his shoulder, punching his face and head multiple times, forcefully pushing his face to the ground, and pressing your knee on his back for about 20 minutes, causing the said Shawn Ignatius Rodrigues to sustain traumatic asphyxia with head injury which led to his death, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       He was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment on 5 October 2020. At his request, sentence was deferred to 20 October 2020. Ryan has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence, while the Public Prosecutor has filed an appeal against sentence.

3       The second accused, Lim Peck Beng Lawrence (“Lawrence”), male, 57 years, was at the same trial convicted on the following charge:-

> **DAC 902845-2018**

> \[a\]re charged that you on 9th day of July 2016 at or about 7.50 p.m. at 5th floor staircase landing of Blk 279 Yishun Street 22, Singapore, did intentionally abet by aiding one Ryan Xavier Tay Seet Choong (male / 23 years’ old) to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Shawn Ignatius Rodrigues (male / 26 years’ old), _to wit_, by sitting on the said Shawn Ignatius Rodrigues’s buttocks and holding his legs, while the said Ryan Xavier Tay Seet Choong was punching his face and head multiple times, forcefully pushing his face to the ground; and pressing his knee on the said Shawn Ignatius Rodrigues’s back for about 20 minutes, causing the said Shawn Ignatius Rodrigues to sustain fractures of the nasal bones and medial wall of the right orbit, which act was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 325 read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)

4       Lawrence was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, deferred to 20 October 2020. He has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. There is no cross-appeal against sentence by the Public Prosecutor.

5       After the Notices of Appeal were filed, a mention was fixed on 20 October 2020 for the accused persons to apply for bail pending appeal. Both chose not to do so. Instead, they elected to start serving sentence that day.

## Background facts

6       Ryan is the stepson of Lawrence. They lived at Apt Blk 279 Yishun Street 22 #XXX (“the unit”). Ng Hui Eng Irene (“Irene”) who is Ryan’s mother also lived there. Irene is Lawrence’s wife. She married him after her divorce from Ryan’s father. I will refer to them collectively as “the family”.

7       Ryan and Shawn Ignatius Rodrigues (“the deceased”) met in 2006 when they were altar boys at The Lady Star of the Sea church at Yishun. When church members teased the deceased (whom Ryan felt was mentally slow), Ryan stood up for him. The deceased then tried to get close to him and started to message him. Ryan did not feel comfortable and avoided the deceased.[^1]

8       The deceased was banned from the church in 2012 or 2013 for reasons which are not relevant to this case. There was no interaction between Ryan and the deceased from then until 2014, when the deceased was re-admitted as an altar boy.[^2] Things did not go well. On one occasion, the deceased used Ryan’s photograph as his WhatsApp display picture. Ryan confronted the deceased who denied it was wrong to do so. The deceased then started to contact Ryan. Ryan felt uncomfortable as the deceased constantly pressed him about his personal life. He decided to quit the church about two months after the deceased returned.[^3]

### The deceased harassed the family

9       After Ryan stopped going to church, the deceased started to stalk him. He followed Ryan, sent messages to his handphone, and made numerous nuisance calls. When Ryan changed his handphone number, the deceased confronted him. He wanted to know why Ryan left the church and was avoiding him. The deceased also loitered around the next block and along the corridor outside the unit. He accosted Ryan when Ryan was on his way to school and followed him to the bus stop. The deceased also waited for Ryan after school.[^4]

10     When Ryan started national service in May 2016, his schedule became unpredictable. The deceased started to become more confrontational and aggressive.[^5] According to Lawrence, the deceased started to harass Irene in 2015 by sending her multiple texts, sometimes in the middle of the night. He loitered at the adjacent block. He peeped into the unit from the adjacent block and visited the unit on multiple occasions to ask for Ryan. Lawrence tried to reason with the deceased. This was to no avail as the deceased was insistent on seeing Ryan.[^6]

11     Irene alleged in her police report dated 27 March 2016, that the deceased had followed her when she was walking her two dogs. He pulled at her shoulder and arm. This led to a struggle, during which Irene suffered scratches to her left arm. She felt intimidated and threatened by the deceased and felt that he had outraged her modesty.[^7] This incident particularly irked Ryan.

12     In another incident which also upset Ryan, the mother of a neighbour claimed that the deceased assaulted her on 5 July 2016. Ur Kok Seng (PW 8) stated in his conditioned statement (CS-15) that the deceased punched his mother twice after she saw him knocking on the door of the unit and reprimanded him. Ryan had seen ambulance officers attending to her when he came home.

### The family tried to prevent the harassment

13     Not unexpectedly, the family was traumatised by the harassment. They made 59 police reports against the deceased (Exhibits DB 1-67). The first report was lodged on 22 February 2015. The last report was on 9 July 2016 at 5.15 p.m., a few hours before the deceased’s death.

14     The family felt that the police did not do enough to help them. Lawrence testified that despite the numerous police reports, the deceased was never detained or questioned. Irene filed a Magistrate’s Complaint sometime in January 2016 at the State Courts. Lawrence and she attended two mediation sessions with the deceased and his mother. The judge warned the deceased not to visit the unit, but he continued to do so. Irene and Lawrence also went to see their Member of Parliament who escalated their case to Ang Mo Kio Police Division.[^8]

15     Ryan and Lawrence also undertook certain measures to deter the deceased from harassing them. They confronted the deceased when he appeared. They tried to scare the deceased by assaulting him. As summarized by the prosecution in their final submissions, Ryan assaulted the deceased on the following occasions:-[^9]

> (a)     Sometime in 2015, the deceased approached Ryan outside the unit and grabbed his hand. Ryan kicked the deceased in the stomach;

> (b)     In 2015, the deceased approached Ryan at the void deck when Ryan was walking his dog. The deceased asked Ryan for his handphone number. Ryan threw a stick at the deceased’s upper body. When the deceased grabbed the dog’s leash, Ryan kicked him on his right hip;

> (c)     On 23 June 2015, the deceased approached Ryan along the corridor outside the unit. He asked Ryan for his phone number and grabbed Ryan’s hand. Ryan kicked him in the stomach. When the deceased continued to follow him, Ryan punched him in the chest and struck his face with a shoe bag; and

> (d)     During a second incident on 23 June 2015, the deceased pulled Ryan’s haversack at the staircase landing outside the unit. Ryan turned around, punched the deceased in the stomach and pushed him against a wall. When the deceased doubled over, Ryan struck the deceased’s face with his right knee. As a result, the deceased’s mouth bled and he lost some teeth.

16     Lawrence took his own measures against the deceased on the following occasions:-[^10]

> (a)     In early 2016, the deceased knocked on the door of the unit. Lawrence opened the door and sprayed insecticide in the deceased’s face for about a minute;

> (b)     On 9 January 2016, when the deceased visited the unit, Lawrence chased the deceased and discharged the contents of a fire extinguisher on him;

> (c)     On 6 March 2016, the deceased showed up when Lawrence and his family were having a celebration at a coffeeshop. Lawrence threw a chair at him; and

> (d)     On 4 July 2016, the deceased knocked on the door of the unit. Lawrence opened the door and gate. As the deceased ran away, Lawrence hit the deceased in his back and thigh with a baseball bat.

17     These incidents have been set out for the sake of completeness. However, I did not place any weight on them in determining whether the accused persons had committed the offences. In my view, the evidence of prior assaults had a prejudicial effect and little probative value.

## Psychological reports on the deceased

18     After the complaint was made by Irene, the State Courts referred the deceased to the Centre for Psychotherapy on 4 May 2016. The deceased received ten counselling sessions from Dr Nisha Rani (PW10) (“Dr Nisha”), the last of which was on the day he died. She also saw his mother and father and tried to devise strategies to discourage him from harassing the family.

19     Dr Nisha thought that the deceased could have suffered from “erotomania” and informed the court of this on 11 June 2016. She noticed that he needed psychiatric attention with psychotherapy or counselling intervention.[^11]

20     Dr Susan Zachariah (PW9), a Consultant Psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) saw the deceased on 7 July 2016. She stated in her report (Exhibit P9) that he had oddities in his speech and demeanour. He also had an obsessive pre-occupation suggestive of possible Asperger’s Syndrome and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. She referred him to the Adult Neurodevelopment Clinic for further evaluation and treatment.

21     The assessment of the deceased was only at a preliminary stage and no actual diagnosis had been made at the time of his death.

## Events of Saturday, 9 July 2016

22     On the day of his death, the deceased attended a counselling session with Dr Nisha. He indicated that he would be visiting the unit after the session. Dr Nisha tried to discourage him from doing so, but the deceased was insistent. On that day, the deceased went to the unit on five occasions. Irene called the police at 8.41 a.m., 9.59 a.m. and 5.15 p.m. to report his presence. He also visited the unit at about 7.00 p.m. and 7.40 p.m..

23     The events which occurred that night were by and large not in dispute. The narrative was contained in the statements which the accused persons gave to the police. These were:-

> (a)     Ryan’s statements recorded on 10 July 2016 (Exhibit P16) and 15 September 2016 (Exhibit P17); and

> (b)     Lawrence’s statements recorded on 10 July 2016 (Exhibit P18) and 19 September 2016 (Exhibit P19).

24     The accused persons did not challenge the voluntariness of their statements. They confirmed in court that the statements were recorded accurately and that they were true and correct.

25     In Exhibit P16, Ryan stated that when the deceased knocked on the door of the unit at about 7.00 p.m., both Lawrence and he ignored the deceased. Ryan messaged Irene (who was out walking the dog) to inform her that the deceased was around. She asked him to call the police. He told her, “I want to whack him.” He clarified in his further statement (Exhibit P17) that he wanted to hit the deceased so that the deceased would not disturb them further.[^12]

26     The deceased returned at about 7.40 p.m.. The door of the unit was open, but the gate was shut. Lawrence was very irritated and raised his voice.[^13] Ryan heard the commotion and came out of his bedroom. When the deceased saw Ryan, he ran down the corridor towards the lift lobby. Ryan chased after him, barefooted and was just wearing a pair of muaythai shorts.[^14]

27     Ryan chased the deceased up some stairs near “lift landing B”. The deceased lost his balance and fell, ending up on all fours. Ryan jumped on him and grabbed his back with his hands. When the deceased pushed himself up, Ryan became scared and let go. Ryan then grabbed the deceased’s shirt with his left hand. The deceased responded by swinging his right hand which struck Ryan on his right shoulder. While grabbing the deceased’s shirt, Ryan managed to push the deceased forcefully against the staircase railing. At this point, Ryan lost his balance and grabbed the left part of the deceased’s shirt. Both of them tumbled down the stairs and ended up at the landing on the sixth floor.[^15]

28     The deceased landed on top of Ryan with his back on Ryan. Ryan flipped the deceased over so that the deceased was face down. He applied an arm lock on the deceased for about one minute by pulling the deceased’s right arm towards the neck. When Ryan stood up, the deceased struggled and tried to get up. Ryan then stamped on the deceased’s shoulder twice with his right heel, causing the deceased to drop to the floor.[^16]

29     According to Ryan, Lawrence appeared at this juncture and assisted him by grabbing the deceased’s legs. Using his right knee, Ryan applied pressure to the deceased’s upper back area, while his left knee was on the floor. The deceased was in a face down position with his hands spread on the floor.[^17]

30     Even though the deceased did not struggle, Ryan used his fist and punched the left part of the deceased’s head near his ear, twice. When the deceased turned his head, Ryan punched the deceased once on the right side of his head, also near the ear. The deceased did not move but Ryan continued to press his knee on the deceased’s upper back.[^18]

31     Ryan then found the deceased’s bag, rummaged through it and found a notebook. He tore up the notebook and threw the pieces down the stairs. The deceased struggled and tried to get up. When the deceased lifted his head, Ryan used his right hand and pushed the back of the deceased’s head hard onto the floor. The deceased moved both his hands and rested his face on his hands. Ryan saw blood on the floor and tilted the deceased’s face to the left. Ryan saw blood coming from the deceased’s nose but continued to press his right knee on the deceased’s upper back.[^19]

32     After about five minutes, some members of public arrived. Ryan asked them to call for the police. Zailani bin Rani (PW5) called the police at about 7.58 p.m.. The accused persons also asked for some rope. Madam Foo Wai Keng (PW6) went home and got two strips of raffia. She and her husband Lim Hock Piou (PW7) then returned to the scene, where her husband helped tie the deceased’s legs.[^20] Ur Kok Seng (PW8) also rushed home to get some rope. He got two blue nylon ropes and one white rope from his kitchen drawer. He returned to the scene and threw the ropes on the floor.[^21]

33     Even after the police were called, Ryan maintained pressure on the deceased’s back. He saw Lawrence sitting on the deceased. When the deceased moved his back, Ryan became agitated again and shifted his position. He then punched the deceased four to five times at the rear of his head. While doing so, he shouted at the deceased and chastised him for coming to the unit, molesting his mother, and for punching and strangling his elderly neighbour. He also shouted at him not to move.[^22]

34     Ryan continued to press his knee on the deceased’s upper back until the police arrived about 15 minutes later, while Lawrence continued to sit on the deceased and hold on to his legs. When the police arrived, Ryan checked the deceased’s neck for a pulse using his fingers before he stood up. He felt a very week pulse and noted that the accused was still breathing.[^23]

35     After he was arrested, Ryan was examined by Dr Lee Zhi Quan of Healthway Medical Group Pte Ltd on 10 July 2016 at 4.38 a.m. at Central Police Station. The medical report dated 20 July 2016 (Exhibit P15) stated that Ryan claimed to have right shoulder and back pain and that his back pain was caused by the assault. Dr Lee found a five cm by five cm area of multiple superficial abrasions over Ryan’s right shoulder, associated with tenderness. This was likely to be due to blows from a blunt object. He also found a one cm by one cm by 0.5 cm abrasion on Ryan’s right thigh, which was likely to be due to blows from a blunt object.

## Cause of death and injuries suffered by the deceased

36     Dr Paul Chui (PW14), a Senior Forensic Pathologist attached to the Forensic Medicine Division, Health Science Authority conducted a _post-mortem_ examination on the deceased. He certified the cause of death in the autopsy report (Exhibit P11) as _traumatic asphyxia with head injury_.

37     He explained in his clarification report dated 25 October 2016 (Exhibit P12) that traumatic asphyxia occurs when the chest is severely compressed resulting in restricted respiratory movements and increased intrathoracic pressure. This would cause severe venous congestion and compromise to cardiac function.[^24] He further clarified in his report dated 5 December 2018 (Exhibit P13) that compression of the upper back can lead to restricted chest movements and development of traumatic asphyxia.

38     Dr Chui testified that the head injury did not contribute to the traumatic asphyxia and death. He explained that this was included in the certified cause of death as the head injury would have made it difficult for a person (in the deceased’s situation) to extricate himself as he would not have been able to function effectively or cogently to handle the situation.[^25]

39     Dr Chui also found four skeletal injuries present. These were:-[^26]

> (a)     Small crack fracture, medial wall of right orbit (“the first fracture”);

> (b)     Small crack fracture over right orbital roof (“the second fracture”);

> (c)     Fracture of nasal bones straddling the nasal bridge (collectively “the third fracture”); and

> (d)     Depressed fracture over the right frontal skull (“the fourth fracture”).

40     In Exhibit P13, Dr Chui stated that the second and fourth fractures could have resulted from the deceased’s right forehead impacting the staircase during the fall. He also clarified that the first and third fractures (which are the fractures specified in the charge against Lawrence) could have resulted from punching to the face or from a forceful impact onto the floor.

41     Apart from these injuries, the deceased suffered many other injuries which were documented in the autopsy report (Exhibit P11). These consisted of:-

> (a)     twelve bruises and abrasions to his head area;

> (b)     six injuries to his torso area which consisted of bruises, abrasions and haemorrhages;

> (c)     ten injuries to his upper limbs consisting of bruises and abrasions; and

> (d)     five injuries to his lower limbs which consisted of bruises and abrasions.

## Preliminary issue on charge against Ryan

42     I will first deal with the issue of whether the charge against Ryan was defective. Section 322 of the Penal Code (“PC”) provides:-

> 322.  Whoever voluntarily causes hurt, if the hurt which he intends to cause or knows himself to be likely to cause is grievous hurt, and if the hurt which he causes is grievous hurt, is said “voluntarily to cause grievous hurt”.

> Explanation.—A person is not said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt except when he both causes grievous hurt and intends or knows himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt. **But he is said voluntarily to cause grievous hurt if, intending or knowing himself to be likely to cause grievous hurt of one kind, he actually causes grievous hurt of another kind.** (emphasis added)

>> Illustration

> A, intending or knowing himself to be likely permanently to disfigure Z’s face, gives Z a blow which does not permanently disfigure Z’s face but which causes Z to suffer severe bodily pain for the space of 20 days. A has voluntarily caused grievous hurt.

43      _Grievous hurt_ is defined in s 320 of the PC. Ten types of hurt are designated as _grievous_. These include fracture of a bone, any hurt which endangers life, and death.[^27]

44     In proving its case, the prosecution sought to rely on the _explanation_ in s 322 of the PC. Its case theory was that Ryan knew that his assault was likely to cause grievous hurt of one kind i.e. fractures and/or hurt which endangered the deceased’s life, but that he actually caused grievous hurt of another kind i.e. death.[^28] By reason of the _explanation_, he would be liable for causing death.

45     Mr Peter Low, who acted for Ryan, belatedly challenged the propriety of the charge in the _Reply Submissions_. He contended that the charge was defective as it did not refer to fractures and endangerment of life which the prosecution relied on. Further, _traumatic asphyxia with head injury_ was not one of the ten types of grievous hurt specified in s 320 of the PC. The prosecution had also ignored and departed from the charge in its final submissions.

46     From a plain reading, the charge specified all the acts the prosecution intended to prove i.e. that Ryan stomped on the deceased’s shoulder, punched his face and head multiple times, forcefully pushed his face to the ground, and pressed his knee on the deceased’s back for about 20 minutes (“the acts”). The charge unequivocally specified the type of grievous hurt as death. There was no ambiguity as it did not refer to any other form of grievous hurt. As death had resulted, it was also proper to specify the cause of death i.e. _traumatic asphyxia with head injury_, although this is not one of the types of grievous hurt designated in s 320 of the PC. I was therefore of the view that the charge was not defective as it was framed with sufficient clarity and certainty for the accused to know what he was charged with and to answer the charge.

47     If the defence had appreciated the effect of the _explanation_ at s 322 of the PC, it may not have (as it claimed) been caught by surprise. During the course of trial, the prosecution stated that it was relying on fractures and endangerment of life, and that it was not necessary to show an intention to cause the specific injury contained in the charge, which was death.[^29] Further, it was put to Ryan that he knew that his assault was likely to cause fractures and endanger the deceased’s life.[^30]

## Evaluation of evidence (Ryan’s charge)

### Ryan caused grievous hurt to the deceased

48     While Ryan admitted to assaulting the deceased in the manner stated in his charge, the defence contended that none of Ryan’s acts caused grievous hurt.[^31] This submission was unmeritorious. The evidence established that Ryan caused the first and third fractures, endangered the deceased’s life, and caused his death. These are all forms of grievous hurt.

#### Ryan caused the first and third fractures when he smashed or forcefully pushed the deceased’s face to the floor

49     As stated at \[39\], the deceased suffered four fractures to his face. From Dr Paul Chui’s evidence, it was likely that the depressed fracture over the right frontal skull (the fourth fracture) and the related small crack fracture over the right orbital roof (the second fracture) were caused when the deceased’s face hit the railing or corner of the staircase when he fell down the stairs.[^32] These two fractures have no bearing on any of the charges.

50     The other two fractures were fractures of the nasal bones straddling the nasal bridge (the third fracture) and a small crack fracture at the medial wall of the right orbit (the first fracture). Dr Chui testified that it was possible that these fractures could have been caused if the deceased’s nose had made an impact with the steps or the railings of the staircase.[^33] The defence therefore jointly contended that these injuries could have occurred when the deceased fell down the stairs and not because of the later assault by Ryan. However, given the factual matrix, I was satisfied that these fractures occurred when Ryan smashed or forcefully pushed the deceased’s face onto the floor.

51     Ryan admitted to police officers at the scene that he smashed the deceased’s head and nose onto the floor.[^34] He stated in Exhibit P17 that after he pushed the deceased’s head hard onto the floor, he noticed blood on the floor and that the deceased’s nose was bleeding.[^35] He also admitted in cross-examination that when he pushed the deceased’s head hard onto the floor, he heard a crack sound. Thereafter, he saw bleeding from the deceased’s nose.[^36]

52     Dr Chui testified that if there had been no bleeding prior to these events, and if bleeding occurred subsequent to the application of force, the bleeding could be linked to the fracture of the nasal bones and the application of force.[^37] As bleeding only occurred after Ryan smashed or forcefully pushed the deceased’s face to the floor, the first and third fractures were, in all likelihood, caused at that time. I therefore rejected the joint contention of the accused persons that the injuries could have been caused when the deceased fell down the stairs.

#### Ryan endangered the deceased’s life and caused his death

53     I also found that by kneeling on the deceased’s upper back, Ryan had endangered the deceased’s life and caused his death. This was apparent from Dr Paul Chui’s evidence (\[36\]-\[38\] herein). He explained that the compression of the upper back could lead to restricted chest movements and the development of traumatic asphyxia. In the present case, there was no doubt that by kneeling on the deceased’s back, Ryan caused the traumatic asphyxia which led to the deceased’s death.

### Ryan possessed the requisite Mens Rea

54     The live issue at trial was whether Ryan possessed the requisite _mens rea_ to be guilty of the offence he was charged with. This would involve a subjective inquiry into Ryan’s state of mind. In _Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 116</span>, Sundaresh Menon, CJ stated at \[42\]:-

> Thus, the mental element required for an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt is that the accused actually intended grievous hurt to result from his actions or knew that it was likely that grievous hurt would so result. The inquiry is as to the accused person's subjective state of mind.

55     In determining a person’s subjective state of mind, his intention and knowledge may be inferred from his conduct and all the surrounding circumstances. The Chief Justice stated at \[42\]:-

> … As the Court of Appeal held in _Tan Joo Cheng v Public Prosecutor_ \[I9921 1 SLR(R) 2 19 at \[12\], intention (and to my mind, knowledge as well) is "pre-eminently a matter for inference". The same point was made by V K Rajah JA in _Lee Chez Kee_ at \[254\]:

>> Very often, it will not be the case that the accused states that he had a particular state of knowledge. The existence of a state of knowledge is therefore to be carefully inferred from the surrounding evidence. This is not to say that the courts should "objectivise" subjective knowledge with what they think the accused ought to have known; what this simply requires is for a careful evaluation of the evidence to disclose what the accused actually knew but had not stated explicitly. Indeed, this is the entire nature of circumstantial evidence.

56     The Chief Justice further explained at \[44\] as to how the inquiry on the accused person’s actual knowledge may be undertaken:-

> 44    It is thus open to, and often useful for, the court to undertake the inquiry into the accused's actual knowledge by a consideration of the objective circumstances and with reference to what a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have known. As explained in _Masoud Rahimi bin Mehrzad v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ \[2017\] _1_ SLR 257, in relation to the accused's knowledge of the nature of the drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), the reasonable person's perspective is "one of the evidential tools for the court to assess the accused's subjective state of mind" (at \[59\]). I consider that the same principles apply in the context of s 322. **Practically speaking, therefore, if it is shown that a reasonable person in the accused's position, having regard to all the facts and circumstances before him, would have known that grievous hurt was likely to result from his acts, then in order for the accused to deny actual knowledge, he would have to prove or explain how and why he** **_did not in fact_** **have such knowledge as the reasonable person would have had.** (emphasis added)

57     Ryan denied knowing that his acts were likely to cause fractures to the deceased’s face or endanger his life.[^38] The issue of whether he subjectively knew that his assault was likely to result in grievous hurt was to be inferred from the surrounding facts and circumstances.

#### Ryan intended to assault the deceased

58     When the deceased’s appeared at 7.00 p.m., Ryan messaged Irene. During the exchange, Ryan told her that he wanted to whack the deceased.[^39] When the deceased returned later, Ryan chased him down the corridor and assaulted him. He admitted that he was angry and that he wanted to beat up the deceased to teach him a lesson.[^40] He had all along intended to assault the deceased.

#### Smashing or pushing the deceased’s face forcefully to the floor was likely to result in fractures

59     After he assaulted the deceased, Ryan spoke to Sgt Lim Jun He (PW2), who arrived at the scene. Their conversation was recorded on Sgt Lim’s body worn camera. From the transcript of the audio recording (Exhibit P21), Ryan informed Sgt Lim that he had “smashed” the deceased’s head and nose onto the floor and that the deceased’s nose cracked:-

>   
| 

M1 \[Sgt Lim\]:

 | 

Okay, why was he injured to this extent?

 |
| 

M2 \[Ryan\]:

 | 

Because I smash his head, nose, smash the floor.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

M1 \[Sgt Lim\]:

 | 

So he has so much blood because his nose was hit

 |
| 

M2 \[Ryan\]:

 | 

The nose, nose crack

 |

  
  

60     Ryan later moderated his description of the incident and stated in Exhibit P16 that he had “pushed \[the deceased’s\] head hard to the floor”. He re-iterated in Exhibit P17 that he “pushed the back of \[the deceased’s\] head hard to the floor.” Crucially, Ryan admitted in Exhibit P16 that he had used excessive force on the deceased.[^41]

61     It would be reasonable to expect a person in Ryan’s position to know that when the victim’s head is smashed or forcefully pushed face down onto the floor, fractures to the face were likely to result. Ryan’s exchange with Sgt Lim showed that he possessed actual knowledge that his assault could lead to fractures. He was able to tell Sgt Lim that the deceased’s nose was cracked, even though no medical diagnosis had been made. Ryan was therefore untruthful in his claim that he did not know that his assault was likely to lead to fractures.

#### Ryan knew that he had endangered the deceased’s life when he caused the first and third fractures

62     The objective evidence showed that Ryan knew that he had endangered the deceased’s life when he caused the first and third fractures. He tilted the deceased’s head to the left to prevent him from drowning in his blood.[^42] He stated in cross-examination that:-[^43]

> Q    Okay. And then, it was only after you smashed the face, heard the crack sound then you noticed blood, right?

> A    Correct.

> Q    And in fact, after you smashed the deceased’s face you thought of that it was possible that the deceased could drown in his blood, right?

> A    Correct.

> Q    And when you meant “drowning” you meant that you thought of the possibility that the blood could flow into his lungs, is it?

> A    Uh, I mean, because he was facing down, I’m afraid that the blood would basically it’s either obstruct him from breathing or---or being choked.

> Q    Okay.

> A    So, that’s why I tilted his head.

> Q    I see, okay. So, basically, you it came to your mind that there’s a chance that the deceased couldn’t breathe properly, right?

> A    Correct.

63     This exchange proved that Ryan knew that he had put the deceased’s life in danger by causing the fractures. While he took steps to prevent the deceased from choking on his own blood, Ryan continued to endanger the deceased’s life by kneeling on him.

#### Ryan knew that he had endangered the deceased’s life and checked for signs of life

64     The attack on the deceased was prolonged and savage. It endangered the deceased’s life. Although the deceased was effectively immobilized, Ryan punched the back his head and smashed or forcefully pushed his face onto the floor. Ryan continued to rein punches on the back of the deceased’s head even after the police were called.

65     Ryan knew that by pressing his knee to the deceased’s back, he would be compressing or constricting the deceased’s chest. When he felt the deceased trying to struggle or move, he added more pressure with his knee,[^44] so that the deceased would stop moving. Ryan agreed that it could be inferred that his acts led to the deceased becoming weaker and weaker.[^45] Yet he continued kneeling on the deceased’s back until the police arrived. In so doing, he knew that he was likely to endanger the deceased’s life.

66     The objective and undisputed evidence showed that Ryan was acutely aware that he had endangered the deceased’s life. Significantly, when the police arrived, Ryan checked the deceased’s neck for a pulse “… to make sure he is alive.”[^46] He was thus concerned that he may have killed the deceased. I therefore rejected Ryan’s claim that he did not know that his assault posed life threatening issues to the deceased.[^47] The only conclusion that could be drawn was that Ryan knew that he had endangered the deceased’s life.

#### Intention to detain the deceased and hand him over to the police was not a defence

67     Ryan claimed that his intention was to detain the deceased and hand him over to the police. It was doubtful that this was his sole intention. He informed Irene that he wanted to whack the deceased. He wanted to teach the deceased a lesson. He ignored Irene’s advice to call the police if the deceased returned.

68     Even if Ryan’s sole intention was to detain the deceased and hand him over to the police, this did not amount to a plausible defence. The defence failed to establish any basis which entitled Ryan to detain the deceased or which justified the use of any kind of force. It was ambiguous as to whether Ryan was purporting to arrest the deceased and if so, how this right arose. Even if Ryan was entitled to detain or arrest the deceased with the use of force, this could not extend to the use of excessive force.

### Finding of guilt (Ryan’s charge)

69     For the reasons stated above, the irresistible inference was that Ryan knew himself likely to cause grievous hurt in the form of fractures or hurt which endangered the deceased’s life when he assaulted the deceased. His assault led to the death of the deceased, another form of grievous hurt. By reason of the _explanation_ in s 322 of the PC, Ryan voluntarily caused the grievous hurt stated in the charge i.e. death.

70     On the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving the charge against Ryan beyond a reasonable doubt. He was therefore found guilty and convicted as charged.

71     As an addendum, the charges against Ryan and Lawrence state the location of the offences as the “5th floor staircase landing”. In retrospect, it appears that the incident occurred at the sixth-floor staircase landing, since the unit is located on that floor. Although both charges may be erroneous, no prejudice was caused, since the location of the incident was not in dispute.

## Evaluation of evidence (Lawrence’s charge)

### Lawrence’s evidence

72     Lawrence testified that he felt very irritated and raised his voice when the deceased paid his last visit to the unit. The deceased moved away upon seeing Ryan. When Ryan chased after the deceased, Lawrence stood at the gate of the unit for a while. He saw Ryan and the deceased scuffling at the end of the corridor. He felt that Ryan might be in some danger as he was smaller than the deceased. Lawrence then walked as fast as he could towards them, intending to restrain the deceased and hand him over to the police.[^48]

73     When he reached the scene, both Ryan and the deceased were already on the floor. He could not remember what Ryan was doing but his guess was that Ryan was trying to restrain the deceased. Instinctively, he sat on the deceased’s buttocks (facing backwards) to prevent the deceased from running. Lawrence then caught hold of the deceased’s ankles. As the deceased was struggling, Lawrence instinctively crossed the deceased’s ankles and pulled them back, so that the deceased could not move. He had seen this type of leg lock in the movie called _Here Comes the Boom._ He estimated that he sat on the deceased’s buttocks for about 15 minutes.[^49]

74     Lawrence testified that all this time, Ryan was behind him. He could not see what Ryan was doing as he was focussed on restraining the deceased and did not turn around. However, he heard beating or punching sounds as well as groaning. He also heard Ryan ask the deceased, “Why he molest my mother”, “Why did you strangle my neighbour? Any why did you beat Ah Mah…”[^50]

75     Lawrence testified that initially, the deceased struggled quite a lot but subsequently stopped struggling. He then relaxed his hold on the deceased’s legs, after which the deceased did not struggle. The police then arrived.[^51]

### Abetment

76     The definition of abetment is contained in s 107 of the PC:-

> 107.  A person abets the doing of a thing who —

>> \[(a) and (b) are not relevant\]

>> (c)    intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.

>> …

>> Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.

77     The elements of abetment by intentionally aiding an offence were explained in _Public Prosecutor v Koh Peng Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 753</span> (_“Koh Peng Kiat”_) where the Court of Appeal stated at \[22\]:-

> 22    As for what the Prosecution must prove against a person charged with abetment by intentionally aiding, the elements were summarised by this court in _Bachoo Mohan Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 137</span> as follows (at \[111\]): In order to establish that abetment has taken place, the Prosecution must show that: _(a)the accused did something which facilitated the commission of offence (see Explanation2 to s107 (at\[110\] above)); and (b)the accused had knowledge of the circumstances of the offence_ (see _Daw Aye Aye Mu v PP_ \[1998\] 1SLR(R) 175 at\[41\] and _Pritam Singh s/o Gurmukh Singh v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 160</span> at\[33\]). Nelsonian knowledge or wilful blindness may also suffice for the purposes of establishing abetment liability (see _Bala Murugan a/l Krishnan v PP_ \[2002\] 2SLR(R) 420 at \[31\]). In _Chiaw Wai Oon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 233</span>, Yong CJ explained the difference between Nelsonian knowledge and lower standards of imputed knowledge in the following manner (at \[45\]):

>> \[M\]erely being put on inquiry or a mere suspicion is not to be equated automatically with knowledge. However, where the facts obviously point to one result, and the accused must have appreciated it but shuts his eyes to the truth, then together with the other evidence adduced, this can form a very compelling part of the evidence to infer the requisite guilty knowledge.

78     The court concluded at \[24\]:-

> 24    In other words, the person who abets by intentionally aiding an offence under s 49(_c_) of the TMA must have done something which facilitated the commission of the offence, and he must also have done so intentionally and with knowledge of the circumstances constituting the crime.

79     In view of _Koh Peng Kiat_, the prosecution had to prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt:-

> (a)     Lawrence did something which facilitated the commission of the offence and he did so intentionally; and

> (b)     Lawrence had knowledge of the circumstances constituting the crime.

### Lawrence facilitated the commission of the offence

80     I was satisfied that Lawrence had facilitated the commission of the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by sitting on the deceased and putting a leg-lock on him. He intended to immobilize the deceased and successfully did so. He prevented the deceased from extricating himself from Ryan’s attack. This allowed Ryan to smash or forcefully push the deceased’s face onto the floor and cause the first and third fractures.

81     I did not accept the contention that when he immobilized the deceased, Lawrence did not possess the requisite intention and/or knowledge that he would aid Ryan and facilitate the assault on the deceased.[^52] Instead, I was satisfied that Lawrence had due knowledge of the circumstances constituting the crime and intended to facilitate the commission of the offence. The reasons for my findings appear below.

### Lawrence had knowledge of the circumstances constituting the crime and intended to facilitate the commission of the offence

#### Lawrence was prepared to use force from the start

82     Lawrence stated in cross-examination that, “The intention from the beginning was to detain or restrain” the deceased and hand him over to the police.[^53] He formed this intention when he stood at the gate to observe what the deceased and Ryan were doing.[^54] Thus, even at this early stage, Lawrence had contemplated restraining the deceased, which would involve the use of force.

83     The defence failed to establish that Lawrence had the right to detain or restrain the deceased or to use force on him.

#### Lawrence must have seen Ryan’s assault on the deceased

84     Lawrence was an evasive witness who downplayed what he saw or knew. He claimed to have seen next to nothing as he walked towards Ryan and the deceased. He claimed that he was not focussing on them. It was implausible that he only saw them scuffling when he was one or two feet away. Since he perceived that Ryan was in danger[^55] and was concerned about Ryan’s well-being, he must have continued to observe what was happening as he walked towards them.

85     Lawrence’s statements to the police showed that he was an untruthful witness. In Exhibit P18, he stated that at some point during the struggle, the deceased’s body was flipped so that he was facing downwards.[^56] He must therefore have witnessed Ryan flipping the deceased over. The undisputed evidence was that Ryan then stomped on the deceased’s shoulder twice and knelt on his back. As Lawrence had noticed the deceased being flipped over, he must also have noticed these subsequent events.

86     In Exhibit P19, Lawrence stated that when he arrived at the scene, Ryan was already restraining the deceased’s upper body. Ryan testified that when Lawrence approached, he had already “started to detain Shawn by having my knee on his back.”[^57] While this account may differ from that in Exhibit P18, Lawrence must have at the very least seen Ryan assault the deceased by kneeling on the deceased’s upper back. Having seen Ryan assault the deceased, Lawrence joined in.

#### Lawrence knew that the first set of punches caused hurt

87     When they pinned the deceased down, Ryan and Lawrence were just several centimetres apart. They were almost touching and Lawrence could sense that Ryan was there.[^58] When Ryan threw the first set of punches, Lawrence heard three to four punching noises and thought it was “most likely” that Ryan was punching the deceased. He conceded that he may have turned around.[^59] He heard the deceased groaning in pain from the punches.[^60]

88     Lawrence must have realized from the groans that the deceased had been hurt by Ryan’s punches. He must have known that there was a strong likelihood that Ryan had targeted the deceased’s head. He had seen Ryan kneeling on the deceased’s upper back. As compared to his body, the deceased’s head would be unobstructed and exposed. It would also be natural to target the head, as punches to the head would cause the most damage and pain. Lawrence would also have known that an attack on the deceased’s head could lead to serious injuries, including fractures to the face.

#### Lawrence’s lack of reaction indicated that he was complicit

89     Lawrence displayed a total lack of reaction even after he realised the deceased was injured by the first set of punches. He did not appear shocked or surprised when Ryan punched the deceased in the head. As a father figure,[^61] he failed to tell Ryan to stop his assault[^62] even after he heard the deceased groaning in pain. He did not check on the deceased’s well-being. Lawrence must also have known from the circumstances that another attack was inevitable and that the deceased could be seriously hurt.

90     Lawrence’s claim that he did not turn around to see what was going on was incredible. It was also unbelievable that Lawrence did not hear Ryan tearing up the pages of the deceased’s notebook. As they were in close proximity, Lawrence must have known that Ryan was still agitated and angry, and that a further assault was eminent.

#### Lawrence intended to facilitate the attack which caused grievous hurt

91     The first set of punches would have put Lawrence on notice that Ryan was capable of committing a vicious assault. It would be reasonable to expect Lawrence to have known that a further assault was virtually certain if he continued to restrain the deceased, and that serious injuries could result if Ryan targeted the deceased’s head.

92     The deceased suffered the first and third fractures when his head was smashed or forcefully pushed to floor, during which time he was restrained by Lawrence. Lawrence was evasive about what he saw and heard. He denied hearing a crack sound when Ryan smashed the deceased’s head to the ground. He testified that he “perhaps” heard the sound of the deceased groaning in pain.[^63] While he denied turning around to take a look, Lawrence conceded that if he had simply looked over his shoulder, he would have “logically speaking” been able to see the pool of blood from the deceased’s nose.

93     Lawrence’s lack of reaction to this second attack indicated that he had all along intended to facilitate an assault by Ryan. If he did not have such an intention, he would have put a stop to further attacks after the first set of punches landed. He should have got off the deceased instead of continuing to restrain him.

94     Lawrence remained complicit even after Ryan smashed the deceased’s head to the floor. He continued to restrain the deceased which facilitated Ryan’s third attack. His lack of reaction to the third attack provided further proof that Lawrence had all along intended to aid Ryan to assault the deceased.

#### Lawrence was not entitled to rely on the right to private defence

95     The defence contended that Lawrence acted to preserve the safety of his stepson Ryan. It was submitted that as the deceased was bigger and heavier than Ryan, Lawrence felt that the deceased could cause serious harm to Ryan.[^64] There were no merits to this submission.

96     Ryan was the aggressor and had chased the deceased down the corridor in order to assault him. Ryan had overpowered the deceased by flipping him over and kneeling on his back. As the deceased was facing downwards, he could not assault Ryan, nor could he escape. It was doubtful that Ryan was in any danger. There was therefore no reason for Lawrence to act to preserve Ryan’s safety. In this regard, I rejected the evidence on what was referred to as the “parapet incident”.

#### Ryan concocted the parapet incident

97     Ryan failed to testify on the parapet incident in his examination-in-chief. This alleged incident only came up when Ryan was led in cross-examination by Lawrence’s counsel. In my view, Ryan had concocted the incident.

98     Ryan alleged that during his struggle with the deceased, he climbed onto the deceased’s back and crossed his legs around the deceased’s waist. He tried to pull the deceased down to the floor, but the deceased moved backwards towards the parapet. The deceased then backed him several times into the parapet, which injured his back. Ryan then uncrossed his legs and pushed against the ledge. This caused the deceased to lean forward and both them ended up on their backs on the floor.[^65]

99     Ryan’s account was not corroborated by any evidence. The parapet incident was clearly an afterthought. Neither of the accused persons mentioned this alleged incident in their statements. It was difficult to see how this fitted with the narrative in their statements or their evidence in court. Lawrence’s attempt to rely on the parapet incident was mischievous since he could not even recall this incident when he testified. Even if this incident did occur, any danger Ryan faced was transient. He managed to quickly gain the upper hand and force the deceased onto the floor.

### Finding of guilt (Lawrence’s charge)

100    Having considered the evidence in totality, I found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving the charge against Lawrence beyond a reasonable doubt. He had intentionally facilitated the commission of the offence and had knowledge of the circumstances constituting the crime. No reasonable doubt existed in his favour. He was therefore found guilty and was convicted as charged.

## Sentence

101    For an offence punishable under s 325 of the PC, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 10 years and liability to a fine or to caning. The prescribed punishment for abetting an offence under s 325 of the PC is the same.

102    In sentencing the accused persons, the two-step process set out in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> (“BDB”) applied. In that case, Sundaresh Menon, CJ (delivering the grounds of decision of the court) stated at \[55\]:-

> 55.    In the light of the above review of the precedents, we turn to the sentencing approach to be taken in cases prosecuted under s 325 of the Penal Code. The primary sentencing objective in such cases is likely to be deterrence. Further, retribution may also be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted. In our judgment, we think that sentencing in such cases should be approached in a two-step process as follows:

>> (a)    First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

>> (b)    Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustments upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

103    Possible aggravating factors were identified at \[62\]. These were:-

> (a)     the extent of deliberation or premeditation;

> (b)     the manner and duration of the attack;

> (c)     the victim’s vulnerability;

> (d)     the use of any weapon;

> (e)     whether the attack was undertaken by a group;

> (f)     any relevant antecedents on the offender’s part; and

> (g)     any prior intervention by the authorities.

104    The court also set out typical mitigating factors in cases of prosecution under s 325 of the PC at \[71\]. These included:-

> (a)     the offender’s mental condition;

> (b)     the offender’s genuine remorse; and

> (c)     the offender’s personal financial or social problems.

### Ryan’s sentence

105    Ryan was 20 years old at the time of the offence and 24 years old when he was sentenced. The prosecution sought a sentence of five years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane. Counsel initially submitted for a short custodial sentence in his _plea-in-mitigation_ . However, in his _Submissions in Reply to Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions_ he belatedly changed his position and submitted for probation in view of Ryan’s age.

#### Probation was not a realistic sentencing option

106    I was not inclined to call for a pre-sentence report as probation was not a realistic sentencing option. While Ryan was 20 years old at the time of the offence, which suggested that rehabilitation could be the primary sentencing consideration, this was displaced by the need for deterrence and retribution, given the severity of the offence and the manner in which it was committed: _Ho Mei Xia Hannah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 211</span>. Ryan also exhibited a total lack of remorse which suggested that a rehabilitative approach was not appropriate as he was not prepared to accept wrongdoing.

#### Indicative starting point was eight years’ imprisonment

107    The first step in the sentencing process was to determine the indicative starting point of sentence. In _BDB_, the court stated at \[56\]:-

> … where the grievous hurt takes the form of death (as in the case of the first charge against the Respondent), the indicative starting point should be a term of imprisonment of around eight years, which is close to the maximum imprisonment term of ten years…

108    The parties agreed that the indicative starting point should be eight years’ imprisonment.[^66] I was also satisfied that this was the appropriate starting point. The next step would be to calibrate sentence upwards or downwards to take into account Ryan’s culpability and the presence of aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

#### Calibrating sentence

109    The attack on the deceased was aggravated as it was prolonged and savage. It lasted about 20 minutes. After kneeling on the deceased, Ryan gratuitously punched the deceased in his head multiple times and smashed the deceased’s face onto the floor, causing the facial fractures. In exercising his brand of vigilante justice, Ryan had targeted the deceased’s head (a vulnerable part) from behind. The deceased was pinned down and could not even defend himself from this cowardly attack. The fact that both Ryan and Lawrence jointly assaulted the deceased was a further aggravating factor.

110    The prosecution submitted that there was deliberation on Ryan’s part, since he informed Irene that he would whack the deceased if he returned. This was not a strong form of deliberation or premeditation since it was conditional on the deceased choosing to return. No weight was therefore placed on this factor. Related to this, I did not accept the contention by the defence that the offence occurred on the spur of the moment, since Ryan’s pre-conceived intention was to assault the deceased if he returned.

111    Relying on _Public Prosecutor v Bong Sim Suan Suzanna_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 20</span>, the prosecution urged the court to take into account the previous history of violence by Ryan on the deceased.[^67] In that case, the Court of Appeal held that psychological harm caused by repeated assaults on a domestic worker could be taken into account in sentencing the offender. In the present case, it did not appear that the deceased suffered any psychological harm, since he continued to harass the family after he was assaulted. No weight could be placed on this factor.

112    In sentencing Ryan, I considered the matters raised in the plea-in-mitigation. He was 20 years old when he committed the offence, which was his first offence involving violence. He was of relatively good character.[^68] He was forthright in his statements to the police and had co-operated in their investigations.

113    It was a strong mitigating factor that Ryan and his family were victims of repeated harassment by the deceased for about two years prior to his death. Although the defence did not tender any psychological or psychiatric report on Ryan, it was not difficult to see that the harassment had caused him distress.[^69]

114    As Ryan did not display any remorse, this was not a mitigating factor. Counsel informed the court that Ryan had initially intended to plead guilty, but proceeded to claim trial as the defence could not agree to the Statement of Facts.[^70] I did not see how this could be construed as a display of remorse. As counsel callously put it, “While Shawn’s harassment ceased, Ryan’s family is now troubled by the charges preferred against Ryan (and Lawrence) as well as their recent convictions on the said charges.”[^71]

115    Considering the aggravating and mitigating factors, it was appropriate to calibrate Ryan’s sentence downwards from the initial starting point of eight years’ imprisonment. This was recognised by the prosecution which submitted for a sentence of five years’ imprisonment. However, as I did not accept all the aggravating factors the prosecution relied on, a further downward calibration was warranted, and I sentenced Ryan to four years’ imprisonment.

116    The prosecution also submitted that eight strokes of the cane should be imposed. I did not think that this was warranted. Ryan was a victim of stalking. He was frustrated by the prolonged harassment and reacted to it. It was unfortunate that he resorted to using violence against his stalker. In view of the unique facts which were presented, I was not minded to impose caning.

### Lawrence’s sentence

117    In sentencing Lawrence, I assessed the indicative starting point to be 12 months’ imprisonment based on the injuries inflicted. The next step would be to calibrate sentence upwards or downwards to take into account his culpability and the presence of mitigating or aggravating factors.

118    As in Ryan’s case, I accepted that this was a case of vigilante justice. It was an aggravating factor that Lawrence had assisted in a prolonged and sustained assault. I did not consider any history of previous assaults on the deceased to be relevant since the deceased did not appear to be affected.

119    In considering the plea-in-mitigation, I noted that Lawrence had no antecedents and that he had co-operated with the police. It was a strong mitigating factor that Lawrence and his family had been subjected to harassment by the deceased for an extended period. However, he displayed no remorse.

120    Counsel had submitted that because of the deceased’s egregious conduct, sentence should be “at least 6 to 12 months” imprisonment.[^72] In view of the mitigating factors, I calibrated sentence downwards to eight months’ imprisonment. This was within the range proposed by counsel and cannot be said to be manifestly excessive.
