### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## Introduction

1       Mr Eswaran S/O Rajasevran, a Singaporean, aged 38 claimed trial to a single charge of failing to provide a urine specimen contrary to section 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) (‘MDA’) and punishable under section 33A(1) of the Act.

> The charge reads:

>> are charged that you, **on the 8th of May 2018**, in Ang Mo Kio Police Division, did without reasonable excuse, fail to provide a specimen of your urine for urine test as required by a Narcotics Officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau, namely Staff SGT Lim Kai Siang, and thereby committed an offence under Section 31(2)[^1] of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185

> and further

>> that you, before the commission of the said offence, on **15th December 2009** pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under Section 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, had been admitted to an approved institution, namely**, Changi Prison/ Drug Rehabilitation Centre** for consumption of **Cannabis**, a Specified Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and on **15th January 2015** pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore

>> under Section 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, had been admitted to an approved institution, namely**, Changi Prison/ Drug Rehabilitation Centre** for consumption of **Cannabinol Derivatives and Nimetazepam**, Specified Drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, which admissions have not been set aside and you are now liable to be punished under Section 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185.

> \[Emphasis in the original\]

2       As can be seen, Mr Eswaran had logged no fewer than two DRC admissions (on 15 December 2009 and 15 January 2015) and is thus, by law, liable to a mandatory minimum term of five years’ imprisonment and caning of not less than 3 strokes

### Brief overview of the factual matrix

3       As charged _vide_ DAC-916292-2018, Mr Eswaran **_never_** provided a urine specimen when properly required to do so under the MDA on 8 May 2018, by CNB staff sergeant Lim Kai Siang, while he was remanded in CNB/police custody at Ang Mo Kio police division but contended that he had a reasonable excuse for his failure.

4       Mr Eswaran’s claim was that he was inhibited from providing urine, as he was suffering from self-described abdominal problems. These grounds will explore the validity of his reasons. It should also be noted that Mr Eswaran **_did_** urinate in the course of his custody, while defecating, but his urine had not been collected.

5       There is no real question of any lack of probable cause[^2] given the antecedent background history of Mr Eswaran and his girlfriend having been placed under arrest by CNB officers on 8 May 2018 outside Cameron Hotel, situated at Upper Changi Road, on suspicion of their having consumed and being in possession of controlled drugs. Drugs and items of drug taking apparatus were seized from a car registered to Mr Eswaran’s girlfriend[^3] SLA8363C) and also a room at Cameron Hotel which Mr Eswaran was staying. After a further check on the car, Mr Eswaran was brought to the CNB Office at Ang Mo Kio police division, where he was between 3.00 pm and 5.15 pm asked by an officer SSG Clinton Lim on no fewer than six occasions to provide a urine specimen.

6       During this period, Officer Lim testified that Mr Eswaran had been offered water on multiple occasions but had declined to take any drink. At about 3.30 pm, Officer Lim had administered a warning to Mr Eswaran of the consequence of his failing to provide a urine specimen. Mr Eswaran was asked to acknowledge this but declined to sign on the Station Diary.

7       At 5 .15 pm, Mr Eswaran informed Officer Lim that he was experiencing an episode of diarrhoea and wished to go to the toilet. According to his testimony, Officer Lim again asked Mr Eswaran to provide his urine specimen and invited him to choose two red bottles from a box containing a number of similar bottles. Mr Eswaran was noted to refuse to comply. Officer Lim and another officer Staff Sergeant Jagan S/O Ganasekaran (Officer Jagan) then escorted Mr Eswaran to the toilet. While he was there, Mr Eswaran was seen to defecate **_and also urinate_** into the toilet bowl. This critical event of urination was seen by both Officer Jagan and Officer Lim. Mr Eswaran was also noted to refuse to sign on the Station Diary pertaining to logging an instance the instance at 5.15 pm where officer Lim had asked for a urine sample, Mr Eswaran declined to acknowledge the same.

8       Mr Eswaran was then sent to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) later that day (8 May 2018) between 7.00 to 8.00 pm to undergo a medical evaluation to address his complaint of abdominal pain. Mr Eswaran was registered to KTPH at 7.45 pm. He examined by a medical doctor. Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim (PW4), at the Accident & Emergency Department at 9.00 pm. Pursuant to this examination, Dr Lim had on 9 May 2018, at 2.00 am rendered a medical memorandum (Exhibit P6) which certified Mr Eswaran as being “_able to pass urine with no difficulty_” at the material time.

9       On 9 May 2018, Mr Eswaran was transferred from KTPH to Changi General Hospital (CGH), where he was admitted for the duration of 9 May to 10 May 2018. At CGH, Mr Eswaran was examined by Dr Foo Mang Yik (PW5). After examining Mr Eswaran and reviewing the computed tomography scan which had been performed at KTPH, but made available to CGH vide the National Electronic Health Records (or NEHR) network, Dr Foo expressed the view that Mr Eswaran’s “_condition (ie abdominal pain and constipation) did not impede his ability to urinate_” and that records from CGH he had perused showed Mr Eswaran “_was able to pass urine throughout the whole admission without any issues_”.

### Summary of accused’s explanation for failure to provide a specimen

10     Mr Eswaran stood as the sole witness to his case, and upon his allocution being given, indicated his wish to give evidence on his own behalf, Mr Eswaran’s principal assertion was that he had suffered an intense episode of abdominal pain and diarrhoea on 8 May 2018, which had caused so much pain as to cause him to be unable to urinate. Mr Eswaran timed the onset of problems **_at 4.00 pm_** when his stomach was allegedly churning. This had exacerbated and by 4.30pm. his “stomach had a terrible pain”. This had led to the _sequelae_ where he had rushed to a female toilet in the premises, where he had defecated watery stools and also urinated.

### Detailed accounts of testimonies of salient witnesses

11     Having sketched out the broad overview above, I will now go into a more detailed description of the testimonial and documentary evidence, and their interconnections within the factual matrix of this case in a chronological order of events.

### Items found at arrest: Evidence of PW1; Jagan Ganasekaran

12     Officer Jagan Ganasekaran gave an account of the raid, where items of interest had been found, which had led to a suspicion of drug-related activities being conducted. Officer Jagan’s report (P2) gave a detailed rendition of the sequence of events. I have set out a lightly paraphrased version of P2, with editing to declutter the content of details not salient to this case (NRIC numbers and postal codes), to promote readability and flow:

> On 8 August 2018 at about 1047 am, a party of officers led by Senior Staff Sergeant Lim Kai Siang conducted a hotel visit at 393F Upper Changi Road, Cameron Hotel to look for B1; Ms Indumathi Kunasegaran. Ms Indumathi was standing outside with her boyfriend Mr Eswaran Rajasevran. Both subjects were placed under arrest.

> A search was conducted inside Room number 32 if the hotel here subject was believed to be staying. From the table top, a _Nitchi_ metal container was found to contain a brownish substance wrapped in newspaper. **_Also at the table top, an improvised smoking instrument with a blue straw attached was found._** There was also a blue _Pall Mall_ cigarette box containing a ‘crystallized’[^4] substance, which was suspected to be controlled drugs at the bed side. Ms Indumathi was found to be driving a Mazda car. Officers were led to the car SLA 8363C by Mr Eswaran. A search was conducted inside the car. From the glove compartment, a packet of crystallized substance believed to be controlled drugs was found inside a black box. Within the centre console compartment of the vehicle, within a _Shengfa_ phone box, another Marlboro box containing a ‘crystallized’ substance was found, along with a small packet of brownish substance and a small weighing scale[^5]. Subsequently the party of officers left the hotel with both Ms Indumathi and Mr Eswaran.

> At 2.10 pm, Ms Indumathi’s car was subject to a backscatter check at Woodlands Checkpoint. During the backscatter, **_Mr Eswaran attempted to injure himself by knocking himself against the wall_**. The backscatter ended at 2.22 pm with nothing (else) incriminating found. \[Emphasis added\]

### Evidence on attempts to procure a urine specimen from the accused

13     Given the presence of suspected narcotics and also of implements for the administration of such drugs, CNB officers sought to obtain a urine sample from Mr Eswaran to assess if he had indeed consumed narcotic drugs. On the prosecution’s case that Mr Eswaran had refused to provide his urine specimen despite repeated requests and being warned of the consequences of his failure, the testimonial and documentary evidence are corroborative to show Mr Eswaran’s apparent non-cooperation **_even before_** the onset of his claimed stomach problems at 4.00 pm. The officers at the scene were PW 1; Officer Jagan, PW2; CNB Sergeanr Muhammad Amirrudin Bin Tokuman, and PW3; Senior Staff Sergeant Clinton Lim Kai Siang.

### Urine collection process

14     PW1 Officer Jegan described[^6] the urine collection process and indicated that the this was prefaced by ascertaining that the suspect could produce urine. The suspect would be invited to drink water if he could not provide the requisite urine sample. If, however, the subject was in a position to provide his urine sample, he would be asked to select a **_red_** master bottle from a box containing a collection of master bottles. He would then be asked to urinate into his selected master bottle. The administering officers would then ascertain if enough urine had been collected for the purpose of the test. The suspect would then be used to make a further selection of two smaller bottles, from which urine would be drawn and the samples sent to the Health Sciences Authority’s Illicit Drug Laboratory for testing. The balance urine which remained in the red master bottle would be tested on the spot for a provisional analysis for the presence of controlled drugs.

15     The prosecution’s case if of course premised on Mr Eswaran, despite his episode of witnessed (and indeed admitted) urination, never providing a sample in the manner stipulated. The focus will thus be on the sequence of events which occurred in the afternoon and evening of 8 May 2018, both before and after his urination, and transportation to hospital.

### Evidence of PW3 Officer Clinton Lim

16     Even though PW1 was present, an essential part of the evidence would come from PW3; as Officer Clinton Lim was the documentarian[^7] of the interactions between Mr Eswaran and the CNB officers at the scene that afternoon. The records begin with Officer Lim specifically calling on Mr Eswaran to provide his urine specimen. Mr Eswaran indicated that he was unable to provide a urine sample, Officer Lim accordingly states

> 01\. 1500 hours. Subject Eswaran s/o Rajasevran, (IC number). Subject was brought back to Ang Mo Kio CNB office, he was asked to give urine and he informed that he is unable to provide his urine sample.

### Accused’s continual refusal to drink

17     Officer Lim indicated that the facilities provided easy access to water as there was a water dispenser with paper cups near the accused. Mr Eswaran was explicitly asked to take a paper cup to take water to drink but had refused[^8]. Mr Eswaran was given a grace period of a half hour before Officer Lim administered a warning of the consequences attendant to Mr Eswaram’s continued non-compliance, which he had documented in the Station Diary at [^9]3.30 pm where he makes it quite plain that Mr Eswaran was liable to be “charged for failing to provide his urine specimen for testing”:

> 02 1530. Subject was warned that he could be charged for failing to provide his urine sample for testing. Subject is warned by Senior Staff Sergeant Clinton Lim.

### Instances where water had been offered to promote urination

18     Officer Lim indicated that Mr Eswaran had been offered water on no fewer than five occasions between 3.00 pm to 5.00 pm. Three of the instances had occurred at or before 4.00 pm when he claimed an onset of abdominal pains. For completeness, the calls to provide urine were made:

19     PW1; Officer Jagan had also been at the scene and had directly witnessed Mr Ewaran’s obdurate behaviour in claiming to be unable to provide urine for testing, and yet refusing all offers of water to facilitate urination[^15].

### Accused rushes to toilet and urinates while defecating

20     In their testimonial accounts, before this episode, Mr Eswaran appeared to have not articulated any gastrointestinal disturbance to Officer Lim, as there was no documentation of his suffering from the same in the Station Diary. Mr Eswaran had only made a request to go to the toilet to pass motion after Officer Lim yet again asked Mr Eswaran to provide his urine specimen for **_the sixth time_** at 5.15 pm.

21     Upon Mr Eswaran’s complaints of the onset of diarrheal symptoms, Officer Jagan and Officer Lim had had brought Mr Eswaran to the area next to the toilet which had a collection of designated bottles for Mr Eswaran to choose to provide his urine specimen into. Officer Lim had then asked Mr Eswaran to choose two red bottles from a box (with multiple bottles to facilitate the collection of Mr Eswaran’s urine specimen. Mr Eswaran had declined, and categorically told Officer Lim that he **_refused_** to give his urine sample stating in no uncertain terms that he did not want to give his urine sample[^16].

22     PW3 recounted the sequence of events when questioned by defence counsel on the sequence of events[^17] :

> PW3: Your Honour, on that day, the accused informed me that he has diarrhoea and he wished to pass motion. So, therefore, I told him, when he’s passing motion, can he also give his urine at the same time?

> … I escorted him to the area where there’s urine bottles which is just beside the toilet. He was asked to choose the urine bottles which he declined. After that **_he outright informed me that he refused to give his urine…_**

23     Notably, the fact of Mr Eswaran telling Officer Clinton Lim that “_I do not want to give my urine_” was not challenged during Officer Lim’s cross-examination and not denied when Mr Eswaran later testified.

24     Given the significance if the event, it would be _apropos_ to set out Officer Lim’s testimony in court in relation to the episode of the accused urinating while in the toilet[^18]:

>   
| 

PW3:

 | 

…Subject informed that he has diarrhoea and wished to use the toilet. He was asked to give his urine samples and he refused. He was asked to choose 2 red bottles from our box and he refused to comply. He was escorted to the toilet and he passted \[_sic_\] motion. Senior Staff Sergeant Clinton Lim Kai Siang and Staff Sergeant Jagan witnessed the subject urinating into the toilet bowl.[^19]

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How did you know that the accused urinated into the toilet bowl?

 |
| 

A :

 | 

Your Honour, **_after the accused passed motion, he stood up and he---and there was a stream of water coming out from his penis._**

 |
| 

Q

 | 

How long did that process took if you could briefly estimate?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Your Honour, **_I think it was about 15 to 20 seconds_**.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

25     Officer Lim recalled that he could tell that Mr Eswaran had indeed defecated as he was using a squat type toilet[^20]. He did not observe whether Mr Eswaran’s stools were normal or diarrheal[^21]. Officer Lim noted too that Mr Eswaran did not urinate while passing motion _“(b_)_ut he stood out to pee after he defecate(d)”[^22]_,

26     Officer Lim’s account is corroborated by Officer Jagan’s testimony where PW1 states[^23]:

> (Mr Eswaran) mentioned that he wants to go to the toilet because he has got diarrhoea and… while he was going to…to pass motion, we also asked him for his urine sample. but then he---he---he refused to comply and he did not want to choose a red bottle at that point of time to… provide his urine sample. So, we escorted him to the toilet and **_he actually urine_**(sic) **_at that point of time_**[^24].

27     The entire sequence is duly recorded in the Station Diary which states:

> _“Subject informed that he has diarrhoea and wish to use the toilet. He was asked to give his urine samples and he refused. He was asked to choose 2 red bottles from a box and he refused to comply. He was escorted to the toilet and he passed motion. SSS Clinton Lim Kai Siang and SSgt Jagan witness the subject urinating into the toilet bowl …_

> _Subject refused to sign.”_

### Post urination events

28     Officer Lim indicated that there seemed “_nothing out of the ordinary_”[^25] in Mr Eswaran’s physical state after he emerged from the toilet, He denied counsel’s suggestion at cross examination, that Mr Eswaran had “collapsed” in front of him, or that the accused had been vomiting or showing signs of nausea. Officer Lim indicated that Mr Eswaran had not been given a meal to that point of time PW3 also stated that “the station diary was stopped after the accused informed that he refused to give his urine”[^26].Mr Eswaran’s signalled his continued defiance in the following terms:

> A    (The accused) informed me verbally that he do (_sic_) not want to give his urine sample when he was asked to.

> Q    To the best of your knowledge, can you please use---can you please state the exact words that were used by the accused?

> A    Your Honour, **_the accused said, “I do not want to give my urine.”_**

> Q    And you confirm that those were the words said by the accused to the best of your memory?

> A    Yes, Your Honour.

### Conveyance to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital

29     Subsequently to the closure of the Station Dairy, Mr Eswaran was sent at around 7.00 pm in the evening of 8 May 2018 to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (**KTPH**), where his registration was completed at 7.45 pm. The purpose was to investigate the accused’s complaint that he had abdominal pain. Officers Lim and Jagan had accompanied Mr Eswaran. Upon arrival, Mr Eswaran had slept. He had then awakened and become “quite violent, threshing around and shouting”[^27] in the hospital premises. Mr Eswaran had to be restrained by the accompanying narcotics officers.

### Continued refusal to provide urine sample in hospital

30     PW 1; Officer Jagan described Mr Eswaran’s continued resistance at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in the following manner[^28].

> He was asked to provide his urine at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Sir, and …**_he still failed to provide his urine_** and then he was… escorted to the toilet of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital but then …**_when he came out from the toilet, he… started struggling_** and …so we were trying to hold him back like …to prevent any injury to anybody in the hospital.[^29] \[Emphasis added\]

31     Officer Jagan recalled being later told by medical personnel that Mr Eswaran had no problem providing his urine sample.

Medical evidence on salient aspects of Mr Eswaran’s condition at the material time

### Evidence of PW4 Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim

32     This critical aspect of the prosecution’s case against Mr Eswaran is provided by two medical doctors. The first was Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim (PW4), who had seen Mr Eswaran after his admission to KTPH at 7.45 pm on 8 May 2018. Dr Lim, who had three years’ experience, and an interest in Family Medicine, examined Mr Eswaran at the hospital’s Accident & Emergency Department at 9.00 pm. After her examination, Dr Lim stated her medical opinion in a report dated 9 May 2018 which states:

> This is a report regarding (Mr Eswaran Rajasevran) who presented to KTPH A&E with symptoms of abdominal pain.

> This memo is to certify that patient **_is able to pass urine with no difficulty_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

33     In this regard, Dr Lim explained that she had noted Mr Eswaran was merely expressing his symptoms of abdominal pain by “groaning” and it _“didn’t look like_ (the pain) _was excruciating”_. As Mr Eswaran did not present any other indicia of a clinical condition which would affect a person’s ability to urinate, her clinical assessment had been that the abdominal pain complained of “_probably would not have impeded his ability to urinate_”.[^30] Dr Lim also expressed her view that she “_did not think that there was anything wrong with_ (Mr Eswaran’s) _urinary system at that time”_ which would render him unable to pass urine[^31]

### Accused’s inability to identify area of abdominal pain

34     In her cross examination, Dr Lim had **_not_** found Mr Eswaran to be co-operative as he had merely stated that he suffered from abdominal pain and ‘refused’ to give doctors any relevant history to pursue their medical investigations[^32] The evidence showed that Mr Eswaran was oddly **_non-specific_** in relation to the nature and extent of his reported abdominal pain.

35     Dr Lim had, as per the usual procedure, palpated all nine quadrants of her patient’s abdomen _“just to elicit whereabouts is the most painful area”_. In Mr Eswaran’s instance, the accused persisted with his “_groaning and he didn’t exactly say there was a particular spot that was painful”[^33]._ When Dr Lim was questioned by the court, after the conclusion of the cross-examination and re-examination, the sheer extent of Mr Eswaran’s resistance to medical examination becomes all too obvious when Dr Lim states[^34]:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

You mentioned that (the accused) was uncooperative. Could you elaborate on what you mean by that?

 |
| 

Dr Lim:

 | 

So, the first time when we went to examine him…we asked the reason why he was here and, ... could he elaborate more on the abdominal pain. So, the only thing he told us that he was …currently having abdominal pain…**_did not want to elaborate more on what type of pain it was_** .., **_whereabouts was the pain_** and any other further symptoms. And, …**_not cooperative in examination meaning that when we wanted to check his neurological function, his power, his strength_** ,.. **_he did not want to cooperate_**…[^35] \[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

36     The only condition of note in her examination and evaluation of the accused with X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans, was the presence of **_colonic dilatation_**, which could have arisen from, another other causes, an inflammatory process. Dr Lim merely noted that a portion of the accused’s colon (or large intestine) seemed swollen from her reading of the _computed tomography: abdomen and pelvis_ (CTAB) scan. There were many causes of colonic dilatation and Dr Lim could **_not_** make any direct co-relation[^36] between the diarrhoea which Mr Eswaran had claimed to have, and the dilatation observed in that part of his gastrointestinal tract. Significantly, Dr Lim make it clear that complaints of abdominal pain were necessarily subjective, and thus the colonic dilatation seen did **_not_** establish that Mr Eswaran was indeed experiencing any abdominal pain at the time. Dr Lim indicated that her answer would be the same even with counsel’s suggested permutation that Mr Eswaran had been taking _Lactulose_ laxatives prior to his arrest[^37].

37     Dr Lim stated that as Mr Eswaran had, despite the administration of analgesia for pain relief, maintained his complain of abdominal pain, and had thus noted the accused’s “_ongoing abdominal pain”_ and decided to transfer Mr Eswaran to Changi General Hospital. Dr Lim had in her referral memorandum to Changi General Hospital[^38], made references to _“nausea”_ and “_vomiting_” as these were symptoms which were commonly associated with conditions which caused abdominal pain, and she had in an abundance of caution, listed these conditions for observation[^39], given the unidentified nature if the accused’s complaints. Dr Lim clarified that Mr Eswaran had never alluded to suffering from the same. there are many causes of colon dilatation. Dr Lim also could not point to any direct causal relationship between Mr Eswaran’s alleged diarrhoea and the dilatation observed[^40], as some patients with diarrhoea may not have like any dilatation of the colon. She could **_not_** tell, in these premises if the dilatation could be **_due_** to the diarrhoea or had **_caused_** the diarrhoea.

### Evidence of PW 5 Dr Foo Mang Yik

38     On 9 May 2018, Ms Eswaran was transferred from KTPH to Changi General Hospital (CGH), where he was warded from 9 to 10 May 2018. Dr Foo was a doctor of five years’ standing, and who planned to specialise in General Surgery, had examined Mr Eswaran and reviewed the computed tomography (CT) scans performed on the accused in KTPH[^41]and accordingly produced a medical report[^42] stating as follows:

> Mr. Eswaran Rajasevran, was admitted to Changi General Hospital from 9 to 10 May 2018 for 2 days history of central abdominal pain and constipation. He had a CT abdomen pelvis performed in KTPH which showed large dilated loops with air and fluid and a short calibre change at the retrosigmoid junction or upper rectum. Based on this(_sic_) CT scan findings, he underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy up to descending colon which revealed no obstructive lesions. He was subsequently able to defecate during this admission with the aid of laxatives,

> **_This condition did not impede his ability to urinate. Our records showed that he was able to pass urine throughout the whole admission without any issues. We were able to send his urine for drug screen which returned as positive for methamphetamines_**, I have attached a printout of the drug screen for your perusal.

> I would also like to clarify that the patient did not have any episodes of seizure during this admission. \[Emphasis added\]

### Reasons behind diagnosis of constipation

39     Dr Foo indicated that his statement of the accused’s condition in relation to Mr Eswaran’s two-day history of _“central abdominal pain and constipation”_ had arisen from the accused himself. I found Mr Eswaran’s latter complaint rather curious given the event at 5.15pm on 8 May 2018, had indeed involved, by the accused’s own admission, an episode of defecation. What is more cogent, however, is Dr Foo’s medical opinion that the stated conditions of abdominal pain and constipation **_ought not impede_** Mr Eswaran’s ability to urinate.

40     In his court testimony, Dr Foo went into considerable detail to explain his findings. Dr Foo indicated that after seeing the accused in CGH the mid-afternoon of 9 May 2018, a flexi-sigmoidoscopy has been performed as an additional investigative process to complement the CT scan done in KTPH, as there was no discernible cause to explain Mr Eswaran’s complaint of abdominal pain. The sigmoidoscopy revealed the presence of faecal matter within Mr Eswaran’s large bowel, or colon, “_which could potentially explain constipation”_[^43]. Laxatives were accordingly administered, as Dr Foo felt that this would “_tie in with his presenting complaint at KTPH”[^44]._ When the court later sought clarification whether the mere presence of faecal matter in the colon would suffice as a definitive indication of a patient suffering from constipation, Dr Foo’s response was “_No, we can’t tell. It’s based on what the patient tells us_”.[^45]

41     Simply put, while there appeared to be puzzling incongruities between the actual event of Mr Eswaran’s dramatic defecation incident while in CNB custody on 8 May 2018, and Dr Foo giving a diagnosis of “_constipation_” the very next day; on 9 May 2018, Dr Foo has made it clear that all treatments administered and scans interpreted (as in the inference of _“constipation”_ merely from the presence of non-excreted stools and a slight gaseous swelling of the accused’s colon) were premised on the **_assumption_** that Mr Eswaran’s specific complaints of abdominal pain and constipation were true. Mr Eswaran had, after all, claimed to have had _“constipation”_ for two days at the consultation with Dr Foo in the afternoon of 9 May 2020.

### Discovery of methamphetamine in samples of accused’s urine taken at CGH

42     Perhaps the most remarkable aspects of Dr Foo’s report would be firstly that Mr Eswaran was indeed able to urinate with ease, and secondly that a sample of his urine taken while the accused was warded in CGH had been analysed and found to be positive for the presence of _methamphetamine_. With regard to the first aspect, Dr Foo indicated that Mr Eswaran had never displayed any signs of being in acute urinary retention. Indeed he noted that seemed “_very comfortable”_ and never looked to be in any distress[^46]. Mr Eswaran’s urine had been collected into a sterile[^47] urine bottle sometime on 9 May 2018, with the collection conforming to the hospital’s protocol in avoiding contamination. Dr Foo indicated that Mr Eswaran had not been catheterised but had urinated normally into the sterile urine bottle. The urine sample had then been sent for testing at _NUH Referral Laboratories Pte Ltd_, where their report[^48] had been collected the next day; 10 May 2018 at 1.40 pm. The report which showed results across a panel of narcotics, benzodiazepines, sedatives and other psychoactive drugs, indicated a positive result for only _methamphetamine_, and negative for other drugs. Dr Foo explained that while the laboratory report did not show the actual concentration of _methamphetamine_ in Mr Eswaran’s urine, the quantum would necessarily **_exceed_** the stipulated cut-off of 1000 nanograms per millilitre of urine to generate a positive result[^49] for the presence of _methamphetamine_.

43     Mr Eswaran’s charge under section 31 of the MDA is not, of course, for the consumption of narcotic drugs _per se_, but rather for his failure to provide a specimen for testing, in the absence of any reasonable excuse, where he has been suspected of such consumption. The discovery of _methamphetamine_ in the sample taken while he was hospitalised, just a single day after his arrest is, nevertheless, extremely relevant toward a circumstantial inquiry of whether his failure to provide the sample was predicated upon a motive to conceal the fact of his prior illicit consumption of _methamphetamine_, and hence a deliberate act. The actual presence of _methamphetamine_ in his urine would inevitably aid the prosecution’s case in demonstrating that Mr Eswaran likely acted under such a motive. This would not be the end of the inquiry, however, since it would still be open to Mr Eswaran to make his case that he had a “reasonable excuse” in failing to render his urine sample for testing.

### Defence case

44     Counsel reasonably did not seek to assert that Mr Eswaran did not have a case to answer, and after the allocution was administered, Mr Eswaran elected to give evidence on his own behalf as the sole witness of his case.

### Accused’s personal history

45     Mr Eswaran, who is presently 38, stated that his highest educational attainment was a diploma in Safety, Health and Environment from the Singapore Human Resource Institute, which he had received in 2008. Before his remand which had commenced on 9 May 2018, he had worked as a workplace safety and health co-ordinator[^50] and earned a basic salary of $2800. This personal history, particularly his maturity in age, attainment of a professional technical qualification at an institute of higher learning, and steady gainful employment, was relevant for the court to gauge the rationality of his conduct, in relation to his understanding of the situation he was facing, at the material time.

46     Mr Eswaran identified the individual he had been arrested with; Ms Indumathi d/o Gunasegaran[^51], as his girlfriend and the mother of his child, who had been born in December 2018, while he was in remand. He informed that Ms Indumathi had been convicted on drug consumption charges and been sentenced to a term of five years’ imprisonment.

### Account of events before urine collection regime

47     The accused disavowed any ownership of the drugs and associated articles found in the hotel room and the Mazda car, stating that these had belonged to a certain ‘_Shankar s/o Sababadi’_[^52], whom Mr Eswaran recalled to have been convicted of drug possession offences and been sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment[^53].

### Request for, and provision of a meal at time of urine collection regime

48     Mr Eswaran’s account was that he had been given a meal and a drink before the urine collection began. After the search of the vehicle at Woodlands Checkpoint. Mr Eswaran asserted that[^54]

> “…first thing I requested for food because my girlfriend is pregnant, and she’s---she’d be hungry. I was very concerned about my child and all, so I asked for some lunch, and then lunch was provided. That’s the first thing I did when I reached the police station.”

49     Rather surprisingly, Mr Eswaran stated that his request had been acceded to and a lunch of _Briyani_ rice and a drink of Coke soda, had been provided at 3.00, which he had proceeded to eat at a fairly languorous pace, finishing lunch, in his words at ‘_I estimate at least 1530._’[^55]

50     Counsel pointed out to Mr Eswaran that the Station Diary had documented that the urine collection regime had started at 3.00pm. Mr Eswaran had doggedly insisted that he had been consuming his lunch then, and would have simply **_ignored_** the officers’ calls to give his sample[^56]:

> Q    Now, can you look at the first entrance[^57] of P4? 1500, “Eswaran Rajasevran, the subject was brought back to Ang Mo Kio CNB office, he was asked to give urine and he informed that he was unable to provide his urine sample.” You just testified that at 3:00, you’re already brought back to CNB office, right?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    Who asked you to give urine? As soon as you arrived in Ang Mo Kio, you were asked to give urine, who asked you?

> A     **_They---they told me to give urine, but I haven’t eat my lunch, so I---I was ea---still taking my lunch._**

> Q:    Mr. Eswaran, look at P4 very carefully before you answer. My question is, at 3:00, you were brought back to the CNB office, you said that you asked for lunch, but this particular entry states that you were asked to give urine and you informed that you are unable to provide the urine sample, so who asked you? Which is the person, who asked you to give the urine? Which officer?

> A:     **_I probably never tell anything to the officers that I cannot give urine or anything during the time._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

51     When asked about his response at 3.30 pm to the warning administered by officer Clinton Lim, Mr Eswaran’s response was the somewhat baffling ‘_I actually didn’t hear him saying that. I didn’t get to hear what he was trying to tell me_…’[^58] Mr Eswaran contended that he was not ready to give his urine sample, and repeatedly stated that he had never answered as he had not heard the warning. The accused also reiterated his belief that he would have ‘_more than sufficient time to provide urine… that’s why I just waited’. because my bladder is not ready also_’[^59](as he had just taken his lunch). Mr Eswaran insisted that he had already drunk some fluid (the Coke soda beverage) which had been served with his lunch[^60]:

> “I didn’t wanted _(sic_) to drink water because I just take my lunch. During my---eating my lunch, I eat and drink together. All provided by the police station.”

### Implausibility of lunch being provided against urine collection protocol and accused’s continued inaction

52     I would pause here to reflect on how implausible the scenario sketched by Mr Eswaran thus far appeared to me. Mr Eswaran had claimed to have been given a meal of _Briyani_ and Coke[^61] at 3.00pm that day, despite Officer Lim’s clear indication that **_no_** meals were provided to suspects who had not yet yielded their urine sample as this was contrary to protocol for good reason[^62]:

> “Usually, we do not give them anything to eat **_before_** they give their urine samples **_to prevent allegations that we put something in the food_** to cause---to give rise to their positive urine result’. \[Emphasis added\]

53     A variation of the situation posited by Officer Lim, that is to say; of suspects potentially using food and meals provided to concoct reasons to invalidate the testing regime, was in play here. While Mr Eswaran had not directly alleged a spiking, he was implicitly attributing the alleged _Briyani_ and Coke meal to have caused him to develop abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms, which prevented him from delivering the urine sample, where he would otherwise have been willing to provide.

54     Another aspect which beggared explanation was Mr Eswaran’s apparent insouciance in ignoring the officers’ calls to provide a urine sample as he was eating his lunch, and then refusing the offers to drink water as he had just taken his lunch, and that he had had somehow mentally ‘blocked’ Officer Lim’s warning of the consequences of his failure to provide urine.

55     The scenario seemed eminently implausible, given Mr Eswaran’s age, life experience, and his full awareness that persons he had associated with at Cameron Hotel; Mr Shanker and Ms Indumathi had been arrested for drug-related charges[^63]. The fact that he had also been present as a Mazda car that the trio had used, had been sent for a backscatter scan at Woodlands Checkpoint[^64] to trace the presence of illicitly stored drugs would have helped concentrate his mind as to the **_seriousness_** of the situation he as in, and make his lackadaisical stance of ignoring warnings and eschewing offers to drink highly unlikely.

### Onset of ‘abdominal problems’

56     This improbably placid state of affairs began to change at 4.00pm, when Ms Eswaran’s stomach began _‘churning’_, causing him to feel _“uncomfortable”_ and he _“didn’t wanted (_sic_) to drink the water”[^65]_ as a result_._ The accused asserted that “_If I drink that water…my stomach pain will_ (sic) _even worse”[^66]_ He also experienced pain and giddiness, and had become debilitated to the point the he became to be “_not able to concentrate”_[^67] on what was happening around him_._

57     By 4.30 pm, Mr Eswaran recalled, his condition has exacerbated to “_a terrible pain”_ and he held on to his stomach[^68]. He alleged that this pain caused him to be unable to “_concentrate on anything”_ or “_focus on what the officers were talking about”_.[^69] I found it surprising that it had not occurred to the accused that even if he could not focus on what the officers were _“talking about”_, he might extrapolate that they were still asking him to provide a urine sample, or to take some water to facilitate the same, as the officers had done since 3.00 pm. Rather tellingly, he conceded “_I never care on what they were talking about._”, albeit citing his gastrointestinal travails as a basis for his state of mind.

DPP:

 | 

I will now refer you to entry number 5 of exhibit P4. At 1630 hours, Senior Staff Sergeant Lim asked you to provide your urine sample. Agree, disagree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**_During that time, I could not concentrate on anything. Could not focus what they are talking about, so I never signed._** That’s the reason I did not sign, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

At 1600---1630 hours …water was offered to you. Agree, disagree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

As I said, **_I never care on what they are actually talking about because I was already---my stomach was churning and I was in pain_**…

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

58     At 5 pm, Mr Eswaran stated that he was experiencing nausea, and could not concentrate on what was happening. At that point he was handcuffed and sitting on a bench. He had then told the officers at the scene that he needed to see a doctor[^70]. On being asked by counsel to respond to the entry in the Station Diary that he was offered water and had declined, Mr Eswaran did not state his exact response to officers, but claimed it _“totally impossible for me to drink any water because my stomach was churning.”_ He also claimed to be experiencing pain and giddiness.

59     Curiously, while Mr Eswaran seemed able to communicate with the officers to stress his apparent need to see the doctor, he claimed not to be able to cognitively process what the officers were saying to him and thus did not “_hear_” or “_see what they were talking about”_, and did not drink as he was unable to understand that he was being asked to do that. This is an extract of Mr Eswaran’s evidence in that juncture to give a flavour of his evidence[^71]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

I now refer you to entry number 6 of exhibit P4. At 1700 hours, Senior Staff Sergeant Lim asked you to provide your urine sample. Agree, disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

During this time, around 5:00 I think I have already holding my stomach literally in pain, so **_I really didn’t hear what they are talking about_**, I was in bad pain, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

And at 1700 hours, you were offered water by CNB officers. Agree, disagree?

 |
| 

A

 | 

**_I just said I was holding my stomach, bend down and never even see what they are talking about_**, I was in bad pain.

 |
| 

_…_

 |
| 

A

 | 

I did not take …the water… I never even hear what they are talking about, I could not concentrate. And that is the time---that is around the time when I said I was in pain, and **_I also requested to see a doctor._**

### Accused’s account of urination event at 5.15 pm

61     Mr Eswaran’s account[^76] was that an episode of impending diarrhoea had caused him to rush into a female toilet cubicle. _In his own words “I really could not control, I rushed to the toilet.”[^77]_ The officers had also rushed alongside to escort him. On what happened in the toilet, Mr Eswaran’s testimony was simply “_I had diarrhoea and … I need to pee during that time_” and that “_I could not contain the urine because I don’t have a container with me_”[^78]. On being asked whether the officers’ accounts that he had been proffered container bottles to urinate into just before he rushed into the toilet were accurate, the accused claimed that the urge was _“uncontrollable_” with “_terrible_” pain, and he could not even hear the officers offering the bottles, and asserted that he would have forced his way in if he had been obstructed. The passage is reproduced to allow a sense of the accused’s vehemence and somewhat belligerent tone in his responses[^79]:

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

Okay. Just before you rushed to the toilet, did the officers give you the containers and told you that you had to pee into the bottle like what is stated, “He was asked to give his urine sample and refused.”

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

During that time, I could not hear what they are talking. I could not concentrate what’s---on happening. I was only focused on my pain, it was terrible.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

And the entry goes on, “He was asked to choose 2 red bottles from a box---from box and he refused to comply.” So, we---were you given 2 red bottles?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

They also stated that I rushed to the toilet. I rushed, so I didn’t hear what they’re talking. **_I was only focused on my pain, it was unbearable. And also going to have uncontrollable bowels_**. **_So, if someone is obstructing the toilet, I would have pushed in, it was that urgent_**.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

62     Mr Eswaran recalled his stools being watery and yellow. He did not remember the officers standing close by to have any containers in their hand or to have brandished any such receptacles in offering. He asserted that he would have _“given_” his urine to them at that point had these collection containers been available. The accused asserted that urine had emerged as “_nature’s course_” [^80]:

>   
| 

DC:

 | 

Okay. At that stage when you’re urinating, did you have difficulty in urinating? Was your flow normal?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

No. I had problem with my anal, so I was having diarrhoea. So,--- urinating, **_it was a nature’s course, it came urine. I---when---usually, a human being urine, they also---when they go for pass motion, they also urine._**

It’s normal.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

So, what you are saying is that when you went to defecate, your urine came in a natural way?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

**_Natural way_**.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

63     After his bowel movement and urination, Mr Eswaran claimed to have been beset by extreme weakness _“because everything in my stomach got flushed out”_ and had then “collapsed to the floor”[^81]. His condition had prompted the officers to call for an ambulance. According to the accused, he “_was on the floor; the paramedics came and carried me._ **_I was unable to even wake up_**”[^82]. Somewhat incongruously, despite his declared state of unconsciousness, Mr Eswaran recalled that “_I was twitching in pain. It was a terrible pain_” in his abdominal area which caused him to “_twitch and turn”[^83]_

### Inconsistencies in court testimony and police statements as well as Case for the Defence

64     Mr Eswaran’s court testimony did not cohere with his own Case for the Defence (CFD). The relevant portion of the handwritten portion[^84] of the accused’s CFD states:

> “…I was taken to Ang Mo Kio Police station, at about 2 pm plus, nearly 3 pm. **_I was given water to drink in order to provide urine sample. As I drank the water, my stomach started to have a very excruciating pain. I went into a state of spasms, collapsed and lost consciousness_**. No in-house doctor came for medical attention. The CNB officers called for an ambulance. I was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. After stabilizing my condition, the KTPH doctors transferred me to Changi General Hospital. I did not refuse to give urine but the unfortunate situation of my sudden medical condition I was unable to provide urine.” \[Emphasis added\]

### Scarcity of detail in cautioned statement

65     This differed markedly from the accused’s own Cautioned Statement, which was recorded on 25 May 2018, where he had stated:

> “I did not give my urine **_because I had a seizure_**. CNB called for ambulance. Immediately I was brought to the nearest hospital and was admitted. I was in KTPH for 1 day, and GGH for another day. I was then discharged and transferred to CMC and was given 9 days _(sic)_ hospitalisation leave.”

66     What is remarkable about Mr Eswaran’s Cautioned Statement is its **_sparseness_** in potentially exculpatory detail, even where he had included extraneous details such as his hospitalization itinerary, which had no bearing to his defence. Mr Eswaran has alleged that he was ‘rushed’ by the investigation officer to completing the statement[^85]. I would note, however, that the statement appears to disclose a sequentially complete chain of events, with no interruption evident. At this point, where about a fortnight has elapsed since his arrest, there is the conspicuous **_absence_** of any detail of his suffering abdominal pains, progressing to an episode of diarrhoea, which had triggered his episode of involuntary urination in the women’s toilet. Given the accused had, at the witness stand, cited abdominal pain, and diarrhoea to be the principal ailments where had prevented him from giving his urine sample, their omission in a document created close to the time of the event was perplexing.

### Conflicting symptoms between Case for the Defence and Cautioned Statement

67     While Mr Eswaran did allude to an episode of excruciating abdominal pain in his Case for the Defence[^86], the account was not without has its own set of peculiarities, not least by his alluding to going into a state of **“****_spasms”_**, collapsing and losing consciousness, as a contrast from his previous terse mention of suffering a “**_seizure_**” before being hospitalised. He had again failed to make any reference to his rushing to the toilet to void his bowels, and in quick[^87] succession, his bladder.

### Conflicting accounts of provision and drinking of water between Case for the Defence and court testimony

68     Perhaps the most enigmatic aspect of his Case for the Defence is the preceding statement that “_I was given water to drink_ **_in order to provide urine sample_**_. As_ **_I drank the water…”._** In this CFD Mr Eswaran **_explicitly connects_** the provision of water to facilitate his urine production. He also commits his case to his **_drinking_** of the **_water_** so provided, which had triggered off abdominal symptoms. This is, of course, quite distinct from the stance he took at trial, where the only liquid he consumed was the _Coke_, soda which accompanied his _Briyani_ meal, which he had requested for, to provide sustenance to his pregnant girlfriend.

### Accused’s description of immediate symptoms in Case for the Defence

69     Mr Eswaran’s allusion to “**_As_** _I drank the water, my stomach_ **_started t_**_o have a very excruciating pain”_ implies an immediate or at least a very brief temporal span between meal and symptom. By his own account, he had begun is meal at 3.00pm, and completed this at 3.30pm, but had been absent of any troubling symptom until he reported the first indications of _‘churning’_ at 4.00 pm. Despite this, he had not even asked to see a doctor until 5.00pm.

### Use of alleged meal and drink as a variant of spiking defence

70     The absence of the meal and drink in both the conditioned statement and the CFD weakens its veracity. If there had indeed been such a meal, Mr Eswaran would have been expected to reflect and draw the connection between meal and gastrointestinal distress while convalescing in Changi General Hospital, giving ample time for inclusion into the conditioned statement, which was recorded a fortnight later. Trial courts have been enjoined to exercise ‘spiking’ defences with caution. In _Cheng Siah Johnson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 839</span>, Yong Pung How CJ noted the prevalence of the use of _“spiking”_ and the attribution of drug intoxication to having unknowingly consuming drinks proffered by strangers and held at \[15\]:

> …These are allegations that are extremely easy to make but which are almost impossible to debunk. Although it is not the law that a commonly-used defence will not be accepted, **_a judge may be obliged to approach such a defence with greater caution and circumspection than usual in the absence of any other credible evidence_**… \[Emphasis added\]

### Evaluation of evidence of the narcotics officers

71     Even where a trial court is enjoined to view accused persons’ allegations of spiking with circumspection; at the distaff end of the prosecution’s case, it will not do for the trial judge to blindly or unquestioningly accept that the prosecution witnesses had no reason to implicate the accused. In \[39\] of _Loo See Mei v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 27</span>, the High Court underscored the need to objectively evaluate the credibility of the prosecution witnesses’ evidence from a holistic scrutiny of the evidence adduced in the prosecution’s case:

> First, when a trial judge wishes to make a finding that the complainant or prosecution witness had no reason to falsely implicate the accused, he must base such a finding on credible evidence. This is founded on the principle of common sense that **_any finding of a trial judge must be based on some credible evidence to support his or her decision in order for that finding to be sound._** \[Emphasis added\]

72     The two principal prosecution witnesses of fact were PW1 Officer Jagan and PW 3; Officer Clinton Lim. A third officer, PW 2; CNB Sergeant Muhammad Amirrudin Bin Tokuman, had been called as he had been the maker of P5, the report detailing Mr Eswaran’s arrest for failure to provide a urine sample on 9 May 208 at 2.42 am. Officer Amirrudin had made the report at PW3’s behest, and did **_not_** witness the key events of this case. His role was thus limited to confirming the contemporaneity of PW3’s report, which appeared to have been made upon Officer Lim standing down from his escorting duties at KTPH.

73     Both officers were long term veterans of CNB, with Officer Lim logging ten years to Officer Jagan’s seven in the Bureau. Both were therefore familiar with the requite procedures of urine collection for drug testing. Within the CNB premises, there was no dispute that Mr Eswaran had close access to drinking water commencing from the time of commencement of his urine collection regime at 3.00 pm to the urination episode in the toilet at 5.15 pm on 8 May 2018. Officer Jagan indicated that the holding area, where Mr Eswaran was held, was just next to a water cooler machine. Hence, even allowing the implausible; that a meal had, _per_ Mr Eswaran’s case, been served during the urine collection regime, there was no reason for this meal to be accompanied by a can of Coke, given the easy availability of water.

74     Officer Lim’s evidence, corroborated by the entries in the Station Diary, was that he had coaxed the accused with half-hour offers to drink a cup of water to induce urine production, if necessary. Mr Eswaran’s lack of urgency to even made any serious attempt to induce urine production despite constant blandishments by Officer Lim to take a drink adds considerable force to the prosecution’s case of an outright refusal to co-operate. This being particularly so when he had been informed of the prospect of term of punishment which would be equivalent to that of LT-1 drug offenders, if he failed to provide the specimen. While both officers had been involved in the raid of Cameron Hotel where Mr Eswaran, Ms Indumathi and Mr Shanker had been arrested, neither had any previous runs-in or adverse experience with Mr Eswaran, and thus would be, in my view, unlikely to have antecedent _‘bad-blood’_ with the accused as to form a motive to stage a spiking of the claimed meal of _Briyani_ and Coke, to cause the debilitating symptoms described and sabotage the very urine collection process that they had been placed in charge of.

### The accused’s prolonged urination in the toilet was a deliberate act

75     Further Mr Eswaran’s claimed lack or urinary urge between 3.00pm and 5.00pm belies the fact that at the bowel movement and urination episode at 5.15 pm on 8 May 2018, _both_ Officers Jagan and Lim witnessed Mr Eswaran passing a what they described as a “steady flow” which was sufficient to fill up “_two red bottles or three master bottles of urine”_, Officer Lim had seen the urine steam taking “_15 to 20 seconds_” in all. Notably in all this time, Mr Eswaran, who had already refused to take a collection cup or paused his stream to allow urine to be collected. The officers had assiduously and contemporaneously documented the interactions in the Station Diary.

76     Against the officers’ accounts, Mr Eswaran had while giving his evidence, sought to explain that he has spontaneously urinated while defecating, stating _“…because when I was pass motioning_ (sic)_, urine came, it’s a natural course.”[^88]_

77     Mr Eswaran’s explanation defies established medical urological physiology, and seems to ignore the fact that the urine sphincter[^89] is **_medically_** known to be voluntary muscle, This being so, Mr Eswaran never seeks to explain why he could not withhold the remainder of this reportedly copious stream of urine within this rather long time frame of 15-20 seconds, especially after being made aware of the severe consequences attendant to the offence he would commit in failing to deliver a specimen without reasonable excuse.

### Mr Eswaran’s symptoms are medically unconnected with any relevant urinary condition

78     Mr Eswaran had claimed a host of troubling complaints which included abdominal pain, giddiness; diarrhoea; painful twitches and nausea. The medical evidence, however, does not connect these as being symptomatic of any condition leading to an individual’s inability to urinate. This much is clear from the evidence of the two medical doctors called to the stand. Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim had palpated Mr Eswaran and reflected the view that _“(a)t that point of time, even though_ (Mr Eswaran) _was groaning…it didn’t look like it was excruciating_ (pain)”[^90], Dr Lim explained that all “pain” documented was _per_ Mr Eswaran’s own complaints, and she had not found any extrinsic clinical signs to explain or substantiate his pain.

79     Both doctors had earnestly investigated Mr Eswaran’s complaints, first with a non-invasive computed tomography (CT) scan where, according to Dr Lim, the pelvic scan observed the presence of urine n Mr Eswaran’s bladder, and she had not visualised any organic obstruction of the bladder. There were also no defects to Mr Eswaran’s urogenital system, which might impede urinary function.

80     At CGH, Dr Foo performed a second opinion CT review[^91] in Changi General Hospital. concurred with Dr Lim’s opinion, and undertook the additional procedure of a sigmoidoscopy was performed on Mr Eswaran to examine Mr Eswaran’s bowel, showed the site to be “_essentially normal”[^92]_ and “_there were no other possible causes to explain his complaint of abdominal pain other than there were faeces in his large bowel_”. Given that both doctors had testified that Mr Eswaran was able to pass urine, there did not appear, from the various medical investigations undertaken, be any medical impediment affecting Mr Eswaran’s ability to pass urine.

### The medical evidence points to the accused being untruthful about his symptoms

81     Taken together, Mr Eswaran’s account of his symptoms are irreconcilable with the medical evidence. This is with reference to his account of events starting from the latter part of the urine collection regime, through his post urination “collapse”, unconscious state while evacuated, and his pains while being examined by the doctor.

82     Mr Eswaran was the sole witness for his case. There were various aspects of his evidence both in content and the manner the accused gave his testimony, which would cause a court to give pause in assessing the accused to be credible. The High Court in _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>; <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 333</span> divided the taxonomy for the assessment of a witness’ credibility in three distinct domains (at \[9\] of the judgment):

> 9    A judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:

>> (a)    His **_demeanour_**.

>> (b)    The **_internal consistency_** (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence.

>> (c)    The **_external consistency_** (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

83     As a demonstrable proxy for demeanour, I had observed Mr Eswaran’s cavalier manner of answering the questions posed to him, where he had often veered to hyperbole, obvious exaggeration, and of course; plain contradiction. Examples of these tendencies abound in the direct quotes I have set out in these grounds. Perhaps one the more glaring examples would be the accused’s account of collapsing into unconsciousness to the floor where he declared himself “_unable to even wake up”_[^93]. Notwithstanding this, the accused described himself to be _‘twitching in pain. It was a terrible pain_’ immediately after his defecation and urination episode. Perhaps realising the contradiction, Mr Eswaran made an adroit about-turn in the next series of responses, and prevaricated on whether he was truly unconscious or not when he described the scene when the paramedics arrived[^94]:

>   
| 

Accused:

 | 

They put on the siren and everything, they lifted me. **_I didn’t know what was happening around me._**

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

**_I don’t know whether I lose conscious or not._**

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

Correct. That evidence has to come from the paramedics[^95] who attended to you.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Lack of external consistency

84     In the realm of **_external_** consistency, Mr Eswaran’s account of the symptoms of his claimed conditions of urinary inhibition and abdominal pain run counter to the extrinsic medical evidence of doctors who actually examined him and took special efforts to run a CT scan and a sigmoidoscopy to confirm their observations. Ultimately, as detailed in the foregoing paragraphs, Mr Eswaran’s rendition of his medical travails is **_externally inconsistent_** with the findings of both Dt Aileen Chelsea Lim and Dr Foo Man Yik, where the doctors had indicated the absence of medical evidence that the accused had suffered from any known clinical condition which would cause problems with the production or excretion of urine.

### Instances of internal inconsistency

85     There is substantial **_internal inconsistency_** in Mr Eswaran’s own evidence in several respects. One, as alluded to above, is his evolving evidence on whether he had indeed lost consciousness immediately after his urination. Another, which has already been covered in detail above, would be Mr Eswaran’s complete failure to mention that he had suffered from abdominal pain or diarrhoea in his Cautioned Statement or the Case for the Defence. Of course, as I had earlier observed, the accused’s two statements themselves are hardly in concordance with each other.

86     Curiously enough, Mr Eswaran had informed Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim that he had abdominal pains, **_but not mentioned diarrhoea[^96]_**. There was thus no mention of the accused suffering diarrhoea in the referral form Dr Lim had completed at 9.00pm on 8 May 2018. In the form, Dr Lim had given the brief case details as “_He claimed to be unable to urinate, giddiness and abdominal pain_.”[^97], Mr Eswaran’s relevant history as “_ABDOMINAL PAIN”_[^98] and also her advice on further treatment to be “_to seek treatment if worsening abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting_”[^99] in this referral form to Changi General Hospital.

### Accused related differing symptoms to CNB officers and doctors

87     Equally curiously, Mr Eswaran had conversely **_not told_** Officer Jagan that he had suffered **_abdominal pain_** but had referenced impending diarrhoea[^100] at the time of his asking to use the toilet. The accused had only claimed to suffer abdominal pain much later when he asked for an ambulance to be called[^101]. His colleague: PW3, Officer Clinton Lim, also recalled Mr Eswaran making no reference to any abdominal pain when he asked to use the toilet at about 5.15pm. The accused had, at that point, flatly refused Officer Lim’s request to take a urine bottle with him to the toilet[^102]. Officer Lim recalled a significant amount of **_time_** to have elapsed after the urination incident before Mr Eswaran reported stomach pains, which had prompted the officers to call for an ambulance. Officer Lim’s testimony was:

> _“(A)t_ **_about 7:00pm_**, the accused **_suddenly complained of acute pain_** at the abdominal area. He informed me that he’s in great pain, that is why I told my officer to activate the ambulance.”

> \[Emphasis added\]

88     This would allow for a sizeable interval of more than **_one-and-a-half hours_** between the urination episode and Mr Eswaran’s first complaint of acute abdominal pains to the CNB officers. The time of registration of the accused’s case in KTPH, which has been determined to be 7.45pm[^103] supports Officer Lim account and placement of the time of Mr Eswaran’s first complaints as 7.00 pm. This would be the only rational deduction when one considers the close proximity between KTPH and the CNB holding area in Ang Mo Kio, and the sheer improbability of Mr Eswaran being left medically unattended in the CNB facility for such a long duration[^104], if the accused had truly collapsed into the near-insensate state he claimed to have, immediately after his urination episode, _per_ his testimony[^105] What is significant about Mr Eswaran’s consecutive incomplete accounts of his alleged symptoms would be that these discrepant versions lend credence to the prosecution’s case that the accused had fabricated **_both_** his diarrhoea and abdominal pain symptoms to explain his claim of spontaneous urination. Mr Eswaran’s failure to even mention any abdominal pain until more than one-and-a-half hours after the urination episode, smacks of a _post hoc_ contrivance to terminate the urine collection regime by inducing a fabricated medical emergency.

89     The accused failure to mention his asserted diarrheal episode to Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim is even more telling. It is, in my view, highly improbable for a person who had suffered diarrhoea to sudden **_forget_** to mention this, especially while he was being examined by a medical doctor, who had not merely examined him, but taken the effort to conduct an investigative X-ray and a CT scan of his abdominal and pelvic area. It would be expected that most individuals who have suffered a bout of diarrhoea would be concerned about the possibility of a **_recurrent_** bout of loose stools and thus be naturally anxious to be prescribed with suitable medications[^106] as a _prophylaxis_ against yet another episode. Mr Eswaran had, after all, claimed to have discharged watery diarrheal stools he described as ‘_yellow-liquid’[^107]_, which had caused his spontaneous urination, and left him with abdominal pain, and a drained state, so traumatic that he had collapsed. Mr Eswaran’s period of interaction with Dr Lim was neither short nor cursory, as his case had been registered at 7.45 pm in KTPH, and Dr Lim had signed off on the referral memorandum[^108] at 9.00pm after appending her own observations of the X-ray and CT scan results she had ordered. She had made no fewer than three annotations on his condition and suggested treatment in the document. None of these made any reference to diarrhoea, as Mr Eswaran had never mentioned any such episode to her. This omission bolsters the impression that Mr Eswaran’s ‘diarrhoea’ was merely a **_“cover story”_** for him to gain access to the toilet, and he had, in the time elapsed between his complaint of abdominal pain and arrival at KTPH somehow lost track of this element of his fabricated narrative.

### Accused’s conflicting accounts have him suffering concurrently from diarrhoea and constipation on the same day

90     Even among the two doctors who had examined him, Mr Eswaran had not been able to communicate his symptoms in a coherent manner. His failure to identify the area of abdominal pain to Dr Lim has already been dealt with earlier in these grounds. Dr Foo Man Yik, who had seen him after his transfer to CGH surprisingly quoted the accused’s medical history in the following terms “_Mr. Eswaran Rajasevran, was admitted to Changi General Hospital from 9 to 10 May 2018 for 2 days history of central abdominal pain_ **_and constipation_**_”._ Dr Foo acknowledged that the referral minute from KTPH had made no reference to constipation. His recollection of recording the accused having constipation for two days was that it was Mr Eswaran[^109] himself who had had related his **_two-day_** history of constipation to him. Given that Dr Foo had seen the accused at 3.00 pm on 9 May 2018, Mr Eswaran would effectively from his separate disclosures to the CNB officers just before entering the toilet on 8 May 2018 and Dr Foo the day after, be holding the position that he **_was suffering from both severe diarrhoea and constipation_** in the evening of 8 May 2018.

91     Mr Eswaran appeared to have caught between a lie and an omission. As Dr Lim had **_not_** recorded the accused to have suffered any diarrhoea, Dr Foo was none the wiser, and other than information gleaned from interviewing the accused, had only the CT and Xray scans showing colonic dilatation, and the clerked notes of Dr Lim’s memorandum describing Mr Eswaran’s acute central abdominal pain to work with. Ignorant of the accused’s complaints of diarrhoea, Dr Foo had performed a sigmoidoscopy on his own accord, and found faecal matter in the accused’s colon, which in his view “_could potentially explain constipation_” in the absence of any medical explanation[^110] for his complaint of abdominal pain. Dr Foo had thus given him laxatives to relieve the apparent constipation.

### Findings

92     Given the evidence set out in the foregoing paragraphs of these grounds, these are my findings of fact

> (i)     Mr Eswaran was **_not_** given a meal of _Briyani_ and _Coke_ at 3.00 pm when the urine collection regime commenced. As recorded in the Station Diary, Mr Eswaran **_did not_** cooperate in the five documented instances between 3.00 pm and 5.00 pm to provide a urine sample and refused drinks intended to facilitate urine production.

> (ii)     Mr Eswaran refused to take a urine collection bottle as he entered the female toilet of the CNB facility in Ang Mo Kio at or about 5.15 pm on 8 May 2018 and **_did_** defecate into the toilet bowl but **_did not_** suffer a bout of diarrhoea.

> (ii)     Mr Eswaran **_did_** stand up and urinate into the toilet bowl, and his urination was a voluntary act, and not one triggered by alleged abdominal pains.

> (iii)     Mr Eswaran **_did not_** collapse into an unconscious state onto the floor of the CNB facility after coming out of the toilet., and he **_did not_** complain of abdominal pain until close to 7.00 pm, whereupon emergency services were called to convey him to KTPH.

> (v)     In KTPH, Mr Eswaran **_did not_** tell Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim that he had a bout of diarrhoea.

> (vi)     In CGH, Mr Eswaran **_did_** tell Dr Foo Man Yik in the afternoon of 9 May 2018 that he was suffering from constipation.

> (vii)     During his hospitalization, CGH medical personnel **_did_** collect Mr Eswaran’s urine in a sterile receptacle, which upon analysis was found to be positive for the specified drug, _methamphetamine_.

93     From the above, it is all too clear that there have been multiple instances where Mr Eswaran has been caught in contradictions (either by way of irreconcilable discrepancies while describing a singular event, or stating a _sequelae_ to an event that is impossibly inconsistent to the first event), where at least one version of the two conflicting versions could not possibly be true. Put simply, the statement is a lie. The proper manner for the treatment of such untrue statements was considered by the High Court in _Er Joo Nguang and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 756</span>, where Yong CJ held at \[52\]:

> The relevant authority on the effect of lies told by an accused is the English case of _R v Lucas_ (Ruth) <span class="citation">\[1981\] 1 QB 720</span>; \[1981\] 2 All ER 1008. There, the English Court of Appeal held that the mere fact that an accused told lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, although these lies could, in appropriate circumstances, amount to corroboration because it indicated a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at 724 that there were four criteria to be satisfied before an accused’s lie could amount to corroboration:

>> The lie … must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a **_material issue_**. Thirdly, t**_he motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth._** … Fourthly, the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by \[independent\] evidence …

> \[Emphasis in the original\]

94     The four criteria of the renowned ‘_Lucas test’_ all involve findings of fact. Illustrations of lies Mr Eswaran told both during the course of police investigations and in his court testimony which satisfy all criteria of the Lucas test would include Mr Eswaran insisting that a meal and drink had been provided at exactly the time that the drug testing regime was being undertaken. This seemed a device to set-up a defence of “spiking” to explain his incapacitation to a degree that he could not provide a urine sample, and implicate the officers he was in the charge of, notwithstanding that neither had dealt with the accused until 8 May 2018.

95     Mr Eswaran’s contention that he had suffered an episode of diarrhoea would be another instance. In evaluating the entirety of the factual matrix, this was contrived for Mr Eswaran to gain urgent entry to the female toilet of the CNB holding facility, as he would likely be facing a degree of pressing need to urinate, after two hours and fifteen minutes into the urine collection regime.

96     The accused has also orchestrated his medical evacuation by feigning abdominal pains at 7.00pm. Mr Eswaran was ultimately hoist on his own petard when he forgot to relate his fabricated diarrheal episode to Dr Lim, who had naturally omitted any reference in her memorandum to Mr Foo, which in turn, led to Dr Foo making a diametrically opposed diagnosis of constipation. The eventual finding of _methamphetamine_ in the accused’s urine sample taken at CGH would cap the inquiry of any motive Mr Eswaran would have had for his series of lies told and other deceptive conduct undertaken in relation to this present charge.

### The accused’s prolonged urination in the CNB toilet and self-declared intent to refuse to co-operate would have made further waiting fruitless

97     Counsel in his Submissions for Defence asserted that Mr Eswaran’s urine collection regime had been truncated prematurely. He states

> 17.    When asked during cross examination what this required time was, PW 3 testified that the Accused was required to give his urine within six (6) hours from the start of the Station Diary, Since the Station Diary started at 3.00 pm on 8 May 2018, **_the Accused should have had till 9.00pm the same day to provide a sample of his urine_**.

98     This is aligned with the point Mr Eswaran claimed he was “deprived” of the opportunity by his evacuation, and would have complied to provide the sample if and when his alleged pain subsided:

>   
| 

Accused:

 | 

Yes. I wanted to overcome with my pain, then give urine as…per required.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright. And …in other words, …all these happened before you had time to provide your urine sample?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

**_Yes, Your Honour. Because in couple of hours, I was evacuated from the police station_**.[^111]

 |

  
  

99     On counsel’s point of the truncation of the urine test at the two hour and fifteen minute mark, I would note that section 31(2) of the MDA simply provides that a person under reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence under section 8(b) of the Act, commits an offence if he fails “_without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of his urine_ **_within such time as may be required by any of the officers”_** . The Act does not specify a minimum allowance of time for a suspect to comply with the officer’s requirement to produce a urine specimen, although being given an unreasonably short time[^112] might give an accused person a basis to argue that he had a reasonable excuse for his failure to comply. On the instant facts therefore, the question arises whether Mr Eswaran was afforded a reasonable opportunity to comply.

100    While Officer Clinton Lim had indicated that the urine regime would usually extend for six hours to allow time for urine to be produced, I do note that Mr Eswaran had essentially voided the contents of his bladder in the urine stream lasting some 15-20 seconds, after what he had been evacuated to hospital at about 7.00 pm. Given his commitment not to co-operate including his outright expressed refusal to drink any water to induce urination, and the physical voiding of the bladder at 5.15 pm, it was, in my view, **_unlikely_** that a sample would have eventuated. It should also be quite clear that the activation of the ambulance had been triggered by Mr Eswaran’s own demands for medical attention over symptoms which he had variously described in his pre-trial statements as spasms or seizure, and at trial as diarrhoea followed by sudden abdominal pains.

101    What is significant in this instance is that Mr Eswaran’s position remained **_unchanged_** even after his conveyance to KTPH. To recap, Officer Jagan, who had, with Officer Lim, escorted Mr Eswaran to KTPH, recalled that his colleague had continued to ask the accused to provide his urine. Mr Eswaran had resisted this and Officer Jagan recalled the accused acting in a violent manner and struggling in the vicinity of the toilet, to the point where he had to be forcibly restrained by the officers, who were concerned of the alarm he might cause to medical personnel and hospital users[^113]. When cross-examined by counsel, Officer Jagan’s testimony was that the accused has violently shoved his handcuffed arms against the escorting officers while _‘hurling vulgarities’_[^114] against them. All this would, of course, militate against any impression that Mr Eswaran would have been disposed to provide a urine sample after he had been taken to KTPH.

102    Counsel’s other principal submission was that the attempts by the CNB officers was inadequate. He compared the six entries in the Station Diary with the concerted efforts made in another case he had referenced; _Public Prosecutor v Adzhar bin Abdullah[^115]_, where the accused there had been called on 11 occasions to provide his urine sample. There was, however, one critical difference between _Adzhar’s_ case and the instant one: the accused; Mr Adzhar had been returned to police/CNB custody, after a short sojourn in KTPH to investigate his complaints of abdominal pain, where the two final entries had been logged. Five of the entries had been made in the officers’ field dairies[^116] while he was in KTPH.

103    In the instant case PW1 and PW3 were not accorded the option of continuing the process in Ang Mo Kio, as Mr Eswaran had been sent to Changi General Hospital, rather than repatriated to the CNB facilities to resume the urine collection regime. This was again precipitated by circumstances **_created_** by the accused, where he had, in the manner outlined in the discussion above, been uncooperative with the medical examination, and had so vexed the attending doctor; Dr Aileen Chelsea Lim, with his non-specific replies that she had, in an abundance of caution, referred Mr Eswaran to CGH. Both officers were stood down before this transfer when a replacement team arrived.

104    In _Adzhar’s_ case, the accused failed, despite the 11 calls, to provide a urine sample, and was convicted. His appeal was dismissed by the High Court on 25 November 2019. As a notable parallel, _Adzhar_ involved an episode of surreptitious urination, where the accused’s bedsheet was found soaked with a fluid with chemical attributes of urine. This paled, of course with the situation here, where actual urination had been observed at the lock-up, and a subsequent collection of urine produced by the accused via a sterile receptacle at CGH, had returned a result that Mr Eswaran’s urine had contained _methamphetamine_.

105    Ultimately all that the defence could rely on was the accused’s confusing melange of conflicting symptoms. Counsel had indicated his interest in calling the attending paramedics and Ms Indumathi but had not followed through. Not calling the paramedic would not be damaging as they might not be in a position to give very cogent evidence other than remark on his mental state and level of consciousness at the time, given their brief interaction with the accused. Not calling Ms Indumathi, however, would be particularly problematic for the defence case, as she might have been able to offer valuable insights on any manifestation of Mr Eswaran’s gastrointestinal symptoms in terms of abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea in the period preceding their arrest, whether she had, or had not, seen Mr Eswaran consuming _methamphetamine_, and quite essentially, whether the _Briyani_ and Coke meal, the apparent precursor of his alleged stomach problems, had indeed been served at 3.00pm on 8 May 2018, in a seeming breach of the prescribed urine collection protocol.

106    The case-law in relation to the defence calling a material witness is quite clear in this regard. In _Public Prosecutor v Nurashikin bte Ahmad Borhan_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 52</span>; <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 242</span>, the High Court held (at \[24\]):

> …(I)**_f the Prosecution has made out a complete case against the defendant and yet the defence has failed to call a material witness when calling such a witness is the only way to rebut the Prosecution’s case_**, illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act then **_allows the court to draw an adverse inference against the defendant_**…This is based on the commonsense notion that if the only way for the Defence to rebut the Prosecution’s case is to call a particular witness, then her failure to do so naturally raises the inference that even that witness’s evidence will be unfavourable to her.

107    Given this, I found it appropriate to draw an adverse inference against the accused for his failure to call Ms Indumathi as a witness.

108    Given that Mr Eswaran demonstrably had no medical impediment inhibiting the production and excretion of urine, he would have no reasonable excuse for his failure to produce a specimen of his urine, Indeed, the circumstances irreducibly show Mr Eswaran to have wilfully refused to provide a urine sample. Thus, I found that the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubt, and convicted Mr Eswaran on the proceeded charge that he had contested.

### Brief comments on sentence

109    Mr Eswaran’s appeal was stated to be against conviction for the single contested charge. I would nevertheless, for completeness, briefly state the basis for the final sentence imposed for that contested charge, in the perspective of other charges he decided to plead guilty to. This is because Mr Eswaran, while represented by Mr Thirumurty during the trial, appeared to be **_unrepresented_** when he sent his notice of appeal _via_ a facility provided by prison authorities. Hence, while the accused has not expressly appealed against the sentence imposed, I thought it to be in the best interests of openness and transparency in judicial process that an unrepresented appellant should be afforded an opportunity to understand, on a **_holistic_** perspective, the reasons for the penalty he was ultimately sentenced to serve.

### Guilty plea to insurance fraud and cheating charges

110    After his conviction, Mr Eswaran signalled that he wished to accept the prosecution’s offer and plead guilty to eight charges in relation to offences under the Penal Code, where the majority involved cheating. These were connected with his staging of motor vehicle accidents, as a means of obtaining pay-outs by motor insurance companies[^117] from fraudulent vehicular damage and fabricated personal injury claims from deliberate collisions, which had executed with a group of confederates working for a syndicate. Mr Eswaran also consented to the taking into consideration of six similar charges. The syndicate had made claims of some $160 000 from five motor insurers.

### Ex-tempore sentencing remarks

111    Mr Eswaran’s sentence was in _general parity_ of that of his co-accused after I had adjusted to factor in the _‘relevant difference’[^118]_ of his role as a recruiter within the syndicate. In sentencing, I made the following remarks[^119]:

> Mr. Eswaran’s higher role in hierarchy as a recruiter of the syndicate (is noted). The Court is mindful of the need to send an appropriate and strong deterrent message. It is quite evident in the manner the scheme was perpetrated that the staged accidents were not difficult to perpetrate where a group of determined individuals come together with the material wherewithal and will to defraud the accident claim system. False claims, if allowed to proliferate, will cause substantial losses to insurers. The ultimate victims, however, will be hapless motorists, as these losses would consequently result in insurers increasing most of their insurance premiums to offset losses arising from paying these fraudulent claims. Uncovering these schemes that require considerable investments of time and effort of diverse stakeholders and parties including insurance companies, investigators and the police, all expended to thwart Mr. Eswaran’s bid to defraud the insurance claim system.

### Prosecution’s position on sentencing

112    In sentencing, the learned DPP[^120] had asked for an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence of five years and three strokes, arguing that there ought be a difference in sentence between an offender who has claimed trial and an offender who had pleaded guilty early, submitting that an increase of six months from ‘_would suffice to make that difference_’.

113    In relation to the accused’s criminal record, Mr Eswaran did, of course, have considerable drug-related antecedents[^121], as well as a history of driving, rioting and property-related offences, with no fewer than 15 non-drug-related entries in his CRO 60 dating from 2000-2013.

114    I was of the view that Mr Eswaran had conducted himself most egregiously in presenting an incoherent defence, riddled with untruths and contradictions. He had also cast aspersions to impugn the integrity of the narcotics officers where he had alluded to a fictitious meal provided at the time of his urine collection to have caused gastrointestinal distress, insinuating that he had somehow been spiked.

115    Given this I would not have ordinarily found the learned DPP’s recommendation of a **_six-month_** uplift to be at all unreasonable. Nevertheless, given that Mr Eswaran’s sentence for the Penal Code offences would be for substantial terms of imprisonment (given the need to achieve relative parity with his confederate co-offenders), I was of the view that a degree of titration **_downwards_** from the DPP’s recommendation of five years and **_six_** months’ imprisonment, to maintain fidelity with the principles of **_totality[^122]_** and **_proportionality_** in the final sentence. Accordingly, I was of the view that an uplift of **_three_** months above the mandatory minimum sentence would yield a just and proportionate result.

116    Mr Eswaran was thus sentenced to the following terms, with four sentences[^123] ordered to run consecutively, yielding a global term of five years’ 24 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.
