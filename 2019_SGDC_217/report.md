**Antecedents**

7       The accused had the following drug-related antecedents:-

> (a)     On 13 August 1987, the accused was convicted of 3 counts of failure to report for urine test. He was sentenced to a total of 4 months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     On 12 November 1998, the accused was convicted of one count of drug possession, one count of drug consumption and one count of failure to report for urine test. He was sentenced to a total of 4 years’ imprisonment. Two counts of failure to report for urine test were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing;

> (c)     On 25 November 1998, the accused was convicted of one count of drug possession and was sentenced to 26 months’ imprisonment;

> (d)     On 26 June 2003, the accused was convicted of 3 counts of failure to report for his urine test and sentenced to a total of 24 months’ imprisonment;

> (e)     On 12 February 2016, the accused was convicted of one count of “LT1” drug consumption and was sentenced to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment; and

> (f)     The accused was also admitted to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) on 4 occasions i.e. 28 August 1990, 11 July 1991, 19 June 1995 and 31 December 2002.

**Enhanced sentence under s 50T of the Prisons Act**

8       As the mandatory minimum sentences were imposed for both the proceeded charges, the sole issue is whether the enhanced sentence under section 50T of the Prisons Act was appropriate.

9       The accused was on 12 February 2016 sentenced to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for “LT-1” consumption of drugs. He was released from prison on 27 July 2018 on a conditional remission order (“CRO”) under S 50I of the Prisons Act. Pursuant to the CRO, the remaining portion of his sentence from 27 July 2018 to 21 May 2020 (both dates inclusive) was suspended and this was also the period during which the CRO was to be in effect.

10     One of the basic conditions of the CRO was that the accused was not to commit any offence while it was in effect and that he must not be convicted of that offence and sentenced to imprisonment. The CRO also provided that if the accused committed a further offence, he may be given an enhanced sentence not exceeding the remaining duration of the CRO at the date the offence was committed.[^2]

11     The purpose and rational behind the conditional remission scheme, and the sentencing considerations when there is a breach of a basic condition were discussed in _Public Prosecutor v Chandrasegaran s/o Raman_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 105</span>, in which KennethYap, District Judge stated at \[17\]-\[19\]:-[^3]

> 17    To understand the sentencing considerations which should apply to a term of imprisonment for serious breaches of mandatory aftercare conditions, reference should be made to the parliamentary intent behind such a scheme. The Conditional Remission System (“CRS”) and the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (“MAS”) were introduced during the passage of the Prisons (Amendment) Bill on 20 January 2014. The rationale behind both schemes was provided by Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, who said:

>> Currently, inmates are granted one-third remission for good conduct and behaviour in prison, that is, if they have not breached prison discipline. There are no conditions imposed upon their release. In contrast, many jurisdictions have moved away from their colonial precedents. The UK and its former colonies like Canada, New Zealand, and Hong Kong have, over time, implemented parole or conditional release systems that impose conditions on inmates when they are released. This creates the incentive for good behaviour upon release… \[_Emphasis added_\]

>> The CRS seeks to deter ex-inmates from re-offending by subjecting them to conditions upon their release. All inmates will be subject to the CRS upon release.

>> …

> 19.    In closing, the Minister sounded a cautionary note on the need to ensure sufficient deterrence against re-offending:

>> However, at the end of the day, even with the additional support and aftercare provided to the ex-offender, it is ultimately the responsibility of the individual not to re-offend. If he does, he will be dealt with swiftly and strictly by the law. \[_Emphasis added_\]

12     In sentencing the accused, the court had to consider the statutory requirements set out in section 50T(3) of the Prisons Act which provides:-

> (3)    In deciding whether to impose any enhanced sentence under subsection (1) or (2) with respect to any offence, and if so the length of the enhanced sentence, the court shall consider —

>> (a)    the gravity of the offence;

>> (b)    whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;

>> (c)    the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and

>> (d)    all other relevant circumstances.

13     As the accused had re-offended while on remission, I was of the view that an enhanced sentence should be imposed. This was a serious breach of the CRO and there were no factors to indicate that an enhanced sentence should not be imposed.

14     The accused faced serious drug offences which carried heavy minimum sentences. He had re-offended less than two months after his release on conditional remission for the original “LT-1” drug consumption offence. The first charge, which was for drug consumption, was similar to the original offence.

15     The accused stated in mitigation that as he was under stress and drinking too much alcohol, he just happened to smoke “one stick”. In my view, this had no mitigating value since it was the accused’s responsibility to ensure that he complied with the CRO and not re-offend. Rather, it was necessary to treat breaches of CROs strictly, so as to deter those who benefit from early release from failing to comply with the terms of remission.

16     In my assessment, in order to give efficacy to the conditional remission scheme which aims to incentivize good behaviour upon release and to deter re-offending, the maximum term of 617 days’ imprisonment which was equivalent to the remaining period of the remission should be imposed. Having re-offended, the accused should lose the benefit of remission. There were no mitigating factors which indicated that a shorter period could be justified in the circumstances of the case.

17     In totality, I was of the view that sentence imposed was proportionate to the offences committed by the accused.
