Damages – Assessment – Personal Injuries

31 January 2020

### Deputy Registrar Dorothy F M Ling:

1       This matter came before me for the assessment of damages for injuries sustained as a result of a traffic accident.

## BACKGROUND[^1]

2       The male Plaintiff was a prime-mover driver when he met with the traffic accident on 3 February 2013 at around 9.20pm. He was 51 years old then. As a result of the accident, the Plaintiff suffered various injuries.

3       Interlocutory judgment was entered on 25 April 2017 in the Plaintiff’s favour at 90%. I have assessed the damages to be awarded to the Plaintiff and I now render my decision on the same.

### HEADS OF CLAIM / COUNSEL’S SUBMISSIONS ON QUANTUM

4       Counsel for the Plaintiff and the Defendant have submitted their respective amounts for the various of claim. I have displayed them in table form for easy reference. The table listing the injuries also took in the amendments that the medical experts corrected of their reports. These include: “~Left~ Right forearm radius fracture”, “~Left~ Right hand 5th metacarpal fracture”; and “~Right~ Left hand 1st metacarpal fracture”[^2]

5       The heads of claim and the amounts submitted are as follows:

## QUANTUM DETERMINATION

### A.   PAIN & SUFFERING

6       As Plaintiff Counsel astutely observed,[^3] the Plaintiff’s injuries spanned a spectrum of medical disciplines: orthopaedics, otorhinolaryngology, dentistry, psychology/psychiatry and ophthalmology.

7       For some of the injuries the Plaintiff sustained, the parties have managed to come to an agreement on the quantum of damages. For purposes of this Decision, I shall focus only on the injury claims which are in contention.

#### Orthopaedics: ‘Dr Victor Seah v Dr Lee Soon Tai’

8       Considering that many of the Plaintiff’s injuries were bone and joint-related, the evidence of the two opposing experts in this area is particularly pertinent. Dr Victor Seah was the medical doctor who attended to the Plaintiff when he was admitted for treatment, whilst Dr Lee Soon Tai was engaged by the Defence to medically review the Plaintiff. Both doctors were clear that their duty to assist the court was paramount and would override their obligation “to the person from whom \[they\] had received instructions or by whom \[they\] are paid”.[^4]

9       In examining the Plaintiff, both doctors had used the “active range of motion” test[^5] which is “the standard used by the Ministry of Manpower \[(MOM)\] for their “A Guide to the Assessment of Traumatic Injuries and Occupational Disease for Workmen’s Compensation”. As explained by Dr Seah, and agreed by Dr Lee,[^6] ‘active range of motion’ “refers to the ability of the patient to move the affected joint by his own muscular power and pain threshold without the use of any external force”.[^7]

##### Dr Victor Seah’s medical findings

10     Dr Victor Seah examined and treated the Plaintiff many times,[^8] to the tune of “more than 10 times for a whole year and until \[his\] last review with \[the Plaintiff\] in 12 November 2014”.[^9] He had provided 2 reports, one dated 25 September 2013 and the other 30 December 2014. He also adopted the report of Senior Consultant Hand Surgeon, Dr Vaikunthan Rajaratnam’s report made on 20 October 2014 into his evidence-in-chief. [^10]

11     In his first report of 25 September 2013,[^11] Dr Victor Seah reported that the Plaintiff suffered certain restricted motions, such as in his wrist and hand. There was also numbness, stiffness and pain in the same areas. These were observed despite Dr Seah acknowledging that the Plaintiff had “recovered well”.[^12] It is likely that Dr Victor Seah had compared the Plaintiff’s condition at the time of the making of the report, with when the Plaintiff was first admitted for treatment.

12     Dr Victor Seah, and subsequently also Dr Lee Soon Tai, recognised that the Plaintiff sustained residual disabilities and numbness, for example, of his left thumb. Dr Victor Seah considers these “deficits”[^13] as “likely to be permanent”.[^14] The doctors further opined that the Plaintiff had “optimally recovered and there is no further recovery anticipated”.[^15] The same was opined about his lower limb, and particularly his knee flexion: that, the Plaintiff would have reached maximum potential of recovery when still in his – Dr Victor Seah’s – care.[^16] Dr Victor Seah calibrated the Plaintiff’s permanent incapacity of the upper limbs at 20%[^17] whilst that of his lower limbs at 18% (_sic._ See: PD28-29.)

##### Dr Lee Soon Tai’s medical findings

13     During the examination under Dr Lee Soon Tai, the Plaintiff had maintained that he still suffers from “numbing pain” in parts of his hand, and leg (tibia). This is stated in Dr Lee Soon Tai’s report of 5 April 2018[^18] which made reference to the medical examination of the Plaintiff on 22 December 2016.[^19] This was also the only time that Dr Lee Soon Tai had seen and examined the Plaintiff for the injuries sustained on 3 February 2013.

14     According to Dr Lee Soon Tai’s report, the Plaintiff was generally much recovered. His incapacities were also reported as being less serious than as reported by Dr Victor Seah. Dr Lee calibrated the Plaintiff’s upper limbs injuries at 10%.

##### The preferred report – Dr Victor Seah’s or Dr Lee Soon Tai’s?

15     Given the difference in the medical opinions of the two orthopaedic doctors, and particularly in the calibration of the Plaintiff’s injuries, the Court has to decide which medical opinion is to be preferred.

16     Plaintiff Counsel proferred four reasons why Dr Victor Seah’s medical opinion should be preferred:

> (a)     Dr Victor Seah’s medical examination was contemporeaneous as he had treated the Plaintiff upon his admission into the hospital, compared with Dr Lee Soon Tai’s almost 4 years later;

> (b)     Dr Victor Seah’s medical examination was “more comprehensive as he saw the Plaintiff at spaced intervals over a span of nearly two years”[^20] compared with Dr Lee Soon Tai who only examined the Plaintiff once;

> (c)     Dr Victor Seah’s medical opinion was corroborated by Dr Vaikunthan Rajaratnam who was the doctor who continued to follow up with the Plaintiff after he was discharged from the hospital; and

> (d)     Dr Lee Soon Tai had rendered his opinion beyond his scope of orthopaedic expertise when he ventured to opine on the Plaintiff’s memory impairment and dental treatment. Although Dr Lee admitted to this, he pressed the point that “\[a\]s a doctor, we are trained in all aspects”.[^21] This is nevertheless in contravention to Order 40A rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court.

17     A short word on this fourth reason: besides contravening Order 40A rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court, I agree with Plaintiff Counsel that Dr Lee’s opining on an area beyond his expertise compromises the reliability of his opinion on his area of expertise. Aspersion was in fact cast by Plaintiff Counsel when he submitted:

> During re-examination, seemingly to emphasize how thorough his re-examination was, \[Dr Lee Soon Tai\] remarked that he had spent more than an hour… . One wonders how much of this time was actually spent on orthopaedics injuries.

18     As it would be obvious now, I am persuaded by Plaintiff Counsel’s above reasons for why the Court should prefer Dr Victor Seah’s medical opinion. I would, however, like to elaborate on why I consider the contemporaneity of the medical examination as important, if not, crucial.

##### Contemporaneity of the medical examination

19     It is irrefutable that Dr Victor Seah’s medical examination was made, latest, on 4 February 2013 – a mere day after the accident whilst Dr Lee Soon Tai only saw the Plaintiff on 22 December 2016, almost 4 years after the accident. Plaintiff Counsel submitted that it is an important consideration that the medical examination be contemporaneous, and cited _Chang Mui Hoon v Lim Bee Leng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHCR 17</span> as authority for this proposition.

20     Logically, a medical examination made as proximate a time to the occurrence of the incident which caused the injury would enable the medical examiner to know the original condition of the injuries. A subsequent review of the injuries with that knowledge would then allow the examiner to assess more accurately the severity of the injuries by the progress or rate of recovery. In _Chang Mui Hoon_’s case, the Court referred to the “window of opportunity” which would enable the symptoms of the injury to be observed and captured on record. This “window of opportunity” was stated in _Chang Mui Hoon_’s case to be “no more than two to three days after the injury was sustained”.[^22] Clearly, this “window” was ‘shut’ for Dr Lee Soon Tai. So, whilst Dr Lee Soon Tai’s medical review was more updated than Dr Victor Seah’s, for purposes of assessing damages, the contemporaneity of the medical examination is the more valuable.

21     Dr Lee himself agreed with Plaintiff Counsel that his examination was to assess how much of the Plaintiff’s old fractures had recovered.[^23] Yet, he was blind to what Plaintiff Counsel had referred to as “the starting point”,[^24] since he was bereft of the clinical notes of Drs Victor Seah and Vaikunthan Rajaratnam or the x-rays performed on the Plaintiff. Despite this handicap, however, Dr Lee Soon Tai was of the view that his assessment was not impeded. In his oral testimony, he launched into the consultation time between a government doctor of allegedly 1 to 2 minutes and a private doctor’s like himself of apparently more than 1 hour. However, there was no evidence before me that the consultation by the government doctor is in any way compromised because of that or the consultation at the private doctor’s enhanced.

22     Flowing from the above, apart from the other three reasons given by Plaintiff Counsel which I am persuaded by and agree with, there is no reason for me to prefer Dr Lee’s medical report to Dr Victor Seah’s.

23     While I have determined that Dr Victor Seah’s medical report is preferred over Dr Lee Soon Tai’s, I should add that this should not mean that Dr Lee’s report is to be ignored; it is just less preferred. Its contents shall still be examined and the medical opinion considered, but keeping in view its shortfalls, as earlier discussed.

24     With that understanding, I go on to quantify the damages for the Plaintiff’s injuries.

#### Left Hand 1st Metacarpal Fracture

25     It was reported by Dr Victor Seah that about 6 months after the accident, the Plaintiff still experienced, amongst other discomforts, “partial numbness of his left thumb”[^25] and that it is “likely to be permanent”.[^26] Dr Seah also adopted Dr Vaikunthan’s subsequent medical opinion that the Plaintiff has “40 degrees of MPJ \[(metacarpal phalangeal)\] movement is (_sic_) compared to 60 degrees on the right side for the thumb with the 2% loss of hand function. At the IPJ \[(interphalangeal joint)\] he has 50 degrees of movement in the left thumb as compared to 80 degrees on the right side with the loss of 2% of hand function”.[^27] Dr Vaikunthan’s general assessment was that the percentage incapacity of the Plaintiff’s upper limb is 20%. Dr Victor Seah agreed with and adopted this assessment, having reviewed the Plaintiff’s condition over the said period from 4 February 2013 to 12 November 2014.

26     With regard to Dr Lee Soon Tai’s orthopaedic examinations of the Plaintiff, Dr Victor Seah admitted that it might be more updated than his. However, Dr Seah also expressed that he might not totally agree with the findings of the report.[^28]

27     What was clear, however, was that during the examination by Dr Lee almost 4 years after the accident, the Plaintiff was still complaining of numbness.[^29] This showed up even in Dr Lee’s report.[^30] It was also acknowledged by Dr Lee that the Plaintiff had “difficulty opposing his left thumb to his little finger”.[^31] It is Dr Lee’s assessment that the Plaintiff’s permanent incapacity in his left first metacarpal is 2%.

28     Plaintiff Counsel cited the case of _Ley Hock Guan v Low Tong Seng_ DC Suit 2111 of 2000 where S$5,000 was awarded for a third metacarpal fracture and so, submitted an amount of S$6,000 as damages, in view of the thumb being involved.

29     In view also of the “Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases” (hereinafter to be referred to as “Guidelines”) and the fact that the thumb is involved, and the grip also affected, I give a slight uplift from the award in _Ley Hock Guan_’s case and award the sum of S$5,500.

#### Right Hand 4th and 5th Metacarpal Fractures

30     In his report of 25 September 2013, Dr Victor Seah diagnosed the Plaintiff as suffering 2% permanent incapacity for the right hand 5th metacarpal. These were treated conservatively with splint according to Dr Vaikunthan Rajaratnam,[^32] whose medical report was adopted by Dr Victor Seah as part of his evidence-in-chief. Dr Lee Soon Tai assessed the little finger at 3% permanent incapacity.

31     Plaintiff Counsel had again used the case of _Ley Hock Guan_ and submitted damages at S$5,000 each for the right 4th and 5th metacarpal fractures. However, there seems to be a great disparity in the award given in _Ley_’s case and the Guidelines. This is even if this Court keeps in view that the right hand is the Plaintiff’s dominant hand. The absence of more facts in _Ley_’s case also does not assist the Court. However, it is noted that _Ley_ was a toolmaker. It would not be far-fetched to consider that that could possibly be the reason that the injury to his fingers were assessed as such.

32     The Guidelines provided for fracture of fingers in the region of S$2,000.[^33] For the amputation of the little finger, it is “\[i\]n the region of S$4,000” and “partial loss of a little finger (at the joint)” is S$2,500 to S$3,500. Calibrating therefrom, since the Defendant had submitted an amount of S$8,000 for these two fractures, the Court so awards the same.

#### Right Forearm Distal Radius and Ulna Fractures

33     It was reported by Dr Victor Seah that the Plaintiff has “restricted motion in his right wrist as well as decreased grip strength in his right hand”.[^34] Permanent disability totalled 10%. This was not disputed by Dr Lee Soon Tai when he states in his report that the Plaintiff has “a restricted range of right wrist motion in most directions of movement except for radial and ulnar deviations”.[^35] It was also Dr Lee’s observation that there was no wasting of right arm and forearm muscles. However, Dr Lee agreed and was affirmative that the metal implant in the Plaintiff’s wrist restricts the Plaintiff in “extending the wrist beyond 50°.”[^36]

34     In view of the extent of the Plaintiff’s permanent incapacity and reduced range of motion, Plaintiff Counsel relied on the Guidelines on “Wrist” at page 36 and submitted an amount of S$25,000 as damages. He considers the injuries as moderately severe.

35     Defence Counsel on the other hand, had also relied on the Guidelines, but at the portion which relates to “Arm”. He considers the Plaintiff’s fracture to his wrist as one which is “less serious”. Defence Counsel submits an amount of S$8,000.

36     I considered the treatment and surgeries that the Plaintiff had to undergo on his wrist. It is not in dispute that he now has metal implants in his wrist as a result of the accident. It is also not denied that he now suffers permanent disability in his right wrist, at an incapacity of at least 10% (Dr Lee Soon Tai’s assessment), if not 20% (Plaintiff’s orthopaedic doctors). Besides the restriction of movement, he continues to have to bear with a numbing pain. His grip has also been affected. I am unable to see how this falls into the category of “less serious fractures” of the arm.

37     I award an amount of S$18,000 for the Plaintiff’s wrist injury. This also takes into account that it is his right wrist which is injured and the Plaintiff is right hand dominant.

#### Left Proximal Femur (Upper Thigh & Hip Fracture)

38     The Plaintiff underwent surgery for these fractures and the fracture of the right proximal tibia on 4 February 2013. In his report of 25 September 2013, it was noted by Dr Victor Seah, his attendant doctor, that the Plaintiff “has full range of motion in his right knee and left hip”.[^37] It appears that both doctors are synchronised in their views on this since, in his report of 5 April 2018, Dr Lee Soon Tai had reported that “\[t\]he \[Plaintiff’s\] left femoral fracture had since healed with a full active range of left hip motion in all directions of movement, albeit with numbing pain at the lateral aspect of the left hip”.[^38]

39     This would have been smooth if not for Dr Victor Seah’s medical report dated 30 December 2014 which interjected the earlier-mentioned two reports. In this report, Dr Seah recorded the Plaintiff’s “range of motion of his left hip and the percentage of permanent disability” as 18%.[^39] It would therefore seem that the Plaintiff’s hip condition was good (Dr Seah’s 25 September 2013 report), and then deteriorated (Dr Seah’s medical report of 30 December 2014 report) and then improved to full recovery in April 2018 (Dr Lee’s medical report).

40     Plaintiff Counsel explained this ‘phenomenon’ as a situation whereby the Plaintiff’s hip, at the first measurement on 25 September 2013, had not fully recovered. When the measurement was later taken for the December 2014 report, there was progress in the healing. This suggests a more restrictive movement. The doctors not having been questioned on this aspect, the Court does not have the benefit of their medical insight on this. It must be remembered that the burden of proof rests on the Plaintiff.

41     However, Plaintiff Counsel drew the Court’s attention to this same healing pattern with regard to the Plaintiff’s upper limb. In the earlier report of 25 September 2013, the percentage of incapacity of the Plaintiff’s upper limbs was 17%.[^40] A subsequent measurement recorded a 20% incapacity.[^41] That the same should be recorded of the upper limbs should therefore not surprise.

42     In any case, Plaintiff Counsel again submitted for Dr Victor Seah’s medical opinion to be preferred and why Dr Lee Soon Tai’s should be discounted. Dr Lee had opined that the Plaintiff had “a full active range of motion of left hip motion in all directions of movement”.[^42] This was despite Dr Lee acknowledging that the Plaintiff was still having “numbing pain”. (I should add at this juncture that there was no suggestion throughout the trial that the Plaintiff was malingering at any point of time.) So, whilst he recognised that the Plaintiff was still suffering the pain, he maintained that his measurement of the Plaintiff’s full range of movement was nevertheless accurate.

43     I have found the Plaintiff Counsel’s submission on this point particularly compelling. Dr Lee had testified with regard to the wrist, that when there are implants, it will impede the range of motion.[^43] Yet, his own measurement of the Plaintiff’s hip movement had recorded full range of motion despite the implant of the intramedullary nail _in-situ_ at the hip. I should think that the same logic applies, whether it was at the wrist or at the hip. I therefore have my reservations about Dr Lee’s medical opinion with regard to the Plaintiff’s hip injury.

44     The Plaintiff had cited the case of _Loh Chee Wang_ v _Ong Leong Chye_ DC Suit No. 4300 of 2003 and sought an award of S$22,000 for the Plaintiff’s hip injury. The Defendant, on the other hand, relied on the Guidelines for Legs[^44] and characterised this injury as a “\[s\]imple fracture of a femur, tibia or fibula with no damage to articular surfaces. Recovery is uneventful and there is unlikely to be a risk of osteoarthritis in the future”. The range for this is S$6,000 to S$10,000.

45     I cannot agree with both Plaintiff and Defendant on their submitted amounts for this head of claim. I would distinguish _Loh Chee Wang_’s case as the Plaintiff there fractured the neck of his left femur and ended up with 1.5cm shortening and a S$22,000 award for this injury. There is no shortening in the present case.

46     I also disagree with the Defendant in his characterisation and categorisation of the injury in the Guidelines. It trivialises the injuries to characterise the medical treatments the Plaintiff received – with surgeries and 2 implants – as a simple fracture. Also, the Plaintiff now walks with a limp, as was noted by both Dr Victor Seah[^45] and Dr Lee Soon Tai[^46] in their respective reports. Relying on the Guidelines, I consider the Plaintiff’s injury here as at least falling under the most severe of the “Moderate to minor leg injuries”, with damages in the range of S$10,000 to S$15,000. The description states:

> Fractures where there are some residual disabilities such as a defective gait, a limp, discomfort… . The disabilities are unlikely to resolve even in the long run.

47     I consider the award of S$15,000 for this injury as fair and appropriate, and award the Plaintiff the same.

#### Right Proximal Tibia (Knee) Fractures

48     As was with the Plaintiff’s proximal femur, so it is with his proximal tibia, according to Dr Victor Seah: it is better before it gets worse. The report of 25 September 2013 recorded the Plaintiff as having “full range of motion in his right knee…”[^47] but the report of 30 December 2014 recorded a permanent disability of 4%.[^48] The earlier-referred-to limp was of course still present.

49     Dr Lee Soon Tai, on the other hand, reported that the Plaintiff had full flexion of his right knee.[^49] Once again, he also acknowledged that the Plaintiff had “residual numbing pain”.[^50] However, he maintained his medical view that “\[n\]umbing pain on the leg, just below the knee, that will not stop him from achieving flexion of the knee without pain.”[^51] In saying this, whilst he agrees that “the right tibia and right knee are very close”,[^52] and that “\[t\]he knee is on top of the tibia, and so, … it is connected directly”[^53], Dr Lee insisted that the “numbing pain at the anterolateral aspect of \[the Plaintiff’s\] right proximal tibia”[^54] would not affect the flexion of the knee.

50     Plaintiff Counsel made the argument that the knee and the proximal tibia are “too close for a reasonable person to differentiate the source of pain”.[^55] I have to admit that I would have to agree with this point. With his medical training, Dr Lee would be able to differentiate the pain source if it were on him. However, given the proximity of the knee and the tibia and a numbing pain at that, it would be difficult for a layman to differentiate. I further accept that when the Plaintiff pointed to the numbing pain at the anterolateral aspect of his proximal right tibia at Fig. 6 at PD58, it was around the knee region.

51     The above being the case, and with Dr Victor Seah reporting that there is a small percentage of permanent incapacity, and Dr Lee Soon Tai acknowledging that there is residual pain, I have found it more convincing that the knee flexion is more likely to be 0° - 130° than its full range of 150°, as reported by Dr Lee.

52     From this, Plaintiff Counsel submitted an award of S$12,000, whilst Defence Counsel again relied on the Guidelines at “Moderate to minor leg injuries”[^56] for a range of S$6,000 to S$10,000. In asking for S$12,000, Plaintiff Counsel cited the case of _Ganesan A/L Govindaraj v Ravi A/L Mariappen & Another_ Suit No. 460 of 2008. However, _Ganesan_’s case concerns an open fracture. There is no open fracture in the present case.

53     Following the Guidelines at page 50, at paragraph A.(ii), I accept Defence Counsel’s submission that this right proximal tibia fracture is a moderate to minor leg injury. In view of the slight permanent incapacity, an award of S$10,000 would be the reasonable amount to award.

#### Loss of Consciousness

54     The medical experts on both sides agree that there was at least one episode of the Plaintiff losing consciousness. The duration of the Plaintiff’s being unconscious was not raised as an issue. It was recorded in Psychologist Ms Khoo Sue Anne’s report[^57] that the Plaintiff informed her that “he suffered a loss of consciousness and only awoke at the hospital’s intensive care unit the following morning”.[^58]

55     By the case authority of _Woon Yok Moy nee Teow Yok Moy v Ang Lay Tin & Another_ DC Suit No. 559 of 2004, I am guided to award S$1,500 for this head of claim.

#### Post-Concussion Syndrome (Giddiness) and Amnesia

56     Plaintiff Counsel suggested that given how the accident happened – right before the Plaintiff’s eyes – Plaintiff should have seen what happened, yet, he was unable to recollect. Quite clearly therefore, Plaintiff Counsel submits that the Plaintiff was suffering from amnesia and to be compensated an amount of S$4,000. As there is no evidence brought forth that should persuade me to discount A/P Loh’s report, by the report, I should consider that the Plaintiff has proven this head on a balance of probabilities.

57     With regard to the quantum of award, there is little under this head for the Court to go on as there was no oral examination on this injury. This Court is also reluctant to rely on the case of _Ong Zern Chern Philip v Wong Siang Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 256</span> which Plaintiff Counsel cited. In _Ong_’s case, the parties, for whatever reasons, agreed on the sum of S$5,000 for retrograde amnesia with headache, which is quite different from the Plaintiff’s symptom of amnesia. I prefer to calibrate the damages here with reference to the Guidelines under Minor Head Injury.[^59]

58     Under the abovementioned head of claim, the award range is S$1,000 to S$6,000. The quantum to be awarded along this range would depend on –

> “(i)  the extent of the initial injury;

> (ii)  the recovery period; and

> (iii)  whether there are any residual symptoms, _e.g._, headache, giddiness, nausea, _etc._, and the extent of the same.”[^60]

59     “Stable head injury with or without loss of consciousness (full recovery within a few weeks” was prescribed at a range of S$2,000 to S$3,000. In view of this, I consider the Plaintiff’s submission at S$4,000 as reasonable for the Plaintiff’s post-concussion syndrome of giddiness and amnesia.

#### Psychiatry: ‘Dr Christopher Cheok v Dr Lionel Lim’

60     With regard to the Plaintiff’s psychiatric condition, the Plaintiff relies on the evidence of Dr Christopher Cheok, whilst the Defence had engaged Dr Lionel Lim to review the Plaintiff. Plaintiff Counsel has set out their evidence in a table[^61] which I thought would be helpful to reproduce here (with some modification to the format of presentation and the order of Dr Lionel Lim’s evidence, to correspond with Dr Christopher Cheok’s, for an easier comparison). I also included Dr Lionel Lim’s opinion on the Plaintiff’s psychiatric condition for the future. (Portions below in italics are mine and not part of Plaintiff Counsel’s table.) Plaintiff Counsel had also referred to this in a part of his Closing Submissions subsequent to the presentation of the table[^62]:

#### Nightmares, Flashbacks and Increased Risk of Psychiatric Disorders

61     It is not in issue that the Plaintiff was not diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”). However, from reading the reports, there is ample evidence from the doctors that the Plaintiff had been adversely affected mentally by the incident, in that he was no longer what he used to be prior to the incident.

62     Defence Counsel took the cue from Dr Lionel Lim’s report and drew a bold distinction of what the Plaintiff’s nightmares and flashbacks were about: that they were related to “his stay in hospital”,[^63] and not the incident. However, I am of the view that, with all due respect, this part of Dr Lionel Lim’s report comes across to me as contrived and an attempt to play down what the Plaintiff was going through, by highlighting the subject of his flashback and nightmare. It would not be far-fetched to reason that, given that the Plaintiff was also diagnosed with amnesia, that he would not be able to recall the accident and so bring it to surface in his nightmares. I find it more likely than not that this was a result of the Plaintiff having gone through the horror of the incident.

63     In awarding the claim, I took guidance from the Guidelines for General Psychiatric Disorders and PTSD as there is no category which fits the Plaintiff’s particular injury. In doing so, I consider the description of the symptoms rather than what the disorder is called.

64     Under PTSD, some of the symptoms include, _inter alia_, “recurrent flashbacks; \[and\] persistent nightmares” which were what our Plaintiff was diagnosed to have suffered from. Having said that, I am well aware that Dr Christopher Cheok had said in unequivocal terms that the Plaintiff did not have PTSD.[^64] So, I emphasise that I’m merely using these as guideposts.

65     I zoomed down to consider the following:

> (a)     General Psychiatric Disorder – Minor; with a range of S$1,000 to S$3,000;

> (b)     PTSD – Minor; with full recovery within 1 to 2 years with minor symptoms still persisting, at a range of S$2,000 to S$4,000; and

> (c)     PTSD – Moderate, with symptoms persisting on a long-term basis; but able to cope with demands of daily life, and with a range of S$4,000 to S$10,000.

66     Plaintiff Counsel had urged the Court to award the sum of S$6,000 with the case of _Zubaida Bte Hussain & Ors v Tan Sze Joo_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 207</span> whilst Defence Counsel shows scepticism that the Plaintiff’s condition related to the incident, and so, submitted a concessionary sum of S$500.

67     In _Zubaida_’s case, the Court had awarded the sum of S$6,000 as there was a finding that her emotional state following a car accident exacerbated her grief and depression of her mother’s death which followed shortly after. In the present case, whilst Dr Christopher Cheok was of the view that “previous incidents predispose the person to PTSD in future accidents”[^65] and that “being a \[prime mover\] driver, \[the Plaintiff\] does stand the risk of having another accident”[^66], the Plaintiff seems unaffected by the risks. He has gone back to driving his prime mover, and he chose not to see a psychotherapist or psychiatrist.[^67] So, an increased risk of psychiatric disorder? I am unable to see that.

68     For his suffering nightmares and flashbacks, and taking guidance from the Guidelines, I consider that the Plaintiff’s symptoms fall within the ranges in the Guidelines, and award the sum of S$3,500.

#### Permanent Cognitive Impairment

69     After examining the Plaintiff, Dr Christopher Cheok reported that the Plaintiff has cognitive impairment.[^68] The Court surmised that Dr Lionel Lim did not dispute that when he, in expressing his opinion,[^69] had referred to Ms Khoo Sue Anne’s psychiatry report where she had reported that the Plaintiff has “(i) deterioration in his intellectual functioning \[and\] (ii) the affected domains were “his attention and speed of information processing, memory and learning, visuospatial/constructional abilities, sematic fluency and aspects of his executive functioning”…”.[^70] Ms Khoo Sue Anne was a Principal Clinical Psychologist at KTPH. She had examined the Plaintiff on 27 March 2014 when the Plaintiff was referred to her for neuropsychological assessment.[^71]

70     Like Plaintiff Counsel, I preferred Dr Christopher Cheok’s evidence over Dr Lionel Lim’s for the following reasons:

> (a)     As submitted by Plaintiff Counsel, Dr Cheok’s evidence was based on CT scans and 7 psychological tests done by the KTPH team, whilst Dr Lionel Lim had relied on Ms Khoo Sue Anne’s report. In _Wong Meng Cheong & Anor v Ling Ai Wah & Anor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 549</span> the High Court made it clear that in the face of conflicting evidence, “it was only correct for a fact-finder to rely more heavily on the objective medical evidence”.[^72]

> (b)     It is noted that both Dr Cheok and Dr Lim performed a series of tests on the Plaintiff. Some of the common tests included his orientation to time and place,[^73] his short-term and long-term memory,[^74] his visual-spatial abilities, language functioning, and other tests.[^75] However, Dr Cheok also administered the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) on the Plaintiff. This test was to “distinguish (_sic;_ “discriminating”[^76]) between _bona fide_ memory impairment and malingering”.[^77] However, oddly, Dr Lim’s conclusion from the tests was that the Plaintiff was able to learn and retain information when, from the Plaintiff’s near-perfect score of the 2nd run of the test, it showed that the Plaintiff was not malingering at all. That he was not malingering should therefore highlight that the Plaintiff was honestly suffering cognitive impairment. Plaintiff Counsel submitted that Dr Lim’s report was unreliable for his being partial.[^78] Whatever the reason for his omitting this fact, I would just say that Dr Lim’s report is unreliable.

> (c)     From the 2 doctors’ descriptions of the tests that they administered on the Plaintiff, I noted that Dr Lionel Lim’s tests were simple and there was no time-restriction in that the Plaintiff could take as long as he needed to, to arrive at the answer.[^79] It is noted that in doing that, the Plaintiff was able to give most of the answers correctly. For orientation to time, place and person, the Plaintiff was asked the date and time which he responded by looking at his watch.[^80] For short-term memory tests, he was asked to recall a 4-digit number 3 minutes later, and for long-term, he was asked the date of his birth, his address and telephone number.[^81] He was also put through simple mathematics of addition and subtraction. From these tests, Dr Lim concluded that the Plaintiff was able to function cognitively. In contrast, from tests administered to the Plaintiff, Dr Cheok’s conclusion was that the Plaintiff’s “\[IQ\] was below what is predicted by his educational level[^82] and his processing speed was extremely low, and his attention span was also very low.”[^83] With the low standard or threshold required of the person being tested by Dr Lim’s tests, I have found the conclusion drawn therefrom to be doubtful. For example, if the Plaintiff took an unreasonably long time to process an information or to work out a mathematical equation, I should think that that would affect his ability to function cognitively. However, it appears that these are inconsequential – and so not captured – in Dr Lim’s tests.

For these reasons, I regret that I was unable to accept Dr Lim’s medical report in these aspects and have preferred Dr Cheok’s.

71     However, I do take Dr Lionel Lim’s point that driving a prime mover requires certain disciplines of the mind and it appears that the Plaintiff was able to handle it. He was able to drive the prime mover for the next 4 years and more after the accident, without any reported incident. That is remarkable for someone who is alleged to have permanent cognitive impairment.

72     My finding from the above is that the Plaintiff suffers permanent cognitive impairment, but it is neither to the extent suggested by Dr Cheok nor as slight an extent as suggested by Dr Lim. While the Plaintiff can still operate a prime mover, it did not mean that he did not suffer a mental setback. The finding was in fact that his “pre-morbid general intellectual capacity was within the _High Average_ range and within the top 25% of his cohort… current intellectual functioning was significantly depressed – all below 30% of age-matched peers and ranging from _Extremely Low_ to _Average_ range.”[^84] (Italics are original.)

73     Although Defence Counsel urged the Court on an award of S$5,000, this amount is inappropriate for the findings that this Court has made. In contrast, Plaintiff Counsel submits the case authority of _Bhoj Bahadur Sunuwar v Teo Kwang Ang_ High Court Suit 687 of 2007 where an award of S$25,000 was ordered. I looked at the types of injury sustained in _Bhoj_’s case and considered particularly the head injuries there. It is definitely more severe than in our Plaintiff’s case. I therefore allow the award at slightly less than that awarded in _Bhoj Bahadur_’s case. The award here is to be S$20,000.

#### Head-Face & Head-Eye Injuries

##### Component or global approach

74     Defence Counsel had asked that these injuries enumerated above be awarded on a global basis as they are overlapping injuries.[^85]

75     Defence Counsel had set out the medical opinions of Dr Leikha Gopal[^86], Dr Eugene Poh[^87] and even Dr Lee Soon Tai’s report[^88] in his Closing Submissions.[^89] There is no explanation of why he did that, save, perhaps that these medical opinions had made references to these injuries in general terms? Defence Counsel then submitted “that the appropriate award for facial injuries should be a global sum of S$15,000.” There is therefore no submissions of the amounts to be awarded for the individual heads of claim for the head-face and head-eye injuries.

76     Plaintiff Counsel, on the other hand, submitted that “the head injuries should be broken up into their components, awarded separately and then sum up the awards.”[^90] The authority for this approach is the case of _Azmi bin Ahmad v Lee Po Hoon_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 5</span> where the Court awarded separately for head injury (double vision, _etc._), facial lacerations, facial fractures, sinusitis, periorbital haemotoma, and head oedema.

77     This Court recognises that there may be some overlap. For example, treatment of the right orbital floor and walls and treating the mild enophthalmos on the right eye, which has to do with displacement of the eyeball. However, it considers that the more appropriate approach to the claims here would be on a component approach. This is in view of the severity of each injury and the fact that the injuries are rather different, and also taking guidance from _Azmi_’s case where the Court had also awarded the claims on a component basis. Of course adjustments can be made, if necessary, to reflect an appropriate award.

#### Comminuted Facial Fractures with Oral and Maxillo Trauma Involving \[Various Part of the Face, Jaw, Etc.\]

78     Dr Eugene Poh’s medical report sets out the comminuted facial fractures that the Plaintiff sustained as a result of the accident. These include right fronto-zygomatic suture, right orbital floor and walls, right malar, right zygomatic-maxillary buttress, bilateral maxillary sinus wall, right angle of jaw, upper right posterior dento-alveolar frachtures involving teeth #16 and #17, and left mandible condylar neck.

79     In _Azmi_’s case, on appeal, the High Court awarded the Plaintiff S$45,000 for facial fractures which included fractures of bilateral naso-ethnoidal, fracture of left zugomatic, fracture of left orbital with blowout component, and bilateral maxillac fractures. Those were awarded apart from other facial lacerations, scars, nerve damage on face, and other injuries sustained on the face and nasal bone.

80     In our present case, the Plaintiff’s injuries are, regrettably, comparable with the Plaintiff of _Azmi_’s case. I am of the view that S$45,000 under these circumstances is not inconsistent. This is, of course, subject to any adjustments later on.

#### Permanent Diminished Sensation over the Right Side of Face

81     For this injury, I agree with Plaintiff’s submission for an amount of S$4,000. The Plaintiff here suffers “a 50% diminished sensation over the right side of his face”.[^91] Plaintiff Counsel cited _Azmi_’s case as authority. For loss of sensation in cheek in _Azmi_’s case, the Court awarded him S$20,000, however Plaintiff Counsel was of the view that since “other facial injuries were included in this figure, we submit S$4,000…”.[^92]

#### Left Facial Nerve Paralysis

82     Regarding the left facial nerve paralysis, Plaintiff Counsel had again calibrated the amount from _Azmi_’s case. Plaintiff Counsel recognised that the S$20,000 in _Azmi_’s case is constituted by a few components. One of these was the unevenness or lack of symmetry in face which this Court is of the view would constitute the bulk of the S$20,000, together with the scarring and other obvious injuries to the face. In view of that, although there is no breakdown in that case, it would be reasonable to apportion only a small component of the damages to the nerve paralysis. Plaintiff Counsel therefore submitted for an award of S$3,000. I consider S$2,000 to be the more reasonable amount in the scheme of things.

#### Mild Enophthalmos on the Right Eye (Displacement of Eyeball)

83     Despite the time lapse between the relevant examination of 4 February 2013[^93] and Dr Lee Soon Tai’s on 22 December 2016, enophthalmos of the right eye was still observed at the 2016 examination almost 4 years later. This therefore does not appear to be a condition that would disappear or heal with time, given that it was still present after 46 months.

84     I agree with Plaintiff Counsel that it would be a misnomer to categorise this condition as “Transient eye injur\[y\]”[^94] under the Guidelines. Whilst there is no description that fits the Plaintiff’s condition squarely, the best option would be to take guidance from “Minor eye injuries” in the Guidelines.[^95] The awards range for this category is S$4,000 to S$7,000. S$4,000 would be an appropriate damages amount.

#### Adjustments to Amounts of Award?

85     As mentioned earlier,[^96] for the head-face and head-eye injuries, Defence Counsel had submitted that they should be treated using the global approach. I took the position that, for various reasons, including the precedent case of _Azmi_, it would be equitable to take the components approach with these injuries. However, I did also mention that adjustments might be made.

86     Having awarded the parties the amounts on a component basis, I consider that a slight adjustment might be made to the overall award on this group of injuries. I therefore adjust downwards, the award of comminuted facial fractures from S$45,000 (following _Azmi_’s case where the same amount was awarded) to S$42,500, taking into account also the overall injury that the Plaintiff sustained, compared with _Azmi_’s, and their particular disabilities.

#### Multiple Scarring

87     There is a total of 5 scars noted on the Plaintiff’s body. I draw the summary from Defence Counsel’s Closing Submissions: [^97]

> (a)     a healed 4cm incision scar at the back of his ear;

> (b)     a healed 12cm incision scar over the right radius;

> (c)     a healed 6cm incision scar over the base of the left thumb;

> (d)     healed incision scars over the left hip (4cm) and thigh (5cm); and

> (e)     a healed 14.5cm incision scar at the proximal right tibia.

88     Plaintiff Counsel relied on the case of _Lim Junkai (Lin Jun Kai) v Orientus Country Clubs & Resorts Pte Ltd_ DC Suit No. 1010 of 2011 and submitted for a figure of S$10,000 for the multiple scarrings visible on the Plaintiff. It is unclear whether the Defence was submitting a figure of S$8,000 or S$8,500 as the figure in the body of their submission was S$8,000, whilst their summary at page 35 of its Closing Submissions state S$8,500.

89     The Court takes cognisance that some of the scars are not in prominent areas, for example, the two 4 centimetre scars at the back of the left ear and the other over the left hip and thigh. While the Court had awarded S$10,000 for multiple scarring in _Lim Junkai_’s case, it did not escape the Court that _Lim Junkai_ suffered more scars than our Plaintiff. Further, _Lim_ was also only 21 years old at that time and he was a salesman. The scars would no doubt have a greater impact on a younger man than on our Plaintiff who is more senior and who is a prime mover driver.

90     Taking these into consideration as well as the award range of S$5,000 to S$15,000 in the Guidelines for multiple scars,[^98] I consider S$8,500 to be a fair amount of award for the Plaintiff’s multiple scarring.

#### 5 Lost Teeth and 3 Mobile Teeth

91     Regarding the Plaintiff’s 5 lost teeth, both parties had agreed that S$2,500 per lost tooth was reasonable. This amounts to S$12,500. For the Plaintiff’s 3 mobile teeth, Plaintiff Counsel had submitted a figure of S$2,000 per mobile tooth, whilst Defence Counsel had submitted a figure of S$500.

92     The Guidelines provide for damages for a lost tooth to start from S$1,500.[^99] Taking guidance therefrom, for each of the Plaintiff’s mobile tooth which is still intact but loose, I award the amount of S$1,000. In awarding this amount, I take into account the testimony of Dr Poh who confirmed that the Plaintiff is unlikely to replace his mobile tooth or to remove the wire and titanium plates in his mouth or to convert to using implants from dentures. The Plaintiff himself also confirmed the same.

93     The total amount for the 5 lost teeth and 3 mobile teeth is therefore S$15,500 (_i.e._, S$2,500\*5 + S$1,000\*3 = S$15,500).

#### Permanent Loss of Sense of Smell

94     Despite what was stated in the Joint Opening Statement by the Defence Counsel, Counsel for Plaintiff and Defendant have submitted for this loss of sense to be treated discretely from the loss of sense of taste. There is therefore no issue whether the loss of the particular senses should be treated on component or global basis. Where this Court is concerned, I also consider the component approach the more suitable for this case, for the same reasons as was stated in _Tan Yu Min Winston (by his next friend Tan Cheng Tong) v Uni-Fruitveg Pte. Ltd._ 4 SLR(R) 825 at paras 16-17.

95     According to Dr Tan Kar-Su’s evidence when on the stand, brain scans, endoscopy and tests showed the Plaintiff to suffer a smell disorder. However, it was acknowledged by the doctor that “regarding the degree of the impact, we do not have a quantitative objective test.”[^100] That required a scanning of the brain and even today, that test is “still experimental and not the general standard of care”, as Dr Tan had told the Court.[^101] He also reported that this problem is “likely permanent”.[^102] Dr Tan’s basis for that is because nerve injury such as the one in issue generally has a recovery period of 6 months to 1 year. Beyond that, the potential for recovery is “unlikely”.[^103] So, while the medical expert has spoken and that the injury is lilkely permanent, there is no evidence of the extent of the Plaintiff’s loss of this sense.

96     It is to be borne in mind that the burden of proof is on the Plaintiff. Despite that, Plaintiff Counsel submitted an amount of S$16,000 as award. His basis is the case authority of _Teng Kui Thai & Anor v Goh Chwee Kim_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] SGHC 219</span>. In _Teng_’s case, there was there was little information on the extent of the Plaintiff’s loss of smell. It is also noted that the Plaintiff in that case, although 26 years old, was a seamstress, and not in a vocation where her sense of smell was her ‘tool’. So these are, in our present case too. As the High Court considered it just to award her the amount of S$16,000, for the present case, given the age of our Plaintiff, the award should be lesser. Defence Counsel had submitted an award of S$7,000 on the basis that the doctor’s diagnosis was very much based on what the Plaintiff told him and that the test was “highly subjective and can lead to over exaggeration by the patient” and has “potentially \[a\] large margin of error”.[^104]

97     In my judgment, an award of S$15,000 would be fair for the Plaintiff’s permanent loss of sense of smell. This is taking into consideration that under the Guidelines, S$5,000 would be the starting range where the loss of smell is temporary.[^105] This is in fact a generous consideration in view of the case of _Errol Sanath Nanayakara v Juan Badathuruge Buddila_ Suit No. 312 of 1996, where, for 3½ months’ loss of sense of smell, the Plaintiff there was awarded only S$1,500.

#### Permanent Loss of Sense of Taste

98     In Dr Eugene Poh’s report of 21 February 2014, he had referred to the Plaintiff having “yet to regain his sense of taste of the right side of the tongue”.[^106] Although reference was made to Dr Poh’s examining the Plaintiff on 3 May 2013 – just 3 months after the accident – if there was any issue of Dr Poh’s statement being prematurely made, it was clear from the same report that the Plaintiff was still seeing Dr Poh on a regular basis more than 1 year after the accident.

99     From these references therefore, it appears that any loss of the sense of taste for the Plaintiff is therefore only on the right side of the Plaintiff’s tongue.

100    Regarding the loss of sense of taste, Plaintiff Counsel submitted a figure of S$15,000 whilst Defence Counsel submitted S$6,000.

101    Again taking reference from the Guidelines which prescribes the range of S$5,000 to S$15,000,[^107] I consider an award of S$10,000 to be a fair amount, taking into consideration that the loss is only to one side of the mouth, but the loss is nevertheless permanent.

#### Loss of Amenities?

102    Plaintiff Counsel further submitted that “\[t\]he composite effect of both permanent losses of smell and taste is the permanent inability to enjoy life to its fullest, i.e., loss of amenities.” (Emphasis is Plaintiff Counsel’s.)[^108] It is not in dispute that the Plaintiff had “a strong passion for cooking and experimenting with food”.[^109] He also orally testified that before the accident, he had borrowed S$40,000 from a friend to start a food project.[^110]

103    In _Errol_’s case (earlier referred to) where the Plaintiff had also lost his sense of smell, the Court awarded him loss of amenities of S$3,000. Given that the Plaintiff here has lost both senses of smell and taste, Plaintiff Counsel submitted for an amount of S$8,000. There was no submission from the Defence Counsel on this point.

104    I would allow for the damages for loss of amenities. As alluded to by Plaintiff Counsel, it is also my view that the composite adverse effect of the loss of smell and the impaired sense of taste on the quality of life is greater than the sum of the loss of each of these senses on the quality of life. However, I am careful that in doing this, I should avoid doubly awarding for the injuries sustained. I should also add that I had not given any uplift in my earlier considerations of the two permanent losses of smell and taste.

105    Cognisant of the Plaintiff’s passion for food[^111] and also his evidence that he was serious enough about food to have borrowed S$40,000 – which is not a small sum – from a friend for it,[^112] it would be, that his permanent loss of smell and taste would adversely impact on this venture. I noticed that his connection with food was even noted by Ms Khoo Sue Anne in her report of 3 April 2014 where she alluded to his biscuit factory venture in Malaysia and his being in the food industry. However, I do not consider that a fair award under this head would be S$8,000 as submitted by Plaintiff Counsel.

106    For total loss of taste and smell, the award prescribed in the Guidelines is “\[i\]n the region of S$30,000”. For “\[t\]otal loss of smell and significant loss of taste”, the award is in the range of $25,000 to S$30,000. In awarding these amounts, I should think that the Courts would have taken into consideration the effects of losing both these senses, which is essentially what this head of claim seeks to achieve. Hence, for the loss of amenities, I consider an amount of S$3,000 to be a fair amount for the present case.

### B.   LOSS OF EARNING CAPACITY

107    In the Joint Opening Statement, the Plaintiff had submitted for an amount of S$23,000 for loss of earning capacity. However, this was amended to S$76,881.42. The Plaintiff applied the approach used in the case of _Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin & Another & Another Appeal <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 80</span>_.

108    Before the case can be applied, however, as reminded by the case of _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ \[2010\] 3 SLF 587, this Court must be satisfied that –

> (a)     the Plaintiff risks losing his current employment; and

> (b)     the Plaintiff will be at a disadvantage in the market place when he looks for alternative employment because of his injuries.

109    In the present case, the Plaintiff returned to work on 28 June 2013.[^113] During his cross-examination, the Plaintiff explained his job situation regarding the high turnover of prime-mover drivers in his company: [^114]

>   
| 

PW1:

 | 

The job turnover rate very high, but I stayed on, 6½ years already. Only 5% stay on for so long. The rest would have left.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

So, you were saying that the nature of the job is such that only 5% stayed on in the job?

 |
| 

PW1:

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

DC:

 | 

So, that being the case, the employer would be happy to employ you as long as you stay on in the job?

 |
| 

PW1:

 | 

Yes, that’s why the employer awards the worker S$200 extra every month. Most will leave after 6 months. For senior driver, it is S$200. I am considered as senior. …

 |

  
  

110    Contrary to the picture that Plaintiff Counsel paints, from the Plaintiff himself, the message that this Court received was that the Plaintiff was much sought after. Given the high turnover of prime mover drivers in the industry, a person such as the Plaintiff would be highly valued, particularly since, from the Plaintiff’s testimony, the high turnover of workers was due to the workers’ leaving rather than the company asking them to leave. It was also the Plaintiff’s testimony that his employer-company wanted him to return to work as soon as possible. After all, there were only so few workers around who qualify to operate a prime mover. I am therefore unable to appreciate that the Plaintiff suffers a high risk of losing his present job.

111    Further, despite his injuries and having to operate the prime mover, once the prime mover driver is in his seat, there is very little need for his leg movement, save that short distance to operate any gear. I therefore do not see how the Plaintiff’s injury would put him at a disadvantage in the market place. Also, the fact that the Plaintiff has been doing this since 28 June 2013 to 15 November 2018 (when Plaintiff came to testify before the Court) is testimony to his ability to retain his employment.

112    Having stated my position above, I should add that whilst I do accept that a worker’s salary may increase over time, that should not disqualify him from being awarded damages for loss of earning capacity. (See: _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span>; and _Neo Kim Seng v Clough Petrosea Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 413</span>.)

113    Despite my holding above, I nevertheless consider that the Plaintiff should be nominally awarded under this head. Low risk of losing his employment does not mean that there is absolutely no risk. All things being equal, if the company has to issue ‘the pink slip’ to its workers, the Plaintiff, having some disabilities, might be amongst the first to be asked to leave. Even the Defence Counsel recognised this when he submitted the sum of S$10,000 to be awarded to the Plaintiff under this head. Given the Plaintiff’s age and now his disability also, I award the Plaintiff the amount of S$20,000 under this head.

### C.   FUTURE MEDICAL EXPENSES

114    Plaintiff Counsel claims future medical expenses for dental treatments and psychiatric help and submits a total sum of S$35,000; S$32,000 for the cost of dental implants for 8 teeth (5 lost teeth which are presently replaced by dentures and 3 mobile teeth) at S$4,000 each, and S$3,000 for future psychiatric disorders. The burden is of course on the Plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that these are likely to be necessary in the future.

115    In support of this claim, Plaintiff Counsel highlighted the evidence of the doctors: that the Plaintiff was more at risk than before of psychiatric disorders, for example, or PTSD. Also, and what possible dental treatments the Plaintiff can undergo in the future. The latter includes replacing the missing teeth and mobile teeth with dental implants. Evidence was also cited, about the less than perfect condition of the Plaintiff’s physical state: how his face was pulling, or how irritating the plate below the Plaintiff’s eye was, or how he felt when scolded with vulgar words.

116    While all these may be good information, there is no evidence before me that the Plaintiff would indeed be going for them. Any evidence that the Plaintiff intends to go for such treatment is a relevant consideration. As it is, the Plaintiff was presently already suffering these discomforts. Yet, there is nothing from the Plaintiff that informs the court that he intends to seek treatment, but was hampered only by the lack of funds. It is in fact noted that whilst his medical subsidy ended in October 2014, his last visit to Dr Eugene Poh (Dental) was in January 2014. His last visit to Dr Christopher Cheok (Psychiatrist) was also many months before the subsidy stopped. There is nothing in evidence that he intends to re-visit these doctors as soon as he comes into funds, as was suggested by Plaintiff Counsel. There is nothing in evidence also that he has found out what his options are, which fact would indicate to this Court that he intends to seek treatment, but hampered by a lack of funds.

117    I therefore agree with Defence Counsel that the Plaintiff is unlikely to follow up with further treatment for his condition, whether or not he comes into funds. Given my finding on this, and, in view of the 2 areas – dental and psychiatry - that Plaintiff Counsel had submitted, I award the Plaintiff only nominally, the sum of S$15,000, and these would be more for maintenance of the treatment he had received, and not new future medical treatments.

### D.   SPECIAL DAMAGES

### Medical Expenses; Medishield Considerations

118    The Plaintiff claims S$24,174.95 for his medical expenses. These are supported by the medical invoices. The Defendant argues against the amounts paid by Medishield.

119    I have looked at and considered the case of _Hazwani bte Amin v Chia Heok Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCR 2</span> which was cited by Plaintiff Counsel. In _Hazwani_’s case, the Assistant Registrar considered Regulation 15(1) of the Medishield Life Scheme Regulations 2015. To paraphrase and using the words of the learned Assistant Registrar in that case: “a beneficiary under the Medishield Life Scheme who obtains compensation from a third party in respect of any medical expenses which were paid for by Medishield is statutorily obligated to reimburse the Medishield Life Fund”.[^115] This Regulation 15(1) is still in operation and applicable today.

120    From the amount that the Plaintiff would get from the Defendant therefore, the Plaintiff would have to reimburse into the Medishield Fund. It cannot be that the Plaintiff should be out of his own pocket to do that. Hence, the amount first paid by Medishield is therefore to be included in the amount from the Defendant and reimbursed to the Plaintiff.

121    The Plaintiff has submitted a claim of an amount of S$24,174.95. The Defendant submits that the Plaintiff is entitled to a sum of S$14,192.21, and that the Medishield amount is S$10,637.83, that is, a total amount of S$24,830.04.

122    I am allowing the claim for medical expenses at S$24,174.95 for the reasons above given.

### Transport

123    On transport expenses, I consider that the Plaintiff Counsel has been reasonable in his submission of the amount of S$735.00. This is despite the absence of invoices or receipts supporting the claim, save for two invoices of ambulance services totalling S$135.00.

124    Taking into account the number of visits that the Plaintiff was very likely to have made to the hospitals and for his medical reviews from the number of medical invoices, I agree that 30 trips – excluding the trips supported by invoices – is not unreasonable. I also see no reason to depart from the case of _Tan Hun Boon v Rui Feng Travel Pte Ltd & Another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 244</span> where S$20.00 was awarded for each to-and-fro trip despite the absence of receipts, or mode of transport. Plaintiff Counsel’s submission is also appropriately conservative, which was an important consideration in _Tan Hun Boon_’s case.

125    I therefore award the amount S$735.00 for transport.

## SUMMARY OF THE AWARDS & COSTS
