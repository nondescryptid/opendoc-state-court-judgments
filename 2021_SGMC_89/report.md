## Submissions on Sentence

4       It was not disputed that the “two-step sentencing bands” approach (the “_Kunasekaran_ framework”) laid down in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somsundara v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“Kunasekaran”)_ was applicable to the present case. Accordingly, I proceeded to determine which was the applicable sentencing band by having regard to the offence-specific factors and thereafter calibrate the appropriate sentence for the Accused, having regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the Accused.

5       The Prosecution submitted that applying the _Kunasekaran_ framework, the Accused’s offending acts should be in the lower range of Band 2. In this respect, considering the moderate degree of sexual exploitation, and the presence of a number of other offence-specific factors, the Prosecution submitted for an indicative starting range of 5 – 8 months’ imprisonment.

6       In relation to the offender-specific factors, the Prosecution submitted that there were no mitigating factors in the present case. It was highlighted that the Accused had not shown any remorse.

7       In the circumstances, the Prosecution submitted for a 6 months’ imprisonment.

8       The Defence submitted that the custodial threshold was not crossed and urged the court to impose a fine of $5,000.

9       Counsel submitted that the present case fell within Band 1 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework. It was contended that the touch was fleeting, there was no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion of the private parts. It was submitted that the Accused never made contact with the Complainant’s body – only her dress.

10     Counsel also contended that no weight should be placed on the Victim impact statement.

11     The defence also submitted that there were no significant aggravating factors. The Accused disagreed that his defence spurious. It was contended that the Accused conducted his defence in an efficient manner and should not be penalized for claiming trial.

## Sentencing Considerations

12     Having regard to the _Kunasekaran_ framework, I was of the view that a custodial sentence was warranted and appropriate.

13     Firstly, I considered the offence-specific factors. In this respect, I looked into the degree of sexual exploitation. With the greatest respect, I rejected the Defence’s submission that the Accused had not touched the groin area of the Victim. I found that the Accused had used his right hand to swipe the Victim’s groin area twice over the Victim’s dress[^1]. It was a brief 2 quick swipes that lasted only for seconds[^2]. The Victim had also demonstrated how the Accused had done it and also confirmed that she could feel the Accused’s swipes on the front part of her groin area over her dress[^3]. Clearly there was no skin-on-skin contact and it was a fleeting touch.

14     Next, I examined the circumstances of the offence. There was no premeditation. It happened when the Accused noted the Victim was wearing a dress and he commented that it was “so short” immediately before the offending act. The offence took place in the workplace. When the Accused committed the offence, he was smiling. I agreed with the Prosecution that such remark by the Accused and his demeanour were aggravating.

15     The Accused was a director of the Victim’s company. Although he was not the Victim’s direct supervisor, he was clearly her superior. Being her superior and the fact that the offence was committed in the workplace during office hours[^4], these, in my view, warranted the consideration of deterrence. At the material time, the Accused had asked the Victim to update the whiteboard and he exploited the situation to commit the offence. He went to the Victim, commented about her dress and used his right hand to quick swipe the Victim’s groin area twice over the Victim’s dress. The Accused had clearly abused his position. This was an aggravating factor[^5].

16     Another aggravating factor was the fact that the Accused attempted to evade detection by placating the Victim with an apology and asked for the Victim to delete the WhatsApp message Exhibit P2.

17     As regards the harm caused, Prosecution tendered the Victim Impact Statement(“VIS”). The Victim was also cross-examined by the Defence on the VIS. In my view, it was natural for any Victim to have suffered some form of psychological impact as a result of the molestation. In fact, immediately after the incident, the victim ran out of the office in fright and cried. Her demeanour was corroborated by PW2.

18     Considering the degree of sexual exploitation, the harm caused to the Victim was likely to be not severe given the fact that the Accused had continued to accept rides from the Accused. On the other hand, I rejected the allegation of financial loss as stated in the VIS. I accepted the Defence’s submission that the Victim was not jobless for about 8 months and had no financial support. The Victim, when questioned on her VIS, admitted that she was not jobless and without financial support.

## Band 2

19     Having considered the offence-specific factors, I found the offence fell at the lower end of band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework.

## Offender-specific factors

20     In my view, there was no mitigating factor. I also found that there was no significant aggravating factor. The Accused had no relevant antecedents or charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Sentencing Precedents

21     I considered the relevant sentencing precedents tendered by the parties.

22     The case of _Soh Yang Tick v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 209</span>_ (“_Soh Yang Tick_”), relied on by the Defence was distinguishable on the facts. In _Soh Yang Tick_, the offender was convicted for using his hand to hit the buttock of the victim. In the present case, it involved the Victim’s groin area. In any event, _Soh Yang Tick_ was decided pre-_Kunasekaran_.

23     In _Kunasekaran_, the offender was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for touching the groin area from outside the skirt of a 14 years old schoolgirl on a bus.

24     In _PP v Goh Eng Chin <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 17</span>_ (“_Goh Eng Chin”)_, the offender faced 4 charges under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code. One of these charges was for putting the offender’s head on the victim’s pubic region, touching her thigh and hugging her. The offender was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for this charge.

## Conclusion

25     I was of the view that the present case was not as egregious as _Kunasekaran_ and _Goh Eng Chin._

26     Considering the absent of any significant offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors and bearing in mind the offence- specific aggravating factors, particularly, the Accused’s quick swipe over the Victim’s groin area twice over the clothes, an area proximate to the private parts of the Victim and the fact that the offence took place at the workplace where the Accused was the Victim’s superior, I was of the view that a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment was appropriate and commensurate with the culpability of the Accused_._

27     The Accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
