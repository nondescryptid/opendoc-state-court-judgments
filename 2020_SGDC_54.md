### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in a conspiracy to commit extortion, an offence under s 385 read with s 109 of the Penal Code , Cap 224 (“PC”)(DAC 929826/18), and one count of retaining possession of a Philippines passport belonging to one Jaoud Windelyn, an offence under s 47(5) of the Passports Act, Cap 220 (“PS”)(DAC 903983/19).

2       He had committed the offences when he was under a remission order made against him under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act, Cap 247. As such he had breached the remission order, and was liable to an enhanced sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 231 days for the two offences.

3       One count of personation as a police officer under s 170 of the Penal Code, and one count of dishonestly misappropriating an identity card under s 403 of the Penal Code, were taken into consideration. The identity card had belonged to Certis Cisco Pte Ltd.

4       The prosecution was done by DPP Thiagesh. Mr Pramnath Vijayakumar and Ng Shi Yang was assigned by CLAS to represent the Accused.

## THE FACTS

5       Sometime in July 2018, the Accused became acquainted with one “Catherine” via a website. “Catherine” was advertising escort services and the Accused had contacted her to get girls for sexual services. Later that same month, the Accused went to the Philippines where he met with “Catherine” and one “Mike”. He informed them that he was police officer. They maintained regular communication after this.

6       On 22 Aug 18, “Catherine’ informed the Accused that her agency was having some problems with one Jaoud Windelyn, a female Filipino national (“the victim”). The victim was a sex worker. “Catherine” asked the Accused to help her take the victim’s passport, and thereafter to extort the victim for money in order to get it back. The Accused agreed. Subsequently, “Mike” and Accused met at the IBIS Hotel at MacPherson, where “Mike” handed S$130 to the Accused.

7       The Accused used the S$130 to pay for a room at the hotel. He told the staff that he was a police officer conducting an undercover operation for vice activity. He told the hotel staff that he required the staff’s assistance to send a Filipino girl to his room.

8       The victim arrived at the hotel at about 8.000 pm. She asked for a “Jerome Tan” and the staff led her to the Accused’s room. In the room, the Accused spoke to the victim for about ten minutes before he flashed the CERTIS Cisco identity card and identified himself as a police officer. He then demanded $1,500 from her, threatening to arrest her if she did not pay.

9       The Accused then took her passport, her iPhone X and cash $40. He left the scene after that. Subsequently, he handed the passport to “Mike”. He gave the iPhone X to his fiancée.

## ACCUSED’S ANTECEDENTS

10     The Accused has two sets of antecedents for cheating (s 420 PC) and personating a public servant (s 170 PC) in 2014 and 2017.

11     In 2014, he was convicted on two counts under s 420 PC and one count under s 170 PC. Two counts under s 420 PC and one count under s 170 PC were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment each for the s 420 charges and three months’ imprisonment for the s 170 PC charge. The total aggregate sentence was nine months’ imprisonment/

12     In 2017, he was sentenced to three counts under s 419 PC (cheating by personation). Two counts under s 419 PC, two counts under s 420 and one count under s 380 PC (theft in dwelling) were taken into consideration. He was sentenced to 15 months’ for one count under s 419 PC, and six months’ for the remaining two counts of s 419 PC. The total aggregate sentence was 27 months’ imprisonment.

## THE SENTENCE

13     DPP Thiagesh asked for eight months’ imprisonment for the s 47(5) PA charge. He tendered sentencing precedents that showed that sentences ranging from four to nine months’ imprisonment had been imposed. DPP Thiagesh highlighted the aggravating factor that the offence was committed on the instructions of and for the benefit of a prostitution syndicate.

14     s 385 PC provided for a minimum mandatory sentence of two years’ imprisonment and mandatory caning. DPP Thiagesh sought an uplift of three months’ imprisonment because the Accused had personated as a police officer when he committed the offence, and the subject-matter of the extortion was the victim’s passport. He had also done this at the behest of a prostitution syndicate. As for caning, DPP Thiagesh only asked for one stroke.

15     On the s 50T Prisons Act offences, DPP Thiagesh asked for six weeks’ enhanced imprisonment for each charge. He also asked that the sentences for the s 385 PC and s 47(5) PA offences run consecutively as they related to distinct protected legal interests.

16     Mr Pramnath had no issue with the DPP’s submission relating to the s 50T Prisons Act offences. On the s 385 PC charge, he asked for the minimum mandatory imprisonment and one stroke of the cane. He cited various cases where the facts were similar or more egregious than the present case and the minimum mandatory imprisonments were meted out. As for the s 47(5) PA charge, he pointed out that it would be double-counting if the fact that this was a syndicated operation was taken into account in both charges. He also highlighted s 47(5) precedents where the facts were more egregious, and the sentences imposed were four months’ imprisonment. He therefore sought for a similar sentence.

17     I agreed with the submissions of the DPP that on the basis of the aggravating factors present in this case, an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence was warranted. The Accused had personated as a police officer and extorted the passport from her. He had done so at the behest of a prostitution syndicate. The objective of the whole scheme was to intimidate the victim, who was a sex worker, into conforming to the instructions of the syndicate. Therefore, it did not amount to double-counting to factor in the fact that this was a syndicated operation to the two offences. The whole scheme had involved elaborate planning. The Accused also has antecedents of cheating by personation in 2017. These were especially egregious factors that were absent in the cases cited by the defence.

18     However, I was of the opinion that mandatory minimum two years’ imprisonment for the s 385 PC offence was appropriate under the circumstances, and an uplift was not warranted. I also agreed that one stroke of the cane was appropriate. As for the s 47(5) PA offence, eight months’ imprisonment was appropriate and warranted to reflect the more egregious nature of the offence. These two charges involved separate protected legal interests. I therefore ordered the two sentences to run consecutively. For the s 50T Prisons Act offence, the Accused was liable for an enhanced punishment of not more than 231 days imprisonment. I noted that the Accused committed these offences about one month after his release from prison under the remission order. I therefore agreed that six weeks’ (ie 42 days) imprisonment for each charge was appropriate. Under s 50T(5), the six weeks enhanced imprisonment sentences were mandated by law to run consecutively to the imprisonment sentences imposed for the s 385 PC and s 47(5) PA offences.

19     The total aggregate sentence was therefore two years’ and eight months’ imprisonment and one stroke of the cane, and an enhanced sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment. The imprisonment sentence was backdated to 5 Sep 18.

20     On 21 Nov 19, I was informed that the Accused was unfit for caning. Having heard parties’ respective submissions, I remitted the sentence of caning fully.

21     The Accused has lodged an appeal against sentence.
