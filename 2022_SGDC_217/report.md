## Summary of Facts

### DAC-909148-2019

4       On 26 September 2018 at about 7.53 p.m., while the accused was with his girlfriend, Nur Firdhawaty Binte Johari (“Firdhawaty”), at the void deck of Block 249 Hougang Avenue 3, Singapore 530249, he was arrested by a party of Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers. During the arrest, a packet containing crystalline substance (marked as “JZA-A1”), which was concealed in a cigarette box, was seized from the table where the accused and Firdhawaty were at. The accused admitted that JZA-A1 belonged to him.

5       Investigations revealed that on 26 September 2018, the accused was informed by Firdhawaty that one Muhammad Fariz bin Aman (“Fariz”) needed 5 grammes of ‘Ice’. ‘Ice’ is the street name for methamphetamine. Firdhawaty had contacted the accused as he was her supplier. The agreed price was for $200. At about 6.30 p.m. on the same day, the accused called Firdhawaty and told her to meet him at the void deck of Block 249 Hougang Avenue 3. The accused brought with him exhibit “JZA-A1” as he intended it to be sold to Fariz.

6       The exhibit “JZA-A1” was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (‘HSA’) for analysis and was found to be one packet containing not less than 5.11 grams of crystalline substances which contained not less than 3.44 grams of methamphetamine.

### DAC-909150-2019

7       On 26 September 2018 at about 11.50 p.m., two packets of crystalline substances (later marked “JZA-C1A” and “JZA-C1B”) and one packet containing two tablets (later marked as “JZA-E1”) were seized from the back box of a motorcycle which the accused had ridden to the void deck of Block 249 Hougang Avenue 3 by the CNB officers.

8       The motorcycle had a false registration number FBE1052J. The accused had refused to inform the CNB officers where he parked the motorcycle as he was aware that it contained drugs and drugs utensils.

9       The exhibits “JZA-C1A”, “JZA-C1B” and “JZA-E1” were sent to the HSA for analysis. The three exhibits were found to contain not less than 4.79 grammes of methamphetamine.

### DAC-909153-2019

10     On 27 September 2018, at about 1 a.m., four packets containing vegetable matter (later marked as “JZA-F1B”, “JZA-F1C”, “JZA-F1D” and “JZA-F1E”) were seized from the accused’s house. The exhibits “JZA-F1B”, “JZA-F1C”, “JZA-F1D” and “JZA-F1E” were sent to the HSA for analysis. The four packets were found to contain not less than 6.09 grams of cannabis mixture.

### DAC-909154-2019

11     During CNB’s search of the accused’s house, CNB officers also recovered two improvised glassware used by the accused for the consumption of methamphetamine.

### DAC-909157-2019

12     On 30 April 2018, the accused was placed under drug supervision for 24 months with effect from 30 April 2018 to 29 April 2020. The accused failed to report for his urine test on 24 September 2018 (Monday) and 12 other occasions.

### DAC-915886-2019 & MAC-906071-2019

13     The complainant is the owner of a Yamaha motorcycle model RXZ 125 bearing registration number FY3447Y, which was valued at $8,500. He had authorised his employee to use the motorcycle. On 10 August 2018, the complainant lodged a police report stating that his motorcycle was missing.

14     On 8 August 2018 at about 4 p.m., the employee parked the motorcycle at the open car park between Block 271 and Block 272 Yishun Street 22, at Lot No.12. He did not handlebar-lock the motorcycle as the lock was spoilt. The key to the motorcycle’s engine was kept with him. At about 6 p.m. on 10 August 2018, he discovered the motorcycle to be missing.

15     Investigations revealed that sometime between 4 p.m. on 8 August 2018 and 6 a.m. on 10 August 2018, the accused went to the carpark where the motorcycle was parked. He was holding his helmet and looking around for a motorcycle to steal. He noticed the complainant’s motorcycle. He used a locker key to start the motorcycle’s engine and rode the motorcycle away.

16     Thereafter, the accused changed the number plate to FBE1052J and used the motorcycle for his transport. He was not in possession of any valid class 2B driving licence.

17     The motorcycle was recovered as a result of the accused’s arrest on 26 September 2018 by CNB.

### DAC-915909-2019 & MAC-906074-2019

18     The victim is one Muhammad Irfandy Bin Riduan, the owner of a Yamaha motorcycle model RXZ bearing registration number FU3741T valued at about $4,000 plus. The accused’s accomplice is one Muhammad Hafiz Bin Yahya (“Hafiz”). On 18 September 2018, the victim lodged a police report to inform that his motorcycle was missing.

19     On 18 September 2018 at around 3am, the victim parked his motorcycle at the open car park of Block 319 Ang Mo Kio Street 31 at Lot no.101. At about 1.15 p.m. on the same day, he discovered his motorcycle to be missing.

20     Investigations established that between 3 a.m. and 1.15 p.m. on 18 September 2018, the accused noticed the victim’s motorcycle’s light was left on. The victim had removed the motorcycle’s key but he did not switch off the engine. The accused decided to steal the victim’s motorcycle in order to use it as another transport vehicle. He started the motorcycle’s engine with a key he had and rode the motorcycle away. He was not in possession of any valid class 2B driving licence.

21     He left the victim’s motorcycle at an unknown location, and thereafter rode motorcycle FY3447Y to pick up Hafiz. He had instructed Hafiz to bring a number plate for the victim’s motorcycle. After picking up Hafiz, he rode to the location where he had left the victim’s motorcycle. He told Hafiz to ride the victim’s motorcycle while he followed behind on FY3447Y. They proceeded to the carpark at Block 217 Ang Mo Kio where Hafiz changed the number plate of the victim’s motorcycle on the accused’s instructions and the accused removed the IU unit. He also threw away the original number plate of the victim’s motorcycle. After the Accused acquired the victim’s motorcycle, he allowed Hafiz to use motorcycle FY3447Y.

22     On 20 September 2018, the victim’s motorcycle was recovered when his girlfriend and friend spotted the motorcycle at Lot 32 of the carpark at Block 216 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. The false number plate caused the victim’s girlfriend to initially believe that the motorcycle was not the victim’s missing motorcycle, but his friend noticed that stickers of the victim’s motorcycle had been removed and thrown beside the motorcycle.

### DAC-916666-2019

23     Following the accused’s arrest on 26 September 2018, at about 3.20 a.m. on 27 September 2018, at the CNB Headquarters, the accused failed to provide without any reasonable excuse a specimen of his urine sample for urine tests. He was warned that he may be prosecuted for failing to provide a urine specimen. Between 3.20 a.m. to 9.20 a.m. on 27 September 2018, he was offered water to drink on 14 occasions about every half an hour. He drank some of the water provided, but claimed he was unable to provide his urine specimen. At about 6.18 a.m. on 27 September 2018, the accused was examined by a doctor. He was certified to be well and fit to provide urine.

## Mitigation

25     For the trafficking charge, the defence urged me to impose a sentence of 10 years and two months imprisonment and with the mandatory 10 strokes of the cane. It was submitted that the quantity of drugs is low and the accused committed the offence at the request of a person he was ‘romantically entangled’ with.

26     For the possession charge involving cannabis mixture, the defence submitted for the minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment. For the possession of methamphetamine, the defence submitted for a one month uplift above the minimum term taking into account the TIC charges. For failing to provide the urine specimen, the minimum sentence was sought.

27     For the possession of utensils charge, the defence submitted for a sentence of three months’ imprisonment. For the failure to report for urine test, a sentence of four months imprisonment was suggested.

28     For the two theft of motorcycle charges, the defence submitted for a sentence of 10 months and eight months imprisonment respectively and four years disqualification from driving, and a $600 fine on each of the two charges of driving without a licence.

29     In total, the defence urged me to impose 10 years 9 months imprisonment with 13 strokes, fine of $1,200 and four years disqualification from driving.

## Sentence

30     Out of the 10 charges proceeded with, three sentences were ordered to run consecutively. I will therefore only deal with the calibration of the individual sentences of the three charges which make up the total sentence.

### The trafficking charge

31     Section 33(4A)(i) MDA prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and 10 strokes and a maximum of 30 years imprisonment and 15 strokes for a repeat conviction under s 5(1) in relation to a Class A drug.

32     It was common ground that the accused was not deserving of the minimum imprisonment term. The issue was the extent of the uplift. The prosecution submitted for an uplift of 2 years and two months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane. On the other hand, the defence submitted for a two month uplift.

33     I did not accept both submissions. The uplift that I decided upon was nine months. The quantity of methamphetamine in the proceeded charge is low - 3.44g. If this charge had stood alone and if the accused had the mitigation of an early plea of guilt, I would have imposed the minimum sentence. However, both these factors were not present. The proceeded charge related to drugs to be sold to Fariz. The fact that it was done at the request of Firdhawaty with whom the accused was ‘romantically entangled’ does not lessen his culpability. In calibrating the uplift, I took note of the following. There were three other distinct charges which were TICed which added to the quantity of drugs involved and shows that it was not an isolated act of trafficking done at the request of Firdhawaty. She had approached the accused because he was also her supplier. In this regard, one TIC charge related to selling 4.24g of ice to her. Another two TIC charges related to selling ice to one Samantha; 1.52g on the first occasion and eight tablets which contained _inter alia_ 0.63g of MDMA on a second occasion. The accused’s drug activity was therefore not limited to ice. Lastly, the offence was committed whilst the accused was under drug supervision.

34     I noted in favour of the accused that he eventually pleaded guilty. However, the weight to be given was limited. He did so more than three years after he was charged and also after Firdhawaty had completed her evidence-in-chief.

35     Accordingly, I assessed an uplift of nine months’ imprisonment to be appropriate. There was no uplift to the sentence of caning.

### The possession charge

36     As the accused had a prior conviction of drug possession in 2010, the mandatory minimum sentence was two years imprisonment and the maximum was ten years imprisonment.

37     This charge related to the possession of 4.79g of ice which was found in the back box of the motorcycle. There was one other TIC charge relating to 1.33g of ketamine which was also found in the back box. The accused did not cooperate in the recovery of the drugs. After his arrest, he had refused to inform the CNB officers where he parked the motorcycle. In addition, there were also other drugs found at his residence which related to another drug type of cannabis mixture. The accused had been released from DRC in April 2018 and committed this offence within six months of his release and whilst he was subject to a urine supervision order.

38     Accordingly, the culpability of the accused was high. The only mitigating factor was the plea of guilty but the weight was limited as the drugs were found in the box of his motorcycle and at his residence. I agreed with the prosecution that an uplift of four months above the minimum sentence is warranted.

### The theft of motorcycle charges

39     The offence carries mandatory imprisonment up to seven years and mandatory disqualification from driving upon release.

40     The first theft was premeditated. On the undisputed facts for the first theft charge, the accused had a motorcycle helmet with him and he was looking around in the carpark to steal a motorcycle. After the theft, he replaced the registration plates to avoid detection. He clearly had no intent to return the motorcycle. The value of the motorcycle was $8,500. The motorcycle was recovered more than six weeks later only as a result of the arrest of the accused.

41     The second theft charge was committed in the following month. The value of the motorcycle was $4,000. The accused decided to steal the motorcycle when he noticed an opportunity as the motorcycle light was left on. He got the accomplice involved by asking him to meet him with a set of registration plates. The accused again had no intention to return the motorcycle as he replaced its registration plates. The motorcycle was recovered fortuitously two days later.

42     The accused has property antecedents, with multiple offending under s 379A. In 2010, he received 24 months’ imprisonment on one charge under s 379A and five years DQ. Unfortunately, this did not deter him. He went on to commit the present two offences despite having no driving licence. Accordingly, specific deterrence called for an escalation of the imprisonment term (see _Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 769</span>). The only mitigating factor was the plea of guilt. In my view, the prosecution’s submission for a sentence of two years and six months imprisonment with five years DQ on each of two charges was appropriate, and the accused was sentenced accordingly.

### Total sentence

43     There is a clear cycle of drug and property related offending. I ordered three sentences to run consecutively which related to separate offending and involved the invasion of separate legal interests. I had borne in mind the totality principle which is to ensure proportionality of the aggregate sentence and to avoid a ‘crushing’ sentence in selecting the three terms to run consecutively. Apart from the enhanced trafficking charge, the drug possession and theft charge best encapsulated the accused’s overall culpability. In my view, the total sentence of 14 years and 19 months imprisonment and 13 strokes with the five years disqualification from driving was commensurate with the extent of the offending and did not require any recalibration of the individual sentences.
