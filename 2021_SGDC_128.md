\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9817/2020/01.\]

12 July 2021

### District Judge Ong Chin Rhu:

1       The Accused, Ms Nithiya d/o Harithas, claimed trial to 14 charges[^1] comprising:

> (a)     seven charges under section 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Revised Edition) for forging seven cheques belonging to her employers, Fuur Associates Pte Ltd (“Fuur”), by inserting her name as payee after they had been executed; and

> (b)     seven charges under section 477A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Revised Edition) for falsifying seven payment vouchers or invoices in the possession of Fuur.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty and convicted her on all the proceeded charges. I sentenced the Accused to a global term of 13 months’ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with her _conviction and sentence_ has filed an appeal. She is currently _on bail_ pending the hearing of her appeal.

3       I had provided brief oral grounds at the conclusion of the trial to explain some of my findings and my decision to convict the Accused.[^2] I shall elaborate on my reasons for conviction and sentence in these grounds.

## The Charges

4       The seven proceeded charges under section 467 of the Penal Code (“the forgery charges”) were similarly framed, save for the details relating to the date of the offence, as well as the serial number of the OCBC Bank cheque involved. As such, I shall set out in full the first of such charges followed by a table containing the salient details of each of the seven charges for reference:

>     DAC-924287-2017

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, sometime on or before 2nd January 2014, at the office of Fuur Associates Pte Ltd, located in No. 395 Jalan Besar #02-01, Singapore, did forge a certain document which purports to be a valuable security, to wit, an OCBC Bank Cheque bearing serial number 681109, by dishonestly altering the said cheque without lawful authority after it has been executed, _to wit_, by inserting your name as payee, with intent to commit fraud, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 467 of the Penal Code, (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).

5       As for the seven proceeded charges under section 477A of the Penal Code (“the falsification charges”), they were also similarly crafted, save as to the date of the offence and the details of the document falsified. Therefore, I set out the first of such charges in full, followed by a table containing the relevant elements of each of the seven charges for reference:

>     DAC-924321-2017

>     You \[…\] are charged that you, sometime on or before 2nd January 2014, at the office of Fuur Associates Pte Ltd (“the Company”), located in No. 395 Jalan Besar #02-01, Singapore, being employed as a servant, _to wit_, an administrative staff of the Company, did wilfully and with intent to defraud, falsify a payment voucher in the possession of the Company dated 2 January 2014 with voucher number P140105, _to wit_, you made an entry with the description “Project Fees” in the said payment voucher, bearing an amount of SGD$2500/-, which you knew were false, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 477A of the Penal Code, (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).

8       At the conclusion of the trial, parties further agreed to the following facts as set out in the Further Statement of Agreed Facts (Exhibit PS2):

![]([2021] SGDC 0128_Image/[2021] SGDC 0128_image3.png)

![]([2021] SGDC 0128_Image/[2021] SGDC 0128_image4.png)

![]([2021] SGDC 0128_Image/[2021] SGDC 0128_image5.png)

9       During the course of the trial, it was not disputed that Fuur was a design firm engaged in various projects from hospitality to restaurants. At the material time, Fuur was a small firm comprising two directors, Zhou Ciming (PW1, “Dean”) and Jasper Chia Chee Xiang (“Jasper”), as well as five to six employees. The main job scope of the directors was to handle and design projects, including liaising with clients and disseminating the brief and information to the design staff to execute the drawings. The directors were both authorised signatories of Fuur’s OCBC bank cheques. It was not disputed that Dean had signed the seven cheques in P1 to P7.

10     In addition, it was not disputed that as an administrative staff, one of the Accused’s duties at Fuur was to prepare cheques and supporting documents for payments by Fuur to its employees and third parties. She was also the only person in Fuur who was tasked to file the records of payments, including salary vouchers, payment vouchers and invoices, in Fuur’s payment voucher files. Fuur’s files were placed in the locked cabinets located behind the Accused’s desk. At the material time, only Dean, Jasper and the Accused had the keys to the cabinets. The Accused also managed Fuur’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) submissions for its employees and would print out and file the CPF contribution records.

11     It was not disputed that at the end of each month, the Accused prepared the salary vouchers and cheques for the directors’ signature. Each salary cheque would be accompanied by two copies of the employee’s salary voucher (clipped behind the cheque). The cheque and both copies of the employee’s salary voucher would be signed by a director to approve the payment. If the director signed the cheque but omitted to sign the salary vouchers, the Accused would apply the Fuur stamp at the approval field in the vouchers. The Accused would then arrange to pass the cheque to the recipient and have the recipient sign both copies of the salary voucher to acknowledge receipt. Thereafter, one copy each of the salary voucher would be kept by Fuur and the recipient respectively. Fuur’s copy of the salary voucher would be filed in the payment voucher file.

12     Sometime around mid-July 2014, a company named Summer Productions Private Limited (“Summer Productions”) invested in Fuur. Ms Jessica Chan Sim Yuk (PW2, “Jessica”) was the finance and human resource manager of Summer Productions. In the same year, Jessica introduced an accounting software called “MYOB” to Fuur and taught the Accused how to use the system. The Accused was in charge of entering the details of each payment into the MYOB system.

13     Based on PS1 and PS2, it was agreed that during the period from January 2014 to September 2016, the Accused prepared a total of 34 cheques (including P1 to P7) for sums ranging from $2400 to $3,400. The Accused was stated as the payee in these cheques and she had encashed and received the sums payable in all the cheques. It was also not disputed that none of these payments were reflected in the Accused’s salary vouchers at the material time.

14     Further it was largely undisputed that the Accused’s net monthly salary from July 2014 to June 2016, as stated in Fuur’s salary vouchers prepared by her, was $1840 (with a basic pay of $1150 before CPF deductions, plus a “bonus” or “reimbursement” of $920 per month).[^3] However, from July 2016 onwards, her net pay was stated in her salary vouchers as $1200 (with a basic pay of $1500 before CPF deductions and no added bonus or reimbursement).[^4]

15     It was also undisputed that Fuur initiated proceedings against the Accused in District Court Suit No. 214 of 2017 (“the civil suit”) in relation to various cheque payments she received during the course of her employment with Fuur.

16     Finally, it was not disputed that during the course of investigations, the Accused had denied committing any criminal offence and gave the cautioned statements in Exhibits D7 and D8 voluntarily to the investigating officer, Assistant Superintendent of Police Chan Yue Cheong (PW8), who was then holding the rank of Inspector.

17     The prosecution’s case was that the Accused was not rightfully entitled to the payments in the cheques in P1 to P7. The prosecution’s contention, in a nutshell, was that the Accused had left the payee field of the cheques blank when they were presented to Dean for signature and that Dean did not know that these cheques were to be made payable to the Accused. The Accused had forged the cheques by inserting her name as payee after Dean had signed them. In addition, the prosecution alleged that the Accused had falsified the seven corresponding payment vouchers or invoices set out in the falsification charges to mask the unauthorised payments and cover her tracks .

18     The defence’s case, in essence, was that the Accused was fully entitled to the payments in P1 to P7 as these were prepared by her based on the instructions of the directors of Fuur. P1 and P2 were payments to her as “administrative portion fee” for a project in Bali while P3 to P7 represented salary increments accorded to her due to her increased job scope. Further, the Accused’s name was already stated in the cheques when Dean signed them. With regard to the falsification charges, while the Accused agreed that the payment vouchers and invoices mentioned therein were spurious, she denied having anything to do with them. The defence’s case was that these were probably fabricated by persons associated with Fuur to frame the Accused.

## The case for the prosecution

19     The prosecution called eight witnesses to prove their case against the Accused. Dean and Jessica were the key witnesses and their evidence is summarised below.

### PW1 - Zhou Ciming (“Dean”)

#### The Accused’s employment with Fuur

20     Dean testified that he first came to know the Accused in early to mid-2012 when she was employed by a restaurant called Suprette, which was located near Fuur. One of the partners of Suprette, Mr Varian Lim, rented a desk in Fuur’s office to do his paperwork and Dean noticed the Accused coming to assist him. During that period, Fuur was taking on numerous projects, and, as Dean and Jasper were not trained in administrative matters, they decided to engage the Accused for such tasks on a part-time basis. Pursuant to this arrangement, Fuur and Suprette would each pay half of the Accused’s salary.[^5]

21     Subsequently, in late 2012, Fuur employed the Accused as a full-time administrative assistant. Her main job scope was to assist the directors in bookkeeping, purchasing toiletries and food to stock the pantry, liaising with the cleaner, and preparing staff salary vouchers at the end of each month.[^6]

22     Dean testified that starting from May 2014, Jessica came to Fuur’s office every Friday for a few hours. She implemented the MYOB system and taught the Accused how to properly document and keep track of Fuur’s expenses and earnings.[^7]

23     During cross-examination, Dean agreed that he would be out of the office either for the whole day or part of the day on two or three days each week.[^8] Dean also agreed that since he became actively involved as a director of Fuur in 2014, he had taken a keen and active interest in the finances and cash flow of the company.[^9]

24     To facilitate regular daily communications, Dean, Jasper and the Accused were in a WhatsApp group chat called “FA + admin”. From time to time, especially towards the end of the month, the Accused would update the directors concerning the balance in Fuur’s bank account.[^10]

#### Payments to directors and staff in Fuur

25     Dean testified that at the end of each month, the Accused would prepare the salary cheques and corresponding salary vouchers for each of Fuur’s employees and present the documents to either him or Jasper for signature. Fuur’s chequebooks were kept in a secured cabinet located behind the Accused’s table and only Dean, Jasper and the Accused had access to the cabinet.[^11]

26     The designers at Fuur were paid a fixed salary at the end of each month. At the material time, their monthly salary ranged from $2,400 to $3,300 and they did not receive any commissions for the projects they were involved in.[^12] During cross-examination, Dean added that Fuur paid commissions only to the directors. Such payments would be captured in the director’s salary vouchers as bonus under the “additions” section.[^13] These monthly lump sum payments were not subject to CPF contributions and were regarded as director’s fees. They were paid to the directors over and above their basic pay (which was subject to CPF contributions).[^14] Dean also emphasised that the directors were usually the last to receive their pay as they needed to ensure that all the staff salaries and overheads were paid first. He pointed out that clients often did not pay on time and Fuur would need the money for cash flow.[^15]

27     The Accused was paid a fixed salary of about $1,800 at the end of each month, and her pay was reflected in the salary vouchers prepared by her (Exhibits P8-1 to P8-34). Dean explained that P8-1 to P8-6 were salary vouchers issued by Suprette while P8-7 to P8-34 were Fuur salary vouchers. Dean further explained that either he or Jasper would sign at the “Approved by” column of the salary voucher while the “Received by” column would be endorsed by the staff who received the pay.[^16]

28     During cross-examination, when referred to the salary voucher in P8-7, Dean agreed that only the “basic pay” component of the Accused’s salary was subject to CPF contributions while the “bonus” component was not. While Dean could not remember the exact details that led to this computation, he agreed that this was an agreement reached with the Accused and it resulted in both Fuur and the Accused contributing a smaller amount for CPF.[^17]

29     Subsequently, when Dean was referred to a joint affidavit dated 4 October 2017 affirmed by him and Jasper (Exhibit D2) where various “project commissions” were stated to have been paid out in May 2014 to both of them, he explained that there was a policy in the office at that time to pay the director who brought in a particular project a bonus. While Dean agreed that such payments were not reflected in the salary vouchers of the directors, he emphasised that only the directors who clinched a project were entitled to such payments. Dean also added that he did not recall such payments earlier during his testimony as they were made several years ago, and Fuur’s payment structure had since evolved (with the change in management).[^18]

#### Signing of the disputed cheques

30     Dean testified that at the end of each month, the Accused would present around eight to nine cheques to him, together with the corresponding salary vouchers, for his signature.[^19]

31     According to Dean, when the cheque in P1 was presented to him, the numerical value of the cheque was stated but the “pay” field was left blank. Dean recalled that when the Accused presented cheques without a named payee to him, she would inform him that she had forgotten to fill in the “pay” field. In addition, she would either tell him that the cheque was for salary or for monthly rental of the shophouse occupied by Fuur. With regard to P1, Dean testified that the Accused did not inform him that it was for payment to her. Although Dean could not recall exactly what the Accused told him the cheque was for, Dean believed that she probably said it was for one of the designers. Further, she would probably have presented the cheque with the salary voucher of a design staff such as a junior designer or draftsman.[^20]

32     Dean added that on a number of occasions when the Accused told him that she had forgotten to write the payee’s name in the cheque, he had asked the Accused why the payee was missing and reminded her to fill in the payee’s name. Dean further explained that he was usually busy handling design projects when the Accused presented the cheques and salary vouchers to him. As such, he did not have time to go through each and every document. Instead, he would glance through the salary vouchers which were supposed to tally with the corresponding cheques. Besides salary payments, the bundle of documents presented to Dean by the Accused would also include payments for monthly rent and other miscellaneous items such as instalment payments for the printer. According to Dean, it was not his nature to carefully sit down and go through everything. This was especially so since he trusted the Accused. In addition, the numerical values in the cheques made sense to him and he “sort of” knew which ones were for who. Hence, he would proceed to sign the cheques as he went through the documents. Dean clarified that this was the same even when he saw a blank payee field in a cheque, except that he would ask the Accused why the name was not filled in. Dean emphasised that this was because he trusted the Accused.[^21]

33     The cheque in P2 was similarly presented to Dean by the Accused in a bundle together with other cheques and documents. Due to the passage of time, Dean could not recall how many cheques there were in the bundle or what the Accused told him was the purpose of the cheque. Dean testified that when he signed the cheque, the payee field was blank. The Accused had either told him she had forgotten to state the payee or that she knew this cheque was for a particular purpose, such as the monthly office rent (which was about $3,000 to $3,500 during that period) or the salary of one of the design staff. Dean would have proceeded to remind her to insert the payee. He had briefly glanced through the accompanying documents before proceeding to sign. Dean confirmed in Court that the Accused did tell not him that the payment in P2 was for her.[^22]

34     Dean further testified that he had signed the cheques in P3 to P7 under similar circumstances. Dean did not authorise the Accused to insert her name as payee in any of the cheques in P1 to P7, and when he signed them, he thought they were for legitimate payments such as rent or salary of the design staff. Dean clarified that the payment of rent would be supported by a simple payment voucher in a format different from a salary voucher. In addition, he would always be presented with a stack of cheques to sign, which he would do at “one go” and never a single cheque by itself. Dean reiterated that he had signed the cheques in P1 to P7 even though the payee was not stated because he trusted the Accused.[^23] During re-examination, Dean affirmed that he would not have signed P1 to P7 had the Accused’s name been stated as payee because numerically, the amount would not match her salary.[^24]

35     As P1 and P2 were dated 2 January 2014 and P3 was dated 24 January 2014, Dean was asked during cross-examination whether he could remember if the cheques were presented to him on either one or two occasions in January 2014, and whether they were presented to him with other cheques or by themselves. Dean responded that he could not recall but added that generally, the batches of cheques would be presented to him for signature either during the third or the last week of each month.[^25]

36     Dean also testified that as at January 2014, Fuur had eight employees including him and Jasper. As such, P3 was likely to have been presented to him for signature with approximately seven other cheques. Dean was unable to recall how many of the .cheques presented to him then had no payee stated.[^26] However, while Dean initially testified that P3 would have been clipped together with two copies of another employee’s salary voucher and not the Accused’s, he was unable to match the amount stated in P3 with those in Fuur’s salary list for January 2014 (Exhibit P17-1).[^27] Dean explained that when he signed the cheques, he did so rather quickly and did not remember specifically the actual amount of each staff’s salary. In reality, Dean only had a “vague general idea”. As the figures made sense and as he trusted the Accused, he did not go through figures in detail. In relation to P3, Dean also clarified that he actually could not recall whether the cheque was accompanied by a salary voucher, a document relating to rent, or a photographer’s invoice.[^28]

37     During cross-examination, Dean added that aside from P1 to P7, he was not sure if the Accused had given him other cheques to sign without the name of the payee stated.[^29] Dean agreed, however, that Fuur instructed counsel to initiate civil proceedings against the Accused in relation to alleged fraudulent payments made to her by way of various cheques, in addition to those in P1 to P7.[^30]

#### The Accused’s resignation

38     Dean testified that sometime in June or July 2016, the Accused tendered her resignation and informed him and Jasper that she was seeking other opportunities. As the Accused was working with Jessica to ensure a smooth transition of Fuur’s books and accounts into the accounting resources deployed by Summer Productions, Dean and Jasper requested the Accused to stay on with Fuur to help with the transition. During cross-examination, Dean could not recall whether the Accused was working on a part-time basis with Fuur from July 2016 onwards. There was also no significant reduction of her responsibilities. The Accused eventually left Fuur’s employment sometime in October 2016. According to Dean, the Accused’s performance started to deteriorate towards the tail end of her employment with Fuur. She took a lot of sick leave, beyond the usual quota allowed and made errors at work. As such, Dean and Jasper reached a mutual agreement with the Accused for her to leave at the end of the transition period.[^31]

39     During cross-examination, Dean testified that he had deleted the WhatsApp group chat after the Accused left Fuur in October 2016. In addition, sometime around December 2016, Dean’s phone was damaged and he bought a new phone. Dean assumed that Jasper would also have deleted the group chat after the Accused left Fuur.[^32] When shown the joint affidavit verifying supplementary list of documents dated 18 July 2019 affirmed by him and Jasper (Exhibit D3), which stated that the Whatspp group chat was deleted sometime in end July 2016 immediately after the Accused resigned, Dean testified that he was not sure when Jasper had deleted the group chat. As for himself, though he could not be entirely sure when he deleted it, he recollected that they kept the group chat during the period the Accused was handing over her duties. As such, he would have deleted the chat sometime in late October to early November 2016.[^33]

#### Discovery of the falsified documents

40     Sometime in September or October 2016, Charles Loh (“Charles”), one of the directors in Summer Productions, alerted Dean and Jasper about certain discrepancies and anomalies in Fuur’s accounts. Subsequently, Charles, Alvin Koh (the other director of Summer Productions), Jasper and Dean went through Fuur’s accounts together. When they dug deeper, they discovered payment vouchers which they had never seen before. These were found in Fuur’s files placed in the locked cabinets located behind the Accused’s table. Only Dean, Jasper and the Accused had the keys to the cabinets. Following the discovery, the directors decided to speak to the Accused. As such, they tasked Jessica to get in touch with the Accused and invite her back to the office for a discussion.[^34]

41     During cross-examination, Dean explained that before the Accused left, Jessica had already informed him that there were certain discrepancies in Fuur’s books that needed to be addressed before the Accused’s departure. However, as there were no suspicions of any wrongdoing on the part of the Accused at that time, nobody had questioned her about the accounts, suspicious payments or questionable documents.[^35]

#### Directors confronted the Accused

42     Subsequently, Alvin, Charles, Jasper and Dean met the Accused in the office sometime in late November 2016. They confronted her with the documents they unearthed during the internal investigations (including Exhibits P9 to P15) and asked her a series of questions. Dean could not recall if the documents shown to the Accused included the cheques in P1 to P7. However, as they took time to obtain copies of the cheques from the bank, he believed the cheques were not available when they met the Accused. Dean testified that the Accused denied having anything to do with the documents shown to her during the meeting and largely kept silent.[^36]

#### The police report

43     After the meeting, the directors decided to make a police report and Dean proceeded to do so on 1 December 2016 at the Commercial Affairs Department (see Exhibit P16). In P16, Dean mentioned the discovery of cheques which he did not sign, as well as cheques which were given by the Accused to him for signature with only the amount but not the name of the payee filled in. In Court, Dean explained that he had noticed certain anomalies in his signature in some cheques. At the same time, there were other cheques which he could confirm were signed by him, but when he signed these cheques, only the amounts were stated and the names of payees were left blank. The cheques in P1 to P7 belonged to the latter category.[^37]

44     During cross-examination, Dean agreed that in December 2016, his position was that the Accused had forged his signature in approximately 20 cheques.[^38] However, at the trial, Dean could not be sure whether the Accused had forged his signature in certain cheques which were not the subject matter of the proceeded charges.[^39]

#### Irregular features of the falsified documents

45     Dean also elaborated on why the documents in P9 to P15 appeared invalid to him. In relation to the payment voucher in P9, Dean testified that the payee’s name should be stated instead of “cash”. In addition, the description of payment as “project fees” was too ambiguous and vague whereas an official Fuur document would contain a more detailed reference to the project as well as specify the stage of the project the payment was for. Dean also pointed out that the signature in the “payment approved by” field was not his or Jasper’s but appeared to be a “casual” signature of the Accused. Finally, the “received by” column should be signed by the recipient instead of being stamped “by hand”.[^40]

46     Dean had similar comments for the payment voucher in P10 except that he recognised his “rushed” or “quick” signature at the “payment approved by” column. Dean believed that he signed this voucher thinking that it was for a specific legitimate payment and without noticing the irregular features of the voucher; otherwise, he would never have approved it.[^41] During cross-examination, Dean stated that he was not sure if the fields in P10 were filled up when he appended his signature but agreed that he would not have signed if he noticed the irregular features in the document. Further, he could have signed P10 when it was blank if he were led to believe that it was for a legitimate payment.[^42]

47     Turning to the payment voucher in P11, Dean again observed that it should not state “pay to cash”. As for the description of the payment as “Paulo resignation bonus”, Dean explained that Paulo was one of Fuur’s senior designers who worked with Fuur in the earlier years. Dean believed he would already have left Fuur by the date of the voucher. Furthermore, if a staff had indeed been paid a resignation bonus, it would have been stated in an official Fuur salary voucher and his bonus would not have been set out in a voucher in this format. In addition, the signature in the “payment approved by” field did not appear to be either his or Jasper’s but looked to him to be the Accused’s signature. Finally, there was no signature of the recipient in the “received by” column.[^43]

48     In relation to the payment voucher in P12, Dean observed that the description of the payment was “designer fee (internship)”. Dean explained that while Fuur did hire interns from “Laselle” or the universities under an official internship programme, the interns would be paid industrial rates of between $300 to $500 per month, for a period of three months. The interns would be paid alongside the staff, at the end of each month, with the payment documented in the Fuur salary voucher. Fuur had never paid any interns the amount of $2,400 as stated in P12 – which was akin to the starting pay of a junior designer in Fuur.[^44] Dean added that in a legitimate payment voucher, the “payment approved by” field would be signed by one of the directors instead of being stamped with a Fuur stamp as seen in P12.

49     When asked to review the invoice in P13, Dean took issue with the description of the payment which was stated as “provide professional assistance to the team for design works from Ms Danielle”. Dean testified that where an external vendor such as a photographer provided services to Fuur, the vendor would raise an official invoice. As such, Dean would have expected “Ms Danielle” to issue an invoice containing her payment details to Fuur so that Fuur could render payment to her. Dean added that Fuur did not have dealings with a “Ms Danielle” and did not outsource design works to a third party. In any event, if such a person did render works to Fuur, she would sign in the “authorised signature” column of her invoice. Instead, Fuur’s stamp was found in that column, indicating that Fuur had raised the invoice to itself.[^45]

50     As for P14, Dean pointed out that instead of being directed to the Accused, matters concerning payment for services rendered to Fuur should be addressed to either him or Jasper as directors of Fuur. Further, the description of the payment as “professional fee”, “YR 2014” and “designer fee” was too vague. When it was highlighted to Dean that it was stated at the bottom of the invoice that ‘all cheque payment should be made and crossed “Chia Shu Ying”’, Dean explained that Ms Chia Shu Ying (PW3, “Shu Ying”) was an employee of Fuur for about one-and-a-half years from 2012. During her employment, she would be issued a Fuur salary voucher with her pay cheque at the end of each month and would not be raising an invoice to Fuur for payment. Dean also pointed out that even if she had left Fuur by then and P14 was an invoice from her, it should bear her own letterhead (assuming she had one) as well as her signature, and state the payment details such as her bank account number or a postal address for payment by cheque.[^46]

51     Finally, in relation to P15, Dean again pointed out that the invoice, if it were for services rendered to Fuur, should not be directed to the Accused but to him or Jasper instead. As for the description of payment stated as “professional fee”, “YR 2015” and “professional fee (freelance)”, Dean stated that Fuur did not engage any freelancer to assist in any projects with AutoCAD works or 3D rendering. Even if they did, there would be a specific project description. In addition, P15 did not state who the billing party was.[^47]

52     During cross-examination, Dean agreed that it was Jessica who first discovered the spurious invoices and payment vouchers and showed them to him. At this point of the trial, the original copies of P9 to P15 were not available in Court, and Dean was asked specifically if he could recall whether the original copies of P9 to P15 shown to him were black-and-white or in colour. Dean testified that they were mostly in black and white but he could recall that the Fuur company stamp had a slightly purplish circular border. In addition, Dean recalled that the “paid” stamp in the documents would be red. Dean added that the documents shown to him were the originals but Fuur was unable to locate them.[^48] Subsequently, when the original copies of P9 to P15 were located and tendered to Court,[^49] Dean was asked why his earlier descriptions as to the colours in the documents differed from those seen in the originals. Dean explained that it was because he could not remember and was unsure of the colours in the documents.[^50]

53     During cross-examination, Dean initially testified that the Accused never presented him cheques together with the documents in P9 to P15. If she did, he would have questioned her about them as they were obviously invalid.[^51] However, when subsequently shown a joint affidavit dated 18 August 2017 (Exhibit D1) which he and Jasper had affirmed for the purpose of the civil proceedings, Dean testified that he could not be sure exactly what documents accompanied the cheques in P1 to P7 or whether they were genuine documents (such as salary vouchers, rental documents or a photographer’s invoice), or falsified ones such as those in P9 to P15. Dean explained that he could not be entirely sure as the events happened some time ago. However, he reiterated that he was sure that the cheques he signed were not meant for payment to the Accused.[^52]

### PW2 - Jessica Chan Sim Yuk

54     Jessica was tasked by Charles to take over the accounts at Fuur as the accounting work used to be done by an external accounting firm. In July 2014, Jessica set up the accounting software, MYOB, in Fuur and taught the Accused how to perform data entry as well as bank statement reconciliation in the system.

55     Jessica would go to Fuur’s office once or twice a month. As the Accused did not have accounting background, Jessica would check if she had any questions concerning the MYOB system. Jessica testified that she would not go through Fuur’s accounts in detail but would go into the MYOB system to have a look.[^53] She also did not review the MYOB records in detail. Instead, she would generate reports from the system pertaining to sales revenue, expenses and profits.[^54] During the period from January 2015 to June 2016, Jessica would generally spend less than an hour at Fuur’s office each time,[^55] and, apart from the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts, she did not look into other accounts in the MYOB system.[^56]

#### Discovery of “cash” payments in the accounts

56     Jessica testified that after the Accused tendered her resignation sometime in late June or July 2016, she continued to work part-time until October 2016.[^57] After the Accused’s departure, Jessica took charge of Fuur’s accounts. She brought all the files (including the payment voucher files, bank statement files and CPF contribution files) and the accounting software to Summer Production’s office and proceeded to check whether any payment voucher or billings were not entered into the system. This was done to prepare the audit reports for July 2014 to June 2015 for submission to the auditor.[^58] During cross-examination, Jessica testified that it was only from November 2016 that she would be in Fuur’s office every Friday. This was because she had taken over the Accused’s administrative work and needed to help Fuur issue payments and bills.[^59]

#### Retrieving the payment vouchers and invoices from Fuur’s files

57     Jessica noticed that there was an account called “professional fee” in the accounting software which listed monthly outgoing “cash” payments consisting of similar amounts. Jessica proceeded to search the payment voucher files she had retrieved from Fuur to look for the relevant payment vouchers or invoices. This was so that she could understand the purpose of these payments. During cross-examination, Jessica explained that for accounting purposes, payments to “cash” would invite queries from the auditor. Hence, even if she were to notice only one “cash” payment, she would still follow up to check.[^60] Jessica noticed that the vouchers and invoices relating to these cash payments did not state the names of the payees. As such, Jessica sent WhatsApp messages to the Accused to ask what the payments were for and who they were made to. The Accused’s response was that she could not remember.[^61]

58     Following this discovery, Jessica asked Charles if he knew about the cash payments. As Charles was unaware, he told Jessica he would check with Fuur’s directors. Subsequently, Charles informed Jessica that Dean and Jasper also did not know about those payments and instructed Jessica to retrieve all the invoices and payment vouchers relating to them. Jessica did as instructed and retrieved the invoices and payment vouchers for the period beginning January 2014 from Fuur’s payment voucher files. Jessica testified that by looking at the documents herself, she was unable to tell who those payments were made to.[^62]

59     Jessica updated Charles on her findings. Subsequently, Charles asked her to fix an appointment for the Accused to return to the office of Summer Productions to explain the payments to Jessica. The Accused told Jessica she was not free to attend as she was going on a business trip. Eventually, Jessica was asked to arrange for the Accused to meet with the directors at Fuur’s office in late November 2016. At the same time, steps were taken to obtain the images of some of the cheques from the bank to confirm who the payees were. It was later found that all the cheques were paid to the Accused.[^63]

60     According to Jessica, the Accused initially declined to attend the meeting. However, she relented after Jessica informed her that there was evidence of the payments made to her, and, if she did not explain, a police report would be made. Jessica was not present at the meeting.[^64]

61     Jessica testified that the payment voucher files she retrieved from Fuur also contained salary vouchers. In particular, she confirmed that the salary vouchers in P8-1 to P8-34 were found in the payment voucher files she retrieved from Fuur’s office.[^65]

62     Jessica also gave evidence that she put up the salary lists in Exhibits P17-1 to P17-33 by referring to Fuur’s salary vouchers and the CPF contribution printouts in Fuur’s CPF files, both of which were prepared by the Accused.[^66] Jessica could not remember when she prepared the salary lists, but testified that it was done using Microsoft Excel, after the police report had been lodged. She had signed at the bottom of the salary lists in the presence of a police officer. She had also retained a softcopy of the same in her office computer but could not remember if anyone else had access it.[^67]

#### Irregular features of the falsified documents

63     Jessica confirmed that she had retrieved P9 to P15 from the payment voucher files which she brought to Summer Production’s office from Fuur’s premises. Jessica explained that when she attended at Fuur’s office once or twice a month, she did not go through the payment voucher or CPF files.[^68]

64     Jessica took the Court through P9 to P15 and highlighted features in each document which caused her to pull them out from the files. In particular, for the payment vouchers in P9 to P12 and the invoice in P15, Jessica was unable to tell who the payments were made to. As for the invoice in P13 which was addressed to Fuur, she noticed that the “authorised signature” column bore the Fuur stamp and to her, it meant that Fuur had authorised the issuance of the invoice to itself. Finally, in relation to the invoice in P14 for “designer fee”, she needed to confirm whether Fuur had indeed paid a third party for design work.[^69]

65     When shown Exhibit D6, Jessica agreed that it was similar to a sample invoice format which she provided to the Accused. This was to be used for payment to an individual service provider (such as a photographer). However, there were differences between D6 and the format provided by Jessica. Jessica also disagreed that this invoice format was used to record payments to Fuur’s staff which was not captured in their salary vouchers.[^70] Jessica had also provided another sample invoice format similar to the one in P13, but with slight differences. This was also used to record payments by Fuur to third parties who did not issue their own invoices.[^71]

### Evidence of employees of Fuur

66     Five witnesses who were working in Fuur at about the same time as the Accused also testified at the trial. The following is an outline of their evidence:

#### PW3 – Chia Shu Ying (“Shu Ying”)

67     Shu Ying worked as an industrial designer with Fuur from November 2011 to August 2014. During her employment, she was paid monthly and was given year-end bonus based on the performance of the company. Shu Ying would sign a salary voucher when she received her salary. She did not receive commissions or other forms of payment during her employment with Fuur. However, she could make claims for transportation, medical fees and purchase of stationery. After her resignation, Shu Ying did some freelance work for Fuur in relation to an on-going project she was previously involved in. The project concerned a boutique hotel in Ubud, Bali, called “Bisma 8”. Shu Ying issued the two invoices in Exhibits P18 and P19, for $900 and $600 respectively, to Fuur. Shu Ying confirmed that she did not issue the invoice in P14 and did not receive the payment of $2,400 stated therein. She had also never seen a document with a format resembling P13.[^72]

#### PW4 – Khoo Kean Hu (“Kean Hu”)

68     Kean Hu worked as a designer in Fuur for about four years from 2013 to 2017 and was paid his salary on a monthly basis. Kean Hu would sign a salary voucher when he received his salary. He also recalled being paid “small” year-end bonuses of about $500 each, twice during his four years with Fuur. He was reimbursed for transportation claims but never received any commissions from Fuur. Kean Hu had also never seen documents resembling P13 or D6 before. [^73]

#### PW5 – Chen Weiqiang Spencer (“Spencer”)

69     Spencer started working as an architectural designer for Fuur on a freelance basis before 2014 and was paid monthly. He also received small bonuses (of about $500) every three to six months, depending on Fuur’s performance. Spencer would sign a receipt (similar to the one in P12) when he received his renumeration and/or bonus. The receipt would be accompanied by an invoice similar to that in P13 which would itemise the details relating to the payment. Spencer was not paid a commission but could make claims for transportation and medical fees.[^74]

#### PW6 – Zhuang Mingtong (“Mingtong”)

70     Mingtong worked in Fuur from September 2015 to August 2016 as an architectural designer. When Mingtong received his monthly pay cheque, the Accused would give him a salary voucher (similar to that in P8-7) to sign and Mingtong would keep a copy of the voucher. Mingtong did not receive any other remuneration or bonus payments from Fuur. Mingtong added that while he was not familiar with a document like P9 or D6, a template similar to P13 was used for his payslip while he was on probation. However, it was not titled “Invoice”.[^75]

#### PW7 – Ngu Ping Hwei (“Ping Hwei”)

71     Ping Hwei worked at Fuur as an architectural designer from 2013 to 2016. Ping Hwei was paid a fixed salary each month and would occasionally receive a bonus of about $300 to $400. Ping Hwei would receive his pay cheque with a salary voucher (like that in P8-7), and he would sign on the voucher. Ping Hwei recalled that the reimbursements for his transport claims were also captured in the salary voucher and he had not seen documents in the same format as P9, P13 or D6 before.[^76]

## The case for the defence

72     At the close of the prosecution’s case, I found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused on the proceeded charges and called upon her to give evidence in her own defence. The Accused elected to testify, and she was the sole witness for the defence.

### DW1 – Nithiya d/o Harithas

#### The Accused’s employment with Fuur

73     The Accused testified that she worked for Fuur from 19 November 2012 to 1 November 2016. During cross-examination, the Accused clarified that she had worked for both Fuur and Suprette until June 2016. Initially, the arrangement was for Fuur and Suprette to each bear half of her salary, with Suprette paying her directly and Fuur paying Suprette their share (see Suprette’s salary vouchers in P8-1 to P8-6). The Accused agreed that as of January 2014, based on P8-1, her basic pay was $1800 while her employer’s and employee’s contributions to CPF were $288 and $360 respectively. Hence, her take-home pay would be about $1,440. However, from July 2014 onwards, Suprette and Fuur decided to pay her salary separately.[^77]

74     According to the Accused, Exhibits D4-1 to D4-6 were the original copies of her Fuur salary vouchers.[^78] She explained that Fuur’s salary vouchers would include the following sections:

> (a)     Earnings – which set out the salary which would be subject to CPF deduction;

> (b)     Deductions – which stated the CPF deduction; and

> (c)     Additions – which set out any bonus and reimbursement which would not be subject to CPF deduction.[^79]

#### Changes to the Accused’s job scope and remuneration

75     The Accused was initially hired by Fuur as an administrative assistant and only dealt with data entry and filing. After she became a confirmed employee in February or March 2013, she was given additional responsibilities in human resource and accounting. At that time, Jasper taught the Accused how to issue cheques and payment vouchers as well as bookkeeping. In late 2013, the Accused was given “secretarial” work which entailed her issuing invoices to clients for projects and chasing them for payments.[^80] During cross-examination, the Accused agreed that her job scope also included stocking up office supplies such as cleaning supplies, snacks and stationery.[^81]

76     Sometime in the second half of 2013, the Accused’s family was on the brink of losing their HDB flat as they had defaulted on payments for four to five years. As the Accused had a very good working relationship with Dean and Jasper, she told them about her financial situation and asked for her salary to be split into two portions so that she could have more cash in hand. A few days later, Dean and Jasper informed the Accused that they would accede to her request. Accordingly, a portion of her salary amounting to $920 would be designated as “reimbursement” for which no CPF deduction would be made. However, the Accused’s salary remained the same.[^82]

77     Later in the second half of 2013, the Accused also started receiving regular renumeration that was not recorded in her salary vouchers. According to the Accused, Dean and Jasper had a discussion with her about taking over the secretarial work. The secretarial job would require the Accused to oversee the office staff and ensure everyone was coming in on time. She also needed to ensure that payments were issued on time, billings were done in a staggered manner, and funds were received on time. Dean and Jasper felt that they were too busy with their projects to do these things.

78     According to the Accused, she was reluctant to accept the added responsibilities at first as she felt that she was already doing administration, human resource and accounts work and it would be unfair for her to do the work which would normally require four to five headcounts to perform. As such, the Accused told Dean and Jasper that it was not possible for her to do all these on her $2300 salary. Moreover, the Accused felt that with her N-levels qualification and an ITE NITEC certificate in office skills, she did not have the paper qualifications to execute the tasks. In fact, she had to learn on the job from Jasper. The Accused also told them that for her to do the job with such great responsibility, it would only be fair if they were to pay her the market rate salary for a secretary.[^83]

79     The Accused testified that Dean and Jasper were not happy with her response. However, after further discussion, they offered the Accused a salary range of $3,500 to $5000 and told her that if she started with a lower salary, there would be gradual increments. After considering the offer, the Accused agreed to accept the job with the pay rise. However, as the Accused had financial problems as the sole breadwinner of her family, she asked Dean and Jasper to split her salary in the salary voucher into two components, such that only one portion would be CPF deductible. Specifically, the Accused requested that the pay increment not be CPF deductible and that it be paid to her separately in a different cheque. Dean and Jasper eventually agreed to these payment terms and since then, the Accused would receive two cheques per month for her remuneration and her salary would be reflected in a salary voucher and a salary invoice respectively. Although the Accused could not recollect the amount paid to her via a salary invoice (“invoice salary”), she confirmed that the range was between $2,400 to $3,400 during the period from late 2013 to 2016.[^84]

80     During cross-examination, the Accused agreed that Fuur was all along a small company comprising fewer than ten employees. However, she was of the view that one person should be employed specifically for the purpose of issuing cheques to the staff and directors.[^85] The Accused also acknowledged that with the invoice salary of $2,400 in January 2014, she was paid more than double her previous salary and, from being the lowest paid, she became the highest paid employee in Fuur. The Accused did not know why the invoice salary was not included in the non-CPF deductible portion of her salary voucher. She testified that as she did not have the basic qualifications to do the job, she merely followed the directions of Dean and Jasper. The Accused also agreed that she was the only employee in Fuur who received substantive payments which were not reflected in the salary vouchers.[^86]

#### Payment and administrative practices in Fuur

81     The Accused testified that certain payments to the directors of Fuur, such as transport allowance, entertainment expenses and commissions would not be reflected in the salary vouchers. Similarly, bonuses, transport claims and medical and dental claims paid out to employees would also not be captured in their salary vouchers. Instead, in 2013, such ad hoc payments would be recorded in payment vouchers. From 2014, with Jessica’s involvement, all such claims would be reflected in either of the two invoice templates created by her.[^87]

82     According to the Accused, the format of a payment voucher would be similar to that in P9. However, the Accused noted that she would usually leave the voucher number column at the top right corner blank as Fuur did not have an invoice numbering system at that time. The Accused said that the payee’s full name would be stated in the payment voucher except for payments made to the cleaning lady by way of a cash cheque. For payments made to the Accused, the description of payment would be stated as “professional fees”. The Accused also stated that Fuur did not have a “posted” stamp as seen in P9. In addition, it was her practice to write the amount paid in block letters in “the sum of dollars” field. The “payment approved by” field would be signed by Dean or Jasper but if they forgot to sign, the Accused would endorse it with the official stamp. The payee would sign at the “received by” field but for cheques sent out by post, the “by hand” stamp would be used.[^88]

83     As for P13, the Accused testified that it was one of the two invoice templates introduced by Jessica sometime in January 2014, to replace the payment voucher. According to the Accused, in the soft-copy template, the “to” field was already pre-populated with Fuur’s address while the “attention” field should contain the payee’s name. As such, her name would appear in the “attention” field if the invoice recorded a payment to her. A “posted” stamp would be applied to the filed copy of an invoice when the invoice details had been keyed into the MYOB system. The Accused added that if the invoice was for payment to her, the description column would state “professional fees”. When an invoice had been paid, the Accused would apply the “paid” and date stamps and write the cheque number and amount paid. Similar to the payment voucher, the “authorised signature” field should be signed by Dean or Jasper but if they omitted do so do, the Accused would apply the official Fuur stamp. The recipient of the payment would also sign on the invoice.[^89]

84     The Accused testified that D6 represented the other template created by Jessica. Based on Jessica’s instructions, the “invoice number” field in this template would be filled up by stating the invoice date backwards. Similarly, Fuur’s address would be stated in the template and the “attention” field would state the payee’s name. As D6 was “invoiced to” the Accused, the “description” column would state the year of the professional fee.[^90] The Accused pointed out however, that D6 did not require a signature, unlike P13. As such, it would usually be used for third-party payments.[^91]

85     The templates in P13 and D6 would also be employed when making payment to third parties who did not issue their own invoices to Fuur. This was done to account for every cheque issued.[^92] If the invoice was for a third-party payment, the cheque would usually be sent by post. In such a case, the Accused would make a photocopy of the invoice, and send it by mail with the cheque. However, in most instances, the payee would collect the cheque from Fuur’s office and would sign on the invoice to acknowledge receipt.[^93]

86     The Accused added that when Fuur’s cash flow was tight, the salary payments to employees would be prioritised, followed by payment to the Accused if there were sufficient funds. Otherwise, payment to the Accused would be held back, together with those for the directors.[^94]

87     According to the Accused, she was the only employee in the office who would prepare cheques for Dean and Jasper to sign. The payee fields on the cheques were always filled in and there was never any instance during her employment with Fuur that this was left blank. For salary vouchers, the directors would sign the “approved by” field but if they omitted to do so, the Accused would apply the Fuur stamp (as seen in D4-1) to signify that it was a legitimate payment.[^95]

88     The Accused testified that she was in a WhatsApp group chat called “FA + admin” with the directors of Fuur. The group chat was used, from time to time, to discuss various matters including bank balances, incoming and outgoing payments, matters concerning interns, payment of bonuses, pay increments, cash flow and staggered payments. It was also the Accused’s job to monitor Fuur’s bank account and ensure there were sufficient funds for overheads and necessities, and the Accused would issue an alert when cash was low. Usually when cash was low, Dean or Jasper would give instructions to stagger outgoing payments. The Accused would also do her best to chase clients for payments.[^96] In fact, Dean was the one who was more observant and careful when it came to cash flow and would be the first to notice payment discrepancies or anything amiss in the office.[^97]

89     The Accused recalled that her monthly invoice salary was discussed in the WhatsApp group chat, but she had deleted the chat shortly after her last day at work on 1 November 2016.[^98]

90     The Accused testified that Fuur received hardcopy monthly bank statements from OCBC. The Accused would collate all the documents relating to the transactions reflected in the bank statements and attached them to the latter. She would then record all the transactions in the MYOB system. Once that was done, she would leave the bank statements and supporting documents at the directors’ desk and notify them via the WhatsApp group chat that the documents were ready for their review.[^99]

91     The Accused explained that the payment voucher files in Fuur would contain salary vouchers, payment vouchers and invoices addressed to Fuur. Fuur also maintained bank statement files.[^100]

92     According to the Accused, she had recorded her monthly invoice salary in the MYOB system. The payment would be described as “professional fees” with the month and year stated and the entry would include the cheque number and reflect her name as payee. During cross-examination, the Accused denied keying in these payments as “cash” payments in the MYOB system.[^101]

93     According to the Accused, Jessica would come to Fuur’s office from time to time, sometimes weekly and sometimes once a month, to generate reports for the directors of Summer Productions. She would usually stay between 45 minutes to two hours each time. In the earlier days when Fuur started using the MYOB system, Jessica would check every record keyed in by the Accused against the documents in the files. However, Jessica stopped doing so after July or August 2014 and the Accused would instead liaise with her via email for assistance to delete any erroneous entries.[^102] During cross-examination, the Accused elaborated that in the first few months after introducing the MYOB system, Jessica would come to Fuur’s office every day. Jessica also came to generate reconciliation reports on a weekly basis. However, after a while, she came once in two weeks or a month. Each time, Jessica would countercheck the MYOB entries with the physical payment voucher files.[^103] The Accused further explained, during re-examination, that every six or seven months, Jessica would stay for a few hours in Fuur’s office to run through all the documentation, and if any transaction did not make sense to her, she would check the payment voucher file.[^104]

#### The payments in the disputed cheques

94     According to the Accused, her name was stated as payee in all the cheques in P1 to P7 when they were presented to Dean for signature. Specifically, P1 and P2 were for a $5000 payment to the Accused which was authorised by Dean and Jasper sometime in November or December 2013. This was given to the Accused as the “administrative portion fee” for a project called “Bisma Eight” in Ubud, Bali. As Fuur was facing cashflow issues at that time, Dean and Jasper instructed the Accused to split the sum into two cheques so as to stagger the payments.[^105] During cross-examination, while the Accused agreed that none of the designers who worked on the project received any additional fee, she said that it was the directors who proposed to give her $5000 from the total project cost while they also took a commission. As such, the Accused merely followed their instructions to issue the payment to herself in two cheques. She had encashed the two cheques within three days of each other, on 13 and 15 January 2014 respectively.[^106]

95     The Accused testified that she did not raise the payment vouchers in P9 and P10 to support these payments to her. The voucher number fields were not written by her and the date of the voucher in P10 should have been stamped. The handwritten word “designer” was struck out in P10 whereas if the Accused had made a mistake, she would discard the voucher and create a new one. The signatures appearing at the “payment approved” fields also did not belong to her. In addition, if the vouchers were genuine, the “pay to” fields would bear her name and she would have signed the “received by” column if she had received the cheques. Also, “the sum of dollars” field would have been filled up in block letters instead of being struck off as “NIL”. The “posted” and date stamps appearing in the centre of the documents were also not the ones which the Accused had used.[^107]

96     According to the Accused, she had prepared the cheques in P3 to P7 for payment of her monthly invoice salary but the supporting documents in P11 to P15 were not prepared by her. In particular, P11 and P12 bore similar discrepancies as those found in P9 and P10. In addition, the correct description of the payments would have been “professional fees”.”[^108] During cross-examination, the Accused testified that certain hand-written parts of P9 to P12 bore similarities to her handwriting.[^109]

97     In relation to P13, the Accused testified that there were two discrepancies, namely that the description of the payment should have been “professional fees” and the date above the “paid” stamp would also have been stamped instead of handwritten. The Accused testified that “Ms Danielle” mentioned in P13 was an intern employed by Fuur for a few months.[^110] In response to queries from the Court, the Accused confirmed that the cheque number and amount stated below the “paid” stamp were in her handwriting.[^111]

98     As for P14, an invoice for payment to the Accused would not have stated “designer fee” in its description.[^112] However, the Accused confirmed that the cheque number and the amount written below the “paid” stamp were in her handwriting.[^113]

99     With regard to P15, the Accused’s evidence was that the invoice for her remuneration would not include the words “freelance” in the description.[^114] Nonetheless, she confirmed that the letters “OCBC” (excluding the cheque numbers) and the amount written below the “paid” stamp were in her handwriting.[^115]

100    According to the Accused, she was given a pay increment of $200 to $600 every three to six months. The sum of $2800 in P7 reflected an increase in her pay from the previous amount of $2400 (as seen in P3 to P6). The Accused explained that her salary in the salary voucher would remain constant while the invoice salary would increase to ensure that her total remuneration would commensurate with the salary range agreed between her and Fuur’s directors.[^116] During cross-examination, the Accused testified that generally all staff in Fuur would also enjoy a pay rise every three to six months. While the pay increment for the Accused usually ranged between $200 to $300, the salary jump for the designers could be up to $400 to $500. The Accused confirmed that her invoice salary remained at $2400 throughout 2014.[^117]

#### Irregularities in the salary vouchers

101    Referring to P8-7 to P8-34, the Accused testified that she was not sure if the signatures in the “received by” fields were hers. In particular, the Accused could not recognise the signatures in P8-26 and P8-28. She added that contrary to P8-31, the “received by” field was never left unsigned. In addition, the stamp appearing in P8-7 was not the official Fuur stamp but one which was used by the designers to endorse the drawings they submitted to clients.

102    In the Accused’s view, P8-7 to P8-31 were not genuine copies of her salary vouchers retained by Fuur. However, in response to queries by the Court, the Accused clarified that the cheque number in P8-28 was written in her handwriting. As such, only the signature was not genuine but all the other details in the document appeared to be in order. [^118] During cross-examination, the Accused confirmed that the cheque numbers in the salary vouchers in P8-7 to P8-34 were written by her but they were all signed by someone else to acknowledge receipt. The Accused believed that these salary vouchers were created after her departure from Fuur.[^119] However, during re-examination, the Accused clarified that when she confirmed that the cheque numbers were written by her, she was referring to the handwriting and not confirming that the documents were raised by her.[^120]

103    Regarding her signature, the Accused testified that the signature appearing in D4-1 to D4-6 was her only signature and she used the same for her own bank transactions. Her signature was actually a combination of the letter “B” and the word “Nelly”. However, when shown her signature on the back of the cheques in P1 to P3, the Accused acknowledged that they looked different and the word “Nelly” could not be seen. She explained that she signed quickly at the bank counter and it looked a little messier.[^121]

#### The Accused’s departure from Fuur and the allegations against her

104    According to the Accused, it was not her intention to resign but she was asked to leave with 24 hours’ notice. The Accused was informed by Jasper that her salary was too high and due to Fuur’s financial circumstances, they could not afford to pay her. As of her last day of service with Fuur, the Accused was not told about any suspicions relating to forgeries or falsifications.[^122]

105    However, in the last week of November 2016, when the Accused was enquiring if she could bank in her last salary cheque (which was for her salary voucher remuneration), Jessica responded with a WhatsApp message accusing her of fraud and forgery committed during her employment with Fuur. Jessica added that they found evidence and asked the Accused to attend at the office to clarify; otherwise, the case would be reported to the police or the Commercial Affairs Department.[^123]

106    The Accused denied the allegations but attended the meeting at Fuur the following day. Dean, Jasper, Charles, Alvin and another Chinese man were present. Alvin threw a file containing documents onto the table and asked the Accused what she had done. The Accused responded that she did not do anything wrong and offered to clarify. However, the Accused was not allowed to explain but was told to admit her crimes. The Accused refused to admit and challenged Alvin to call the police. Although the discussion was heated, the Accused recalled that Dean said that he was very disappointed in the Accused while Jasper and Charles remained largely silent. The Accused left the meeting after Alvin said that they would report the matter to the police. Sometime later that day, the Accused received a call from her family and was told that five men had gone to her home to question her parents and demand repayment of $109,000. After rushing home to calm her parents, the Accused proceeded to lodge a police report regarding the incident (Exhibit D9).[^124]

## Analysis of the evidence and the Court’s findings

### The Accused’s entitlement to the payments and related issues

107    As stated earlier in these grounds, the Accused’s receipt of the amounts in P1 to P7 was not in dispute. However, her entitlement to these payments went to the heart of both the prosecution’s and defence’s cases. Hence, it would be expedient to begin my analysis by examining the evidence in this regard.

108    To recap, the prosecution’s case was that the Accused was not entitled to the payments in P1 to P7, and that her rightful monthly remuneration was that reflected in her salary vouchers. The defence, on the other hand, alleged that the payments in P1 to P7 represented the Accused’s “invoice salary”, or ad hoc payments for work done by her in specific projects. It was the defence’s contention that these payments were rightfully due to the Accused, in addition to the monthly salary reflected in her salary vouchers.

109    Having carefully reviewed and considered the evidence on this issue, I found that the Accused was not entitled to the payments in P1 to P7. I found her explanations for the payments to be far-fetched and contrived. Not only were the material parts of the defence’s case concerning an increased job scope and the payment of administration fees for the Bisma 8 project not put to Dean, the Accused’s version in relation to these payments also did not sit well with the objective evidence or accord with reason and common sense. I shall further explain.

110    Firstly, I was not persuaded by the Accused’s contention that sometime in the second half of 2013, the directors of Fuur had offered to more than double her salary because she was asked to undertake additional “secretarial work”. In this regard, it was pertinent to note that the evidence before the Court did not bear out any substantial increase in workload or responsibilities placed upon the Accused which would justify a significant pay increment. Indeed in describing the “secretarial work” as overseeing “all the administrative, accountancy and the finance of the company”[^125] the Accused was clearly inflating the extent of her responsibilities and scope of her work in an attempt to justify the meteoric pay rise allegedly given to her.

111    That this was an untenable contention was even more evident when, during cross-examination, the Accused took the position that one person should be employed specifically for the purpose of issuing cheques to the staff and directors in Fuur. As pointed out by the prosecution in their submissions, it was most telling that when Jessica stepped in to take over the work the Accused claimed would require “four to five headcount” to perform, Jessica’s unchallenged evidence was that she only required half a day per week to complete the administrative tasks.[^126] Indeed if the directors of Fuur had been prepared to pay the Accused additional salary of $2400 or more, it would surely have made much better commercial sense to hire an additional staff instead.

112    The alleged two-fold pay rise was all the more unbelievable in light of the Accused’s testimony that she was actually not qualified to perform the additional role that Fuur’s directors had allegedly foisted on her. According to the Accused, when she first started working for Fuur as a confirmed employee in early 2013, she had to learn on the job and it was Jasper who trained her on how to issue cheques and payment vouchers as well as on bookkeeping skills. It was therefore unsurprising that the Accused could not offer any cogent explanation as to why her pay far outstripped those of the other employees of the firm when she was not performing any billable work.

113    Secondly, I found the Accused’s claim regarding the payment of $5000 to her as administrative fee for the Bisma 8 project to be an afterthought. In this connection, I observed that the defence’s case put to Dean was a general one -- that the payments in P1 and P2 were ad hoc payments to the Accused for work she had done in “certain projects”. It was thus interesting to note that when the Accused testified during the defence case (after Shu Ying had made specific reference to the Bisma 8 project), the Accused said that both payments in P1 and P2 related to the same.

114    Further, the Accused did not proffer any explanation for the $5000 accorded to her when the other designers who were involved in the project did not receive extra payments; save to state that she was merely following the directors’ instructions. Indeed, the amounts Shu Ying invoiced Fuur in September 2014 for the same project paled in comparison to the amount received by the Accused. [^127]

115    The Accused also did not provide the Court with any details of the work she had done for the project to be paid $5000 on top of both her monthly salary and invoice salary for the same month.[^128] In my view, it was implausible that Fuur’s directors would offer to pay the Accused about $9000 in total in January 2014 when, according to her, Fuur was experiencing cash flow issues at the material time.

116    Thirdly, the Accused’s claim that the payments in P3 to P7 were part of her monthly remuneration from Fuur was unsupported by any documentary or objective evidence. The evidence led during the trial from both Dean as well as the employees of Fuur clearly indicated that:

> (a)     the monthly salary of all full-time employees were set out in their salary vouchers; and

> (b)     those who performed work on a freelance basis would receive their remuneration via an invoice which was issued by them (as in the case of Shu Ying) or generated by Fuur (as in the case of Spencer).

117    In view of the above, even if Fuur’s directors had agreed to the Accused’s request that her salary increment not be subject to CPF deductions and be paid to her in a separate cheque, there was no reason for this component of her salary to be omitted from her salary voucher. This was all the more so when it was undisputed that her salary voucher already reflected a portion of her salary which was not subject to CPF deductions. When the Accused was questioned pointedly about this during cross-examination, she resorted to repeating her lack of “basic qualifications” to do the job and that she was “just following instructions” given by Dean or Jasper.[^129] Curiously, it was never put to Dean that the directors of Fuur had given specific instructions to omit this component of the Accused’s salary from her salary vouchers. Neither was it put to Dean that the directors of Fuur had agreed to a request from the Accused to split her monthly salary into two separate cheques.

118    In my view, it was most telling that the Accused’s invoice salary was also not included in Fuur’s salary list in Exhibit D5, which, according to the defence’s case put to Jessica, was prepared by the Accused during the time she was employed at Fuur.[^130] The omission of the Accused’s invoice salary was all the more glaring as Spencer’s monthly remuneration, which was paid via an invoice similar to that in P13, was included in D5 for the months of January 2014 to November 2015. In the course of her testimony, the Accused made no attempt to explain why her monthly invoice salary was not reflected in the salary list allegedly prepared by her.

119    Fourthly, it was interesting to note that in July 2016, the Accused’s net salary was reduced to $1200 (D4-6 and D5). This was presumably because she worked fewer hours when she started working part-time in July 2016.[^131] However, in the same month, she continued to be paid additional invoice salary of $3,300 (see PS2). In fact, PS2 also revealed that in September 2016, the month just before the Accused claimed to be summarily dismissed because her pay was “very high” and Fuur could not afford to pay her any more, her invoice salary further increased to $3400. If, as the Accused claimed, these were all legitimate salary payments specifically instructed by the directors of Fuur to be accorded to her, and, by all accounts, they had all along enjoyed a cordial working relationship[^132], there would have been no reason for the directors to turn around and falsely accuse her of fraud right after she left their employment.

120    I should add that my findings were not solely premised upon the fact that the payments were not recorded in her salary vouchers. Rather, my analysis was centred on the justifications or reasons for such payments, in light of the Accused’s claim that they were additional salary or ad hoc payments granted to her by Dean and Jasper. As was evident from the analysis set out above, the fact that these payments were not recorded in the salary vouchers was but one of the many factors I had taken into considered in the course of my deliberations.

121    I also wish to highlight that in considering the evidence on the issue of the Accused’s entitlement to the relevant payments, I had carefully studied the defence’s submissions in relation to the credibility and reliability of Dean’s evidence. In particular, I had closely scrutinised the following allegations of the defence concerning lies or inconsistencies in Dean’s testimony:[^133]

> (a)     Dean lied in giving evidence that he never received any payment from Fuur that was not reflected in his salary vouchers, and was contradicted by his affidavit in D2.

> (b)     Dean lied in giving evidence that, in a normal month in 2014, he received one or at most two cheque payments from Fuur, and was contradicted by his affidavit in D2.

> (c)     Dean lied in giving evidence that he never used the word “commissions” to describe his remuneration, and was again contradicted by his affidavit in D2.

> (d)     Dean lied in giving evidence that Fuur’s employees received no payment whatsoever that was not reflected in their salary vouchers, and was contradicted by the evidence of the ex-employees;

> (e)     Dean lied in giving evidence that Fuur only used salary vouchers to record payments to Fuur’s personnel, not any other type of document, and was contradicted by the evidence of Spencer and Mingtong;

> (f)     Dean lied in giving evidence that Fuur did not describe payments to its designers as “professional fees” or “designer fees”, and was contradicted by Mingtong;

> (g)     Dean lied in giving evidence that Fuur did not use an “invoice” format to record payments to Fuur’s suppliers or service providers, and this was undermined by the evidence of Jessica.

122    Having reviewed the defence’s contentions as well as Dean’s evidence, it was apparent to me that the alleged lies or inconsistencies pertained mainly to details concerning administrative or documentation practices dating back several years. I was of the view that the inconsistencies or contradictions arose in part due to human fallibility in observation and recollection, and in part due to unfamiliarity on the part of Dean with the day-to-day administrative nitty-gritties in Fuur. In my view, these inconsistencies did not evince any dishonesty on the part of Dean when testifying in Court. On the contrary, it reinforced Dean’s refrain that he was really busy and focused on managing and designing projects, and had entrusted the administrative and paperwork to the Accused. On a broader note, it was, to my mind, not useful to focus on issues such as naming conventions of payments in Fuur and whether all manners of payments made to Fuur employees were captured in their salary vouchers. To do so would detract from the central issue of whether the payments in P1 to P7 were legitimately due to the Accused. Based on my analysis above, I had no difficulty in accepting Dean’s evidence that the Accused was not entitled to the payments in P1 to P7.

#### The WhatsApp Group Chat

123    In support of the defence’s case that the payments in P1 to P7 were legitimate, the Accused claimed that her monthly invoice salary was discussed in the Whatsapp group chat between her, Dean and Jasper, but she had deleted the chat shortly after her last day of work with Fuur on 1 November 2016.

124    During cross-examination, Dean agreed that there was such a group chat but that he had similarly deleted it in October or November 2016, after the Accused’s departure from Fuur. The defence alleged that Dean lied about when he deleted the WhatsApp group chat in his phone as he had given inconsistent versions both in Court as well as in his affidavit (D3) filed in the civil suit. The defence further alleged that Dean’s motive in lying was that he knew that the group chat contained material that corroborated the Accused’s defence and he wanted to conceal the WhatsApp group from the Court.[^134]

125    Having carefully reviewed Dean’s testimony, I was of the view that the perceived discrepancies highlighted by the defence, as to the precise month Dean deleted the WhatsApp group chat, were immaterial and did not suggest any attempt on Dean’s part to hide the chat from the Court. Objectively speaking, as Dean and Jasper were the only other members (aside from the Accused) in that group chat, there was no need for them to retain the chat for communication purposes after the Accused’s departure. Thus, just as the Accused had deleted the chat upon her leaving Fuur, it was not illogical or unreasonable for Dean to have done the same.

#### The other cheques in the stood down charges

126    In their submissions, the defence also relied on the fact that Dean (and Jasper) had allegedly signed a total of 34 cheques from January 2014 to September 2016, which were paid to the Accused, as “similar fact evidence“ to bolster the defence’s case that these payments were genuine remuneration for the Accused.[^135]

127    In my view, the argument was misconceived. While it was not disputed that besides P1 to P7, the Accused had prepared and received payment from another 27 cheques belonging to Fuur (see PS2), it was _not an agreed fact_ that Dean or Jasper had signed all these cheques. Further, not only were the other 27 cheques the subject matter of the stood down charges on which the Accused was not tried, the allegation that some of these cheques were not signed by Dean was raised by him as early as December 2016 when he filed the police report in P16. As pointed out by the prosecution in their submissions, such cheque payments also did not take place every month as there was no payment in August 2014.[^136]

128    Thus, having carefully considered the 34 payments made to the Accused, I was of the view that they did not negate the prosecution’s case that they were illegitimate.

#### Jasper was not called as a witness

129    In their submissions, the defence also made much of the fact that Jasper was not called to testify during the trial.[^137] Specifically, the defence was of the view that Jasper’s evidence was critical in three areas, namely:

> (a)     to state whether he was a party to the agreement with the Accused for Fuur to pay her amounts not recorded in her salary vouchers;

> (b)     to explain the circumstances in which he indisputably signed cheques payable to the Accused for amounts not recorded in the Accused’s salary vouchers; and

> (c)     to state whether the WhatsApp group chat contained discussions on payments to the Accused for sums not recorded in her salary vouchers, whether he was still in possession of the group chat, and if not, under what circumstances he lost such possession.

130    The defence referred to the case of _PP v Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 984</span> and urged the Court to find that the prosecution had failed to discharge its evidential burden on the material facts in issue. Alternatively, the defence submitted that the Court should draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for failing to call Jasper, a material witness, to testify at the trial.

131    Having carefully considered the evidence before the Court and parties’ submissions on this point, I was of the view that this was not a case where the prosecution had failed to adduce _sufficient_ evidence to rebut a specific defence raised by the Accused. In particular, the Accused’s defence was that she was rightfully entitled to the payments in P3 to P7 based on an agreement reached between her, Jasper and Dean. As set out in my earlier analysis in these grounds, I found that there was more than sufficient evidence to support the prosecution’s case that there was no such agreement and that the Accused was not entitled to the payments in question.

132    Moreover, the cheques purportedly signed by Jasper were not the subject matter of the proceeded charges before the Court. As such it would not be necessarily for the prosecution to call Jasper to testify concerning those cheques in the current proceedings.

133    In my view, it would also not be appropriate for the Court to draw an adverse inference that Jasper’s evidence, if led, would have been adverse to the prosecution on the facts in issue. This was because, the current case was not one in which the Court and the defence were left in the dark concerning Jasper’s position on the matter. On the contrary, the defence had access to, and had admitted into evidence three affidavits jointly affirmed by Dean and Jasper (dated 18 August 2017, 4 October 2017 and 18 July 2019 respectively) which were filed in the civil suit which Fuur had initiated against the Accused. The affidavits clearly evinced a common position adopted by Jasper and Dean, which was contrary to the defence’s case.

### The forgery charges

134    Having dealt with the overarching issue of the Accused’s entitlement to the payments in P1 to P7, I move on to look at the specific offences in the proceeded charges.

#### Elements of the offence

135    In relation to the forgery charges, section 467 of the Penal Code stated:

> 467.  Whoever **forges a document which purports to be a valuable security** or a will, or an authority to adopt a child, or which purports to give authority to any person to make or transfer any valuable security, or to receive the principal, interest, or dividends thereon, or to receive or deliver any money, movable property, or valuable security, or any document purporting to be an acquittance or a receipt, acknowledging the payment of money, or an acquittance or a receipt for the delivery of any movable property or valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years, and shall also be liable to fine.

>     (emphasis added)

136    Section 463 of the Penal Code defined forgery as follows:

> 463.  Whoever **makes any false document** or electronic record **or part of a document** or an electronic record with intent to cause damage or injury to the public or to any person, or to support any claim or title, or to cause any person to part with property, or to enter into any express or implied contract, or **with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed, commits forgery**.

>     (emphasis added)

137    Section 464(1)(a) of the Penal Code explained what it meant to make a false document:

> 464.—(1)    A person is said to make a false document or false electronic record —

>> (a)    who **dishonestly** or fraudulently —

>>> (i)     **makes**, signs, seals or executes **a document or part of a document**;

>     …

>      **with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document** or electronic record **or part of a document** or electronic record or electronic signature **was made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made**, signed, sealed, executed or affixed, or at a time at which he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed

>     (emphasis added)

#### The key issues

138    As it was not disputed that the cheques in P1 to P7 were valuable security under section 467 of the Penal Code, and that the Accused was the one who inserted her name as payee in each of the cheques, the key issues to be decided by the Court were (a) whether the Accused had inserted her name as payee without authority after Dean had signed the cheques; and (b) whether she was dishonest and intended to commit fraud in doing so. In view of my findings above that the Accused was not entitled to the payments in P1 to P7, the Courts’ decision on the forgery charges would ultimately turn on issue (a).

139    In this regard, the prosecution’s case was that Dean had signed the cheques in P1 to P7 with the payee field left blank and was unaware that these cheques were for payment to the Accused. The defence’s position was that the Accused had written her name as payee before Dean signed the cheques and Dean did so knowing full well that these were for payments to her.

140    It was therefore unsurprising that Dean was subjected to intensive and detailed cross-examination by the defence in relation to the specific circumstances under which he signed the cheques.

#### Assessment of Dean’s evidence

141    In Court, Dean was clear and unwavering in his evidence that he signed the cheques in P1 to P7 when the payee field was left blank, and that he was unaware that these were for payments to the Accused. His evidence in this regard remained unshaken during cross-examination. As pointed out earlier in these grounds, Dean had steadfastly maintained, since lodging the police report (P16) on 1 December 2016, that the Accused had presented him with cheques for which the amount for payment would be filled in but the name of the payee was left blank. It was also noteworthy that Dean averred to the same regarding P1 to P7, in his and Jasper’s joint affidavit dated 18 August 2017 (D1).[^138]

142    In their closing submissions, the defence alleged that Dean had lied in:

> (a)     giving evidence on the documents that allegedly accompanied P1 to P7 when they were presented to him for signature; and

> (b)     giving evidence that there were “no situations” in which he would be presented with a single cheque to sign.

143    The defence also embarked on an in-depth analysis of the documents which could have accompanied the cheques in P1 to P7 when they were presented to him for signature. These included:

> (a)     For P3 to P7 - salary vouchers of another employee whose salary cheque was for the same amount as the Accused’s invoice salary;[^139]

> (b)     For P1 and P2 - documents relating to rent, photographer’s fees, instalment payment for printer, or other vouchers;[^140]

144    The defence submitted that it was “fanciful” to suggest that the Accused could have induced Dean to sign P1 to P7 in this manner as Dean would either have noticed that something was amiss because the same supporting document would be used to support more than one cheque or the amount stated in the supporting document would not tally with that in the cheque.

145    Having carefully examined Dean’s evidence in detail, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that his testimony should be read and understood in the context of his primary role as an architect and designer in Fuur and the fact he was not actively involved in the day to day administrative aspects of the business.[^141] As highlighted by the prosecution, the following exchange in relation to P1, during the early part of Dean’s evidence-in-chief, evinced Dean’s position that he was speaking generally as he was unable to recall the specific documents accompanying each cheque:

> Q    Now we are speaking of this particular cheque at page 7, which is at exhibit P1. You said it would be presented. These documents would be presented to you. So, do you recall exactly which document presented? Or are you speaking generally?

> A    I’m speaking generally.

> Q    So for---

> A    As an---as an office protocol. I’m speaking generally.

> Q    So, for this particular cheque that’s on page 7, can you remember the specific supporting document that she gave to you?

> A    Uh, Your Honour, I cannot---uh, because this is quite some time ago. It’s, uh, 5 years ago. I can’t exactly pinpoint hard---with---uh, with absolute clarity. Um, the actual supporting document pertinent to this, uh, P1. But I can say with absolute clarity that this is not, uh, an official, uh, documents entitled to her. It would, um, most possibly be for a paid design, uh, design staff as I mentioned before. A draftsman or a junior designer for instance.[^142]

146    In addition, Dean had also testified that he was unable to recall exactly what the Accused told him the payments in the cheques related to:

> Q    So the numerical value would be filled, the pay column would be left blank. And what would Nithiya say to you when she presented the cheque to you?

> A    The usual rhetoric was, Your Honour, uh, that she has forgotten to fill in under the pay column. And this was, uh, quite consistent.

> Q    What purpose did she tell you this cheque was for?

> A    The purposes, uh, vary, um, but the---they---it was all ranging from either a staff’s pay to our monthly rent. As we’re renting from, uh---yes, uh, we’re---as we are renting a shop house. But it was all, uh, structured as, uh, legi---legitimate payments for FUUR Associates.

>     …

> Q    So earlier you said that she would tell you the purposes vary but it’s generally for legitimate payments for FUUR Associates? For this particular cheque, do you remember the exact reason that she told you the payment was for?

> A    This is quite, uh, some time ago, Your Honour. So please pardon my memory as well. Um, by looking at this, I do believe it was for 1 of the design staff, employed under FUUR Associates.

> Q    So when she told you that she forgot to pay---to write the payee name in the payee col---column. And that it was for a legitimate payment for FUUR Associates. What did you do?

> A    I recalled very clearly that I’ve asked her specifically, uh, over a number of times, uh, why this was so---that the payee’s column was missing, Your Honour. And, um, I’ve always asked her about that and, um, and reminded her to please filled in the payee’s, uh, column.[^143]

147    In my view, the fact that Dean could not readily recollect with precision as to how he was led to sign the cheques in P1 to P7, did not render his credibility suspect or his testimony on the material facts unreliable. On the contrary, bearing in mind that Fuur was only alerted to the suspicious transactions in late 2016, Dean’s inability to recall such details accorded with general human experience and was testament to the trust he had in the Accused. Given that there was no reason for Dean to be suspicious of her at the time he signed the cheques, there was also no reason why he should commit the specific circumstances to memory.

148    Dean had also consistently testified that it was not his nature (nor did he have the time) to go through the documents in detail when signing the cheques presented to him by the Accused. Instead, he would glance through the documents and, so long as the numerical values in the cheques corresponded with his general recollection of the amounts regularly paid out by Fuur, he would sign them.[^144] It was also not Dean’s evidence that he would scrutinise the documents closely when he found a cheque with the payee field left blank. His evidence was that he would merely ask the Accused why the payee was not filled in:[^145]

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

Thank you for your clarification. I just want---one more further question in terms of clarification. So this is wa---how you do it generally. But do you do anything differently when you see a blank in the cheque? For---

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

As---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

payee?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

Um, regrettably, no, Your Honour. Um, and as I mentioned before, the only thing that I did was to ask Nithiya why the payee name was not filled in. Which, uh, she gave me her reason. And uh, I basically trusted her, Your Honour. …

 |

  
  

149    In my view, Dean’s trusting and broad-brush approach for such routine administrative tasks would also go towards explaining why he did not discover any anomalies or discrepancies in the supporting documents at the material time.

#### Findings on the forgery charges

150    Having carefully scrutinised the evidence, I accepted Dean’s testimony that he had signed the cheques in P1 to P7 when the payee field was left blank and that he did not know nor intend for the cheques to be paid to the Accused. I also found, as a fact, that the Accused had inserted her name as payee, without authority, after the cheques had been executed by Dean.

### The falsification charges

#### Elements of the offence

151    In relation to the falsification charges, section 477A of the Penal Code stated:

> 477A. Whoever, being a clerk, officer or servant, or employed or acting in the capacity of a clerk, officer or servant, wilfully and with intent to defraud destroys, alters, conceals, mutilates or **falsifies any book, electronic record, paper, writing, valuable security or account which belongs to or is in the possession of his employer**, or has been received by him for or on behalf of his employer, or **wilfully and with intent to defraud makes** or abets the making of **any false entry in**, or omits or alters or abets the omission or alteration of any material particular from or in **any such book, electronic record, paper, writing, valuable security or account**, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both.

>      _Explanation._—It **shall be sufficient in any charge under this section to allege a general intent to defraud** without naming any particular person intended to be defrauded, or specifying any particular sum of money intended to be the subject of the fraud or any particular day on which the offence was committed.

>      _(emphasis added)_

#### The key issues

152    It was not disputed that the Accused was employed by Fuur at the time the alleged offences in the falsification charges were committed. It was also not disputed that P9 to P15 were spurious and the payment descriptions were false. Thus, the key issues to be decided by the Court were (a) whether P9 to P15 were in the possession of Fuur at the material time; and (b) whether the Accused had made the false entries in P9 to P15, as specified in the falsification charges.

153    The prosecution’s contention was that P9 to P15 were falsified and placed in Fuur’s files by the Accused to cover-up the wrongful payments made to her in P1 to P7. The defence however alleged that the documents were fabricated by persons associated with Fuur to support the trumped-up allegations against the Accused.

#### Assessment of Jessica’s evidence

154    It was pertinent to note that it was Jessica, who was not an employee of Fuur, who first noticed irregularities in the MYOB records and retrieved the falsified payment vouchers and invoices from the payment voucher files belonging to Fuur. In my view, the manner in which Jessica discovered the documents, while she was going through the records in detail in the course of taking over the Accused’s work, accorded with reason and logic.

155    In their submissions, the defence attempted to cast doubt on Jessica’s credibility by alleging that she had deliberately lied in the following aspects of her evidence:[^146]

> (a)     Jessica lied in testifying that all payments by Fuur to its staff were recorded in salary vouchers;

> (b)     Jessica lied in testifying that Fuur did not issue “self-addressed” invoices;

> (c)     Jessica lied in her evidence on the amount of time she spent and what she did whenever she visited Fuur’s premises; and

> (d)     Jessica lied in her evidence on the circumstances in which the salary lists P17-1 to P17-33 were prepared.

156    Having studied Jessica’s testimony very carefully, I disagreed with the defence’s interpretation of her evidence and their allegations that she had lied in Court. Firstly, in relation to whether Jessica lied in testifying that all payments by Fuur to its staff were recorded in salary vouchers, Jessica’s testimony should be read in the context of the questions asked of her, which was focused on whether the invoice template was used to record payments by Fuur to its own staff[^147]:

> Q    I see. So, this document which you call an invoice---

> A    Yes.

> Q    will record payments by Fuur Associates to certain kinds of third parties am I---

> A    Yes.

> Q    correct? These kinds of third parties would be for instance service providers who don’t really have a formal company.

> A    Yes, because Fuur Associates sometime we will employ some freelance designer.

> Q    I see. **Another purpose for a document such as or rather the doc---the format that you have told us, does it also include recording payments to Fuur Associates’ internal staff that are not captured in their salary voucher?**

> **A**      **No.**

> Q     **So, even miscellaneous payments to internal Fuur Associates’ salary staff such as reimbursements, everything you say will be captured in the salary voucher but not in this invoice.**

> **A**      **Yes.**

>     (emphasis added)

157    In addition, contrary to the defence’s assertion that Jessica’s evidence was directly contradicted by the testimony of Mingtong and Spencer[^148], their evidence was in fact entirely consistent with Jessica’s -- that their salaries were recorded in an invoice template similar to that in P13 while they were on probation or working freelance respectively. Jessica’s evidence that the invoice template was not used to record payments to Fuur’s employees also found support in the evidence of Shu Ying, Kean Hu and Ping Hwei, all of whom testified that they had never seen a document resembling P13 before.

158    Secondly, in relation to “self-addressed” invoices, I found no internal inconsistencies in Jessica’s testimony. Jessica had testified that she had pulled out P13 because the Fuur’s stamp appeared in the “authorised signature” field of the document, and this, to her, indicated that it was Fuur issuing an invoice to itself. Her position was that the billing party’s signature should appear in this field instead.[^149] In my view, this was not in any way contrary to her evidence that she provided an invoice format, which was addressed to Fuur, for the use of vendors or service providers who did not issue their own formal invoices.[^150]

159    Thirdly, having compared Jessica’s evidence concerning what she did during the time she spent in Fuur’s office against that Dean’s testimony, I did not consider any differences between their accounts of Jessica’s activities in Fuur to be material in nature. In any event, it was clear from the evidence that Jessica was not a Fuur employee and did not report to Dean when she attended at Fuur’s office. Further it was undisputed that Dean would be out of the office either for the whole day or part of the day on two or three days each week Thus, it was not surprising that Dean would not be familiar with the frequency of Jessica’s visits to Fuur’s office or the specific tasks she undertook each time she was there during the two year period from 2014 to 2016. It was also interesting to note that during her examination-in-chief, the Accused’s evidence dovetailed Jessica’s evidence in this regard. The Accused testified that Jessica came to Fuur’s office sometimes weekly but sometimes only once a month and she would usually spend less than two hours each time. The reason why Jessica came to the office was to generate reports for the directors of Summer Productions. The Accused also testified that while Jessica would check the records keyed in by the Accused when the MYOB system was first introduced, she stopped doing so after July or August 2014. Instead, whenever the Accused realised that she had made a mistake, she would liaise with Jessica through email to edit the entry.[^151]

160    As for Jessica’s evidence concerning the preparation of the salary lists in P17-1 to P17-33, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that just because there were some differences between the salary lists in P17 (which bore Jessica’s signature at the bottom right of each page) and those served by Fuur’s solicitors to the Accused’s lawyers in D5, it did not mean the Jessica had lied about how she had prepared P17. In this regard, it was pertinent to note that Jessica’s evidence was that she could not remember seeing the salary lists in D5 before. She also could not recall sending a soft copy of P17 to anyone by email, or if anyone else had access to it.[^152] Given the passage of times since the events took place, I did not find Jessica’s inability to account for the differences between P17 and D5 to be suspicious or to indicate dishonesty on her part. On a related note, I observed that while the defence had repeatedly put to Jessica that it was the Accused who prepared the salary lists in D5 while she was still employed in Fuur,[^153] the Accused did not give such evidence during the defence case.

161    Having carefully analysed Jessica’s evidence, I was of the view that she was a credible witness who had testified in a straightforward and forthright manner and who had no reason to lie against the Accused. I was satisfied that she was telling the truth concerning how she found entries in the MYOB system indicating “cash” payments in the “professional fees” account and retrieved the related payment documents (including those in P9 to P15) from Fuur’s payment voucher files.

#### Disputed handwriting in P9 to P15 and other issues raised by the defence

162    In support of their allegation that P9 to P15 were fabricated by Fuur, the defence also pointed to various hand-written entries and alleged that they were not written by the Accused.

163    First of all, the defence highlighted the voucher numbers in P9 to P12 and argued that the handwriting was clearly dissimilar to that of the Accused’s. In addition, the Accused asserted that some of the other handwritten entries in P9 to P15 were also not in her handwriting and that some of their contents were not in keeping with her own administrative practices in Fuur.

164    In considering this issue, it was pertinent to note that the falsification charges did not assert that the Accused had falsified each and every entry in the documents. Instead, the charges alleged that she had made the following specific entries (which were undisputedly false) relating to the descriptions of the payments:

165    In my view, the fact that the voucher numbers could have been written by someone else did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the documents were fabricated by Fuur. Similarly, Dean’s signature in P10 was neither here nor there, and did not detract from the prosecution’s case that the false entries in the documents were the Accused’s handy work.

166    On the contrary, it was interesting to note that the Accused gave evidence that some of the handwriting found in P9 to P15 were similar to her own. In particular, for P13 to P15, the Accused had testified that, amongst other things, the handwritten amounts were in her handwriting. This, to me, rendered it highly unlikely for the documents to have been concocted by Fuur after her departure.

167    In addition, I could not agree with the defence’s submission that P9 to P15 were easily discoverable and did not contain a hint of any attempt to evade detection.[^154] The facts of the case showed that the disputed payments to the Accused went undetected for several years, and only came to light after her departure from Fuur. Indeed, even when the documents including P9 to P15 were retrieved by Jessica from Fuur’s files, her evidence was that she was still unable to tell who the payments were made to. It was only after obtaining copies of the cheques from the bank did it become apparent that the payments were all made to the Accused.

168    The defence also alleged that the salary vouchers in P8-1 to P8-34, which Jessica claimed to have retrieved from Fuur’s payment voucher files, were spurious and that there was a reasonable possibility that they were fabricated by Fuur.[^155] Curiously, although the defence had put to Jessica that the copies of P8-1 to P8-6 she retrieved from the payment voucher files should not have contained an annotation above the Accused’s IC number, the Accused did not give any evidence in support of this position. As for P8-7 to P8-34, although the Accused disputed the signatures appearing in the “received by” fields, she confirmed that the cheque numbers in P8-7 to P8-34 were all written by her.

169    In my opinion, there was really no reason for Fuur to fabricate the Accused’s salary vouchers, especially since:

> (a)     the Accused would have filed a copy of her salary vouchers in Fuur’s payment voucher files;

> (b)     there was no dispute as to the salary details and amounts stated in P8-1 to P8-34; and

> (c)     P8-1 to P8-6 were not even Fuur’s salary vouchers but were undisputedly prepared by the Accused and approved by Varian Lim, a partner in Suprette.

170    Thus, I accepted Jessica’s evidence that P8-1 to P8-34 were retrieved by her from Fuur’s payment voucher files, and rejected the defence’s suggestions that they were fabricated by Fuur.

#### Findings on the fabrication charges

171    I now return to the key issues at hand. As highlighted by the prosecution in their closing submissions, it was undisputed that:[^156]

> (a)     the Accused was the only employee in Fuur who was tasked to file the records of payments in Fuur’s payment voucher files;

> (b)     the Accused was also solely in charge of entering the details of each payment into the MYOB system; and

> (c)     the Accused had prepared and received payment from all the cheques associated with P9 to P15.

172    The above undisputed facts, taken together with Jessica’s evidence on the discovery of the documents, as well as my earlier finding that the Accused was not entitled to any of these payments, led to the irresistible inference that the Accused was the one who had made the false entries in P9 to P15 relating to the payment descriptions as specified in the falsification charges.

## The Accused was convicted of the proceeded charges

173    In conclusion, having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven both the forgery and fabrication charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found the Accused guilty and convicted her of all 14 proceeded charges.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Punishment

174    Section 467 of the Penal Code provided that an offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 15 years and shall also be liable to fine.

175    The prescribed punishment for an offence under section 477A of the Penal Code was imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or a fine, or both.

### Antecedents

176    The Accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

177    The prosecution tendered written submissions on sentence and pressed for a global sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment.

#### Sentence for the forgery charges

178    The prosecution began by submitting for a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for each of the forgery charges under section 467 of the Penal Code.

179    The prosecution argued that for offences where property was obtained by way of forgery, the quantum involved would be representative of the harm caused by the offence as well as the gain by the offender. In this case, the seven cheques were forged over a period of more than one year and were for sums ranging from $2400 to $2800.

180    Referring to the decision in _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> at \[39\] and \[43\], the prosecution identified the following aggravating factors in the present case and pressed for a deterrent sentence against the Accused:

> (a)     the forgery offences were premeditated with a significant degree of planning as the Accused had offended repeatedly, adopting the same _modus operandi_; and

> (b)     the period of the offence reflected the Accused’s recalcitrance.

181    The prosecution contended that the offences were further aggravated by the Accused abusing the significant trust that Dean had reposed in her. The Accused was given sole charge to prepare cheques and maintain the books and records for Fuur. This was so even after the MYOB system was introduced by Jessica. The high degree of trust could also be seen from Dean repeatedly accepting her explanations on why the payee field of the cheques were left blank as well as the purposes of the cheques.

182    The prosecution then proceeded to set out the details of three sentencing precedents: _PP v Nuraishah Binte Junid_, _PP v Angnes Tan Mei Qing_, and _PP v Martin Raymond Tua Pardede_ (all unreported), and observed that offenders who pleaded guilty to similar offences of forging cheques received sentences of between 4 to 6 months’ imprisonment for charges involving $2500 to $6500.

183    In this case, the prosecution proposed a starting point of 4 months’ imprisonment on account of the amount involved in the seven forged cheques. It was further submitted that at uplift to at least 6 months’ imprisonment per charge would be appropriate, as the Accused had claimed trial and should not be given any sentencing discount afforded to the offenders in the precedent cases.

#### Sentence for the falsification charges

184    Turning to the falsification charges under section 477A of the Penal Code, the prosecution asked for a sentence of at least 3 months’ imprisonment per charge.

185    Citing the case of _Tan Puay Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 390</span> (“_Tan Puay Boon_”) at \[47\] and \[50\], the prosecution submitted that the following three aggravating factors were present in this case:

> (a)     there was abuse of trust (as submitted earlier);

> (b)     the offences were committed for the Accused’s personal gain, and the falsified documents were filed into Fuur’s records by the Accused to cover up her forgery offences; and

> (c)     the Accused’s _modus operandi_ demonstrated that the offences involved a degree of deviousness and surreptitious planning on her part. In this connection, the Accused had lied to Dean about why she left the payee fields of the cheques blank. She then lied to him as to the purposes of those cheques. Finally, she filed the falsified documents to account for the cheque payments, including subsequently making false entries in the MYOB system when it was introduced in Fuur.

186    The Accused had also demonstrated a stark lack of remorse when she made spurious allegations during the trial, by claiming that the falsified invoices and payment vouchers were created by Fuur to frame her for the offences.

187    The prosecution referred to _Tan Puay Boon_ and _PP v Noriza Binte Aziz_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 157</span> as sentencing precedents and submitted that offenders who committed similar offences under section 477A of the Penal Code where all three aggravating factors were engaged, received sentences of between 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment. As such, it was submitted that at least 3 months’ imprisonment per charge would be appropriate in this case.

#### Global sentence

188    Finally, the prosecution submitted for the sentences in three charges (two under section 467 and one under section 477A of the Penal Code) to run consecutively. This was because:

> (a)     the Accused has been convicted on a total of 14 charges;

> (b)     the offences spanned a significant period of more than one year; and

> (c)     a deterrent sentence ought to be imposed.

189    In addition, ordering the three sentences to run consecutively would not run foul of the one-transaction rule as the offences involved differently protected legal interests, occurred at different times and related to the forgery of different cheques.

190    The prosecution submitted that the resultant global sentence of at least 15 months’ imprisonment, for offences involving a total of $17,400, would be appropriate and proportionate.

### Mitigation & Defence’s submissions on sentence

191    The defence tendered a written plea in mitigation and submissions on sentence together with a bundle of authorities, and asked that the Court impose an aggregate sentence of no more than 11 months’ imprisonment. This comprised a term of imprisonment of not more than 5 months for each forgery charge, a term of imprisonment of not more than 1 month for each falsification charge, and an order that the sentences in two of the forgery charges run consecutively with the sentence in one of the falsification charges.

#### Sentence for the forgery charges

192    The defence referred to the Practitioners’ Library: Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) which set out the following governing considerations in sentencing for a forgery offence: the nature of the document, the amount involved, elements of planning and organisation, the period over which the offence was committed, and the abuse of position. These factors were cited with approval by the Court in _PP v Malinda Wongpipatkasem_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 197</span> (“_Malinda_”), where the Court further noted that the main sentencing consideration must be one of deterrence.

193    The defence highlighted the cases of _Malinda_, _PP v Muhammad Fairuz Bin Mohamed Ali_ (“_Fairuz_”, unreported) and _PP v Wong Huey Min_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 287</span> as sentencing precedents. The defence pointed out that in the present case, the quantum involved in each charge was small. Therefore, the Court’s decisions in _Malinda_ and _Fairuz_ were especially relevant as those cases also involved the forgery of cheques of small quanta.

194    The defence further submitted that there were no aggravating factors in this case, save for, perhaps, the relationship between Fuur and the Accused. As the element of abuse of relationship of trust was also present in all three sentencing precedents, any uplift to the Accused’s sentence must be minimal.

195    In addition, while the Accused could be said to be more culpable than the offender in _Malinda_, in that she did not plead guilty and did not make any restitution, the two cases were similar as both offenders were untraced.

196    In view of the above, the defence submitted that the sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment per charge meted out in _Malinda_ for forgery of cheques worth $6,000 each, was a useful indicative starting point for calibrating sentence in the present case. To account for the lack of restitution and the fact that the Accused had claimed trial, an uplift of 2 months’ imprisonment should be applied, resulting in a sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment per charge under section 467 of the Penal Code. The defence further submitted that this sentencing position was consistent with the sentence passed in _Fairuz_ especially since the present case, unlike those in _Malinda_ and _Fairuz_, did not involve theft of the cheques or chequebooks. In addition, although the quantum in _Fairuz_ was higher[^157], a small uplift to the sentence of 18 weeks in _Fairuz_ should apply in the present case, to account for the fact that there was no actual loss suffered in _Fairuz_.

#### Sentence for the falsification charges

197    Turning to the falsification charges, the defence submitted that the decision in _PP v David John Kidd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 83</span> (“_John Kidd_”) was instructive. At \[24\] of the decision, the Court held that the starting point for calibrating the appropriate sentence for such an offence must take into consideration the factors identified by the High Court in _Tan Puay Boon_, namely:

> (a)     whether there was deviousness or surreptitious planning in the commission of the offence;

> (b)     whether the falsifications were committed for one’s personal gain;

> (c)     whether there was an abuse of trust; and

> (d)     the amount involved in the falsifications.

198    In relation to the extent and manner of planning involved, it was submitted that the Accused did not take any measures to “cook the books” or defraud the authorities, and her actions could not be characterised as surreptitious, egregious and sophisticated. At best, they were attempts at concealment which could have been easily detected. Therefore, little weight, if any, should be accorded to this factor in this case.

199    As for abuse of trust, it was submitted that due to the manner in which a charge under section 477A of the Penal Code was framed, there would always certainly be an abuse of trust. What was relevant would then be the extent and severity of the abuse.

200    In _John Kidd_, the Court noted that an employee’s place in a company’s hierarchy must be taken into account to determine the severity of the abuse of trust. In that case, the Court found the offender, who was a junior trader with two years’ experience, to be less culpable than the offender in _Tan Puay Boon_, who was not just a financial executive but had been in the company for 16 years and was invited to be a shareholder and director of a related company. In the present case, the Accused was only an administrative staff of Fuur who had been employed for about three years. She was not given any managerial tasks and her role in the company hierarchy was low. Accordingly, although there was breach of trust, it was not especially egregious or severe. Therefore, it was submitted that little weight should be accorded to this factor in calibrating sentence in this case.

201    Finally, it was submitted that the amounts involved in the falsification charges paled in comparison to the total sum involved in _John Kidd_ (which was in the region of $1,042,012).

202    Following from the above, the defence contended that the Accused was less culpable than the offender in _John Kidd_ in respect of all four sentencing considerations. Given that the Court in _John Kidd_ imposed a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment for a charge relating to a cover up of approximately $46,904 in trading losses, it was submitted that the defence’s sentencing position of 4 weeks’ imprisonment per charge was just, appropriate and consistent with the precedents.

#### Global Sentence

203    The defence submitted that the proposed global sentence of 1 year’s imprisonment would not offend the totality principle and urged the Court to sentence the Accused accordingly.

### Prosecution’s reply

204    In their oral response to the defence’s submissions, the prosecution noted that the parties were not too far apart in their sentencing positions for the forgery charges. As for the falsification charges, the prosecution observed that the case of _John Kidd_, which the defence relied on, was very different from the present case. The falsifications in _John Kidd_ were for the purpose of covering up trading losses which the offender had incurred, and the offender did not personally gain from the falsifications committed. Further, he was principally motivated to improve the company’s financial position in carrying out those trades. This was unlike the present case where the Accused committed the falsification charges to cover up the offences of forgery from which she had personally benefitted. The prosecution submitted that the present case was in fact much more similar to that in _Tan Puay Boon_ where the falsification offences were committed for personal gain. As such, the 3 month imprisonment term imposed in _Tan Puay Boon_ would be the more appropriate guide.

### Defence’s response

205    The defence countered that _John Kidd_ was very relevant for consideration as the covering up of the losses were in breach of various legal obligations on the part of the company and the offender. Therefore, this remained a serious aggravating factor despite the fact that, technically, the offender did not obtain personal pecuniary gain. In addition, the amount of losses covered-up, which was the subject matter of each charge, was high. As for _Tan Puay Boon_, the defence emphasised that there were various distinguishing factors including a very sophisticated scheme, and a significantly higher degree of abuse of position and trust.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Sentencing considerations & principles

206    In calibrating sentence in this case, I first considered the appropriate sentences for the individual forgery and falsification charges.

##### (1)   Sentence for forgery charges

207    In relation to the forgery charges, I noted that both parties considered essentially the same set of sentencing factors, and arrived at similar sentencing positions.

208    Having carefully studied both parties’ submissions, I agreed with the prosecution that the forgery offences in this case, which were committed over a period of more than one year, were clearly premeditated and involved a significant degree of planning on the part of the Accused.

209    I also concurred with the prosecution’s submissions that the Accused had abused her position and breached the trust reposed in the her by Dean. In this regard, I had carefully considered the defence’s argument that little weight should be accorded to this factor as the Accused was merely an administrative staff who had worked at Fuur for about three years. In my view, the degree or extent of abuse of trust by the Accused should not only be measured by the seniority of the position she held. The Court should also consider the nature of the role she played, especially in the context of a small firm like Fuur. Based on the evidence in this case, the Accused was clearly regarded as a trusted employee in Fuur as she was the only member of the staff charged with preparing Fuur’s cheques for payment. Aside from the directors, she was also the only one who had access to the cabinet where Fuur’s records and files were kept, as well as the only person who was tasked to file and maintain the records of payments. That the Accused was a trusted employee was further amplified by Dean’s testimony in Court as to why he signed the cheques even though the payee fields were not filled in. Indeed, the Accused gave evidence that at her meeting with the directors of Fuur and Summer Productions, Dean told her that he was very disappointment in her. Thus, while I agreed with the defence that the breach of trust in this case was not exceptionally egregious or severe, I could not agree that little weight should be accorded to this factor in calibrating sentence.

210    With the above in mind, and having considered that the amounts involved in the forgery charges to be relatively small, I reviewed the sentencing precedents submitted by both parties. In doing so, I found the three sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution apposite as they similarly involved employees who breached the trust of their employers by forging the companies’ cheques over a period of time, to make payment to themselves. The following is a summary of the sentences meted out in the respective precedents for individual charges under section 467 of the Penal Code:[^158]

211    Having reviewed the sentencing precedents carefully, I was in broad agreement with both parties that the starting sentence for a charge under section 467 of the Penal Code, involving a sum of around $2,400 to $2,800, where the offender was untraced, had pleaded guilty, but had not made any restitution, would be in the region of 3 to 4 months’ imprisonment. Taking into account the usual discount accorded to an offender who had pleaded guilty as a sign of genuine remorse, I applied an uplift to the starting sentence to arrive at the sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment per charge in this case.

##### (2)   Sentence for the falsification charges

212    I next turn to consider the sentence for the falsification charges. In this connection, the parties were in broad agreement that the following sentencing factors highlighted in _Tan Puay Boon_ were pertinent:

> (a)     whether there was deviousness or surreptitious planning in the commission of the offence;

> (b)     whether the falsifications were committed for one’s personal gain;

> (c)     whether there was an abuse of trust; and

> (d)     the amount involved in the falsifications.

213    However, the parties diverged on the degree or extent to which the first three sentencing factors set out above were engaged in the present case; and this resulted in very different assessments of how this case compared with _John Kidd_ and _Tan Puay Boon._

214    Having scrutinising the parties’ submissions in this regard, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that the offences committed by the Accused involved a degree of craftiness and surreptitious planning on her part. The Accused had falsified various payment vouchers and invoices to cover up her forgery offences. The exhibits in P9 to P15 showed that the Accused had clearly taken pains to inject some “variety” into the falsified documents, by employing diverse document types, templates and payment details, so as to create a veneer of legitimacy and authenticity. This, coupled with the fact that she was entrusted with maintaining the payment records, helped to ensure that her offences went undetected for more than a year. In view of the above, I could not agree with the defence’s submissions that these were mere attempts at concealment which could have been easily detected.

215    I was also of the view that the falsifications in this case were committed for personal gain -- to disguise the cheque payments which the Accused had wrongfully caused to be made to her.

216    Further, as I have observed earlier in these grounds, the Accused had abused the trust of her employers in committing the offences. While I agreed with the defence that the breach of trust in this case was not exceptionally egregious or severe, I was of the view that appropriate weight should nonetheless be accorded to this factor in calibrating sentence.

217    Turning to the sentencing precedents, and having reviewed the cases of _Tan Puay Boon_ and _John Kidd_, I found the former to be more helpful and relevant in considering the appropriate sentence in this case.

218    The factual matrix in _Tan Puay Boon_ bore various similarities to those in the present case. In _Tan Puay Boon_, the offender was tried and convicted on eight charges under section 477A of the Penal Code for falsifying entries in salary rolls and payment vouchers belonging to the company she was working for. The offender was originally employed as a clerk who was tasked with finance and administrative work. Around the time of the offences, she was promoted to “Finance and Administration Executive” and appointed a director of a related company. During the trial, the offender did not dispute making the false entries but alleged that she was instructed to do so by the managing director of the company so that other employees would not know of her high salary – which she claimed had been increased from $2,900 to $6,500 over the years. In that case, the trial judge found that the offender had exaggerated the quantum of her gross salary[^159]. In convicting the offender, the trial judge also found that she had falsified the documents to mask the unauthorised payments to herself. The offender was sentenced to a global term of 36 months’ imprisonment. Specifically, she was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment per charge on the four falsification charges involving amounts between $1020.50 and $2,511. The individual and global sentences were upheld by the High Court on appeal.

219    On the other hand, I found the facts and circumstances of the case in _John Kidd_ to be rather distinct from the present case. The offender in _John Kidd_, pleaded guilty to five charges under section 477A of the Penal Code for making false entries in electronic records of the company which employed him as an oil trader. The false entries were made to conceal trading losses incurred by the offender due to his failure to conduct hedging trades as required. The offender in _John Kidd_ was sentenced to a global term of 36 weeks’ imprisonment, which took into account the two weeks the offender spent in remand.[^160] In particular, the Court imposed a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment per charge on the four charges for falsification to cover up losses between USD34,440 (S$47,284) to USD58,020 (S$78,631). In calibrating sentence, the Court in _John Kidd_ recognised that while the offender had speculated on market conditions in order to improve the financial performance of the oil trading contract he was in charge of, he knew that he would be financially incentivised by the company if the contract did well and was concerned that he would lose his job if the contract continue to perform poorly. On the other hand, the offender did not receive any actual monetary benefits from his misdeeds and the Court was of the view that this lack of monetary benefit contrasted strongly from cases such as _Tan Puay Boon_, where offenders derived significant gains from their offences.[^161] Another major point of difference noted by the Court between _John Kidd_ and cases such as _Tan Puay Boon_, was that the falsification offences in _John Kidd_ were not committed to cover up other offences committed by the offender.[^162] The Court proceeded to review the “Mitsui Oil cases” in _PP v Takayoshi Wada_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 162</span>, _PP v Takahashi Masatsugu_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 265</span> and _PP v Noriyuki Yamakazi_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 118</span> and found them to be a lot more helpful in deciding the appropriate sentence as all of them shared many similarities with _John Kidd_, including the fact that the offences were committed to cover trading or business losses which were not themselves the result of criminal acts of the offenders.

220    In the same vein, I found that the facts in _John Kidd_ were quite dissimilar with the facts in the present case as the Accused had received actual monetary benefits from her offences and the falsification offences were committed to conceal her other criminal acts. As such, as compared to _John Kidd_, I found the case of _Tan Puay Boon_ to be more germane and cogent in deciding on the appropriate sentence in this case.

221    Turning back to _Tan Puay Boon_, while I agreed with the defence that there was a greater extent of detail and sophistication in planning and execution of the falsification offences, and more egregious breach of trust in that case, I noted that both cases involved offenders who had committed the offences for personal gain. In addition, the amount involved in the individual charges in the present case were higher than those in _Tan Puay Boon_ for which the sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment were meted out. Further, although a larger total quantum was involved in _Tan Puay Boon_, this would be considered by the Court in deciding on the total aggregate sentence, rather than the sentence for individual charges.

222    For the above reasons, and after balancing all the sentencing factors, I was of the view that it would be fair and just to sentence the Accused to 3 months’ imprisonment per charge on each of the falsification charges.

#### Sentence imposed

223    The Accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:

224    I further agreed with both parties that the sentences in two forgery charges should run consecutively with that in one falsification charge. I therefore ordered the sentences in DAC-924287-2017, DAC-924302-2017 and DAC-924321-2017 to run consecutively and the rest of the sentences to run concurrently.

## Conclusion

225    The total net sentence was therefore _13 months’ imprisonment._ In my view, this sentence was proportionate to the Accused’s culpability and sufficient for the purpose of deterrence.
