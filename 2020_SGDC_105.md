24 April 2020

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Charge and Sentence

The Accused, a 52 year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to an offence of consumption of a specified drug under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), Chapter 185. The charge is set out as follows:-

> _“You, are charged that you, on or before 27 August 2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, morphine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the said Act, and further_,

> _that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 24 October 2012 in District Court No. 6, vide DAC 34152/2012, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, morphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed) and punished under Section 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you are thereby liable to be punished under Section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev Ed)._

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty on the charge and convicted him. The Accused was sentenced to a term of 7 years’ imprisonment - the minimum sentence prescribed for the offence.

3       The Accused brings this appeal against the order of conviction only.

## The Prosecution’s Case

#### Statement of Agreed Facts

4       The Prosecution’s case was encapsulated within a comprehensive 5-page Statement of Agreed Facts[^1]. The key agreed facts were:

> 4.1     On 27 August 2018, the Accused reported for his routine urine test at the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) Office as he was a drug supervisee. The Accused was attended to by CNB narcotics officer SSgt Wong Kai Zheng Lester.[^2]

> 4.2     On the instructions of SSgt Lester Wong, the Accused provided a urine sample for his routine urine test. The urine sample was analysed on the Instant Urine Test (IUT) machine for Opiates by CNB narcotics officer Sgt Haiqal Bin Fozi Altway. It tested positive for Opiates[^3].[^4]

> 4.3     Thereafter, the Accused was instructed by SSgt Lester Wong to provide another urine sample into another master bottle, chosen by himself. The Accused did so. After capping the master bottle tightly and ensuring that was no leakage, SSgt Lester Wong handed the master bottle to the Accused. On further instruction, the Accused poured about 30 ml of his urine sample contained in the master bottle into each of the two empty urine containers he had chosen. Both the urine containers were then capped tightly by SSgt Lester Wong, sealed and placed into a Ziplock bag. The Ziplock bag was in turn, sealed with masking tape. All these were done in the Accused’s presence. The Accused then held onto the Ziplock bag.[^5]

> 4.4     The Accused was subsequently escorted into the IUT room again. After verifying the identity of the Accused, Sgt Haiqal printed a new barcode containing the Accused’s full particulars and pasted the label on a new empty test tube upon confirming with the Accused as to his particulars. Thereafter, Sgt Haiqal siphoned the remainder of the Accused’s urine in the master bottle into the new empty test tube. Sgt Haiqal then tested the urine for Opiates, Amphetamines, Cannabis and Benzodiazepines. The Accused’s urine sample tested positive for Opiates and Benzodiazepines[^6].[^7]

> 4.5     Sgt Haiqal then generated two Health Sciences Authority (HSA) labels, bearing the Accused’s name, NRIC number, urine specimen numbers and date of urine procurement and handed them to SSgt Lester Wong. The Accused confirmed the details on the labels as accurate and appended his signature on each of the two HSA labels in SSgt Lester Wong’s presence.[^8]

> 4.6     Thereafter, in the presence of the Accused, SSgt Lester Wong cut open the Ziplock bag, removed the Accused’s two urine containers and affixed one HSA label on each urine container. The urine samples were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SE-18-00623-1 ZAKARIA BIN HASHIM SXXX” and “C-SE-18-00623-2 ZAKARIA BIN HASHIM SXXX”, The Accused then deposited each urine container into a locked metal security box. These two locked metal security boxes were placed into the CNB refrigerator and the refrigerator locked.[^9]

> 4.7     The next day on 28 August 2018, CNB narcotics officer SSgt Mohammad Fazuri Bin Isnin delivered the two locked metal security containers to the HSA for analysis.[^10]

> 4.8     On 31 August 2018, Ng Chee Ann, an analyst at the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate under section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) bearing Lab. No. AT-1833-08351-001-01, stating that the urine sample marked “C-SE-18-00623-1 ZAKARIA BIN HASHIM SXXX” was analysed and found to contain morphine[^11]. On 3 September 2018, Goh Mei Ling Evelyn, another analyst from the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA bearing Lab. No. AT-1833-08351-002-01, stating that the urine sample marked “C-SE-18-00623-2 ZAKARIA BIN HASHIM SXXX” was analysed and found to contain morphine[^12].[^13]

> 4.9     On 1 October 2018 at about 11:00 am, when the Accused reported to CNB office for another routine urine test, he was placed under arrest[^14] on suspicion of having consumed a specified drug by CNB narcotics officer Inspector Muhammed Ridlwan Bin Mohamed Raffi.[^15]

5       The Statement of Agreed Facts set out in detail the procurement process of the Accused’s urine at every stage. There was no irregularity alleged by the Defence in respect of the manner in which the Accused’s urine was obtained. There was also no challenge raised in relation to how the Accused’s urine samples were handled each step of the way and eventually conveyed to the HSA for analysis. The analysis of the Accused’s urine samples and certificates issued by the HSA were similarly accepted by the Defence. None of the witnesses mentioned in the Statement of Agreed Facts and listed in the Prosecution’s list of witnesses were required for cross-examination.

6       The Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions of the Accused was also admitted into evidence by way of agreement as Exhibit P5[^16].

7       The Prosecution called only two witnesses, PW1 Inspector 2 Pek Ji Hua, the Investigating Officer of the case and PW2 Chin Shi Liy Reenie, an HSA analyst. The evidence of these two witnesses related more to the Accused’s defence than to the Prosecution’s case.

#### Two Prosecution Witnesses

8       PW1 Insp Pek gave evidence that a total of four statements were recorded from the Accused. The first statement was recorded by SSgt Lester Wong on 27 August 2018 whilst two further statements were recorded on 1 October 2018, by Insp Ridlwan and subsequently by ASP Goh Pi Ying. The cautioned statement was also recorded on 1 October 2018, by ASP Goh Pei Ying[^17].

9       The statements themselves were not admitted into evidence through PW1; his testimony was merely to show the number of statements the Accused had given and the dates in which they were given. PW1 further testified that after he took over the investigations, one white pill and one packet of white powdery substance[^18] was handed to him by the previous Investigating Officer, together with the investigation papers. He was informed by the previous IO that he (the previous IO) had received two white pills from Defence Counsel (Mr Dilip Kumar) on 13 August 2019.

10     PW2 Chin Shi Liy Reenie, an HSA analyst, testified that Exhibit P8 was the exhibit she had received for analysis. The exhibit was found to be two tablets. Upon analysis, one tablet was found to contain less than 100 milligrams of codeine[^19], specifically, it contained only 14 milligrams[^20]. When asked in cross-examination whether codeine would metabolise into morphine in one’s body, PW2 stated that it was not within her area of expertise to answer the question[^21].

## Close of the Prosecution’s Case

11     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied of the following:-

> a)     That the Accused’s urine sample was procured in compliance with the procedures stipulated in The Misuse of Drugs (Urine Specimens and Urine Tests) Regulations;

> b)     That the Accused’s urine sample was divided and dealt with in compliance with Section 31(4) of the MDA;

> c)     Based on the urine tests conducted on each part of the urine sample by different HSA analysts, the Accused’s urine was certified to contain morphine.

#### Presumption under section 22 MDA triggered

12     Section 22 of the MDA states:

> _If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b)._

13     As highlighted by the Prosecution[^22], the operation of the Section 22 MDA presumption was explained by the then Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP \[_2011\] 4 SLR 802, at \[10\]:

> _“The significance of compliance with s 31(4)(b) is that if there are positive results from both of the urine tests carried out pursuant to this subsection, the s 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of s 8(b), consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine samples. This means that both the actus reus and the mens rea of the s 8(b) offence are presumed by s 22…”_

14     The Court in _Ashik_ further stated at \[46\]:

> _“…the Prosecution must further prove that the accused person knew that he was consuming the specified drug in question. Without an admission or a confession of that fact, it would be difficult for the Prosecution to prove it. That was why s 22 was enacted to shift the burden of proving absence of knowledge to the accused person in a drug consumption offence.”_

15     Based on the evidence in the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that the presumption under section 22 of the MDA had been triggered. The burden now shifts to the Accused to prove that he did not knowingly consume the specified drug. Accordingly, I called upon the Accused to enter his defence.

## Accused’s Defence

16     The Accused’s defence was one of medication i.e. that he had consumed medication, in the form of white pills, bought from a seller in Geylang, which may have resulted in morphine being found in his urine. Other than that, he could not think of another reason why morphine was found in his urine[^23]. What the Accused was certain of was that he did not take any drugs[^24]. In essence, the Accused’s position was that he purchased and consumed the white pills without knowing the contents therein, which resulted in morphine being found in his urine. Therefore, the Accused did not knowingly consume the specified drug[^25].

17     The Accused informed the Court that he woke up on 22 August 2018, with aches on his body, especially on his waist area. He called up his workplace to ask for a day off. In the evening, the Accused went to Geylang to look for “_someone who would sell medicine by the roadside to relieve the pain_”[^26]. That evening, he bought six round, white pills from a Chinese man[^27], who sold the pills to him from a floor mat without a licence. The Accused stated that the pills were recommended by the seller and there were labels with Chinese characters on the packets containing the pills. He was not given any instructions regarding the pills; neither did he enquire what was inside the pills. The Accused paid $10 for the six pills[^28]. The Accused confirmed that Exhibit P8 contained the balance of the white pills he had bought from the seller in Geylang.

18     The Accused testified that he consumed two pills on 22 August 2018 and a day or two later (either on 23 or 24 August 2018), another two pills – a total of four white pills. Thereafter, when he did not feel any more discomfort from his back, he stopped consuming the pills. Hence, the Accused had the balance of two pills, which he kept with him[^29]. The Accused confirmed that between 24August 2018 and June or July 2019, he was in possession of the two white pills[^30]; he added that he only handed the white pills to his counsel after he was out of remand[^31]. Accused was unsure of when he handed the pills to his counsel but as presented in the Prosecution’s case, it was unchallenged evidence that the white pills were handed over to the previous IO of the case by Defence Counsel Mr Dilip Kumar, only on 13 August 2019.

19     As put forward by the Prosecution, the two white pills were promptly sent to HSA for analysis. One white pill (or tablet) was found to contain less than 100 milligrams of codeine.

20     No other witnesses were called in the Defence’s case.

## Accused’s failure to rebut the presumption

21     Having considered the Accused’s evidence, I was of the view that the Accused’s claim of having consumed white pills bought from a street vendor in Geylang for his body pain, which subsequently gave rise to morphine being found in his urine, was a complete fabrication and an afterthought.

#### Purchase of medication from a Geylang street vendor – A convenient story

22     To begin with, it was odd that the Accused would purchase medication for his body ache from an unlicensed street vendor who sold medication off a floor mat. The Accused admitted to having visited no less than three different licensed clinics on four consecutive Mondays after his routine urine test on 27 August 2018 (specifically, 3 September 2018, 10 September 2018, 17 September 2018 and 24 September 2018). On each occasion, he obtained medication as well as a 1-day medical certificate. Clearly, the Accused was one who was not unfamiliar or unaccustomed with consulting doctors practising in private clinics or those in Polyclinics[^32] (where he attended on two occasions). Further, the clinics the Accused was shown to have attended at were all in the vicinity of Sengkang because the Accused stated he “_stayed somewhere there_”[^33]. Yet, the Accused stated that he preferred to travel all the way to Geylang, to purchase unknown pills from an unlicensed seller who sold medication off a floor mat, just a week before his urine tested positive for morphine in a routine urine test. It seemed to be a convenient story, incapable of any investigative follow-up by the CNB.

#### Failure of Accused to mention the consumption and/or possession of medication

23     If the Accused’s story was true i.e. that he had indeed purchased and consumed a total of four white pills just five to seven days prior to going for the urine test, then it was inconceivable that the Accused would have failed to mention this fact to SSgt Lester Wong and/or Sgt Haiqal when he found out that his urine tested positive for Opiates (on the first IUT) and for Opiates and Benzodiazepines (on the second IUT) at the material time. In fact, it was the Accused’s own evidence that he did exactly the opposite, i.e. he informed SSgt Lester Wong that he had _not_ consumed any traditional Chinese medicine on or prior to 27 August 2018[^34]. There was no discernible reason why the Accused would do that.

24     The Accused not only inexplicably failed to disclose the consumption of the white pills to SSgt Lester Wong or any CNB officer at the earliest opportunity on 27 August 2018, he also did not mention that he had consumed or was in physical possession of the balance of the white pills in a statement recorded by SSgt Lester Wong on 27 August 2018[^35]. This was despite the fact that the Accused agreed that his purchase of the white pills from the seller in Geylang would have been fresh in his memory[^36] and that he had the white pills with him all along[^37].

25     Right up to 1 October 2018 in the morning when he turned up for another urine test and was placed under arrest, the Accused maintained that he did not consume any medication prior to his routine urine test on 27 August 2018. This was captured in a further statement recorded by Insp Ridlwan. The Accused also did not inform Insp Ridlwan that he was in possession of the “_two leftover white pills_”. That same morning, the Accused also had the opportunity to read the first statement recorded by SSgt Lester Wong but did not make any amendment to it[^38].

#### Accused’s explanation for such failure to mention the consumption and/or possession of the medication was unbelievable

26     The Accused’s explanation for why he failed to mention his consumption of the white pills and the fact that he had these pills with him to any CNB officer on 27 August 2018 or the morning of 1 October 2018, was unbelievable.

27     He testified was that he was ignorant “_from the start that it contains something like this from the tablet….I did not know from the early stage or from the start_”[^39]. He added that he did not think of raising it because he had previously taken “_sex pills_” which had led to false positive IUT results[^40] , which were not supported by HSA analysis. The Accused testified that because he had had this experience of false positive IUT results (with no result from HSA) on occasions where he had taken sex pills, he did not see the need to inform SSgt Lester Wong that he was in possession of the white pills.[^41]

28     I found the Accused’s line of reasoning illogical. If the Accused had the previous experience of attending at a routine urine test where the IUT showed up a positive result which he knew was due to the consumption of sex pills (and not because he had consumed drugs), it would be reasonable to expect the Accused to be more alert to the results of his IUT and what may have given rise to a positive (but false) result; not more indifferent. As the Prosecution put it, the Accused would have been more sensitive to the fact that his consumption of the white pills five days prior to the random urine testing may have led to his urine sample testing positive for Opiates on both occasions on 27 August 2018[^42].

29     However, when the IUT results turned up positive, there is no evidence before me that the Accused even casually mentioned to SSgt Lester Wong (or even Sgt Haiqal) that he had consumed such white pills prior to the routine urine test (which could possibly explain the positive result), much less mentioned that he still had the balance two white pills. The Accused did not breathe a word about it to any CNB officer, whether on 27 August 2018 or even the morning of 1 October 2018 when he was placed under arrest. In fact, he did the contrary i.e. he informed SSgt Lester Wong and Insp Ridlwan that he had _not_ consumed any medication prior to 27 August 2018. The Accused’s conduct was inexplicable.

30     In my view, the Accused’s explanation for failing to mention his consumption and/or possession of the white pills at the material time or within reasonable time was not believable.

#### Late production of the medication by Accused

31     The eventual production of the balance two white pills by the Accused was sorely belated. The Accused agreed he had the two white pills with him all the time, from 24 August 2018[^43]. However, it was only around June or July 2019 that these two white pills surfaced – this was when the Accused handed the white pills over to his lawyer[^44].

32     As Prosecution submitted, the Accused had ample opportunity to provide the leftover white pills to any CNB officer after the routine urine test on 27 August 2018, if such white pills did exist and were in the possession of the Accused. The Accused was only placed under arrest on 1 October 2018 when he attended at CNB. If he missed the chance to submit these pills on 1 October 2018, he could still have done so after he was released on bail on 16 March 2019. However, the white pills only surfaced in June or July 2019. There was no satisfactory explanation from the Accused why he took so long to produce the pills if in fact, he had them with him all along.

#### Material Inconsistencies between Accused’s testimony and second further statement recorded in the evening of 1 October 2018

33     As mentioned, right up to 1 October 2018 in the morning when his statement was recorded by Insp Ridlwan, the Accused maintained that he did not consume any medication prior to his routine urine test on 27 August 2018 nor was he in possession of the “_two leftover white pills_”.

34     Strangely, when a second further statement was recorded from the Accused by ASP Goh Pei Ying on the same day in the evening (Exhibit P10), the Accused revealed his consumption of “_two brown capsules_”. In this further statement, the Accused narrated how he bought four packets containing two brown capsules from a Chinese male who was “_openly selling illegal medicine on a floor mat_”[^45]. Importantly, the Accused stated that he did not have any of the “_brown capsules_” left with him or at home[^46].

35     Exhibit P10 was tendered by the Prosecution in the course of the Accused’s cross-examination. When presented, it was clear that there were material inconsistencies between the Accused’s testimony in Court and what he had told ASP Goh in the statement recorded on 1 October 2018:-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.78%"> <col width="50.22%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Testimony in Court</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Details in Statement (Exh P10)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Purchased six pills for $10</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Purchased eight capsules for a total of $10</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The six pills were white in colour</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The eight capsules were brown in colour</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumed two pills on 22 August and 23/24<sup>th</sup> August 2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumed two capsules on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday i.e. 21, 22, 24 25 August</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Leftover two white pills</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">No leftover brown capsules</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

36     I was not concerned whether the medication the Accused claimed to have consumed were described as “_pills_”, “_capsules_” or “_tablets_” – terms which appeared to have been used interchangeably in the course of the trial. Rather, I was troubled by the inconsistencies highlighted above which formed the crux of the Accused’s medication defence.

37     The Accused was given a chance to explain the material inconsistencies. His explanations were far from satisfactory as he brushed them aside with “_This is a bit too long ago, so I can’t remember_”; “_I can’t recall how many I bought, what I ate, the colour_”[^47], which soon became a constant and convenient refrain. When referred to Exhibit P8 – the white pills which had been examined by HSA as being different from the brown capsules, the refrain was “_Based on what I can remember, this is what I consumed_”[^48]. When questioned regarding the difference in the frequency at which he consumed the medication, the Accused simple responded: “_I can’t remember this_”[^49]. As to why he had said in the statement that he had no brown capsules left yet produced to his lawyer 2 white pills, the Accused retorted: “_Like I said, there are some that I can’t remember, it’s been a while. So how can I explain? I do not know how to explain_”[^50].

38     The Accused’s explanations for the material inconsistencies were poor and unconvincing. I did not find the inconsistencies between his testimony in court and the statement recorded on 1 October 2018 to have anything to do with a lack of a good memory. The alleged purchase and consumption of the pills from a street vendor in Geylang took place less than one and a half months before he gave the statement to ASP Goh Pei Ying on 1 October 2018. It was not likely that the Accused could have mis-informed ASP Goh as to the number and colour of the capsules he had purchased or the frequency he had consumed them, if the Accused’s story is to be believed.

39     Even if the Accused could have genuinely forgotten the number of pills/capsules he had purchased and how many times he had taken the medication, it was incredible that the Accused could have forgotten something as basic as the colour of the medication he bought. More importantly, the Accused informed ASP Goh that he had no brown capsules left, only to produce two white pills months later.

40     I find that what the Accused did not remember was what he had said in the statement to ASP Goh Pei Ying on 1 October 2018, which has now led to him producing two white pills (instead of brown capsules) and a testimony in court at grave variance with his statement. I did not find the Accused to be a credible witness at all and I rejected his evidence.

#### Conclusion

41     In light of the foregoing and having considered the totality of the Accused’s evidence, I find his defence of medication to be a complete fabrication and an afterthought. It was something that the Accused thought up only after he was placed under arrest on 1 October 2018 and after his further statement had been recorded by Insp Ridlwan in the morning. That explained why the consumption and existence of the white pills (or brown capsules) were never mentioned by the Accused at first instance or at the earliest opportunity. That also explained why the Accused failed to produce the medication until June or July 2019 when he had more than sufficient opportunities to do so, if he truly had the medication with him all along as he claimed.

42     It was clear that the Accused’s defence developed with time. First, there was no information forthcoming from the Accused about any consumption or possession of medication that he had taken prior to urine testing; then it became one whereby the Accused consuming eight brown capsules with no balance remaining, and eventually to him purchasing six white pills with two pills handed over to Defence Counsel in June/July 2019. The Accused’s defence was not in the least credible.

43     Apart from the nature of the Accused’s defence, the lack of scientific evidence as to how codeine may metabolise into morphine in one’s body and the amount of codeine necessary for such metabolism, would have seriously hampered the Accused’s defence in any case.

44     I find that the Accused had failed to rebut the presumption under section 22 of the MDA on a balance of probabilities. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven their case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted him on the charge accordingly.
