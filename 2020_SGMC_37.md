Civil Procedure – Striking out

Evidence – Admissibility of evidence – Without prejudice

3 July 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       A gymnasium (“gym”) member continued to pay for his monthly gym membership for about 14 years without visiting the gym during the same period because he thought that he had cancelled the said membership. After discovering this error, he corresponded with the gym via several telephone communications. He alleges that during these conversations, the gym had admitted to mistakenly making monthly deductions and that it was therefore willing to compensate him. The gym denies these admissions. The question before me is whether these communications he had with the gym (assuming they are true and accurate) are protected by privilege.

## Salient facts and parties’ cases

2       Mr Lee Yeow Peng (“the Plaintiff”) was a patron of Fitness First Singapore Pte Ltd (“the Defendant”).

3       The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant can be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The Plaintiff had signed up as a member of the Defendant’s fitness studios sometime around August 2004.

> (b)     The Plaintiff subsequently terminated his membership with the Defendant sometime around mid-2005. He thereafter did not utilise his membership and did not visit as a member at any of the Defendant’s fitness centres.

> (c)     Despite the termination, his bank account was continually billed every month for more than 14 years. The Plaintiff was unaware of these monthly deductions until August 2019 when he had subscribed for mobile banking.

> (d)     The Plaintiff then visited one of the Defendant’s physical branches to highlight that his membership was not properly terminated.

> (e)     The Defendant’s representatives subsequently corresponded with the Plaintiff via telephone conversations. During these calls, the Defendant had admitted that these monthly deductions were inaccurate and had expressed a willingness to compensate him. The Defendant then took immediate steps to prevent any further deductions from September 2019.

> (f)     The parties then entered into negotiations. However, as the Plaintiff finds the terms of the compensation offered by the Defendant to be unacceptable, he has refused the offer and has chosen instead to mount the present legal proceedings against the Defendant in unjust enrichment.

4       The Defendant’s case is simply to dispute the purported cancellation of the membership by the Plaintiff. In relation to the telephone conversations, while the Defendant does not deny their existence, the Defendant’s case is that their representatives made no admission and/or any promises to offer compensation during the telephone communications.

## The Defendant’s application

5       The present application before me is filed by the Defendant. The Defendant has applied to strike out parts of the statement of claim (“SOC”) filed on 30 October 2019 and for an extension of time to file its defence. In my judgment, the more pertinent issue for determination is whether the striking out application should be granted. This is because there is nothing in principle to preclude the application for an extension of time and the only issue in that application is one of costs. Further, the incidence of costs for the application for extension of time may also be influenced by my decision on the first issue of striking out. I therefore deal primarily with the first issue in my decision below.

6       There are two allegedly offending portions of the SOC which the Defendant seeks to strike out, and these are (“the Disputed Portions”):

> (a)     paragraph 7 of the SOC and all paragraphs that refer to that paragraph; and

> (b)     the last clause of paragraph 13 of the SOC.

7       To provide the necessary context, I reproduce below in full the two paragraphs of the Disputed Portions referred to above:

> 7.    Sometime in August 2019, there were several telephone conversations during which, _inter alia_, the plaintiff informed the Defendant's representative that there were monthly deductions made from the UOB Account, despite the cancellation of his membership in early or mid-2005. During these conversations, the Defendant's representative informed and/or admitted to the Plaintiff that:

>> (a)    The monthly deductions from the Plaintiff's UOB Account by the Defendant was \[_sic_\] not correct;

>> (b)    The Defendant will take immediate steps to cease the monthly deductions from the Plaintiff's UOB Account;

>> (c)    The Defendant was willing to provide some form of compensation to the Plaintiff such as free membership.

> 13.    The Defendant had deducted from the UOB Account membership fees for the Defendant's fitness studios fully aware that the Plaintiff had cancelled his membership sometime in early or mid-2005, which the Defendant accepted.

8       The Defendant argues that the Disputed Portions ought to be struck out because they refer to “without prejudice” conversations; they are therefore privileged and hence inadmissible.

9       The Plaintiff argues that the communications are not privileged because they took place before the parties had entered into settlement negotiations and the communications took place in the context of a fact gathering exercise.

## My decision

10     Having carefully considered the parties’ oral and written arguments, I am of the view that paragraphs 7(a) and 7(c) of the SOC should be struck out because they reference “without prejudice” communications and are therefore inadmissible.

11     I start first with the relevant principles of the law.

### Relevant legal principles on “without prejudice” communications

12     It is trite that the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“the EA”) only allows relevant evidence to be considered by the court. In this regard, s 23(1) of the EA provides that an admission is _not_ relevant where either of the two conditions stipulated in the section is satisfied. Section 23(1) reads as follows:

> **Admissions in civil cases when relevant**

> **23.—(1**)    In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it is made —

>> (_a_)    upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given; or

>> (_b_)    upon circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given.

13     It is clear from the express language in s 23(1) of the EA that a “without prejudice” communication does not have to be expressly marked or prefaced as such in order to gain protection (see s 23(1)(_b_) of the EA). This much is also clear from the observation of the Court of Appeal in _Mariwu Industrial Co (S) Pte Ltd v Dextra Asia Co Ltd and another_ \[2016\] 4 SLR(R) 807 (“_Mariwu_”) at \[24\]:

> …

> The words in s 23 \[EA\] contemplate two different situations that invoke the underlying rationales of the ‘without prejudice’ rule. The first situation is where there is an express condition that any admission made by either party in the context of negotiations to settle a dispute is not to be ‘given’, _ie_, admissible in evidence against the party making the admission. The situation applies to all communications made expressly ‘without prejudice’. The second situation is where an admission is made ‘under circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not be given’. This situation will cover cases where _even though a statement is not expressly made ‘without prejudice’ the law holds that it is made without prejudice because it was made in the course of negotiations to settle a dispute_: see the judgment of Lord Hoffmann in _Bradford & Bingley plc v Rashid_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 WLR 2066</span> at \[13\]… \[emphasis added\]

14     To similar effect, the House of Lords has remarked that the determination of the “without prejudice” privilege is not an exercise in literary construction. As stated by Lord Griffiths in _Rush & Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council and another_ <span class="citation">\[1989\] AC 1280</span> (“_Rush & Tompkins_”) (at 1299– 1300):

> ... \[T\]he application of the rule is not dependent upon the use of the phrase 'without prejudice' and if it is clear from the surrounding circumstances that the parties were seeking to compromise the action, evidence of the content of those negotiations will, as a general rule, not be admissible at the trial and cannot be used to establish an admission or partial admission. … I believe that the question has to be looked at more broadly and resolved by balancing two different public interests namely the public interest in promoting settlements and the public interest in full discovery between the parties to the litigation.

15     These observations are of especial application to the present case. The communications in question before me took place over the _telephone_ between the Plaintiff and representatives from the Defendant and there are no audio recording or transcripts of the said conversations. In the circumstances, it is extremely unlikely for the Defendant’s representative to have expressly stated that their communications were to be treated as “without prejudice”. Instead, the more plausible limb for protection here is s 23(1)(_b_) of the EA.

16     It is also established law that the assessment of whether the communications between the parties took place in the course of negotiations to settle a dispute is to be ascertained objectively “in the context of the factual circumstances” (see _Cytec Industries Pte Ltd v APP Chemicals International (Mau) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 769</span> at \[16\]).

17     In this regard, case law has held that the privilege is not limited to the offer of settlement itself but extends also to communications “that invites compromise, or outlines approaches that might be taken to _settlement_, or refers in some indirect way to settlement” (see _Swee Wan Enterprises Pte Ltd v Yak Thye Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 313</span> (“_Swee Wan_”) at \[32\]). The rationale for this can be found in the decision of Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) in _Sin Lian Heng Construction Pte Ltd v Singapore Telecommunications Ltd_ (“_Sin Lian Heng_”) <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 433</span> at \[32\]):

> … Negotiations must begin somewhere, and if the public policy is to encourage parties to a dispute to reach a compromise or a settlement, then it must be the case that _the initiating communication is itself protected from disclosure in the event that settlement is not reached_. To hold otherwise would have _a chilling effect on those contemplating the initiation of negotiations_, and that is flatly contrary to the policy I have referred to. In my view, the first shot principle is not a distinct principle from the ‘without prejudice’ privilege. Rather, it is a particular but quite natural application of the latter, and is based on the same public policy considerations. …. \[emphasis added\]

18     This analysis based on the “first shot” principle was recently adopted by Hoo Sheau Peng J in _Swee Wan_ (at \[32\]):

> … \[T\]he ‘without prejudice’ privilege should also protect correspondence that is issued as the ‘first shot’ in a course of negotiations that leads to settlement. This is a pragmatic recognition of the fact that ‘\[n\]egotiations must begin somewhere’ (_Sin Lian Heng_ at \[32\]). At the beginning, parties may tread carefully and not immediately invoke the concept of ‘settlement’. The crucial inquiry, then, is whether the correspondence is part of a larger series of correspondence which will reasonably lead to settlement of the dispute. …

### Whether the telephone communications are privileged

19     Based on the legal authorities expounded above, the germane issue for my determination is whether the telephone communications referred to by the Plaintiff at paragraph 7 of the SOC (see \[7\] above) falls within the “first shot” principle.

20     While I had initially directed parties to consider whether a more specific rule applies in the customer service setting, the parties’ written submissions revealed that there are no specific jurisprudence on that issue – I have therefore confined my judgment to only the factual scenario before me.

21     In my judgment, the telephone communications are protected by “without prejudice” privilege insofar as paragraphs 7(a) and 7(c) of the Disputed Portions are concerned. My main reason for this finding is as follows. Based on the Plaintiff’s pleaded case in these two sub-paragraphs, the Defendant had allegedly admitted to wrongfully making deductions and had also expressed a willingness to compensate the Plaintiff. This clearly comes within the “first shot” principle elucidated above, _ie_, based on the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, the Defendant had fired the “first shot” to settle the parties’ differences by indicating that it was willing to compensate the Plaintiff for the erroneous deductions.

22     With that overview, I turn now to apply the specific legal test. The court typically considers whether the following two conjunctive requirements are met when assessing whether the “without prejudice” privilege can be successfully invoked (see _Mariwu_ at \[29\]; see also _Sin Lian Heng_ at \[13\]):

> (a)     whether the communications (in respect of which the privilege is claimed) arose in the course of negotiations to settle a dispute); and

> (b)     whether the communications constitute or involve an admission against the maker’s interest.

23     Considering the first requirement, I am satisfied that this is met because according to the Plaintiff, the Defendant was “willing to provide some form of compensation to the Plaintiff such as free membership” (see paragraph 7(c) of the SOC, reproduced at \[7\] above). This was indeed the “first shot” in the course of the parties’ negotiations – the Defendant had suggested a willingness to negotiate and compromise (see \[17\] above and _Swee Wan_ at \[32\]). Indeed, following these telephone conversations, it is common ground between the parties that they proceeded to negotiate on the specific terms and mode of the settlement. Just because the settlement terms were not as concrete at that time does not change the fact that it was the initial telephone communications that had kick-started the negotiations between parties.

24     At this point, it is apposite to the return to the observation I made at \[15\] above – the present dispute arises in the context of telephone conversations for which there are no transcripts. To that extent, this case is different from the archetypal examples of documents, emails, minutes of meetings and letters in which categories of evidence the “without prejudice” privilege typically arises. I note also that the “first shot” principle was laid down in the High Court decisions of _Sin Lian Heng_ and _Swee Wan_ in the usual context.

25     Nevertheless, based on my reading of the principle laid down in both these High Court decisions, I do not see any reason why the principle should not also be extended to cover all forms of communications, including telephone conversations. In my judgment, it is not the _mode_ of communications that is material but rather the **_context_** in which the communications took place. If the communications had taken place in the context of resolving a dispute, it ought to be protected, even where there is no written record of what was discussed. This view is in line with the oft-cited public policy justification for the “without prejudice” rule. The “without prejudice” rule renders inadmissible _all_ negotiations aimed at settlement whether “oral or in writing” in order to encourage litigants to “settle their differences rather than litigate them to a finish” (_Rush & Tompkins_ at 1299 _per_ Lord Griffiths). In other words, it is imperative for the privilege to exist so that parties are not “discouraged by the knowledge that anything that is said in the course of such negotiations ... may be used to their prejudice” (_per_ Oliver LJ in _Cutts v Head_ \[1984\] Ch 290 at 306, quoted with approval by the House of Lords in _Rush & Tompkins_ at 1299). The same rationale applies in the context of the “first shot” principle, which as has been noted by Menon JC, is not a “distinct principle from the ‘without prejudice’ privilege” but rather a “natural application of the \[rule\] … based on the same public policy considerations” (_Sin Lian Heng_ at \[32\]).

26     Turning now to the second element of the inquiry, the court considers whether the communications constitute or involve an admission against the maker’s interest. If indeed what the Plaintiff alleges is true as to what had transpired during the telephone communications, it is also obvious to me that this requirement is satisfied as the Defendant had allegedly admitted that the monthly deductions made from the Plaintiff’s bank account were “not correct” (see paragraph 7(a) of the SOC, reproduced at \[7\] above). For completeness, I note that this does not amount to an unequivocal admission of liability (which is an exception to the “without prejudice” rule – see _Swee Wan_ at \[12\]) because there was still a live dispute between the parties on quantum (see _Sin Lian Heng_ at \[48\]) as pleaded at paragraph 7(c) of the SOC and as evident from the parties’ subsequent negotiations.

27     I deal now with the Plaintiff’s argument that the Disputed Portions should not be struck out because the Defendant denies that any admissions were made by it. Here, the Plaintiff highlights the affidavit evidence by the Defendant, which reproduces their internal records disclosing that the telephone communications took place in the context of a “fact-gathering” exercise. I respectfully disagree with the Plaintiff’s argument.

28     In my judgment, this argument misses the real inquiry before the court, which is whether the Disputed Portions in the SOC filed by the _Plaintiff_ ought to be stuck out. In that regard, it is the Plaintiff’s own _pleaded_ case that there was an admission of wrongful deductions by the Defendant and that the Defendant had informed that it was willing to provide some form of compensation to the Plaintiff. The Defendant’s stance is therefore not relevant to the issue of whether the Plaintiff’s pleadings in the SOC can survive the “without prejudice” rule.

29     Taking a step back, one can test the logic of the Plaintiff’s argument as follows. Assuming that I disallow the application and the matter proceeds to trial where the parties’ respective witnesses testify, there are only two possibilities moving forward. The first option is where the trial judge finds that the Plaintiff’s version is correct (_ie_, the Defendant had admitted to making wrongful deductions and had expressed a willingness to provide some form of compensation to the Plaintiff) – the evidence would then be inadmissible on account of privilege under s 23(1)(_b_) of the EA for the reasons I have stated above. The second option is that the trial judge finds that the Defendant’s version is correct (_ie_, there were no promises made because the telephone conversations were only meant to gather facts), in which case the Plaintiff would not even be able to rely on the alleged admissions of the Defendant in the first place. From the above two mutually exclusive possibilities, it becomes clear that paragraphs 7(a) and (c) ought to be struck out. There is no reason to have these sub-paragraphs in paragraph 7 intact – their only purpose would be to distract the trial court from the germane issue of whether the Plaintiff’s membership with the Defendant had been properly terminated.

30     It accordingly follows that paragraphs 7(a) and (c) of the SOC are to be struck out as they are protected by the “without prejudice” privilege.

### Matters not covered by the privilege

31     However, as alluded to above, I decline to strike out paragraph 7 of the SOC in entirety. I do not find that paragraph 7(b) of the SOC is protected by the same privilege as it is simply an undisputed factual statement, which does not amount to an admission within the meaning of s 23 of the EA.

32     In the circumstances, I direct the Plaintiff to make consequential amendments to paragraph 7 to remove all other references to the “without prejudice” communications, which I have found above to be inadmissible.

33     Lastly, for paragraph 13, I do not find that the last clause needs to be struck out in entirety because there is no reference to any communications between the parties, let alone any “without prejudice” communications. Nevertheless, in the interests of clarity, the Plaintiff is to amend the last clause of paragraph 13 to ensure that the “acceptance” referred to therein is in respect of the alleged cancellation of the gym membership back in 2005 by the Plaintiff and not in any way, express or implied, to any alleged admission made during the telephone communications between the parties in August 2019.

## Conclusion

34     For the foregoing reasons, I allow in part the Defendant’s application for striking out, direct the Plaintiff to make consequential amendments within 7 days of the date of this judgment and grant the Defendant an extension of time to file its defence within 14 days of service of the amended SOC.

35     Before I hear parties on costs, I would like to place on record my appreciation to counsel for both the Plaintiff and the Defendant for their well-reasoned written submissions and compelling oral advocacy.
