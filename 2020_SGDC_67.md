Negligence – Personal Injuries

23 March 2020

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

## Introduction

1       When a pedestrian leaves the relatively safer area of a pedestrian walkway and ventures onto the road, that pedestrian must be aware of and appreciate the risks undertaken.

2       On the morning of 21 November 2016, the Plaintiff, Tan Zhen Cheng (“Tan”), was on her way to work. Her workplace was at Jalan Lembah Kallang (the “Road”). As was her usual practice at that time, she entered the pedestrian walkway on the side of the Road, on foot. On the material date, she was not able to use the pedestrian walkway at a certain point, on the left side (from her perspective) of the Road, as she said that it was blocked by several vehicles.

3       Tan thus stepped onto the Road. At this time, the Defendant, Ayyasamy Arulraj (the “Driver”) was in a truck YL 9407S (the “Truck”) which was under the control of a company known as K & C Design Construction Com Pte Ltd (the “Company”). The Driver, a foreign national, was then employed by the Company.

4       Whilst Tan was walking on the Road, the Driver reversed the Truck and collided into Tan. Tan suffered personal injuries. Tan brought this action against the Driver in July 2018. By this time, the Driver was no longer employed by the Company. His work permit in respect of his employment with the Company had been cancelled in August 2017. According to DW1 (Loo Kah Mun, \[“Loo”\] the sole witness for the Defendant), the Driver is presently not in Singapore. Although the Defendant (the Driver) did not affirm an Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”) and was not present at trial to give evidence, he was represented by solicitors.

5       This was a trial on the issue of liability only. After hearing all the evidence (the witnesses were Tan, her husband, and Loo), and considering the closing submissions from Counsel for Tan and Counsel for the Driver, I found that the Driver had been negligent in his driving of the Truck and was liable to Tan for damages suffered by her. I also found that Tan had been contributorily negligent to the extent that the damages to be awarded to her should be reduced by 50%. I thus found that Tan was entitled to Interlocutory Judgment against the Driver, for 50% of damages to be assessed. Costs and Interest were reserved to the Registrar hearing the Assessment of Damages. Tan appealed.

## The Road

6       The Road, as can be seen from the photographic evidence tendered by both sides, was a one-way road with 2 lanes. There were pedestrian walkways on both sides of the Road. There were some demarcated parking lots along the left side of the Road. Other than these parking lots (at the material parts of the Road), parking along the road was prohibited by parallel double yellow lines along both the left and right sides of the Road. At certain parts of the Road (both on the left and right hand sides of the Road), it was physically possible for vehicles to be positioned perpendicular to the Road. An example of this can be seen in PBD36.

## The material portions of Tan’s pleaded case

7       In her Statement of Claim (which was amended on the date of the trial), Tan pleaded that on the material date, she had been walking on the pedestrian walkway of the Road on her way to work. The Truck was parked in front of 1 Jalan Lembah Kallang, the address of the Company. There were “several parked vehicles which completely blocked (Tan’s) path on the pedestrian walkway”.

8       As Tan’s path was blocked “by the said vehicles”, Tan was “left with little or no choice but to walk around the (Truck) and proceed ahead”. Then, “(all) of a sudden, the Defendant reversed (the Truck) without warning and/or alert and hit (Tan)”.

## The material portions of the Defendant’s pleaded Defence

9       The Driver was reversing the Truck into the Company’s premises. He had engaged the reverse gear and there was a beeping sound from the Truck. He then “waited for about 5 seconds and checked both the side mirrors before he started to reverse (the Truck)”. Whilst reversing, he “suddenly heard someone shouting to stop (the Truck)”, upon which he stopped, alighted from the Truck and discovered Tan. Tan “also had her earphones on at the material time”.

10     The Driver denied that he reversed the Truck “without warning”, and said that Tan had “entered the path of the reversing (Truck), despite the beeping sound … and despite seeing the reverse lights on the rear of the (Truck)”.

11     The Driver denied that the pedestrian walkway was blocked, and averred that Tan “ought to have used the pedestrian walkway or pathway to walk instead of walking along the road”.

## Tan’s evidence in her AEIC

12     In her AEIC, Tan said that at the material time, she was walking on the pedestrian walkway of the Road, which was a route she used “every day to get to work”. As she was on the pedestrian walkway, she noticed the Truck which was stationary on the Road.

13     Tan said that the stationary Truck, “together with other vehicles parked along (the Road) in a perpendicular manner, resulted in my path on the pedestrian walkway being completely obstructed”.

14     Tan then said that she was “left with no choice but to circle around the (Truck) to get to my destination. I stepped out onto the road from the pedestrian (walkway) and just as I was about a metre away from the right rear part of the (Truck), the Defendant suddenly reversed with no warning at all and collided into me”.

15     Tan said that she “did not hear any beeping sounds from the (Truck)” and also “did not see any reverse lights”. Tan further said that while she could not remember if she had any earpieces on, she had it on in one ear or not at all. She was “definitely not listening to any music” at that time, and was “fully aware of my surroundings”.

16     Tan’s Police Report (made on the same date as the accident) is exhibited to her AEIC. In her Police Report, Tan mentions that the Truck was “blocking (her) path”. Tan did not mention other vehicles parked perpendicularly. As the Truck had blocked her path, Tan stated that she did not “have any choice but to detour and walked on the road”.

17     Tan further stated in her Police Report that she “would also like to state that there will usually be a lot of heavy vehicles moving in and out of (number) 1 Jalan Lembah Kallang every morning”.

## Tan’s husband’s evidence in his AEIC

18     Tan’s husband, Lim Ying Cai (“Lim”), did not give any material contemporaneous evidence in his AEIC. He had taken photographs of the scene, but these were taken on 23 August 2018.

## Loo’s evidence in his AEIC

19     At the material time, Loo was employed by the Company and was the Driver’s supervisor. Loo stated that he was “present near the scene of the accident at the material time”. He was standing near the gate of the Company’s premises.

20     Loo said he heard a beeping sound from the reversing Truck. Shortly after, he heard a scream. When he saw Tan, she had “earphones” in her ears and she was holding a handphone.

21     Loo’s AEIC exhibits the Police Report and the Singapore Accident Statement (commonly referred to as the “GIA Report”) lodged by the Driver.

## Tan’s evidence at trial

22     Tan clarified that when she had stated that the Truck had blocked her path, she meant that this included blocking her path on the Road.

23     Tan maintained her position that there had been vehicles parked in a perpendicular fashion and that this had caused the pedestrian walkway to be blocked. She further maintained that she had not been distracted by her handphone and was not listening to music with her earpieces.

24     What was ultimately crucial for the finding of the respective liability of the parties in this matter was this question: why had Tan not simply crossed over to use the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road?

25     This was a point that Defendant’s Counsel took up in cross examination. It would be noted at this point, that nowhere in her Police Report, Statement of Claim nor her AEIC, did Tan specifically state that both pedestrian walkways (on the left and right hand sides of the Road) had been blocked, thus “forcing” her to walk on the Road.

26     Indeed, in a sketch Tan rendered whilst on the witness stand (admitted and marked as P1), Tan had indicated the path she had taken that day. She had been walking on the left hand side pedestrian walkway. Having ascertained that her further progress on this walkway was impeded by the perpendicularly parked vehicles (as rendered on P1), she stepped out onto the Road at the point she marked with an “X”. She had a view of the Truck when she stepped onto the Road.

27     It is pertinent to note that Tan, in sketching P1, did not indicate any vehicles on the right hand side of the Road, let alone any such vehicles blocking the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road. On its own, this is not necessarily detrimental to Tan’s case. She had been concentrating on rendering the way the left side of the Road had looked that morning, and was demonstrating the respective positions of the Truck and the perpendicularly parked vehicles which she said had blocked her path on the left hand side of the Road.

28     When Defendant’s Counsel directed Tan’s mind to the right hand side of the Road, she confirmed that there had been no construction work being carried out on the right hand side of the Road. On the point whether there had been any “obstruction” on the right hand side of the Road, Tan said, “There is obstruction, there is car parked on the right side.”

29     This point was taken up again later in the cross examination. Defendant’s Counsel said that Tan could have “easily crossed one lane to the right side pavement” (referring to the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road). Tan then replied that there was obstruction on this side of the Road as well. Defendant’s Counsel then started to point out that Tan had not stated this earlier in her AEIC. Tan said, “I never … said it because this, uh, this route is my daily routine route to my workplace.”

30     When Defendant’s Counsel again challenged Tan on this point and said that Tan had not stated in her AEIC or “anywhere”, that the “right side pavement was also blocked at the time of the accident”, Tan answered, “I’m not working on the other side. I’m emphasising on the place of accident where that is my daily route to my workplace.”

31     When this point was further pressed upon by Defendant’s Counsel, Tan said again that “there’s also obstruction of vehicles on the, uh, walkway on the other side” (meaning the right hand side of the Road).

32     In Re-Examination, Tan again reiterated that she did not use the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road as there “was also obstruction of lorries, uh, on the pedestrian walkway”.

33     Tan further stated that she was walking on the left lane of the 2 lanes of the Road. When her Counsel asked Tan why she had not drawn the obstructions on the right hand side of the Road when rendering P1, Tan said, “… from my point of view, … accident between me and the truck. So, I didn’t really think that opposite side, the … the vehicles is (sic) actually important also in the … in the evidence.”

34     It is pertinent to note that Tan was not then asked by her Counsel to supplement her rendition in P1 with the positions of vehicle(s) which she claimed had also rendered the right hand side pedestrian walkway, obstructed.

## Lim’s evidence at trial

35     Lim’s evidence as to the state of the Road was not contemporaneous. As stated in paragraph 18 above, the photographs of the Road were taken on 23 August 2018. The accident occurred on 21 November 2016.

36     These photographs and the notations on some of them were made by Lim based on what Tan had informed him regarding the circumstances of the accident. Bearing in mind that these photographs were taken some time after the accident and could not therefore be accurate reflections of the situation of the Road at the time of the accident, it was clear that Tan and Lim were trying to demonstrate that there had been obstruction. This can be seen, for example, from the photographs at the following pages of Tan’s AEIC: 23, 24, 31, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 59, 62 (to highlight the more prominent examples).

37     These stated photographs apparently show possible obstruction of the left hand side pedestrian walkway of the Road; obstruction caused by vehicles parked perpendicularly.

38     There are apparently only 2 photographs (found on pages 28 and 29 of Tan’s AEIC), which suggest that there was obstruction to the right hand side pedestrian walkway of the Road caused by “construction” (according to Lim’s notation on the photographs). Indeed, as these photographs were taken on 23 August 2018, they might not be reflective of the state of the Road at the time of the accident on 21 November 2016. In any event, Tan’s evidence at trial was that there was no construction being carried out at the right hand side of the Road.

## Loo’s evidence at trial

39     Under cross examination, Loo candidly admitted that he could not be sure of the direct evidence he had given in his AEIC. Loo had not seen the reversing motion of the Truck, nor the coming on of the reversing lights from the Truck.

40     Loo also admitted that he could not be sure that the reversing sounds he said he heard actually emanated from the Truck. Loo also admitted that he could not be sure of details such as the earpiece and handphone allegedly positioned.

## The findings

41     I found that the Defence could not challenge the version (save for one crucial point, to which we shall return) given by Tan. On a balance of probabilities, I found that Tan had indeed been walking on the pedestrian walkway on the left hand side of the Road. Her place of work was further up the Road, on the left hand side.

42     I further found that, on a balance of probabilities, she had indeed found part of the pedestrian walkway on the left hand side of the Road obstructed. I also found, on a balance of probabilities, that there had not been any reversing lights nor any “beeping sound” to warn of the reverse motion of the Truck. The Driver had not given any direct evidence at trial, whether by way of AEIC or oral evidence. Loo’s evidence was not altogether reliable. On a consideration of the respective weight to be given to the differing versions on these points, I found that the findings on these matters had to be in Tan’s favour.

43     The one crucial point which was pivotal in the final analysis of the finding of the respective liability for the accident, was whether Tan was able to use the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road.

44     On this crucial point, I found against Tan. She had not stated in her Police Report, the Statement of Claim (in either the original form or the amended version \[amended on the date of trial\]) or her AEIC, that the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road was also obstructed.

45     The evidence showed that as was her usual route to her workplace, she would ordinarily traverse the pedestrian walkway on the left hand side of the Road, as her workplace was on that side of the Road. On the material day, when she found her usual route impeded, she then stepped out onto the Road. It was not in her contemplation to use the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road, as her workplace was not on that side of the Road.

46     I found, after a consideration of the evidence, that the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road had not been obstructed at that point in time. Tan’s answers during cross examination appeared to be afterthought. Her answers as to the cause of the alleged obstruction on the right hand side were vague: mentioning a “car” during cross examination, and “lorries” during Re-examination. More importantly, was the missed opportunity to supplement in P1, the positions of these alleged obstructing vehicle(s) on the right hand side. Tan had rendered the left hand side obstructions in P1 with some care.

47     It was crucial to her case, to demonstrate where these obstructing vehicle(s) were, on the right hand side. There would still have to be enquiry as to whether there was any discernible route on the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side, notwithstanding the alleged obstruction. Her explanations as to why she had not earlier set out these obstructions were simply not convincing at all.

48     I thus found that there had been nothing that had prevented Tan from safely walking on the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side, down the Road, past where the Truck had originally been (before the reversing motion).

49     The evidence showed that, instead of taking the much safer route of crossing over to the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side, Tan chose to walk on the Road itself. This was particularly dangerous, as she would be walking with her back to traffic (this was a one way street). Coupled with her knowledge (as revealed in her Police Report) that “there will usually be a lot of heavy vehicles moving in and out of (number) 1 Jalan Lembah Kallang every morning”, this meant that she was undertaking a rather risky course of action. This was compounded by her walking on the left lane of the Road. As she was walking in the vicinity of the right rear side of the Truck, this meant that Tan was almost effectively walking in the middle of the Road. The obviously safer route would be to walk on the pedestrian walkway on the right hand side of the Road, or as far right as she could. Even if she did not walk on the pedestrian walkway itself, she could have taken a much wider arc, avoiding any possibility of coming near the Truck.

50     In the final analysis, the Driver had been negligent in executing the reverse motion as he did, without ascertaining that it was completely safe to do so. Tan’s actions indicated a high degree of contributory negligence on her part. She undertook a dangerous route when a much safer alternative beckoned. In the circumstances, she should not have traversed that part of the Road as she did.

51     Counsel did not present any case authority that was completely on point. In **_Tan Siok Yee (suing by the committee of the person and estate, Liew Chee Kong) and Others v Chong Voon Kee Ivan <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 157</span>_**, the 1st plaintiff was a pedestrian. The defendant had reversed his car toward an available parallel parking lot and collided into the 1st plaintiff in the process. The High Court found both the 1st plaintiff (pedestrian) and the defendant (driver) equally to blame for the accident there.

52     Of the driver, the High Court stated that “a reasonable and prudent driver would not have reversed almost the entire length of the road to get into a parking bay”. Of the pedestrian, the High Court had “no doubt that (she) suddenly stepped out onto the road from the kerb on the left side of the road” and had “failed to look out for traffic in the process”.

53     The High Court further stated that “It serves no purpose to rely on case law to determine liability … as the fact situation in every case is different.”

## Conclusion

54     After a consideration of all the evidence and closing submissions, I found that the Driver had been negligent in reversing the Truck as he did, without ascertaining that it had been completely safe to do so, and for failing to keep a proper lookout. Tan was found to be equally liable for the accident. She had taken a dangerous detour, eschewing a much safer route that had been available to her. She thus placed herself in a position of grave danger.

55     Interlocutory judgment was thus entered in favour of Tan, to receive 50% of damages to be assessed, with costs and interest reserved to the Registrar hearing the Assessment of Damages.
