Employment law – Employee’s duties – Implied duty of fidelity – Whether the mere incorporation of a company during term of employment constitutes breach of employee’s duty of fidelity

Contract – Confidentiality

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 7/2022.\]

4 May 2022

### District Judge Vince Gui:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff, Eri Organization Pte Ltd, brought this action against its former employee, the 1st Defendant for breaching contractual duties of confidence and loyalty as well as infringing its copyright. Its contractual claim was that the 1st Defendant had incorporated the 2nd Defendant, Union International Consultancy Pte Ltd, during her employment and, after the termination of her employment, used confidential information to “unfairly solicit” the Plaintiff’s clients.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) Its copyright claim was that the 2nd Defendant had plagiarised two articles published on the Plaintiff’s website. At the end of the trial, I dismissed the contractual claim primarily because the Plaintiff failed to prove that the 1st Defendant had misappropriated information that was confidential. I however allowed the claim for copyright infringement against the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision on the contractual claim and I now provide the written grounds of my decision.

## Background facts

2       The Plaintiff is a Singapore registered company carrying on the business of providing management consultancy services, corporate secretarial services, nominee directorship services as well as tax and audit services.

3       The 1st Defendant was its former employee. She was first employed as an Administrative Secretary on 9 January 2017. Over the years, she rose through the ranks and was eventually promoted to a Senior Customer Manager in May 2019. Her job scope entailed providing corporate secretarial services and assuming nominee directorship for the Plaintiff’s customers when required. The Plaintiff assigned a number of customers for the 1st Defendant to manage.

4       It was not disputed that the Plaintiff assigned the 1st Defendant a company phone, desktop computer, email account and instant messaging account, through which the 1st Defendant communicated with the Plaintiff’s customers on business matters.

5       About three years into her employment, the 1st Defendant decided to move on from the Plaintiff. She tendered a letter of resignation on 10 February 2020 and parties mutually agreed to abridge her contractual notice period. Her employment ended on 28 February 2020.

6       On the same day of 10 February 2020, the Plaintiff received a report from Ms Choong Soo See (“Ms Choong”), an employee of the IT vendor engaged by the Plaintiff, SE IT Solutions Pte Ltd, stating that she discovered a mass deletion of files on the desktop computer assigned to the 1st Defendant (“Computer”). Mr Michael Chen (“Mr Chen”), the Chief Development Officer of the Plaintiff, contacted the 1st Defendant to express displeasure at the deletion. The 1st Defendant replied saying the deletion was inadvertent. Ms Choong also informed the Plaintiff that she had witnessed an external hard disk connected to the Computer and that company documents were saved onto the external hard disk. It was undisputed that employees were not allowed to connect external hard disks to computers in the Plaintiff’s premises.

7       About a month after the cessation of the 1st Defendant’s employment with the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff began receiving emails from the 1st Defendant notifying the Plaintiff that some of its customers wished to terminate their corporate secretarial and directorship services with the Plaintiff and have engaged the 2nd Defendant to be their service provider. A total of 31 customers left the Plaintiff for the 2nd Defendant, save for Korrun International Pte Ltd which continued to engage the Plaintiff for corporate secretarial, accounting and audit services but engaged the 2nd Defendant for “transfer pricing report service”. The Plaintiff then discovered that the 1st Defendant incorporated the 2nd Defendant on 24 October 2019 and was its sole director and shareholder at the time of its incorporation.

8       On or around 17 June 2020, the Plaintiff engaged a digital forensic expert to examine the deletion activity and to identify potential data transfer activity on the Computer. Mr Shing Tak Zack Lau (“Mr Lau”), the appointed expert, received the Computer on 23 June 2020 and proceeded to image the hard disk for inspection. His findings were detailed in a report dated 26 June 2020 (the “Forensic Report”), which stated that 8,203 folders/files were deleted on 19 November 2019.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) This was the last day on which the 1st Defendant entered the Plaintiff’s office premises. According to the Plaintiff’s attendance records populated by a biometric sensor that scans the fingerprints of employees when they enter and leave the office premises, the 1st Defendant was present at the office premises from 11.36 am to 3.59 pm on 19 November 2019.

9       The Forensic Report also stated that an external hard drive was connected to the Computer and the last connection took place on 19 November 2019. To identify potential file transfer, Mr Lau studied the presence of “LNK files”. As he explained in the Forensic Report, LNK files are automatically created in the Computer when a file is opened on the external hard disk. The LNK file contains useful information such as file path, volume serial number and volume label. He identified 15 LNK files which indicated that there were at least 15 files on the external hard disk. The Forensic Report concluded that this “implies that there has been the \[sic\] transfer of data from the Computer to the identified USB external hard drive”.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

10     The Plaintiff took the view that the 1st Defendant had incorporated the 2nd Defendant to compete with the Plaintiff, in breach of her duty “not to act against the interest of the Plaintiff” under her employment contract.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) It also took the view that the 1st Defendant had misappropriated confidential information to “unfairly solicit” the Plaintiff’s customers.[^5] It also sued the 1st Defendant for damages arising from the deletion of the data on the Computer.

## Discussion

11     The Plaintiff’s contractual claims fell into three broad categories as follows:

> (a)     incorporation of the 2nd Defendant when the 1st Defendant was still an employee of the Plaintiff;

> (b)     alleged transfer of confidential information to solicit the Plaintiff’s customers to join the 2nd Defendant; and

> (c)     alleged deletion of data on the Computer.

12     I will discuss the claims in sequence.

### Incorporation of the 2nd Defendant

13     The Plaintiff’s pleaded case was that the 1st Defendant had acted in breached of the terms of her employment contract by incorporating the 2nd Defendant on 25 October 2019 while she was still an employee of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff alleged that the 2nd Defendant had “directly competing business objectives” and the 1st Defendant intended to “transfer as many of the Plaintiff’s clients (if not all) to … the 2nd Defendant”.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

14     First of all, it is not clear which term of the employment contract was the Plaintiff referring to. Much was made about an Employee Handbook which the Plaintiff alleged the 1st Defendant to have signed, but even if I were to proceed on the basis that the 1st Defendant had duly signed it, the Plaintiff failed to identify any of the express terms that would have imposed a duty on the 1st Defendant not to incorporate another company during her employment or a duty “not to act against the interest of the Plaintiff” as the Plaintiff had pleaded.

15     Perhaps realising that its pleadings were defective, the Plaintiff argued in its written submissions that the 1st Defendant had instead breached a “common law duty of fidelity” or an “implied duty of fidelity”. This was not how the Plaintiff had pleaded its case on the incorporation of the 2nd Defendant. The relevant provision of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 2), paragraph 6, made no mention of the 1st Defendant breaching any implied term or common law duty of fidelity. It is trite that parties are bound by their pleaded case and no application was made to amend their pleadings. However, even assuming for the sake of argument that this had been properly pleaded, the Court of Appeal has conclusively held that the mere incorporation of a competing business does not fall foul of the duty of fidelity (_Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v Lui Andrew Stewart_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 308</span> (“_Smile_ Inc”) at \[80\]). As the court explained, employees are allowed to take “preparatory steps” to compete with the employer. The duty of fidelity does not prevent them from competing with the former employer once they have left the employment, and the freedom to do so carries with it the freedom to prepare for future activities that the employees intend to pursue (at \[65\]). Underpinning this principle is the recognition that the employment relationship is not typically fiduciary. The purpose of an employment relationship is not to place the employee in a position where he is obliged to pursue his employer’s interest at the expense of his own (at \[52\]). In _Smile Inc_, the employee in question had not only incorporated a competing business during his employment but also did a number of other things such as signing a tenancy agreement for the competing business, fitting out the premises, applying for a license to practice dentistry at the competing business, amongst others. The court found that all of these fell cleanly within the ambit of “preparatory steps” which did not amount to actual competition. _A fortiori_, the mere incorporation of a competing business alone in this case could not amount to a breach of the duty of fidelity.

16     In these premises, the 1st Defendant was entitled to exploit her own skill and labour to compete against her former employer, and to that extent undertake preparatory steps while she was still an employee of the Plaintiff. The incorporation of the 2nd Defendant did not amount to actual competitive activity. There was no evidence that the 1st Defendant had conducted business operations in the 2nd Defendant prior to the termination of the 1st Defendant’s employment.

17     Indeed, the Plaintiff accepted in its written submissions that the duty does not prevent employees from taking preparatory steps to compete with the employer. In its bid to contend that the 1st Defendant went beyond taking preparatory steps, the Plaintiff alleged that the 1st Defendant also “provided corporate services to clients of the 2nd Defendant whilst still employed by the Plaintiff”.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) I found this submission to be quite startling. This allegation was neither pleaded nor put to the 1st Defendant. Further, this was a bare assertion that was not substantiated by any credible evidence. The Plaintiff’s witness, Mr Chen, averred in his AEIC that the 1st Defendant had already begun performing services for the 2nd Defendant’s clients before her resignation.[^8] No evidence was adduced to substantiate this allegation. He further alleged that the 1st Defendant was appointed as a director/shareholder of three companies, namely, Run Chang Shipping Pte Ltd, Tapzen Pte Ltd and Morefun Pte Ltd, before 10 February 2020. Once again, no evidence was adduced to substantiate this allegation. On the contrary, the ACRA business profile search of Tapzen Pte Ltd exhibited in his AEIC shows that the 1st Defendant was appointed as the secretary on 20 March 2020.[^9] Mr Chen then alleged that “these companies were registered in December 2019 and January 2020, with their registered company addresses being the registered address of the 2nd Defendant”. In my view, this allegation was neither here nor there. If the Plaintiff was alleging that the 1st Defendant had assisted with the registration of these companies through the 2nd Defendant, this allegation was not borne out by the ACRA business profile searches exhibited in his AEIC. Those searches were dated 5 January 2021, which reflected the business address of those companies as at that date. They said nothing about the business address of those companies as at 10 February 2020, not to mention the person(s) involved in their registration with ACRA. In any event, none of these were even pleaded by the Plaintiff or put to the 1st Defendant, thereby depriving the 1st Defendant an opportunity to respond to these material allegations.

18     Apart from this allegation, the Plaintiff alleged that the 1st Defendant had copied the Plaintiff’s confidential information relating to its clientele list and transferring the Plaintiff’s confidential information to the 2nd Defendant for the purposes of poaching the Plaintiff’s clients. The Plaintiff further alleged that the 1st Defendant deliberately deleted information stored on the Computer to impede the Plaintiff’s ability to service its clients. While the Plaintiff had pleaded these allegations, these were pleaded in support of the Plaintiff’s claim for “breach of duty of care … and contractual obligations”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) There was no mention of the common law duty of fidelity in the relevant provision of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1). Be that as it may, I would discuss these allegations as they are relevant to the two remaining heads of the Plaintiff’s claim.

### Alleged transfer of confidential information belonging to the Plaintiff

19     The Plaintiff alleged that the 1st Defendant had transferred confidential information of the Plaintiff onto the external hard disk and used them to solicit the 31 clients that switched over to the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff primarily relied on the observations made in the Forensic Report, namely, the existence of 15 LNK files, of which 12 had base path names containing a reference to “ENA” which was the 1st Defendant’s English name. The Plaintiff also relied on the testimony of Ms Choong, who had witnessed an external hard disk buried under a stack of documents on her desk connected to the Computer when she was servicing the Computer on 12 November 2019. She claimed that the said external hard disk contained “many files with data pertaining to her work for the Plaintiff”.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

20     The law on breach of confidence claims was extensively canvassed in the recent Court of Appeal decision of _I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 1130</span> (“_I-Admin_”). In _I-Admin_, the Court of Appeal affirmed the three elements of a successful claim for breach of confidence as follows:

> (a)     the information had to possess the quality of confidence;

> (b)     the information had to have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; and

> (c)     there had to have been unauthorised use of the information to the detriment of the party from whom the information originated.

21     In terms of the analytical framework, the court held that the claimant had the burden of proving the first two requirements. Upon proving these requirements, an action for breach of confidence would be presumed. This presumption would be displaced on proof by the defendant that its conscience was not affected in the circumstances in which the claimant’s wrongful loss interest had been harmed or undermined (at \[61\]-\[62\]).

22     In the present case, I was prepared to accept that the 1st Defendant may have indeed inserted an external hard disk into the Computer during her employment. The Forensic Report identified an external hard disk that was last connected to the Computer. The user of that external hard disk had opened at least 12 files on the external hard disk which generated “LNK files” on the Computer showing the base paths of those files. According to Mr Lau, LNK files are automatically created on the Windows user profile when the file is opened. The Plaintiff alleged that the external hard disk belonged to the 1st Defendant because the base path shows that it was named “ENA”. While anyone could have named an external hard disk as “ENA” and connected it to the Computer, the report went on to state that the said external hard disk was last connected to the Computer on 19 November 2019 at 10.50 am. This happened to be the date on which the 1st Defendant attended the office premises. Two of the Plaintiff’s employees, Mr Tay Sean Yew and Ms Zhang Shu Hui, testified that they had witnessed the Plaintiff accessing the Computer on that day and that they did not witness any other employees using the Computer. This is further corroborated by the Plaintiff’s attendance records populated by a biometric sensor that scans the fingerprints of employees when they enter and leave the office premises, which shows the 1st Defendant present at the office premises from 11.36 am to 3.59 pm on 19 November 2019. While the “last insertion” timestamp in the Forensic Report of 10.50 am preceded the official time at which the 1st Defendant entered office, this could be made possible if the 1st Defendant had tailgated another employee on her initial entry. As counsel for the 1st Defendant did not pursue this point in cross-examination or in written submissions, I made no finding on the discrepancy in the timestamp. Further, Ms Choong witnessed an external hard disk connected to the Computer when she was servicing the Computer during the Plaintiff’s employment and had questioned the 1st Defendant about this. On the totality of the evidence, I was prepared to accept that an external hard disk was connected to the Computer during the 1st Defendant’s employment and that external hard disk belonged to the 1st Defendant on a balance of probabilities.

23     That, however, is not the end of the matter. Just because the 1st Defendant connected an external hard disk to the Computer does not necessarily mean that she had misappropriated confidential information. It remained for the Plaintiff to prove that the 1st Defendant had _acquired_ information belonging to the Plaintiff that was _confidential_. The Plaintiff unfortunately failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that the information on the external hard disk (1) belonged to the Plaintiff and (2) that they had the quality of confidentiality. The LNK files themselves do not shed light on the _contents_ of those 12 files that were opened on the external hard disk. The forensic expert, Mr Lau, categorically stated that he was unable to confirm whether there was indeed a transfer of files from the Computer to the external hard disk.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) Those files could have been present on the external hard disk to begin with. The Plaintiff could have overcome these difficulties by adducing the underlying contents of those files which could potentially show that the information not only belonged to the Plaintiff but were also confidential. However, it did none of that. All that was in evidence were the base path of those files, which were in Chinese characters. English translations of those file names were not adduced. The Plaintiff alleged that the base paths of those files contained the Plaintiff’s name in Chinese characters and on that basis urged this court to infer that they belonged to the Plaintiff. But even assuming that is correct, and even if I were to assume that the files accessed on the external hard disk belonged to the Plaintiff, it remained for the Plaintiff to prove that the information contained in those files were confidential. Not all information on an employer’s computer can be cloaked with confidentiality. As the Court of Appeal held in _Stratech Systems Ltd v Nyam Chiu Shin (alias Yan Qiuxin) and others_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 2 SLR(R) 579</span> at \[36\], it is too sweeping to say that password-protected information had to be confidential information. In this connection, the court in _Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and other_s <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 163</span> (“_Clearlab_”) took a similar approach towards some of the items which it found to lack confidentiality because they were “stated in very general terms, and unsubstantiated with any evidence” (at \[127(a)\]. Without reviewing the information allegedly transferred to the external hard disk, I was unable to assess whether such information is sufficiently confidential. In this regard, it is trite that the information has to be “relatively inaccessible to the public” in order to attain the quality of confidence (_Invenpro (M) Sdn Bhd v JCS Automation Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1045</span> at \[130(a)\]).

24     The Plaintiff may argue that it did not adduce such evidence as the files have been deleted by the 1st Defendant. While superficially attractive, such argument ignores the fact that the Plaintiff could have instructed the forensic expert, Mr Lau, to recover the deleted files from the Computer, but decided against doing so. In this regard, Mr Lau categorically stated on the stand that he was not instructed to attempt recovery of the deleted files, and that there was a possibility that the deleted files could have been recovered had he been instructed to do so.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) Indeed, Ms Choong testified that while the email application has been deleted from the Computer, the raw data of the email application from the Computer could still be found in a folder titled “ena@erisingapore.com” which was the 1st Defendant’s corporate email address. A screenshot of this folder was exhibited in her AEIC.[^14] It appears from the screenshot that there were several gigabytes of data stored in this folder. No satisfactory explanation was given when I queried counsel for the Plaintiff why the Plaintiff did not commission the forensic expert to study this data.[^15] Further, the 1st Defendant explained both in her email dated 11 February 2020 to Mr Chen and on the stand that she had always followed the company’s protocol of uploading documents onto the company’s server, from which the Plaintiff could retrieve if necessary.[^16] The Plaintiff did not lead evidence to refute this allegation. The 1st Defendant also explained on the stand that her colleagues would have had copies of the relevant documents she had handled because she merely served a conduit between the back office and the customers and did not personally generate corporate secretarial documents.[^17] This allegation was again not challenged or refuted by the Plaintiff. In these circumstances, the natural inference is that the Plaintiff could have adduced copies of the 12 LNK files that were opened on the external hard disk but chose not to do so.

25     Aside from the forensic report, the Plaintiff submitted that the fact that 31 of its customers migrated to the 1st Defendant “gives rise to a reasonable inference that the 1st Defendant had disclosed the Plaintiff’s confidential information to the 2nd Defendant”.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) This submission is in my view involves a leap of logic. Just because the Plaintiff’s customers decided to join the 1st Defendant does not necessarily mean that the 1st Defendant had misappropriated confidential information. They could have decided to switch service providers on their own accord. It is not uncommon for customers to follow employees when they leave to start their own business. It is trite law that the scope of protection afford to confidential information should not unreasonably encroach upon the employee’s ability to utilise their own skill and knowledge to compete with the former employer (_Clearlab_ at \[67\]). The Plaintiff led no evidence to show that the 1st Defendant utilised confidential information to solicit those customers. As the 1st Defendant explained on the stand, she had established personal rapport with these customers, and they decided to join her when she announced on her personal WeChat account of her leaving the Plaintiff.[^19] While client contact details may themselves be confidential, it could not be disputed that the employment terms did not expressly prohibit the 1st Defendant from communicating with the Plaintiff’s customers outside of work on social platforms such as her personal WeChat account.[^20] Further, the evidence shows that the 2nd Defendant had written to the Plaintiff requesting it to hand over the customers’ business records on the customers’ behalf, and there is no evidence that the Plaintiff did not or was unable to accede to the request.[^21] That the 2nd Defendant had to request for these records indicates that there was no need for the 1st Defendant to misappropriate the customer records to service these customers. The customers had the right to request the Plaintiff to hand over their business records. The Plaintiff submitted that those requests pertained only to “physical documents”. In my judgment, that allegation is wholly speculative and not borne out in evidence. The requests were not expressly confined to “physical documents”. In any event, the allegation was not put to the 1st Defendant when she took the stand.

26     Apart from customer contact details, the Plaintiff also pleaded and submitted that the 1st Defendant misused the Plaintiff’s “pricing schedule” to solicit the Plaintiff’s customers.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) I was unable to accord any weight to this allegation as it was once again bare and unsubstantiated. In this regard, Mr Chen conceded on the stand that, apart from the Forensic Report, the Plaintiff has no other evidence to prove the allegation that the 1st Defendant misused confidential information to solicit its customers.[^23] Mr Chen also agreed that, even going by the base paths of the 12 LNK files listed in the Forensic Report, there was no evidence that those files related to the 31 companies that migrated to the 2nd Defendant.[^24] Mr Chen also conceded that the 12 LNK files did not allude to the 1st Defendant copying the Plaintiff’s confidential information for the purposes of soliciting the Plaintiff’s customers.[^25]

27     There is then Ms Choong’s testimony that she had noticed that external hard disk contained “many files with data pertaining to her work for the Plaintiff”.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) I was unable to accord much weight to this statement due to its lack of specificity and particulars. No details whatsoever were given as to what “data” did she notice and accordingly I was unable to determine whether they had the necessary quality of confidence.

28     Much was made by the Plaintiff on the 1st Defendant having signed an “Employee Handbook” which contained express covenants prohibiting its employees from misusing confidential information. The 1st Defendant denied signing the document. It was not necessary for me to pronounce a finding on whether the 1st Defendant was subjected to express confidential obligations under her employment contract given my finding that the Plaintiff failed to prove that the 1st Defendant had misappropriated confidential information. Even if she was subjected to such duties – whether contractual or otherwise in equity – it remained for the Plaintiff to show that, first, the information had “the necessary quality of confidence”, second, that such information had been “imparted” to the 1st Defendant in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence (_I-Admin_ at \[20\] and \[61\]). On the second requirement, the court clarified that this includes cases where the information was accessed or acquired without the claimant’s knowledge or consent. In the present case, the Plaintiff did not adduce evidence to show that the 1st Defendant had acquired confidential information by way of an unauthorised transference to the external hard disk. The present facts are clearly distinguishable from the line of cases where courts have found a breach of confidence. I will discuss a few to illustrate this.

> (a)     In _I-Admin_, it was undisputed that the claimant’s materials were confidential and the defendants had acquired, circulated and referenced them without permission. It was on that basis that the court found that the defendants had “_prima facie_ breached” the obligation of confidentiality (at \[63\]). In the present case, there is insufficient evidence to establish confidentiality. There is also insufficient evidence to prove that the 1st Defendant had acquired the materials without the Plaintiff’s permission.

> (b)     In _Clearlab_, the claimants not only adduced evidence of the information in question to show that they attained the quality of confidence but also evidence that the defendants appropriated them without permission (at \[131\] and \[148\]-\[152\]). The court was able to make a finding on the issue of confidentiality because the information had not entered the public domain. In the present case, there is plainly no information for the court to assess as to whether they could be accessed from the public domain.

> (c)     In _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Yee Heng Khay (alias Roger)_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 168</span>, the claimant adduced evidence of the information appropriated by the defendant, namely, price and customer list as well as sales figures and targets for its suppliers. It was apparent that the underlying data was placed before the court for examination (at \[40\]). In those circumstances, the court found that the information was not readily accessible to the public and therefore confidential (at \[41\]-\[43\]). Further, it was undisputed that the defendant had taken information belonging to the claimant, by copying them onto a Universal Serial Bus (“USB”) device during his employment and not returning the USB device upon the termination of his employment (at \[20\]). It was in this context that the court found that a presumption of actionable breach of confidence arose (at \[46\]). In the present case, there is insufficient evidence to show that the 1st Defendant had transferred confidential information belonging to the Plaintiff onto the external hard disk.

29     For these reasons, I dismissed the breach of confidence claim.

### Deletion of data on the Computer

30     The Forensic Report shows that 8,203 files/folders were deleted from the Computer on 19 November 2019 at around 2.28 pm. It is undisputed that the 1st Defendant was in office on 19 November 2019 at around this time and her former colleagues, Mr Tay Sean Yew and Ms Zhang Shu Hui, testified that she was the only one seen using the Computer. The 1st Defendant herself also admitted in her email to Mr Chen dated 11 February 2020 that she was “clearing her desktop” when she returned to office on 19 November 2019.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) In my view, the Plaintiff had established on a balance of probabilities that the 1st Defendant deleted data on the Computer. It was not disputed that the 1st Defendant owed a duty of care under common law and under the employment contract not to delete documents belonging to the Plaintiff.

31     While the Plaintiff has established a breach of duty on the part of the 1st Defendant, it still had to show that it suffered losses as a result of the deletion. I was not persuaded that the Plaintiff suffered any real loss from the deletion for several reasons.

32     First, the evidence showed that while many folders/files were deleted from the Computer, as I have explained at \[24\] above, the raw data of the email application from the Computer had been preserved. The 1st Defendant’s evidence was that copies of the relevant documents handled by her during her employment could be found in her email account which the Plaintiff could retrieve if it so wished. Indeed, she invited the Plaintiff to retrieve the documents in her email dated 11 February 2020 to Mr Chen. In the same email, she further informed the Plaintiff that she had uploaded the relevant documents onto the company’s server.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) As these documents could be found on the company’s server, she explained that there was no need to keep a copy of those documents on her desktop. There is no evidence of the Plaintiff making any attempt to recover these documents from the company server or the raw data of the email application. No evidence was also led to show that it was not possible to recover the documents via the proposed methods.

33     Second, the 1st Defendant’s evidence was that she did not personally generate any documents. All customer documents were generated by her colleagues in the back office, and whatever documents that came through her email account would have been sent from or received by those colleagues, from whom the Plaintiff could retrieve copies. This allegation was not challenged by the Plaintiff when she was on the stand. There is no evidence that the Plaintiff was unable to recover the deleted documents from its other employees.

34     Third, shortly after the 1st Defendant ended her employment with the Plaintiff, the 2nd Defendant wrote to the Plaintiff on behalf of its customers asking the Plaintiff to hand over the customers’ business records to facilitate their migration to the 2nd Defendant. There is no suggestion that the Plaintiff was unable to retrieve the necessary documents as a result of the 1st Defendant deleting the data on the Computer. This shows that the Plaintiff continued to have access to the business records of their customers, at least insofar as the customers whose records were sought are concerned.

35     Fourth, even assuming the Plaintiff was unable to retrieve copies of the deleted files, it was not clear to me that the deletion had severely impeded their ability to service their existing customers. The Plaintiff did not adduce evidence of any services that they were unable to perform as a result of the deletion. The Plaintiff claims to have lost $314,161.90 in revenue that it could have potentially earned from the 31 companies that switched over to the 2nd Defendant.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) But the real reason it lost the revenue was because the 31 companies decided to switch over to the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff failed to establish any nexus between the 31 companies’ decision to change service providers and the deletion of the data. For instance, there was no evidence to suggest that the companies made the switch because they were of the view that the Plaintiff did not have the necessary data to continue servicing them. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that the companies made the switch on their own accord.

36     As the Plaintiff failed to prove that it had suffered a real loss by reason of the unauthorised deletion, I awarded nominal damages in the sum of $100.

## Conclusion

37     For the above reasons stated, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract in respect of the incorporation of the 2nd Defendant, the alleged misappropriation of confidential information and the deletion of data on the Computer.
