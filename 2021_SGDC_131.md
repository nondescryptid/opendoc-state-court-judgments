### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 25-year-old Singaporean male, faced a total of 33 charges for using a Malaysia registered vehicle no. PLU3284 (“the Malaysia Vehicle”) without a valid Vehicle Entry Permit or vehicle licence as well as exhibiting a forged Singapore licence plate no. “SJR7878A” on the Malaysia Vehicle when using it on multiple occasions between 1 December 2016 to 2 September 2017. He faced two additional charges of providing false information to a public servant, namely the investigation officers from the Traffic Police and Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) respectively, by claiming that he had rented the Malaysia vehicle with the forged licence plate on the online platform, Carousell, from a male subject since May or June 2016.

2       On 3 March 2021, the accused accepted the Prosecution’s offer and pleaded guilty before me to 14 proceeded charges with the remaining 21 charges being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. Thereafter the accused was sentenced as follows:

3       On 4 March 2021, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal because he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on him.

4       On 16 March 2021, I granted a stay of execution on the term of imprisonment pending the appeal with bail offered at $10,000. The accused has paid the fine in full.

### Statement of facts

6       The accused admitted to two sets of Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 22 December 2020 in respect of the LTA charges and 3 March 2021 in respect of the two s 182 PC charges respectively without qualification.

7       On 2 February 2017 and 4 May 2017, one black BMW 321i with licence plate no. “SJR7878A” was detected to be speeding along Central Expressway and Tampines Avenue 5 respectively. Police investigations revealed that the in-vehicle unit in this vehicle had belonged to another vehicle that was exported to Jordan on 16 June 2016 and the licence plate no. “SJR7878A” displayed on the vehicle was false.

8       The police subsequently managed to trace this black BMW with the false licence plate to the accused’s residence located at Flora Road.

9       On 2 September 2017 at about 11.30 am along Old Tampines Road, a traffic police officer stopped and detained the accused, who was driving the said black BMW bearing the false licence plate no. “SJR7878A” at the material time. The accused was driving his mother and girlfriend to Tampines Mall for lunch. The motorcar was thereafter impounded for investigations.

10     Following the arrest on 2 September 2017, the accused admitted to being the driver at the material time on 2 February 2017 and 4 May 2017 when the black BMW bearing the false licence plate no. “SJR7878A” was detected to be speeding.

11     On 9 September 2017 at about 8 pm at the Traffic Police Headquarters, the accused gave a statement to Senior Station Inspector Tan Chin Yong stating the following in that he had:

> a.     Rented the black BMW with the licence plate no. “SJR7878A” from a male subject on Carousell, which is an online platform, since May/July 2016;

> b.     Contacted the male subject on his mobile no. at XXX. The accused’s own mobile no. was XXX;

> c.     Met the male subject at Geylang Road to take receipt of the said black BMW and paid the male subject $8520 as six months’ rental;

> d.     Next met the male subject in January 2017 to extend the rental period for another six months and he paid the male subject $5520; and

> e.     Not known that the licence plate no. “SJR7878A” was false.

12     On 17 October 2017 at about 1.55pm, the accused gave a similar statement at the LTA to investigation officer Koh Bee Chee Veron. The accused further provided screenshots of his messages with the alleged male subject. The screenshots did not show the complete set of messages. The mobile phone number of the alleged male subject was also not visible in these screenshots.

13     In the course of their investigations, the authorities had to, _inter alia_, check with Carousell and the other witnesses to verify the accused’s story. Resources were also expended to locate witnesses in Malaysia.

14     Subsequent investigations revealed that both the mobile phone numbers XXX and XXX provided by the accused were tagged to the same Carousell account.

15     On 1 November 2017 at about 2.30 pm, an LTA Engineer inspected the motorcar and found that the engraved vehicle chassis and engine numbers were PM13B18050P592890 and B1370756N20B20B respectively. A check with the LTA records showed that no records existed for both the vehicle chassis and engine numbers.

16     In fact, LTA records confirmed that the vehicle registration no. SJR7878A was a live registration no. belonging to a white colour BMW 3201i bearing the chassis and engine numbers of WBA3B16070NS51554 and N20B20B45A3914A017 respectively.

17     A check with the Malaysian Road Transport Department (Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan) regarding the identity of the vehicle chassis and engine numbers revealed that the engine no. B1370756N20B20B belonged to the Malaysia Vehicle no. PLU3284. LTA’s Foreign Vehicle Permit records further revealed that the last exit record of the said Malaysia Vehicle from Singapore was on 8 December 2015. Hence, there was no valid Vehicle Entry Permit for the usage of the Malaysia Vehicle in Singapore after 8 December 2015.

18     Investigations by the authorities further revealed that the accused and two other people, namely Toh Zhen Han and Wong Su Soon, had entered Singapore in a Malaysia registered black BMW 321i bearing the licence plate no. PLU3284 on 28 January 2016 at about 11.48am. At the material time, the accused was a passenger in the Malaysia vehicle. On the same day at about 1.13pm, the three of them left Singapore for Malaysia in a Singapore registered motorcar with licence plate no. SGG2780Z. This motorcar belonged to the accused’s father.

19     From 28 January 2016 to the time when the accused was stopped by the Traffic Police on 2 September 2017, there was no record of the Malaysia vehicle leaving Singapore.

20     Following from there, there was no valid vehicle licence in force for the Malaysia Vehicle since 28 January 2016 as the accused, who is a citizen of Singapore, was keeping or using the Malaysia Vehicle in Singapore without paying the chargeable road tax on the said vehicle.

21     The accused was also discovered to have used the Malaysia Vehicle with the false licence plate no. “SJR7878A” on at least 3 other occasions, i.e. on 1 December 2016, 15 February 2017 and 21 February 2017 as the said vehicle was detected to have passed through the ERP gantries.

22     It was only in 2019 that the accused admitted to the authorities that he had earlier provided false information to them. In fact, he did not correspond with anyone on Carousell to rent the Malaysia Vehicle. He further admitted to renting the Malaysia Vehicle from a contact in Malaysia and changing the licence plate no. to “SJR7878A” for use in Singapore knowing that the licence plate was false.

## Antecedents

23     The accused was traced for a non-traffic related conviction as follows:

24     The accused also compounded his speeding offence on 2 February 2017 for $150.

25     The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

26     The Prosecution sought for a sentence of at least one month’s imprisonment for each of the s 182 PC charge and at least two to four weeks’ imprisonment for each of the s 129(2)(d) RTA charge. It further sought for the sentence of one of the s 182 PC charges to run consecutively with the sentences of two of the s 129(2)(d) RTA charges.

27     Therefore, the Prosecution was seeking for a global sentence of at least two to three months’ imprisonment. As for the remaining charges, the Prosecution was leaving the sentences to the court based on the usual fine tariffs.

28     In respect of the s 182 PC charge, the Prosecution relied on the High Court’s decision of _Koh Yong Chiah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 253</span> (_“Koh Yong Chiah”_) for the principle that the custodial threshold is crossed where the degree of harm caused or likely to be caused by the offence is appreciable. In particular, the Prosecution referred to the cases at \[24\] of _Koh Yong Chiah_ where a person had given false information to the authorities to shield himself from investigation or prosecution.

29     In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that the custodial threshold was clearly crossed. The accused made the false statements in 2017. This led to a lengthy investigation by the authorities (both the Traffic Police and LTA). The authorities even had to locate witnesses in Malaysia. The accused lied to protect himself from prosecution. Precious government resources were utilised to investigate into the case. It was only two years later in 2019 that the accused admitted to making the false statements when he was confronted with the evidence which arose from the investigations.

30     Consequently, the accused was only charged in court in February 2020. The long delay was completely caused by the accused as he failed to come clean with the truth after he was arrested in 2017. Therefore, the Prosecution argued that the circumstances in the present case was more egregious than the typical traffic offences where two weeks’ imprisonment were generally imposed to offenders as a starting point for providing false information upon arrest, e.g. at roadblocks where the false information given is typically spontaneous and not premeditated. A sentence of one month’s imprisonment was hence warranted.

31     As for the s 129(2)(d) of the RTA charges, the Prosecution relied on the High Court’s decision of _Chong Jiajun Eugene v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 285</span> (_“Eugene Chong”_) for the proposition that the custodial threshold has been crossed as the accused had fraudulently switched the Malaysia licence plate no. with the false Singapore licence plate no. in order to avoid detection and thwart enforcement efforts when he drove the Malaysia Vehicle in Singapore until he was arrested.

32     In particular, the Prosecution submitted that the accused had brought the Malaysia Vehicle into Singapore without a valid entry permit and he used the said vehicle as a Singapore citizen without paying the relevant road tax and insurance when driving it in Singapore. He was caught using the Malaysia Vehicle on multiple occasions. As such, a custodial sentence of at least two to four weeks’ imprisonment for each of the s 129(2)(d) of the RTA charge was warranted.

33     Moreover, the fake licence plate no. “SJR7878A” belonged to a live vehicle, a similar BMW make and model which was white in colour. The only distinction was the colour of the vehicles This caused actual harm to an innocent victim in the form of inconvenience when he was alleged to have committed traffic violations when the actual perpetrator was the accused. But for the diligence of the prosecuting authorities, the deception created by the accused could have been difficult to detect. The period of deception was also long from January 2016 till he was arrested in September 2017, amounting to about one- and three-quarter years.

## Mitigation

34     The Defence tendered written submissions and requested the court to call for a probation suitability report with the view of placing the accused on probation. Alternatively, the Defence argued that a sentence to high fines for the charges would suffice as just punishment to the accused.

35     In respect of the Defence’s request for calling of the probation suitability report, the Defence highlighted that the accused was born on 9 April 1996. Hence, some of the offences were committed by the accused when he was under the age of 21 years old, i.e. prior to 9 April 2017. This was prior to his arrest on 2 September 2017 when he was already 21 years old. Even at the time of his arrest, he should be considered a youthful offender. The police were also investigating into the offences that were committed by him prior to him turning 21 years old at that time.

36     The Defence cited the case of _A Karthik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 202</span> (_“Karthik”_) for the proposition that offenders who are above the age of 21 years old could still be sentenced to probation in appropriate cases. S 5 of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed) (“POA”) also does not have a requirement that a probation order cannot be made once an offender turns 21 years old.

37     The Defence therefore argued that the key sentencing consideration ought to be rehabilitation in this case. Firstly, there is the retrospective rationale where the court should take into consideration that the accused had committed some of the offences when he was a youthful offender. The fact that he was already above 21 years old at the time of sentencing was not a bar towards imposing a probation order. The accused deserved a second chance due to his youthful folly, immaturity and inexperience.

38     The Defence submitted that the accused was not a bad boy but a self-made man. During his free time, the accused was passionate in helping stray animals like dogs and cats. Since his secondary school days, he volunteered with Save Our Street Dogs (“SOSD”), which is a welfare organisation dedicated to protecting street dogs. His secondary school teacher, who is also a member of SOSD, praised the accused for being passionate in helping stray and injured dogs.

39     According to the Defence, this passion led to him committing the present offences. In late January 2016, while the accused was shopping in Johor, he met a male Malaysian Chinese selling handphones and accessories. The said man suggested to the accused to rent or buy a Malaysia Vehicle. If asked, he could say that he had rented it from Carousell, the online platform. The accused, who was then 19 years old, was young inexperienced and immature. He agreed to rent a Malaysia car from the Malaysian man even though he had very little knowledge of driving a foreign vehicle in Singapore.

40     The accused had wanted to rent the Malaysia car because he had wanted to use it to attend to and pick up injured stray animals from the streets for treatment. Ordinarily, he would have relied on taxis but it was difficult to find taxi drivers who were willing to ferry injured animals.

41     After he had rented the Malaysia Vehicle PLU3284, it was driven into Singapore by a Malaysian driver and parked at the Accused’s residence. Subsequently, he learnt that as a Singaporean, he could not drive a Malaysia vehicle without the valid permission of the relevant authorities.

42     However, he was determined to attend to the stray animals. It was because of his passion for these animals that he decided to put up a forged Singapore licence plate no. “SJR7878A” on the Malaysia Vehicle. Using this forged licence plate no. on the Malaysia Vehicle, he would drive around Singapore to look out for stray animals which needed his help and tended to them. He said he had done so on 11 occasions between 1 December 2016 to 2 September 2017. He committed these offences without any personal benefit nor did he obtain any financial gain.

43     When he gave the false information to the authorities, even though he had already turned 21 years old, it was neither premediated nor planned. He merely repeated the story which he was told to say by the Malaysian man whom he believed.

44     Secondly, there is the prospective rationale where accused has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform and there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation in this case. The Defence referred to the three-limbed framework for assessing an offender’s propensity for reform in _PP v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ \[2020\] (_“Terence Siow”_) at \[3\] to \[7\].

45     Under the first limb, the accused has a positive desire to change. In 2019, he admitted to the police for committing the offences. He has pleaded guilty to the offences to save the courts time and resources as he was deeply remorseful and regretful of his actions. He did not commit any previous similar offences. Moreover, the offences committed by him, given that they were regulatory offences, were not serious and heinous when compared to the offences committed by the 22-year-old offender in _Terence Siow_.

46     Under the second limb, the Defence submitted that there was a conducive environment in the accused’s life to help him turn over a new leaf.

47     The accused is a regular military expert with the Republic of Singapore Navy (“RSN”). He currently resides with his parents and sister. His father is a Grab driver and mother is a housewife. His family is supportive of him.

48     On 12 November 2014, when he was a RSN regular trainee, he was awarded a four-year Military Domain Experts Scheme Study Award (Diploma) bond. With the sponsorship, he enrolled and completed a diploma with merit in Clean Energy with Temasek Polytechnic. Upon completion of his studies, he joined the RSN as a regular military expert on 13 March 2017 and started serving his four-year scholarship bond, which would conclude on 14 March 2021 after 4 years.

49     The Defence highlighted that the accused not only excelled in his education but also with the RSN where he received various certificates and awards. He is a go-getter as can be seen from his achievements. His colleagues in the RSN wrote testimonials on his behalf.

50     On 6 June 2017, the accused was offered a place by the National University of Singapore for the degree of electrical engineering but this has been deferred to the academic year of 2021/2022 upon the completion of his bond with the RSN. The accused has a bright future ahead of him.

51     In the circumstances, the Defence submitted that the accused has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform. His potential for reform was great as the accused had no other brushes with the law since then. He has learnt a bitter lesson from this episode and does not have a proclivity for reoffending. There were hence no risk factors present as per the third limb.

52     If a custodial sentence was imposed on the accused, he would certainly lose his job with the RSN and his place at the university. He would no longer be able to fulfil his ambition to be an engineer. This would be devasting for his long future ahead of him. There were exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation and the accused therefore hoped to be given a second chance in life.

53     If the court was not minded to the calling of the probation suitability report, the Defence submitted that the alternative appropriate sentence would be high fines for all the charges. However, the Defence left the appropriate fine amounts for the respective charges to the court.

54     As regards the s 182 PC charge, the Defence submitted that the custodial threshold was not crossed as no appreciable harm to other persons or property was caused and the accused’s culpability was low. It cited the cases of _Koh Yong Chiah_ at \[1\] and \[2\] and _Yong Suan Piau Steven v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 224</span> at \[47\] (_“Steven Yong”_).

55     In the accused’s case, the Defence pointed out that there was no wastage of investigative resources because the police officer had already stopped the accused’s car at random for an inspection on the material day. Thus, such resources would have been spent independently of the lie. It would take very little effort for the LTA offer at the scene to do a quick inspection of the Malaysia Vehicle to verify that the chassis number of the said car did not exist in LTA’s records resulting in it being impounded for investigations.

56     Moreover, the predicate offences did not raise any serious public policy considerations. They were even less serious than other road traffic offences such as speeding, driving under disqualification, driving without a licence, dangerous driving and drink driving, which have a significant risk of harm to persons or damage to property.

57     The Defence therefore urged the court to follow _Steven Yong_ where the High Court imposed a fine of $4,000 on the offender.

58     As for the s 129(2)(d) charge, the Defence relied on _Eugene Chong_ to argue that the custodial threshold was similarly not crossed in the accused’s case. The accused culpability was low here. There was further no evidence of actual harm or inconvenience caused by the accused’s offences.

59     In the accused’s case, the accused had changed the licence plate of the Malaysia Vehicle with a false Singapore licence plate so that he could use it for attending to stray animals. His motive was quite innocent and naive. He did not do so to facilitate the commissioning of some other offences. The regulatory violations of using a vehicle without a valid Vehicle Entry Permit or vehicle licence flowed or arose from the s 129(2)(d) RTA charge.

60     Like the accused in _Eugene Chong_ who received a fine of $5,000 for affixing a false licence plate no. “SQ1H” on his rented sports car no. SKD2284H, the Defence urged this court to similarly impose a high fine on the accused.

61     Lastly, as for the charges relating to using a vehicle without a valid Vehicle Entry Permit or vehicle licence, the Defence submitted a fine range of between $200 to $400.

## Reply

62     The Prosecution informed the court that the accused had never mentioned in the course of police investigations that he had committed the offence for the purpose of ferrying stray animals. The letter from SOSD about the accused volunteering with them to take care of stray animals was undated.

63     In any case, when he was stopped by the Traffic Police on 2 September 2017, it was not due to a random inspection as mentioned by the Defence. As part of the investigations, the Traffic Police had to trace the accused to his residential address. They managed to arrest him in the vicinity of his residence because at the material time, he was driving the Malaysia Vehicle with the fake “SJR7878A” licence plate and was sending his mother and girlfriend out for lunch.

64     As such, it was untrue that he had only used the Malaysia Vehicle to ferry stray animals around. Furthermore, there was a waste of public resources by the authorities to investigate into the matter and hunt the accused down. Significant time and effort were required. This included the road traffic offences like speeding that the accused had committed using the Malaysia Vehicle with the fake Singapore licence plate.

65     There was also inconvenience caused to the owner of the vehicle bearing the genuine Singapore licence plate. The said owner was a victim of the offences committed by the accused as the Traffic Police would have sent the notices of the offences to the former. Hence, it could not be said that there was no actual harm or inconvenience due to the accused’s offences

66     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the charges which the accused was facing were distinct offences. The fake licence plate had made it easier for the accused to drive the Malaysia Vehicle in Singapore to avoid detection. He knew that without the fake licence plate, he could not, as a Singaporean, be driving the Malaysia Vehicle without obtaining and paying for a valid Vehicle Entry Permit as well as a vehicle licence. Even after his arrest, he refused to admit to the offences and kept up with the falsehood that he had rented the Malaysia vehicle on Carousell for about two years. He only came clean with the truth when investigations from the authorities produced contrary evidence.

67     For the following reasons, the Prosecution submitted that the accused should not be treated as a youthful offender but an adult offender. Correspondingly, a global sentence of at least two to three months’ imprisonment was justified.

## Decision on sentence

68     The three issues before the court was as follows:

> (a)     Whether the accused should be considered a youthful offender for sentencing purposes;

> (b)     Whether the court should call for the probation suitability report; and

> (c)     If not, what should be the appropriate sentence to impose on the accused.

### The accused should not be considered a youthful offender

69     I agreed with the Defence’s proposition that an offender who is above the age of 21 years old could still be sentenced to probation. There is no age-based restriction as to when a court is permitted to make a probation order under s 5 of the POA so long as the offender is not convicted of an offence for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law.

70     Section 5(1) of the POA reads as follows:

>      **Probation**

> **5.**—(1)    Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the opinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision of a probation officer or a volunteer probation officer for a period to be specified in the order of not less than 6 months nor more than 3 years:

>> Provided that where a person is convicted of an offence for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law, the court may make a probation order if the person —

>>> (_a_) has attained the age of 16 years but has not attained the age of 21 years at the time of his conviction; and

>>> (_b_) has not been previously convicted of such offence referred to in this proviso, and for this purpose section 11(1) shall not apply to any such previous conviction.

71     Age, nonetheless, is a critical factor in the court’s determination of whether an offender should be granted probation in lieu of imprisonment. In _Karthik_ at \[33\] and \[34\], the High Court held that this is because rehabilitation is placed at the forefront of the court’s deliberation when considering probation as a sentencing option. Where youthful offenders are involved, the law takes a presumptive view that the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation. This presumption does not apply to adult offenders who are above the age of 21.

72     Therefore, when sentencing adult offenders, rehabilitation would only be regarded as the operative consideration if the particular offender concerned “_demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or there are exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation_ \[emphasis added\] as stated at \[28\] of _Goh Lee Yin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 1 SLR 530</span>.

73     Further, in _Karthik_, Sundaresh Menon CJ explained the twin retrospective and prospective rationales underlying the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offenders at \[37\]:

> (a)    First, there is the _retrospective_ rationale, which seeks to justify giving a young offender a second chance by excusing his actions on the grounds of his youthful folly and inexperience. This rationale rests on the offender’s age _at the time of the offence_, in so far as it emphasises his relative lack of maturity and his state of mind when he was committing the offence.

> (b)    Second, there is the _prospective_ rationale, which seeks to justify rehabilitation as the preferred tool to discourage future offending on the grounds that: (i) young offenders would be more receptive towards a sentencing regime aimed at altering their values and guiding them on the right path; (ii) society would stand to benefit considerably from the rehabilitation of young offenders, who have many potentially productive and constructive years ahead of them; and (iii) young offenders appear to suffer disproportionately when exposed to the typical punitive options, such as imprisonment, as compared to adult offenders. These considerations rest on the offender’s age _at the time of sentencing_, in so far as they emphasise his mentality and outlook at the time when he is facing the consequences of his earlier criminal conduct. \[emphasis in original\]

74     Menon CJ added at \[43\] - \[45\] that subject to two observations that:

> (a)     it is necessary to examine the specific facts in every case, including the particular circumstances of the offender and the offence; and

> (b)     there are any express statutory limitations that lawfully constrains the court’s powers,

the twin rationales may be relevant in considering the sentencing approaches to be taken for offenders on either side of the threshold age. A summary of the application of the twin rationales are as follows:

76     The accused’s offences were committed over a period of time since he was 20 years old. He continued to use the Malaysia Vehicle with the fake Singapore licence plate for his own personal convenience despite achieving adulthood. But for the fact that he was arrested and his vehicle was impounded, he would have continued to commit the offences.

77     Furthermore, the accused became bolder after he turned 21 years old. When he was arrested, he was already 21 years old. Despite that, he committed the offence of giving false information to a public servant, not only once but twice. His actions were plainly premeditated. It is pertinent to point out the accused was himself already a public servant at the material time. This was quite in contrast with the offender in _PP v Chia Shu Xuan_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 369</span>, as cited by the Defence. In that case, even though the offender was charged and convicted after he was 21 years old, he was effectively considered a youthful offender and all his offences were committed when he was under the age of 21 years old.

78     Having considered the facts and the nature as well as the pattern in which the offences were committed by the accused, I was of the view that the prospective rationale should not apply and even if applied, should not be strong. As for the retrospective rationale, I was of the similar view that this should not apply given that the accused continued to commit the same and other offences after he turned 21 years old. He should be, unless if exceptional reasons could be shown, be treated as an adult offender. Even if I was wrong, any application should be accorded little weight.

79     Also, I agreed with the Prosecution that any delay in charging the accused in court on 5 February 2020 was entirely due to the fault of the accused. This clearly arose directly from the false statements given by him in September and October 2017. He only admitted to the falsehood two years later in 2019 when confronted with the evidence from police investigations. As such, the facts here can be distinguished from _Karthik_ as the offender there had committed all the offences before he turned 21 years old in June 2012 but was only arrested and charged 4 years in August 2016.

80     Even where an offender is responsible for the delay in prosecution, it was held by the High Court in _Karthik_ at \[57\] that such a delay can be used to assess the progress that the accused had achieved in his rehabilitation since the commission of his offence and in turn determine whether he should be treated as a youthful offender.

81     The fact that the accused had only come clean with the truth two years later in view of the evidence from the police investigations further indicated to me that the trajectory of the accused’s rehabilitative progress in the intervening period was not good. Even more so after he turned 21 years old. He could have come clean after he was arrested if he had only intended to use the vehicle to rescue stray animals. He did not. In fact, he perpetuated the falsehood to avoid prosecution. He provided the police with false evidence by generating his own screenshots of messages with the alleged Malaysian subject and using mobile numbers that were tagged to the same Carousell account traced to him. This was obviously deliberate and pre-planned.

82     Much public resources were therefore wasted for the past two years because of the accused’s false statement. It was only when confronted with incriminating evidence against him that he had no other alternative but to admit to his wrongdoings.

83     Having considered all the circumstances and the facts of the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that it was inappropriate to treat the accused as a youthful offender but an adult offender instead.

### It was inappropriate in the present circumstances to call for a probation suitability report

84     Since I was of the view that the accused should be treated as an adult offender in the present case, the presumption that the primary or dominant sentencing consideration of rehabilitation is inapplicable. Even if I were wrong, the sentencing principle of rehabilitation must be decreased and even overshadowed by the need for a higher level of deterrence and retribution in this case. The type or nature of the offence rather than the characteristics of the offender plays a major role in deciding whether to place offenders on probation.

85     In _PP v Lim Chee Yin Jordan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1294</span> and _Terence Siow_ as cited by the Defence, the sentences of probation of the adult offenders were overturned by the High Court on appeal to custodial sentences because the offences concerned were not only serious, the offenders did not demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or show exceptional circumstances to warrant a sentence of probation to be ordered.

86     Given the strong public interest and the seriousness of the offences committed by the accused, I agreed with the Prosecution that a deterrent effect, both general and specific, is necessary to deter likeminded citizens from committing similar acts. Not only much public resources were utilised to investigate into the matter, including cross border investigations, there was also actual harm and inconvenience caused to others.

87     Additionally, I disagreed with the Defence’s submission that the predicate offences did not raise any serious public policy considerations. An innocent vehicle owner was directly affected by the accused’s actions. The accused’s Malaysia vehicle did not have the requisite road tax and mandatory insurance coverage. Should any accident occur, the potential harm caused to other road users could not be said to be insignificant.

88     It is equally important to note the limited deterrent effect of probation orders as the key role of probation is rehabilitation and not deterrence. In _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR 449</span>, VK Rajah JA opined at \[55\]-\[56\]:

> \[55\]  \[I\]n my view, _in so far as it is suggested that such inherent discipline translates into some form of deterrence, more specific than general, and such deterrent effect would be penumbral at best_. The key principle at play in probation would primarily be rehabilitation and not deterrence. …

> 56    \[T\]hey do exert some form of deterrence, but such deterrence, generally speaking, must be regarded as being relatively modest in nature. \[emphasis added\]

89     Hence probation was, in my view, an inappropriate sentencing option. This would be too light touch an approach given the nature of the offences and level of deterrence required. Moreover, for the reasons as stated above, the accused was unable to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform and/or that there were exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of probation. The fact that he might lose his job with the RSN and his place at the university to study engineering could not, contrary to the Defence’s suggestion, be considered as exceptional circumstances. It is pertinent to note that when he committed the offences, he had already completed his studies by March 2017 and was serving out his bond with the RSN for his scholarship as a regular.

90     In the circumstances, I declined to call for a probability suitability report.

### The most appropriate sentence to impose

91     In respect of the s 182 PC charge for providing false statement to a public servant, the relevant provision at the material time states:

> 182.  Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

92     The High Court in _Koh Yong Chiah_ identified the main ways in which a s 182 offences have been committed in Singapore. They are persons who gave false information to:

> (a)     wrongfully report innocent persons to the police;

> (b)     shield himself from investigation or prosecution by the authorities;

> (c)     shield another person from investigation or prosecution by the authorities;

> (d)     subvert a public institution’s screening process;

> (e)     facilitate fraud on a third party to gain some personal benefit;

> (f)     deal with matters relating to the offender’s employment and the performance of his duties as a public servant.

93     The accused’s case fell under (b) where he had given false information to shield himself from investigation or prosecution by the authorities. Based on the cases which fell under (b) as listed at \[24\] in _Koh Yong Chiah_, a custodial sentence was usually imposed with a starting point of two weeks’ imprisonment. The sentence meted out would depend on the:

> (i)     complexity of the deceptive scheme employed on the public servant;

> (ii)     seriousness of the offence the offender sought to cover up; and

> (iii)     extent to which public resources were wasted because of the false information (at \[25\]).

94     Given the broad nature of the s 182 offence, the High Court provided some broad guidance as to the type of cases that would generally attract a custodial sentence as a starting point. The High Court, at \[50\], was of the view that whether the custodial threshold is crossed should be determined based on the degree of harm or likely to be caused by the s 182 offence. If _appreciable harm may be caused by the s 182 offence, the courts should, as a starting point, impose a custodial term_. The range of harm that may ensue includes personal injury, loss of liberty, financial loss or harm arising from the waste of public investigative resources \[emphasis added\].

95     At \[55\] of _Koh Yong Chiah_, several qualifications to the test of appreciable harm were listed to include:

> (i)     Harm caused must be causally connected to the provision of false information;

> (ii)     Harm caused must be more than _de minimis_;

> (iii)     Harm refers to both actual and potential harm;

> (iv)     Potential harm caused by the offence is usually assessed with reference to the duration that the falsehood was maintained; and

> (v)     The test of “appreciable harm” is not capable of being applied with scientific precision.

96     In my view, applying the test of appreciable harm, appreciable harm was clearly caused by the accused for the offence of giving false information to both the Traffic Police and LTA. The false information included providing false evidence created by the accused (e.g. the screenshots of fake messages and mobile numbers all linked to the accused and his Carousell account). As a result of the false information, the authorities had to check with Carousell and other witnesses (e.g. Teo Zhen Han and Wong Su Soon) to verify the accused’s story that he had merely unknowingly rented the Malaysia Vehicle with the fake licence plate on Carousell. Resources were expended to obtain evidence and locate witnesses in Malaysia and this resulted in lengthy, unnecessary and time-consuming investigations being conducted.

97     There was also potential harm caused here as the accused had maintained the falsehood for about two years. He did not voluntarily recant to the false statement. Therefore, I agreed with the Prosecution that the custodial threshold was clearly crossed in this case.

98     The accused’s level of culpability was also not low. He not only knew that the two statements given were false, he knew that harm was likely to be caused. The false statements were made voluntarily by him as an adult. Further, the false evidence given was not done spontaneously but required some form of planning and taking deliberate steps on his part to bolster his deception and evade prosecution. Thus, I rejected the Defence argument that the accused had given the false statements because he was immature and he had simply believed what the Malaysian man told him to say if arrested.

99     All things considered, I agreed with the Prosecution that the overall conduct of the accused was more egregious than the typical road traffic offences where two weeks’ imprisonment was generally imposed as a starting point for providing false information in situations where they were given spontaneously or when the accused recanted to the false statements soon after they were given.

100    I therefore imposed a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment in respect of each of the proceeded s 182 PC charges.

101    For the same reason, I disagreed with the Defence’s reliance on _Steven Yong_ for a fine to be imposed, which can be distinguished on its facts. In that case, the offender gave false information to a customs officer when he was stopped at the Woodlands checkpoint for inspection. He falsely declared to the customs officer that his car had at least a ¾ full tank and was convicted under s 129(1)(c) of the Customs Act (Cap 70, 2004 Rev Ed). A fine of $4,000 was imposed by the High Court as (a) the customs officer had already chosen to stop the offender’s car for an inspection and thus resources were already spent independently of the lie; (b) it would take very little effort for the customs officer to inspect the vehicle further; and (c) the predicate offence under s 136 of the Customs Act did not involve any risk of harm to other persons or damage to property or raise any serious public policy considerations.

102    As for the offence of affixing to a vehicle an unissued plate under s 129(2)(d) of the RTA punishable under s 192(2)(iii), this provision reads as follows:

>     (2) If any person —

>> …

>> (d)    exhibits upon any vehicle or trailer any licence or identification mark, plate or document which has been forged, altered, defaced, mutilated or added to or any colourable imitation of a licence, mark, plate or document which is required under this Act to be carried on a vehicle or trailer;

>> …

>> he shall, _unless he establishes to the satisfaction of the court that he acted without intent to deceive_, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to be punished as follows:

>>> …

>>> (iii)   in any other case, with a fine not exceeding $5,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or with both. \[emphasis added\]

103    I agreed with the Prosecution that as the nature of this offence is such that there was an intention by the offender to deceive the authorities in order to facilitate the commission of other offences and avoid detection, this offence would ordinarily warrant a custodial sentence for an adult offender.

104    The Prosecution’s position is in line with the decision of the High Court in _Eugene Chong_ where it was held at \[22\]:

>     It would in fact be very likely that, in other cases, false number plates affixed in order to facilitate the commission of other offences. I would emphasise that a custodial term is still warranted in such cases. Imprisonment of two weeks upwards should be expected even if they may be relatively minor offences such as evasion of ERP, and _I would venture to suggest that a longer term in the range of four weeks would be appropriate where there is non-payment of road tax and/or insurance._ There will also be aggravated offences for which more substantial sentences of imprisonment would be warranted, such as where false number plates are used on stolen cars or to facilitate the commission of more serious offences like drug trafficking, robbery, immigration or customs offences, to name just a few. In such cases, the intent to evade detection is manifestly clear and the starting point for the sentencing court would be to consider a sentence of three months’ imprisonment upwards. \[emphasis added\]

105    Here, the accused had duplicated a live Singapore licence plate of another BMW car to affix on his own Malaysia Vehicle, which was also a BMW with the same model albeit a different colour, before using it. This was intended to avoid paying for the relevant taxes chargeable and motor insurance on his Malaysia Vehicle. It was a calculated act done with an intent to deceive the authorities.

106    Unlike what was suggested by the Defence, the accused surely must have committed the offences with the objective of achieving a personal benefit or obtaining a financial gain by saving on paying road tax and motor insurance for almost two years. Without the mandatory third-party insurance coverage, as mentioned earlier other road users are at risk should the accused use the Malaysia Vehicle in Singapore. Unfortunately, such offences are difficult to detect. When the accused committed other traffic offences like speeding while using the fake Singapore licence plate, it was difficult for the authorities to trace him as the actual offender. Instead, the actual innocent registered owner was implicated. The Traffic Police had to utilise further time and resources to trace the actual offender to the accused before arresting him.

107    Consequently, there is a need to protect public safety and interest to avoid harm. Defence counsel’s submission that traffic offences are not serious offences was certainly misconceived. The present case was quite a contrast from the facts in _Eugene Chong_, which involved an offender who was similarly convicted for an offence under s 129(2)(d) of the RTA but he had affixed a fancy fake licence plate of “SQ1H” over a validly registered Singapore rented vehicle to “feel rich” and “look good”.

108    On the facts here, an adult offender would likely face a custodial sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment as stated in _Eugene Chong_.

109    In a subsequent case of _PP v Lee Kim Yen_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 156</span> (_Lee Kim Yen_”), _Eugene Chong_ was followed. There, the accused was charged and convicted for (besides 6 other charges) affixing false vehicle plate on a Singapore registered motorcar under s 129(2)(e) of the RTA. The accused claimed trial and at the trial, it was found that she had affixed the false vehicle plate to evade detection of the finance company so that the latter would not be able to track the vehicle down and re-possess it for her non-payment of the instalments. She also committed traffic violations with the false vehicle plate and drove the motorcar without road tax and insurance. Prior to these set of offences, she was untraced. The District Court held at \[66\]:

>     In keeping with the guidelines and framework of _Chong Jiajun Eugene v Public Prosecutor_ \[2016\] 1 SLR3654, which I find to be wholly applicable to this present case (notwithstanding that the charges concerned were different but with an identical gravamen), I shared the Prosecution’s view that an imprisonment term of _not less than 4 weeks_ was necessary. Prosecution also submitted precedents which showed that an imprisonment term of 4 weeks have consistently been imposed by the courts where false licence plates were used on unlicensed or uninsured vehicles. \[emphasis added\]

110    The accused in _Lee Kim Yen_ was eventually sentenced to 5 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 129(2)(e) of the RTA offence.

111    All in all, having considered the number of s 129(2)(d) of the RTA charges (including the TIC charges), I was of the view that a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for each of the proceeded charges.

112    Finally, I come to the using a vehicle without a valid Vehicle Entry Permit or vehicle licence in force charges. S 15(a) of the RTA and r 20H(1)(a) of the RT(IC)R respectively read as follows:

> 15.    Any person who uses or keeps on any road any vehicle for which a licence is not in force, not being a vehicle exempted from tax under this Act by virtue of the provisions of any written law, shall be guilty of an offence and —

>> (_a_)    shall be liable on conviction to a _fine not exceeding $2,000;_ \[emphasis added\]

> 20H.—(1)    Any person who —

>> (_a_)    keeps or uses a vehicle in Singapore without a vehicle entry permit;

113    The prescribed punishment provision for r 20H(1)(a) of the RT(IC)R is s 131(2) of the RTA. Prior to 20 June 2017, the prescribed punishment for a first offender was a fine not exceeding $1,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 months. Since 20 June 2017, this was amended to include the alternative imposition of both a fine and imprisonment term. The maximum prescribed fine and imprisonment term remain at $1,000 and 3 months respectively.

114    The maximum prescribed fine for s 15(a) of the RTA is higher at $2,000.

115    Unlike what was submitted by the Defence, the usual tariff for these regulatory offences is between $500 to $600 per charge. Having taken into consideration the number of TIC charges, I imposed a fine of $600 in default 2 days’ imprisonment for each of the proceeded charges. The total fine imposed was therefore $4,800 in default 16 days’ imprisonment.

116    In sentencing the accused, I have considered the mitigating factors raised by the Defence, including the fact that he had pleaded guilty and was untraced for similar offences.

117    Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) where I had to order the custodial sentences of at least two offences to run consecutively, I ordered the sentences for MCN-900142-2020 (2nd Charge), LTA-2020-000046-10 (12th Charge) and LTA-2020-000046-7 (9th Charge) to run consecutively. The global imprisonment sentence imposed on the accused was thus nine weeks’ imprisonment.

118    In doing so, I have addressed my mind on the totality principle. I have further bore in mind that s 182 of the PC and s 129(2)(d) of the RTA offences were separate and distinct offences as well as the fact that the accused was found committing the s 129(2)(d) of the RTA offences on at least 11 separate occasions over a period of time.

## Conclusion

119    To summarise, the accused was accordingly sentenced as follows:
