### Principal District Judge Victor Yeo Khee Eng:

## Introduction

The accused, Mr Sanjeevan s/o Maha Lingam, pleaded guilty to five charges, comprising of two charges of using criminal force against a public servant in the execution of their duty under s 353 of the Penal Code 1871 (“**PC 1871**”); one charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to one Mariapan Munniandy under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“**PC (Cap. 224)**”); and two counts of using abusive words against a public servant, both offences being under s 6(1)(a) read with s 6(3) and punishable under s 8(1)(d) of two versions of the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”) – the POHA (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev. Ed) (“**POHA (Cap. 256A)**”) and the **POHA 2014**.

2       Upon his conviction, the Accused admitted and consented to another six charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (the “**TIC Charges**”).

## Statement of Facts

7       The Statement of Facts (the “**SOF**”) – to which the Accused admitted without qualification are as follows:

> 1.    The accused is Sanjeevan s/o Maha Lingam.

> Facts relating to DAC-902849-2022 and MAC-901244-2022

> 2.    On 12th September 2021 at about 11.03am, the Police received a ‘999’ \[call\] reporting a disturbance caused by a drunk at Blk 531A Upper Cross Street, Hong Lim Food Centre and Market, Singapore 051531.

> 3.    In response to the call, Staff Sergeant Chia Chee Pin (“SSG Chia”) and Sergeant Tan Ning Xuan (SGT Tan) were dispatched to the incident location. When they arrived, SSG Chia proceeded to \[engage\] the accused. The accused started to become agitated and started using abusive language towards SSG Chia by saying the words “Fuck you policeman”, “Lan Jiao” and “dog”. The accused was observed to be reeking of alcohol at the time and was holding on to a bottle of beer.

> 4.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused committed an offence under s. 6(1)(a) read with s. 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A, Rev Ed 2015) (“POHA”). As the accused was, on 28 April 2020, convicted of an offence under s. 6(1)(a) read with s. 6(3) and punished under s. 8(1)(d) POHA, he is therefore liable for an enhanced punishment under s. 8(1)(d) POHA.

> 5.    The officers decided to arrest the accused and brought him back to Police Cantonment Complex. They also seized a plastic stool that the accused had allegedly thrown from the second floor. At the Lock-Up, the accused was seated on a bench with his left arm cuffed to it. He held a slipper in his other hand. As Sgt Tan was lodging a seizure report in relation to the plastic stool at the Lock-Up, the accused, with intent to deter Sgt Tan from discharging her duty as a public servant, threw the slipper towards her, hitting her on her left forearm. Sgt Tan did not suffer any injury.

> 6.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence under s. 353 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, Rev Ed 2008) (“Penal Code”).

> Facts relating to DAC-902848-2022

> 7.    The victim is Mariapan Munniandy. He was a cleaner at the material time. On 24 September 2021, after finishing work at about 7 pm, the victim went to sleep on a sofa in the bin centre located at Blk 1 Jalan Kukoh Bin Centre, Singapore.

> 8.    At about 11.15 pm, the victim was woken up by the accused. The accused and the victim then got into a dispute over the victim resting at the bin centre. In the course of the dispute, the accused punched the victim once on his left cheek, with intention to cause grievous hurt to the victim. After punching the victim, the accused left the bin centre.

> 9.    The victim went to see a doctor the next day for jaw pain. An X-ray revealed that the victim suffered a jaw fracture and he was referred to Singapore Dental Centre for surgery. The victim’s medical report stated that he had displaced comminuted fracture of the left mandible adjacent to the angle of the mandible, along with overlying soft tissue swelling, and had undergone an open reduction and internal fixation surgery on 29 September 2021 and was subsequently discharged on 1 October 2021.

> 10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence under s. 325 of the Penal Code.

> Facts relating to DAC-902812-2022 and MAC-902081-2022

> 11.    On 21 February 2022, sometime after 1.19 pm, Sergeant Muhammad Firdaus bin Hussain (“Sgt Firdaus”) and his partner were dispatched in response to a “999” call that reported that a man had been harassing women in the vicinity of Blk 34 Upper Cross Street. The officers conducted a foot-patrol of the area and came across the accused at \[a\] fitness corner at 51 Chin Swee Road and approached him as he fit the description given in the report. Upon checking, the officers found a glass pipe in the accused’s backpack and arrested him.

> 12.    The accused was brought back to Police Cantonment Complex and brought to the Antigen Rapid Test swab waiting area. While waiting for his swab to be taken, the accused refused to comply with directions given by the officers and repeatedly pulled down his facemask.

> 13.    Before the swab test personnel arrived, the accused suddenly stood up, pulled down his facemask and spit on Sgt Firdaus’ face and said to him “Fucking Muslim bastard” and “Fuck Allah”.

> 14.    By reason of the foregoing, the accused had committed the following offences:

>> a.    1 count under s. 353 of the Penal Code 1871; and

>> b.    1 count under s. 6(1)(a) read with s. 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (“POHA 2014”).

> 15.    As the accused was, on 28 April 2020, convicted of an offence under s. 6(1)(a) punished under s. 8(1)(d) POHA, he is liable, for his offence under s. 6(1)(a) read with s. 6(3) POHA 2014, for an enhanced punishment under s. 8(1)(d) POHA 2014.

#### 1st Charge under s 353 Penal Code

11     In relation to the 1st Charge under s 353 of the PC 1871, the Prosecution referred to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Stephen Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 246</span>, in which the court recognised the act of spitting on one’s face as a “_vile and degrading act_” which carries a risk of transmission of disease (at \[29\]). The Prosecution also highlighted that the High Court in _Aw Soy Tee_ had identified cases of spitting as an example of Category 2 cases.

12     Having regard to the above, the Prosecution submitted that the offence disclosed in the 1st Charge fell under Category 2, involving greater harm and lower culpability or lesser harm and higher culpability, for which there was a prescribed sentencing band of “three to eighteen months’ imprisonment”.

13     The Prosecution further highlighted the Accused’s persistent show of defiance of authority over four separate episodes in a single day \[comprising the 1st Charge, the 7th Charge (TIC), the 8th Charge and the 9th Charge (TIC)\] as a culpability-enhancing factor.

14     In light of the above, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

#### 3rd Charge under s 353 Penal Code

15     In relation to the 3rd Charge under section 353 of the PC (Cap. 224) for throwing a slipper at the police officer, the Prosecution submitted that the present case fell under Category 1 of lesser harm and lower culpability, since the victim had not suffered injury or bodily pain. Category 1 of the _Aw Soy Tee_ framework prescribes a sentencing band of “fine or up to three months’ imprisonment”.

16     The Prosecution referred to the same aggravating factor identified above at \[13\] and submitted that a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate.

### 2nd Charge under s 325 Penal Code

17     In relation to the 2nd Charge under s 325 of the PC (Cap. 224), the Prosecution referred to the two-step sentencing approach laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“**_BDB_**”) (at \[55\]):

> “… The primary sentencing objective in such cases is likely to be deterrence. Further, retribution may alos be relevant as a sentencing consideration where heinous violence has been inflicted. In our judgment, we think that sentencing in such cases should be approached in a two-step process as follows:

> First, because the seriousness of the injury caused underscores the inherent mischief targeted by s 325, it is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and can guide the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing.

> Second, after the indicative starting point has been identified, the sentencing judge should consider the necessary adjustment upwards or downwards based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

#### Step 1: Establish starting point based on seriousness of injury

18     In the first step, the Prosecution submitted that the injury suffered by the victim was a serious one, since he had suffered a fracture to the jaw which required surgical intervention. The Prosecution compared the present case to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Fuad Kamroden_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 287</span> (“**_Kamroden_**”).

19     In _Kamroden_, the offender had punched the victim several times on the head, face and stomach, causing the following injuries:

> (a)     Marked swelling and tenderness over his face at the periorbital, zygomatic and maxillary area;

> (b)     Multiple superficial facial abrasions; and

> (c)     Facial fractures involving the anterior, medial and lateral walls of the left maxillary, left medial and lateral pterygoid plates, and medial wall of the right maxillary sinus.

20     As a result of the abovementioned injuries, the victim had to undergo an open reduction and internal fixation surgery in relation to his facial fractures. This was notably the same in the present case, where the victim suffered a displaced comminuted fracture and had undergone an open reduction and internal fixation surgery on 29 September 2021.

21     The indicative starting point identified in _Kamroden_ was two (2) years’ imprisonment after the court considered the injuries suffered by the victim and the precedent cases, including the case of _BDB_.

22     The Prosecution submitted the gravity of the offence in the present case was lower than _Kamroden_ for two reasons: firstly, the injury in the present case – a comminuted fracture of the mandible – was less serious; secondly, the victim in _Kamroden_ had suffered more injuries due to a more sustained assault as compared to a single punch in the present case. The Prosecution therefore proposed a lower starting point of eighteen (18) months’ imprisonment.

#### Step 2: Adjust based on offender’s culpability and presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors

23     In highlighting the Accused’s antecedents as the primary aggravating factor, the Prosecution argued that he was no stranger to violence and had in fact been convicted on similar offences of voluntarily causing hurt and grevious hurt. There was therefore a need for a specific deterrence. At the same time, the Prosecution acknowledged that the Accused had pleaded guilty, which had mitigatory value.

24     The Prosecution submitted that on a balance, an upward adjustment of the starting point was warranted, and sought a sentence of two (2) years’ imprisonment.

### 5th Charge and 8th Charge under s 6(1)(a) POHA

25     The Prosecution submitted that specific deterrence took precedence for the POHA offences, in light of the Accused’s antecedents for similar offences. Given his recalcitrance and repeated defiant conduct towards authority, the Prosecution sought a sentence of four (4) week’s imprisonment for each s 6(1)(a) POHA charge.

26     The Prosecution further submitted for three sentences to run consecutively, namely, the sentences for using criminal force by spitting saliva at the police officer, voluntarily causing grievous hurt charge, and one count of the s 6(1)(a) POHA charge to run consecutively, making a global sentence of two (2) years’, three (3) months’ and four (4) weeks’ imprisonment.

## Mitigation Plea

27     The Accused tendered a handwritten mitigation plea, which stated that he was remorseful and had fully co-operated with the police investigations. He candidly admitted that he suffered from alcohol addiction, which – coupled with his relationship problems – had caused him to commit the present offences. He further informed that he would be seeking professional help and counselling for his alcohol addiction at the National Addictions Management Service at the Institute of Mental Health, and intended to work hard after his release from prison. The Accused also committed to turn over a new leaf by dissociating himself from negative influences and pleaded for a lenient sentence.

## Sentencing Considerations

### 1st Charge and 3rd Charge under s 353 Penal Code

28     I agreed with the Prosecution that the applicable sentencing framework was that laid out in the landmark case of _Aw Soy Tee_.

#### 1st Charge under s 353 Penal Code

29     In relation to the 1st Charge involving the Accused spitting at Sgt Muhammad Firdaus’ face, I agreed with See J’s comments in _Aw Soy Tee_ that spitting in the face of a police officer would be an example of a Category 2 case. While there was no evidence before me that there had been any transmission of diseases or viruses, nevertheless, the act of spitting itself was vile and degrading. Hence, I assessed that there was low-moderate harm.

30     Further considering that the offence was committed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, when personal hygiene was of utmost importance, I found that the Accused’s culpability was high. As revealed in the SOF, the Accused had refused to comply with the directions given by the police officers and repeatedly pulled down his face mask while waiting for his Antigent Rapid Test swab to be taken, and had spit on the Sgt Muhammad Firdaus’ face, clearly with the intent to humiliate and insult him.

31     In consideration of the above and having regard to his guilty plea, I imposed a sentence of three (3) months’ imprisonment for the 1st Charge. It should be noted that the sentence imposed was at the lowest end of the sentencing band of three to eighteen (18) months in Category 2.

#### 3rd Charge under s 353 Penal Code

32     In relation to the 3rd Charge involving the Accused throwing his slipper at Sgt Tan, I agreed with the Prosecution that the offence fell into Category 1 of the _Aw Soy Tee_ framework involving lesser harm and culpability. While the slipper had hit Sgt Tan’s arm, no injury was suffered.

33     For the avoidance of doubt, I did not think the present case was an exceptional one justifying a mere fine. In light of the Accused’s prolonged defiance from the point of his arrest at the Hong Lim Food Centre and Market, to his detention in the Lock-Up at Police Cantonment Complex, I was of the view that his conduct warranted a custodial sentence of six (6) weeks’ imprisonment. It should be noted that the sentence imposed was slightly lower than the sentence of two (2) months’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution, and mid-point of the sentencing band of fine or up to three (3) months’ imprisonment in Category 1.

### 2nd Charge under s 325 Penal Code

34     I next turn to the s 325 charge for which a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment was imposed. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that the applicable sentencing approach was that laid out in the Court of Appeal case of _BDB_.

#### Step 1: Establish starting point based on seriousness of injury

35     As the Prosecution had rightfully pointed out, the grievous hurt caused in the present case was less severe than that in _Kamroden_. The offender in that case had punched his victim several times on the face, head and stomach, and resumed punching the victim on the nose after the victim managed to disengaged himself from the assault. I refer to the injuries documented in the judgment of _Kamroden_ to compare the two cases:[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

> (a)     The victim was admitted in the National University Hospital for a period of 6 days.

> (b)     The extent and nature of the fractures suffered were as follows:

>> (i)        _Le Fort I_ bilateral maxillary fractures, on the right and left side.

>> (ii)       Right: minimally displaced.

>> (iii)       Left: slightly impacted.

>> (iv)       Horizontal fractures through bilateral nasomaxillary and zygomaticomaxillary buttresses.

36     In the present case, the victim had sustained the injury on a vulnerable part of body, namely, on the left cheek of his face. The punch resulted in a jaw fracture, namely, a minimally displaced comminuted fracture of the left mandible, along with overlying soft tissue swelling. According to the medical report of the victim, there was also left facial swelling, accompanied with trismus and severe tenderness, and there was difficulty in mouth opening and closing.

37     After having undergone the operation under General Anaesthesia, the victm was hospitalised for a period of three days. In my asssessment, the injury in the present case, as represented by the nature and extent of the fractures, and the shorter period of hospitalisation, was less serious than that in _Kamroden_.

38     With the foregoing analysis, I was of the view that the indicative starting point should be lower than the two (2) years’ imprisonment in _Kamroden_, and the eighteen (18) months’ imprisonment submitted by the prosecution. In my view, a starting point in the range of thirteen (13) to fourteen (14) months’ imprisonment was appropriate, having regard to the seriousness of the grievous hurt caused.

#### Step 2: Adjust based on offender’s culpability and presence of relevant aggravating and/or mitigating factors

39     Having determined the indicative starting point, I then considered the Accused’s culpability and the presense of aggravating and mitigating factors in adjusting the starting point. I found the following aggravating factors to be relevant:

> (a)     The attack was entirely unprovoked. The victim, who worked as a cleaner at the material time, had been asleep in the bin centre after he finished work, when the Accused woke him up and started the altercation before punching the victim on his left cheek.

> (b)     By the Accused’s own admission, he was intoxicated at the time of the offence, and it is trite law that voluntarily self-intoxication would ordinarily be considered as an aggravating factor: see _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span>.

> (c)     Of concern was the Accused’s antecedents for violent offences. The Accused was heavily traced with violent antecedents, and notably, this was not his first s 325 PC offence. On 28 April 2020, he was sentenced to imprisonment terms of thirteen (13) months and ten (10) months respectively for two convictions under s 325 of the PC (Cap. 224). Furthermore, the Accused, who received a global sentence of 16 months’ and four (4) weeks’ imprisonment for his April 2020 conviction, committed the present s 325 PC offence on 24 September 2021, soon after his release from prison. The principle of escalation therefore applied and warranted a cumulative increase in punishment in order to effect specific deterrence: _Public Prosecutor v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 769</span>.

40     In terms of mitigating factors, other than the Accused’s guilty plea, there was no indication that the Accused had made compensation to the victim or otherwise shown genuine remorse. The Accused’s personal and toxic relationship with his partner should also not be an excuse for his offending behaviour. In my view, the aggravating factors present clearly outweighed the mitigating factors. Having considered the above, I was of the view that an upward adjustment in the range of about four (4) to six (6) months from the starting point would be appropriate.

41     In my judgment, having regard to the predominant sentencing considerations of deterrence and retribution, I was of the view that a sentence of eighteen (18) months’ imprisonment for the 2nd Charge would be an appropriate sentence instead of the two (2) years’ imprisonment term submitted by the Prosecution.

### 5th Charge and 8th Charge under s 6(1)(a) POHA

42     The Accused was traced with a previous conviction under s 6(1)(a) read with s 8(1)(d) of the POHA (Cap. 256A) and was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment in 28 April 2020. In respect of the sentences to impose for these two charges, I agreed with the Prosecution that specific deterrence took centre stage in light of his recalcitrance and repeated defiant conduct towards authority. I therefore imposed a sentence of four (4) weeks’ imprisonment for each charge as proposed by the Prosecution.

## Conclusion

43     In summary, I imposed the sentences as follows:

44     The sentences in DAC-902812-2022, DAC-902848-2022 and MAC-901244-2022 were ordered to run consecutively while the sentences in DAC-902849-2022 and MAC-902081-2022 were ordered to run concurrently. The aggregate sentence imposed was **twenty-one (21) months' and four (4) weeks' imprisonment**. I further ordered that the date of the commencement of sentence be backdated to 2 March 2022, the date that the Accused entered into remand.

45     In ordering three of the imprisonment terms of the distinct and unrelated offences to run consecutively, I was mindful that it did not offend the totality principle, and that it was not a crushing sentence and that it was in keeping with his past record and his future prospects of rehabilitation.

46     Considering that the Accused was last sentenced in April 2020 to sixteen (16) months’ and four (4) weeks’ imprisonment, and re-offended for this series of offences soon after his release from Prisons, I was of the view that the individual and global sentences imposed would be appropriate, notwithstanding that the global sentence imposed was lower than the sentence sought by the Prosecution.

47     The Accused being dissatisfied with the decision had lodged an appeal against his sentence. He is currently serving sentence.
