6 July 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Kevin Kwek:

1       The plaintiff is in the business of providing art education.[^1] It presently operates four physical art schools (each a “Campus”) in Singapore serving around 1,200 students. Its students are predominantly children, with some students as young as two years old.[^2]

2       The second defendant (“Ms Duan”) and the third defendant (“Ms Gou”) were employed by the plaintiff as a Campus head and art teacher respectively until sometime in January 2020. The first defendant was incorporated on 27 May 2019 with Ms Duan as a director and shareholder, and Ms Gou as a shareholder. The first defendant, like the plaintiff, is in the business of providing art education.[^3]

3       According to Ms Duan and Ms Gou, the first defendant only officially began its operations on 1 March 2020, even though it was incorporated on 27 May 2019. On 22 March 2020, a private investigator (“PI”) engaged by the plaintiff visited the first defendant’s art school. The PI’s investigations revealed that all the students in the first defendant’s class schedule and list of students are present or former students of the plaintiff’s.[^4] It is not in dispute that between 1 March 2020 and 22 March 2020, ten of the plaintiff’s students had attended art classes at the first defendant’s art school.[^5]

4       On 15 May 2020, the plaintiff commenced an action against all three defendants for a breach of confidence in unlawfully using the plaintiff’s confidential customer information; and against Ms Duan and Ms Gou, for breach of their employment contracts with the plaintiff. On the same day, the plaintiff applied for an interim injunction against the defendants to restrain the defendants until the final disposal of the trial of the suit, from using, misusing, disclosing, divulging, disseminating and/or otherwise dealing with the plaintiff’s customer contact information and data collected on behalf of the plaintiff’s students and their parents (the “Confidential Customer Information).

5       Having considered the evidence and the submissions before me, I grant the plaintiff’s application for an interim injunction. The reasons for my decision are set out below.

## Background

### The parties

6       The plaintiff was incorporated on 2 June 2015 and began operating various art schools, primarily for children in Singapore in or about March 2019 under the “Tree Art” brand name.

7       According to the plaintiff, Ms Duan was appointed as a Campus Head from March 2019 to January 2020.[^6] Ms Duan on the other hand contends that she was only appointed Campus Head in October 2019 and was employed as an art teacher by the plaintiff from November 2018 to September 2019.[^7] As a Campus head of the plaintiff, part of Ms Duan’s job scope was to assist the plaintiff’s director to manage the day-to-day operations at the Campus as well as to maintain a programme called the enterprise resource planning system (“ERP System”).[^8] According to the plaintiff, a “master list” of the plaintiff’s Confidential Customer Information is stored on this platform.[^9] Ms Duan resigned from the plaintiff’s employ sometime in January 2020.

8       Ms Gou was employed by the plaintiff as an art teacher from March 2019 until her resignation sometime in January 2020.

9       As mentioned above, the first defendant was incorporated by Ms Duan and Ms Gou on 27 May 2019 during their employ with the plaintiff. About two months after resigning from the plaintiff in January 2020, Ms Duan and Ms Gou began conducting art classes for some of the plaintiff’s students at the first defendant’s art school.[^10]

### Summary of the parties’ positions

10     The plaintiff’s application for an interim injunction is based on its claim for breach of confidence against the defendants. According to the plaintiff, Ms Duan and Ms Gou had access and/or were provided with the plaintiff’s Confidential Customer Information in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. The plaintiff further asserts that Ms Duan and Ms Gou were aware that the information was confidential in nature and that in breach of their duties of confidence owed to the plaintiff, Ms Duan and Ms Gou wrongfully retained and used the Confidential Customer Information to “poach and entice” the plaintiff’s students to join the first defendant’s art school.[^11] The plaintiff further submits that the first defendant, through its employees Ms Duan and Ms Gou, is deemed to have knowledge of the Confidential Customer Information and is bound by the same duty of confidence owed by Ms Duan and Ms Gou.

11     It is not in dispute that Ms Duan and Ms Gou had access to the Confidential Customer Information. The defendants however contend that the information was not confidential in nature and that there was no duty of confidence imposed on them.[^12] The defendants submit that even if there was such a duty imposed, the defendants “did not disclose and/or provide access of and/or make copies of, duplicate or reproduce in any form”[^13] the Confidential Customer Information. Further, the defendants deny approaching any of the plaintiff’s students and/or parents and assert that the parents had approached the defendants as they were of the opinion that the first defendant’s teaching methods were “more preferable”[^14] to the plaintiff.

## Issues to be determined

12     It is trite that the law applicable on whether an interim injunction should be granted is set out in _American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1975\] AC 396</span>, namely, whether there is a serious question to be tried followed by whether the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting or refusing the interim injunction sought.

13     Having considered the evidence and submissions, I find that there is a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the interim injunction. I set out my reasons below.

## Issue 1: Serious question to be tried

14     The bar for this enquiry is a low one. The plaintiff need only show that its case is not frivolous and vexatious, such that there is no prospect of succeeding and is bound to fail: _Law and Practice of Injunctions, Interim Measures and Search Orders in Singapore_, Daniel Koh et al, Sweet & Maxwell, 2017 at para 1.062.

15     It should also be stated at the outset that as part of the enquiry on whether there is a serious question to be tried, this court is not making a determination, at this interlocutory stage, on the plaintiff’s rights or whether there has been a violation of it. This must be so since at this juncture, all the court has before it are affidavits of the parties’ witnesses and the evidence has not been tested by way of cross-examination. These are issues that are to be dealt with at trial.

16     As stated by the High Court in _Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pte Ltd v Howden Insurance Brokers (S) Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 258</span> (“_Jardine_”) at \[6\]:

> An interim injunction is a temporary measure to restrain a defendant from doing acts alleged to be in violation of the plaintiff’s legal right. Decisions on whether to grant an interim injunction are made at a time when the plaintiff’s right or the violation of it, or both, is yet to be determined. It is not the court’s duty at this stage of the proceedings to resolve the conflicts of evidence on affidavit pertaining to facts on which the claims of the parties ultimately depend on. Neither is it the court’s duty to decide difficult questions of law which call for detailed argument and mature considerations at this point. They are issues to be dealt with at trial.

17     With the above in mind, I proceed to consider the parties’ positions on the alleged breach of confidence by the defendants.

18     The Court of Appeal recently set out the approach to be taken in breach of confidence claims in _I-Admin (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Hong Ying Ting and others_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 32</span> (“_I-Admin_”) at \[61\]:

> (a)     The information must have the necessary quality of confidence about it.

> (b)     The information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence.

> (c)     Upon the fulfilment of the prerequisites in (a) and (b) above, an action for breach of confidence is presumed, and the burden then shifts to the defendant to displace such a presumption.

19     The three elements are considered below.

### Necessary quality of confidence

20     A plaintiff must particularise the confidential information that it seeks to protect as it is oppressive for it to rely on a general statement that the information is confidential or to delay the giving of particulars until after discovery: _Tang Siew Choy and others v Certact Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 1 SLR(R) 835</span> (“_Tang Siew Choy_”) at \[23\]. In my view, the plaintiff has in this case sufficiently identified the Confidential Customer Information that it seeks to protect i.e. the customer contact information and data collected on behalf of the plaintiff’s students and their parents. The plaintiff essentially seeks to protect its customer list as it considers this one of its most valuable assets.[^15]

21     In this regard, it has been held that customer lists constitute confidential information: _Tang Siew Choy_ at \[30\] to \[32\]; _Mech-Power Generator Pte Ltd v Kang Beng Chiang and others_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] SGHC 99</span> at \[32\]; _Clearlab SG Pte Ltd v Ting Chong Chai and others_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 163</span> (“_Clearlab SG_”) at \[129(i)\] read with \[131\].

22     The evidence of the plaintiff was that its employees frequently use the WeChat application to communicate or exchange work materials with one another, rather than by of electronic mail. According to the plaintiff, this is because “most of the plaintiff’s teachers, students and parents are Chinese nationals and are accustomed to using WeChat as their primary mode of communication”.[^16] However, to protect the confidentiality of the Customer Confidential Information, the plaintiff’s employees are informed that they are not allowed to communicate with the students’ parents directly using the employees’ personal WeChat application accounts unless there are special or urgent circumstances warranting the same.[^17] It was the plaintiff’s evidence that each Campus is equipped with one company mobile telephone through which the plaintiff’s employees are supposed to communicate with the parents.[^18]

23     Further, the plaintiff asserts that the customer list was built up by the plaintiff and not available to the public or shared with anyone outside the plaintiff’s employ.[^19] There is evidence that the plaintiff implemented several safeguards and corporate policies, such as mandatory training to educate their employees in preserving the confidentiality of the Confidential Customer Information.[^20] In particular, the plaintiff highlights that in July 2019, the ERP System, which stores the Confidential Customer Information, was put in place. According to the plaintiff, due to the sensitive nature of the information, access to the system is restricted and only Campus heads can access the contact information of the students and their parents from their respective Campuses.[^21]

24     The plaintiff submits that the first defendant, through its employees Ms Duan and Ms Gou, is deemed to have knowledge of the Confidential Customer Information and the circumstances that it had been obtained and thus be bound by the same duty of confidence of Ms Duan and Ms Gou: _Clearlab SG_ at \[145\].

25     The defendants deny that the information sought to be protected has the necessary quality of confidence. First, the defendants’ position is that the plaintiff’s assertion that the Confidential Customer Information is “not available to the public or shared with anyone outside the Plaintiff’s employ” is untrue. According to the defendants, the plaintiff operates a WeChat application group chat with its existing or potential customers and these individuals are not under the employ of the plaintiff.[^22] Further, the defendants deny that there were stringent protocols implemented by the plaintiff to ensure that the Confidential Customer Information was protected[^23] and no mandatory training was conducted to educate the employees on the importance of keeping the information confidential.[^24]

26     Having considered the parties’ submissions and affidavits, it cannot be said that the plaintiff’s claim that the information sought to be protected has the necessary quality of confidence is bound to fail. In particular, I highlight the following.

> (a)     The plaintiff stresses that the contact information in the WeChat application group chat highlighted by the defendants in \[25\] above is not the same as the Confidential Customer Information stored in the ERP System that the plaintiff seeks to protect.[^25] According to the plaintiff, unlike the Confidential Customer Information, the WeChat application chat group does not reflect the full name of the plaintiff’s students or their parents, or their personal contact numbers.[^26] The plaintiff explains that the users of the application are allowed to go by their usernames; and use online avatars instead of using their full names, contact numbers or picture.[^27]

> (b)     In any event, according to the plaintiff, the members of the WeChat application chat group comprise of former, current and potential customers of the plaintiff who have _voluntarily signed up_ to be included in the group chat to receive news updates and offers from the plaintiff.[^28]

> (c)     Insofar as the defendants’ denial that there were training sessions conducted to stress the importance of keeping the information confidential, the plaintiff has exhibited minutes of a board of directors’ meeting held on 30 July 2019[^29]; an online calendar invite to employees to a meeting to explain the employees’ obligations under the company policies[^30]; and a photograph of a training session conducted by the plaintiff that Ms Duan and Ms Gou had purportedly participated in[^31].

27     Taking the above into consideration, I am satisfied that the evidence raised by both parties in their affidavits raise a conflict that has sufficient plausibility to merit further investigation as to whether the information sought to be protected has the necessary quality of confidence. At this stage, it cannot be said that the plaintiff’s case has no prospect of success and that its case is bound to fail.

### Information imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence

28     Where there is a contract expressly or impliedly imposing an obligation of confidence, this element may be satisfied simply by reference to the contract: _Clearlab SG_ at \[65\].

29     In this respect, the plaintiff’s employment contracts with Ms Duan and Ms Gou (the “Employment Contracts”) contained identical confidentiality clauses, imposing upon them obligations to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Customer Information.[^32] Clause 13.2 of the Employment Contracts defines “confidential information” as follows:

> _From time to time during the course of your employment, you may be given access to confidential information including and not limited to_ sensitive data, trade secrets, business plans, strategies, personnel information, _customer information_, financial information, _data collected on behalf of customers_, internal reports, Company property, keys to premises or any other Company-related property / information that may affect the Company’s competitive position.\[emphasis added\]

30     In addition, clauses 13.3 and 13.4 of the Employment Contracts[^33] provide:

> _…You are not allowed to disclose or provide access of any such confidential information to any third party unless expressly authorised by the Company. You shall also not, without prior written consent of the Company destroy, make copies, duplicate or reproduce in any form the Company’s confidential information._ Failure to look after Company information or property shall result in disciplinary proceedings including dismissal and court proceedings.

> _You are required to observe and uphold all of the Company’s privacy policies and procedures as implemented or varied from time to time._

> \[emphasis added\]

31     The plaintiff’s written company policy applicable to Ms Duan and Ms Gou also states that the customer information is confidential and may not be exported or used privately without the plaintiff’s permission.[^34]

32     In light of the Employment Contracts, company policy and measures implemented by the plaintiff to safeguard the confidentiality of the plaintiff’s customer information, the plaintiff submits that the Confidential Customer Information was imparted to Ms Duan and Ms Gou in circumstances imposing an obligation of confidence.

33     In response, the defendants submit that plaintiff has failed to show that the information was imparted or received in circumstances such as to give rise to an obligation of confidentiality.[^35] The defendants made the following points.

> (a)     Even though the Employment Contracts were dated 1 October 2019, Ms Duan was only provided her Employment Contract on the last day of her employ with the plaintiff (i.e. in January 2020); and Ms Gou sometime in November 2019.[^36]

> (b)     Both Ms Duan and Ms Gou deny having had sight of the company policy on confidential information referred to in \[31\] above.[^37]

> (c)     All teachers, including part-time teachers under the plaintiff’s employ were able to access the ERP System.[^38]

> (d)     Ms Duan and Ms Gou assert that even after the implementation of the ERP System, the plaintiff continued to allow the teachers to have direct communication with the parents using the teachers’ personal WeChat application account rather than to insist on communication via the plaintiff’s account. In support of this point, the defendants exhibited a screenshot of a WeChat application exchange[^39] that took place on 11 October 2019 between Ms Gou and a parent over Ms Gou’s personal WeChat application account. This screenshot was sent to the plaintiff’s director. The defendants assert that the direct communication between Ms Gou and the parent was not viewed by the plaintiff “as an issue”[^40].

34     Having considered the defendants’ objections, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has a reasonable case that the Confidential Customer Information was imparted to Ms Duan and Ms Gou in circumstances imposing an obligation of confidence. I have taken into account the following.

> (a)     It is not disputed that after the implementation of the ERP System, the plaintiff’s employees (including Ms Duan and Ms Gou) were informed that they were not supposed to add new clients’ contact details on their personal WeChat application accounts and that all communication with the parents was to be via the WeChat application group set up by the plaintiff.[^41]

> (b)     Insofar as the WeChat application exchange highlighted in \[33(d)\] above is concerned, the plaintiff’s position is that it had allowed Ms Gou to communicate directly with the student’s grandmother (it is unclear from the evidence whether Ms Gou was communicating with the parent or grandmother of the student) in this instance as the grandmother had raised an issue in relation to the plaintiff’s fees directly with Ms Gou. According to the plaintiff, this was a “special or urgent”[^42] situation that warranted direct contact between parent/grandmother and teacher and does not detract from the plaintiff’s standard protocols and instructions to its teachers that the latter are not allowed to add the parents or relatives of students to their personal WeChat application accounts.[^43]

> (c)     Further, the Employment Contracts, company policy exhibited in evidence and measures implemented by the plaintiff to safeguard the confidentiality of the plaintiff’s customer information suggest that the information was imparted to Ms Duan and Ms Gou in circumstances imposing an obligation of confidence.

35     It is trite that with respect to the prospects of the plaintiff’s success where a dispute as to facts is in issue, it is not appropriate at this interlocutory stage for the court to attempt to resolve conflicts of evidence on affidavit: _Chuan Hong Petrol Station Pte Ltd v Shell Singapore (Pte) Ltd_ \[1992\] 2 SLR 729 at 736 to 737. This will come at trial when parties have had the benefit of all relevant documents being exchanged and witnesses cross-examined. On what is before the court at this juncture, it cannot be said that the plaintiff’s claim that the information was imparted in circumstances giving rise to an obligation of confidence is bound to fail at trial.

### Whether the defendants’ conscience is unaffected

36     The third element of the _I-Admin_ test requires a defendant to show that its conscience was unaffected after a breach of confidence is presumed. This might be displaced where the defendant came across the information by accident or was unaware of its confidential nature or believed there to be a strong public interest in disclosing it. The burden is on the defendant to prove that its conscience was unaffected.

37     In the present case, the defendants stress that _all_ the parents whose children were/are students of the plaintiff and who had subsequently enrolled at the first defendant’s art school had confirmed that the defendants did not entice, solicit or procure them to join the first defendant. According to the defendants, these parents had voluntarily enrolled their children in the first defendant’s classes as they felt that the first defendant was better suited for their children.[^44] Copies of consent forms purportedly signed by the parents were exhibited in the defendants’ joint affidavit.[^45]

38     It is not in dispute that from 1 March 2020 to 22 March 2020, ten of the plaintiff’s students attended art classes at the first defendant’s art school.[^46] Curiously, it was not explained in the defendants’ joint affidavit why only four consent forms were exhibited when _at least_ ten of the plaintiff’s students had attended classes at first defendant’s art school. More crucially, the consent forms are of limited probative value to this court given that they are not dated; the full names of the parents and students are redacted; and the parents’ identities not disclosed. None of the parents have also filed any affidavits on behalf of the defendants.

39     The plaintiff further submits that the defendants’ claim that they did not entice, solicit or procure the parents to enrol their children at the first defendant’s art school was a belated afterthought raised only in the defendants’ joint affidavit of 8 June 2020.

40     In this regard, the plaintiff first alleged that the defendants were poaching the former’s clients by way of its solicitors’ letter of demand dated 26 March 2020.[^47] The defendants’ solicitors’ letter of 30 March 2020 was a substantive five-page reply.[^48] But insofar as the defendants’ response to the plaintiff’s allegation of poaching was concerned, the defendants merely stated that there was “public interest in freedom of employment and encouraging competition” and “\[p\]ost termination of employment, the balance of interest, especially, shifts in the favour of ex-employees to uphold freedom of trade and competition”.[^49] The plaintiff submits that a more “natural response” when faced with an accusation of poaching was to simply deny that the defendants had engaged in acts of poaching and that the parents had enrolled their children at the first defendant’s art school on their own volition. Instead, this denial and the exhibiting of the (undated) consent forms were only belatedly raised two months later in the defendants’ joint affidavit filed on 8 June 2020.

41     To be fair to the defendants, the defendants could well have decided not to set out their position explicitly given that the defendants had indicated in their (albeit lengthy) reply dated 30 March 2020 that the defendants did not intend to engage in litigation by correspondence.[^50] In any event, without the benefit of the evidence of all parties including the parents who had subsequently enrolled their children at the first defendant’s art school, it is an exercise of speculation at this juncture whether the change in art school was due to Ms Duan and Ms Gou’s enticement, or otherwise. This issue can only be determined at trial.

42     Another issue which potentially impinges on the defendants’ conscience is the allegation that after Ms Duan and Ms Gou had resigned, the plaintiff discovered that some of the contacts numbers of the parents in the ERP System had been changed to “dummy” numbers (i.e. “1234567”[^51]) or Ms Duan’s personal contact number, leaving the plaintiff being unable to contact these parents.[^52] The defendants’ explanation appears to be that the dummy numbers were there in the first place and when Ms Duan resigned from the plaintiff’s employ, she had “inadvertently forgotten to obtain the parents’ mobile number for the purposes of uploading the same into the ERP System”[^53]. This however does not quite explain why the contact details of one of the parents was changed to Ms Duan’s private mobile telephone number.[^54]

43     Taking all of the above into consideration, I find that there is sufficient plausibility that impinges on the defendants’ conscience which warrants a further enquiry into the matter.

### Issue 1 conclusion

44     In light of the above, I find that there is a serious question to be tried on whether the defendants have breached their obligations not to disclose the Confidential Customer Information belonging to the plaintiff. This simply means that the plaintiff’s claim cannot be said to be frivolous or vexatious to such an extent that there is no prospect of succeeding at trial.

## Issue 2: The balance of convenience

45     In order to succeed in its application for an interim injunction, the plaintiff will also have to show that the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the injunction.

46     Having consider the evidence and parties’ submissions, I agree with the plaintiff that it would suffer irreparable harm and damages would be an inadequate remedy if the defendants are not restrained by an injunction. Conversely, there is no prejudice to the defendants if the injunction is wrongly granted.

### Damages an inadequate remedy if the defendants are not restrained by the injunction

47     If the defendants are allowed to use the plaintiff’s Confidential Customer Information to “entice and poach” the parents to sign up with the first defendant’s art school, the plaintiff submits that it stands to lose not just the revenue it is currently receiving from these students but also “potential “downstream revenue” that it could have made – whether from these students progressively moving on to the different tiers of the plaintiff’s classes; signing up for different classes across different mediums (e.g. sketching, oil painting, water colouring); or from other referrals which may have come from the parents of these students. The plaintiff submits that these lost opportunities cannot be quantified and will damage the plaintiff irreparably.

48     I agree with counsel for the defendant, Ms Marissa Tan, that any loss of revenue or “potential downstream revenue” is likely to be quantifiable by way of a monetary award in damages. This may require calling parents whose children have switched from the plaintiff to the first defendant’s art school as witnesses to give evidence at trial. It may also entail engaging a financial advisor to calculate and project the potential loss of revenue. Any _difficulty_ in quantifying the damages in itself, however, does not make it inadequate. As it was explained in _Jardine_ at \[11\]:

> An interim injunction may be necessary only if damages will not be adequate. On this point, parties sometimes argue that damages are not adequate when they mean that damages will be difficult to quantify; but the two are not the same. In many instances in which general damages are concerned, there are not that many ways that one can determine what a correct or just amount that is as fair as possible. What the court would do is try and determine an amount that is as fair as possible. And in considering fairness, the court will cast a natural and instinctive glance from the opposing party’s position so as to have a clearer and better view of the merits of the interim injunction sought.

49     While I agree that the potential loss of revenue is quantifiable (albeit, perhaps with some difficulty), I am nonetheless of the view that the plaintiff may face other irreparable harm which cannot be compensated by damages if the injunction were not granted. Specifically, I agree with the plaintiff that the plaintiff’s loss of reputation and goodwill resulting from the disclosure of the Confidential Customer Information by the defendants will cause the plaintiff irreparable harm.

50     It was held in _Advantest Corporate Office (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another v SL Link Co Link (also known as Solar Link Co Ltd) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 75</span> at \[44\] that a plaintiff’s loss of customers’ goodwill and confidence will not be compensable by an award of damages. It was also held in _Erco Lighting Pte Ltd v Tan Soon Khoon (Thomas Tan) and another_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 131</span> at \[29\] that the loss of trade connections and goodwill may lead to the plaintiff being inadequately compensated or uncompensated.

51     Moving to the facts of this case, I agree with counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Natalie Huang, that if the plaintiff’s customers are to learn that their identities and contact details have been disclosed to third parties, including the details of their children, some of whom are as young as two years old, the damage to the plaintiff’s reputation and the loss of their customers’ trust in them would be irreparable.

52     It was highlighted by the plaintiff that protecting the data and privacy of the plaintiff’s parents/students is essential to the latter’s trust in the plaintiff. Ms Huang stressed that an organisation like the plaintiff’s art school depends upon the trust of its existing customers and if such trust was lost, it could have a significant negative impact on the plaintiff. The loss of reputation and goodwill would be particularly felt by the plaintiff whose business relies heavily on the “word of mouth” referrals from parents of existing students to parents of potential new students to grow its student pool.[^55]

53     Further, the plaintiff may be at risk of potential claims from its customers in relation to the plaintiff’s duty of confidentiality to them. The danger of irreparable harm is exacerbated by the fact the Confidential Customer Information was transmitted to the defendants in soft copy format and can be reproduced and disseminated to third parties almost instantaneously through electronic means.[^56]

### There is no prejudice to the defendants if the injunction is wrongly granted

54     Conversely, I am of the view there is no prejudice to the defendants if it is later found that the injunction was wrongly granted. The plaintiff has provided an undertaking that if the court later finds that the granting of the interim injunction has caused loss to the defendants, and decides that the defendants should be compensated for that loss, the plaintiff shall comply with any order that the court may make. [^57]

55     The defendants submit that the effect of the injunction is to prevent _any_ of the plaintiff’s former and/or existing students to be enrolled in the first defendant’s classes even though it is evident that the plaintiff’s customers were the ones who reached out to the first defendant in the first place.[^58] With respect, this is not the effect of the interim injunction granted.

56     Ms Huang readily accepted during the hearing on 23 June 2020 that there will be no breach of the interim injunction if the students of the plaintiff subsequently joined the first defendant’s art school on their own volition without any enticement from the defendants. This must be the case. The injunction does not limit competition, nor is it a restraint of trade. Parents and their children continue to have the right to decide where they wish to have their art classes: (i) at the plaintiff’s art school; (ii) at the first defendant’s art school; (ii) at _both_ schools (this is the case for at least three students[^59]); or (iv) to cease enrolment at the plaintiff and/or first defendant’s art schools.

57     The interim injunction granted does not, and should not, limit, inhibit, prohibit or disrupt any honest and legitimate business that the defendants may wish to carry out. It merely restrains the defendants from misusing the plaintiff’s Confidential Customer Information.

58     The defendants submit that if an interim injunction is granted, the plaintiff may subsequently allege that the defendants are still misusing the plaintiff’s Confidential Customer Information and may commence contempt proceedings against the defendants.[^60] In my view, this is speculative. In order to succeed in contempt proceedings, _the onus is on the plaintiff_ to show that the defendants had breached the interim injunction order and enticed the parents to enrol their children at the first defendant’s art school. To reiterate the point made in \[56\] above, there is no breach of the interim injunction if students of the plaintiff subsequently joined the first defendant’s art school on their own volition.

59     The defendants also submit that the plaintiff’s delay in taking out the injunction application is fatal to the grant of the application. I disagree. On the defendants’ own account, operations at the first defendant’s art school only began in March 2020. The plaintiff discovered that some of its students had enrolled at first defendant’s art school sometime in end March 2020. The injunction application was filed less than two months after, on 15 May 2020. I accept that the intervening time was required for the plaintiff to conduct further investigations, amass the relevant evidence and to instruct its solicitors and translate the numerous documents that were in Mandarin. In addition, taking into account the circumstances triggered by the COVID-19 circuit breaker period, I find that there was no delay in the application.

### Issue 2 conclusion

60     Taking the above into consideration, I find that the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting the interim injunction.

## Conclusion

61     For the reasons above, on the undertaking by the plaintiff that it shall comply with any order the court may make as to damages in case the court should hereafter be of the opinion that the defendants shall have sustained any by reason of this order which the plaintiff ought to pay:

> (a)     an interim injunction is granted to restrain the defendants whether directly or indirectly or by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants or agents (as the case may be) from doing the following until the final disposal of the hearing of the trial (including any appeals thereto):

>> (i)       using, misusing, disclosing, divulging, disseminating and/or otherwise dealing with Confidential Customer Information and/or any part thereof;

>> (ii)       directing, causing, procuring, instigating, enabling or assisting others to do any of the aforesaid acts;

> (b)     that within 14 days of this order, the defendants each disclose to the plaintiff by way of an affidavit all usage of the Confidential Customer Information and the identities of any third parties to whom the said information had been transmitted and/or disseminated to.

62     Lastly, I thank counsel for their submissions which were of much assistance to the court.

63     I will hear parties on costs.
