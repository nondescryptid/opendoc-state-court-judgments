### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a student at the National University of Singapore and resident at one of the university’s residential halls on two separate occasions entered a common female toilet (the female toilet) located in the residential hall in order to photograph women who were using the toilet.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to two charges under s 509 of the Penal Code (PC). I sentenced the Accused to seven weeks’ imprisonment for each charge and ordered that both sentences were to run concurrently. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed. He is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

## Charges

3       The details of the two charges are as follows:

> **MAC 910837 of 2019**

> You, Ryan You Jun Chao, are charged that you, on 14 February 2019 between 7.10 am and 7.22 am, at the common female toilet located at level 9 of \[residential hall\], University Town, National University of Singapore, 18 College Avenue East, Singapore, intending to insult the modesty of one ABC (F/23 years old), did intrude upon her privacy, _to wit_, by using your Oppo mobile phone to take photographs of the said ABC while she was showering, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **MAC 910839 of 2019**

> You, Ryan You Jun Chao, are charged that you, on 5 March 2019 between 1.45 am and 2.00 am, at the common female toilet located at level 9 of \[residential hall\], University Town, National University of Singapore, 18 College Avenue East, Singapore, intending to insult the modesty of one XYZ (F/23 years old), did intrude upon her privacy, _to wit_, by using your Oppo mobile phone to take photographs of the said XYZ while she was showering, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Facts

4       The Accused is Ryan You Jun Chao, a 25-year-old male Singaporean. The Accused and the victims ABC and XYZ were residents at an NUS residential hall and their rooms were located on the same level of the residential hall.

### Facts pertaining to MAC 901837 of 2019

5       On 14 February, at some time before 7.10 a.m., the Accused awoke and was tempted to check and see if there were any women showering in the female toilet. He walked over the female toilet, observed that the door was held open by a stopper and heard showering sounds from inside the female toilet. The Accused entered the female toilet and noticed that someone was using the first cubicle. He then took out his Oppo mobile phone (mobile phone), switched it to camera mode, held it over the cubicle partition and took photographs of the ABC as she showered.

6       Whilst the Accused was taking photographs, ABC noticed a shadow outside her cubicle. She then looked up and spotted the mobile phone held above the cubicle partition. ABC shouted and pushed the mobile phone away. The Accused panicked and fled out of the female toilet and went to the male toilet. ABC reported that she felt uncomfortable as a result. The photographs of ABC recovered from the Accused’s mobile phone showed that she was fully nude.

### Facts pertaining to MAC 910839 of 2019

7       Approximately two to three weeks after the incident, on 5 March, in the early hours of the morning, as Accused was walking along the hallway to his room he was again tempted to check to see if there were any women showering in the female toilet. He then walked to the female toilet and observed that the door of the toilet was held open by a stopper. Hearing showering sounds from within the female toilet, the Accused entered and saw that someone was using the first cubicle.

8       The Accused then took out his mobile phone, switched it to camera mode, held it over the partition and took photographs of XYZ showering. The Accused then left the female toilet and went to the pantry to check the photographs. Having done this, the Accused returned to his room.

9       During her shower, XYZ had noticed a shadow outside her cubicle and had seen part of the Accused’s hair above the cubicle door. XYZ stopped her shower, wrapped herself in a towel and waited for other women to enter the female toilet before she felt it was safe enough for her to continue her shower. After leaving the female toilet, she noticed the Accused at the pantry. XYZ reported that she felt uncomfortable and unsafe and that, since the incident, she avoided using the female toilet. The photographs of XYZ recovered from the Accused’s mobile phone showed that she was fully nude.

### Other facts

10     The Accused admitted that he had committed the offences described above and that he had deleted the photographs prior to surrendering his phone to the police for investigations. It would appear that the police managed to recover the photographs of ABC and XYZ and this showed that the Accused had photographed both victims whilst they were nude.

## Charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing

11     The Accused admitted to and consented to two charges of criminal trespass under section 447 of the PC being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Issues to be determined

12     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     Whether a Community Based Sentencing (CBS) order or combination of orders was appropriate; and

> (b)     If CBS was not appropriate, then on the facts and circumstances of the case, whether the Court should impose a fine rather than a custodial sentence.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

13     S 509 is punishable with a fine not exceeding $20,000 or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both.

### Antecedents

14     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

15     The Prosecution sought a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment for each charge and for the sentences to run concurrently.

#### Appropriateness of CBS options

16     In oral submissions, the Prosecution objected to the calling of a pre-sentence report for CBS. The Prosecution submitted that in _GCX v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1325</span>, See J held, at \[32\] and \[33\], CBS options were introduced to give the courts more tools to respond to the sentencing principle of rehabilitation and if an offender possessed no rehabilitative potential then a CBS would be ineffective and inappropriate. The inquiry into whether the Accused possessed rehabilitative potential should “not take place in a vacuum, with a single-minded focus only on \[the Accused’s\] prospects for rehabilitation, ignoring the presence of other sentencing principles”. Therefore, the Prosecution submitted, that there needed to be a balancing of the principles of deterrence, retribution, prevention and rehabilitation.

17     The Prosecution submitted that the facts of the case demonstrated that deterrence was the key sentencing consideration. The Prosecution pointed to the fact that the Accused was 24-years old at the time of the offence and was not a young offender. The Prosecution argued that Accused had brazenly trespassed into the female toilet on two occasions to commit the offences. He had demonstrated voyeuristic ways and a disregard for the modesty and privacy of his victims. The Prosecution submitted that the fact that the Accused had attempted to delete the photographs should evinced an intention to destroy the evidence.

18     Referring to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report tendered by the Defence[^1], the Prosecution submitted that there was no proven causal link between the Accused’s diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder and the offences. The Prosecution submitted that I should give no weight to the report.

19     The Prosecution submitted, on the authority of _Stansilas Fabian Kester v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span>, that I should not give any mitigating weight to the submission that a custodial sentence would likely have a deleterious effect on the Accused’s future prospects.

20     The Prosecution submitted that even if the Accused had the propensity for reform this was clearly eclipsed by the need for general and specific deterrence. The Prosecution submitted that there was an increasing number of voyeurism offences being committed especially on university campuses. The Accused had used a recording device to commit the offences and on the authority of _Public Prosecutor v Chong How En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span> the Prosecution submitted that on this fact the principle of general deterrence applied.

#### Submission on sentence

21     In addition, to the aggravating factors referred to above, the Prosecution submitted that the degree of intrusion was high, as the Accused had photographed the victims when they were fully nude. The Prosecution emphasised that it was an aggravating factor that the Accused deleted the photographs.

22     The Prosecution referred to its table of sentencing precedents as a guide to the sentences imposed on Accused charged with similar s 509 offences. The Prosecution argued that I should not draw a distinction between offenders who photographed their victims and offenders who filmed their victims as both types of recording required the use of recording devices. The Prosecution submitted that the case precedents relied upon by the Defence, in particular _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Yee Chun Wei_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 15</span> were distinguishable.

### Mitigation

#### Circumstances of the offences

23     The Defence portrayed the Accused’s offending conduct as a momentary lapse of judgment. The Defence submitted that there was no planning or premeditation on the part of the Accused and instead that the Accused had acted impulsively and had given in to a sudden urge to look at the victims in the female toilet.

#### Mitigating factors

24     The Defence submitted that the Accused was ashamed of his actions and that he was genuinely remorseful and contrite. The Accused had sought to apologise to the two victims and to this end, he had drafted letters of apology that he hoped the victims would receive. However, he was unable to send the letters to the victims as the Court had, as part of the bail conditions, prohibited the Accused from contacting them. Instead, the Defence sent the letters to AGC with the hope that AGC would forward them to the victims. AGC informed the Defence that it was not in a position to deliver the apology letters to the victims.

25     The Accused claimed that he had been depressed for many years and the National University Polyclinics had referred him to IMH for evaluation. Dr Poornima Gangaram (Dr Gangaram) had diagnosed the Accused to have Adjustment Disorder with mood symptoms. The Accused also claimed that a teacher had sexually abused him when he was 12. The Accused’s girlfriend, Ms Ong Shu Qing, supported this claim.

26     Prior to the offences, the Accused was unaware that he had a problem but after these incidents, he realised that he did and has since been actively seeking treatment. The Accused stated that he had attended six psychiatric sessions with Dr Gangaram and that he intended to continue the sessions and increase the frequency of the sessions. The Accused had also attended regular counselling sessions at the Counselling and Care Centre. He had attended around 20 sessions with the last session being shortly before he pleaded guilty. The Defence submitted that the Accused had taken active steps to improve his condition and that he was on the road to recovery. The Defence submitted that the stress of a custodial sentence would unravel the progress he had made.

27     The Defence submitted that the Accused’s family provided him with close and strong support. The Accused’s parents were determined to be personally involved in the Accused’s recovery to ensure that he did not stray in future.

28     The Defence also submitted that the Accused had been punished by NUS as he had been suspended from NUS for a semester, had lost his Kent Ridge Undergraduate Scholarship and had to serve 60 hours of community service. The Accused has had stellar academic results and, the Defence submitted, has a bright future. The Defence urged the Court not to impose a custodial sentence, as this would have a deleterious effect on his future.

29     The Defence tendered a number of testimonials attesting to the Accused’s good character. The Defence pointed out that the Accused had no previous convictions and that the current offences were “borne out of a lapse of judgment”. The Defence stated that there was a very low chance that the Accused would reoffend. Finally, the Defence submitted that the Accused had cooperated fully with the investigations and that he had pleaded guilty at an early stage.

#### Imposition of a CBS option

30     The Defence submitted that in light of the strong mitigating factors, the fact that the Accused was on the route to rehabilitation, his young age, bright future, low chance of re-offending and strong familial support the primary sentencing consideration should be rehabilitation and this would call for the imposition of a CBS option.

31     In the written Plea in Mitigation, the Defence did not indicate the CBS orders that they sought. However, in oral submissions the Defence appeared to submit that a combination of a Short Detention Order (SDO) and a Community Service Order (CSO) would be an appropriate sentence.

32     The Defence referred to a number of precedents to support the submission that CBS was the appropriate sentence; in particular, they referred to _Public Prosecutor v Hoon Oi Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 5</span> and a newspaper article regarding an 18 year-old who was sentenced for an offence under s 509 to a 14-day SDO. The Defence submitted that the present case shared similarities with _Hoon Oi Tong._

#### Imposition of a fine

33     In the alternative, the Defence submitted that I should sentence the Accused to pay a fine of $2,000. The Defence submitted that in _GCO_, See J had found that where there was no planning and premeditation a fine would be an appropriate sentence for a s 509 offence. The Defence also submitted that the case of _Yee Chun Wei_ supported their contention that I should impose a fine.

#### Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents

34     The Defence distinguished the Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents primarily as the cases referred to have additional aggravating factors that the Defence claimed were absent in the present case. Similarly, the Defence contended that the circumstances in _Chong Hou En_ were far more egregious and, as such, that I should sentence the Accused to a far lesser sentence.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

35     The relevant legislative provision of the PC is as follows:

> **509**.    Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine or with both.

36     The relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed (CPC) (with respect to the CSO and SDO) are as follows:

> **337.** – (1)    Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a court shall not exercise any of its powers under this Part to make any community order in respect of –

>>> (iii)   at least once to an approved institution, and at least once to an approved centre;

>> (_ga_)   an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations (Cap. 185, Rg 1) or the Intoxicating Substances Act, if the offender had previously been admitted to an approved institution or an approved centre;

>> (_i_)    an offence which is punishable with a term of imprisonment which exceeds 3 years.

>>> imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the commission of the offence;

> **346.** – (1)    Subject to subsection (2), where an offender who is 16 years of age or above is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to his reformation that he makes amends to the community for the offence by performing such work as is specified in the Fifth Schedule, the court may make a community service order requiring him to perform any unpaid community service under the supervision of a community service officer.

> (2)    A court shall not make a community service order in respect of an offender unless the court is satisfied that —

>> (a)    based on the mental and physical condition of the offender, he is a suitable person to perform community service under such an order; and

>> (b)    suitable arrangements can be made for him to perform community service under such order.

> (3)    A court must, before making a community service order, call for a report from a community service officer regarding the suitability of an offender to perform community service under that order.

> **348.** – (1)    Where an offender who is 16 years of age or above is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the Court may make a short detention order requiring him to be detained in prison for a period which shall not exceed 14 days.

#### Sentencing considerations for s 509 offences

37     In _Public Prosecutor v Tay Beng Guan Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 778</span> (_Albert Tay_), the respondent had recorded, using a video camcorder, films of the victim undressing and using the toilet. Yong CJ held that s 509 offences, where the Accused had recorded the victim in her private moments, unlike other “peeping tom cases”, allowed the Accused the potential to view repeatedly the recordings for his own perverted pleasure: _Albert Tay_ at \[22\]. Yong CJ held that as video camcorders were freely available and in light of policy considerations, there was a need for the Courts to impose deterrent sentences to indicate to the public that offences of this sort would not be tolerated: _Albert Tay_ at \[23\].

38     In _Chong Hou En_, Chan J held at \[65\]:

> … I am in agreement that **general deterrence is particularly relevant**. Given the fact that mobile phones with camera functions are not ubiquitous and that cameras with recording functions come in all shapes, sizes and disguises and are getting cheaper to acquire, the perverse now find it easier to prey on unsuspecting women almost anywhere. **… the need for general deterrence is even more pressing now than during the time that Albert Tay was decided, given how far technology has advanced**. … In addition, the **ease with which videos can be uploaded onto the Internet for dissemination in this day and age further warrants the need for general deterrence**. Unimaginable shame and distress to the victim may be caused if the videos are disseminated to worldwide via the Internet. Although in this case no videos were uploaded and disseminated, the danger, which is not fanciful but very real, that it could have happened is sufficient to warrant a deterrent sentence. I am in full agreement that a strong message should be sent to those who harbour thoughts of abusing these advancements in technology.

\[ **Emphasis mine**\]

39     Chan J held that aggravating factors included: (i) a high degree of intrusion (for instance where the victims were recorded fully naked); (ii) where there were multiple victims; (iii) if the victims were young; (iv) where video recording technology was used; and (v) where there was a high degree of planning and premeditation: _Chong Hou En_ at \[68\] referring to \[14\].

40     However, Chan J was loath to establish a custodial benchmark for all s 509 offences involving the use of technology and he held, at \[77\]:

> I am of the opinion that establishing a custodial benchmark along such lines may not be appropriate given the myriad ways that offences under s 509 of the Penal Code may be committed with a recording device. _Albert Tay_ involved planning and premeditation. Both _Albert Tay_ and _Liton_ had a high degree of intrusion into the privacy of the victim. **While I am generally in agreement that a custodial sentence is warranted where the aggravating factors such as multiple victims or young victims or the aggravating factors in** **_Albert Tay_** **or** **_Liton_** **are present**, I would be chary in concluding that a custodial sentence should be the starting point the moment a recording device is used. While I note that the use of a recording device allows the repeated viewing of the victim’s private moments, all other factors should be considered before the final sentence is calibrated. Therefore, **where there is no planning or premeditation and the intrusion upon the privacy is not as grave as in** **_Albert Tay_** **and** **_Liton_****, and where multiple victims or young victims are not involved, such as in** **_Tan Huat Heng_****, a custodial sentence may not be warranted.**

\[ **Emphasis mine**\]

41     Therefore, I found that general deterrence has been the primary sentencing consideration for s 509 offences where the Accused has used a recording device since _Albert Tay_. The need for deterrent sentences has increased with the advancements in technology since _Albert Tay_.

42     I accept, on the authority of _Chong Hou En_, that the need for a deterrent sentence for offences involving the use of a recording device does not automatically translate into a custodial sentence. However, if there are aggravating factors, and more so a combination of aggravating factors, in addition to the use of a recording device then a custodial sentence is more appropriate. In fact, I found, on the authority of _Chong Hou En_, that the use of a recording device in combination with **one** other aggravating factor, such as planning and premeditation, a high level of intrusion or multiple or young victims would justify the imposition of a custodial sentence.

43     I found that in the present case, there were a combination of aggravating factors and, as such, I found that a custodial sentence would be warranted in order to achieve the objective of general deterrence.

#### Aggravating factors

44     I found that there were multiple aggravating factors. First, the Accused had used a recording device to commit the offences. This is aggravating for two reasons, first, as it allows the Accused to opportunity to view the recordings repeatedly and, second, it allows for the potential for further dissemination.

45     The Accused claimed that he had deleted the photographs that he had taken of XYZ whilst he was he was in the pantry just after he had committed the offence. He claimed that he deleted the photographs because he was ashamed of his actions. Whilst there is no evidence to the contrary, I nonetheless did not consider this to be mitigating. The Accused admitted, in the Statement of Facts (SOF), that he had gone to the pantry to “check on the photographs” before he returned to his room, there was no indication that he deleted the images immediately. Had the Accused been so consumed with guilt such that he deleted the images immediately it would make sense that he would have informed the police about this when he was investigated for these offences. The fact that this was not in the SOF suggests that he did not delete the images immediately.

46     In any case, I noted that there was no claim by the Accused that he deleted the images that he took of ABC immediately after he had photographed her. Therefore, with regard to the photographs of ABC, I found that I could infer that the Accused kept them and he had the opportunity to view the photographs repeatedly.

47     In addition, the potential for further dissemination of the photographs, at the very least ABC’s photographs, also existed. I accept that the Accused did not disseminate the photographs, however, the fact that there was no actual dissemination was not a mitigating factor it was merely the absence of a more aggravating factor.

48     Second, there was clearly a high degree of intrusion. Both victims were having showers when the Accused photographed them. The photographs that were recovered from the Accused’s mobile device showed that the Accused had photographed both victims when they were fully nude.

49     The Defence submitted that the present case was less egregious than some of the precedent cases because the Accused had photographed the victims rather than filmed them. I agreed with the Prosecution submission that there was no material difference between the modes of recording, instead what was relevant was the content of the recording. A film recording of a victim who was showering that was unable to capture her fully nude would be, in my opinion, less intrusive when compared to a photograph that did capture the victim fully nude.

50     Third, there were multiple victims in this case. I accept that the number of victims in this case is not as high as the number in other precedent cases. However, the fact that there was more than one victim precludes a submission that the Accused’s offending conduct was a one-off aberration.

51     I found that as these three aggravating factors were present a custodial sentence was warranted and should be imposed in order to meet the needs of general deterrence.

52     I also found that there were additional aggravating factors existed that I had to consider. I accepted that there was no premeditation in the sense, for instance, that the Accused had deliberately targeted his victim and then followed her into the female toilet to photograph her. I also accepted that the Accused had not used any sophisticated methods to commit the offences, for instance using pin-hole or disguised cameras. However, I nonetheless found that there was an element of planning in that the Accused was quite clearly goal-oriented.

53     The Defence has attempted to characterise the Accused’s offending conduct as a spontaneous lapse of judgment and that he was opportunistic. The Defence claimed that the Accused was opportunistic because, on both occasions, he just happened to be walking past the female toilet when he noticed that the door was ajar and he heard the sound of showering within. He then gave into his baser instincts, entered the female toilet and committed the offences. At paragraph \[49\] of the plea in mitigation, the Defence submitted, “Ryan had only acted in the way that he did due to his momentar\[y\] lapse in judgment. He did not harbour any heinous intention and had only entered the toilet as he was near the toilet”.

54     I found, with respect, that this characterisation of the Accused was inaccurate. As stated above, I found that the Accused was goal-oriented in his offending conduct. With regard to the offence on 14 February, the SOF stated that the Accused had woken up and “felt tempted to check and see if there was any woman showering in the common female toilet”. After waking up the Accused clearly had a plan to see if he could photograph women showering. This was far from the Accused happening by the female toilet and then being seized by the sudden urge to enter because he heard the sounds of showering and realised that it must have been a woman.

55     Similarly, with regard to the offence on 5 March, the Accused was tempted to check if there were women showering in the female toilet **before** he had passed by the female toilet. This was apparent because the SOF states that he “then walked to the common female toilet”. Once again, the Accused was goal-oriented and had a plan.

56     I also considered the effect that these offences had on the victims. In the present case the Accused’s offending conduct, understandably, made the victims feel uncomfortable. In particular, with regard to XYZ, the Accused’s offending conduct has had a more lasting effect as she felt both uncomfortable and unsafe and she now avoids using the female toilet because of the Accused’s actions. I found that this was an aggravating factor.

57     In addition, the Accused committed the offences in a place where the victims had a right to expect to be safe and secure. The toilet in question was a female-only toilet and the victims must not have expected that the Accused would enter the female toilet to commit the offences. I found that this was an aggravating factor.

58     Based on the aggravating factors detailed above I found that a custodial sentence was warranted.

#### Mitigating factors

##### (1)   Remorse, cooperation and crime-free record

59     The Defence submitted that the Accused regretted committing the offences and was remorseful. The Accused had indicated his intention to plead guilty at a very early stage and I accepted that this was an expression of his remorse. It would appear to me that the Accused sincerely wished to apologise to the victims. However, I would not fault the Prosecution for not passing the Accused’s letters of apology to the victims. The incidents had clearly traumatised the victims and there was nothing to be gained in making them re-live the incidents. Nonetheless, I accepted that the Accused’s early plea of guilt and his desire to apologise to the victims was indicative of his sense of remorse. I also accepted that the Accused was ashamed and regretted his actions.

60     I accepted that the Accused had fully cooperated with the authorities. I did not accept the Prosecution’s submission that the Accused’s deletion of the photographs evinced an intention to destroy the evidence. The Accused claimed that he had deleted the photographs before he was investigated for the offences and I accepted this claim.

61     This is the Accused’s first brush with the law and I accepted that this was a mitigating factor.

62     However, I found that in view of the aggravating factors present these mitigating factors would be insufficient to justify the imposition of a non-custodial sentence.

##### (2)   The Accused’s psychiatric condition

63     The Accused claimed that he was suffering from a depressed mood and that he was the victim of sexual abuse. I noted that Accused went to the National University Polyclinics on 28 March 2019. It would appear that this was the first time that he confided in medical professionals that he had suffered from a depressed mood and that this was the first time that the Accused admitted that he had been sexually abused.

64     This visit was **after** the Accused had committed the offences and after the victims had made their police reports. Had the Accused been truly depressed then he should have sought help earlier, at the very least after the offence on 14 February when he must have realised that his depressed mood may have had an effect on his offending behaviour. The fact that he did not seek help earlier casts some doubt over the Accused’s claim that he had a depressed mood.

65     The Accused was referred to IMH and he informed to Dr Gangaram that he had mood symptoms secondary to an ongoing disciplinary investigation by NUS. According to Dr Gangaram’s report, NUS’ disciplinary investigation brought on the Accused’s mood symptoms. There was no reference in the report to the Accused having a depressed mood for a number of years. More pertinently, Dr Gangaram diagnosed the Accused as having an Adjustment Disorder but there was no mention in the report that the Adjustment disorder predated the offences or that it had any causal or contributory link to the commission of the offences.

66     It would appear to me that, after he was caught for the offences, the Accused had developed mood symptoms and anxiety over the consequences of the NUS disciplinary investigation and, possibly, the impending criminal prosecution. However, these conditions had no bearing on the commission of the offences and I found that these conditions were not mitigating because there was no evidence that they existed prior to the offences. There was also very little detail about the extent of his conditions and the effect that they had on the Accused at present. Therefore, there was very little basis to treat these conditions as a mitigating factor.

67     The Accused claimed that he had been sexually abused as a child and, if this is so, then this would be tragic and he would have my sympathies. However, just as with the Accused’s Adjustment Disorder there was just no objective evidence to substantiate the Accused’s claim and the Defence did not present any evidence to show how the sexual abuse was connected to the Accused’s offending conduct. Therefore, I ascribed little mitigating weight to these claims.

##### (3)   The Accused’s post-offence treatment

68     The Accused informed that he had attended six psychiatric treatment sessions with Dr Gangaram and had attended over 20 counselling sessions at the Counselling and Care Centre. This was certainly commendable; however, I was at a loss as to how the psychiatric treatment sessions or counselling sessions had any bearing on my consideration of the appropriate sentence. The Accused did not tender any reports from either Dr Gangaram or the Counselling and Care Centre to explain what he was being treated for and the efficacy of that treatment.

69     I would assume that the treatment and counselling were related to the Accused’s Adjustment Disorder and to his claim that he was sexually abused as a child but in the absence of any link to the offending conduct I found that this was not in any way mitigating. The lack of detail with regard to his conditions or his treatment meant that I could not consider this in determining whether rehabilitation had come to the fore as a sentencing consideration.

70     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the Defence had not provided any evidence to substantiate its claim that a custodial sentence would have a detrimental effect on his mental health or affect his treatment progress.

##### (4)   The impact of a conviction on the Accused’s future.

71     In _Stanislas Fabian Kester_, Menon CJ considered the impact that a conviction and punishment would have on an offender’s future and he held, at \[110\] to \[111\]:

> The second argument is that an offender should not receive punishment of a certain type or above a certain degree because he will lose his job or face disciplinary proceedings otherwise. The argument is that the imposition of a certain type or degree of punishment will lead to hardship or compromise the offender’s future in some way and that this additional hardship may and indeed should be taken into account by the sentencing court. However, this will not often bring the offender very far. Prof Ashworth accounts for the general lace of persuasiveness of such arguments in the following lucid fashion (_Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ at p 194)

>> Is there any merit in this source of mitigation \[_ie_, the effect of the crime on the offender’s career\]? Once courts begin to adjust sentences for collateral consequences, it this not a step towards the idea of wider social accounting which was rejected above? … Moreover, there is a discrimination argument here too. If collateral consequences were accepted as a regular mitigating factor, this would operate in favour of members of the professional classes and against ‘common thieves’ who would either be unemployed or working in jobs where a criminal record is no barrier. It would surely be wrong to support a principle which institutionalized discrimination between employed and unemployed offenders.

> Whichever way one looks at it, **I do not regard it as relevant to sentencing. A person who breaches the criminal law can expect to face the consequences that follow under the criminal law**. Whether or not such an offender has already or may as a result suffer other professional or contractual consequences should not be relevant to the sentencing court.”

72     This passage succinctly sums up that little (or no) mitigating weight should be attached to a claim that the usual punishment for an offence would have a deleterious effect on the offender’s future prospects.

##### (5)   The Accused’s loss of his scholarship

73     In a similar vein to the passage at \[71\] above, I found that the fact that the Accused had been suspended from NUS, was directed by NUS to serve 60 hours of community service and had lost his Kent Ridge Undergraduate Scholarship were not factors that I should consider in determining the appropriate sentence.

##### (6)   The Accused’s good character

74     The Defence tendered a number of testimonials by relative, teachers, friends and employers of the Accused. These testimonials cast the Accused is a very favourable light; however, I did not ascribe much mitigating weight to them.

##### (7)   Accused familial support

75     I accepted that the Accused’s parents were supportive of the Accused and would undoubtedly do their best to steer the Accused away from re-offending. However, in light of the aggravating factors, I did not think this factor was sufficient to justify a CBS option.

#### Is CBS an appropriate sentencing option?

76     I have found at paragraphs \[42\] and \[43\] above that because of the seriousness of these offences deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration and, in view of the aggravating factors, this consideration would be met by a custodial sentence. However, the need for deterrence does not mean that the sentencing objective of rehabilitation is totally displaced: _Hoon Qi Tong_ at \[11\]. If I found that even after considering the principle of rehabilitation, I still found that a custodial sentence was warranted this did not preclude the imposition of an SDO as an SDO carries a punitive and deterrent element: _Sim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 207</span>.

77     The rationale for community based sentencing was enunciated by the Minister for Law and then Second Minister for Home Affairs Mr K Shanmugam during the second reading of the Criminal Procedure Code Bill (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (18 May 2010), vol 87 at col 422):

> CBS gives more flexibility to the Courts. Not every offender should be put in prison**. CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum**, i.e. regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions. For such, cases it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community. The offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefits from the focused treatment. \[**Emphasis mine**\]

78     In _Sim Wei En_, See J considered whether CBS options would be appropriate and stated; at \[40\]:

> The important point that emerges from the above authorities is that the suitability of the various types of CBS orders depends on the type of offender and the type of offence. This calls for an open-textured assessment and this highly contextualisd and the court must have regard to all the facts of the case. Some types of CBS may have greater relevant in the cases which involve youthful offenders since such offenders are often seen to have greater rehabilitative capacity. Nevertheless, I did not think that offenders over the age of 21 should _ipso facto_ be denied the opportunity be considered for CBS. The rehabilitative aim does not automatically recede into the background once the offender reaches 21 years of age. In every case, **the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender in question must be carefully scrutinised and evaluated to determine whether rehabilitation should be given prominence notwithstanding any countervailing need for deterrence, retribution or prevention**: _Kalaiarasi d/o Marimuthu Innasimuthu v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 774</span>. Thus the appropriateness of CBS is a question which turns on all the relevant circumstances of each case, including the offence and the offender in question. \[**Emphasis mine**\]

79     In _Sim Wei En_ the appellant, a 26-year old man, had appealed against the imposition of a seven week sentence of imprisonment of an offence under s 324 of the PC. The Accused had shot at three unsuspecting persons using an airsoft gun. On appeal, See J amended the charge to one under s 337(a). Having amended the charge, See J found that while probation was not appropriate, a rehabilitative approach should not be wholly disregarded. See J held that the accused had not re-offended since the offences, he had no previous convictions and he was unlikely to re-offend. See J found that while general deterrence remained relevant he felt that it could be achieved with a mix of CBS options and he sentenced the appellant to a one week SDO and a CSO requiring him to perform 150 hours of community service: _Sim Wen Yi_ at \[42\].

80     I was alive to the fact that there were similarities between the Accused and the appellant in _Sim Yi Wen_. Both were in their mid-20s when they committed the offences, both had no antecedents and had remained crime-free in the time after their offences and I would accept that it was unlikely that the Accused, like the appellant in _Sim Yi Wen_, would re-offend. However, I found a crucial difference between the present case and _Sim Yi Wen_ was the nature of the offence committed by the respective offenders.

81     Insulting modesty offences, both involving upskirting type offences and offences of the sort in the present case, have become all too common with the advent of mobile phones fitted with miniaturised cameras. The sentences that are usually imposed for these type of s 509 offences reflect this fact and the need to send a strong deterrent message to would be offenders that these offences will not be tolerated. The Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents would show that even for cases involving offenders around the age of the Accused who faced only a single charge under s 509 the typical sentences range around eight to nine weeks’ imprisonment.

82     By contrast, the offence that the appellant in _Sim Yi Wen_ had committed, i.e. s 337(a) by shooting pellets at victims from an airsoft gun is not a typical or common offence seen in Singapore. The ability to obtain airsoft guns, unlike mobile phones equipped with cameras, is far more curtailed. I found that the need for a strong deterrent sentence to deter the type of offences in _Sim Yi Wen_ was not as great as the need for deterrent sentences in s 509 cases.

83     In _Public Prosecutor v Teo Chang Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1163</span>, the respondent pleaded guilty to a charge of mischief, an offence under s 426 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The respondent, who was undergoing marital woes at the material time, saw his spouse’s boyfriend driving her car and, consumed by anger and frustration, he deliberately used his vehicle to inflict damage to his spouse’s car.

84     See J found, at \[18\], that the facts of this case to be “_unusual and exceptional_”. The respondent was a first time offender, he had no antecedents and he had not re-offended after committing the s 426 offence. Crucially, See J found that the respondent had “pleaded guilty” at the scene of the crime as it was the respondent who had immediately called the police to report the incident, remained at the scene till the police arrived and turned himself in, he had also made prompt payment of the full repair costs: _Teo Chang Heng_ at \[7\]. See J held, at \[14\]:

> The facts of this case are unusual and possibly quite exceptional. The respondent snapped and acted rashly and impulsively, in hot blood and without actual planning and premeditation. But he had acted consciously and deliberately. Within a matter of moments, he immediately sought to atone for what he had done – he called the police to surrender himself. His act of self-reporting his offence was demonstrably spontaneous, reflecting genuine remorse and palpable contrition. This strongly indicates his potential for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.

85     The Accused also shares some similarities with the respondent in _Teo Chang Heng._ However, I found that the present case was not an unusual or exceptional case; in fact, it was a very typical case of an offender insulting the modesty of women by recording them at their private moments. As I have found at paragraphs \[52\] to \[55\] whilst there was not premeditation there was an element of planning and he was goal-oriented. I would disagree that the Accused had acted in hot blood or that he had acted impulsively.

86     In addition, the Accused did not self-report his offence and he had the opportunity to do so. During the incident on 14 February, ABC had shouted out when she realised that there was someone holding a mobile phone over the cubicle. The Accused must have been aware that ABC had almost caught him. If the Accused felt guilt at committing the offence then the right thing to do would have been to turn himself in or, at the very least, cease his offending behaviour. Instead, two or three weeks later, perhaps after he realised that he his earlier offence remained undiscovered, he blatantly committed the second offence. Unlike the respondent in _Tan Chang Heng_, I found that the Accused’s actions immediately following the commission of the offences did not strongly indicate his potential for rehabilitation.

87     See J held in _Tan Chang Heng_, at \[17\]:

> The custodial threshold was clearly crossed. In terms of punishment, a SDO will still result in the respondent spending time behind bars for his misdeeds. The SDP in fact signals that what he did was serious and he is not being let off scott-free. As such, I am unable to see why there is any violation of a distinct public interest or inappropriate messaging if the SDO is upheld on the facts of this case. **I might have been more readily persuaded otherwise if the facts at hand had warranted a much lengthier term of imprisonment – say, exceeding four weeks.** The prosecution very fairly did not attempt to pitch its case that high.

88     Therefore, See J found that the period of incarceration that the respondent would serve under the SDO was commensurate to the imprisonment sentence that may have been imposed had it been found that CSOs were inappropriate. In the present case, the sentence that the Prosecution sought was eight weeks’ imprisonment and this submission was supported by the case precedents. I found that the imposition of an SDO, with a maximum period of incarceration of only two weeks, in the present case would be far more lenient that a sentence of imprisonment. An SDO would send an inappropriate message and would dilute the need for general deterrence.

89     Unlike in _Teo Chang Heng_ I found that there are pressing public policy considerations, such as the need to curb the rising trend of section 509 offences involving offenders either recording upskirts or recording women in their private moments, and the need to protect the victims of these offences. Therefore, I found these public policy considerations did militate against the imposition of CBS options.

90     In _Hoon Qi Tong_, the respondent, a 25-year old man, had used his mobile phone to record a single video clip of a woman easing herself in a toilet. The respondent, like the Accused, had no criminal record, was an undergraduate and had not re-offended since the commission of his offence. The District Judge had agreed with the Prosecution that deterrence was a sentencing consideration, however, he found that in that case rehabilitation was not totally displaced. Balancing the needs of deterrence and rehabilitation the District Judge sentenced the Accused to a combination of an SDO and CSO. The District Judge’s decision was upheld on appeal.

91     As stated by See J in _Sim Wei En_, in determining whether a CBS option was appropriate I had to consider the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender. I found that there were significant differences between the Accused and the respondent in _Hoon Qi Tong._

92     First, the respondent in _Hoon Qi Tong_ had been diagnosed, by both an IMH and a private psychiatrist, as suffering from Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) and Dr Derrick Yeo, the IMH psychiatrist, had opined that the PDD had a “mild but existent contributing factor for \[the\] commission of the offence” and that his “low mood caused him to opportunistically engage in the offensive acts with poor judgement and without due consideration to the consequences”: _Hoon Qi Tong_ at \[18\]. There was no evidence that the Accused was suffering from any psychiatric condition at the time of the commission of the offence, let alone one that might have had a contributory effect.

93     Second, the respondent in _Hoon Qi Tong_ had committed a single 509 offence. As such, the aggravating factor of multiple victims did not feature in _Hoon Qi Tong_. In his case, this was clearly a one-off offence. This was clearly different to the situation facing the current Accused. I would reiterate that despite having a close brush on 14 February where he was almost caught, the Accused did not stop offending.

94     I did not give any weight to the News Articles that the Defence tendered in support of the submission for CBS options.

95     I found that there was little other objective evidence pointing to the fact that the Accused had strong rehabilitative potential. The Defence had not tendered any reports from the Counselling and Care Centre updating on the efficacy of the Accused’s counselling. I found that rehabilitation did not trump deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration. Therefore, having considered the three cases above, I found that the Accused’s circumstances and the circumstances of the offences committed by the Accused did not warrant the imposition of CBS options.

#### Appropriateness of a fine

96     The Defence submitted that in the event I found that CBS was not appropriate then I should impose a fine. The primary thrust of the Defence submission was that the present case shared similarities with _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span>. The appellant, who was a resident at a University hall of residence, was outside the female toilets when he heard someone showering. He decided to enter the toilet to peep at the person who was showering. He went into the shower cubicle next to the victim and peeped over the partition seeing the victim naked. The victim noticed the Accused and immediately sought help. The Accused remained in the cubicle and eventually surrendered to campus security. See J allowed the appeal and substituted a sentence of one month’s imprisonment with a fine of $5,000.

97     See J referred to _Chong Hou En_ and pointed out that as Chan J had found that as a custodial sentence was not warranted as a starting point even where the aggravating factor of the use of technology was present, then the threshold for the imposition of a custodial term when the offender had not used technology should be higher: _GCO_ at \[99\]. See J held that the key consideration was whether the offence was premeditated and he found on the facts of that case there was nothing to suggest that the accused had applied a great deal of foresight or planning prior to committing the offence: _GCO_ at \[101\].

98     I found that _GCO_ was distinguishable from the present case. First, in _GCO_ the appellant clearly did not have a pre-formed plan to enter the toilet, instead he reacted on the spur of the moment when he was outside the female toilet and realised that there was someone showering. As I have found at paragraphs \[52\] to \[55\] the Accused did have a pre-formed plan. On both occasions, he was tempted to look at women showering and then deliberately made his want to the female toilet. This was not a case of the Accused finding himself outside the female toilet and then giving into the temptation.

99     Second, the Accused’s level of planning was also apparent from the fact that he brought his mobile phone with him so that he could record images of the women should there be any showering. This was especially apparent with regard to the offence committed on 14 February as the Accused had gone from this room to the female toilet armed with his mobile phone in the hopes of recording the illicit images.

100    Third, in _GCO_ the appellant had committed a single offence and, as such the aggravating factor of multiple victims did not apply and his offence, at least with regard to the s 509 offence, was a one-off aberration. This was not so in the present case.

101    For these reasons, I found that _GCO_ was distinguishable and in view of the aggravating factors present in this case a fine would be inadequate to achieve the objective of general deterrence.

102    The Defence also referred to _Public Prosecutor v Yee Chun Wei_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 15</span>, where the District Judge sentenced the Accused to a fine of $5,000 for a single s 509 offence. I found that _Yee Chun Wei_ could be distinguished from the present case. First, the respondent in that case had committed a single offence of filming an upskirt video whilst he and the victim were on an ascending escalator: _Yee Chun Wei_ at \[38\]. The level of intrusion in upskirt cases is far lower than cases like the present case where the victims were recorded in the nude. The sentences that the Courts have imposed for s 509 offences that involve upskirting are generally lower than the sentences imposed for offences where the Accused records the victims in the toilet or in changing rooms attending to their personal needs.

103    Second, the District Judge held that there was no sophisticated planning: _Yee Chun Wei_ at \[38\]. Whilst I accept that there was no sophistication in the offence committed by the Accused I have found that the Accused had planned the offences. This distinguishes the Accused’s circumstances from the respondent in _Yee Chun Wei._ Third, the District Judge took note of the fact that the respondent was suffering from a depressive disorder at the time of the commission of the offence: _Yee Chun Wei_ at \[38\]. Whilst it was not explicitly stated in the decision whether the District Judge took this as a mitigating factor it would appear that some weight was placed on this fact. In contrast there was no evidence that the Accused was suffering from any mental disability at the time he committed the offences. As such, I found that _Yee Chun Wei_ was not an authority to support the imposition of a fine in the present case.

#### The length of the custodial sentence

104    The Prosecution had tendered a table of sentencing precedents. I was aware that there were no grounds of decision and that I should treat the precedents with caution. However, based on the facts contained in the table, such as the age of the offender, the number of proceeded charges and the level of intrusion there were similarities with the present case and I found that the precedents could be considered as a guide to the typical sentences imposed in situations similar to the Accused’s.

105    The offenders in all the precedents were sentenced to terms of imprisonment between eight weeks and ten weeks. I did not think that the fact that the offenders in four of the five precedents were co-tenants with the victim was in any way more aggravating than the present case. In both situations the victims, i.e. a tenant or a student resident in hall of residence, would have an expectation, as they are in the place where they live, that their fellow tenants or students would not commit offences such as these. The expectation of trust that exists between co-tenants should similarly be expected between students residing in a hall of residence.

106    I found, based on these precedents, that it would be appropriate for me to impose a sentence between eight to ten weeks on the Accused.

107    I agreed that there were additional aggravating factors in _Chong Hou En_, such as the young age of some of the respondent’s victims, the fact that there was a higher degree of planning and premeditation and the use of sophisticated devices. These factors did not feature in the present case. As such, I found that the sentence I imposed against the Accused should be less than the 12 weeks’ imprisonment imposed by Chan J in _Chong Hou En._

108    I did not think the two other precedents referred to by the Defence, _Tay Beng Guan_ or _Public Prosecutor v Tan Lian Koon_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 39</span> were instructive as both had been decided prior to _Chong Hou En._

## Conclusion

109    I found that general deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration in this case. I found that there were aggravating factors and that in view of these factors the objective of deterrence would be met by the imposition of a custodial sentence. I found that CBS options were not an appropriate sentence and that the imposition of a fine would similarly not meet the objectives of deterrence.

110    Having considered the aggravating factors and giving due weight to the mitigating factors at paragraphs \[59\] to \[62\] above I sentenced the Accused to seven weeks’ imprisonment per charge. I directed that both sentences were to run concurrently. I found that the sentence adequately reflected the need for general deterrence.

111    Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
