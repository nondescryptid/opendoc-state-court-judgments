### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused, a 29 years old male Malaysian, pleaded guilty to a charge of selling 17 packets of granular/powdery substance containing not less than 8.35 grams of diamorphine, an offence of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) punishable under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185 (“MDA”).

2       On 20 Feb 19, at about 4.00 am, the Accused entered Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint on his motorcycle registration number JPL 1410. In the front basket of the motorcycle was a white plastic packet containing two bundles wrapped in newspaper. The two bundles contained diamorphine. The Accused had instructions to sell the diamorphine to one Ayup Khan s/o Muzaffa Khan (“Ayup”) in Singapore. The Accused was promised S$200 to S$300 for doing this. From Woodlands Checkpoint, the Accused rode to Tiong Bahru Plaza. He met up with Ayup in the vicinity of a carpark at Jalan Bukit Ho Swee at about 5.30 pm. There, he sold the two bundles of diamorphine to Ayup. Ayup handed him S$5,200 for the drugs. They then left the scene. The Accused was arrested at the Woodlands Checkpoint at about 6.05 am. The S$5,200 was seized from him. Ayup was arrested at 6.15 am at Jalan Bukit Ho Swee. The drugs were found in his flat.

3       HSA analysis confirmed that the two bundles contained not less than 8.35 grams of diamorphine.

4       The Accused has no criminal record.

5       DPP Arvindren submitted that applying the sentencing framework in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span> (“_Vasentha_”), the indicative starting point for this case was 10 to 13 years imprisonment and nine to 10 strokes of the cane. After that, the starting point could be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the aggravating and/or mitigating factors present. DPP Arvindren highlighted the aggravating factors present. The Accused’s motivation in committing the offence was for financial gain. There was a transnational character to the offence. In the Accused’s favour, DPP Arvindren conceded that his role was limited in the sense that he was acting on instructions. Further, he has rendered his full cooperation to CNB, and pleaded guilty.

6       The Accused pleaded for a lenient sentence. He revealed that he was married with two young children, aged four years and eighteen months. He was the main caregiver of the family.

7       In this case, the weight of the diamorphine was 8.35 grams. Applying _Vasentha_ (at \[47\] of the judgment), the indicative starting point was 10 to 13 years’ imprisonment and nine to 10 strokes of the cane. In adjusting the final sentence, I noted that he had committed the offence for personal gain. However, this aggravating factor was moderated by his limited role and involvement. He was just the mule acting on the instructions of the people behind the operation. I also noted his early plea of guilty, and his cooperation with CNB.

8       Given that the weight of the diamorphine was at the lower end of the range of eight to nine grams, the sentence should fall on the lower end of the range as well. As such, I sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane.

9       The Accused has appealed against the sentence. He is currently serving sentence.
