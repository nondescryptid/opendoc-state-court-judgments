Damages – Measure of damages – Personal injuries cases

Evidence – Weight of evidence

11 September 2020

### District Judge Thian Yee Sze:

## Introduction

1       This was an appeal in respect of the Deputy Registrar’s award of damages for the loss of future earnings, and the dismissal of the claim in loss of earning capacity and pre-trial loss of earnings arising out of injuries suffered in a motor accident between a motorcycle which the plaintiff was riding and another motorcycle on 14 November 2016. The main injury which the plaintiff suffered was a closed fracture of his left clavicle. By consent, interlocutory judgment was entered in the plaintiff’s favour to the extent of 85% of the damages to be assessed.

2       After hearing counsel’s submissions, I allowed the plaintiff’s appeal in respect of his claim for pre-trial loss of earnings and the defendant’s cross-appeal against the award for loss of future earnings. I dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal in respect of his claim for loss of earning capacity. These are the grounds of my decision.

## Facts

3       The plaintiff was 34 years old at the time of the hearing on assessment of damages. He holds a diploma in IT and a degree in marketing[^1]. At the time of the accident, he worked at Blastech Abrasives Pte Ltd (“Blastech”) as an Information Technology (IT) Officer at a basic monthly salary of $2,873, as reflected in his salary slips for January and February 2017[^2]. Based on his Notices of Assessment for income tax, his annual salary at Blastech in 2014, 2015 and 2016 was $47,155[^3], $48,200[^4] and $41,965[^5] respectively, inclusive of bonuses. The plaintiff said that the annual salary included a variable bonus component which varied from year to year and was dependent on the amount of profit the company made each year[^6].

4       According to the plaintiff, his core duties entailed carrying heavy equipment such as computers and printers. It was stated in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief that after the accident, he had difficulty carrying a load of even 1 kg[^7] because of the residual pain to his left shoulder, although the plaintiff clarified during cross-examination that he could carry a load of up to 3kg[^8] with his left hand, albeit for short periods. He added that as he was the only one dealing with all IT matters at Blastech, he had to carry out all the duties himself, including the carrying of equipment. Dr Eileen Tay (Dr Tay), an Associate Consultant at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, operated on the plaintiff’s left clavicle. He was placed on hospitalisation leave for almost three months from 15 November 2016 to 12 February 2017. The plaintiff said that after he returned to the office, his employer verbally conveyed to him to leave the company in light of his declining work performance and his long “injury leave”[^9]. As a result of that, he had little choice but to tender his resignation on 16 March 2017, which was accepted by the company on the same day together with one month’s salary in lieu of notice.

5       The plaintiff was unemployed between 17 March 2017 and 2 July 2017. He found another job about three and a half months later and commenced work on 3 July 2017 at ISS M&E Pte Ltd (“ISS”) as an FRC Supervisor, drawing a gross monthly salary of $2,475[^10]. I noted that the scope of duties as an FRC Supervisor was essentially administrative in nature, and did not require much manual labour. He stayed at ISS for almost eight months, after which he joined Commonwealth Freight Services Pte Ltd (“Commonwealth”) on 27 February 2018 as an Operations Executive at a basic monthly salary of $2,800[^11]. When asked during cross-examination why he left ISS, the Plaintiff said that he could not get used to working in shifts as he “was already accustomed to working during office hours”[^12]. The plaintiff was still in the employment of Commonwealth at the time of the assessment hearing in May 2019 and at the appeal hearing in Frebuary this year[^13].

## Applicable principles in determining an award of damages in personal injury cases

6       An award of damages serves to compensate the plaintiff for the damage, loss or injury he has suffered. In respect of tort, the sum of money awarded seeks to put the injured plaintiff in the position he would have been in had the tort not been committed – this is the principle of _restitutio in integrum_. As the Court of Appeal explained _in Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“_Shaw Linda Gillian_”) at \[29\], in the context of personal injury claims:

> The overarching objective of awarding damages is to _compensate_ the injured victim by restoring him or her to the position that he or she would have been (in a monetary sense) had the accident not happened.

7       In assessing the quantum of damages, a distinction is made between special and general damages. From the point of view of pleading and proof, special damages refer to losses that are capable of substantially exact calculation in the form of pre-trial pecuniary loss, whereas general damages refer to non-pecuniary loss and future pecuniary loss. Special damages in the form of pre-trial loss in personal injury actions, including loss of earnings, seek to compensate the plaintiff for losses already incurred and can be calculated. General damages for post-trial loss seek to compensate the plaintiff for the natural or probable consequence of the defendant’s act which cannot be calculated with precision. The distinctions between pre-trial and post-trial loss, and between general and special damages, were clearly demonstrated by Lord Goddard in the leading House of Lords decision on the assessment of damages in personal injury claims in _British Transport Commission v Gourley_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] 1 AC 185</span> at 206 (and cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in _Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin and anor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 230</span> at \[31\]):

> In an action for personal injuries the damages are always divided into two main parts. First, there is what is referred to as special damage, which has to be specially pleaded and proved. This consists of out-of-pocket expenses and loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally capable of substantially exact calculation. Secondly, there is general damage which the law implies and is not specially pleaded. This includes compensation for pain and suffering and the like, and, if the injuries suffered are such as to lead to continuing or permanent disability, compensation for loss of earning power in the future.

8       The reason for this distinction was explained by Kannan Ramesh JC (as he then was) in _Lee Mui Yeng v Ng Tong Yoo_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 46</span> at \[63\] – \[66\]:

> 63    In the context of personal injury cases, however, special damage is not confined to only “such a loss as the law will not presume to be the consequence of the defendant’s act”. It also includes “out-of-pocket expenses and loss of earnings which the plaintiff has incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally capable of substantially exact calculation” (see _British Transport Commission v Gourley_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] 1 AC 185</span> at 206). As Lord Donavan pointed out in _Perestrello E Companhia Limitada v United Paint Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 1 WLR 570</span> at 579:

>> The obligation to particularise \[such damages\] arises not because the nature of the loss is necessarily unusual, but because a plaintiff who has the advantage of being able to base his claim upon a precise calculation must give the defendant access to the facts which make such calculation possible.

> 64    In _Ilkiw v Samuels and others_ <span class="citation">\[1963\] 1 WLR 991</span>, a claimant in an action for personal injury had pleaded and particularised the loss of earnings at £77, which was based on four months’ loss of earnings after the accident. The court held that the claimant was not entitled to recover for the continuing loss of wages over the next eight years prior to trial as these had not been pleaded as special damage.

> …

> 66    Hence, in an action for personal injuries, a plaintiff is required to plead expenses or loss of earnings that he or she has already incurred where these can be quantified with near exactitude. The principle is in place to give the defendant an opportunity to prepare his case as well as to consider settlement possibilities. The failure to plead special damages will in the ordinary case disentitle the plaintiff to claim such damages from the defendant unless no prejudice has ensued (see _Ng Bee Lian v Fernandez and another_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 2 SLR(R) 179</span> at \[30\]).

9       Bearing in mind the above principles in assessing the amount of damages to be awarded, I dealt with each head of claim under appeal in turn.

## Pre-trial loss of earnings

10     In assessing if damages should be awarded to the plaintiff for pre-trial loss of earnings, as he had sought on appeal, there were two questions to be answered: first, whether the plaintiff’s resignation from Blastech was a consequence of the injuries suffered in the accident; second, if the first question was answered in the affirmative, the extent to which the plaintiff suffered a diminution in his pre-accident income. I bore in mind the fact that a calculation of the loss of earnings to this end was dependent on the assumption that, but for the injuries suffered, the claimant would have continued to earn at the same rate as he did before the accident.

### Whether the plaintiff’s resignation was a consequence of the injuries suffered in the accident

11     Although the plaintiff was cross-examined on the point as to whether he was asked to leave Blastech or if he resigned voluntarily, it was not seriously disputed that he was asked to leave the company as his work performance had dropped because of his inability to carry out a core part of his job which involved the moving of IT equipment, coupled with his going on “long injury leave” after the accident, which necessitated the company finding another person to carry out his duties as the sole IT officer[^14]. I accepted the plaintiff’s evidence that he was asked to leave the company because of his work performance and found that the plaintiff’s resignation from Blastech was a direct consequence of the accident for which he was on medical leave for almost three months.

12     Dr Tay’s specialist medical report dated 10 February 2017[^15], which was based on her review of the plaintiff on 24 January 2017, stated that the plaintiff had a limited range of motion of his left shoulder at that time. When Dr Tay, who was the plaintiff’s treating doctor, reviewed him again on 8 June 2017[^16], while the range of motion had improved, the plaintiff still suffered from residual restrictions in the movement of his left arm. During cross-examination, Dr Han Fucai (Dr Han), an Associate Consultant at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital who on 4 September 2017 wrote the clarification report for Dr Tay’s earlier specialist medical report, explained that the restriction in external rotation equated to a 2% permanent disability based on the “guide to the Assessment of Traumatic Injuries and Occupational Diseases for Workmen’s Compensation”[^17]. When asked what the 2% permanent disability meant in practical terms, Dr Tay stated during cross-examination that as the plaintiff had limited external rotation, he was:

> … unable to rotate out the arm fully and limited internal rotation, based on the assessment. A bit hard to say what he can or cannot do. He might not be able to reach back as far, he might have limitation in putting his arm behind his back. Arm going out and arm going behind – slightly restricted.

> (Notes of Evidence dated 8 July 2019 at page 9C – D)

13     She added that his left arm would be weak at the “terminal range of motion”[^18]. It was clear from the medical assessment by the treating doctor, coupled with that by Dr Han, who based his clarification report on the plaintiff’s medical records with the hospital and Dr Tay’s notes, that at the time of the plaintiff’s resignation, he was not able to adequately perform a key function of carrying IT equipment as part of his duties as an IT officer at Blastech. Dr Han also confirmed that during the period of the plaintiff’s hospitalisation, he “was not able to perform duties in his usual occupation”[^19]. The medical evidence buttressed my finding that the plaintiff resigned from Blastech as he had no other choice when he was asked to leave because of the decline in his performance.

### The extent to which the plaintiff suffered a diminution in his pre-accident income

14     Having determined that the injuries suffered in the accident caused the plaintiff to lose his job at Blastech, I turned to the question of the extent of the loss of his pre-accident income which was attributable to the injuries suffered.

15     I first examined the medical evidence in relation to the permanent disabilities the plaintiff suffered as that had a direct bearing on whether the permanent disabilities he had to live with as a result of the injuries suffered hampered his ability to earn his pre-accident income.

#### Weight to be accorded the medical evidence

16     Three medical reports were put up for the purposes of the hearing for the assessment of damages. The first was the specialist medical report by Dr Tay dated 10 February 2017 and the second was the report by Dr Han to clarify Dr Tay’s specialist medical report, both of which I made reference to above. Dr Tay and Dr Han appeared as the plaintiff’s witnesses at the assessment hearing below. I should add that Dr Han had never seen the plaintiff – his expert assessment was based on the hospital’s and Dr Tay’s records on the plaintiff. The third medical report dated 27 August 2018 was put up by Dr Edwin Tan Tze Sheng (Dr Tan), a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Singapore General Hospital. Dr Tan examined the plaintiff on 30 May 2018 at the request of the defendant for the purposes of giving an expert opinion but was not called to testify as he left Singapore General Hospital subsequently and could not be located[^20]. Nevertheless, I noted that Dr Tan’s report was listed in the plaintiff’s supplementary list of documents dated 30 April 2019 and admitted as part of the bundle of documents for the assessment hearing[^21] without objection from the defendant, and that both the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s counsel referred to and relied on Dr Tan’s medical report in their written submissions at the hearing below and in the submissions in the present appeal. While the inclusion of Dr Tan’s report in the plaintiff’s list of documents meant that parties admitted the authenticity of the report, the weight to be given to Dr Tan’s evidence in the absence of cross-examination was something the court had to bear in mind.

17     The role and responsibilities of the expert and the function of the expert report in court proceedings have been explained in various contexts, from expert opinions on foreign law in civil proceedings[^22] to psychiatric reports tendered to aid in the determination of liability and sentence in criminal proceedings[^23] to expert reports submitted to help determine professional standards applicable to doctors[^24]. Given the importance of expert evidence in the determination of issues in dispute which would have a material bearing on the outcome of a case, the courts have reiterated that it is imperative that experts not only present their conclusions but also present the underlying evidence and the analytical process by which the conclusions are reached. Otherwise, the court will commonly reject that evidence (see _Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 887</span> at \[2\]). In _Singapore Medical Council v Lim Lian Arn_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 172</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ stated why it was critical for the expert to state the basis or grounds of his conclusions at \[43\]:

> It is important that an expert demonstrate how a conclusion is reached. This is so that the court is in a position to consider whether the expert’s reasoning is sound and, in turn, evaluate the worth of the opinion appropriately. An expert report that consists of conclusions only without any reasons supporting the conclusions offers no assistance, and it is the duty of counsel to ensure that the evidence proffered meets the minimum standards.

18     With these guiding principles in mind, I turned to consider the weight to be accorded the medical evidence adduced.

19     The plaintiff contended that he continued to suffer both pain and a limited range of motion in his left arm such that it affected his ability to work in the same line of work before the accident occurred. According to the plaintiff, he could not lift heavy loads because of the pain he continued to suffer.

20     On the plaintiff’s assertion that he could not carry heavier loads with his left arm because of the residual pain, Dr Tay clarified at the assessment hearing that the statement in her specialist medical report in February 2017 that the plaintiff was “… unable to carry loads of even 1kg due to the pain” was based solely on what the plaintiff told her and that she did not conduct any test to verify that claim[^25]. To put it in another way, there was no objective underlying evidence to support Dr Tay’s conclusion that the plaintiff was not able to carry heavy loads because of the pain. She stated that while it was common for patients to experience pain, they should usually recover fully about three to six months after the surgery, and that she had expected the plaintiff “to return to normal or almost normal”[^26]. Dr Han’s clarification report made no mention of this aspect, and he confirmed at the hearing that there was no record of a strength test done in this regard. He added that based on the medical records, he was not able to determine if the plaintiff could carry files or laptop bags, although generally speaking, a patient whose fracture had healed would be able to carry out such normal functions if there were no complications, pain or stiffness[^27]. For completeness, Dr Tan’s report, which the plaintiff relied on to support his case, did not indicate that he conducted a test to verify the plaintiff’s complaints of pain and inability to lift heavier loads. That said, he opined that the plaintiff would be able to lift loads of more than or equal to 1kg, adding that “(T)he assessment by Dr Eileen Tay was performed on 24th January 2017 and this was 2 months after the surgery, hence, strength and range of motion would not be expected to have stabilized as yet”[^28]. I noted that Dr Tan examined the plaintiff to assess the range of motion of both shoulders. While I accepted that the plaintiff experienced pain in January and February 2017, as confirmed by Dr Tay to be a common occurrence and that it usually took 3 – 6 months for patients to recover, and that this hampered his ability to carry heavier loads at the time when he left Blastech, there was no objective medical evidence to support his claim that he could not lift relatively heavier loads because of the pain that he continued to suffer as of June 2017 when Dr Tay last saw him. I hence found that the plaintiff failed to prove that he was unable to lift heavier loads by virtue of the pain after June 2017.

21     As for the contention that the plaintiff suffered a permanent disability on the account of the limited range of motion of his left shoulder, the range of motion of the plaintiff’s left shoulder was still restricted in June 2017 when Dr Tay last examined him, although there was an improvement from the time she saw him in January 2017 (see Dr Tay and Dr Han’s assessment at paragraph 12 above). When Dr Tan examined the plaintiff about one year later on 30 May 2018, the range of motion of his left shoulder improved marginally by 10 degrees (from 160 degrees for both the forward flexion and abduction[^29] to 170 degrees for both forward flexion and abduction[^30]). This was 15 degrees less than that of the right shoulder. Dr Tan opined in his report that “(t)his reduction in terminal range of motion is likely to be permanent as it is more than 18 months after his index surgery”[^31] and was “similar to the findings of Dr Han Fu Cai in his report dated 4th September 2017”[^32] . In his report, Dr Tan set out the clinical basis for his expert opinion in this regard – like Dr Tay and Dr Han before him, he conducted the requisite tests to measure the plaintiff’s left shoulder’s range of motion. As a matter of fact, both Dr Tan and Dr Han came to the same conclusion as to the assessment of 2% permanent disability, and there was consensus between them in respect of their findings. Both the plaintiff and the defendant’s counsel did not dispute Dr Tan’s findings and relied on the same to support their arguments. I was also satisfied that the conclusions which he reached in his expert report were supported by proper clinical evidence. I hence gave the content of Dr Tan’s report due weight. To this end, I accepted Dr Tan’s assessment that the plaintiff could “continue in his current occupation as a supervisor or administrator. However, ability to perform manual work with heavy load lifting may be affected as he would experience difficulty and early fatigue with overhead loads.”[^33]

22     In gist, based on the medical evidence which I detailed above and which I accepted, I found that the plaintiff’s limited range of motion of his left shoulder was a continuing and permanent disability which impacted his ability to carry heavy loads.

#### Whether the permanent disability suffered resulted in a loss of pre-trial income for the plaintiff

23     I had earlier found that the plaintiff had to leave his job at Blastech because of the injuries he suffered. A claimant for damages should take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss to him consequent upon the defendant’s wrong. He cannot recover for the loss avoided as a result of successful mitigatory measures. I was satisfied that the plaintiff made best efforts to secure another job, as can be seen from the records in respect of his job applications[^34]. The plaintiff sought positions as an IT officer, as well as other other positions which were not physically strenuous, eg as a call centre officer, human resources management trainee and a recruitment consultant. Although the plaintiff resigned from Blastech on 16 March 2017 and his employment with the company ceased on that very date, he was paid one month’s salary in lieu of notice, which meant that he should hence be compensated for the loss of income suffered during his period of unemployment between 17 April and 2 July 2017.

24     In the course of the hearing of the appeal, I pointed out to counsel that the plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial loss of earnings was only for the period of unemployment although the evidence led and arguments raised clearly related to the loss of earnings after 2 July 2017. As a matter of law, pre-trial loss of earnings form part of the claim for special damages and are for the period up to the day of the trial, and post-trial loss of earnings form part of general damages and are for the period after the trial. Both counsel agreed that it should be the case and made further written submissions under this head to cover the remaining period when the plaintiff was employed at ISS and Commonwealth.

25     The plaintiff complained that he was not used to working in shifts as he was used to working normal office hours at Blastech. As a result, he left ISS. While this was his prerogative, the court would expect the plaintiff to make adaptations to adjust his working habits to a reasonable extent in order to mitigate the damages suffered rather than pin all the loss he suffered on the defendant. In other words, a defendant is not liable for all the loss suffered by the plaintiff in consequence of the plaintiff’s own actions or preferences; a defendant is only liable for such part of the plaintiff’s loss as is properly caused by the defendant’s breach. Hence, any loss of income awarded to the plaintiff between 3 July 2017 and 26 February 2018 should not be based on the fact that his working hours were arranged in a different way from his time with Blastech.

26     The Deputy Registrar did not make an award for pre-trial loss of earnings as she found that there was no evidence on the plaintiff’s last drawn salary at the point of resignation. With respect, I did not agree that there was no evidence in this regard. The general rule is that special damages have to be strictly proved; otherwise they are not recoverable: see _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> at \[15\]. While the pre-trial loss of earnings that must be proved is generally calculated on the basis of what the plaintiff was earning at the time of the accident, it does not mean that it must be based on the very last pay slip or the pay in the last few months of the plaintiff’s employment. I found that the Notices of Assessment for income tax, which reflected the plaintiff’s annual salary at Blastech in 2014, 2015 and 2016, provided sufficiently objective and accurate documentary evidence for the court to arrive at a reasonably accurate assessment of the plaintiff’s pre-accident income, inclusive of bonuses.

27     In determining the plaintiff’s pre-accident monthly salary at Blastech, I accepted the plaintiff’s method of calculation by taking the average of the annual salaries between 2014 and 2016 (the accident happened on 14 November 2016 and the plaintiff resigned in March 2017) and dividing it by 12 months. This amounted to $3,814.44 per month. I noted that at the hearing below, the defendant also submitted that the plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial earnings should be calculated based on this formulation[^35]. At the appeal, however, the defendant changed his position and argued that any loss of pre-trial earnings to be awarded should be based on the plaintiff’s basic salary, excluding discretionary bonuses. Defendant’s counsel submitted in the alternative that the monthly salary at Blastech was $3,814.44 (as per their submissions at first instance)[^36]. I disagreed that the discretionary bonus component should not be taken into consideration in calculating loss of earnings as the starting point must be the income which the plaintiff actually earned before the accident, and this included the bonuses he earned at Blastech. It was only logical and reasonable that the loss of income suffered as a result of the injuries must necessarily take into account the bonuses as that represented the actual, determinable loss. The fundamental principle in assessing damages for tort is to put the plaintiff in the position he was in but for the tort. To not factor in the bonus component would result in an under-compensation. The plaintiff had, by the time of the accident, worked for Blastech for nine years[^37], and it was reasonable to expect that he would be accorded a variable bonus in the following year or two, barring unforeseen circumstances. In addition, by taking the average of the last three years of his annual income, which reflected a bonus component which varied between 2.61 months (in 2016) and 4.78 months (in 2015)[^38], this also took into account the possibility that the plaintiff would have earned a smaller bonus as a result of the vicissitudes relating to the company’s performance in a given year.

28     At ISS, the plaintiff drew a gross monthly salary of $2,475, including a shift allowance. The employment letter did not refer to the award of a discretionary bonus save for the one-month Annual Wage Supplement which was to be paid after 12 months of continuous service. In any event, the plaintiff only stayed at ISS for about eight months. The plaintiff hence incurred a loss of income between 3 July 2017 and 26 February 2018.

29     The plaintiff’s basic monthly salary at Commonwealth was $2,800, $73 less than his basic monthly salary at Blastech. I accepted the plaintiff’s testimony during the assessment hearing that he did not earn a bonus at Commonwealth at that point in time – on the first day of the assessment hearing on 15 May 2019, he had worked at Commonwealth for just over a year and was a relatively new employee at the company. He also had not worked a full year in 2019 and any variable bonus payable for 2019 would only have been declared as at 31 December for that year[^39].

30     Having determined that the plaintiff suffered loss of earnings over three continuous periods of time from 17 April 2017, I computed the loss of earnings for each of these periods.

##### (1)   Period of unemployment (17 April 2017 – 2 July 2017)

31     Both the plaintiff and defendant’s counsel took the monthly salary at Blastech (either the basic salary or the gross salary inclusive of bonuses) and divided it by 22 working days to arrive at the plaintiff’s daily wages at Blastech. In my view that was not the correct methodology as the plaintiff was not a daily-rated officer and was paid a salary for the month, and not for the number of days he worked in that month (assuming that he worked in the company for the full month) – see the pay slips for January and February 2017. My calculations were hence based on the average monthly salary of $3,814.44 which the plaintiff earned at Blastech (see paragraph 27 above). For completeness, I also agreed with the defendant’s counsel’s submissions that the plaintiff’s counsel’s calculations were also flawed when he stated that the loss of salary was for 77 days as “(t)he 77 days would include weekends and non-working days. Hence it is erroneous for the Plaintiff to multiply his average daily salary (per working day) across all 77 days especially since the average monthly salary of S$3,841.44 was divided across working days only”[^40].

32     The plaintiff was unemployed without pay for about 2.5 months. The loss during this period was as follows:

> (a)     Loss of salary: $3,814.44 x 2.5 months = $9,536.10

> (b)     Loss of employer’s CPF contribution: $9,536.10 x 0.17 = $1,621.14

> (c)     Total amount of loss: $9,536.10 + 1,621.14 = $11,157.24

##### (2)   Period of the plaintiff’s employment with ISS (3 July 2017 – 26 February 2018)

33     The plaintiff was employed at ISS for almost eight months at a gross monthly salary of $2,475. I noted that the defendant also submitted on the loss of income during this period based on a multiplier of eight months[^41]. The loss during this period was as follows:

> (a)     Loss of salary: ($3,814.44 - $2,475) x 8 months = $10,715.52

> (b)     Loss of employer’s CPF contribution: $10,715.52 x 0.17 = $1,821.64

> (c)     Total amount of loss: $10,715.52 + 1,821.64 = $12,537.16

##### (3)   Period of the plaintiff’s employment with Commonwealth (from 27 February 2018)

34     The plaintiff started work with Commonwealth from 27 February 2018. According to clause 10 of his employment contract with Commonwealth, a variable bonus was payable based on the basic salary as at 31st December for that year, subject to his work performance, attendance records and conduct[^42]. Although the plaintiff did not adduce evidence to show if he did or did not receive a variable bonus in his first year of employment, I gave the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and accepted that in his first 12 months of service with the company (ie between 27 February 2018 and 27 February 2019), he would not have received a variable bonus given his relatively short period of time with the company. From that, I deducted the amount of salary to take into account the “13th month bonus” which the plaintiff should have received as clause 9 of his employment contract stated that he was “entitled to an Annual Wage Supplement payment of one month basic salary for one completed year’s service between 1st January to 31st December”, which was pro-rated for employees who served “more than 3 months but less than 12 months’ of continuous service” based on “the completed months of service”[^43]. Clause 9 further provided that “employees who are not in the service of the Company or have tendered their resignation before 31st December for that year shall not be eligible for such payment”.

35     The plaintiff remained in the employment of Commonwealth at the time of the assessment hearing and the appeal hearing in February 2020[^44]. This meant that the plaintiff would have been entitled to the Annual Wage Supplement (AWS) for the first two months of 2019 as well. I hence deducted the AWS earned at Commonwealth between 27 February 2018 and 27 February 2019.

36     As for the period after the first 12 months of his employment with Commonwealth up to the date of the assessment hearing, I did not make any award for pre-trial loss of earnings because the plaintiff did not adduce any evidence in the form of salary slips, Notices of Assessment or any other evidence aside from his own, unverified testimony[^45] to support his claim that he did not receive a variable bonus or that he experienced a drop in his salary, bearing in mind the fact that his basic pay at Commonwealth was equivalent to that at Blastech. There was, in short, no proof of the plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earnings after February 2019 to the date of the assessment hearing. Special damages seek to compensate the plaintiff for losses already incurred and is capable of substantially exact calculation calculated – it was incumbent on the plaintiff to put forth the necessary evidence to support his claim to this end, but unfortunately he failed to do so.

37     The loss during this period was therefore as follows:

> (a)     Loss of salary: ($3,814.44 - $2,800) x 12 months = $12,173.28

> (b)     Loss of employer’s CPF contribution: $12,173.28 x 0.17 = $2,069.46

> (c)     Annual Wage Supplement (“AWS”) earned at Commonwealth between 27 February 2018 and 27 February 2019: $2,800 (_to be deducted_)

> (d)     Total amount of loss: $12,173.28 + 2,069.46 - $2,800 = $11,442.74

38     The total awarded to the plaintiff for pre-trial loss of earnings was **$35,137.14** ($11,157.24 + $12,537.16 + $11,442.74). Defendant’s counsel submitted that the appropriate deductions to take into account the income tax component should be made, citing the Court of Appeal decision in _Teo Sing Keng v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span> at \[42\] and \[49\]. While I agreed that the principles set out in that case were applicable, the defendant did not adduce evidence before me as to basis this was to be arrived at. Although counsel referred to the plaintiff’s Notices of Assessment in respect of his annual income in 2014 to 2016, which showed that a small amount of income tax was payable, I noted that in his Notice of Assessment for the 2018 Year of Assessment, which showed that the plaintiff’s annual income in 2017 was $31,139, no income tax was payable[^46]. There was also no evidence as to what the plaintiff’s annual income was in 2018 or 2019, and the amount of tax payable. In the circumstances, I did not make a deduction for income tax as there was insufficient proof on the quantum of the tax to be deducted for me to make an appropriate assessment of the same.

## Loss of future earnings

39     The defendant appealed against the Deputy Registrar’s award for loss of future earnings, submitting that there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff’s claim.

40     The principles relating to the award of loss of future earnings (LFE) and loss of earning capacity (LEC) to personal injury claimants, and the distinction between LFE and LEC, are well-established. As set out by the Court of Appeal in _Koh Chai Kwang v Teo Ai Ling (by her next friend, Chua Wee Bee)_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 610</span> at \[37\] and repeated in subsequent decisions (eg _Quek Yen Fei Kenneth (by his litigation representative Pang Choy Chun) v Yeo Chye Huat and anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 229</span> at \[103\]):

> Normally, damages on the basis of LFE are awarded when the injured party is unable to go back to his pre-accident employment and has to take on a lower paying job. In such a case, the loss will be calculated based on a multiplier and a multiplicand, the multiplicand being the monthly loss in pay and the multiplier being the appropriate period over which to compute the loss. In contast, where the injured party does not suffered (_sic_) an immediate wage reduction (eg, due to the compassion of the then employer: see _Smith_ (\[9\] _supra_) but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some point in the future and he may, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or getting an equally well-paid job in the open market, then the LEC would be the correct basis to compensate for the loss.

41     The Deputy Registrar correctly pointed out that an award for LFE is granted where the plaintiff is in employment at the time of the trial, but because of his injuries, is unable to earn as much as what he earned prior to the accident. The difference in earnings would form the basis of the multiplicand (see _Lee Wei Kong (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 4</span> at \[29\]). She then went on to award $144,000 for LFE, taking a multiplicand of $800 per month and a multiplier of 15 years. It was unclear how she arrived at a multiplicand of $800.

42     With respect, I was unable to agree with the Deputy Registrar’s assessment. First, the basic salaries at Blastech and Commonwealth were about the same ($2,873 at Blastech versus $2,800 at Commonwealth). Second, while I accepted that the plaintiff did not earn a bonus at Commonwealth in the first 12 months of his employment and should therefore be compensated for the loss of bonus during that period (see paragraph 34 above), it did not follow that he should be so compensated moving forward. As I mentioned earlier when dealing with the award for pre-trial loss of earnings, the employment terms with Commonwealth stipulated that in addition to the basic salary and the AWS, the plaintiff would be entitled to a variable bonus should it be declared payable for the year, subject to his work performance, attendance and conduct[^47]. Aside from the plaintiff’s assertion during cross-examination that he did not receive any bonus at Commonwealth[^48], there was no documentary or any other objective evidence to support or verify his claim. He did not tender any pay slips or the Notice of Assessment for the income earned in 2018 (like he did for previous years up to 2017) to evidence the non-payment of bonus or a fall in income. He did not call any representative from Blastech or Commonwealth to give evidence on the variable bonuses he used to receive and would or would not have received in future. Third, although the plaintiff testified that he was entitled to overtime pay at Blastech (_cf_ at Commonwealth – I noted that it was stated in his employment contract with Commonwealth that he was not entitled to _ex gratia_ (overtime) payment[^49]), no evidence was adduced by the plaintiff as to the amount of overtime pay he obtained monthly or yearly. The only pay slips from Blastech which were exhibited in the plaintiff’s bundle of documents were for the months of January and February 2017, which reflected that no overtime pay was earned (probably because he was still on hospitalisation for most of that period). No witness from Blastech was called to give evidence to shed light on the amount of overtime pay the plaintiff earned. Fourth, there was also no evidence produced to show the plaintiff’s prospects of future promotions and increments in his salary if he had stayed on at Blastech but for the accident. I should add that there was no evidence put forward by the plaintiff that his role as an Operations Executive at Commonwealth required him to carry and lift heavy loads such that it impeded his ability to perform this role at Commonwealth – brief mention of it was made as part of the plaintiff’s submissions in the Joint Opening Statement for the hearing below[^50] that his job at Commonwealth required him to “handle paperwork, coordinate the packing of and sometimes pack small items, for which he seeks assistance from his other colleagues since he still faces difficulty in carrying heavy items due to his injury” but no cogent evidence was adduced in the affidavits or during the assessment hearing to provide details of this claim or to support this submission.

43     The plaintiff bore the legal burden to prove that he was unable to earn the same amount at Commonwealth as he did at Blastech. He had to put forth sufficient objective facts or evidence to enable the court to reasonably make the assessment for the award of LFE. In this case, other than the plaintiff’s word, there was nothing else to support a claim for LFE. In short, there was no real assessable loss proved by evidence. I hence made no award under this head of claim.

## Loss of earning capacity

44     The plaintiff appealed agains the Deputy Registrar’s holding that there was no basis for the plaintiff’s claim for loss of earning capacity (LEC) as there was no evidence that the plaintiff was at risk of losing his present job at Commonwealth or that he would suffer a disadvantage in getting re-employed due to the injuries sustained.

45     In _Teo Sing Keng_ at \[40\], the Court of Appeal stated the following principles in determining an award for LEC:

> An award for loss of earning capacity, as opposed to an award for loss of earnings, is generally made in the following cases:

>> (a)    where, at the time of trial, the plaintiff is in employment and has suffered no loss of earnings, but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some time in the future, and may then, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well paid job; or

>> (b)    where there is no available evidence of the plaintiff’s earnings to enable the court to properly calculate future earnings, for example, young children who have no earnings on which to base on assessment for loss of future earnings.

46     LFE and LEC compensate for different losses and there is nothing in principle which bars a plaintiff from being entitled to claim for both LFE and LEC, provided that the necessary evidence is present (see _Shaw Linda Gillian_ at \[20\], \[24\]).

47     In _Shaw Linda Gillian_, the Court of Appeal amplified the principles in _Teo Sing Keng_ by setting out the test in determining if LEC should be awarded:

> It is trite that an award for loss of earning capacity (in the context where the plaintiff is currently employed) can only be awarded _if there is a substantial or real risk_ that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market. It is a cumulative test (at \[36\]).

48     Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that the cumulative test that the claimant (a) was at real risk of losing his **present** job (_emphasis mine_) and (b) be at a disadvantage in the open employment market because of his injuries before LEC could be awarded applied only if the claimant held on to his pre-accident job and not if he had changed his occupation after the accident. As such, the requirement in (a) did not apply in the present case as the plaintiff had already switched to another job. The decision of the District Court in _Pawel Gajewski v Lee Tong Lynn_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 153</span> (“_Pawel_”) was cited in support of this proposition.

49     The assumption that the requirement in (a) had to be met in every claim for LEC may have arisen from the use of the words “**present** job” _in Shaw Linda Gillian_ as it suggested that the job referred to was the one which the plaintiff held at the point in time of the trial or assessment hearing. That statement should be read in the context of the facts of the case – at the time of the assessment of damages proceedings, the plaintiff in _Shaw Linda Gillian_ was still in the same line of work and re-joined the employer she was with before the accident. In the later case of _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span>_, the Court of Appeal made it clear that the point of reference in determining if damages for LEC should be given was the job which the plaintiff held **before** the accident, not after. The plaintiff in _Lua Bee Kiang_ could not longer work as a carpenter after the accident and had to work as a cleaner, for which he was paid less. The court held that the argument that the plaintiff should not be awarded LEC as there was no evidence to show that he was at risk of losing his current employment as a cleaner was misconceived. It clarified that “(t)he question is not whether he is at risk of losing his current, post-accident employment, but whether he has been prevented from competing in the market for his pre-accident job” (at \[50\]).

50     The objective of tortious damages is to restore the plaintiff (at least in the monetary sense) to the position that he would have been but for the accident. I agreed with the plaintiff’s submission and the position in _Pawel_ that the requirement in (a) in paragraph 49 above was not applicable if the plaintiff had left the pre-accident occupation and taken on a different job post-accident. This must be so. Otherwise, in a situation such as that in _Lua Bee Kiang_, where the post-accident job was of a different nature altogether, and for which the plaintiff drew a lower salary, the plaintiff may be undercompensated if the award of an LEC was pegged to the “present” job instead of the pre-accident, higher paying job.

51     Applying the guiding principle in _Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[50\] to the case before me, there was no evidence to show that the plaintiff was prevented from competing in the market for his pre-accident job in the IT industry as an IT officer. While there was evidence that the plaintiff applied for jobs in the IT sector during his period of unemployment after he left Blastch and could only secure employment at ISS at a lower pay[^51], the medical evidence in respect of the permanent disabilities which the plaintiff suffered as a result of the injury did not suggest that the plaintiff was disadvantaged in the open employment market by virtue of those disabilities – I accepted the medical assessment and found that the plaintiff’s limited range of motion of his left shoulder (by 15%) was a continuing and permanent disability which impacted his ability to carry heavy loads. However, the plaintiff did not put forth any evidence to support the contention that the fact that he would have some difficulty carrying heavy loads would put him in at a disadvantage in competing for a position as an IT officer or that he could not secure an equivalent job in the open employment market. In this regard, there was no evidence led as to whether the role of an IT officer would invariably require the carrying of heavy loads or the carrying out of manual work. That the plaintiff was not able to find an equivalent job after he left Blastech did not serve as good evidence that he could not do so in future as the plaintiff was still recovering from his injuries at that point in time. In addition, the fact that the plaintiff needed to do so at Blastech was not sufficient evidence of the general position in the IT sector –the plaintiff was the sole IT officer in the company and was essentially a “one-man operation”. It would have been different if the plaintiff was in an occupation the very nature of which required manual labour, eg a storeman or a construction worker. This was not the case here, and an inference could not be drawn, in the absence of any evidence adduced, that an IT officer’s role would necessarily involve manual work.

52     The plaintiff’s appeal against the Deputy Registrar’s decision under this head hence failed.

## Conclusion

53     In summary, for the foregoing reasons, I made the following orders (on a 100% basis):

> (a)     In respect of DC/RA 90/2019, I allowed the plaintiff’s appeal in respect of his claim for pre-trial loss of earnings, which I assessed at a sum of **$**35,137.14 (on a 100% basis), with interest payable on this sum to be fixed at a rate of 2.67% per annum from the date of the accident to the date of the judgment (ie 25 August 2020). I dismissed the plaintiff’s appeal in respect of his claim for LEC.

> (b)     In respect of DC/RA 92/2019, I allowed the defendant’s appeal against the decision to award the plaintiff damages for LFE.

54     Each party succeeded on one substantive head of the appeal. The submissions and evidence raised by parties for all three heads of appeal were related and inter-connected. Many of the authorities submitted also covered the law for all three heads. In the circumstances, I ordered that each party bear his own costs of the appeal.
