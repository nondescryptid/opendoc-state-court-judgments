Criminal Law – Offences – Criminal force on public servant

Evidence – Unusually convincing standard – Corroboration

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9796/2020/01.\]

2 October 2020

### Principal District Judge Toh Han Li:

## Introduction

1       The accused claimed trial to the following charge:

> You….are charged that you, on 13 November 2017 at around 10.40am, at the entrance of Blk 357 Yung An Road #XXX, Singapore, did use criminal force on one Roslan bin Karap, an enforcement officer of the National Environment Agency and a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by kicking the said Roslan Bin Karap in the stomach with intent to deter him from discharging his duty as such public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008).

2       At the close of the trial, I delivered a brief oral judgment and acquitted the accused. As the prosecution has appealed against the acquittal, I now give the grounds for my decision.

## The Prosecution’s case

3       The prosecution called three witness. PW1 Roslan bin Karap (“PW1”) was the key prosecution witness. PW 2 Debbie Leong Jia Ling (“PW2”) was the current investigating officer. PW 3 Goh Toh Twee (“PW3”) was PW1’s team leader and supervisor.

### PW1’s evidence

4       PW1 was an environmental health officer with the National Environmental Agency (“NEA”). On the morning of 13 November 2017, he reported to PW2 in his NEA uniform, which consisted of a short-sleeved white shirt with the NEA logo imprinted above the left pocket, blue pants, and wore his NEA authority card around his neck.

5       PW1 was deployed to conduct house inspections at Block 357 Yung An Road. The accused was a resident of Block 357 Yung An Road #XXX (“the unit”) with her mother, Tan Geok Wah (“DW3”) and her elder sister, Ng Wan Ting (“DW2”).

6       When PW1 arrived at the unit, he testified that the right half of the gate of the unit was opened. He identified himself to DW3 by showing his NEA pass and requested for permission to inspect the unit. When he was denied access by DW3 into the unit, he inspected the plants outside of the unit with DW3.

7       During his inspection of the said plants, PW1 found evidence of mosquito breeding. He collected a sample and showed it to DW3. He then requested for DW3 to produce her particulars. DW3 refused to produce her particulars, but instead pleaded PW1 to “give a chance” and not issue a summons to her.

8       At that moment, PW1 testified that the accused was standing at the entrance to the Unit and looked fiercely at PW1. She held on to the left half of the gate with her right hand. She also lifted her right leg and rested it on the left gate. PW1 felt that the accused may attack him. He warned the accused not to touch him, and he took a step backwards.

9       PW1 testified that the accused then turned to her left, faced PW1 and kicked him with her right foot. PW1 testified that he felt the accused’s foot making contact with his stomach. DW3 then pulled the accused away from the door and further into the house. DW3 apologised to PW1 and she produced her particulars. PW1 informed the family that he would make a police report.

10     PW1 then left the unit and called PW2, his team leader and supervisor, on his mobile phone. He related to PW2 that he was kicked by a resident while conducting an inspection. PW1 was reluctant to lodge a police report as he believed that the accused was a school girl and did not want to affect her future prospects. However, PW2 instructed him to lodge a police report as it was the NEA protocol to do so.PW1 later lodged a police report (“P2”) on the same day. He also went for a medical check up as he was advised to do so by PW3 and was examined by Dr Sum Hung Wen. The prosecution did not call Dr Sum as a witness, nor did it produce the medical report of PW1. Both sides eventually agreed to admit Dr Sum’s medical report by consent as D7 without calling Dr Sum on the basis that Dr Sum was told by PW1 that he felt some pain during the instance of the assault and that there were no injuries sustained by PW1. The sample collected by PW1 was eventually confirmed by NEA to be mosquito breeding and DW3 was issued with a Notice to Attend Court on 29 November 2019 with a composition fine of $200 (“D10”).

11     During the cross-examination of PW1, the defence sought to impeach him with regard to portions of his police report. The defence also highlighted inconsistencies with the Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts and his evidence in court.

### PW2 and PW3’s evidence

12     PW2’s evidence was the current investigating officer of the case. She came on board as the investigating officer on 6 January 2020. Her evidence was more formal as she had taken photographs of the unit. She did not record any of the accused’s statements. She was questioned by defence counsel as to whether Dr Sum’s particulars had been given to the defence given that the prosecution did not intend to call Dr Sum as their witness.

13     PW 3 was PW1’s team leader at the NEA. He testified that in 2017 the NEA uniform was a white shirt short sleeve with collar, two pockets, blue pants and NEA logo on top left hand side of chest.

14     NEA officers had to put on the authority card on the chest with a lanyard when conducting inspections. Each morning, he would muster his officers to ensure that they were in proper attire, brief them and then deploy them to the respective areas for inspection.

15     The protocol for inspection was that the NEA officer would knock on the door, identify themselves, show their authority card and state that the purpose of visit was to detect mosquito breeding. They would need to gain permission from the unit owner to proceed with inspection, otherwise they would thank the owner and proceed to inspect another unit.

16     The NEA officer would inspect four areas, namely the living room, kitchen and master bedroom toilet and the corridor in front of unit.

17     When inspecting the corridor, they would have to knock on the door and invite the unit owner to come out and do the inspection, as the unit owner needed to be present as a witness if there was any finding of mosquito breeding.

18     If mosquito breeding was found, the unit owner would be informed. Samples would be collected with the unit owner as a witness and sealed in presence of the owner. The NEA officer would inform the owner that they would be bringing back the sample to the NEA laboratory for testing. If confirmed, the unit owner will be fined.

19     The NEA officer would require information from the unit owner to submit the information into the NEA system and he would ask for the unit owner to produce his or her identification card (“NRIC”).

20     If the unit owner refused to give particulars, the NEA officer would leave and bring the sample back. The NEA team leader would then search at the backend on who was the occupier, tenant or owner of unit through a property search.

21     If a NEA officer is assaulted, he should inform the team leader, go for a medical check up and then make a police report.

22     PW3 said that PW1 was a good officer on the basis that he would carry out advice given to him, and that there had been no disciplinary case against PW1 that he was aware of.

23     On the day in question, PW1 called him and informed him that he got kicked in the stomach. PW3 told him to go for a medical check up to see if he was alright, make a police report and then put up a statement of the incident.

24     PW3 testified that PW1 had told him he was conducting a mosquito inspection and there was breeding found. A young girl had kicked him in the stomach somewhere near the door. He said that he did not want to make a police report as he did not seem to have sustained any injuries. In view of the NEA protocol, PW3 said that he could not “sweep the matter under the carpet”, as it was to protect NEA officers when they were doing their duty.

25     After the phone call, PW3 spoke to PW1 at the office and asked him if he was alright as he was quite elderly. PW1 replied that he was alright.

## Submission of no case to answer

26     At the close of the prosecution, the defence submitted that there was no case to answer on the basis that PW1’s sole witness was completely unreliable, as his evidence in court was contradicted by the Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts and his own police report. The defence also asked the court to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution for failing to call Dr Sum as he was a material witness.

27     As the defence’s submissions of no case to answer turned primarily on the credibility of witnesses especially PW1’s testimony, I found that at that stage there was some evidence, not inherently incredible on the charge which merited the defence being called.

## The defence

28     The defence called three witnesses, namely the accused, her elder sister DW2 and her mother DW3.

### The accused’s evidence

29     At about 10.40am on 13th November 2017, the accused testified that she was sleeping in the bedroom with her mother. At that time she was 20 years old. When she heard the bedroom door open, her eldest sister DW2 came in to wake her mother DW3 up. She told her mother that someone outside wanted to come in to check their house. Her mother was worried that it could be a scam. There were mostly ladies at home then and they were sleeping. As such, her mother told her elder sister to ignore the person and to explain to the person that it was not convenient that day.

30     Her elder sister accordingly went out. At that time, the accused was still with her mother, sleeping in the bedroom. Her elder sister came back shortly and again woke her mother up. She said that the person was outside and started to check on their potted plants. She wanted her mother to go out to have a look.

31     Her mother then went out together with her elder sister. Her mother left with her elder sister and the accused continue to sleep in the bedroom. She continued to sleep in the bedroom, when she heard noises outside getting louder and louder. The accused wondered what was going on outside. As she was the one taking care of those plants outside, she thought she had better go out to check on what was going on.

32     She got up, opened the bedroom door, went out to look for her mother and elder sister. They were then at the main door. At that time, the left side of the gate where the handle was open. The accused explained that the handle would be the place where they opened the gate out and the lock was also at the handle side, and they would use the keys to open the lock on that side. They would never open the right side of the gate.

33     When the accused reached the gate, she saw her mother, her elder sister and PW1, and the three of them were talking loudly. The accused saw that PW1 was donned in a white shirt with his back facing them. She thought he was holding on to a flowerpot and he kept meddling with their flowerpots. Their flowers grew in in a plastic container. She did not know who the man was at that time. While PW1 was checking, her mother and elder sister were standing behind the gate and looking. The accused asked her elder sister in the Hokkien dialect as to what was happening. Her elder sister told her that PW1 had said that there were mosquitos in their flowerpots and that they would be given a fine.

34     PW 1 continued checking and when he completed his checking, he turned around. It was then that she noticed he was holding on to a small bottle in his hand. He did not say anything or offer any explanation. He then asked her mother for her NRIC. Her mother refused to give it to him. PW1 then turned aggressive in both attitude and tone. He used his torchlight and kept shining on to the bottle. He raised his voice and kept telling them that there was something inside.

35     The accused explained to PW1 in very broken English that she had just changed the water a day before and there could not have been anything inside. He kept emphasising that there was something inside. The accused then suggested to him that they could throw the flowers away and asked him if he could give them a chance. He refused to listen to her. The accused explained that this was the first time that such an incident had occurred. Her mother and elder sister also tried explaining to him, hoping that he will be able to give us a chance. As that was the very first time they had encountered such a matter they were all rather afraid. She said that they had tried to explain things to him but he simply refused to listen to their explanation and kept asking her mother for her NRIC. As PW1 refused to listen to their explanation the accused did not want to speak to him further and she decided to go back to sleep in the bedroom.

36     As she headed back, she then heard PW1’s voice behind her getting louder and louder and he kept asking her mother for her NRIC, so she decided to go back to sort things out with him. She wanted to talk things out with him, and went back with rather heavy steps. She was behind her mother and her elder sister. She wanted to take a step forward to talk things out with PW1 but her mother and her elder sister suddenly pulled her by her hand back, and she lost her balance. She fell backward and right leg came up to shin height. Her toes were slightly out of the gate but she was very sure that she did not kick him or even touch him. She was barefooted then. The accused also said that she had a medical condition in her right leg and would have cramps on the legs at times. She explained that her intention was solely to talk things out with PW1 and had no other thoughts.

37     After her leg came up, her mother asked her elder sister to bring her to her grandmother who was then at the living room and her elder sister did so. As her mother did not want to blow things up, she apologised to PW 1 and gave her NRIC to PW1. Before her mother gave him her NRIC, she asked for his work pass, it was then that he produced a card. The accused said that before PW1 produce his card, she did not know who he was. She was quite far behind when her mother wanted to give him her NRIC and her mother asked for his work pass, and it was then that she noticed him take out a card. But when he took out the card, he was waving his hand vigorously and then kept the card very quickly. As he was some distance away from the accused and given that she did not put on her spectacles, she did not have a clear view of PW1’s card.

38     The accused did not know who he was but she kept hearing him say that he was a police officer. As PW1 kept saying that he was a police officer that was what the accused thought he was, but in actual fact, she had no idea who he was. The accused said that like her mother, she was worried that he could be a scammer. After her mother gave PW1 her NRIC, the accused said that PW1 kept saying that he would be making a police report and that he could sue them.

39     The accused, said throughout this entire encounter, her intention was to simply talk things with him and she bore no other thoughts. She said that she was very sure that her leg did not kick or touch anything and at that point when her leg came up when her mother and sister put pulled her back, she did not know that he was NEA officer.

40     The defence also tendered the accused’s long statement (“D8”) and cautioned statement (“D9”).

41     In her long statement D8 the accused stated as follows:

> At that time, I was feeling upset and angry that he has messed with my flowers, and was also fierce and rude to my family members. I had only just woken up and had a bit of a temper. I tried talking to him as well, stating that I can throw the two potted plants away, but he would not listen to me. Both of us started talking louder and louder and I got more agitated.

> I was upset that he was being rude to Wan Ting and my mother, and that he was bullying my family members. I was feeling very angry and frustrated and I walked towards him and wanted to reason with him further. When my mother saw me walking towards the gate, she pulled me back. I then lost my balance and my leg went a bit higher. It also stretched out of the metal gate, but I do not think that I had kicked him.

> I had no intention to hurt the officer. I was feeling very angry and frustrated at that time and I was merely venting out my feelings as I was walking towards him. As I was very agitated, I had been stomping towards him and my mother had the wrong impression that I was walking towards him and wanted to hurt him. However it was not my intention.

42     In her long statement D8, she further added that “I _did not have the intention to fight the guy, and it was also quite impossible given the difference in size.”_

43     In her cautioned statement D9 she stated as follows:

> I didn’t kick the stomach of the NEA officer. I was restrained by my sister and my leg actually flew out of the gate but I didn’t kick him nor touch him. I didn’t think of hitting him and it was not my intention. I didn’t stop him from discharging his duty. His attitude was not good. When I was going back to my room, he was shouting that he was a police officer.

44     In court, the accused maintained that she did not have the intention to kick the accused, as it was her leg which came up involuntarily when she was pulled back but that there was no contact between her foot and PW1.

### DW2’s evidence

45     DW 2 is the accused’s elder sister.

46     She was working at home on the said day and at 10 40 am, she was working in kitchen when she heard an unfriendly voice saying “hello, hello!” loudly. She stood up and went to entrance of kitchen to take a look and saw PW1 at the main door shouting for her to go over.

47     At that time both sides of the gate were closed then. When DW 2 was half way there he shouted “come out come out!” and told her that the corridor had mosquitos and asked her to go out and take a look. She turned back to kitchen to retrieve key to open gate and PW 1 told her “faster , faster!”. She rushed back to kitchen and went back to open the left side of the gate.

48     She said that they would lock the top and bottom of the right gate without the handle and they seldom open that side of the gate. It was not possible for the side with handle to be closed while the other side open not possible as the side with the handle had to be opened before they could release the lock top and bottom. The left gate with the handle did not have a latch at the top and bottom.

49     When she was opening the gate, she noticed PW 1 was outside checking the flowers. She asked PW1 what happened and why there could be mosquitos, whereupon he took a plastic container in which they put their plants in and used a torchlight to shine into it. He asked her to take a look and she saw something moving and he told her that it was mosquito larvae and asked her if he could enter the house to check.

50     DW2 told PW1 to wait as she would ask her mother if he could be allowed to check the house.

51     As her mother was sleeping, she told DW2 to ignore the person as it was not convenient. DW 2 went back to the gate and PW1 that it was not convenient to enter the house.

52     PW1 was persistent in claiming that there was mosquito larvae in bowl. DW2 asked him how he could be sure about larvae without any laboratory check. He told her that that were mosquitos and that he would issue a fine.

53     Up till that point PW1 had not shown her any official identification.

54     DW 2 returned to the bedroom and told DW3 that she had to get up and asked her to come out. They both walked to door and DW 3 asked PW 1 what happened and why there was mosquitos.

55     DW 3 said that they had taken good care of the flowers and had changed the water daily but PW1 insisted that there were mosquitos and that he would give them a fine.

56     DW3 then suggested throwing the water away if there were mosquitos and to give them a chance as they had never committed an offence before and the water had been changed the day before.

57     At that point, the accused was woken up from her sleep, whereupon she walked over to DW2 and DW 3 and asked what happened. DW2 spoke to her in in the Hokkien dialect that PW1 had said that they had mosquitos and wanted to fine them.

58     DW2 testified that as PW1 did identify himself as a government official and as no identification was shown to her she did not know if he was a genuine government official.

59     DW 2 said that they tried to explain to him that water was changed a day before, and the accused similarly explained to him and asked why there were mosquitos.

60     The accused said that she could throw away the flowers and give them a chance and not issue a fine. PW1 insisted that he said could not, and that if everyone asked for a chance he need not work.

61     PW1 insisted that he would give them a fine. At that point, DW2 said that the accused stopped talking to PW 1 and went back to her bedroom to sleep.

62     PW1 was persistent in giving them a fine and asked for DW3’s NRIC. DW3 was not willing to give her NRIC, and told him that he could take down her block and unit number and that would be enough to know who the house owner was.

63     PW 1 then threatened them and said that he would report them from deterring him from his duty. DW 2 said that PW1 was very unfriendly, and showed an aggressive face and was shouting.

64     At that point the accused walked back and wanted to talk things out with PW1. As DW2 felt that he did not want to give them a chance and listen to them, she thought that it would not be necessary to speak to him further, and DW2 and DW3 then pulled the accused whereupon she lost her balance and fell backwards, with her right leg out of the door slightly. The accused was not wearing footwear. DW 2 said that the accused had had problems with leg and would suffer from pain and unsteady gait with the right leg being more serious. DW2 said that she was certain that the accused’s foot did not come into contact with anything and PW1 was some distance away from them.

65     When asked what DW2 thought the accused’s intention was, she said that the accused wanted to talk to him to give them a chance and as DW2 and DW 3 did not want to get her involved, they pulled her back.

66     At that point when the accused was pulled back, PW1 retracted a step backwards, and said he was an ex-police officer he knew the law and would make a police report. DW3 then instructed DW2 to bring the accused to the living room to look for her grandmother.

67     PW1 asked for DW3’s NRIC, whereupon DW 3 gave it to him and asked him for his identification card whereupon PW1 showed his identification card in a flash but they did not have a good look.

68     After DW3 gave PW1 her NRIC, he took out a small book in which he recorded her NRIC and used his phone to photograph it.

69     PW1 kept threatening them and saying that he was an ex police officer and would make a police report against the accused. As they did not want to blow things up they apologised and asked him not to make a police report against the accused.

70     On 15 January 2019, DW2 made a police report (“D11”) against PW1 for making a false report against the accused which caused her to be incorrectly charged for kicking her stomach when she did not do so.

### DW 3’s evidence

71     DW3 is the accused’s mother. On the day in question, she was in the bedroom sleeping when DW2 came into her bedroom and said that someone was outside their house and wanted to come into the house to check for mosquitos.

72     She told DW2 that she was sleeping and to inform the person outside that it would not be convenient for him to check. She then continued to sleep. Subsequently, DW 2 came in to say that the person outside said that there were mosquitos and wanted to give them a fine.

73     DW3 then went out with DW2 to the main door. At that time, the left gate with the handle was open, and the right gate with the unit number was closed. DW3 explained that the right gate without the handle was not open as there were locks on top and at the bottom which they would latch and never open. DW3 said that it was not possible for the left gate to be closed and the right gate open as they would open the left gate with the handle and not the other side.

74     DW2 asked PW1 what happened, and he said there was mosquitos found in the flowers and he would give them a fine. She told him that as they had maintained cleanliness of the area, it would not be possible to have mosquitos. PW 1 asked her to have a look but she did not go out. He then took the container to show her, and she could see black specks inside. PW1 said that that those black specks were mosquitos and he would give them a fine. DW3 asked how he could be so sure that it was mosquito breeding and he insisted in a loud and impolite manner that what was inside were mosquitos and that he would give her a fine.

75     DW3 asked if he could give her a chance and she could throw the water away and he said “no”. At that point the accused came out from the bedroom, asked DW2 what happened, and DW2 told her in Hokkien that PW1 has said that there were mosquitos among the flowers.

76     Up to that point, DW3 testified that PW1 had not shown her any identification at that time.

77     The accused tried to explain to him in poor English that she had just changed the water the day before it would not have been possible to have mosquitos

78     PW1 responded “no, no!” and that if everyone was to ask for a chance there would be no way for him to carry out his work. The accused then went back to the bedroom.

79     PW1 insisted that DW3 give him her NRIC, and she told him that he could take down my unit number. As she was the owner of the unit, she felt that taking the unit number would allow him to know the particulars if he was government officer. At that time, DW3 did not know who he was, as he was just there to check for mosquitos. PW1 asked DW3 to give her NRIC to him, otherwise he would report that she was deterring him from his official duty

80     At that point DW3 noticed the accused walking back. DW3 felt that since PW1 did not want to listen, they decided not to let the accused speak to him and both pulled her back. DW3 said that the accused always had a problem with right leg so when they pulled her back she lost her balance and almost fell. She fell backward and her leg was slightly lifted , her toes were out of the gate but she did not kick the person as there was a distance between her and PW1. She was not wearing footwear at that time. PW1 moved backwards, and said “you want to kick me, I will make police report!”. DW3 then asked DW2 to bring the accused to their grandmother who was in the living room.

81     As PW1 kept asking for her NRIC, and saying he would make a police report to arrest the accused as he knew the law, DW3 felt that she had no choice but to give him her NRIC.

82     She asked for his identification card and PW1 produced a card, but as he was waving it she could not see it clearly. She said that before he showed the card she did not that he was from the NEA but she knew that he was checking for mosquitos

83     PW 1 took out his handphone to take a photograph of her NRIC and her unit number. He took out a small booklet to record particulars and said that he would make a police report to arrest the accused.

84     DW3 felt that she should apologise to him, as she did not want to blow the matter up. PW1 then returned her NRIC and left and while leaving he said he would make police report to arrest the accused.

85     On 15 January 2019, DW3 made a statutory declaration to the effect that PW1 had made a false report against the accused (“D12”).

86     Throughout the incident, DW3 testified that the accused’s intention wanted to reason things out with PW1 and she was very sure that there was no contact between the accused’s leg and PW1.

## The court’s decision

### The elements of the offence

87     In _Goh Ang Huat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span>, Yong CJ held at \[12\] that in order to secure a conviction under s 353 Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008), the prosecution would need to prove that:

> (a)     the victim of the criminal force was a public servant;

> (b)     the accused used criminal force on such public servant;

> (c)     the accused used criminal force on the public servant when the latter was in the execution of his duty as a public servant.

88     It was not in dispute that PW1 was a public servant, namely a NEA officer executing his duties to detect for mosquito breeding at the material time. The key issues in dispute was whether the accused intended to use criminal force on PW1 and whether she did in fact use criminal force on him, by kicking him in the stomach. The key element of the charge was that the accused “did use criminal force on one Roslan bin Karap, an enforcement officer of the National Environment Agency and a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant…”, although the prosecution had further particularised the charge as “to wit, by kicking the said Roslan Bin Karap in the stomach with intent to deter him from discharging his duty as such public servant”.

### The unusually convincing standard

89     As the prosecution’s case rests solely on the evidence of PW1, it had to be “unusually convincing”. In _PP v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 2</span> (“_PP v GCK_”) the Court of Appeal held at \[104\] that the “unusually convincing” standard applies to the uncorroborated evidence of a witness _in all offences_ and not just sexual offences, where such evidence forms the sole basis for a conviction. In principle, the standard applies regardless of whether the witness is an eyewitness or an alleged victim.

90     In _PP v GCK_ the Court of Appeal explained further on what “unusually convincing” meant at \[88\], \[90\] to \[92\]:

> The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is **“so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence”**: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that **“a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’**” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]).

> …

> Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard **entails that the witness’s testimony** **_alone_** **is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt**: see _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[73\].

> In a sense, the “unusually convincing” standard is not a “test” at all, but rather, a _heuristic tool_. It is a cautionary reminder to the court of **the high threshold that the Prosecution must meet in order to secure a conviction, and of the anxious scrutiny that is required because of the severe consequences that will follow from a conviction**. That scrutiny is directed towards **the sufficiency of a witness’s testimony**, which is inextricably linked to the ultimate inquiry of whether the case against the accused person has been proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\].

> Rather, its aim is to ensure that the trial judge has an awareness of **the dangers of convicting the accused person on uncorroborated evidence**, and that he or she (as well as an appellate court) undertakes a rigorous and _holistic_ assessment of the evidence.

### Was there corroboration?

91     In the present case, there was no _objective or independent_ corroboration of PW1’s evidence. In _AOF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> the Court of Appeal held at \[114\] that _subsequent repeated complaints by a complainant cannot, in and of themselves, constitute corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement of “unusually convincing” testimony_.

92     The prosecution relied on s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, Rev Ed 1997) (“EA”) as PW1 had reported the matter to PW3 immediately after the incident. Section 159 EA reads:

> In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.

93     In _Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] SGHC 155</span> Yong CJ held that although s 159 EA had the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nonetheless bear in mind the fact that _corroboration by virtue of s 159 EA alone was not corroboration by independent evidence_ and that it would thus be dangerous to equate this form of corroboration with corroboration in the normal sense of the word: at \[47\] and \[49\]. As such, the subsequent reporting of the incident by PW 1 to PW3 or the filing of a police report does not constitute objective or independent corroborative evidence so as to dispense with the requirement of PW1’s evidence having to be unusually convincing.

### Evaluating PW1’s testimony

#### Whether PW1’s evidence was consistent with his police report and the Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts

94     The salient parts of the Case for the Prosecution as set out in its Summary of Facts were as follows:

> On 13 November 2017 at about 10.40am, Roslan was performing enforcement checks as an officer with the NEA. He was in his uniform. He approached the Unit and spoke to one Tan Geok Wah ("Tan"). Roslan identified himself as a NEA officer and requested entry to inspect the unit as part of his duties. Tan refused to grant Roslan entry.

> Roslan then inspected the plants along the corridor of the Unit and detected signs of mosquito breeding. He then requested Tan to produce her particulars. Tan refused to do so.

> **The accused (Tan's daughter) who was within the Unit approached the entrance of the Unit and began arguing with Roslan.** At this point, Roslan was standing outside of the Unit, while the accused and Tan were standing inside of the Unit. There were two halves to the gates of the Unit, and one of the gates was ajar.

> **Roslan noticed that the accused was behaving aggressively. He warned the accused not to touch him and stepped backwards. The accused raised her right leg to kick Roslan and her right foot came into contact with Roslan's abdomen.**

\[emphasis added\]

95     In the police report (“P2”) filed by PW on the same day of the incident it is stated:

> On the same date at around 1040, I requested from the owner of the unit #XXX that I need to make a check on the unit. However they refuse as a result I proceed to check on the corridor as they are keeping plants outside their unit corridor and also to supervise me during the check to make sure I do not tempted with anything. **As a result the daughter of the unit owner came to supervise me while I make my check on the plants.** After making a check, I inform the owner enforcement action will be issue reason being that I detected breeding in one of the plastic container. However, they informed me to closed an eye and help them to pour away the water from the pot. I informed them that this is not right and I have to issue a summon to them.

> **However, during the conversation, one of the owner daughter gets agitated and use her leg and kick onto my stomach.** The owner of the unit ask me not to make any police report. I then inform my supervisor about this matter and they instructed me to proceed make a police report. I wish to add that I do not sustain any injury and they instructed me to proceed to make a police report. **I wish to add that I do not sustain any injury and this is the first time such an incident happened**.”

\[emphasis added\]

96     The upshot of the Case for the Prosecution was that after mosquito breeding was detected in the corridor of the unit, PW 1 informed the family that enforcement action would be taken, DW3 refused to give him her particulars, the accused began arguing with PW1, who then behaved aggressively and used her leg to kick PW1’s stomach.

97     In court, PW1’s evidence was it was DW3 who he first engaged and accompanied in the inspection of the flower pots in the corridor[^1].

> Q    Other than the mother, was there anybody else around you who witnessed your inspection?

> A    I’m not too focus with others, **because I only together with the mother in inspection time.**

> Q    So, can you remember if there was anybody else around other than the mother?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Yes, you remember that there was someone else around you?

> A    There was one lady, but I’m not focused with it.

> Q    Sorry. Can you repeat? You are not focus, what?

> A    With her.

\[emphasis added\]

98     In his police report, he stated that it was one of the unit owner’s daughters who accompanied him for the inspection where he stated that “As a result the daughter of the unit owner came to supervise me while I make my check on the plants.” This version in his police report was in fact consistent with the defence’s version that it was DW2 alone (and not DW3) who accompanied him for the check in the corridor.

99     The evidence in chief of PW1 on the lead up to the alleged kick was as follows[^2]:

> Q    Can you describe \[the accused’s\] expression please?

> A    She looked very fierce and disagree with me.

> Q     **Did this girl say anything to you?**

> A     **No.**

> Q    Did you say anything to this girl?

> A    Yes. **When she looked fierce, I---I know that she’s going to do something on me. I warned her**\---

> ….

> A:     **And I warned her not to touch me or else, I will make a police report.**

> Q     **Mr. Roslan, why did you warn the girl not to touch you at that moment?**

> A     **I know if she did that, she’s committing an offence.**

> Q    What---what do you mean by “when she did that”?

> A    If she do something, like that she attack me, then she’s committing an offence.

> …..

> A     **After I warned her, I know that she’s going to go against me. I moved one step backward. Then in split second, she kicked on my body**.

\[emphasis added\]

100    His evidence that there was no conversation or argument with the accused was maintained under cross examination[^3]:

> Q    So you are saying that **both the case for the Prosecution, which I referred you just now, as well as your own police report which stated that that there was a conversation are both incorrect.** Do you agree?

> A    Disagree.

> Q     **You are saying that there was no argument at all, correct?**

> A     **No argument, yes.**

101    PW1’s evidence in court that there was no prior conversation, argument or aggressive behaviour between him and the accused, whereupon she suddenly kicked him with her right bare foot presented an oddly truncated version of events. According to PW1’s own evidence in court, all that the accused was doing at that time was standing at the gate, facing sideways and looking fierce without any threatening or aggressive gesture. I therefore find it hard to comprehend how PW1 could say on that basis that the accused was going to do something to him and proceed to issue a warning not to touch him or he would make a police report.

102    The prosecution submitted that the discrepancies in PW1’s evidence before or after the assault had no direct bearing on the issue of the assault. For example, the defence had submitted that there were some discrepancies between PW1’s evidence on where exactly he had detected the mosquitos and his police report (whether it was discovered in a plastic container as stated in the police report or a flower pot according to his evidence in court). While the details of where the mosquito breeding was found may not be directly relevant to the incident, discrepancies relating to the events immediately before the incident (especially the accused’s conduct) were _highly relevant_ as they would explain the circumstances that led to the incident and support either the prosecution or defence’s version of the actual incident.

103    In my view, PW1’s evidence in court undermined the prosecution’s case as set out in the Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts and his own police report. The discrepancy was that in his police report there was an argument (she had asked him to give her family a chance but he refused) which escalated from her behaving aggressively and eventually kicking him with presumably the “intent to deter him from discharging his duty as such public servant”. Yet in court PW1 maintained that there was no such argument with the accused.

104    There was a dispute between the prosecution and defence as to whether the left or right half of the gate to the unit was open. PW1’s evidence was that the right gate was open while the left gate with the handle was closed and that the accused was resting her right hand and right leg on the left gate with the handle. The accused, DW2 and DW3’s evidence was that the right gate was never opened as that was the one with they would lock this gate with the latches at the top and bottom. DW2’s evidence was that it was not possible for the left gate with handle to be closed with the right gate open as the left gate with the handle had to be opened before they could release the lock top and bottom. The left gate with the handle did not have a latch at the top and bottom.

105    Considering PW1’s evidence that the right gate was open with the left gate closed, I note from photograph D6 it could be seen that there were no latches on the left gate to hold it in place thus allowing to swing freely. This would have made it unstable for the accused to have rested her right hand and right leg on.

106    I therefore had my doubts on PW1’s evidence that the left gate with the handle was closed with the right gate open and was more inclined to accept the defence’s version that the left gate was open and the right gate with the latches was closed.

107    Further, PW1’s evidence in court was that the accused had her right hand and right leg propped on the left closed gate and _had to turn her body to the left_ and extend her right leg to kick him. In other words, PW1’s evidence was that the accused was not even facing PW1 before the alleged kick. It is therefore hard to comprehend the basis of his evidence in court when he said “_After I warned her, I know that she’s going to go against me”_ given that the accused was _facing away from PW1_ with no threatening movement or aggressive gesture prior to the alleged kick. Further, PW1’s evidence in court was also at odds with the Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts at paragraph 7 which stated that _“Roslan noticed that the accused was behaving aggressively”_ where he then warned her not to touch him and stepped backwards.

108    The prosecution submitted that the word “conversation” in the police report which states “… during the _conversation_, one of the owner daughter gets agitated and use her leg and kick onto my stomach” did not necessarily refer to a conversation with the accused and PW1 and instead referred to a conversation between PW1 and the _other occupants of the unit._ This position was however, contrary to the Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts which stated that “**_The accused (Tan's daughter)_** _who was within the Unit approached the entrance of the Unit and_ **_began arguing with Roslan_**_.”_

109    The Case for the Prosecution would have been formulated on the evidence (including the police report as the First Information Report) which the prosecution sought to adduce and prove at the trial. In this regard, section 169(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68) reads:

> 169.—(1)    The court may **draw such inference as it thinks fit** if —

>> (c) the prosecution … puts forward a case at the trial which differs from or is otherwise **inconsistent with the Case for the Prosecution….**

\[emphasis added\]

110    The Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts would have been aligned with PW1’s police report but had been contradicted by PW1’s evidence in court which simply focused on the alleged kick from the accused and that there was no prior conversation, argument or aggressive gesture from the accused. If, as the prosecution submits, that PW1’s argument was only with the other family members, why would a similar warning not be issued by PW1 to them as well and why only to the accused who done nothing prior to the alleged kick other than looking fierce?

111    As such, with no prior conversation, argument or aggressive gesture from the accused, I find that his evidence in court his having to issue a warning to her not to touch him and threatening her with a police report if she did so implausible. To this end, I find that there was a reasonable doubt as to PW1’s evidence that the raising of her right bare foot was a manifestation of her intent to kick him and deter him from discharging his duty as a public servant. Further, on PW1’s own evidence in court, it is not clear what purpose would be served by the accused kicking him with her bare foot and how that would deter him from executing his duty from reporting them for mosquito breeding. I therefore find that PW1’s testimony in court was materially inconsistent with his police report and the Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts, specifically in relation to the accused’s conduct immediately before the alleged kick. It was also internally inconsistent as to the circumstances that led to the alleged kick by the accused.

#### Whether PW1’s evidence was consistent with his medical report

112    In the medical report D7, the examining doctor Dr Sum Hung Wen recorded what PW1 told him:

> According to the patient, he had **pain during the instance of the assault**. However **during the consultation, there was no longer any abdominal pain. Physical examination did not reveal any bruising.** His abdomen was also **soft and non-tender on palpation.** Patient **declined analgesia as he was no longer in pain.**

\[emphasis added\]

113    In his evidence in court, PW1 gave a different account and stated that he _did not feel pain_ when the accused kicked him[^4]:

> Q    And where did she---where did her right leg kick you at?

> A    On my stomach.

> Q     **Did you feel any pain?**

> A     **No.**

> Q     **Did you feel any contact?**

> A     **Yes.**

\[emphasis added\]

114    Under cross-examination he maintained that he felt contact but no pain during the assault. The inference is that PW1 had either greatly exaggerated or misrepresented his condition to Dr Sum by claiming that he was in pain at the time of the assault. PW 1 clearly understood the distinction between contact and pain from the medical report where he told Dr Sum that he felt pain during the kick but “_no longer felt abdominal pain”_ during the consultation and that he “_declined analgesia as he was no longer in pain_.” This material inconsistency between PW1’s evidence and his account to Dr Sum in his medical report raises _a reasonable doubt as to whether there was even contact_ by the accused’s leg with PW1. This possibility that there may have no contact with PW1 meant that the actus reus was not made out and supported the defence’s version that the accused’s leg came up involuntarily but was pulled back with no contact to PW1.

#### PW1 dealings with the family

115    In his evidence in chief, PW1 testified that he had warned the accused before the alleged kicking[^5]:

> A:    And I warned her not to touch me or else, **I will make a police report**.

\[emphasis added\]

116    After the alleged incident, he said that he would lodge a police report[^6]:

> Q    So you said that---sorry. The mother said sorry to you after the kick, is that correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q     **And what was your response?**

> **A**      **I said I will make a police report.**

\[emphasis added\]

117    Yet later on in his evidence in chief and under cross examination, he shifted his stance and said that he did not want to make a police report[^7]:

> Q    What was your response to Mr. James telling you to lodge a police report?

> A    My respond? **My first thought that I don’t want to proceed with any police case**. What I mean, to lodge a police report. But I was advised and informed that this is the protocol that I have to make a police report.

> Q    And you told this to Mr. James?

> A    James advised me to make a police report and I then went to the Jurong Police Station and make a police report.

> ….

> Q    Did you tell Mr. James you did not want to make a police report?

> A    Yes, I did.

> Q     **Why did you not want to make a police report for this case?**

> A     **My first thought that she’s a school girl. I believe that by making a police report, she will be in the bad list for her future.**

> \[emphasis added\]

118    Under cross-examination he contradicted his earlier evidence in chief[^8]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

**I put it to you that you also said you wanted to lodge a report against my client. You may agree or disagree.**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Agree.**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Agree or disagree?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**First, disagree**. **After I get permission from---instruction by my supervisor then I did. I never, uh, said any that I’m going to lodge a police report**.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

**So, you are saying that you never told the mother that you were making a police report, is that correct?**

 |
| 

A

 | 

**Correct. I never said that I will make police report.**

 |

  
  

119    When questioned on his police report he maintained that he did not say to the owner that he would be making a police report[^9]:

> Q    And you said in your police report, “The owner of the unit asked me not to make any police report.” Correct?

> A    Correct.

> Q     **And so, you are saying that without you having said that you were making a police report, the owner of the unit was asking you not to make any police report?**

> A     **She did appeal to me not to make police report.**

\[emphasis added\]

120    Despite having stated in his evidence in chief on no less than two occasions that he would make a police report, under cross-examination PW1 then states that _“I never said that I will make police report.”_ and his stance was that he had to be directed by PW3 to do so as that was the NEA protocol.

121    The vacillations within PW1’s own evidence in court on whether he was going to make a police report were not trivial as he sought in court to portray himself as an even tempered person in his dealings with the family and was therefore reluctant to make a police report against the accused. Yet, his evidence in chief that he had warned the accused not to touch him or else he would make a police report and telling the accused’s mother that he would make a police report immediately after the incident was closer to the defence’s version of events that he was rude and aggressive towards them for being uncooperative.

#### Whether the accused knew that PW1 was a NEA officer

122    The defence contended that the accused did not know that PW1 was a NEA officer and therefore could not have intended to deter him from discharging his duty. The prosecution contended that accused must have known that PW1 was some form of enforcement officer and PW1 and PW3’s evidence was that the NEA pass was hanging on a lanyard around his neck and that he was attired in a NEA uniform.

123    The prosecution also took issue with the fact that the accused made no attempts to verify PW1’s identity even if they may have had doubts about his identity. The prosecution also pointed out to inconsistencies in DW2 and DW3’s evidence in this regard that their not knowing that PW1 was a NEA officer was implausible. In my view, what is critical is the accused’s state of mind as to PW1’s status and not that of DW2 and DW3. In this regard, it was not in dispute that PW1 did not show the accused his NEA pass (his evidence was that he only showed DW3 when the accused was no present). The accused testified that she did not know that NEA officer wore uniforms or that they had their authority card with them[^10]. She said that she did not ask for PW1’s identification card as her mother and sister were around at that time[^11]. This was the family’s first encounter with a NEA officer and they were afraid and did not know want to do[^12]. Further, the accused, DW2 and DW3’s evidence was that PW1 was rude and aggressive in demanding for DW3’s NRIC and insistent on fining them for mosquito breeding.

124    The evidence of PW3 was that the sample taken has to be confirmed as positive by the NEA laboratory before enforcement action can be taken[^13]:

>   
| 

Q

 | 

Is it right to say then that if the NEA officer explains what will happen to the sample, enforcement action will be taken against the unit owner?

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

What will happen to the sample? What do you mean by that question?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, because the sample has to be confirmed---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

the mosquito before enforcement action can be---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

**Alright, sample---**

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**taken against---**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

**has to be confirmed by who?**

 |
| 

A: Witness:

 | 

**By the lab,---**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Alright.

 |
| 

A:

 | 

**by the NEA lab.**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

**Yes.**

 |

  
  

125    PW 3 confirmed that PW 1 could not, on his own accord, decide that a summons would be issued before confirmation by the NEA laboratory[^14]:

> Q     **So, it is not possible to determine at the point of collection of the samples that a summons should be issued, correct?**

> A     **Correct.**

> Q    And so, if Mr. Roslan had immediately if---I’m---I’m saying if he did this, immediately---

> A    Yah.

> Q    at the unit owner’s house, informed them that a summons would be issued, this is not in accordance with the procedure you have describe, correct?

> A    Not exactly. It depends on the situation. I disagree with that.

> Q     **So again, Mr. Goh, basically at the point where the samples are collected, the officer cannot of his own accord decide that a summons would be issued, correct?**

> A     **In his own accord, yes, he cannot decide.**

> Q     **So, if he told the unit owner right at that point that he would have to issue a summons to the---then this is essentially not within his powers, correct?**

> A     **Correct.**

\[emphasis added\]

126    PW1’s evidence in court was that he informed the family that a summons would be issued without reference to any confirmation by the NEA laboratory[^15]:

> Q    Did the mother give you her particulars?

> A    Yes.

> Q    What did you do after you received the mother’s particulars?

> A     **I jot down the particulars. Return back the particulars. And I said I will proceed with summon actions**.

\[emphasis added\]

127    DW2’s evidence also verified this[^16]:

> Q    So, it is a fact that he found mosquito breeding. Do you agree?

> A    I agree. **But he was so certain even before the lab check was conducted**. **So, I find him very unprofessional.**

\[emphasis added\]

128    PW1’s evidence that he told the family that he was proceeding with the summons action without the NEA laboratory’s confirmation supported the defence’s version that he was perturbed by the family’s refusal to cooperate in denying access to the unit and providing particulars. He admitted that this was the first time he had met with such resistance in his 10 years of working experience[^17].

129    The accused explained her reaction to PW1[^18]:

> A    No. Because we kept trying to explain things to him, but he refused to listen to us. I also tried to explain to him, but he refused to listen at all. He showed bad attitude and tone. That was when I was a bit upset.

> Q    So, you felt that the officer was being unreasonable to your mother and sister?

> A    That’s right. Like---like I say he kept refusing to listen to us. Ins---instead of listening to our explanation, he kept saying that he will give us a fine. And he persistently asked for my mother’s IC without any explanation as to why he required the IC.

130    As such, given that PW1’s insistence on issuing the summons was not accordance with the NEA protocol and the fact that he did not show the accused his NEA pass prior to the incident, I did not find the accused’s explanation that she did not know for certain if he was a government or a NEA official at the material time as implausible.

#### Did the accused intend to kick PW1?

131    Even if the accused knew that PW1 was some form of government official, the gravamen of the defence was that the accused never intended to kick PW1 and therefore could not be said to have intended to deter him from discharging his duty.

132    The prosecution submitted that DW2 and DW3’s evidence that they pulled the accused back was implausible as she could not have been behind them in order for her to be pulled back. The prosecution also pointed discrepancies between the accused cautioned statement (D9), her long statement (D8) and DW2’s long statement (D11) and DW3’s statutory declaration (D12) as to whether it was DW3 alone who pulled the accused back or both DW2 and DW3. The prosecution submitted that the fact that DW3 apologised to PW1 after the incident pointed to the “high likelihood that the accused did kick PW1.”

133    Yet, it was not in dispute (with which PW1 agreed) that the accused was pulled back minimally by DW3, although there was some dispute as to whether DW2 also pulled her back together with DW3. Even so, both sides agreed that _the accused was pulled back._ The issue was _when_ this pulling back took place. PW1’s evidence was that the pulling back of the accused took place immediately _after_ the kicking, whilst the defence case was that she was pulled back and her leg involuntarily came up[^19]:

> Q    What happened after the young girl kicked you in the stomach?

> A     **The mother pulled her away.**

> Q     **How did the mother pull her away?**

> A     **By pulling her hands.**

\[emphasis added\]

134    At the same time, PW1’s evidence is that everything happened quickly[^20]:

> Q    And you said that this action took place just in a flash, correct?

> A    Yes.

135    The Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts described the incident as “_The accused raised her right leg to kick Roslan and her right foot came into contact with Roslan's abdomen.”_ The Case for the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts focus on _the raising of the accused’s right leg_ was more akin to an attempt but the charge and PW’1 evidence in court made it clear that was the prosecution’s case that he was in fact kicked. As I had discussed above, the material discrepancy between the medical report and PW1’s evidence in court calls into question if there was even contact in the first place.

136    The prosecution’s submission that there is no motive for PW1 to falsely implicate the accused misses the point. The defence’s case is that when PW 1 saw the accused’s raising her right leg he _could have been mistaken_ that the accused was trying to kick him because he felt she was agitated. The discrepancy between his evidence in court and his medical report also raises the issue of whether there was contact in the first place.

137    The defence’s case was that the accused’s right leg coming up involuntarily with no contact and PW 1 actually conceded this point under cross-examination when the defence put to him that he could have been mistaken that the accused had kicked him[^21]:

> Q    I put it to you, Mr. Roslan, that **you could have been mistaken that my client had kicked you** because you felt that she was agitated. You may agree or disagree.

> A     **Yes.**

\[emphasis added\]

138    Notwithstanding PW1’s subsequent reversal of his earlier response under re-examination, this was a material internal inconsistency within PW1’s evidence which goes to the heart of the case and supported the defence’s version of events.

### Was there a reasonable doubt within the prosecution’s case?

139    Quite apart from the “unusually convincing” standard, the prosecution ultimately bears the burden of proving the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. In _PP v GCK_, the Court of Appeal explained at \[126\] and \[129\] that:

> The fundamental rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is considered hallowed precisely because it rests upon the bedrock principle of the presumption of innocence, which is the very foundation of criminal law. **As a practical measure, the rule reduces the risk of convictions arising from factual error.**

> …

> The principle of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is simply that upon a consideration of all the evidence presented by the Prosecution and/or the Defence, **the evidence must be sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the offence with which the accused person is charged**…

> \[emphasis added\]

140    The Court of Appeal in _PP v GCK_ held at \[134\]-\[135\] that there were two instances when a reasonable doubt would arise at, namely a reasonable doubt may arise from _within the case mounted by the Prosecution_ or a reasonable doubt or that a reasonable doubt may arise on the _totality of the evidence_.

141    The Court of Appeal further stated at \[136\] and \[139\]:

> As we recently explained in _Mohd Ariffan_ at \[113\], given that the legal burden lies on the Prosecution throughout a trial, as part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce sufficient evidence to establish the accused person’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a _prima facie_ basis. One example of a failure to do so would be where, after the Defence has been called, **there are discrepancies in the accused person’s testimony, but there remain significant inconsistencies** **_in the Prosecution’s case_** **that nevertheless generate a reasonable doubt. In such a situation, the court would be obliged to acquit the accused person**. \[136\]

> …..

> **Given these material discrepancies** **_within the Prosecution’s case_** **, the court reasoned at \[113\] that the mere fact that weaknesses in the accused person’s defence might support some aspects of the Prosecution’s case was not enough to secure a conviction**. \[139\]

\[emphasis added\]

142    I first consider whether a reasonable doubt has arisen from _within the case mounted by the Prosecution._

143    As highlighted earlier, the key issues in dispute was whether the accused intended to use criminal force on PW1 and whether she did in fact use criminal force on him, by kicking him in the stomach.

144    With regard to PW1’s credibility, I considered whether there was a need to make a specific ruling on whether PW1’s credit has been impeached pursuant to the defence’s application. In _Loganatha Venkatesan and others v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 904</span> the Court of Appeal held at \[55\]:

> It should be remembered that impeaching the credit of a witness is not confined to previous inconsistent statements made to the police under the CPC. Statements made by a witness in other situation, verbal or written, which is inconsistent with or contradictory to his evidence given in court, upon proof of such statements, may be used by counsel for the opposing side to impeach his credit. **A witness’ credit may also be impeached by reference to evidence the witness has given at the trial, say in the examination-in-chief, which is inconsistent with or contradictory to his evidence in cross-examination.**

\[emphasis added\]

145    The Court of Appeal further held at \[56\]:

> In our opinion, there is **no requirement that the trial judge must, at any stage of the trial, make a ruling on whether the credit of the witness is impeached. All that is required is that the court must consider the discrepancies and the explanation proffered by the witness for the purpose of an overall assessment of his credibility**. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that an impeachment of the witness’s credit does not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: see _PP v Somwang Phatthanasaeng_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 2 SLR(R) 414</span> (HC) and _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ (\[52\] _supra_). **Thus, regardless of whether his credit is impeached, the duty of the court remains, that is, to evaluate the evidence in its entirety to determine which aspect to believe**.

\[emphasis added\]

146    I respectfully agree with the Court of Appeal that there was no need to make a specific ruling on impeachment with regard to PW1. Rather, I have considered the internal and external inconsistencies in PW1’s evidence and the explanations he has offered for the inconsistencies in arriving at an overall assessment of his credibility.

147    I found that PW1’s evidence court on the events immediately before the alleged kick raised a reasonable doubt as to whether there was intent on the accused’s part to use criminal force and whether there was even contact between her leg and him, for the reasons explained above that PW1’s evidence had _significant and material inconsistencies internally and externally_ which rendered his evidence in court implausible and unreliable. On internal consistency, I had earlier set out the difficulties with and the logic of his evidence in court as to how the accused came to kick him and the basis (or lack thereof) for his telling her not to touch him or his telling her that he would make a police report.

148    To this end, his evidence was internally inconsistent that she had intended to use criminal force on him when he initially conceded under cross-examination that he could have been mistaken that the accused has kicked him because she was agitated.

149    As highlighted, the external evidence such PW1’s medical report and his police report contradicted key portions of PW1’s testimony in court. This goes to the heart of the prosecution’s case and raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused’s leg came into contact with PW1 which would have been fatal to the charge.

150    I have also that there was no independent and objective corroboration of PW1’s evidence. Not only is PW1’s police report not corroborative, it is _materially inconsistent_ with PW1’s testimony. As for PW3’s evidence, he had no personal knowledge of the incident and was merely repeating what PW1 had told him, and if PW1 could have mistaken that the accused was kicking him, relating this to PW3 does not add anything to the evidence and in fact simply compounds the matter. I had earlier highlighted that PW1’s conduct in informing the family that he would issue a summons was inconsistent with PW3’s testimony that there was a need for this to be first verified by the NEA laboratory.

### Evaluating the defence’s case

151    As I have found a reasonable doubt has arisen from within the case mounted by the Prosecution, there would be no need to consider if there is also a reasonable doubt on the totality of the evidence. The Prosecution also cannot rely on any weaknesses or inconsistencies within the defence case to shore up what is lacking in its own case. This was reiterated by the Court of Appeal in GCK who stated at \[140\] that:

> Once the court has identified the **weakness internal to the Prosecution’s evidence**, in the **absence of corroborative evidence that can militate against this weakness such that the Prosecution’s evidence as a whole can still prove the case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt**, **weaknesses in the Defence’s case cannot ordinarily shore up what is lacking in the Prosecution’s case to begin with** (see \[139\] above).

152    Nonetheless, for completeness I shall deal with the prosecution’s submission on what they viewed as weaknesses in the defence witnesses’ evidence. The prosecution’s submission on the weaknesses in the defence’s case can be summarised into the following four areas:

> (a)     The accused knew that PW1 was a public servant in the execution of his duties;

> (b)     The defence version of the accused being pulled back was implausible;

> (c)     The accused did not have any medical condition in her right leg; and

> (d)     DW3 apologised to PW1 because the accused had in fact kicked him,

153    In terms of whether the accused knew that PW1 was a NEA officer, I have dealt with this point at \[122\] to \[130\].

154    On whether the accused’s evidence on being pulled back by DW2 and DW3 was implausible given her insistence that she was behind DW2 and DW3, the accused had explained under cross-examination as follows[^22]:

> A    I wanted to talk things out with him, that was why I went back and I walked to---behind my mother and my eldest sister. **I wanted to take a step forward to take \[sic\] to him and my mother and eldest sister could have mistaken my action or perhaps they had some thoughts in their mind which I do not know. They pulled me all of a sudden in which I lost my balance.** I fell backward and my leg was lifted, my toes were slightly out of the gates.

\[emphasis added\]

155    The accused also demonstrated in court how she was pulled back[^23]. The key point is that when the accused was planning to take a step forward, she was then pulled back by DW2 and DW3.

156    Although the prosecution had highlighted inconsistencies in the defence’s evidence and their previous statements as to whether DW2 also pulled her back together with DW3, as I had stated at \[132\] to \[134\], it was not in dispute (with which PW1 agreed) that the accused _was pulled back_ minimally by DW3, and the dispute was _when_ this occurred, whether _after_ the alleged kick or _before_ the alleged kick.

157    As for the accused’s medical condition in her leg, as no medical evidence was admitted on this (the defence had sought to admit the medical report without calling the maker of the report and I declined to admit it[^24]), I did not make any finding that she had such a medical condition in her right leg. That said, as I have stated at \[112\]-\[114\], the discrepancies between PW1’s evidence and his medical report raise the issue of whether there was even contact with the accused’s leg and his stomach. This is supported the accused’s version of events that her leg came up involuntarily without any contact with PW1.

158    On the prosecution’s contention that DW3 apologised to PW1 because the accused had in fact kicked him, I was of the view that this was a neutral fact. DW3 explained that she had apologised because PW1 had wanted to make a police report against the accused and not because she had in fact kicked him[^25]:

> A    I am very sure Wan Ping did not kick him because her toes was only slightly outside. And there was a distance---there was a distance between Wan Ping and that person. He was standing in the middle of the corridor.

> Q    Now, Mdm. Tan, after you pulled Wan Ping backwards, you did apologise to the officer, correct?

> A    Apologise to him, well, that was when he said he wanted to make a police report to arrest my daughter.

159    DW3 explained that she apologised to PW1 as she did not want to blow up matters[^26]:

> Q    So, earlier on in Cross-Examination, initially you said you---you had apologised when the man said that he would make a police report. Subsequently, you then said, no, you did not apologise. Can you clarify whether you eventually apologised to the man?

> A    I---I did. I did eventually apologise to him because I did not want to blow up the matters and since that’s what he thought things will be then I apologised first.

160    Finally, I would add that I was alive to the fact that DW2 and DW3 had an incentive to give evidence in the accused’s favour as they were the sister and mother of the accused respectively. The fact remains that material aspects of their evidence was in fact supported by parts of the prosecution’s evidence. For instance, the fact that it was DW2 who supervised him in the corridor (PW1’s police report being consistent with DW2’s evidence) that there was a conversation and argument between the accused and PW1 (from the Case for the Prosecution6’s Summary of Facts, the police report and PW1’s insistence in proceeding with the summons), PW1’s evidence that the accused as pulled back by DW3 (albeit after the alleged kicking) and that he told the accused and her mother that he was going to make a police report.

161    All these pieces of evidence supported the defence’s case that there was no contact between the accused leg and PW 1 or intention by the accused to kick PW1 and that PW1 could have been mistaken that the accused was attempting to kick him.

## Conclusion

162    In view of the various internal and external inconsistencies in PW1’s evidence on crucial parts of the prosecution’s case as highlighted above, I did not find his evidence unusually convincing or compelling. In fact, I find PW1’s evidence implausible and unreliable and that it would be unsafe to convict the accused on the basis of his testimony. The prosecution has failed to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and I accordingly granted the accused a discharge amounting to an acquittal.
