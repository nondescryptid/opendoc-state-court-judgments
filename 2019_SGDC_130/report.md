\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9108/2019/01.\]

25 June 2019

### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## Introduction

1       The accused, who was unrepresented, claimed trial to a charge of failing to provide his urine specimen without reasonable excuse, which is an offence under section 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185)(“MDA”). In view of the accused’s prior conviction for a “long term” (LT-1) offence, he was liable for enhanced punishment under s 33A (2) of the MDA for an LT-2 offence.

2       One other charge for failing to report for urine test and another charge for possession of drug utensils were stood down pending the conclusion of the trial.

## Background

3       On 13 May 2019, I found the accused guilty and convicted him of the s. 31 (2) MDA charge at the conclusion of the trial. He then pleaded guilty to the two proceeded charges for failing to report for urine test and possession of drug utensils.

4       He was sentenced to a total of 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. He is appealing against his conviction on the s. 31 (2) MDA charge only. I now give my reasons for my decision.

5       The accused is presently serving sentence.

## The Charge

6       The Charge against the accused is set out below -

**_DAC-915535-2017_**

_You are charged that you, on 8 May 2017, between 5am and 11am., at Changi General Hospital, in Singapore, did fail, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of your urine within such time as may be required by police officers not below the rank of sergeant, namely, Sergeant Muhammad Fazli bin Zailani and Woman Staff Sergeant Wee Xue Ting, for urine tests to be conducted under s 31 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)._

_And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 12 July 2011, in District Court No. 25, vide DAC14982/2011, convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, to wit, morphine, under s 8(b)(ii) and punished under s 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) with 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## The Offence

7       The offence of failing to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse is described in section 31 of the MDA as follows:

“(1)  Any officer of the Bureau, immigration officer or police officer not below the rank of sergeant may, if he reasonably suspects any person to have committed an offence under section 8(b), require that person to provide a specimen of his urine for urine tests to be conducted under this section.

(2)    A person who fails, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of his urine within such time as may be required by any of the officers referred to in subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence.”

8       The punishment for such offence is provided under s 33A of the MDA (relating to “Punishment for repeat consumption of specified drugs”) as follows:

“(2)  Where a person who has been punished under subsection (1) \[for an LT-1 offence\] is again convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b) or _an offence of failure to provide a urine specimen under section 31(2)_, he shall on conviction be punished with —

imprisonment of not less than 7 years and not more than 13 years; and

not less than 6 strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.”

(emphasis added)

9       In essence, an accused person with a prior LT-1 conviction is liable for enhanced punishment for an LT-2 offence if he subsequently commits an offence of failing to provide a urine specimen without reasonable excuse.

## The Undisputed Facts

10     The accused was stopped by Police Officers from the Singapore Police Force on 8 May 2017 at about 12.45am at the void deck of Block 803, Chai Chee Road, Singapore. The accused was asked for his particulars by the police officers. He provided a NRIC number which did not belong to him. Upon further questioning of the accused, the police officers realized that the accused had a stack of medical certificates, and also found an NRIC number “XXX” on the medical certificates. It was noticed that the NRIC number of the medical certificates did not tally with the NRIC number that the accused had provided. The police officers then carried out a screening done on the NRIC number “XXX.” It was discovered that the person bearing the said NRIC number was wanted under a Police Gazette for failing to report for urine test. At this point, the accused then admitted that the said NRIC number was his own NRIC number. The accused was then arrested for failing to report for urine test and for being suspected of having consumed a specified drug. The following items were also seized from the accused :-

one burnt aluminium foil; and

one rolled up paper.

11     The accused was then brought to Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations. Subsequently, he was brought to the Changi General Hospital (“CGH”) on the same day. At about 4.56 am, the accused urinated in his pants on his own in a holding room at CGH.

12     On the same day between 5.00AM and 11.00AM, police officers from the Singapore Police Force required the accused to provide a specimen of his urine. The accused was also warned that the failure to provide a specimen of his urine was an offence under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”). The accused did not provide a specimen of his urine to the police officers when required to do so during this specific period.

13     At about 1.30pm on the same day, the accused had passed urine on his own accord.

## Issue for court’s determination

14     The accused did not deny that he did not provide his urine specimen to the CNB and police officers. Therefore, the only issue is whether he had a reasonable excuse for not doing so.

## The Prosecution’s Case

#### (i)   Evidence of key witnesses

15     The Prosecution’s evidence against the accused is summarised as follows.

16     The accused had claimed trial to a charge of failing to provide a urine specimen as required by the police officers under Section 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. In a sense, this is a straightforward case insofar as legal issues are concerned. Ordinarily, the court would go through both the Prosecution and the Defence evidence in some detail. However, in this case, since the accused had elected to remain silent when his defence was called, I will proceed therefore to spend some time going through the Prosecution evidence instead. I will return to the issue about the accused having elected to remain silent later in the course of this judgment.

17     The court had heard the evidence of 15 witnesses over a 6-day trial. The accused’s defence appeared to be that he could not pass urine as required by the police officers due to a urine disorder stemming from his cervical spine injury. The accused also made various allegations against the police officers.

18     The central plank of the Prosecution evidence was that when he was directed to do so by various police officers the 8th May 2017, the accused did not provide his urine specimen between 5:00am and 11:00am at Changi General Hospital. PW2 SGT Muhammad Fazli had required him to provide his sample. The accused merely said that he could not do so and did not say anything else. Again, when SGT Fazli had handed over the urine taking duty to his colleague, PW3 W/SSGT Wee Xue Ting, she testified that she had also directed the accused to provide his urine specimen, and the accused did not give his urine specimen. The accused also did not provide a reason for his failure to do so. Other evidence given before the court indicated that throughout the course of PW3’s Wee duty, the accused was offered water on multiple occasions, and each time he had refused drink the water that was offered without giving a specific reason. It was submitted that the oral testimony given by these 2 key police officers was largely substantiated and corroborated by documentary evidence tendered as contained in the Police Station Diary P2. P2 contained entries written by both PW2 SGT Fazli and PW3 W/SSGT Wee detailing the various occasions when the accused had passed urine on his own. P2 also contained the entries when the accused did not pass urine when directed to give a urine sample, when the officers had administered the warning to him and also when water was offered to the accused.

#### (ii)   Forensic evidence tendered

19     The Prosecution submitted that PW8 Matthew Ong who was a HSA analyst, had conducted a forensic examination of dark green underwear and a pair of blue jeans (P10) belonging to the accused. The HSA report P9 indicated that urine was likely to be present. The dark green underwear and the pair of blue jeans were the clothing worn by the accused on 8 May 2017 when he had passed urine into his clothes suddenly. The clothing items were subsequently seized and handed over to PW14 IO Muhammad Zulyadi for sending over to HSA for analysis. The accused did not dispute that the underwear and jeans were the ones seized from him on 8 May 2017.

#### (iii)   Statements of accused

20     The Prosecution also tendered the accused’s long statement (P14) under Section 22 CPC which was recorded by SGT Dominic, a CNB officer on 8 May 2017 at 5.45PM. The accused did not challenge his statement as he had stated that the statement was given voluntarily. The statement was therefore admitted into evidence. The contents of the statement will be discussed later in the judgment. I note here that in paragraph 5 and 7 of the long statement, the accused had stated that he had consumed _“panas_” about 2 to 3 days earlier.

#### (iv)   Accused able to pass urine on same day

21     Before the court, the Prosecution also adduced evidence and submitted that the accused had passed urine on his own, on 2 occasions on 8 May 2017 itself. The 1st occasion was at 4.56am on the same day of 8 May 2017. The accused passed urine while still wearing his underwear and pants while in the holding room in CGH. This was observed by PW2 SGT Fazli who had testified that the accused was seated in a wheelchair and handcuffed to it while facing the wall, when he suddenly peed in his pants. The accused was advised to stop so that the arresting officers could procure his urine. He did not stop but continued urinating. PW2 Fazli then verbally warned the accused to provide his urine sample for procurement, but the accused ignored him and continued sleeping.[^1] The Prosecution had submitted that this incident was also recorded in the Police Station Diary (Exhibit P2) at S/N 02 and was also corroborated by the accused’s s 22 CPC long statement at paragraph 3 where he had confirmed that he urinated in his pants.

22     Evidence was also led by the Prosecution that the 2nd occasion was at 1.30pm also on 8 May 2017. On this occasion, the accused provided a urine sample on request by PW5 Dr Maria Christina Racho Arroyo (“Dr Christina”), an A&E doctor of CGH. The witness PW3 W/SSG Wee had confirmed that she was present when the accused provided a urine sample to the doctor at 1.30pm. The witness stated that both herself and her partner had brought the accused to the toilet. The witness also clarified that although she was not physically in the toilet, when the accused came out with her partner, they had in their possession a bottle of urine sample.[^2] Dr Christina had also confirmed this and she also gave evidence that the accused was able to pass urine spontaneously on his own at 1.30pm on 8 May 2017. Further, a sample of his urine was also sent to the laboratory to check for any infection. The result had come back negative.[^3]

#### (v)   Accused also able to pass urine on other occasions

23     Aside from the two instances above which showed that the accused was able to, and in fact, had passed urine on his own on 8 May 2017, the Prosecution also adduced medical evidence to show that the accused was able to pass urine on his own _on other occasions_:

(i)     Dr Christina had issued two medical reports dated 16 May 2017 (Exhibit P4) and dated 14 September 2017 (Exhibit P5) stating that the accused was able to pass urine unaided and on his own and was certified to pass urine on 8 May 2017;

(ii)     PW13 Dr Teo Jin Kiat, a doctor in the Urology department of CGH, had issued a medical report dated 25 July 2018 (exhibit P15) stating that the accused was able to pass urine “on his own” as claimed by him on 8 May 2017. This meant that the accused did not require the insertion of a urinary catheter to drain out his urine, and had passed urine on his own at 1.30pm on 8 May 2017.[^4]

#### (vi)   Close of Prosecution case

24     The Prosecution closed its case after the evidence of its last witness PW15 Dr Shi Yi Yun. Dr Shi was a medical officer working at the A & E Dept. of Changi General Hospital. She was on the night shift on 7 May 2017 from 9.00pm till 7.00am on 8 May 2017. Dr Shi had examined the accused when he was brought in to CGH for a physical examination. Her evidence was that her physical examination of the accused is largely normal. Dr Shi did not find evidence during the physical examination that could explain the accused’s difficulty passing urine or his incontinence.[^5]

### The Defence’s Case - Accused elects to remain silent

25     The accused did not make a submission of no case to answer at the close of the prosecution case. I therefore ruled that there was a case to answer for the accused.

26     I administered the standard allocution to the accused and called upon him to enter his defence. _The accused elected to remain silent._

27     The trial was then concluded without any evidence from the accused or other defence witnesses being called to give evidence.

#### Extra time given to the accused to make his closing submissions

28     I then invited parties to make written closing submissions for consideration before the court gave its verdict. Being mindful that the accused was unrepresented, I decided to give the accused more time to prepare his written closing submissions. The case was accordingly adjourned for 5 weeks for parties to make their written closing submissions.

## Closing submissions

#### (a)   Written submissions by Prosecution

29     In summary, DPP Lim had submitted that the accused’s claim that he had a urine disorder was contradicted by the medical documentary evidence tendered before the court and also the testimony of 7 different medical doctors who had testified in court on the issue. It was also submitted that the accused had been inconsistent in his account of his alleged urine disorder given to the CGH doctors. DPP Lim also submitted that the accused’s claim that his statement had been inaccurately recorded by CNB officer SSGT Dominic Chen was untrue. DPP Lim also submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn against the accused as he had elected to remain silent rather than give his defence to the charge and also for not raising his defence in his cautioned statement.

#### (b)   Written submissions by Accused

30     The accused had elected to remain silent when his defence was called. The accused did however make written closing submissions. Here, I was mindful that he was unrepresented and unschooled in the law. I therefore did give the accused some leeway in hearing his written closing submissions. The accused essentially repeated many of the points he had raised during his earlier cross-examination of some of the Prosecution witnesses. He submitted that PW1 SGT Terence Chong, PW2 SGT FFazli and PW3 WSSGT Wee Xue Ting who were the police escorting offers were not telling the truth in giving their evidence, especially with regard to the procedures they had carried out while escorting the accused and asking for his urine specimen. The accused also submitted that the HSA Report (P 9) prepared by HSA analyst Matthew Ong (PW8) indicating the presence of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) was inconclusive and further that the procedure used for testing had resulted in contamination. He also submitted that the statement recorded by CNB officer SSGT Dominic (PW12) was a lie, it was made up by the recorder and was a farce. Further, the accused also generally submitted that the medical evidence was in his favour especially that of Dr Teo Jin Kiat (PW13) and that his cervical spine injuries were the reason for his inability to pass urine on 8 May 2017.

## Evaluation of evidence

#### Findings by court

31     As the accused had elected to remain silent, there was no evidence from him for the court to consider. The accused did not call any defence witnesses either. In essence, the court in evaluating the case against the accused, had absolutely no evidence given by the accused as his defence to the charge against him.

32     As indicated above, the accused had elected to remain silent when called to give his defence. I should add here that although he had engaged in limited cross-examination of some of the prosecution witnesses, he did not mount a proper defence at trial. Therefore, the court can only infer from his occasions of non-existent, or on other occasions, limited and mostly irrelevant cross-examination, that his defence to the charge was that he had a urine disorder.

33     I therefore carefully considered the accused’s written closing submissions. Even here, the accused essentially repeated what he had said during his limited cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses during the trial. There was no attempt made to deal with and rebut the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The accused even had to be reminded several times by the court not to repeat the same allegations again. As an example, during the trial itself, the accused had demanded that the prosecution should make available the body worn camera (“BWC”) footage worn by the arresting Police officers and also to provide the CCTV footage at Bedok Police Station/CNB Interview Room. For completeness, I should mention that this issue had already been clarified by DPP Lim through the IO, PW14 SGT Zulyadi. PW14 Zulyadi had given evidence and testified that the BWC footage of the arresting Police officers no longer existed as the footage is always deleted one month after a recording of an incident. PW14 further testified that the Bedok Police Station/CNB Interview Room does not have CCTV camera at that location. [^6]

34     With the above background in mind, I proceed now to deal with the specific issues raised by the accused in his written closing submissions.

#### Accused’s written closing submissions

#### (i)   Points 3 – 8

35     The accused had submitted in his written submissions at Points (3) to (8) that PW1 SGT Terence Chong, PW2 SGT Fazli and PW3 WSSGT Wee Xue Ting who were the police escorting offers were not telling the truth in giving their evidence, especially with regard to the procedures they had carried out while escorting the accused and asking for his urine specimen. In my judgment, these 3 witnesses had given a clear and consistent account of what had happened during their duty on 8 May 2017 at Changi General Hospital. Their testimony was also not complicated, in the sense that it was just a straightforward account of how the accused had repeatedly refused to drink the water as provided and stating also that the accused had refused to provide his urine sample between the key times of 5:00am to 11:00am as reflected in the charge. Both PW2 and PW3 had also separately testified that they had administered the warning to the accused on the consequences of not providing his urine sample and both times he had refused. I note that this is actually documented in the Police station diary (P5) and in one of the entries, the accused had even signed against it. Contrary to what was alleged by the accused, I did not find that PW1, PW2 and PW3 had contradicted each other in any material way in their separate testimonies given to the court.

36     I find therefore that the 3 witnesses gave a clear and candid account of the events that happened on 8 May 2017. I therefore reject the accused’s submission on this issue and find that all 3 witnesses gave a truthful account.

#### (ii)   Points 10 – 12

37     The accused had also submitted at Points (10) to (12) that the HSA Report (P 9) prepared by HSA analyst Matthew Ong (PW8) indicating the presence of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) was inconclusive and further that the procedure used for testing had resulted in contamination.

38     Here, the accused appeared to suggest that the HSA analyst PW8 Matthew Ong had given evidence that it was “_difficult for him to give a likelihood of how common it is (sic) that THP is the most abundant protein present in normal urine and is produced by kidneys_.” With respect, this is a misunderstanding of the technical evidence of PW8. What was actually stated by PW8 was that THP is the most abundant protein present in the normal urine. Also, in his Report (P9), it states at paragraph 8 that the exhibit was analysed for the presence of the constituents of urine and the presence of a constituent of urine, THP, indicated that urine could be present. And in a footnote at 10A of P9, PW8 Ong stated that THP is the most abundant protein present in normal urine and is produced in the kidneys. What the accused had cited in his written submissions was noticeably only a small part of the Notes of Evidence. In my view, the accused had failed to consider the whole context of the answer given by PW8.

39     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the quoted text above of the accused’s written submission was actually the answer of PW8 that was in response to a question by DPP Lim as to how likely it is that “this alternative sources” of THP would be likely in this case. [^7] I agreed with DPP Lim that seen in this context, PW8 was giving an account of where THP could originate from _other than urine._ And PW8’s response was to the DPP’s question of how likely is it in this case that these other sources would have featured. PW8 had then in reply gone on to state that without any background study, it was difficult for him to provide such a likelihood assessment. I noted however, that PW8 had also stated that logically “_it’s difficult for someone with the clothing of this kind to come from, for example, kidney related problems such as a kidney tumour or amniotic fluid that is present in a pregnant woman and other foetal urines_”.

40     Again, I note that the accused had further submitted that the HSA Report P9 should not be accepted as the testing process for his pants and underwear that formed the basis for the Report in P9 was contaminated. However, for reasons known only to himself, _the accused had declined to cross-examine PW8 during the trial, let alone on this specific issue of contamination._ This I found to be surprising. In any case, it was not open to the accused to now put forward rather belatedly, the issue of contamination in his closing submissions following the _Rule in Browne v Dunn_. I had no difficulty therefore in not accepting the accused’s submission that the testimony of PW8 was inconclusive or that the exhibit P9 was to be excluded as the testing process was contaminated.

#### (iii)   Point 15

41     Another submission made by the accused at Points (15) to (16) was that the medical evidence was in his favour, especially that of Dr Teo Jin Kiat (PW13). He also submitted that his cervical and spine injuries were the reason for his inability to pass urine on 8 May 2017.

42     In my judgment, the accused appeared to be labouring under a palpable misunderstanding of the medical evidence that had been introduced in court. The doctors had all testified, including the A&E doctors PW5 Dr Christina and PW6 Dr Aaron Ang who saw the accused on the day itself, that he was able to pass urine on his own. Further, there was also objective evidence as PW6 Dr Aaron Ang had an ultrasound scan done on 8 May 2017 to ascertain whether there was actually urine in the accused’s bladder and whether there was any obstruction to the urine outflow.[^8] The results of the ultrasound scan showed that the accused’s bladder was not distended at the material time of the scan at 7.30am on 8 May 2017. This was a clear indication that there was urine in the accused’s bladder at that time, but the bladder was not too swollen, which indicated that the bladder was not in distress.[^9] There was also no obstruction detected in the ultrasound scan. Dr Arron Ang had also confirmed that there were no abnormalities with the accused’s bladder based on the ultrasound scan.[^10] I find that there was nothing ambiguous in this testimony which was clear and also corroborated by an independent ultrasound scan report. I therefore accepted Dr Aaron Ang’s evidence in its entirety.

43     As for the accused’s cervical spine injury being the cause for his inability to pass urine, the independent medical evidence indicates to the contrary. Dr Arron Ang also provided a medical report dated 6 July 2017 (exhibit P7). He gave clear evidence that it was his view that the accused’s urinary symptoms were _not consistent_ with his previous cervical spine injury.[^11] Dr Aaron Ang was candid enough to state that this was his impression based on the physical examination findings. He went on to explain further that that if the urinary symptoms were related to the accused’s cervical spine injury, there would be associated signs and symptoms like limb weakness and limb numbness and an abnormal anal tone. Dr Aaron Ang testified that the accused did not complain of any of these symptoms.[^12] I pause here to note that Dr Ang’s evidence is also consistent with that of PW15 Dr Shi who testified some 4 months later as she was previously unavailable to testify due to overseas commitments. Dr Shi had testified in similar vein that she did not find any evidence of a neurological condition, or physical obstruction or abnormal anal tone or other conditions during the physical examination of the accused that would have explained his .self-reported issues. Dr Shi was clear and unequivocal in stating that “_So, basically_, _my physical examination is largely normal_. _I didn’t find any, uh, evidence on the physical exam that can explain his difficulty passing urine or his incontinence_.[^13]

44     For completeness, I should also add that the accused had referred in his closing submission to his episode of acute retention of urine (ARU). This assertion of the accused was also dealt with by Dr Shi. She had testified that this diagnosis is based on the accused’s subjective complaint. At the same Dr Shi had also stated that she “Uh, and _objectively, I didn’t find anything, uh, significantly---ly abnormal_ “ [^14].

45     To rule out any other specific medical complaint that may have prevented the accused from providing a urine specimen, the Prosecution had also called an orthopaedic specialist to give his expert medical opinion. In this regard, PW7 Dr Nicholas Lim Sern Han (“Dr Nicholas”), a doctor in the orthopaedic department of CGH, had issued a medical report dated 28 June 2018 (Exhibit P8). Dr Lim gave evidence that it was “unlikely” that the accused’s orthopaedic condition affected his ability to pass urine on 8 May 2017. Dr Lim testified that the accused had sustained a cervical fracture and finger fracture on 19 February 2017. Dr Lim also testified that based on the result of the physical examination and the CT scan, it was unlikely that his cervical fracture caused him to have difficulty in passing urine.[^15] Dr Lim had also explained that if the accused’s cervical fracture had caused an impairment with his urinary function, he would have presented with weakness or numbness in the upper and lower limbs instead of just an isolated urinary retention. But this was not the case with the accused according to Dr Lim.[^16] Furthermore, the results of the digital rectal examination also showed that the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder function were not affected.[^17] The results of the accused’s CT scan also showed that “_this is unlikely to have caused his acute urinary retention._” Dr Lim further explained in considerable detail that this meant that the accused’s cervical fracture was healing and he was unlikely to have suffered a spinal cord injury.[^18] This in turn meant that the accused’s cervical injury did not affect his spinal cord[^19] In turn, this meant that because there was no evidence of any spinal cord injury which may potentially affect the nerves that control the bladder function,[^20] Dr Lim emphasized this and confirmed that the accused’s cervical injury _did not likely affect his ability to pass urine on 8 May 2017._

46     I pause here to observe that in the light of such clear and detailed medical evidence by an Orthopaedic doctor commenting specifically on the assertion by the accused that his cervical fracture injury had resulted in him being unable to pass urine on the key date of 8 May 2017, it would be entirely reasonable to expect that the accused would have been eager to vigorously cross-examine Dr Lim on his findings and conclusions. Strangely, while the accused did briefly cross-examine Dr Lim, it was only on the issue of the dates of his missed orthopaedic appointments and whether Dr Lim was aware of the dates of these missed appointments and also that his family members had tried to change the dates of these review appointments.[^21] With respect, I did not see the relevance of the accused’s missed orthopaedic appointments or that his family members were trying to change the dates of these review appointments. I was therefore left to consider whether this was a case of a missed opportunity by the accused or was it a tacit admission on the part of the accused that Dr Lim’s evidence was clear and unimpeachable. I came to the conclusion that it was a case of the latter.

#### (iv)   Point 16

47     In relation to the extensive medical evidence tendered before the court, the final challenge by the accused was over the testimony of PW13 Dr Teo Jin Kiat. The accused had in his closing submissions at point (16) stated that Dr Teo had confirmed that he had voiding dysfunction and therefore “_even if we go around the bend with regard to my difficulties to urine, the urologist had diagnosed me and his report has proved that my complaint is genuine._” Again, the accused has misunderstood the purport of the medical evidence before the court. The doctors from the urology department of CGH, PW11 Dr Luo and PW13 Dr Teo, had both testified that the accused was able to pass urine on his own on 8 May 2017. In the case of Dr Teo, while the medical report dated 15 February 2018 (exhibit P13) stated that the accused had “voiding dysfunction”, it was clear from the testimony of both Dr Luo and Dr Teo that this was a broad term used for patients who complain of urinary problems and where the doctors are unable to find a cause.[^22] I noted from their oral evidence before the court that such a diagnosis was inevitably premised on self-reporting and that doctors are generally not trained to be able to tell if a patient is malingering or not.[^23] It was also conceded by the doctors that there is no objective way to verify if such self-reported symptoms are true. In the final analysis, I took the view that Dr Teo’s evidence as contained in the medical report dated 25 July 2018 (Exhibit 15) stated unequivocally that the accused was able to pass urine “_on his own”_ on 8 May 2017. To confirm this position, I had also questioned Dr Teo on the apparent contradiction as contained in his earlier report P13 which indicated that the accused’s previous heroin abuse could have affected his ability to pass urine. Dr Teo whereupon clarified that he should have made his position clearer in P13. Dr Teo then went on to add that even though voiding dysfunction _could_ have affected his ability to pass urine, in the present case there was “no doubt” that he was able to pass urine on his own on 8 May 2017. I find that Dr Teo’s testimony was consistent with what he had stated in his medical report P15 of 25 July 2018. In particular, the following extract from P15 is significant as Dr Teo had stated that “…_the_ **_patient_** **_did not pass urine on demand at 10am_** _and he_ _subsequently passed urine_ **_on his own at 1.30pm_** _on 8 May 2017_ _in the A&E.”_

48     In summary, the medical evidence of even the Urology doctors from CGH, just like the earlier evidence of the CGH A&E and Orthopaedic doctors PW6 Dr Aaron Ang and PW7 Dr Lim, was that the accused was able to pass urine because all these doctors had given clear evidence that it could be ruled out that the accused could not pass urine because of his cervical injury. [^24] I therefore rejected the accused’s claim that because of his cervical injury or even his drug abuse, he was unable to pass urine when requested to do so by the 2 Police officers on 8 May 2017.

#### (v)   Self-reporting of his symptoms by the accused

49     In rounding up my evaluation of the medical evidence before the court, I should also for completeness make the following observation. Even after making allowance for the fact that the accused was not legally represented, it did not escape my attention that the accused was rather inconsistent when reporting his symptoms and medical condition to the various doctors of CGH.

50     I have earlier at paragraph \[ 24 \] dealt with the testimony of Dr Shi. On conducting her physical examination of the accused on 8 May 2017 and having asked the accused why he had passed urine in his jeans, the accused told Dr Shi that he was “_not sure why he wet himself \[today\], denies urge incontinence, initially saying no sensation of urine, then changed to say feel urine inside need to strengthen to \[pass urine\], saying don’t know why water just come out.”_ Dr Shi had recorded this piece of self-reporting by the accused in the A&E Discharge Summary (Exhibit P6). Continuing her testimony, Dr Shi had further explained that when she heard this, it was not very clear what the accused was trying to say because the information given to her was different – the accused had first said he could not feel urine and then he later changed his position and said he could feel urine in his bladder. Dr Shi then tried to clarify with the accused whether he could feel urine in his bladder. The accused did not give a clear response.[^25] I find that this inconsistency in the accused’s self-reporting was not a one-off lapse or even taking a benign view, that he was possibly disoriented or under stress after his arrest on 7 May 2017. I note further that the accused continued with this pattern of inconsistency even several months later when he went for his follow-up visits with the Urology Department of CGH. For example, on 18 July 2017, 17 October 2017 and 9 January 2018, the accused had reported to Dr Luo and Dr Daanesh that he had incomplete emptying of his bladder and needed to strain to empty his bladder. What is significant however is that the objective result of the uroflowmetry test done on 17 October 2017 and again on 9 January 2018 showed that the accused had managed to empty his bladder completely (_0 ml of post-void residual urine in his bladder_).[^26]

51     In my judgment, such inconsistencies in his account of his ailments to different doctors and on different occasions, all cast significant doubt over the accuracy of his _self-reported symptoms._ I am therefore of the view and agree with the Prosecution that this court should be slow to place any reliance on the accused’s self-reported symptoms on 8 May 2017. I have therefore given more weight to the objective and verifiable medical evidence as indicated in the results of the uroflowmetry tests and ultrasound scans, urine tests and physical examination of the accused tendered before the court.

#### (vi)   Accused’s claim that the statement was inaccurately recorded

52     Moving away from the evaluation of the medical evidence tendered in court as discussed above, I deal with the final allegation of the accused as indicated at Point \[ 17 \] of his written closing submissions.

#### (vii)   Point 17

53     It had come out during the accused’s cross-examination of PW2 SGT Dominic that he was alleging that paragraphs 5 – 8 of his s 22 CPC statement were inaccurate. The specific allegation of the accused was that SGT Dominic did a copy and paste of these specific portions of the accused’s statement from his computer.[^27] I note that this is a bare assertion of the accused and without any supporting evidence proffered.

54     In any case, to deal with this allegation of the accused I noted that when confronted with these assertions of the accused, SGT Dominic was emphatic and had maintained that the information contained in these paragraphs actually had come from the accused himself. [^28] He also confirmed his earlier position during EIC that he did not record anything that the accused did not say or leave out anything that the accused had said.[^29] SGT Dominic also reiterated that the statement was read back to the accused in its entirety, paragraph by paragraph. The accused was also given a chance to read it himself. He further emphasized that at that time, the accused did not raise any objections. I note that this factual position was not just obvious from SGT Dominic’s oral evidence.[^30] Significantly, this is also self-evident on the face of the Statement itself where the accused had signed against the last paragraph stating that all eight paragraphs of the statement were read back to him in English. The accused had even signed on each page after the paragraphs were read back to him.

55     It is necessary here to make a further observation. I have examined carefully the contents of the Statement. Even a perfunctory examination will immediately throw up the realization that the substance of the information contained in paragraphs 5 – 8 of the s 22 CPC Statement had personal details that could only have come from the accused himself. It is therefore inconceivable that SGT Dominic could have had creatively manufactured those paragraphs. It is only necessary to just scrutinize a few paragraphs to come to the easy conclusion that the accused’s allegation was baseless. As an illustration, there were details on the accused’s consumption patterns, namely, “two to three times a month”, how he would “finish up the whole straw as he will get a stronger high” and “each straw of ‘Panas’ will usually last \[him\] for four to give puffs”. Noticeably, there were also significant details like how much he paid and also who he paid for the drugs, namely, “SGD $40” and “Irwan” who was the accused’s “friend” and “colleague from work”. Further, there were even details like “Irwan” noticed that \[he\] had a supervision reporting card and asked if \[he\] wanted to buy some ‘Panas’ from him and \[he\] agreed”. The specificity and personal nature of these details was immediately apparent. In my view, in the absence of a clearly expressed motive on the part of SGT Dominic, it would be quite incredulous to suggest that SGT Dominic could have come up with such specific and precise facts. I therefore rejected the accused’s allegation. Accordingly, I also gave due weight to the accused’s s.22 Statement.

#### Prosecution invites court to draw adverse inference for accused electing to remain silent

56     The Prosecution had also invited the court to draw an adverse inference against the accused for his election to remain silent when he was called upon by the court to enter his defence to the charge against him.

57     In this regard, s. 291 (3) (a) of the CPC states that –

(i)    after being called by the court to give evidence or after he or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will give evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed; or

(ii)  having been sworn or affirmed, without good cause refuses to answer any question

the court, in deciding whether the accused is guilty of the offence, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper.

\[Emphasis added\]

58     The Court of Appeal in _Took Leng How v Public Prosecutor_ (_“Took Leng How”)_ at paragraphs \[42\] – \[43\] clarified the scope of “such inferences” referred to the previous formulation of s 291(3) (a), namely s 196 (2) of the CPC. The Court of Appeal also referred in this regard to the well-known case of _Haw Tua Tau v PP_ \[1981 – 1982\] SLR(R) 133 where the Court of Appeal had stated at \[42\] that “_what inferences are proper to be drawn from an accused’s refusal to give evidence depend on the circumstances of a particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary common sense_” and the strongest inference being one of guilt itself. This pronouncement also affirmed the decision in _Chai Chien Wei Kelvin v Public Prosecutor_ [^31] at \[82\]:

_On the other hand_, _if aspects of the evidence taken alone or in combination with other facts clearly call for an explanation_ _which the accused ought to be in a position to give, if an explanation exists, then a failure to give any explanation may_ _as a matter of common sense allow the drawing of an inference that there is no explanation and that the accused is guilty._

59     Using the above statements as a guide, and noting also that the medical evidence in this case provided by a total of 7 doctors and several medical reports, this was a case that “_clearly called”_ for an explanation from the accused. It was one thing for the accused to claim that he had a urine disorder on 8 May 2017. At the same time, the evidence clearly revealed that he had passed urine on his own on 2 occasions that very same day. Further, the accused had also been examined and certified by both the A&E doctors and also specialist urology doctors to be able to pass urine on that day. As such and even putting aside the accused’s s 22 long statement which contained incriminating matters pertaining to his drug consumption just before his arrest, the medical evidence alone warranted an explanation from the accused. None was forthcoming for reasons known only to the accused. In the absence of any explanation or reasons being given by oral evidence, there was nothing really to assist the accused apart from his bare assertions and tangential allegations made during his cross-examination of some of the prosecution witnesses. I find therefore that this was clearly a case of “ _Where evidence which has been given calls for an explanation which the accused alone can give_, **_then silence on his part may lead to the inference that none is available and that the evidence is probably true_****”** – paragraph \[43\] of _Took Leng How_. In the absence of any such explanation from the accused, I am of the view that the irresistible inference from the medical evidence is that the accused was entirely able to pass urine on his own on 8 May 2017 and he had deliberately chosen not to provide a urine sample to the police officers when requested to do so without reasonable excuse.

#### Adverse inference for not raising defence in cautioned statement

60     The Prosecution had also submitted that an adverse inference should also be drawn against the accused under s 261(1) of the CPC for not stating his defence in his cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC in respect of the charge against him. I note that the accused did not mention his defence of having a urine disorder in his cautioned statement. Further, the evidence before the court showed clearly that after the accused was administered the warning, he was also expressly told of the consequences of only raising a defence later at trial. However, the accused in response told PW14 IO Zulyadi who had recorded the s 23 CPC statement that “_I have nothing to say_”. I noted further that IO Zulyadi had told the accused that if there is anything he wanted to say, he could write it for him or that he can also write it himself. However, the accused maintained that he had nothing to say.[^32] A further opportunity to state his defence was given to the accused when his statement was read back to him. Again, the accused declined to do so and he did not make any amendments and signed on the statement.[^33]

61     In view of the above, I draw the proper inference that the accused’s alleged urine disorder was a no more than a ready-made and convenient afterthought.

## Conclusion

#### Accused found guilty and convicted

62     The accused essentially had no credible defence to the charge of failure to provide a urine specimen. The medical evidence against him was overwhelming. I also noted that the accused ran a curious defence and he seemed to be “_going this way and that way._” This was a 6-day trial with 15 Prosecution witnesses being called to give evidence, many of whom were medical doctors closely involved with the accused’s case. Yet the accused did not even cross-examine some of these doctors. The court on several occasions even had to remind the accused that it was in his interests to cross-examine the doctors on the medical evidence presented by these doctors in their oral testimony.

63     The accused’s s. 22 CPC Long Statement was positive. Despite the evidence against him, he elected to remain silent when called upon to enter his defence. This was not entirely surprising. As indicated above I had drawn the appropriate inferences against him for his election to remain silent when called upon to enter his defence. I had also drawn an adverse inference against the accused for not stating his claimed urine disorder defence in his s. 23 CPC cautioned statement.

64     In view of the above evidence, I find that the accused did not have any urine disorder that affected his ability to pass urine between 5.00AM and 11.00AM when he was asked to provide a urine specimen by SGT Fazli and W/SSGT Wee. I also find that he was able to pass urine later in the day on 2 occasions on 8 May 2017. Further, I also find that the accused was able also to pass urine on his own on his subsequent visits to the Urology Department of CGH on 18 July 2017, 17 October 2017 and 9 January 2018.

65     In my judgment, I am of the view that the accused did not have any reasonable excuse for not providing his urine specimen when required to do so by the police officers on 8 May 2017.

66     Accordingly, I find the accused guilty of the proceeded charge of failing to provide a urine specimen. The accused is found guilty and convicted on this Charge.

## Accused pleads guilty to 2 more proceeded Charges

67     After the accused had been found guilty and convicted on the single proceeded Charge, he elected to plead guilty to the following 2 Charges –

**_DAC-915536-2017_**

_You are charged that you, on 8 May 2017 at about 12.45 am, at Block 803 Chai Chee Road, Void Deck, in Singapore, did have in possession utensils intended for the consumption of a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, one burnt aluminium foil and one rolled up paper, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 9 and punishable under Section 33(1) of the said Act._

**_DAC-918795-2017_**

_You are charged that you, on the 24th day of April 2017 (Monday), in Singapore, being a person subjected to a Supervision Order for a period of 24 months with effect from 13th June 2015, issued under Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3, 1999 Rev Ed), did fail to present yourself for urine test to the Duty Officer at Bedok Police Divisional HQ as required under the said Order and you have thereby committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the aforesaid Regulations and punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the aforesaid Regulations._

## Statement of Facts

68     The statement of facts for the for these 2 proceeded charges stated as follows –

_“Statement of Facts_

PP v MOHAMAD ESKAH BIN ABDUL MALEK

STATEMENT OF FACTS

1.    The accused is Mohamad Eskah Bin Abdul Malek, male, 44 years old, Singaporean, bearing NRIC No.: XXX (date of birth: 15 December 1974)

FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 2nd CHARGE (DAC-915536-2017) –POSSESSION OF DRUG UTENSILS

2.    On 8 May 2017, at about 12.45am, at the void deck of block 803, Chai Chee Road, Singapore, the accused was stopped by police officers from the Singapore Police Force. The police officers asked for his particulars and he provided a NRIC number which did not belong to him. Upon further questioning, the police officers saw that the accused had a stack of medical certificates, and found an NRIC number “XXX” on the medical certificates, and noticed that the NRIC number of the medical certificates did not tally with the NRIC number the accused provided. As such, a screening was done on the NRIC number “XXX” and it was found that the person bearing the said NRIC number was wanted via Police Gazette for failing to report for urine test. The accused then admitted that the said NRIC number was his NRIC number. He was then arrested for failing to report for urine test and for being suspected of having consumed a specified drug. The following was also seized from him:-

(a)    one burnt aluminium foil; and

(b)    one rolled up paper.

3.    The accused was then brought to Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations. The accused admitted that the abovementioned items belonged to him and were in his possession for the purpose of drug consumption, in particular, heroin.

4.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s 9 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3rd CHARGE (DAC-918795-2017) - FAILING TO REPORT FOR URINE TEST

5.    The accused was placed under compulsory supervision with effect from 13 June 2015 for a period 24 months by virtue of Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“**MDR**”).

6.    Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(f) of the MDR, the accused was required to present himself to the Duty Officer at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, on every Monday, Friday of each month, from 9.30 am to 10.00 pm, commencing on 15 June 2015 for urine tests during the period of supervision, that is from 13 June 2015 to 12 June 2017, except Public Holidays. However, the accused failed to report for urine test on 1 occasion. On **24 April 2017 (Monday)**, the accused failed to present himself for urine test at Bedok Divisional Headquarters without any valid reasons.

7.    The accused has thereby committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) and punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the MDR.

_JANE LIM_

_DEPUTY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR_

_SINGAPORE_

_27 May 2019”_

69     The accused admitted to the above statement of facts without qualification.

## Antecedents

70     The accused had drug antecedents. On the 2nd of March 1999, the accused was convicted of 3 counts of failure to report for urine test for which he was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment each and a total of 6 months’ imprisonment term. Subsequently, on the 12th of July 2011, the accused was convicted of 1 count of consuming a specified drug to which he was punished under Section 33A (1) of the LT1 regime and he was sentenced to 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane. In addition, on the 28th of May 1994, the accused was admitted into DRC for 1 count of consumption of a controlled drug for a total of 12 months. And on the 12th of January 1996, the accused was admitted into DRC for the consumption of a controlled drug for a total of 18 months. The accused also had other remaining antecedents that were not drug related.

## Submissions by Prosecution on sentence

71     The Prosecution had submitted for a global sentence of 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment. For the failure to provide a urine specimen, the Prosecution asked for an uplift of 6 months from the _mandatory minimum s_entence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. For the failure to report for urine test charge, a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was sought. The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment for the possession of drug utensils charge.

## Mitigation

72     In mitigation, the accused asked for leniency and the lightest sentence.

## Sentencing considerations

73     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence. I had noted the accused’s drug antecedents and also that he was to be punished as if he had been convicted of a LT-2 drug charge with the punishment prescribed as mandatory minimum imprisonment of not less than 7 years and not more than 13 years and not less than 6 strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane. The accused had also claimed trial to the proceeded charge and was therefore not entitled to the usual sentencing discount for accused who had shown remorse by pleading guilty to the charge.

#### Sentence

74     In view of the above considerations, I sentenced the accused as follows –

DAC-915535-2017    7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes

DAC-915536-2017    4 months’ imprisonment

DAC-918795-2017    6 months’ imprisonment

75     I ordered the imprisonment terms for DAC-915535-2017 and DAC-915536-2017 to run consecutively. The accused was therefore sentenced to a total of 7 years and 10 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. He is appealing against his conviction on the s. 31 (2) MDA charge.

76     The accused is presently serving sentence.
