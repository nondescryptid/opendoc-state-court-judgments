### District Judge Seah Chi-Ling:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused, a 21-year-old male Singaporean (the “**Accused**”), pleaded guilty to one charge of operating a small unmanned aircraft outdoors in a manner likely to endanger the safety of persons and property in contravention of Paragraph 72E(1)(b) of the Air Navigation Order, Cap 6 OR 2 (1990 Rev Ed) (“**ANO**”) (the “**2**nd**Charge**” or the “**Proceeded Charge**”). The Accused further consented to one charge of operating a small unmanned aircraft outdoors for a recreation purpose without a valid Class 2 activity permit in contravention of Paragraph 72F(2) of the ANO (the “**1**st**Charge**” or the “**TIC Charge**”) being taken into consideration (“**TIC**”) for the purpose of sentencing.

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) without qualification, and was convicted accordingly. The Proceeded Charge is a fine only offence, punishable with a fine of up to $20,000 for a first time offender pursuant to Paragraph 72E(1)(b) of the ANO read with Paragraph 80(5) of the ANO.

3       As the Accused was 19 years old at the time of the commission of the offences in February 2018, Defence Counsel submitted that a Probation Suitability Report (“**PSR**”) should be called[^1]. When dealing with the sentencing of a youthful offender, the court would generally call for a probation suitability report before imposing the sentence, and would not embark on an assessment of the offender’s suitability for probation without the benefit of such a report: see _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> at \[20\] (“_Karthik_”); _Wong Shan Shan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 49</span> at \[19\] and \[21\]. I thus called for a PSR. Probation was recommended. However, after hearing the parties’ arguments on sentence, I declined to make a probation order and sentenced the Accused to a fine of $5,000 (in default 20 days’ imprisonment) instead. The Accused is dissatisfied with his sentence and has filed the present appeal against his sentence.

## THE CHARGES

4       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge (the “**Proceeded Charge**”):

> 2nd Charge

> You \[--\] are charged that you, on 8 February 2018, sometime in the late afternoon, at the open field next to Sengkang LRT station, Singapore, did operate a small unmanned aircraft outdoors, _to wit_, a DJI Mavic Pro with total mass of 0.743kg, in close proximity to the train tracks of Sengkang LRT station and overflying pedestrian walkways in the vicinity of Sengkang LRT station, in a manner likely to endanger the safety of persons and property, and you have thereby contravened Paragraph 72E(1)(b) and punishable under Paragraph 80(5) of the Air Navigation Order, Cap 6 OR 2 (1990 Rev Ed).

5       The Accused consented to the following charge being TIC for the purpose of sentencing:

> 1st Charge

> You \[--\] are charged that you, on 8 February 2018, sometime in the late afternoon, at the open field next to Sengkang LRT station, Singapore which is in an area within 5 kilometers of two aerodromes, namely Seletar Airport and Paya Lebar Air Base, did operate a small unmanned aircraft, _to wit_, a DJI Mavic Pro with total mass of 0.743kg, outdoors for a recreation purpose without a valid Class 2 activity permit for flying the unmanned aircraft type corresponding to the said small unmanned aircraft, and you have thereby contravened Paragraph 72F(2) and punishable under Paragraph 80(5) of the Air Navigation Order, Cap 6 OR 2 (1990 Rev Ed).

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

6       The material portions of the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) relating to the Proceeded Charge which the Accused admitted to without any qualification are as follows:

> _STATEMENT OF FACTS_

> _1_.     _The accused is Homen Wong (“Homen”), a 21-year old male Singapore citizen (D.O.B. 18 August 1998). ….. At the material time, the accused was a full-time National Serviceman._

> _2_.     _On 8 February 2018, sometime in the late afternoon, Homen flew a DJI Mavic Pro unmanned aircraft (the “drone”) for about 40 minutes at an open field next to Sengkang LRT station. The drone weighed 0.743kg._

> _3_.     _Homen had operated the drone without requiring a Class 2 activity permit from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). If he had applied for such an activity permit, CAAS would have required Homen to operate his drone in compliance with safe operating conditions, which include:_

>> _a_.     _ensuring the drone is not flown for longer than 85% of the maximum battery endurance;_

>> _b_.     _ensuring the drone does not overfly all persons, public roads, vehicles, and structures that are not involved in the drone’s activity;_

>> _c_.     _ensuring that the drone does not interfere with public transport or emergency service providers, or distract or endanger members of the public; and_

>> _d_.     _obtaining clearance from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (“RSAF”) prior to operating the drone, in order to ensure that the drone’s flights do not interfere with RSAF operations._

> _5_.     _During the 40-minute flight, Homen flew his drone at a maximum height of 50 metres. He also flew it over pedestrian walkways with moderate human traffic. Furthermore, Homen flew his drone close to and over the train tracks of Sengkang LRT station (less than 10m away), in order to take aerial videos and photographs of LRT trains entering and leaving the station. When his drone was above the train tracks, it became low on battery power; Homen had not ensured its battery power was sufficient for the flight. As a result, Homen lost control of the drone and it landed autonomously on the train tracks of Sengkang LRT station, where it was eventually struck by an LRT train._

> _6_.     _Later that evening on 8 February 2018, Homen approached the station staff of Sengkang LRT station for help to retrieve his drone. Station staff eventually helped retrieve the damaged drone on 15 February 2018 and returned it to Homen. There was neither actual damage to any LRT train nor disruption to train services._

> _7_.     _Homen subsequently posted a video of the above incident on Youtube, entitled “DJI Mavic Pro survived a train crash”. Following the circulation of the video on the internet, SBS Transit Pte Ltd made a report to the CAAS regarding this incident on 9 April 2018._

> _8_.     _By virtue of the foregoing, Homen has committed the offence of operating an unmanned aircraft outdoors in Singapore, in a manner likely to endanger the safety of persons and property, which is an offence under Paragraph 72E(1)(b) of the ANO, which offence is punishable under paragraph 80(5) of the ANO._

## ANTECEDENTS

7       The Accused is untraced.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE

8       As noted above, the Proceeded Charge under Paragraph 72E(1)(b) of the ANO is a fine only offence, attracting a maximum fine of up to $20,000 for a first-time offender. The Prosecution sought a fine of not less than $5,000. The Prosecution submitted that general deterrence is the key sentencing consideration as the present charge is one that affects public safety. The manner in which the Accused flew the drone posed significant harm to persons and property. It was fortunate that no harm was caused[^2].

9       The Prosecution opposed the probation order sought by the Defence. The Prosecution did not dispute that considerations of rehabilitation featured here as the Accused was 19 years old at the time of the offence. The retrospective rationale underlying the primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offenders would apply to reduce the Accused’s culpability in light of his relatively young age and immaturity at the time of the offence. However, Prosecution submitted that there was significant difficulty in applying the prospective rationale to the Accused and the offence in question. The Prosecution noted that the offences here are strict liability offences concerning issues of social concern (including public safety), which are “not criminal in any real sense, but are acts which in the public interest are prohibited under a penalty”[^3]. The commission of the offences was not due to a want in the character of the accused requiring correction, nor was his offending conduct of a nature reflective of a defect in reasoning or attitude in need of curing. Viewed in this light, Prosecution submitted that there is little that the prospective rationale can hope to achieve[^4]. On balance, general deterrence should take primacy in the sentencing equation, and accordingly, the accused should be sentenced to a fine instead of probation.

## MITIGATION PLEA AND SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE BY DEFENCE

10     The Defence relied on _Karthik_ and urged the court to place the Accused on probation instead. Counsel highlighted that the Accused was only 19 years old at the time of the offence and 21½ years old at the time of sentencing. The presumptive primacy sentencing consideration should therefore be one of rehabilitation. Counsel highlighted, in addition, the following factors:

> (a)     The Accused was untraced;

> (b)     The Accused is already a settled-down individual, having married his wife in March 2019. He is contemplating further studies, and in the meantime, is keeping himself gainfully employed as a part-time Grab and Food Panda deliveryman. As such, he is not a person with no purpose or direction in life;

> (c)     No property damage or personal injury was caused in the present case;

> (d)     The Accused had been cooperative in the investigations, and further demonstrated remorse by pleading guilty early[^5]; and

> (e)     The PSR also found the Accused suitable for, and recommended for him to be placed on, probation.

## SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS

11     The law takes a presumptive view that when sentencing youthful offenders, the primary sentencing consideration is one of rehabilitation. This is justified based on the retrospective rationale and the prospective rationale which underlie the presumptive primacy of rehabilitation in relation to youthful offences. The threshold age in determining the applicability of the said rationales is generally set at 21 years of age: see _Karthik_ at \[20\], and \[43\] – \[45\].

12     In the present case, the accused was 19 years old at the time of the offence, and was just over 21 years old (i.e. 21½ years old) at the time of sentencing. This was incidentally the factual matrix encountered in _Karthik’s_ case. In a case such as the present, the retrospective rationale would continue to apply given the Accused’s age at the time of the offence. In contrast, the prospective rationale would _not_ apply to the offender as strongly as the threshold age has been crossed at the time of sentencing. That does not however mean that accused would not, without more, be treated as a youthful offender such that rehabilitation as the presumptive dominant sentencing consideration would cease to apply. Whether the accused should be treated as a youthful offender in such a scenario will depend on all the facts of the case. Some of the factors the court would consider in making this assessment are: (a) the offender’s actual age at each of the two material points in time; (b) the length of delay between the two points in time; and (c) available evidence of the trajectory of the offender’s rehabilitative progress in the intervening period: see _Karthik_ at \[58\].

13     On the facts of the present case, there was a time lag of some 1½ years from the time the offence was committed to the date the accused was charged in court, as a result of which he had crossed the threshold age at the time of sentence. Counsel submitted that if the accused been charged sooner after the commission of the offence, he would have been below 21 years of age _both_ at the time of offence and at the time of sentence. In that eventuality, both the retrospective and prospective rationales would have applied to him.

14     Having regard to the fairly lengthy time lag between the date of the offence and the date the accused was charged in court (for which the accused was in no way responsible for), and the fact that the accused was only slightly above the threshold age at the date of sentence, I am of the view that the accused should be treated as a youthful offender for present purposes. Indeed, the Prosecution does not contend otherwise. The presumptive presumption that rehabilitation is the primary sentencing consideration for youthful offenders would therefore apply to the Accused.

#### Sentencing principles in relation to youthful offenders

15     It bears repeating that the proposition that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing consideration for youthful offenders is but a presumptive starting point. Even for youthful offenders, it is clear that the presumptive sentencing consideration can be displaced based on a consideration of the nature of the offence and the facts of each case. In _Karthik_, Sundaresh Menon CJ summed up the 2-stage approach for the sentencing of youthful offenders as follows:

> “64    The two-stage approach for sentencing youthful offenders is well established. In Boaz Koh (\[33\] supra), I set out this approach as follows (at \[28\], citing Al-Ansari (\[33\] supra) at \[77\]–\[78\]):

>> At the _first stage_ of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the _second stage_ of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.

> 65    At the first stage, the court is concerned with the threshold question of whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. _While rehabilitation is presumptively the dominant consideration when sentencing youthful offenders, its primacy may be diminished by the circumstances of the case or even eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution. This tends to be the position where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or (d) the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable do not exist_ (Boaz Koh at \[30\]). ……” _\[emphasis added\]_

16     It is clear that when applying the first stage of the _Karthik_ test, the focus of the inquiry is whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix. While rehabilitation is presumptively the primary sentencing consideration in relation to youthful offenders, its primacy may be diminished by the circumstances of the case or even eclipsed by considerations such as deterrence or retribution. Rehabilitation may consequently not be the primary sentencing consideration where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant; and/or (d) the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable do not exist.

17     As regards the last mentioned factor, when considering whether the conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing options viable exist, the court may in turn consider factors such as: (a) the nature of the rehabilitation best suited for the offender; (b) the availability of familial support for the offender’s rehabilitative efforts; and (c) any other special reasons or need for rehabilitation. (see _Karthik_ at \[65\]).

##### Stage 1 - Whether rehabilitation retains primacy in the sentencing matrix

#### Seriousness of the offence – impact on public safety and facilities

18     I agree with the Prosecution that the offence in the present case is serious and brings to the fore considerations of general deterrence. The offence committed by the Accused affected public safety. In _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_”), the High Court noted that there are certain types of offences where general deterrence assumes significance and relevance. These may relate to the type and/or circumstances of a particular offence, which necessitates that “an unequivocal signal be sent to offenders involved in such offences that they would be visited with severe punishment” (at \[23\]-\[24\]). Offences affecting public safety, public services, or public or widely used facilities were identified as one such category of offences (at \[24(d)\].

19     Here the drone flown by the accused was clearly not of amateur grade – it weighed 0.743kg, could reach a height of 50 metres and could fly for an extended period of time (no less than 40 minutes)[^6]. The Accused had further flown the drone over pedestrians at a significant height in the vicinity of the Sengkang LRT Station. Based on the Prosecution’s calculations, if the drone had fallen from a height of 50 metres, it would have hit the ground in 3.19 seconds at a velocity of 112.76km/h, with the potential to cause significant injuries to pedestrians[^7]. The Accused also flew the drone close to and over the train tracks of the Sengkang LRT station in order to take aerial videos and photographs of LRT trains entering and leaving the station. Based on the TIC Charge, the drone was further flown near Seletar Airport and Paya Lebar Air Base, posing risks to aircrafts flying into and from the two aerodromes. While no actual injury was caused, the potential risk of harm occasioned to pedestrians, public services (eg the LRT) and aircrafts near the two aerodromes were significant. General deterrence would necessarily feature strongly in the sentencing equation.

#### Seriousness of the offence – prevalence of the type of offence

20     In _Law Aik Meng_, the High Court further identified the prevalence of a type of offence as another factor that attracts considerations of general deterrence. Thus, “where there are grounds for judicial concern about the _prevalence_ of particular offences, the court will mete out a stiff sentence to show its disapproval and to deter like-minded offenders” (at \[25(a)\]).

21     In this connection, both Prosecution and Defence Counsel referred to a Straits Times article dated 19 June 2019 entitled “_Unauthorised drones around Changi Airport delay 37 flights, affect operations of one runway_” (the “**ST Article**”). The ST Article referred to how 37 flights were delayed at Changi Airport, and one of its runways affected for more than 10 hours, over the 18 to 19 June 2019 period because of unauthorised drones. The ST Article also carried a report of the disruptions at London’s Gatwick Airport in December 2018, where the operation of unauthorised drones affected 140,000 passengers and more than 1,000 flights. Also mentioned in the ST Article were Parliamentary debates in which it was alluded that there had been eight reports of unauthorised drones flying within 5 km of Changi Airport over a 3-year period. Quite clearly, there has been an increasing prevalence of disruptions to public services, in particular in the aviation industry, occasioned by the unauthorised operation of drones. In my opinion, a clear message must be sent to like-minded individuals, whether young or old, that the operation of unmanned aircrafts in a manner likely to endanger personal safety, property and aircrafts, and prejudice public services, will be dealt with severely under law. Again, the sentencing principle of general deterrence assumes prominence.

#### Whether conditions viable for rehabilitation exist

22     Under the _Karthik_ test, a further factor which the courts take cognisance of when determining whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix is to ask whether conditions which make rehabilitative sentencing option viable exist. Another formulation of this requirement is to ask “whether the individual offender’s _capacity for rehabilitation_ is demonstrably high so as to outweigh the concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation” (see _Karthik_ at \[66\]).

23     Traditionally, the factors relevant to the assessment of the rehabilitative capacity or potential of a young offender include the following: (a) the strength of familial support and the degree of supervision provided by the offender’s family for his rehabilitation; (b) the frequency and intensity of the offender’s wrongful activities; (c) the genuineness of remorse demonstrated by the offender; and (d) the presence of risk factors such as negative peers or bad habits: see _Leon Russell Francis v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 651</span> at \[15\], cited in _Karthik_ at \[66\] (the “**_Leon Russell Francis factors_**_”_).

24     In addition to these traditional guidelines, in assessing whether conditions viable for rehabilitation exist, it is, in my opinion, also necessary to bear in mind the primary aims and objectives of rehabilitation. In Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Edition, 2019), the learned author, quoting _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span>, stated the aim of the rehabilitative principle in the following terms:

> “The rehabilitative rationale for sentencing seeks to justify the compulsory rehabilitative measures as a medium _for achieving the prevention of crime_” \[_emphasis added_\]

25     In line with the aforementioned aim, the learned author goes on to submit that two conditions need to be present before rehabilitation is applicable (at \[06.152\]):

> “**Conditions needed for rehabilitation to be applicable.** The focus of the rehabilitation principle is the offender – specifically, to provide him with help and support to address the root cause of his crime. _For rehabilitation to be a relevant sentencing object, two conditions need to be present_:

>> (a)     _Offender is at risk of offending._ _The mere fact that an offender is of good character does not mean that rehabilitation is a relevant sentencing objective. Good character may in fact suggest that rehabilitation is not a relevant objective, especially when the offender is not at risk of reoffending._ An example of this is Kalaiarasi d/o Marimuthu Innasimuthu v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 774</span>. In that case the appellant was convicted under section 82(1)(a) Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) for failing to discharge her obligation to submit to the Official Assignee accounts of moneys and properties. … The High Court … made the following observations:

>>> 42    I did not consider that it was appropriate to make any community order under the CPC 2010. _It did not strike me that rehabilitation was a particularly strong consideration in the circumstances._ As mentioned above, the appellant was of demonstrably good character. The circumstances under which she committed the offences, _viz_, her belief that her estranged husband would file returns on her behalf, also suggested that _her offending conduct was more of an inadvertent oversight than of a deliberate infraction. For the same reason, I did not think that probation was either necessary or appropriate._ I also considered that a discharge was more appropriate to take into account the unjustifiable delay in prosecution.

>> (b)     _Offender is amenable to reform._ _If an offender is not amenable to reform, then, depending on the facts, other sentencing objectives (eg prevention) may take centre place_.” _\[emphasis added\]_

26     I respectfully agree with the learned author’s view. While the _Leon Russell Francis_ factors provide useful guidelines in assessing whether conditions viable for rehabilitation exist, an application of these factors cannot be separated from a consideration of whether rehabilitation is _even necessary in the first place_ having regard to the specific character, biological make-up, disposition and circumstances of the offender in question. Thus, where the offender’s risk of reoffending is very low, and the offender’s behaviour is not borne out by any defects in character, it is difficult to see why rehabilitation as a sentencing consideration should be given special emphasis in the first place.

27     Applying these principles to the facts of our case, the accused’s PSR noted a number of protective factors, such as strength of familial support, lack of antecedents, demonstration of remorse, and constructive engagement. In my opinion, the presence of these protective factors, in and of their themselves, would _not_ justify rehabilitation where there are no character flaws and/or pro-criminal mind-sets or attitudes to correct to begin with. Based on the PSR, there does not appear to be any significant defects in the values system or personality of the Accused. It is not disputed that the Accused had operated an unmanned aircraft illegally, without consciously thinking about the consequences of his action. This act in itself was, however, not borne out of any deep-seated defects in character, or pro criminal disposition of the Accused, which rehabilitative sentencing options typically seek to address. As a result of the current charges, the Accused should by now be familiar with the legal regulations governing the operation of unmanned aircrafts. Indeed, the Probation Officer, Mdm Zanab Mohd Shariff, when questioned on the stand by the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor as to the Accused’s prospects of reoffending, stated his risk of reoffending to be “very low”[^8]. So construed, Homen’s _rehabilitative capacity_ is, in my view, _extremely limited_ as there is nothing much to rehabilitate to begin with. It also stands to reason that placing the Accused on probation would not achieve the primary aim of the rehabilitative principle, which is to use “compulsory rehabilitative measures as a medium for achieving the _prevention of crime_” \[_emphasis added_\].

##### Stage 2 - The appropriate sentence that would best meet the sentencing considerations

28     Overall, applying the _Karthik_ test, I do not think rehabilitation assumes primacy in the sentencing matrix here; instead, general deterrence does. I agree with the Prosecution that the accused cannot be said to be of a character requiring correction, nor was his offending conduct of a nature reflective of a defect in reasoning or attitude in need of curing. When applied to the specific facts of the accused’s case, there is little that rehabilitation as a sentencing option can hope to achieve[^9]. On the other hand, the need for general deterrence is undiminished by the facts of this case. Indeed, it is accentuated due to the high visibility in the public eye of the risks associated with the unregulated use of drones, and the risks actually posed here. The accused had further posted a video of the incident on YouTube entitled “DJI Mavic Pro survived a train crash”[^10], which contained aerial footages and photographs taken by the drone, as well as a reference of how the drone landed on the LRT tracks and was eventually hit by a train. The video was likely to have been seen by a fair segment of the public. To sentence the accused to probation would be sending a wrong message to members of public who have seen the video or read about the incident, that such risky behaviour would be let off lightly under law.

29     For completeness, I will deal briefly with the cases cited by Defence Counsel involving offences committed by youthful offenders while using personal mobility devices (“**PMDs**”)[^11]. The cited PMD cases were variously brought under sections 336, 337 and 339 Penal Code. Counsel noted that the PMD cases, in which the young offenders were placed on probation, involved culpability of “relatively heavier severity than \[the Accused’s\] first-time ANO offending”[^12]. Citing “relative sentencing parity”[^13], Counsel submitted that the Accused should similarly be placed on probation. With respect, I do not see how the PMD cases assisted the Accused in the present case. Based on the discussions above, drone-related and PMD offences engaged different public interests and public policy considerations. The nature, extent and/or manner in which harm would manifest themselves in the two genre of offences are in many cases different. Further, as Defence Counsel himself analysed at paragraph \[15\] of the Mitigation Plea, whereas sections 336 to 338 Penal Code offences require proof of rashness or negligence on the part of the accused, this is not required in relation to the present ANO offences in question, which appear to be drafted as strict liability offences. Given the significant difference in the legislative backdrop against which PMD and drone related offences are sought to be criminalised, as well as the different public interest and policy considerations impacted, I am unable to accept Counsel’s argument that the PMD cases serve as useful guides when sentencing the Accused, or that any arguments of “relative sentencing parity” should be given much weight.

30     All things considered, I am of the view that general deterrence should take primacy in the present case. The imposition of a fine mandated by law will best address the sentencing consideration impacted.

## SENTENCE

31     The Prosecution proposed the following sentencing framework for offences under paragraph 72E(1)(b) of the ANO centred on the actual harm or potential harm posed to persons, aircraft or property[^14]:

32     Prosecution further submitted that the following non-exhaustive factors should be analysed when assessing of the extent of harm:

> (a)      _Actual harm_ to persons, aircraft or property.

> (b)      _Actual interference_ with the operations of persons, aircraft or property, consequential to the danger posed. These can include interference with aerodromes (airport closure, efforts exerted in detecting drones) and planes (evasive manoeuvres, flight diversions), as well as other activities (e.g. interference with rail operations).

> (c)     The _risk_ of harm or interference with persons, aircraft or property, as assessed according to:

>> (i)       The flight area – altitude (which determines the velocity at which the drone would reach the ground) and population/ traffic density of the flight area.

>> (ii)       The drone’s characteristics e.g. its weight, use of reflective material, number of rotor blades etc.

>> (iii)       The manner in which the drone was flown, such as the speed, duration of flight, whether it was flown beyond visual line of sight and whether safety measures were implemented

33     The framework as proposed by the Prosecution is intended to apply to first-time offenders who claim trial. It was suggested that the sentence should then be calibrated on account of the offender’s culpability, as well as adjusted for aggravating (eg TIC charges) and mitigating factors (eg a young offender, early plea of guilt, or restitution).

34     I am of the view that the proposed framework set out a principled basis for sentencing offences under Paragraph 72E(1)(b) of the ANO, and utilizes the full range of punishment mandated by Parliament for the offence in question. The only change I would make is to the starting point of the fine amount for Band 1. This should, in my opinion, be lowered to $3,000, as Band 1 could conceivably cover a very wide range of offending conduct, some of which may involve minimal risk of harm (eg flying of a low-grade drone at a low height, for a short duration, in an open space, with no human traffic). A lower starting point for a Band 1 sentence would more adequately cater for the wide spectrum of cases that could potentially fall under Band 1. The framework as amended (the “**Framework**”) would also be consistent with the two cases dealing with similar provisions in the ANO that are discussed below.

35     In the first case of _Public Prosecutor v Ed Chen Junyun_ \[SC-905727-2019, unreported\] (_Ed Chen)_, the offender, a 37-year old male, pleaded guilty to one charge under Paragraph 72F(2) r/w Paragraph 72D(c)(b) punishable under Paragraph 80(5) of the ANO. In _Ed Chen’s_ case, the accused was a first-time drone operator who had flown his amateur grade drone with a weight of about 357 g for about 5 to 6 minutes, up to a maximum height of 6 metres, and within 5 km of Paya Lebar Air Base. He did so for recreation purposes at an open grass field with no persons around save for himself, his friend, and his friend’s wife. The accused was convicted and sentenced to a $2,000 fine[^15].

36      _Ed Chen’s_ case would, in my view, fall under Band 1 of the proposed sentencing framework as no harm, actual or potential, was caused. Culpability in that case was low. The aircraft was an amateur grade drone, flown at a low height (6 metres), and for a fairly short period of time (5 to 6 minutes), and in an area with very limited human traffic. The harm, actual and potential, that could be caused to persons, flights and property in the vicinity was limited. Starting with a Band 1 starting sentencing position of $3,000, and after factoring the mitigating factors and a sentencing discount for the plea of guilt, the fine of $2,000 is entirely consistent with the Framework.

37     In the second case of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Jin Kang_ \[SC-908934-2019, unreported\], the accused, male, 21 years of age, was spotted flying a drone around the Singapore Flyer area. The area where the accused had been flying the drone had, at the material time, been declared a special event area under the Public Order Act, Cap 257A in conjunction with the National Day Parade 2019. There were many signboard in the vicinity stating that flying/possession of any unmanned aerial vehicles in the said area was not allowed. The accused flew the drone up to a distance of about 10.8 metres over a period of about 45 seconds in the said special event area. The drone had a weight of 905 grams, a width of 9.5 inches, a length of 12.7 inches and a height of 3.3 inches. The accused pleaded guilty to an offence punished under section 26(3) read with section 26(2A)(a) of the Public Order Act and was sentenced to a $2,500 fine.

38     While _Tan Jin Kang_ was not dealing with an offence under Paragraph 72E(1)(b) of the ANO, the offending act in that case involved the unauthorised operation of a drone, which is similar to the fact patterns in _Ed Chan’s_ and the present case. The offence under Section 26(2A)(a) of the Public Order Act similarly attracts a fine of up to $20,000, though an offender may in addition be sentenced to imprisonment of up to 12 months or to both.

39     Like _Ed Chen’s_ case, _Tan Jin Kang_ will similarly fall within Band 1 of the Framework, given that the level of actual or potential harm caused in that case was low, and not elevated beyond that required to make out the offence. The drone was flown for an extremely brief period of time at a relatively low height, thus minimising the extent of harm to persons and property that could be caused thereby. After factoring a discount for the early plea of guilt, the $2,500 fine imposed by the learned District Judge is again consistent with the Framework.

## The Appropriate Sentence

40     In the present case, I agree with the Prosecution that the Accused’s conduct fell within Band 2 of the Framework. The operation of the drone in the present case posed significantly more danger to the public and public facilities. First, the accused’s act of overflying the drone in the vicinity of Sengkang LRT station, an area with significant foot-traffic and at a height of 50 metres would have posed significant danger to pedestrians and commuters on the ground[^16]. As noted in paragraph \[19\] above, if the drone fell from a height of 50 metres in 3.19 seconds, it could potentially have hit pedestrians at a velocity of 112.76 km/h, which would have easily caused grievous hurt.

41     The Accused’s act of flying his drone near to and over LRT tracks was another serious aggravating factor, as it posed further risks to commuters at the station and, furthermore, risked interfering with the LRT operations. As it turned out, the drone did eventually run out of battery power and descended onto the train tracks. It was eventually hit by a train, posing a real risk of disruption to rail services. Viewed in its totality, the accused’s conduct presented a significantly elevated risk to persons and property[^17].

42     Given the elevated risk posed by the accused’s conduct to pedestrians and LRT operations, I agree with the Prosecution that a starting point of $10,000, being in the middle of the prescribed range of penalties, is appropriate. I thereafter made adjustments to the starting point with reference to the following factors. First, the accused faced a further TIC charge for flying his drone in the vicinity of Seletar Airport and Paya Lebar Air Base without a permit, thereby posing a risk to the operations of these two aerodromes. This would ordinarily point towards an upward adjustment of the fine amount. On the other hand, I agree with the Prosecution that the sentence should be suitably adjusted in view of the mitigating factors, namely the accused’s early plea of guilt, and the fact that the Accused is a young offender[^18].

43     All things considered, I agree that a significant downward revision to a fine of $5,000 as suggested by the Prosecution is appropriate. This fine amount is consistent with the fines meted out in _Ed Chen_ and _Tan Jing Kang’s_ case based on a holistic consideration of the different factual matrixes in the three cases. The sentence in the present case ought to be higher than that in _Ed Chan’s_ case (where a fine of $2,000 was imposed), as the drone in the latter case was for all intents and purposes an amateur grade drone. The drone in _Ed Chen’s_ case weighed less than half the weight of the drone here, was flown up to a height of 6 metres only, and was further flown for 5-6 minutes in an open space with very limited human traffic. The danger the drone could potentially cause in _Ed Chen’s_ case was considerably lower. Similarly, the fine here should also be higher than that in _Tan Jing Kang’s_ case. While the drone in _Tan Jing Kang’s_ case was of comparable weight (0.905 kg), it was flown only for a short distance of 10.8 metres, to a limited height of 4 to 5 metres, and for a very brief period of 45 seconds before it was stopped. The potential harm that could be caused in _Tan Jing Kang’s_ case was therefore also considerably lower. In both _Ed Chen_ and _Tan Jing Kang_, the accused persons further only faced a single charge of operating a drone, whereas the Accused in the present case faced a further TIC charge of operating the drone in the vicinity of two aerodromes. A fine of $5,000 in the present case is therefore in line with the fines meted out in the afore-cited cases as well, and I sentenced the Accused accordingly.

44     The Accused, being dissatisfied, has appealed against the sentence. He is presently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
