### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Part I   Charges, Sentence and Appeal

1       On 3 July 2019, Md Gias Uddin Sarker (“the Accused”) pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> DAC 928344/2018 (Charge ‘C1A’)

> You, Md Gias Uddin Sarker, male, 48 years old, … …, Bangladeshi, are charged that you, on the 14th of May 2018, at about 5.00 p.m. at Blk 4A Kim Keat Close, Singapore, did commit criminal intimidation by threatening one Biswas Md Rasel with death, _to wit_, by saying to him in Bangladesh, _“torey bainda marmu kintu… khankir put, orr life-ta shesh koira dimu… shuorer baccha, maira falamu torey… torey pitaiya pulisher kache dimu”_ in Bengali, which in English means “**I will tie and beat you up…Son of a prostitute, I will end your life… Son of a pig, I will kill you… After being beaten up, you will be handed over to the police**”, with intent to cause alarm to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 506 (2nd limb) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (Rev. Ed. 2008).

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (Exhibit P1) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

3       The Accused then admitted to committing another offence of Voluntarily Causing Hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code (_vide_ MAC 907932/2018). The victim for this offence is the same Biswas Md Rasel (see charge above). The Accused gave his consent for the said charge to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

4       After hearing arguments on the issue of sentence from the Prosecution and the Defence, I imposed a sentence of three months’ imprisonment.

5       The Accused was dissatisfied with the said sentence, and has filed an appeal against sentence. The Accused was released on bail pending appeal.

6       The Accused faced a third charge of Giving False Information, an offence under s 182 PC (_vide_ MAC 907933/2018). The Prosecution withdrew the said charge and the Accused was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal.

## Part II   Facts

7       The victim in this case is one Biswas Md Rasel (hereinafter referred to as either “Rasel” or “the Victim”), a male Bangladeshi, 32 years old. Other than the Accused and the Victim, the other material witnesses involved in this case are :

> (a)     Shahjalal, a male Bangladeshi, 38 years old;

> (b)     Hossain Muzzam, male Bangladeshi, 44 years old; and

> (c)     Aulad, a male Bangladeshi, 32 years old.

8       The portions of the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) which are pertinent to the commission of the offence by the Accused are reproduced below:

> 5.    At the material time, Rasel, Shahjalal, Aulad and Muzzam were all working in the Company under the Accused’s supervision. They did a variety of construction jobs.

> **First Information Report**

> 6.    On 14 May 2018 at around 6.11pm, the Accused called “999” stating “my worker stole my money from my office and run away already”. The incident location given was Apt Blk 4A Kim Keat Cl, Singapore 328916.

> **Facts relating to the 1st charge (DAC-928344-2018)**

> 7.    Rasel started working at the Company in January 2018.

> 8.    After working for some months, on 14 May 2018, Rasel spoke with the Accused over the phone, and told the Accused that he did not want to work in the job that he had been assigned, namely cable tunneling. The Accused asked Rasel to meet him at his office, located at 4A Kim Keat Close, Singapore (“the office”), to have a face-to-face discussion.

> 9.    At about 5 pm, Rasel and the Accused had a discussion in the office. At some point during the discussion, Rasel expressed his desire to return to Bangladesh and also asked for his outstanding salary for March and April 2018. The Accused asked Rasel to sign salary slips stating that his salaries for March and April 2018 had been paid to him. Rasel did this before receiving his salary, and he and the Accused agreed that Rasel would leave Singapore on 20 May 2018.

> 10.    However, the Accused later refused to pay Rasel and instead claimed that he would hand over Rasel’s salary, together with his passport, at the airport on 20 May 2018. The Accused asked for Rasel’s work permit. Rasel was not willing to accept this arrangement, and repeatedly asked the Accused for his salary, whilst refusing to hand over his work permit as he wanted to be paid first. The two stood firm on their respective positions. As the argument progressed with Rasel repeatedly refusing the Accused’s demands for his (Rasel’s) work permit, the Accused became increasingly agitated. The Accused then started to become verbally abusive – amongst other things, he scolded Bengali vulgarities at Rasel, and told Rasel that he may beat Rasel if Rasel made him angry.

> 11.    At one point, the Accused stood up from his table in anger, and slapped Rasel on the face once. He then threatened Rasel in Bengali with the words, _“torey bainda marmu kintu…khankir put, orr life-ta shesh koira dimu… shuorer baccha, maira falamu torey… torey pitaiya pulisher kache dimu”_, which in English means “**I will tie and beat you up… Son of a prostitute, I will end your life… Son of a pig, I will kill you… After being beaten up, you will be handed over to the police**”. The Accused said these words with the intent to cause alarm to Rasel. Rasel felt alarmed by the Accused’s words.

> 12.    By this time, Shahjalal and Muzzam had also entered the office. The Accused then told one of them to close the door, and this was done. The Accused and Rasel continued to argue about the permit, which Rasel still refused to hand over. Shahjalal and Muzzam also attempted to physically retrieve Rasel’s work permit, which was in Rasel’s wallet in his back pocket, but failed to do so, and also stopped Rasel from leaving the room with physical force. Later, Shahjalal and the Accused also physically assaulted Rasel.

> 13.    Eventually, some 22 minutes after the door was closed, Rasel managed to flee from the office by jumping from the balcony (located on the second storey) to the ground floor. After running for a while, Rasel asked a passer-by for directions to the nearest police station and filed a police report later that evening. The accused also filed a police report against Rasel after Rasel fled from his office.

> ….. …..

> **Audio recording**

> 15.    In the course of investigations, Rasel handed over to the police an audio recording which he had recorded, without the Accused’s knowledge, while in the office. Amongst other things, the audio recording captured the vulgarities and verbal threats which the Accused directed at Rasel, as well as hitting noises.

## Part III   Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

9       The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least three months’ imprisonment.

10     In its written address on sentence (Exhibit P4), the Prosecution referred the court to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Chen Weilong, Adrian_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 239</span> _(“Chen Weilong”)_. In _Chen Weilong_, the accused pleaded guilty to one count under s 323 PC and one count under s 506 PC. The facts revealed that the accused had a dispute with his girlfriend. He returned home and armed himself with a chopper with the intent of using it to frighten his girlfriend. The accused then went to the victim’s restaurant to look for his girlfriend. The accused and his girlfriend continued their quarrel outside the victim’s restaurant. The victim witnessed the argument and approached the accused’s girlfriend. At one stage, the victim raised her voice and told the accused off. Subsequently, the accused’s girlfriend left the place. The accused then went back to the restaurant to confront the victim. Inside the restaurant, the accused charged at the victim with the chopper in his right hand. He pushed the victim, causing the victim to fall to the ground. After the victim stood up, the Accused placed the chopper to the left side of the victim’s neck and verbally threatened her “I want to chop you”. The accused also punched the victim once on the right side of her face. The said physical assault was the subject matter of the s 323 PC charge. Customers at the restaurant stepped in to stop the accused and pushed him out of the restaurant.

11     After hearing the prosecution’s submission on sentence and the accused’s plea in mitigation, the District Judge in _Chen Weilong_ sentenced the accused to 18 months’ imprisonment for the s 506 PC charge and two weeks’ imprisonment for the s 323 PC charge. Both sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently. The accused filed an appeal against sentence. However, the appeal was discontinued after the District Judge has released his Grounds of Decision. In his Grounds of Decision, the District Judge provided three offence-specific factors to consider in sentencing and these are:

> (i)     Nature of the threat and the degree of alarm or compulsion it engenders in the victim. The culpability of the offender must be greater the more grievous the nature of hurt threatened, and the more real and imminent it is to the intended victim;

> (ii)     The level of premeditation on the part of the offender. There is a difference whether an offender approached the incident with intent and was armed with a weapon to carry out the threat, or whether it was an escalation out of impulse; and

> (iii)     The environment and surrounding context. The sense of alarm is magnified when the threat is made in public.

12     For the present case, the Prosecution’s submissions on the offence-specific factors, which were based on _Chen Weilong_, could be summarised as follows:

> (i)     The nature of the threat uttered by the Accused was a serious one, that is, a threat to cause death. The threat was uttered twice;

> (ii)     The threats were uttered during a dispute in which the Accused had given instructions for the door to the office to be closed. Within a confined area, the Victim was outnumbered three-to-one. The Accused slapped the Victim once before uttering the threats;

> (iii)     The Accused’s workers tried to retrieve the Victim’s work permit forcefully from his back pocket;

> (iv)     The Victim was stopped from leaving the office. He had to resort to jumping from the balcony to the ground floor in order to escape from an environment that was hostile to him;

> (v)     The Accused was agitated and was scolding vulgarities at the Victim. The Accused has used his other workers against the Victim. The Accused uttered the threats in this context. The Victim was alarmed and feared for his own personal safety; and

> (vi)     The Accused, being the employer, was in a position of authority and had abused his authority in dealing with the dispute with the Victim and making use of his workers to his advantage.

13     The Prosecution also referred the court to the case of _Woon Salvacion Dalayon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR 129</span> (_“Woon Salvacion”)._ The accused in _Woon Salvacion_ was an assistant manager of an employment agency which had recruited the four victims to work as domestic maid in Singapore. When the victims informed the accused that they no longer wished to work in Singapore, the accused told them that they would have to pay 70,000 pesos each to the agency, or she would hire someone to kill them in their home country. The victims were frightened from the threat and escaped from the agency that night, and made a police report. The accused claimed trial to the charges and was convicted after a trial. She was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. The accused appealed and her sentence was reduced to three months’ imprisonment.

14     The Prosecution submitted that the threat and the fear perceived by the Victim in the present case was greater than that in _Woon Salvacion._ This factor, together with an additional charge that was taken into consideration, should increase the indicative sentence. The Prosecution then factored in the plea of guilt and contended that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment, similar to _Woon Salvacion’s case_, should be imposed in the present case.

15     The last case referred to the court by the Prosecution was the case of _Public Prosecutor v Shaikh Salman Bin Anwar Baladaram_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 42</span> (_“Shaikh Salman”_). In _Shaikh Salman_, the accused was charged with two counts of criminal intimidation under s 506 PC (1st limb) although the threats uttered, namely, “_don’t make me mad. I will kill all 3 of you today_” and “_no one call the police or I will kill you all_”, were threats to cause death. The accused was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment and two months’ imprisonment for the respective threats uttered. The Prosecution argued that _Shaikh Salman_ should not be treated as a precedent justifying the imposition of a sentence lower than three months’ imprisonment. This is because had the charges in _Shaikh Salman_ been framed under s 506 PC (2nd limb), which carries a higher maximum punishment of 10 years’ imprisonment \[_cf_ maximum punishment of two years’ imprisonment for s 506 (1st limb)\], then calibration of the sentence upwards would be required, resulting in a higher sentence. The Prosecution submitted that a sentence of at least three months’ imprisonment would be an adequate punishment for the Accused.

16     In oral submissions, the Prosecution highlighted another aggravating factor, _i.e._ the Accused has committed the present offence whilst on bail for another pending criminal case. A check with the Court’s ICMS system showed the following summarised chronology of events:

17     The above table showed that the Prosecution has got its facts and submission correct.

## Part IV   Defence’s Address on Sentence

18     In the Defence’s written Plea-in-Mitigation (Exhibit D1), Counsel for the Accused argued for a sentence of not more than six weeks’ imprisonment.

19     Counsel’s plea-in-mitigation, made on the Accused’s behalf, could be summarised as follows:

> (i)     By pleading guilty, the Accused has saved considerable Court’s time and the Prosecution’s resources;

> (ii)     The plea of guilt is a clear expression of the Accused’s remorse;

> (iii)     Even a custodial term of six weeks would have a grave impact on the Accused’s business and family life; and

> (iv)     A custodial sentence of six weeks would be adequate deterrent on the Accused.

20     Counsel brought to my attention the case of _Tan Kay Beng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 10</span> (_“Tan Kay Beng”)_. In _Tan Kay Beng_, the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal intimidation under s 506 PC (2nd limb) and a charge of theft under s 379 PC. For the purpose of this grounds of decision, I shall only be discussing the criminal intimidation charge.

21     In _Tan Kay Beng_, the victim requested the appellant to supply 20 pieces of “Japan Velvet” silk screens at an agreed price of $880. The victim paid $80 as deposit. The appellant carried out the order. The order was purportedly made by the victim on behalf of OP KTV. OP KTV subsequently ceased business. The victim refused to honour the transaction, insisting that the appellant should claim from OP KTV. The appellant complained to John, a former customer, about the victim’s refusal to pay for the order of the silk screens. John offered to assist the appellant to collect the outstanding payment. A meeting with the victim was thus arranged. The meeting was held at a coffee shop. At the meeting, there was no resolution. In anger, the appellant banged the table. The victim picked up a beer mug and held it in a menacing posture. John immediately procured a bread knife from the coffee shop kitchen and pointed it at the victim’s neck. John demanded that the victim hand over his possessions to settle the debt to the appellant. The victim then placed his waist pouch on the table. The appellant took $166 and a handphone from the victim’s waist pouch.

22     In respect of the criminal intimidation charge, the District Judge sentenced the appellant to 21 months’ imprisonment. Upon the appellant’s appeal, the sentence was reduced to 3 months’ imprisonment.

23     Counsel drew my attention to \[45\] of the High Court’s judgment in _Tan Kay Beng_ and relied on the following passage:

> 45    ….. ….. I accept this conspectus as general encapsulation of current sentencing practices for this type of offence, with one qualification. While _prima facie_ it is correct to assert that aggravated criminal intimidation will attract higher punishment the sentence meted out must be tempered by both proportionality and just as crucially by the specific factual matrix. I stress in addition that these passages are to be viewed as no more than guidelines and should neither be religiously applied nor adhered to mechanically. In the final analysis it must be acknowledged that sentencing precedents function purely as an aid so that consistency in sentencing may be maintained. General consistency in sentencing while desirable is not an overriding sentencing consideration. The factual matrix always remains paramount.”

24     Basically, Counsel’s argument was that a sentence of not more than six weeks’ imprisonment fit the factual matrix of the present case, although the basis for this submission was not articulated, for instance, by distinguishing the sentencing precedents relied upon by the Prosecution. Counsel urged the court to ascribe mitigation value to the Accused’s plea of guilt.

## Part V   The Court’s Decision on Sentence

### No remorse

25     I found that the Accused’s election to plead guilty after hearing the audio recording was not an expression of remorse, but a practical realisation that the evidence against him was overwhelmingly in the Prosecution’s favour. It was my view that if the Accused had been candid in his instructions to his Counsel, then he would not have waited for the Prosecution to furnish the audio recording of the threats he had uttered. I was informed that the English transcript of the audio recording was furnished by the Prosecution in its Prosecution Supplementary Bundle. Yet, at that stage, the Accused has continued to elect to claim trial. I was thus unable to agree with Counsel that the Accused has shown genuine remorse.

26     Nevertheless, by pleading guilty, the Accused has indeed saved Court’s time and Prosecution’s resources. However, the weight to be attached is significantly reduced given the late stage in which the plea was entered.

27     Other than the Accused’s plea of guilt, there are no significant mitigating factors in the Accused’s favour.

### Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 2nd Edn, 2003)

28     The following commentary for a s 506 PC offence was made in the _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 2nd Edn, 2003)_ at page 217:

> A distinction is drawn between criminal intimidation _simpliciter_ and an aggravated form of criminal intimidation that attracts a higher punishment. For purpose of sentencing, the nature of the threat, the context in which it was uttered, and the effect on the victim are the most significant factors.

> ….. …..

> A threat to cause to cause death falls within the second limb. **_Where the threat to kill is without a weapon, the sentencing range for offenders with no prior record is between six and 12 months’ imprisonment_**. Where a weapon was used as part of the threat to cause death, a term of two years’ imprisonment was imposed by the High Court in two recent cases.

> (Emphasis mine)

29     The said commentary was cited with approval, albeit with one qualification, by the High Court in _Tan Kay Beng_ (see \[23\] above).

30     Following from \[28\] above, a custodial sentence is clearly warranted in the present case.

31     Where a victim was alarmed by the threat and feared for his/her safety, these are aggravating factors to be borne in mind. In the present case, the Victim was confined in the Accused’s office and was outnumbered by the Accused and the Victim’s co-workers. The threat was therefore perceived to be real and imminent such that the Victim has to resort to escaping from his ordeal by jumping from the balcony (on the second floor) to the first floor. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions at \[12\] and \[14\] above.

32     In my view, the main sentencing consideration would be specific deterrence.

33     In the final analysis, I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence that serves the need to protect the interests of the public; is consistent with sentencing precedents; and is sufficient to adequately punish and deter the Accused.
