Arbitration – Stay of court proceedings – Mandatory stay under International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) – Whether Defendant had taken step in proceedings – Whether dispute fell within scope of arbitration agreement

12 March 2021

### Deputy Registrar Jonathan Toh Jun Hian:

1       The Defendant applied by DC/SUM 4379/2020 (“SUM 4379”) for a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration on the basis that parties are bound by the arbitration agreement found at clause 23 of their agreement dated 24 January 2018 (the “Agreement” and the “Arbitration Clause” respectively).

2       The main issue in this application was whether the Defendant was precluded from obtaining a stay because it took a step in the proceedings by making an earlier application in DC/SUM 3510/2020 (“SUM 3510”) to set aside the Writ of Summons filed on 29 September 2020 (the “Writ”). I found that it did not and granted the order to stay these proceedings in favour of arbitration. The Plaintiff also raised a number of other issues which I did not find meritorious.

## The issues raised

3       The Plaintiff made the following arguments resisting the Defendant’s application:

> (a)     The Defendant was precluded from making this application as it took a step in the proceedings by applying for and proceeding with SUM 3510 to set aside the Writ of Summons filed on 29 September 2020 (the “Writ”).

> (b)     The Defendant did not raise a dispute to the Plaintiff’s claims which would trigger the operation of the Arbitration Clause.

> (c)     The Plaintiff’s pleaded claim in detinue for the Defendant’s alleged wrongful detention of a machine known as an “R&D Rapid Mixer Granulator Model-CRMG 13 Ltrs” (the “1st RMG”) fell outside the scope of the Arbitration Clause.

> (d)     The Arbitration Clause was unenforceable for being incomplete, ambiguous and/or uncertain.

4       I deal quickly with one preliminary point. Prayer 1 of SUM 4379 purported to rely on both the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”), s 6 and the Arbitration Act (Cap 10, 2002 Rev Ed), s 6 for the stay. Counsel for the Defendant, Mr Lin, acknowledged at the start of the hearing that IAA, s 6 was the applicable provision. Both parties proceeded with arguments solely on IAA, s 6. This was clearly correct. There was no dispute that the Plaintiff, one of the parties to the Agreement, is a foreign company registered in India with its place of business in India. The obligations under the Agreement related the sale, supply and delivery of various machinery or equipment by the Plaintiff to the Defendant in connection with a factory in Yangon, Myanmar. In the circumstances, the proposed arbitration was international as defined at IAA, s 5(2).

## Whether the Defendant had taken a step in the proceedings

### Procedural history

5       After the Defendant was served with the Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim both filed on 29 September 2020 (the “Writ” and “SOC” respectively), it applied in SUM 3510 to set aside the Writ. The following orders were prayed for:

> 1.    That the Writ of Summons filed herein on 29 September 2020 be set aside on the ground of irregularity pursuant to Order 12 Rule 7(1)(a) of the Rules of Court and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.

> 2.    That timelines for filing further pleadings in DC/DC 2314/2020 be held pending disposal of this application.

> …

6       The 1st Affidavit of Mr Khin Swe Oo filed on 21 October 2020 in support of SUM 3510 (“Mr Khin’s 1st Affidavit”) set out three grounds for the application:

> (a)     At the time the application was filed, the Plaintiff was not represented by solicitors.[^1] The individual who filed the writ, one Mr Amoghvarsha Shashidhar Koranmath, was not a solicitor. The Plaintiff, by a letter dated 22 September 2020, held Mr Koranmath out to be its employee based in Singapore.[^2] This was a breach of Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed), O 5 r 6(2) (“ROC”).

> (b)     The substance of the Plaintiff’s claims concerned a business-to-business claim, but it failed to comply with the State Courts’ pre-action protocol for business to business debt claims prior to commencing legal proceedings.[^3]

> (c)     The SOC did not conform to the usual form in that there were no paragraph numbers, and therefore it was “not feasible or practical for the Defendant \[to\] respond to such claim(s) or enter a Defence to the same.”[^4]

7       SUM 3510 was fixed to be heard on 23 November 2020. Before the hearing, Messrs Gomez & Vasu LLC filed a Notice of Appointment of Solicitor on 12 November 2020 giving notice to the Defendant that they had been appointed to act for the Plaintiff.

8       At the hearing of SUM 3510 on 23 November 2020, the Defendant maintained that it was proceeding with the application on all three grounds. According to the notes of evidence, the Plaintiff did not contest the application. However, the Court did not grant the relief sought and gave brief reasons.

> (a)     On the first ground, the court exercised its power under ROC, O 2 r 1(2) to cure the irregularity as it was more efficient to do so as compared to setting aside the writ and having the Plaintiff re-file fresh proceedings.

> (b)     On the second ground, the court noted that non-compliance with the pre-action protocol only had cost consequences but did not prevent the claim from being filed.

> (c)     On the third ground, the court simply noted that the Plaintiff had informed the court that it would be amending the SOC. I noted that as pleadings had not closed at this time, and the Plaintiff was entitled to do so without leave pursuant to ROC, O 20 r 3.

9       The court then gave case management directions for the Plaintiff to file and serve the amended SOC by 11 December 2020, and the Defendant to file and serve its Defence by 28 December 2020.

10     Before me, the Defendant maintained that at the hearing of SUM 3510, counsel for the Defendant had orally informed the court of the existence of the arbitration clause and that the Defendant intended to reserve its right to apply to stay the proceedings in favour of arbitration. Counsel for the Plaintiff took the opposite position and submitted that the alleged reservation was found neither in his own counsel’s notes nor the certified transcript of the notes of evidence of the hearing.

11     On this point, I was guided by _Kraze Entertainment (S) Pte Ltd v Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 39</span>. In that case, there was a dispute between the parties as to whether certain submissions were made to the court below in oral argument. The record of the notes of evidence did not contain such submissions. Counsel for the plaintiff wrote a letter to court purporting to set out the submissions they had made in oral argument. The court held (at \[2\]) that the record “stands as it stood” until the party applied to rectify the record or to record a further submission, and declined to take notice of the alleged submissions as set out in counsel’s letter.

12     In the circumstances, I did not proceed on the basis that the Defendant had reserved its right to apply to stay proceedings in favour of arbitration at the hearing of SUM 3510. No such reservation is found the application papers, the contemporaneous correspondence prior to or immediately after the hearing of SUM 3510, or the record of proceedings of the hearing. I also noted that the Defendant did not seek any case management directions for it to make such an application, but instead accepted, without more, the directions to file its Defence.

13     The Plaintiff served its Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) on 11 December 2020. Thereafter the Defendant informed the Plaintiff by letter dated 21 December 2020 that it intended to apply for a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration. The Plaintiff submitted that this was the first time a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration was raised.

14     The Defendant filed the present application in SUM 4379 on 28 December 2020, the date that it was to have filed its Defence.

### Legal principles governing what constitutes a “step”

15     IAA, s 6(1) states:

> **6.**—(1)    Notwithstanding Article 8 of the Model Law, where any party to an arbitration agreement to which this Act applies institutes any proceedings in any court against any other party to the agreement in respect of any matter which is the subject of the agreement, any party to the agreement may, at any time after appearance and _before delivering any pleading or taking any other step in the proceedings_, apply to that court to stay the proceedings so far as the proceedings relate to that matter. \[emphasis added\]

16     Both parties relied on two Court of Appeal cases for the applicable legal principles governing what constitutes a “step” under _IAA_, s 6(1).

17     The Court of Appeal in _L Capital Jones Ltd and another v Maniach Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 312</span> (“_Maniach (CA)_”) at \[77\] re-iterated the approach set out in _Carona Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Go Go Delicacy Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 460</span> (“_Carona_”) at \[55\]. If a defendant employed court procedures to challenge the merits of the claim, that would constitute a step. If the defendant’s act was purely procedural, then the question is whether it had proceeded

> from a procedural point of view, beyond a mere acknowledgment of service of process by evincing an unequivocal intention to participate in the court proceedings in preference to arbitration.

18     In _Carona_ at \[93\], the Court of Appeal undertook a comprehensive survey of the case law from other jurisdictions and derived four principles from those cases:

> First, where a party performs or carries out a significant act signifying that it is _submitting to the court’s jurisdiction_ rather than to arbitration to resolve the outstanding issues between the parties, that party will be deemed to have taken a step in the proceedings. Second, the act will be regarded as a step in proceedings if it is a step in furtherance of the action by _advancing the hearing of the matter in court_ in contrast to one that serves to smother the action and stop the proceedings dead in its tracks. Third, where a party does an act with the consent of the other party, this will not amount to taking a step in the proceedings. Finally, the courts usually take the position that parties should not blow hot and cold or equivocate. Instead, they should be decisive about whether they are insisting on arbitration in preference to litigation. Disingenuous reservations will be disregarded. Should a party wish to proceed to arbitration, that party must be ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration.

19      _Carona_ at \[94\] further exhorted a pragmatic approach when assessing the procedural act in question and emphasised that each case should be resolved based on principle rather than merely precedent.

### Application

20     It was common ground between the parties that SUM 3510 did not deal with the merits of the Plaintiff’s claim. As such, the nub of the question before me was whether, by proceeding with SUM 3510, the Defendant had proceeded “beyond a mere acknowledgment of service of process by evincing an unequivocal intention to participate in the court proceedings in preference to arbitration” (_Maniach (CA)_ at \[77\]).

21     The Defendant argued that it did not. It advanced the proposition that as long as a defendant had made the application to set aside or strike out proceedings based on procedural irregularity as opposed to challenging the merits of the claim, such an application would not constitute a step. It relied on the High Court’s decision in _Maniach Pte Ltd v L Capital Jones Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 801</span> (“_Maniach (HC)_”) and the English Court of Appeal’s decision in _Eagle Star Insurance Co Ltd v Yuval Insurance Co Ltd_ \[1978\] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 357 (“_Eagle Star_”).

22     In _Eagle Star_, the defendant took an application to strike out a “very defective” statement of claim which specified neither the contract sued upon, the nature of the breach, nor the way in which damages arose. The plaintiff took the position that the application constituted a step in the proceedings which precluded defendant’s later application to stay proceedings. _Eagle Star_ at 361 set out the principle that a “step” was one

> by which the defendant evinces an election to abide by the Court proceedings and waives his right to ask for an arbitration. Like any election, it must be an unequivocable act done with knowledge of the material circumstances.

And also one

> which impliedly affirms the correctness of the proceedings and the willingness of the defendant to go along with a determination by the Courts of law instead of arbitration.

23     Applying this, the English Court of Appeal held that the application to strike out the “very defective” writ was not an affirmation of the correctness of the proceedings, but a disaffirmation of them, and did not evince the election (_Eagle Star_ at 361).

24     The brief facts in _Maniach (HC)_ relevant to the present application are as follows. In a single summons, the 2nd defendant applied to strike out the action, and in the alternative, to stay the action in favour of arbitration. Two grounds were relied on for striking out: (i) that the plaintiff failed to obtain leave to commence proceedings against the 2nd defendant pursuant to Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), s 277C(_c_); and (ii) the claim, among other things, disclosed no reasonable cause of action.

25     The High Court held that the 2nd defendant’s prayer to strike out the proceedings on the first ground of a procedural defect, i.e. the plaintiff not having the requisite leave to commence proceedings, would not amount to a step in the proceedings. _Maniach (HC)_ at \[81\] stated that:

> the Company’s prayer to strike out these proceedings on grounds of a procedural defect cannot amount to a step in these proceedings. This aspect of the Company’s striking out application challenged Maniach’s proceedings _in limine_. Making that application did not put in play the merits of Maniach ’s claim. It did quite the opposite: by applying to strike out on that ground, the Company took the position that these proceedings should come to an immediate end, irrespective of the merits, because they suffer from a procedural defect which could not be cured retrospectively. In other words, the Company did not seek to advance the hearing of this action in court but sought instead… to smother it and stop it dead in its tracks.

26     The High Court concluded at _Maniach (HC)_, \[84\] that:

> A defendant who applies to strike out proceedings, as in _Eagle Star_ and in the case before me, on grounds of a fundamental procedural defect unrelated to the merits does not submit to the jurisdiction of the court. Instead, the defendant quite clearly rejects that jurisdiction.

27     This finding was not dealt with on appeal, which overturned _Maniach (HC)_ on the separate finding that by taking out an application to strike out the suit on its merits (even though it was not proceeded with at the oral hearing), the 2nd defendant had taken a step in the proceedings (_Maniach (CA)_ at \[83\]).

28     I did not think that either of the cases stood for the broad proposition advanced by the Defendant (above, at \[21\]). The principal difficulty I had was that two out of the three complaints detailed at \[6(b)\] and \[6(c)\] above (relating to the failure to comply with the State Court’s pre-action protocol and the lack of numbering in the SOC) were relatively minor. The Defendant’s proposed approach left the door open to a defendant taking applications objecting to all manner of procedural irregularities (however minor) without committing to a position of whether it prefers arbitration to litigation. That would contravene the principle that “parties should not blow hot and cold or equivocate” but rather “be decisive about whether they are insisting on arbitration in preference to litigation” (_Carona_ at \[93\]).

29     The mere fact that the challenge was procedural and not on the merits therefore did not conclude the inquiry. Such an approach also militated against the exhortation to “focus on substance rather than procedure and on principle rather than precedent” (_Maniach (HC)_ at \[101\]).

30     In this context, I note that the High Court in _Maniach (HC)_ mentioned that the application to strike out was made on the ground of a “fundamental” procedural defect (_Maniach (HC)_ at \[84\]). The English Court of Appeal in _Eagle Star_ also emphasised that the statement of claim there was “very defective” (at 361). The subtext of such emphasis appears to be that the defendants’ applications in those cases did not evince an intention to prefer court proceedings to arbitration because the defendants were not yet put to election. The court proceedings were fundamentally defective. On the other hand, a defendant who takes multiple procedural challenges to minor defects may well be found to have elected to participate in court proceedings.

31     The central question is therefore that of election: whether the Defendant had, by taking out and arguing SUM 3510, evinced an _unequivocal_ intention to participate in the court proceedings _in preference to arbitration_. I found that it had not evinced such intention.

32     First, I examine the prayers sought in SUM 3510.

33     Prayer 1 was for the Writ to “be set aside on the ground of irregularity pursuant to Order 12 Rule 7(1)(a) of the Rules of Court and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court.”

34     The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant submitted to jurisdiction simply by invoking the ROC and/or inherent jurisdiction of the Singapore Court as part of Prayer 1. I did not accept this. Such an approach falls foul of the Court of Appeal’s criticism of some of the earlier English cases that had placed “an undue premium on procedural subtleties rather than on the substance of the issue at hand” (_Carona_ at \[94\]).

35      _Eagle Star_ is relevant to this point. There, the defendant applied to strike out the indorsement on the writ both pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the English Rules of Court as well as the court’s inherent jurisdiction. That made no difference to the English Court of Appeal’s finding that no step in the proceedings had been taken. Instead, the court focused on the principle of election and whether the defendant had waived his right to an arbitration by taking an unequivocal act with knowledge of the material circumstances. By applying to strike out a very defective statement of claim, the defendants there were not affirming the correctness of court proceedings but rather disaffirming them (see _Eagle Star_ at 361).

36     In the circumstances, whether the prayer cited the ROC or the inherent jurisdiction of the Court mattered less than the substantive question of election. Such citation was “merely an acknowledgment by a defendant that the court has transient jurisdiction over the parties” (_Carona_ at \[100\]).

37     Next, the Plaintiff argued that prayer 2 of SUM 3510 for timelines of further pleadings to be held in abeyance pending the disposal of SUM 3510 indicated that the Defendant had submitted to the court’s jurisdiction. I disagreed. The very form of the prayer was intended to prevent the advance of court proceedings pending the disposal of the procedural challenge. As the Court of Appeal in _Carona_ at \[100\] pointed out, the context in which a prayer is sought is germane in assessing if it constitutes a step. It is abundantly clear that this prayer was intended to restrain and not advance proceedings.

38     I turn next to the grounds that the Defendant raised in its affidavit in support of SUM 3510. To recapitulate, there were three: that (i) the Writ was filed in breach of ROC, O 5 r 6(2) given that the Plaintiff was unrepresented at the time of filing; (ii) the Plaintiff had failed to comply with the State Courts’ pre-action protocol; and (iii) that the SOC did not conform to the usual form without paragraph numbers which made it “not feasible or practical for the Defendant \[to\] respond to such claim(s) or enter a Defence to the same”.[^5] See above, \[6\].

39     On the first ground, I found that the Defendant’s act of taking the application in SUM 3510 on 21 October 2020 did not evince an intention to prefer court proceedings to arbitration. As an unrepresented foreign corporation in breach of ROC, O 5 r 6(2), the Plaintiff could not begin proceedings or be heard in court unless and until leave was obtained for the Plaintiff to be represented by its officer. In those circumstances, the Defendant could not be faulted for making an application to set aside the Writ before applying to stay proceedings pending arbitration.

40     The Plaintiff argued that the fact that the Defendant failed to apply for a stay of proceedings right from the outset revealed its intention to submit to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction. It emphasised that the Defendant had not reserved its right to seek a stay in favour of arbitration throughout the disposal of SUM 3510.

41     While it would have been prudent for the Defendant to have indicated its preference for arbitration at the outset, I did not think that its failure to do so was fatal. The question was whether the act of taking the application in SUM 3510 evinced the requisite intention. I found that it had not. As such, the absence of an additional reservation of rights on the Defendant’s part did not add to the analysis.

42     The more difficult question was whether, by pressing on with the hearing of SUM 3510 on 23 November 2020 when the Plaintiff was already represented by solicitors, the Defendant evinced an unequivocal intention to participate in these proceedings in preference to arbitration.

43     I found that it had not. At this stage, the Writ remained irregular. While the irregularity could be cured by the court, I did not think that the Defendant elected to proceed with court rather than arbitration proceedings simply by proceeding to argue SUM 3510, especially after I found that taking out the application did not constitute such a step in the first place.

44     My decision was fortified by the fact that Plaintiff did not contest the application. It accepted that the Writ was irregular. That would have, in the ordinary course, resulted in the court granting the Defendant’s application and setting aside the Writ. In that eventuality, if and when the Plaintiff brought its fresh action, the Defendant would have been entitled to take its application for a stay in favour of arbitration in any case.

45     The only difference here was that the court had instead decided to exercise its discretion to cure the irregularity as an “efficient way to deal with the matter”.[^6] That should not deprive the Defendant of its right to have the dispute arbitrated in accordance with what the parties had contractually agreed.

46     I move on to the two other complaints cited in the Defendant’s affidavit in support of SUM 3510, i.e. that the Plaintiff had failed to comply with the State Court’s Pre-action protocol and that the SOC was not in the usual form and had no paragraph numbers.

47     The Plaintiff argued that this evinced the Defendant’s intention to participate in court proceedings. In particular, the Plaintiff argued that the objection was based on the Singapore court’s procedural rules. Further, the Defendant’s position in its affidavit that the SOC’s lack of numbering made it “not feasible or practical for the Defendant \[to\] respond to such claim(s) or enter a Defence to the same”[^7] (see above, \[6(c)\]) evinced an intention to do those very acts.

48     This argument gave me pause. The requirements relating to the pre-action protocol or paragraph numbering are not substantive and would not have nullified the Writ or the proceedings. The complaint made by the Defendant also potentially meant that it intended to “respond to such claim(s) or enter a Defence to the same” in court proceedings.

49     However, on balance, I found that the Defendant did not have such an intention. These latter two grounds must be seen in the context of having been made together with the first and primary objection that the Plaintiff was an unrepresented foreign corporation. The unrepresented Plaintiff was unable to comply with basic requirements of court procedure. The existence of these irregularities reflect the rationale for the rule in O 5 r 6(2) – to ensure that the administration of justice is not impeded or prejudiced by allowing untrained and undisciplined persons to conduct litigation on behalf of companies (_Bulk Trading SA v Pevensey Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 538</span> at \[85\]).

50     I emphasise again that the Plaintiff had not contested SUM 3510. It agreed that these were procedural irregularities that it had committed. I do not think that merely by raising them in SUM 3510 together with the first objection, the Defendant had evinced an unequivocal intention to prefer court proceedings to arbitration.

51     Finally, I deal quickly with _PP Persero Sdn Bhd v Bimacom Property & Development Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 6 MLJ 1</span> relied on by the Plaintiff. It can be distinguished on the facts. The defendant there applied for a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration but included a prayer to strike out the action pursuant to Rules of the High Court 1980 (PU(A) 50/1980) (M’sia), O 18 r 19(1). The court found that this prayer would only have been granted if “the case was wholly and clearly unarguable”. In other words, this act challenged the claim on the merits. As such, even though the affidavit in support there failed to specify the grounds for striking out the action, the application was sufficient to constitute a step in the proceedings. This approach is entirely consistent with the approach in _Maniach (CA)_. If a party takes an application pursuant to ROC, O 18 r 19(1) to strike out the action on the merits, such an act constitutes an irrevocable step in the proceedings. However, this is not applicable to the present facts.

52     I deal next with the remaining objections raised by the Plaintiff. I find them without merit.

## Other objections

53     The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant had not raised a dispute to the Plaintiff’s claims which would trigger the operation of the Arbitration Clause. The Defendant submitted that it did not include the substantive content of its defences on the merits in affidavit evidence out of an abundance of caution lest it be accused of disputing the matter on the merits. It relied on _Tiong Very Sumito and others v Antig Investments Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 732</span> at \[49\] for the principle that if it asserted that it disputes or denies the Plaintiff’s claims, such assertion would be sufficient. I find that the Defendant’s assertion on affidavit that it “has a good Defence to the Plaintiff’s claims in the Suit”[^8] has met this requirement.

54     Next, the Plaintiff raised the objection that the Defendant’s alleged wrongful detention of the 1st RMG was a claim in detinue and therefore did not fall within the scope of the Arbitration Clause. However, on the Plaintiff’s own case, the 1st RMG was supplied pursuant to the Agreement. After the Defendant informed the Plaintiff that it was defective, the Plaintiff had sent a replacement. The Plaintiff then claimed that the Defendant did not return the 1st RMG even after receiving the replacement. This is clearly a claim that arose “out of or in connection with \[the\] Agreement” and would _prima facie_ fall within the scope of the Arbitration Clause. That is sufficient for the inquiry at this stage (_Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 373</span> at \[63\] (“_Tomolugen_”)).

55     Finally, the Plaintiff argued that the Arbitration Clause was unenforceable for being “incomplete, ambiguous and/or uncertain”. At this stage, the court needs only to be satisfied that there is a _prima facie_ case of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties (see _Tomolugen_ at \[63\] – \[70\]). This recognises the _kompetenz-kompetenz_ principle that the arbitral tribunal has the jurisdiction to determine the existence and extent of the arbitration agreement that covers the dispute. As the Defendant pointed out, the Arbitration Clause here was the Singapore International Arbitration Centre’s (“**SIAC**”) model clause prior to its revision in 2015. It expressly incorporates the SIAC’s arbitration rules for the time being in force, which contains the requisite mechanism necessary for the due conduct of the arbitration. There is clearly a _prima facie_ case here that the arbitration agreement between the parties is valid.

## Conclusion

56     For the foregoing reasons, I granted the order for all further proceedings in this action to be stayed in favour of arbitration pursuant to IAA, s 6. Costs of the application were fixed at $4,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.
