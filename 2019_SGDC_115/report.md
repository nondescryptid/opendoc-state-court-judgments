\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9090/2019/01.\]

29 May 2019

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Part 1   Charges and Sentence

1       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

DAC 934088/2018 (marked ‘C1B’)

You, Muhammad Faizal Bin Mohamed Salleh, …, Male/29 years, …, are charged that you on 11 October 2018, at about 11.45 p.m., at the void deck of Block 146 Mei Ling Street, Singapore, did voluntarily cause grievous hurt to one Noordilah Binte Fadilah with an instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death; _to wit_, by stabbing her multiple times in the right side of the said Noordilah Binte Fadilah’s body with a knife without handle measuring about 15 cm, causing multiple puncture wounds over the right side of her body, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

MAC 911268/2018 (marked ‘C2B’)

You, Muhammad Faizal Bin Mohamed Salleh, …, Male/29 years, …, are charged that you on 10 September 2018 at or about 7.30 p.m. at Apt Block 872A Tampines Street 86 #XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Aishah Binte Rosli, to wit, by punching the said Aishah Binte Rosli once on her mouth area and left cheek, wrapping your hand around her neck region with force, and holding tightly onto her left bicep, and causing her multiple bruises on her face, neck and bicep, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Part 2   Conviction, Sentence and Appeal

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (marked as ‘P1’) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

3       The Accused then admitted to two other charges and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. These two charges were for:

(a)     Breaking into four pieces the identity card of one Noordilah Binte Fadilah (“Noordilah”), an offence punishable under Section 13(1)(g) of the National Registration Act, Chapter 201; and

(b)     Threatening to cause hurt to the family members and friends of one Aishah Binte Rosli (“Aishah”), with the intent to cause the said Aishah to be alarmed, an offence punishable under Section 3(2) of the Protection against Harassment Act, Chapter 256A.

4       In my deliberation on sentence, I have considered the Prosecution’s written skeletal submissions on sentence (Exhibit ‘P6’) and the Defence’s written mitigation plea (Exhibit ‘D1’).

5       I also heard oral arguments on sentence from the Prosecution and Counsel. At the end, I imposed a sentence of five years and eight strokes of the cane for charge ‘C1B’, the section 326 Penal Code offence (“s 326 PC offence”), and two weeks’ imprisonment for charge ‘C2B’, the section 323 Penal Code offence (“s 323 PC offence). The sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was therefore imprisonment of five years and two weeks and eight strokes of the cane.

6       The Accused was dissatisfied with the said sentences and has filed an appeal against sentence.

7       In this Grounds of Decision, I shall first set out the facts of the case. I will then follow up with the reasons behind my decision to impose a total sentence of five years and two weeks’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.

## Part 3   Facts for DAC 934088/2018 (charge ‘C1B’)

### A   Background

8       The victim in this case was Noordilah, female, 23 years of age at the time she was assaulted by the Accused. The victim was a friend of Aishah and the latter was the Accused’s wife.

9       Noordilah and Aishah came to know each other sometime in 2017. Over time, they became close friends. At one period during her marriage to the Accused, Aishah went to stay with Noordilah between 20 August 2018 and 6 September 2018.

10     On 10 September 2018, which was only four days after she had stayed with Noordilah, Aishah informed the Accused of her intention to file for divorce from him and also to leave the Accused’s residence. The Accused beat up Aishah that day (see paragraphs \[30\] to \[35\] below).

11     On 11 September 2018, Aishah left the Accused’s residence. She went to stay with Noordilah.

12     In mid-September 2018, Aishah blocked the Accused from accessing her Facebook profile page. The Accused then created a fake online profile on Facebook and added Aishah as his ‘friend’ on the online platform. The Accused had done so in order to find out the reason behind Aishah’s for leaving him. The Accused subsequently found out that Aishah was seeing other men. The Accused blamed Noordilah for his broken marriage and for being a bad influence on Aishah. Henceforth, the Accused plotted revenge on Noordilah.

### B   The Accused’s plan and the attack on Noordilah

13     The Accused first obtained access to his friend’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. He represented his friend’s profile picture and social media accounts as his own, using the moniker ‘Boytun Tun’.

14     Using the said false profile, the Accused then befriended Noordilah on Facebook and Instagram. Noordilah was unaware that Accused was the true person behind ‘Boytun Tun’. They communicated with each other till about 10 October 2018 when the Accused, through the use of ‘Boytun Tun’ expressed romantic interest in Noordilah.

15     On 11 October 2018, the Accused, under the guise of ‘Boytun Tun’ sent a request to Noordilah asking to meet her in person after she has finished work that day. Noordilah agreed to the Accused’s request. The Accused then proposed meeting at a barbeque pit located at Blk 186A Queensway. Noordilah agreed.

16     That evening of 11 October 2018, the Accused arrived at the vicinity of Blk 186A Queensway before Noordilah. At about 9:30 p.m., the Accused saw Noordilah arrived at the barbeque pit located at Blk 186A, Queenway.

17     The Accused observed that the barbeque pit area was crowded with passers-by. He then decided to change the meeting place. He messaged Noodilah and pretended that he was unable to find her. He then changed the meeting location to the void deck of Blk 146, Mei Ling Street (“the incident location”.

18     The Accused arrived at the incident location before Noordilah. The time then was about 9:50 p.m. The Accused circled around the block and scoped out the location. He then hid behind a wall and waited for the arrival of Noordilah.

19     Noordilah arrived at the incident location around 10.00 p.m. She sat herself at a stone table. The Accused did not come out to meet her immediately.

20     Noordilah waited at the stone table. At about 10:30 p.m., the Accused came out from behind Noordilah and commence his attack on her. During the attack, the Accused was armed with a 15 cm long knife without a handle. The Accused had attacked Noordilah without any warning. He started the attack by stabbing the right side of Noordilah’s body and her ear region multiple times. Noordilah attempted to defend herself by pulling at Accused’s jacket hood. The Accused and Noordilah fell to the floor during the scuffle.

21     After Noordilah had fallen to the floor, the Accused violently pulled at a brown sling bag that Noordilah was holding. The Accused managed to pull the sling bag away from Noordilah. Noordilah grabbed onto the Accused’s legs with her legs and the Accused repeatedly kicked the Noordilah’s hands. The Accused then pinned Noordilah to the ground. Noordilah screamed for help.

22     The Accused then grabbed what he thought was his mobile phone from the floor and fled from the scene. As he fled from the scene, he discarded the knife he had used to stab Noordilah. He also disposed of his black hooded jacket.

23     The Accused had remained silent throughout the attack. Noordilah was unable to identify her assailant.

24     The attack on Noordilah by the Accused was witnessed by at least five persons, three whom had called either the Police hotline at 999 or the emergency hotline at 995 to report the assault.

### C   Arrest of the Accused and the recovery of incriminating items

25     The Accused escaped to his house at Blk 104 Teck Whye Lane and arrived at about 11:45 p.m. He then realised that the mobile phone he had taken from the incident location was not his; he had taken Noordilah’s mobile phone by mistake. The Accused then proceeded to switch off the mobile phone. The Accused then discarded, amongst other items, the said mobile phone, a pair of black Converse shoes, a pair of bloodstained black denim jeans and a bloodstained black colour T-shirt, at the central block rubbish chute.

26     The Accused was arrested on 12 October 2018 at about 11.00 a.m. He was arrested at his mother’s house. The items that he had discarded at the central block rubbish chute were recovered by the Police.

### D   Injuries sustained by Noordilah

27     Noordilah was conveyed by an ambulance to the National University Hospital (“NUH”). The medical report on Noordilah provided by NUH (Exhibit ‘P2’) revealed that Noordialh has sustained the following injuries:

(a)     Three lacerations on her right ear; 2 through and through lacerations, each about 1.5 cm on the inferior portion of the antihelix and 1 superficial laceration on the posterior border of the lobule and the face. A bedside toilet and suture of these lacerations were performed under sterile technique;

(b)     A superficial laceration 1 cm over the dorsum of the left hand;

(c)     Four (4) cuts over the dorsum of her right hand comprising 2 cuts over thumb pulp, 1 cut over the 1st webspace, 1 cut over the radial border of the index finger; all cuts ranging from 0.5 cm to 2 cm);

(d)     A 2 cm deep cut over the victim’s right lateral elbow;

(e)     A 2 cm superficial cut over the victim’s right medial elbow;

(f)     A right lateral chest wound 3 cm x 2 cm and 2 cm deep;

(g)     Right anterior axillary wound 1 cm x 0.5 cm and 0.5 cm deep (armpit);

(h)     Right posterior axilla wound 2 cm x 1 cm and 4 cm length (armpit);

(i)     Five posterior neck wounds, shallow, 1 cm in length (neck);

(j)     One right anterior shoulder wound, shallow, 2 cm in length; and

(k)     Right haemothorax and pneumothorax.

28     Noordilah was admitted to the hospital’s surgical ward on 12 October 2018. She was discharged on 16 October 2018, and given 23 days of hospitalisation leave from 11 October 2018 to 2 November 2018. At a follow-up appointment, the hospitalisation leave was extended by four more days to 6 November 2018. Due to her injuries, Noordilah was unable to work. Her employer allowed her to return to work after 13 November 2018.

## Part 4   Facts for MAC 934088/2018 (charge ‘C2B’)

29     The victim in this charge is Aishah. At the time of the offence, Aishah was the Accused’s wife.

### A   Assault on Aishah

30     On 10 September 2018, at about 7:30 p.m., Aishah informed the Accused of her intention to seek a divorce in their marriage. She also stated her intention to leave the flat thereafter.

31     The Accused became incensed and punched Aishah on her mouth area and also once on her left cheekbone. The Accused then menacingly wrapped one of his hands around Aishah’s throat such that Aishah was still able to breathe. The Accused also held on tightly to Aishah’s left bicep.

32     Later, the Accused took hold of a knife and told Aishah to kill him. Aishah refused. The Accused calmed down after Aishah promised to be with him and return to the flat every day. The Accused then locked Aishah inside the flat and left after taking the flat’s keys and Aishah’s mobile phone with him.

### B   The day after the assault

33     On 11 September 2018, sometime in the morning between 6 a.m. to 7 a.m., Aishah informed the Accused that she would like to visit her parents after the Accused has gone to work. Aishah assured the Accused that she would return to the flat. The Accused unlocked the door to the flat and left for work. At about 8 a.m., Aishah went to visit her parents. Aishah’s parents observed several marks on Aishah’s skin and queried her. Aishah was encouraged by her parents to lodge a police report.

34     On 11 September 2018, at about 11.04 p.m., Aishah went to Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre and lodged a police report against the Accused.

### C   Injuries sustained by Aishah

35     Aishah was seen by Dr Geraldine Tan of Changi General Hospital on 12 September 2018. In the Medical Form for Complaint of Violence (Exhibit ‘P3’), Dr Geraldine Tan documented the following injuries sustained by Aishah as a result of the attack on her by the Accused:

(a)     A 3 cm irregular-shaped bruise on the victim’s left cheek;

(b)     A 1 cm irregular-shaped bruise on the victim’s lower left inner lip;

(c)     A 2 cm irregular-shaped bruise on the front of the victim’s neck below her chin; and

(d)     A 6 cm by 4 cm irregular-shaped bruise on the underside of the victim’s left bicep.

## Part 5   Sentence

### A   Applicable Sentencing Principles

36     In my judgment, general deterrence in sentencing was applicable to this case. General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender. The use of wanton violence, in addition to harming their immediate victims, also have the wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public. It is in the public interest that a strong message be sent that that the commission of such crimes would be met with a lengthy custodial sentence. See _PP v Law Aik Meng_ at \[24\] – \[25\]. I was therefore in agreement with the Prosecution’s submissions that this case called for a deterrent sentence to quell the public disquiet caused by the vicious attack on Noordilah which was carried out in full view of members of the public.

37     Next, I also held the view that specific deterrence in sentencing was also applicable in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an offender to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _PP v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ at \[25\] – \[29\].

38     Thirdly, I understood the Prosecution’s submissions to be that the retributive principle is an important sentencing consideration in this case. Accordingly, I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that it is important that offenders are punished not just for the physical harm they inflict but also for the life-long trauma, emotional distress and anguish they have callously and cruelly inflicted on their victim: _PP v Murugesan_ at \[55\].

### B   Section 326, PC – A custodial sentence was warranted

39     The Prosecution and Counsel were in agreement that a custodial sentence was warranted for the s 326 PC offence. In my judgment, it is without any doubt that a long custodial sentence was warranted.

### (i)   The indicative starting point for sentencing based on the seriousness of the injury

40     In determining the appropriate sentence, I followed the two-step framework enunciated in _PP v BDB_ (“_BDB_”). The first step was to determine the indicative starting point for sentencing based on the serious of the injury. The second step was to make adjustment for the offender’s culpability by taking into account the relevant aggravating and/or mitigating circumstances.

41     In _BDB_ at \[56\], the Court of Appeal, in dealing with the offence of Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt under s 325 PC, held that:

“… given the inherent mischief that underlies the offence under s 325, and considering that a more severe sentencing range is prescribed for this offence (compared to the offence of voluntarily causing simple hurt under s 323 PC) precisely because _grievous_ hurt has been caused, the factor that should guide the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentencing should be the _seriousness of the hurt caused_ to the victim.” (words in italics as per the judgement).

42     In my judgment, the above sentencing principle is applicable to a s 326 PC offence with equal force as s 326 PC is an aggravated form of the offence under s 325 PC.

43     The Court of Appeal further held that when reviewing the seriousness of the injury sustained by the victim, the sentencing court should have regards to considerations such as the nature and permanence of the injury: _BDB_ at \[58\]. In addition, the sentencing court should have regard to the full breath of the permitted sentencing range: _BDB_ at \[59\].

44     In _BDB_, the Court of Appeal provided the following indicative starting points for a s 325 PC offence:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="10.0620124024805%"> <col width="47.0094018803761%"> <col width="42.9285857171434%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Section 325 Penal Code</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Seriousness of Injury</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative Starting Points</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">I</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Death is caused</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eight – ten years’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">II</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Multiple fractures of a serious nature (with reference to the 6<sup>th</sup> charge in <em>BDB</em>)</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment of three years and six months or more</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

45     Given that the maximum punishment permitted for a s 326 PC offence is imprisonment for life, or imprisonment up to 15 years, the above indicative starting points would have to be adjusted upwards accordingly.

46     I have observed that under Band I, where death is caused under s 325 PC, the indicating start point was pegged at the 80th percentile mark of the maximum prescribed punishment. Hence, adopting the same Band I and using the 80th percentile mark, we would get the lower end of the indicative starting point at 12 years’ imprisonment for a s 326 PC offence. Needless to say, the upper limit of the indicative starting point would be 15 years’ imprisonment.

47     I have also observed that under Band II, the indicative starting point was pegged at the 35th percentile mark of the maximum prescribed punishment under s 325 PC. Hence, adopting the same Band II and using the 35th percentile mark, we would get the indicative starting point at approximately 5 years’ imprisonment, rounded downwards to the nearest year, for a s 326 PC offence. A review of some case precedents would provide support for adopting this indicative sentence point for Band II.

48     The case precedents reviewed were: _PP v Neo Aik You_ (CC 27/2001), _PP v Wong Guoliang_ and _PP v Mohamad Yazit Bin Abdullah_ (SC-913140-2016).

(a)      _PP v Neo Aik You_

The victim was hit on the back of her head by an axe welded by the accused. The victim sustained a 7 cm laceration over the occiput. She also had bilateral hematoma, left subconjunctival haemorrhage, a depressed fracture and a comminuted left parieto-occiptal fracture with associated underlying cerebral contusion. The prosecution proceeded against the accused under s 326 PC and the accused pleaded guilty. The accused was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment.

This is a 2001 case where the maximum prescribed punishment then for an offence under s 326 PC was imprisonment for life or imprisonment up to ten years’ imprisonment. The maximum prescribed punishment was raised by Amendment Act 51 of 2007 to imprisonment for life, or imprisonment up to 15 years. The said amendment took effect from 1 February 2008. In my opinion, the sentence in _PP v Neo Aik You_ would have been higher the current sentencing regime.

(b)      _PP v Wong Guoliang_

The victim was slashed with a parang at his abdomen area, his right arm, right check, left upper back and right forehead area. The injuries as documented by the hospital showed:

i.       a penetrating abdominal wound;

ii.       a 15 cm laceration on the right arm;

iii.       a 5 cm laceration on the right cheek;

iv.       a 4 cm laceration on the left upper back over the scapula spine

v.       a right front bone fracture involving the outer table of the skull, with a 10 cm overlying right frontal laceration.

The accused was sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment and 9 strokes of the cane.

(c)      _PP v Mohamad Yazit Bin Abdullah_

The accused faced several charges. For the purpose of this discussion, I shall only be focusing on the s 326 PC offence and the injuries sustained by the victim.

The accused used a bread knife to attack the victim; slashing the victim with the bread knife over the neck, right chest and left neck. The victim was found to have sustained:

i.       a deep zone II laceration on the right neck extending from the angle of the mandible to the midline with active bleeding from the right external jugular vein which was ligated; and

ii.       superficial lacerations on left side of the neck and right chest.

The victim also underwent a concurrent left hand debridement and repair of cut structures to his left hand.

The victim was warded for eight days and given a total of 30 days hospitalization leave. Taken together, the victim was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits for at 38 days.

The accused was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.

49     The table below presents the discussion in \[46\] – \[48\] in a simplified form.

50     At this juncture, I would like to make an observation. A District Court can only impose an imprisonment term of up to ten years when sentencing offences under the Penal Code. This is unlike section 53 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, Rev Edn 2008) (“the MDA”) which specifically empowers a District Court to impose the full penalty or punishment in respect of any offence provided by the MDA except the punishment of death.

51     Before setting out the indicative starting point for the present case, I am mindful of the following observation of the Court of Appeal in _BDB_:

41    As stated in Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“Sentencing Practice”) at p 266, the facts and circumstances of each offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt vary considerably, and each case must be evaluated based on its own particular facts:

The different forms of grievous hurt vary in their seriousness. For example, permanent privation of sight or a bodily part would be more serious than a simple fracture. The Penal Code (Amendment) Act \[(Act 51 of 2007)\] expanded the definition of ‘grievous hurt’ by including ‘death’ and ‘penetration of the vagina or anus’ as categories of grievous hurt. Clearly, where death has been caused …, the imposition of a higher sentence must be considered. In general, the factors that would dominate sentence are the degree of deliberation; the extent and duration of the attack; the nature of the injury; and the use of a weapon (the dangerousness of it). The obvious aggravating factors would be premeditation, a lengthy application of violence, group assault, significant injuries, permanence of injuries, the use of a weapon, a young or otherwise vulnerable victim, abuse of position, and previous convictions … \[emphasis added\]

52     In the present, the seriousness of the injuries suffered by Noordilah would not fall within either Bands of the Table at \[49\]. However, I have taken note that Noordilah was given 27 days of hospitalisation leave and thereafter her employer allowed her to commence work seven days after the end of her hospitalisation leave. Noordilah was thus unable to follow her ordinary pursuits for 34 days. Any hurt which causes the sufferer to be, during the space of 20 days, unable to follow his ordinary pursuits is designated as grievous hurt: s 320(h) PC. Noordilah was unable to follow her ordinary pursuits for almost twice the prescribed length as set out in s 320(h) PC. In _PP v Mohamad Yazit Bin Abdullah_ (SC-913140-2016), the victim was unable to follow his ordinary pursuit for 38 days. In my judgment, for the present case, the indicative starting point for sentencing ought to be four years’ imprisonment.

53     Counsel for the Accused has referred to numerous case precedents from the District Courts. I found these case precedents to be unhelpful for three reasons :

(a)     Firstly, majority of the cases cited predated the amendment to s 326 PC by Amendment Act 51 of 2007 where the maximum prescribed sentence for s 326 PC was increased from ten years imprisonment to 15 years’ imprisonment or life imprisonment.

(b)     Secondly, in _PP v Lim See Yong_ , _PP v Hamzah Bin Hamid_ and _PP v Muraleindran s/o Thoondy and Others_ , the respective District Judges relied on case precedents that predated the amendment to s 326 PC and failed to have regard to the full breath of the permitted sentencing range under the new regime.

(c)     Thirdly, none of the case precedents cited followed the two-step sentencing framework provided in _BDB_.

### (ii)   Culpability of the Accused – Adjustment upwards for aggravating factors

54     Ascertaining the culpability of the offender would involve an assessment of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by the offender’s actions. The factors to be considered involve the extent of deliberation; the manner in which the assault was carried out; the duration of the attack; the vulnerability of the victim; the use of any weapon, _etc_, amongst other factors: see _BDB_ at \[62\].

55     In the present case, the Accused had the cunning to use social media to get into contact with the victim. The use of the social media platform allowed enabled him to hide his true identity from the victim. For over a month, he was patient in his romantic seduction of the victim. And ultimately, he managed to lure the victim out to meet him in person. He then armed himself with a knife in order to carry out his attack. When he observed that the initial location was not suitable for his plan, he was quick to make up his mind and change his plan. He lied to the victim that he could not find her and then suggested meeting her at the incident location. Thereafter, he proceeded to the incident location before the victim’s arrival. He reconnoitred the place to seek out a place where the victim could not see him. When the victim arrived, he waited again before launching a sudden attack on the victim with a knife. Repeating the words of the Prosecution, “the accused also took carefully calculated steps to put the victim at ease and to put himself in a position where he could exploit that trust to execute his plan of assaulting her.” I accept in full, the arguments made by the Prosecution on the various aggravating factors applicable to this case: see Prosecution’s skeletal submissions on sentence (Exhibit ‘P6’) at \[14\] to \[38\]). The presence of these aggravating factors warrants uplifting the indicative starting sentence.

56     I have carefully considered the Accused’s mitigation plea (Exhibit ‘D1’). Other than the fact that he has pleaded guilty, the rest of the Accused’s mitigation plea (see Exhibit D1 at \[1\], \[3\] – \[11\] and \[29\] – \[34\]) carried no or very little mitigating value.

57     With respect to the Accused’s plea of guilt, little weight should be given as I found that the evidence against him is strong and he has little choice but to plead guilty: _BDB_ at \[74\]. In the same passage (i.e. _BDB_ at \[74\]), the Court of Appeal has also stated that “the offender’s co-operation with the investigating authorities should not be regarded as strong mitigating factor if there is overwhelming evidence against him”.

58     The aggravating factors present in this case far outweighed the accused’s plea of guilt. Taking into the account the Accused’s high degree of culpability, an uplift of one year’s imprisonment was added to the indicative starting point to arrive at a sentence of five years’ imprisonment.

### C   Caning

59     In _BDB_, at \[76\], the Court of Appeal stated that held that where violence has been inflicted on a victim, retribution is likely to be the principal sentencing consideration that warrants the imposition of caning. The Court of Appeal went to provide a sentencing framework on the issue of caning: where non-fatal serious injury is caused, a sentence of between six and 12 strokes of the cane may be considered. In the present case, given that the offence is one under s 326 PC and that a knife was used in the attack, I found that the imposition of 8 strokes of the cane was warranted.

60     In conclusion, the sentence passed on the Accused for the s 326 PC offence was an imprisonment term of 5 years with 8 strokes of the cane.

### D   Section 323, PC – A custodial sentence was warranted

61     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least two week’s imprisonment for the commission of this offence. Counsel submitted for a fine of not more than $1000/-_._

62     Applying the two-step sentencing framework described in \[40\] above to the factual matrix of the s 323 PC offence, I was in agreement with the Prosecution’s submission that a sentence of imprisonment was warranted.

63     Counsel made his case for the imposition of a fine based primarily on the level of harm caused. I was not persuaded by Counsel’s submissions. I found that Counsel has completely failed to address the issue of culpability of the Accused.

64     Whilst this court can empathise with the Accused when Aishah sought a divorce from him, it must be emphasised that this does not provide him with a lawful excuse to use physical violence on Aishah. There was no attempt on the part of the Accused to get Aishah to reconsider her decision or to discuss the matter. The Accused simply lashed out with the use of physical violence at Aishah’s head, face and neck. It was a one-sided attack with the Accused having the upper hand.

65     After the assault, the Accused locked Aishah in the flat and took with him the house keys, restricting Aishah’s freedom. He also took away Aishah’s phone. Lastly, I took into consideration the Accused’s admission to a charge for an offence under section 3(2) of the Protection From Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (see paragraph \[3(a)\] above). The presence of these aggravating factors makes for a stronger case for the imposition of a custodial sentence.

66     I did not find any genuine remorse on the part of the Accused. I did not agree with Counsel’s submission that the Accused has committed this offence (and the s 326 PC offence) “_out of his undying love for his wife_”. It is totally illogical that the use of physical violence to deal with a matrimonial matter can be a form of love.

67     The evidence against the Accused was overwhelming and thus the Accused’s plea of guilt was insufficient to justify the imposition of a fine.

68     For the reasons given, I imposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for the s 323 PC offence.

### E   Sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively

69     The s 326 PC and s 323 PC offences were clearly distinct offences. The two offences were committed on different dates and against different victims. As such, it would be proper to run the individual sentences consecutively. This would also be in line with the one-transaction rule and the totality principle (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ at \[25\].

## Part 6   Conclusion

70     For the reasons given above, the total sentence was therefore five years and two weeks’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.
