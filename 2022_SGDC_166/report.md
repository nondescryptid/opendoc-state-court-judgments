### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       The defendant Wang Zhihao is a 20-year-old Chinese national. On the evening of 1 August 2020, when he was 18 years old, he and four friends met at his apartment and consumed alcohol. One was his schoolmate, a 19-year-old girl (the “**Victim**”). The other three (two males and a female) were his friends. The Victim consumed multiple shots of liquor and became severely intoxicated. After the other three friends subsequently left the apartment, the defendant locked his room door, leaving only he and the Victim in his room. At some point, she passed out while on his bed. He slipped his hand underneath her shorts and panties, and squeezed lubricating gel over her vaginal area. He then slipped a vibrator underneath her shorts and panties, and left the vibrator in contact with the outside of her vagina to try to “stimulate” her. He then penetrated her vagina with his middle finger. He stopped less than 10 seconds later when she briefly regained consciousness.

2       She subsequently lodged a police report, and he was arrested and charged for the sexual assault. On 11 March 2022 he pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual assault by penetration, an offence under s 376(2)(a) and punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”). One other charge was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

3       On 30 June 2022, he was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane. The defence, which had sought a sentence of reformative training, filed the present appeal against the sentence the same day.

4       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charge

5       The defendant pleaded guilty to the following charge (which is redacted to protect the identity of the Victim):

> DAC-913952-2021

> You \[…\] are charged that you, sometime between 11 pm on 1 August 2020 and 1.30am on 2 August 2020, at \[the defendant’s apartment in Singapore\], did sexually penetrate, with your finger, the vagina of \[the Victim\], without her consent, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which offence is punishable under s 376(3) of the said Act.

6       Section 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code provided as follows:

> Any man (_A_) who – sexually penetrates, with a part of _A_’s body (other than _A_’s penis) or anything else, the vagina or anus, as the case may be, of another person (_B_) \[…\] shall be guilty of an offence if _B_ did not consent to the penetration or if _B_ is below 14 years of age, whether _B_ did or did not consent to the penetration.

7       Under s 376(3) of the Penal Code, a person who is guilty of such offence shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

8       An offence under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code is ordinarily triable in the General Division of the High Court. The present case was heard in the District Court following an application by the prosecution under s 9(3)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code for the offence to be tried in a District Court[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1), and with the defendant’s consent[^2].

### Facts

9       These were the salient facts relating to the charge.

10     On the evening of 1 August 2020, the defendant, the Victim and three other friends of the defendant met for drinks at the defendant’s apartment.

11     The Victim arrived at about 8.40 pm. The defendant and the other three were inside his bedroom consuming alcohol. The Victim joined the group and drank with them. They shared a bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label whiskey and a bottle of Absolut Vodka. The Victim consumed multiple shots of liquor and became severely intoxicated.

12     Sometime between 10.00 and 10.30 pm, the Victim entered the ensuite toilet of the defendant’s room to vomit. She remained in the toilet for about 20 minutes and did not respond when the defendant knocked on the door. At about 11.00 pm, he forcefully opened the toilet door as he was concerned about her. He saw her slumped over the toilet bowl with her face on the toilet seat. He knew by this point that she was severely intoxicated. Soon after, his three other friends left, and he locked his room door. Only he and the Victim were left in his room at this point.

13     A short while later, he heard her vomit again and saw that she had vomited all over the toilet floor. She weakly asked him to get her handphone to call her boyfriend to fetch her. He did not do so as he could not find her handphone. Instead, he pulled her up from the floor, and threw her face down on his bed, with her lower body hanging off the bed. She was wearing a yellow hooded sweatshirt and a pair of baggy shorts. The defendant again heard her telling him to call her boyfriend to pick her up and send her home, but he was unable to find her handphone. Shortly after that, she lost consciousness as a result of her severe intoxication. The defendant was aware that she had lost consciousness.

14     It was sometime between 11.00 pm on 1 August 2020 and 1.30 am on 2 August 2020. The defendant took a small bottle of lubricating gel, slipped his hand underneath the Victim’s shorts and panties from the bottom, and squeezed the gel over her vaginal area. He then took a vibrator and slipped it underneath her shorts and panties, with the intention of inserting the vibrator into her vagina to “stimulate” her, as he felt that she was “still very dry”. However, as her panties were too tight, he left the vibrator in contact with the outside of her vagina for a few seconds instead, before removing it.

15     He then slipped his left hand underneath her shorts and panties and inserted approximately 2 to 4 cm of his middle finger into her vagina. He moved his finger back and forth in her vagina for less than 10 seconds. He knew that she, by reason of her intoxication and consequent unconsciousness, was incapable of consenting to his penetration of her vagina with his finger.

16     The Victim briefly regained consciousness at this point. In her dazed state, she felt the defendant’s finger inside her vagina. She weakly asked him to call her boyfriend, before losing consciousness again. On hearing this, the defendant retracted his finger from her vagina as he knew that he had done wrong. He did not help her to call her boyfriend as he still could not find her handphone. He subsequently masturbated and ejaculated before falling asleep.

17     At about 4.00 am, the Victim woke up. She found herself on the defendant’s bed and saw him sleeping next to her. She discovered that her panties had been pulled down to just above her knees, while her shorts were under the blanket near him. After wearing her panties and shorts, she shook the defendant to wake him, and asked for her handphone. At about 4.39 am, after finding her phone, she left the apartment and took a taxi home. Enroute, she messaged her boyfriend and told him that she had been molested. She and her boyfriend returned to the defendant’s apartment at about 5.40 am to confront the defendant. He denied sexually assaulting her.

18     The Victim lodged a police report on 3 August 2020 at about 2.13 am, and the defendant was arrested later that day.

## Sentencing

### Charge taken into consideration

19     The defendant admitted to another charge, which was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. This charge related to his placing a vibrator inside the Victim’s panties and on her vagina, intending to outrage her modesty, an offence punishable under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. (MAC-906397-2021)

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

20     The prosecution sought a sentence of 6 to 7 years imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) It was submitted that general deterrence and retribution, rather than rehabilitation, were the dominant sentencing considerations in the present case. The offence of sexual assault by penetration is an extremely serious offence. It is one of the most grievous forms of intrusion of a female’s bodily integrity and an affront to her dignity. The defendant callously exploited the Victim’s vulnerability for his own gratification. Rehabilitation, as a sentencing consideration, had been entirely eclipsed by deterrence and retribution. Reformative training and probation were inappropriate sentencing options, given the overriding impetus of deterrence and retribution. (The prosecution’s submissions on the sentence are considered in more detail below at \[29\]-\[31\].)

### Plea in Mitigation and Defence’s Further Submissions

21     The defence submitted, on the other hand, that rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration, and a sentence of reformative training was more appropriate than imprisonment.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) The defendant was only 18 years old at the time of the offence. He was deeply regretful and remorseful for his actions, and pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. He unconditionally confessed to his misdeeds when arrested by the police, and was cooperative and truthful during investigations. This was his first brush with the law. His actions were at odds with his generally good character. He had stayed on the straight and narrow ever since his arrest. He demonstrated a strong propensity for rehabilitation.[^5]

22     While the defence acknowledged that sexual assault by penetration was a serious offence, it was submitted that, on the facts of the case, the presumption of rehabilitation had not been displaced. The offence was committed in a moment of youthful impulsiveness and within a short span of time. The duration of penetration was short, less than 10 seconds. It was not a premeditated offence.

### Sentencing considerations

#### Framework for sentencing of young offenders

23     The sentencing of a young offender involves two distinct but related stages, as explained by the High Court in _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“**_Boaz Koh_**”) at \[28\]:

> It is well established that when a court sentences a youthful offender, it approaches the task in two distinct but related stages (_PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> \[…\] at \[77\]–\[78\]). At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.

24     The two stages of the sentencing process are:

> (a)     Stage 1: to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations; and

> (b)     Stage 2: to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet the sentencing considerations.

#### Stage 1: Identifying the primary sentencing considerations

25     In the sentencing of a young offender, the primary sentencing consideration would generally be rehabilitation. But, as explained in _Boaz Koh_ at \[30\], rehabilitation is neither singular nor unyielding, and the focus on rehabilitation can be diminished or even eclipsed by such considerations as deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant:

> But rehabilitation is neither singular nor unyielding. The focus on rehabilitation can be diminished or even eclipsed by such considerations as deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant. Broadly speaking, this happens in cases where (a) the offence is serious, (b) the harm caused is severe, (c) the offender is hardened and recalcitrant, or (d) the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable.

26     In the present case, the offence of digital sexual penetration without consent, under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code, is clearly a very serious offence. It is a grievous form of assault and a gross violation of the person. The severity of the offence is reflected in the prescribed punishment, under s 376(3) of the Penal Code. An offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and is also liable to a fine or to caning. It is an offence ordinarily triable in the High Court. Under the sentencing guidelines laid down by the Court of Appeal (discussed below at \[29\]), the indicative starting sentencing range for such offences is 7 to 10 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. This applies to offences at the lowest band of severity. In a case decided by the High Court (discussed below at \[31\], \[33\]), an 18-year-old male offender, who had no prior convictions and pleaded guilty to a similar offence of digitally-penetrating an 18-year-old female friend who was intoxicated, was sentenced to 5½ years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

27     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that general deterrence and retribution, rather than rehabilitation, were the dominant sentencing considerations in the present case. Despite the offender’s young age, rehabilitation must yield to general deterrence and retribution given the serious nature of the offence. The sentence must reflect society's abhorrence of such offences, and deter likeminded offenders.

#### Stage 2: Selecting the appropriate sentence

28     Having determined the primary sentencing considerations to be deterrence and retribution, I next considered the appropriate sentence to meet those considerations.

29     The sentencing approach for the offence of sexual penetration of the vagina using a finger was laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Pram Nair v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> (“**_Pram Nair_**”). There are three sentencing bands, each with a different indicative starting sentencing range (_Pram Nair_ at \[159\] read with \[119\] and \[122\]). These are summarised in the following table:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="52.78%"><col width="47.22%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 1 – there are no offence-specific aggravating factors or where the factor(s) are only present to a very limited extent and therefore should have a limited impact on the sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 to 10 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 2 - there are two or more offence-specific aggravating factors</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 3 - the number and intensity of the aggravating factors present an extremely serious case</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

30     The prosecution submitted that the present case fell within Band 1. It was further submitted that the defendant’s exploitation of the Victim’s vulnerability was an offence-specific aggravating factor (_Pram Nair_ at \[126\]-\[127\]). The Victim was severely intoxicated to the point of unconsciousness, and entirely unable to resist his sexual assault. The presence of the offence-specific aggravating factor placed the present case squarely in the middle of Band 1, with an indicative starting sentence of 8 to 9 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. The TIC charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code was an offender-specific aggravating factor, and would in general lead to an uplift of the sentence. The prosecution accepted, however, that there were offender-specific mitigating factors: the defendant’s plea of guilt, his young age and clean record. Taking both the aggravating and mitigating factors, the prosecution submitted that an overall downward adjustment of the indicative sentence to 6 to 7 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane would be appropriate.

31     The prosecution cited the decision of the High Court in _PP v Muhammad Rezky Saputra Bin Joeffry_ (CC 53 of 2019) (“**_Rezky_**”).[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) The offender, an 18-year-old male, pleaded guilty to a charge of digitally-penetrating his intoxicated 18-year-old female friend. He was sentenced to 5½ years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. Like the present defendant, the offender in _Rezky_ was young, untraced and pleaded guilty. Nonetheless, the High Court held that that given the circumstances of the case, the focus on rehabilitation was eclipsed by the need for deterrence and retribution. The High Court noted that the victim was intoxicated, exhausted and asleep throughout the digital penetration by the offender; and that the vulnerability of the victim was an offence-specific aggravating factor. The prosecution submitted that the sentence for the present defendant ought to be higher than in _Rezky_ as there was a TIC charge of outrage of modesty that was intrinsically linked to the proceeded charge: he had stimulated the Victim’s vagina with a vibrator in order to facilitate his subsequent digital penetration of her.

32     The defence agreed that, as a starting point, the present case fell within Band 1 of the sentencing framework set out in _Pram Nair_. It was submitted, however, that the starting point should then be reduced by about _half_ on account of the defendant’s early plea of guilt, genuine remorse, lack of antecedents, and his young age. Accordingly, the defence suggested a sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment with 2 strokes of the cane.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

33     The defence submitted that _Rezky_ was a far more aggravated case of sexual assault by penetration than the present case. The offence in _Rezky_ was committed with premeditation and conspiracy, while the present defendant’s offence was committed impulsively on the spur of the moment. The offence in _Rezky_ took place in the context of a group assault on the vulnerable victim by multiple offenders, while the present defendant’s offence was an isolated, one-off incident. The offender in _Rezky_ penetrated the victim’s vagina with his finger for several minutes, while the present defendant’s offence occurred for less than 10 seconds. The offender in _Rezky_ tried to evade detection of his offences, while the present defendant was cooperative with the authorities from the outset.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) Hence the defence submitted that the sentence in the present case ought to be lower than the sentence in _Rezky_.

34     I accepted the submission of the prosecution and defence that, as a starting point, the present case fell within Band 1 of the _Pram Nair_ sentencing framework. I also accepted that there ought to be a downward adjustment from the indicative starting sentence, mainly on account of the defendant’s young age, and also taking into account his plea of guilt and prior clean record as mitigating factors.

35     I found the case of _Rezky_ to be a helpful reference point in calibrating the sentence, given that the offender in _Rezky_ and the present defendant were both 18 years old at the time of offending, pleaded guilty, had a clean criminal record, and committed the offence against an intoxicated victim. Comparing the facts of both cases, however, I agreed with the defence (above, at \[33\]) that _Rezky_ was a more aggravated case of sexual assault by penetration. The culpability of the offender in _Rezky_ was significantly higher than the present defendant (even after considering the TIC charge of outrage of modesty). Accordingly, it would be fair and just that the present defendant received a lower sentence than in _Rezky_.

36     In my judgment, an appropriate sentence for the present defendant was about 4 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane. This was 1½ years shorter than the imprisonment term in _Rezky_, in line with the defendant’s relatively lower culpability. For a young offender, such a sentence would appropriately meet the need for deterrence and retribution, without being unduly crushing on his prospects of rehabilitation.

#### Reformative training not an appropriate sentence

37     In the course of sentencing, a pre-sentence report for reformative training was called. Reformative training was one of the sentencing options that the defence had urged the court to consider. In the _Pre-Sentencing Report for Reformative Training_ dated 4 April 2022 (the “**RTC Report**”), the defendant was found to be physically and mentally suitable to undergo the reformative training regime. The report concluded that:

> \[The defendant’s\] intervention needs include increasing his insight into his maladaptive coping strategy (specifically his alcohol use) and developing alternative coping strategies, and increasing his insight into his triggers and motivation for his offences. Furthermore, while he had taken steps to mitigate his risk of reoffending in the community, intervention can also aim to refine his risk management strategies to ensure they are viable in the long-term.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

The report went on to recommend that he undergo “Level 1 intensity of rehabilitation” if sentenced to reformative training.

38     In submitting for a sentence of reformative training, the defence cited the case of _PP v Lim Jing Wei_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 177</span> (“**_Lim Jing Wei_**”). In that case, the 20-year-old offender pleaded guilty to one charge of sexual assault by penetration and had one further charge of attempted rape taken into consideration for sentencing. The defence submitted that the facts in _Lim Jing Wei_ were more egregious. Against the victim’s will and despite her repeated rejections of his advances, the offender kissed the victim, removed her top and bra, removed her shorts, pulled her underwear to one side, and inserted his finger in and out of her vagina a few times. After that, he asked the victim to masturbate him and grabbed her hand and placed it on top of his exposed penis. He also asked the victim to keep her hand on his penis while he fell asleep. The victim suffered significant harm and was diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. She suffered from panic attacks and suicidal thoughts for which she had to seek medical treatment. The offender in _Lim Jing Wei_ was traced, including for offences of misappropriation of property and rioting, and had been sentenced to detention barracks during National Service. The defence highlighted that despite the more egregious factual matrix in _Lim Jing Wei_, the offender was sentenced by the District Court to 6 months’ reformative training.[^10]

39     I noted that, while the acts committed by the offender in _Lim Jing Wei_ were indeed egregious, he was assessed by a government psychologist to have “harboured cognitive distortions that contributed to his perception that the victim was a willing party” and “he assumed that she was willing as she did not leave the room”.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) The present case, however, was different. The Victim was intoxicated and unconscious; she did not and could not have consented to the sexual acts committed by the defendant on her. The defendant knew that, and preyed on her state of vulnerability. As was explained in _Pram Nair_ at \[126\]-\[127\], an intoxicated victim is in a position of vulnerability in relation to a sexual offender; the victim might be physically weak or suffer lapses in consciousness, and would be in less of a condition to resist any sexual assault; and this factor aggravates the offence. The aggravating factor of the victim’s intoxication was not present in _Lim Jing Wei_. I found _Lim Jing Wei_ to be less helpful and relevant as a precedent than _Rezky_, where the facts were more similar to the present case.

40     Additionally, the prosecution highlighted that the defendant’s status as a non-resident foreigner meant that the conditions did not exist to make reformative training viable: _Boaz Koh_ at \[30\] (reproduced above, at \[25\]). His student permit was revoked after he was charged, and his special pass would expire upon the completion of the present criminal proceedings. He had no locally resident relatives who were in a position to supervise him effectively. The absence of familial support severely undermined his rehabilitative prospects. As a non-resident foreigner, he would be unable to undergo the supervision phase of a sentence of reformative training. Generally, for a foreign national having no family in Singapore, probation and reformative training would not be viable because of the absence of a suitable protective environment: _Boaz Koh_ at \[33\].

### Sentence imposed

41     Accordingly, given that reformative training was not a suitable sentencing option, the defendant was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment and 2 strokes of the cane. The sentence was backdated to take effect from the date of his arrest on 3 August 2020 and to take into account the periods of his remand.

42     The execution of the sentence has been stayed, and he is on bail pending the appeal.
