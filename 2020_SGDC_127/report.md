### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction

1       This is the plaintiff’s claims for injuries that he sustained from a fall from a ladder while at work. His claims were raised against his employer, the first defendant, and against the main contractors and occupiers of the construction site where he worked. The main contractors and occupiers of the construction site were the second and third defendants, who, at the time of the construction project, were partners of the joint venture, Samsung-Koh Brothers Joint Venture. (The second and third defendants are hereinafter to be referred to collectively as “JV”). The first defendant was one of the JV’s many independent subcontractors for this project.

2       It is not disputed that the plaintiff had initially made a claim before the Ministry of Manpower under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Cap 354, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WICA”) and had obtained an award.[^1] However, the plaintiff did not accept the compensation awarded there. Instead, the plaintiff brought his claims before the present court, claiming against the first defendant and the JV.

## Facts

### The parties

3       The plaintiff is an Indian national who was employed by the first defendant as a construction worker from 20 November 2016 to 27 March 2017. At the material time, he was assigned to work at the construction site at or around Changi Coast Road (“the Workplace”).

4       The first defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore and whose principal activity is described as “civil engineering work & environment solution”.[^2] It was the employer of the plaintiff at the material time, and also a subcontractor of the JV.

5       The JV, constituted by the second and third defendants, was the main contractor and the occupier of the Workplace.

### The accident

6       The plaintiff and the first defendant did not dispute that on 14 March 2017, the plaintiff was instructed to install zinc roofing sheets on the scaffold frame sheltering a container and a generator at the Workplace.[^3] However, the first defendant averred that the instruction to do that was issued to the plaintiff _and_ his co-worker, Mr Raman Danabal, and not just to the plaintiff.

7       According to the plaintiff, the zinc roofing sheets that the plaintiff was handling that day were made of iron,[^4] about 5m in length,[^5] and weighed about 30kg each.[^6] These sheets were to be over the scaffold frame, which scaffold frame was over the generator and container which were side by side.[^7] The plaintiff agreed that the height of the container was about 2.5m.[^8] The plaintiff further agreed that given the height or length of the container and the zinc roofing sheet, when the roofing sheet is placed against the container, the roofing sheet would rise above the top of the container by about another 2.5m.[^9]

8       At about 9.15am as the plaintiff was carrying out the said task and “standing in the middle of the ladder, on its third or fourth rung, …the ladder suddenly wobbled”.[^10] This caused the plaintiff to lose his balance and he fell onto the “concrete ground”.[^11] As a result of the fall, the plaintiff was injured on his left arm and back. It was not disputed that at the time of the accident, there was nobody holding the ladder.

9       The plaintiff sued the first defendant and the JV for a breach of their statutory and common law duty of care “in their capacity as employers of the Plaintiff”.[^12]

10     The plaintiff further sued the JV in their capacity as main contractors and occupiers of the Workplace.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s case

11     It was the plaintiff’s pleaded case that when he was instructed to install the zinc roofing sheets on the scaffold frame, he was “required to use a ladder… leaning against the container as his work platform to carry out the task”.[^13] In his affidavit, the plaintiff deposed that his supervisor provided him with a ladder to carry out the task.[^14]

12     He further deposed in his affidavit that “\[a\]t the time of the accident, there was nobody holding the ladder and nobody on top of the container to receive the zinc roofing sheets.”[^15] In fact, when it was put to him by counsel for the first defendant, the plaintiff did not deny that no one saw him fall down the ladder.[^16] He even confirmed that “there was nobody standing nearby \[_sic_\] me”.[^17]

13     Whilst the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim[^18] was silent as to whether there was anyone at the top of the container to receive the zinc roofing sheets from him, it did state that there was no one “stationed at the foot of the ladder to prevent the ladder from slipping”.[^19]

14     The plaintiff claimed to be standing on the third or fourth rung of the ladder when he fell.[^20] In his Statement of Claim, it was stated that he fell from a height of 1.8 metres. Consequently, he sustained injuries which included intervertebral disc bulges and elbow and wrist contusions with their attendant pain and disabilities.

15     The plaintiff sued the first defendant and the JV for negligence and for their breaching the statutory safety requirements provided in the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WSHA”) and its subsidiary legislation.

16     Further and/or in the alternative, the plaintiff sued the JV “as the main contractors and occupiers of the \[Workplace\] in failing to take any or any reasonable care to remedy any unsafe work systems or practices… which they knew or ought to know in relation to the breaches…”.[^21]

### The first defendant’s case

17     It was the first defendant’s case that its supervisor, Mr Sukhjiwan Singh instructed both the plaintiff and his co-worker, Mr Raman Danabal, to install the zinc roofing sheets on the scaffold frames.[^22] They were therefore to work together.

18     Further, despite what the plaintiff averred, the first defendant raised the defence that there was no requirement and no instruction to the plaintiff “to use a ladder as a “work platform” to carry out the task”.[^23] The first defendant explained why:[^24]

> … each roofing sheet can be held up by a worker while standing on the concrete ground surface, and lifted up to and received by another co-worker standing on the container roof, because each zinc roofing sheet measured 5 metres in length and far exceeded the height of the container of 2.57 metres…

19     It was also the first defendant’s case that toolbox meetings “which related to health and safety for its workers (including the Plaintiff)”[^25] were conducted on a daily basis. According to the first defendant, the workers were specifically briefed and instructed on, _inter alia_, the “buddy system” when using ladders.[^26] This required them “to involve another co-worker who would hold onto the ladder for adequate handhold”.[^27] That was why the first defendant had assigned Mr Raman Danabal to work with the plaintiff.

20     In this regard, Mr Raman Danabal affirmed an affidavit on 5 January 2018 in support of the first defendant’s case[^28] that he was instructed to work with the plaintiff by being at the roof of the container to receive the zinc roofing sheets from the plaintiff who would pass them to him from below. However, this court was apprised that Mr Raman Danabal left Singapore on or around 30 October 2018. The plaintiff therefore did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him.

21     To counter Mr Raman Danabal’s affidavit, the plaintiff placed before the court the testimony of Mr Avtar Singh (“PW2”). It was PW2’s testimony that around the period of 14 March 2017, he was operating an excavator at the taxiway of the Workplace which was “more than a kilometer away from \[the first defendant’s\] store/office”.[^29] (The store or office was where the plaintiff’s accident happened.) Mr Raman Danabal was “required to assist throughout the working day at the taxiway construction works” as banksman.[^30] However, this was refuted by the first defendant’s witness, its director Mr Gwyn Neo Zheng (“DW1”), who deposed in his supplementary affidavit[^31] that Mr Raman Danabal was not a qualified banksman at the time of the accident.[^32] Mr Raman Danabal only worked at the taxiway at the Workplace as a wheel loader operator on or after 26 July 2017 when he received the relevant certification.[^33]

22     The first defendant further argued in the alternative that –

> the Plaintiff (while standing on the concrete ground surface) should have held up the zinc roofing sheets to Mr Raman Danabal (who was standing on the container roof), instead of allegedly using the ladder as a “work platform”.[^34]

A further alternative argument was that the plaintiff breached “a common law duty of care towards himself”[^35] when he “failed to exercise a duty of care to ensure that the ladder was placed at a suitable angle against the container wall”.[^36]

23     The first defendant’s director, DW1, also brought to the court’s attention that the present claim was one of four in one month from 27 February 2017 to 24 March 2017, which involved his workers who all share one dormitory, and were of same ethnicity. DW1 stated in his affidavit that he had “never before encountered such a situation”[^37] in all his years of being a director. ACRA records[^38] show DW1 to have been appointed as director on 31 July 2013. The first defendant therefore questioned if the present proceedings were brought in good faith.

24     It was noteworthy that the first defendant did not impute any liability whatsoever upon the JV.

### The JV’s case

25     The JV admitted that they were the main contractors for the works at the Workplace. However, they denied that they were the occupiers of the first defendant’s “workshop area”[^39] or what the first defendant had referred to as the first defendant’s “store/office”[^40], that is, where the accident happened. This was the same area where the generators and containers were.[^41] (This area is hereinafter to be referred to as “Designated Area”.)

26     According to the JV and their witness, Mr Farhan Shah Bin Abdul Ghaffa (“DW2”), although the Designated Area was within the Workplace, it was an area “carved out from the \[Workplace\] and handed over… to the \[first defendant\] for their exclusive use, management and control”.[^42] Each of the JV’s subcontractors was allocated such an area for their site office to store their materials and tools.[^43] The Designated Area allocated to the first defendant was therefore “under the sole control and management of the \[first defendant\] at all material times”,[^44] including its “design, construction and maintenance… and how \[the first defendant\] wished to store their materials within the \[Designated Area\]”.[^45] It was further averred by the JV that the first defendant “gated and hoarded \[_sic_\] up”[^46] the Designated Area.[^47]

27     The JV further denied that the plaintiff was their “employee, servant and/or agent”[^48] or that he “was under their care and control at the material time”.[^49] According to the JV, the plaintiff was the first defendant’s “employee, agent and/or servant… and/or under the first defendant’s care and control”.[^50]

28     Regarding the accident, it was the JV’s position that they had no knowledge of the instructions that were given to the plaintiff or how the accident happened.[^51] In fact, it was the JV’s case that they did not even know about the accident until they received plaintiff’s counsel’s letter of demand dated 7 September 2017 and then inquired about this of the first defendant.

29     Not having control of the Designated Area where the accident took place, or control and management of the workers and particularly the plaintiff, and not having been apprised of the incident until they received a letter of demand, the JV argued that if the accident did happen on 14 March 2017, it “was caused wholly or contributed to by the Plaintiff’s own negligence and/or the negligence of the \[first defendant\]”.[^52]

## Issues to be determined

30     The issues which arise in this case are:

> (a)     Whether the first defendant was liable for the plaintiff’s accident and injuries as his employer;

> (b)     Whether the JV was liable for the plaintiff’s accident and injuries as the main contractor of the project and the occupier of the Workplace;

> (c)     If yes to either or both of the earlier issues, the extent of the liability or whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent.

31     In answering the issues listed, it behoves the court to make a finding on factual issues which include whether the plaintiff was required to use a ladder for the relevant task; whether the ladder was provided to him by his supervisor, as pleaded by the plaintiff; whether there was anyone atop the container to receive the zinc roofing sheet from the plaintiff; and whether the first defendant organised the toolbox meetings and undertook the risk assessments. This court shall also address the issue of the admissibility of the reports of the toolbox meetings and the risk assessments relevant here which was raised as an issue by plaintiff’s counsel.

32     It bears reminding that the burden rests upon the plaintiff to prove his case on a balance of probabilities: _Bonham-Carter v Hyde Park Hotel, Limited_ (1948) 64 TLR 177 at 178. This is regardless of whether the first defendant and/or the JV was successful in pleading their respective defences: _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 103</span>, at \[78\].

## Issue 1: Whether the first defendant was liable as the plaintiff’s employer

33     The claim against the first defendant was in the first defendant’s capacity as the plaintiff’s employer. It was the plaintiff’s case that the supervisor in the first defendant’s employment had instructed the plaintiff on his task, required him to use a ladder and provided him with the ladder.

34     The common law duty of care of an employer to his employee is clearly stated in the case of _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] SGCA 69</span>[^53] (“_Parno_’s case”) which cited with approval the case of _Wilsons & Clyde Coal Company, Limited v English_ <span class="citation">\[1938\] A.C. 57</span>[^54] and then went on to elaborate how “a proper system and effective supervision should be applied”[^55] (at \[45\]-\[46\]):

> The common law duty of employers _vis-à-vis_ their employees is clear. …\[T\]he House of Lords held that the obligation was three-fold – to provide a competent staff of men; adequate material; and a proper system and effective supervision.

> … The employer must devise a suitable system and instruct his men in what they must do: see _Pape v Cumbria County Council_ \[1992\] 3 All ER 211. In devising a safe system, the employer should be aware that workmen are often careless for their own safety, and his system must, **_as far as possible_**, reduce the effects of an employee’s own carelessness: see _General Cleaning Contractors Ltd v Christmas_ <span class="citation">\[1953\] AC 180</span> at pp1890190 per Lord Reid. The employer must also take reasonable care to ensure that his system is complied with, but he is not obliged ‘to stand over workmen of age and experience at every moment they are working… to see that they do what they are supposed to do’: see _Woods v Durable Suites Ltd_ \[1953\] 2 All ER 391 at p395C <span class="citation">\[1953\] 1 WLR 857</span> at 862 per Singleton LJ.

> (Emphasis added; see bold italics.)

35     It would not be wrong to state that with regard to _the extent_ of the duty, the common law duty is synchronised with section 12 of the WSHA[^56] when the latter states that the duty goes “so far as is reasonably practicable”.[^57] The particular portions of the WSHA which plaintiff’s counsel had specifically highlighted in her opening statement[^58] read:[^59]

> **Duties of employers**

> **12.– (1**)    It shall be the duty of every employer to take, _so far as is reasonably practicable_, such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of his employees at work.

> …..

> (3)    For the purposes of subsection (1), the measures necessary to ensure the safety and health of persons at work include –

>> (a)    providing and maintaining for those persons a work environment which is safe, without risk to health, and adequate as regards facilities and arrangements for their welfare at work;

>> (b)    ensuring that adequate safety measures are taken in respect of any machinery, equipment, plant, article or process used by those persons;

>> …..

> (Emphasis added.)

36     It was not disputed by the first defendant that it did indeed owe the plaintiff a duty of care.[^60] However, the issue is whether the first defendant breached that duty of care which resulted in the plaintiff’s accident and caused him to sustain injuries.

37     I have reviewed the oral and documentary evidence that were presented to court and am of the view that the first defendant was liable for the accident and the plaintiff’s injuries. I provide my reasons below.

### The first defendant’s case

38     It was the first defendant’s case that the plaintiff was not working alone. According to DW1, the first defendant’s witness, the supervisor, Mr Sukhjiwan Singh, had given instructions to install the zinc roofing sheets on the scaffold frame to both the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s co-worker, Mr Raman Danabal. DW1, the witness for the first defendant, was also very specific when he deposed in his affidavit how the partnership was to be carried out:[^61]

> … Mr Sukhjiwan Singh had directed the co-worker Raman Danabal, not the Plaintiff, to climb onto scaffold frame using a scaffold ladder, while the Plaintiff was instructed to remain on the ground surface, to carry and hand over the zinc roofing sheets to Raman Danabal.

39     The fact of the matter, however, was that DW1 was not present on the scene or at the Workplace when the accident happened.[^62] He was also not there when the instructions were given to the plaintiff and allegedly also to Mr Raman Danabal. When questioned on where he received these information from, DW1 replied that he received them from the project manager, one Mr Lin Kok Siong, and Mr Sukhjiwan Singh, the supervisor.[^63] However, when questioned by counsel for the JV, DW1 explained that Mr Lin Kok Siang was also not present when the accident occurred.[^64]

40     For reasons best known to itself, the first defendant did not call upon Mr Sukhjiwan Singh to depose an affidavit to clarify the very issues that are in contention. DW1 had explained that Mr Sukhjiwan Singh had left the first defendant’s employment on 26 January 2018. Notably, the first defendant’s Defence (Amendment No. 2) was filed on 2January 2018, when it was clear that the suit had commenced and would ensue.

41     Mr Raman Danabal did affirm and file an affidavit. However, he was not present during the trial to be cross-examined as he had left Singapore on 30 October 2018. On this point, the court therefore had to decide on the admissibility of his affidavit.

#### Issue of the admissibility of an affidavit where the maker was absent

42     In _Industrial & Commercial Bank Ltd v PD International Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 269</span>[^65] (“_ICB v PDI_”), the High Court in that case had also to deal with such an issue. Despite an order made under Order 38 rule 2(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322 R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) for a plaintiff’s witness who had earlier sworn an affidavit to attend the proceedings to be cross-examined, she did not present herself. The court heard that she was retrenched from the plaintiff’s service. The witness cited family commitments and refused to attend (at \[17\]). Despite that, the court admitted her affidavit on the basis that “there was nothing particularly contentious in the affidavit that had been sworn” (at \[21\]). The court also accepted that the plaintiff in that case “had also adduced satisfactory evidence to explain why they were not able to procure \[the witness’\] attendance”. Although the court recognised as valid the defendant’s counsel’s complaint that he would not be able to cross-examine the witness on matters outside her affidavit, that “was not, by itself, sufficient reason to exclude \[the plaintiff’s witness’\] affidavit which… did not contain any seriously contentious matter”.

43     Applying _ICB v PDI_ to the present case, I would have to rule Mr Raman Danabal’s affidavit inadmissible for a few reasons. First and foremost, Mr Raman Danabal’s evidence would have been crucial to the first defendant’s case. As plaintiff’s counsel suggested – and which DW1 agreed to – Mr Raman Danabal “was the only witness who could substantiate the fact that he was there as a buddy to help the Plaintiff”.[^66] His affidavit therefore contains the nub of the present issue of whether he also received the instruction to install the zinc roofing sheets on the scaffold frame. That being so, his affidavit is “particularly contentious” and contains “seriously contentious matter”. Second, I am not persuaded that the first defendant had made effort to contact Mr Raman Danabal for purposes of assisting in the present case. Whilst I accept that an employer has no “power”[^67] to retain a foreign employee who wishes to return to his home country, for the present purpose, this court would need to know that the relevant party had been intentional in its efforts to reach the deponent of the affidavit that the party wishes to rely on. The efforts of the first defendant in this case, if any, appear to me pathetic. DW1 had testified that their projects had stopped and many workers, including Mr Raman Danabal, therefore chose to leave.[^68] According to DW1, the first defendant did try to contact him. But, on his Singapore mobile number[^69] after he had sent him back to Bangladesh. Beyond that, it was apparently just a general ‘announcement’ to anyone in their office who may be listening and to the supervisor: “‘Hey, there’s a Court \[_sic_\] coming out. Please all \[_sic_\] everybody try to… liaise with him \[that is, Mr Raman Danabal\]’”.[^70]

44     My position remains firm even after a scan of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed), and, in particular, section 32, the more relevant portions of which read:[^71]

> **Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant**

> **32.– (1**)    … statements of relevant facts made by a person (whether orally, in a document or otherwise), are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:

>> **when it relates to cause of death;**

>> _(a)_ …

>> …

>> **or is made by person who is dead or who cannot be produced as witness;**

>> (_j_)    when the statement is made by a person in respect of whom it is shown –

>>> (i)    …

>>> (ii)   that despite _reasonable efforts_ to locate him, he cannot be found whether within or outside Singapore;

>>> (iii)   that he is outside Singapore and it is not practicable to secure his attendance; …

>> …

>> (Emphasis added.)

45     The case of _Cheo Yeoh & Associates LLC and another v AEL and others_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 29</span> (“_Cheo Yeoh v AEL_”) also contemplated the statutory provisions in O 38 r 2 of the ROC as well as section 32 of the Evidence Act. Even then, the Court of Appeal had reasons to support their admitting the affidavits of the four missing respondents who were outside Singapore. They held that “it was not practical to secure their attendance” and the reasons were such as (at \[95\]) –

> (a)    \[two\] respondents were taking care of their children in Jakarta which was then badly affected by flood;

> (b)    \[one\] respondent was unable to obtain a passport extension to come to Singapore as the floods in Jakarta had cut off the electricity to the immigration office; and

> (c)    \[another\] respondent was unable to take time off her studies in the USA to travel to Singapore for the trial.

The Court of Appeal also recognised that (in \[97\]) “the Respondents’ claims all arose from the same set of facts. There was nothing extra that the Absent Respondents need to prove in order to succeed.” Their affidavits were in fact also part of a joint affidavit which was admitted.

46     Returning to our case at hand, the first defendant had nothing to show the court that “reasonable efforts” were made to contact Mr Raman Danabal, or even that he had continued to remain “outside Singapore and it \[was\] not practicable to secure his attendance”. In view of that, just as the trial judge did in _Cheo Yeoh v AEL_, so I should exercise my discretion under section 32(3) of the Evidence Act, except that I have found it necessary to hold that Mr Raman Danabal’s affidavit and the facts deposed therein are highly relevant, and even contentious. Mr Raman Danabal’s presence in the present proceedings should therefore have been procured. His being absent therefrom was therefore damaging, even fatal, to the first defendant’s case in that the first defendant really has nothing now to support its case.

### The plaintiff’s case

47     Of course, regardless of how weak the first defendant’s defence is, the onus to prove his case always remained with the plaintiff, that is even if a weak defence is capable of tilting the balance and turn a plaintiff’s possibility into a probability. The plaintiff thus bore a burden of proof on a balance of probabilities which he still needed to discharge.

48     In this regard, having heard the plaintiff on his evidence, I am inclined to believe the plaintiff to be telling the truth when he testified that he was working alone at the material time. The plaintiff was consistent throughout his cross-examinations by first defendant’s counsel and the counsel for the JV that he was working alone.[^72] What was prominent to me, was the clarity and specificity by which the plaintiff shared how he carried out his task. From his responses to counsel for the first defendant and counsel to the JV, on how he carried out his task, this court had no reason to doubt his testimony but be persuaded that he was indeed working alone. This is regardless of whom Mr Sukhjiwan Singh issued his instructions to as it would also be incumbent upon the first defendant to ensure that its instructions were carried out in effect.

49     It is not disputed that just before the accident, the plaintiff had successfully installed three zinc roofing sheets above the generator which was beside the container. It was when he was installing the fourth zinc roofing sheet on the scaffold platform above the container that the accident happened.

50     When first defendant’s counsel asked the plaintiff how he managed to successfully install the three zinc roofing sheets above the generator set before the accident, the plaintiff described his process:[^73]

> … by pla---pla---positioning the sheet against the---so, placing the sheet against the container then, climbing up the ladder then, taking up the sheet, placing it onto my head then, I pushed---I put it above the---I put it above the roof.

When his method was challenged and it was suggested to him by first defendant’s counsel that he only needed “to climb up the ladder and there was no need… to hold onto the zinc roofing sheets at the same time while ascending the ladder”,[^74] the plaintiff responded with, “But it will fall backwards, the sheet. Then if it falls backwards where would I go?”[^75]

51     When the plaintiff was asked more specifically whether he had placed the ladder beneath the zinc roofing sheets which were leaning against the container, the plaintiff explained that the ladder was already there and he had put the zinc roofing sheets over the ladder instead. He then agreed with first defendant’s counsel that he “\[went\] beneath the zinc sheets, stood down and… what \[he\] did then was to try to climb up the ladder and at the same time, balance the \[30kg\] zinc sheet above \[his\] head”.[^76] In all fairness to the plaintiff, he did not agree with first defendant’s counsel that the zinc sheets were heavy when he was asked.[^77] He instead opined that, “It’s not that heavy but it’s very long, lengthwise.”[^78]

52     During cross-examination by JV’s counsel, the plaintiff provided even more clarity when he was asked the same, as to exactly how he carried the zinc roofing sheets and installed them successfully on the scaffold platform above the generator:

> Q:    So I would like to clarify, how did you try to lift up the zinc sheet?

> A:    So as I was standing out there, and then I tried to lift it with both my hands. And then, the ladder slipped through me---under me.

> Q:    Okay. Can you clarify? Because earlier you also said that you had held the ladder with one hand, remember?

> A:    Yes. So when I climb \[_sic_\] the 2 steps, I held with my one hand. So when I was going to climb the 3rd and 4th steps, so then, I tried to lift it up using my both hands. And then, that’s when the ladder slipped from under me.

> Q:    Can you clarify when you try \[_sic_\] to lift up the zinc sheet with both your hands, because earlier you also said you used your head? So we want to know how---how you had actually carry \[_sic_\] the zinc sheet with your head also and your 2 hands. Yes, you can stand up and show.

> A:    So, when from---below the steps, so when I’m at the 2nd or the 3rd step of the ladder. So, from ground dow---ground up, so I’m carrying it with one hand, my left hand is on the ladder and my right hand is holding the zinc sheets. Placed on to my head, so when I---so when I reached up to that 3rd and 4th level, when I wanted to push it upwards, that’s when the ladder slipped.

53     However, the plaintiff agreed with first defendant’s counsel that nobody told him to lift the zinc sheets up in that manner. The plaintiff admitted that that was his own method, but retorted that he did what he did “because there was nobody else to give me a hand”.[^79] There was no evidence before me of what method exactly Mr Sukhjiwan Singh or the first defendant had instructed the plaintiff to use. The plaintiff only deposed in his affidavit in very general terms that, “My supervisor had provided me with a ladder to carry out the task.”[^80] However, the plaintiff subsequently did admit during cross-examination that the ladder “was already there”.[^81]

54     In the main, there is nothing in the plaintiff’s testimony that gives me reason to doubt that he was indeed working alone at the material time. He knew what he was doing and he was able to describe it the way he did it. Providing the plaintiff with a co-worker certainly would not be too much to ask of an employer for such a task as the one the plaintiff was assigned to. In fact, from his expressions and disbelief, the first defendant’s counsel himself considered that it was a near-Herculean task to lift a 30kg 5m zinc sheet. The first defendant should therefore have ensured that there were at least two workers on the job, and not just instruct and then leave the workers to their own devises, if it had indeed assigned two workers to the job. I would consider that as being within the boundary of what is reasonable expected of an employer in _Parno_’s case and is “reasonably practicable” as _per_ section 12(1) of the WSHA.

55     If the first defendant insist that they did provide a system where two workers work on the task, my finding nevertheless remained that even _if_ that were so, when the accident occurred on 14 March 2017, the plaintiff was working alone. The first defendant as employer would then have failed to “take reasonable care to ensure that \[its\] system \[was\] complied with”: _Parno_’s case, at \[46\]. But of course this was not the plaintiff’s pleaded case.

56     There was also the testimony of PW2, who testified to Mr Raman Danabal working with him at another area of the Workplace and so, would not be in the vicinity of the Designated Area. However, I was unable to rely on PW2’s testimony. To begin with, PW2 was not even clear about the period when Mr Raman Danabal was allegedly his banksman and whether that was the period of the accident. Although DW1 filed a supplementary affidavit[^82] to show that at the time of the accident, Mr Raman Danabal was not yet certified to be a banksman, but the court could not be certain that that would prevent Mr Raman Danabal from still helping out as a banksman. I had therefore not relied on DW1’s supplementary affidavit also for this reason.

57     Going back to PW2’s affidavit, his reference to dates was vague, such as “\[a\]t the end of one working day in early 2017…”.[^83] He had maintained this when he was cross-examined by JV’s counsel on the same and he had said, “Yah, I cannot remember the date”,[^84] and after that he again agreed with JV’s counsel when the latter suggested, “… the Court cannot be sure at all that the day that you are referring to in the first 10 words \[of paragraph 4 of your affidavit\] is 14th of March 2017”.[^85] All in all, I regret to say that I had not found PW2’s testimony helpful for our purposes.

### Summary and conclusion

58     To summarise my findings on this issue, I had found the plaintiff to have proven his case on a balance of probabilities that he was working alone on that fateful day when he suffered the injuries. On the other side of the same coin, the first defendant had failed to persuade the court that Mr Raman Danabal was working with the plaintiff at the Designated Area, to receive from the plaintiff, standing at ground level, the zinc roofing sheets therefrom and onto the scaffold platform. The task clearly called for a system where it would be reasonable and reasonably practicable of the employer to have provided two workers for the job. However, there is no evidence before me that Mr Sukhjiwan Singh did instruct two workers to install the zinc sheets. If he had, my finding was that the plaintiff was working alone at the task on 14 March 2017 and the first defendant had therefore failed to ensure that two workers were at that job. There was also no evidence before me that the first defendant gave instruction or adequate instruction on how the job was to be done.

59     On these counts, the first defendant had failed to ensure that two workers were installing the zinc sheets. The first defendant was therefore derelict in its duty of care to the plaintiff to ensure his safety. They had breached this duty owed to the plaintiff to provide a safe system. I therefore find the first defendant liable for the plaintiff’s injuries, loss and damage..

## Issue 2: Whether the JV was liable as the main contractor and occupier of the Workplace

### JV – the main contractor

60     It was not in dispute that the JV was the main contractor and occupier of the Workplace. With regard to the duty of care that a main contractor owes a worker, the case of _Neo Siong Chew v Cheng Guan Seng and others_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 93</span>[^86] (“_Neo Siong Chew_’s case”) (at \[37\]) is instructive:

> It is established that that a main contractor owes a workman a duty of care even if the workman was not employed by him but by a subcontractor if the main contractor exercised or had the right to exercise control over the workman in respect of the work which he was engaged to perform (_Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 746</span> at \[20\]; and _Ma HongFei v U-Hin Manufacturing Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 336</span> at \[48\]-\[49\]).

61     As the main contractor of the project, the JV, their employees or agents, could not be totally hands-off, and would need to have some control of their subcontractors and so, the subcontractors’ workers. It was therefore correct of DW2 when he agreed with plaintiff’s counsel that the JV needed to be informed when they were “going to go on the runway”,[^87] or when the compacting of the soil was not done properly.[^88] DW2 opined that “\[i\]t doesn’t mean they are subcontractor there, they totally ignore the joint venture supervisors and safety personnel”.[^89] The subcontractor workers would also “come under the\[  \] control \[of the JV\]”. Rightly so. As such, if, in carrying out the task for the main contractor’s project the subcontractor’s employee gets injured, that would be a situation where the main contractor should be held accountable for. However, the present case is not such a case.

62     It is clear what task the plaintiff was doing when he got injured. The first defendant had just been allocated the Designated Area within the Workplace to use “as a site office and storage of \[its\] materials, tools and equipment”.[^90] The plaintiff was therefore tasked to install the zinc roofing sheets as part of setting up the first defendant’s work area.[^91] It was up to the first defendant how the Designated Area should be designed, constructed, organised or maintained. Even if the risk assessment forms and method statement needed to first be submitted to the JV, it would be reasonable to consider that thereafter, the first defendant would be answerable for what happens in its own Designated Area. In fact, the risk assessment forms and method statement would have shown the first defendant to be well aware of the risks involved and to have identified them and how to tackle and manage the risk points and areas. It is to be noted that the plaintiff did not take issue with any deficiencies in the risk assessment forms and the method statements. That is to say, whatever risks there would be, the first defendanthad properly identified and put on paper how they could be managed.

63     The plaintiff therefore raised the issue of the lack of evidence showing that the JV did review the risk assessments and the method statements put up by the first defendant. Plaintiff’s counsel in fact put it to the JV’s witness, DW2, that as the cover page of the risk assessment forms were missing, so, there was nothing to show that the JV reviewed the documents. Since there was nothing to show that the JV reviewed the documents, this meant that they did not review or approve them.[^92] I have to admit that at first blush, that appeared to be logical. However, in reviewing the evidence, it cannot be ignored that although DW2 had admitted that he could not remember whether the particular risk assessment forms shown to him were reviewed by the JV,[^93] he was clear that works at the Workplace could not have been allowed to carry on if the risk assessments and method statement had not been reviewed:

> any works prior to… being carried out physically, … the Method Statement and the Risk Assessment has \[_sic_\] to be reviewed by the joint venture and… approved by us \[the JV\] and this information shall then be given to our client, … for their information. So, … _in any circumstances, there… cannot be\[ \] a work that …, any form of work to be carried out without the Method Statement and the Risk Assessment being… reviewed by the joint venture_.[^94]

> …

> I mentioned earlier, … we have to… clear and review this, … Risk Assessment.[^95]

> \[Emphasis added\]

When it was put to him, DW2 was unequivocal in his response that he disagreed with plaintiff’s counsel that the JV had failed to review or approve the risk assessments.[^96]

64     With the generator on site, as well as the container, that the plaintiff was installing the zinc roof sheets, the presence of the first defendant, and the testimony of PW2 that he was operating an excavator, on a balance of probabilities, I am inclined to accept that the risk assessment forms and method statement were submitted and reviewed and likely even submitted to the owner of the Workplace, before the accident happened.

65     Even if I was mistaken in my finding above that the JV did review and approve the risk assessment forms and method statements, it cannot be that as the main contractor, the JV was to be liable for any- and everything that happened at the Workplace. To make the JV responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries while he was setting up the first defendant’s work area would be like making a landlord, who has rented out one of his unfurnished rooms, liable for his tenant’s injuries when the tenant hammers his thumb while putting a nail into his Do-It-Yourself furniture. I would therefore venture to opine that the test of whether a main contractor should be made liable for a worker’s injury is therefore not just whether the main contractors have management and control over the particular worker, but whether the main contractors have management and control over the particular worker _in respect of the work which the worker was performing when he got injured._ See: _Awang bin Dollah v Shun Shing Construction & Engineering Co Ltd and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 746</span> at \[20\]; and _Ma HongFei v U-Hin Manufacturing Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 SLR(R) 336</span> at \[48\]-\[49\]), cited in _Neo Siong Chew_’s case.

66     For the plaintiff’s injuries sustained while he was installing the zinc roofing sheets in the Designated Area therefore, it is my finding that for that particular occasion, the JV “did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff because it did not exercise nor had the right to exercise control over the plaintiff”, to use the words of Lai Siu Chiu J in _Neo Siong Chew_’s case (at \[38\]). The plaintiff’s claims against the JV for negligence as a main contractor therefore fails.

### JV – the occupier

67     In suing the JV in their capacity as the occupier, the plaintiff’s basis was that the JV was the occupier of the Workplace. By “Workplace”, the plaintiff also included the Designated Area as that was within the Workplace. Whilst I do accept this argument, I would not go so far as to agree with plaintiff’s counsel that the duty of care owed by an occupier to the workmen would be the same in the Workplace which is not the Designated Area, and in the Designated Area.

68     The plaintiff’s complaints against the JV in their capacity as occupier as pleaded were their “failing to take any or any reasonable care to remedy any unsafe work systems or practices at the \[Workplace\] of which they knew or ought to know…”.[^97] These included –

> (a)     Their failure to “to perform a Risk Assessment, provide safe standards and practices and to conduct regular Tool Box Meetings to brief employees and subcontractors on \[workplace safety and health\] matters”[^98] in accordance with _Workplace Safety and Health Guidelines (Contractor Management)_[^99] (a publication of Workplace Safety and Health Council in collaboration with the Ministry of Manpower, September 2011); and

> (b)     Their breach of duty under section 11 of the WSHA.

69     The plaintiff also made reference to the JV’s “**failure to approve** the \[m\]ethod \[s\]tatement and the \[r\]isk \[a\]ssessment in using ladders to build the structure...” \[emphases in original\].

70     With regard to the reviewing and approving of the risk assessment forms and the method statement, I maintain my earlier finding that the same were prepared and approved. The risk areas were therefore properly and adequately identified as there was no evidence of any particulars in the reports or statement which were in issue. The issue was with the actual risk management or carrying out of the task in accordance with the prescription in the risk assessment forms.

71     On the tool box meetings, the plaintiff took issue with the admissibility of the Daily Toolbox Meeting Reports[^100] (“Toolbox Reports”) as the makers of the documents were not called as witnesses.[^101] The Toolbox Reports were introduced as exhibits by DW1. As a director of the first defendant, these would be official records that DW1, as director, could be said to “own” and to answer for. I therefore consider them to be admissible by virtue of section 32(1)b)(iv) which reads:

> **Cases in which statement of relevant fact by person who is dead or cannot be found, etc., is relevant**

> **32.– (1**)    … statements of relevant facts made by a person (whether orally, in a document or otherwise), are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:

>> **when it relates to cause of death;**

>> (_a_)    …

>> …

>> **or is made in course of trade, business, profession or other occupation;**

>> (_b_)    when the statement was made by a person in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or other occupation and in particular when it consists of –

>>> …

>>> (iv)   a document constituting, or forming part of, the records (whether past or present) of a trade, business, profession or other occupation that are recorded, owned or kept by any person, body or organisation carrying out the trade, business, or other profession, and includes a statement made in a document that is, or forms part of, a record compiled by a person acting in the ordinary course of a trade, business, profession or other occupation, based on information supplied by other persons;

>>> …

72     It is clear from the Toolbox Reports, that the plaintiff attended the toolbox meetings and so, would have been properly apprised of the risk factors and how the risks should be managed. Particularly, the plaintiff attended the toolbox meeting of 14 March 2017 – the day of the accident.

73     On section 11 of the WSHA, this provision stipulates that the duty of an occupier is to “every person within those premises”[^102] :

> **Duty of occupier of workplace**

> **11**.    It shall be the duty of every occupier of any workplace to take, so far as is reasonably practicable, such measures to ensure that –

>> (a)    the workplace;

>> (b)    all means of access to or egress from the workplace; and

>> (c)    …

> are safe and without risks to health to every person within those premises, whether or not the person is at work or is an employee of the occupier.    

74     However, Lai Siu Chiu J in _Neo Siong Chew_’s case (at \[44\]-\[48\]) raised the issue of whether a breach of the statutory provisions confers a right on an individual to raise a private right of action for breach of the duty. She arrived at the conclusion that it does not. She then went on to discuss an occupier’s liability.

75     As JV’s counsel correctly pointed out, the law on occupiers’ liability has been subsumed into the tort of negligence by the landmark case of _See Toh Siew Kee v Ho Ah Lam Ferrocement (Pte) Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 284</span> (“_See Toh_’s case”). _See Toh_’s case then applied the principles of negligence in _Spandeck Engineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 229</span> (“_Spandeck_’s case).

76      _See Toh_’s case, applying the test set out in _Spandeck_’s case stipulates that three elements that must established before a duty of care can be imposed on a defendant (at \[53\]): (a) factual foreseeability; (b) sufficient legal proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant; and (c) “the absence of policy considerations that ought to negate a duty of care”.

77     Applying this to our present case, it appears to me that there would be an issue with “factual foreseeability”. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in _See Toh_’s case (at \[53\]), this is an element which must be established for the claim to launch.

78     There is “factual foreseeability” if it were foreseeable that an invitee such as the plaintiff would suffer damage if occupiers do not remove danger. I do not think that the burden should be so onerous as to remove _all_ danger; I would therefore boldly borrow the words of section 11 of the WSHA, that the danger should be removed “so far as is reasonably practicable”. This would align with the standards in the statutory provisions of sections 11 and 12 of the WSHA.

79     Noting that the decision in _See Toh_’s case was released on 24 April 2013, and _Neo Siong Chew_’s case on 30 April 2013, in going on to discuss occupier’s liability in the latter case, one wonders if the learned Lai Siu Chiu J might have _See Toh_’s case at the back of her mind when she, in effect, made a finding on “factual foreseeability”. In _Neo Siong Chew_’s case, in deciding on the issue of occupier’s liability, Lai Siu Chiu J said (at \[49\]):

> An occupier owes a duty of care to prevent injury to an invitee from unusual dangers which the occupier knows or ought to have known about (_Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 223</span> at \[47\] (“_Sapri_”). Cruticially, this duty only pertains to the physical condition of the premises and not the operations at the site (_Sapri_ at \[47\]).

Applying that to the facts of the case, the learned Judge ruled (at \[50\]) that the accident in that case “arose out of the operations at the Site.” A distinction was clearly then made between the physical condition of the premises and the operation that went on at the Site.

80     In view of the directive in _Spandeck_’s case to use negligence principles even for an occupier’s duty of care, and observing how it was wielded in both _Spandeck_’s case and _Neo Siong Chew_’s case, a distinction ought to also be made in the present case. If there was inherent danger lurking in the Workplace which would be incumbent upon the JV to eliminate, but it was not, and that caused the plaintiff his injuries, the JV should be made liable. However, it was clear that in the present case, the plaintiff’s accident was as a result of ‘an operation’ and not a condition of the premises.

81     On this ground and the grounds earlier mentioned, the inevitable finding is that the JV is also not liable to the plaintiff for his injuries as an occupier.

### Summary and conclusion

82     Although the JV owed the plaintiff a duty of care as main contractor to a workman, for the task that the plaintiff was performing when he had the accident, it was not one that the JV had issued instructions to the plaintiff. It was also not one where the JV would have control over, as the instructions were managed by the plaintiff’s own employer.

83     There were also risk assessment forms and method statement which detailed the operation and there was no evidence that they were deficient in their listing of the risky operations and how these should be managed. Although there was no evidence that could allow the court to rule conclusively that the JV had reviewed and approved it, this court took into account that operations had already started. From DW2’s evidence, it would appear that the risk assessment forms and method statement were in order.

84     Further, given the area that the accident happened in, although the JV had general jurisdiction over the Workplace, their jurisdiction over the Designated Area was limited to some extent. The first defendant was really the ones in control of the operations and the goings-on in the Designated Area. In the present case, the JV did not even know about the accident – and this was not due to any neglect or such on their part – until plaintiff’s counsel’s letter reached them concerning the present suit.

85     So, whilst the plaintiff had pleaded that the JV had the duty to remedy any unsafe work systems or practices, these would have been disclosed in the risk assessment forms and the method statement. It would be going beyond “as far as is practicable” if the JV had to micro-manage the first defendant’s employees’ operations or eyeball that the risk management systems detailed is to be followed. I am not satisfied that they breached the standard expected of them.

86     Even as occupier of the Workplace, for how the accident occurred, it was not a consequence of the condition of the Workplace, but was as a result of the operations that were happening. Even if it had happened in the Workplace – only because the Designated Area is within the Workplace – the JV was circumscribed in its control and management in the Designated Area. They therefore could not be expected to have the same extent of control and level of duty of care as they would have over the general area of the Workplace.

87     All considered, the plaintiff’s claim against the JV is dismissed. I reiterate my observation that the first defendant had not imputed or suggested any liability upon the JV.

## Issue 3: Whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent

88     It was the plaintiff’s case that he was working alone when he installed the zinc roofing sheets, that his supervisor, Mr Sukhjiwan Singh required him to use a ladder and provided him the ladder from which he fell and injured himself.

89     As earlier mentioned, Mr Sukhjiwan Singh was not called as a witness for either the first defendant or the plaintiff. We therefore only have the plaintiff’s bare assertions that Mr Sukhjiwan Singh required him to use a ladder, as well as was the one who provided him the ladder. With nothing more, on a balance of probabilities, I am not persuaded that that was what happened.

90     The plaintiff had used a ladder to carry out his job, and fell. When cross-examined and posed with an alternative method of getting the zinc roofing sheet up to the scaffold platform such as by “climb\[ing\] on to the container and… \[then\] pull\[ing\] up the very long zinc roofing sheet on to the container”,[^103] the plaintiff had replied, “Nobody told me to. If they had told me to then, I would”.[^104] He reiterated that when he was re-asked the same,[^105] but agreed that the method suggested by first defendant’s counsel would indeed be “more systematic”.[^106]

91     As the cross-examination by first defendant’s counsel wore on, the evidence came forth that the ladder was already in a particular position, and it was the plaintiff who placed the zinc roofing sheet over the ladder, then “proceeded to go beneath the zinc sheet, stood down, and… what \[he\] then did was to try to climb up the ladder and at the same time, balance the zinc sheet above \[his\] head.[^107] I reiterate that the plaintiff had confirmed that the zinc sheet was 30kg[^108] and when asked whether a zinc sheet was heavy, he had opined that it was “not that heavy”.[^109] It was also revealed that in actual fact, no one had told him to carry the zinc sheet that way:[^110]

> Q:    … Where did you place the ladder? Did you place the ladder beneath the zinc roofing sheets?

> A:    The---the ladder was already there below the zinc sheet.

> Q:    Okay. And so, you had proceeded to place the zinc sheet at where the ladder was?

> A:    Yes.

> Q:    And you proceeded to go beneath the zinc sheet, stood down and can you confirm that what you then did was to try to climb up the ladder and at the same time, balance the zinc sheet above your head?

> A:    Yes. That’s how I carried it and that’s how it slipped.

> …

> Q:    But, Mr. Gursahib, I’m putting to you that no one from the company instructed you to work in that manner. Agree or disagree?

> A:    I don’t agree.

> Q:     _So_, who gave you---_who from the company gave you the instruction to work in that manner?_

> A:     _No, nobody told me that._

> …

> Q:    But I’m---I’m putting to you---I’m putting to you, Mr. Gursahib, _no one from the company told you to lift up the zinc roofing sheets in that manner._

> A:     _Yes, nobody told me that this is the way to ca---to carry this._

> Q:    Okay. So, I’m putting to you that _it was you who solely decided to work in that manner._

> A:     _Yes, it was my thinking._

> \[Emphasis added.\]

92     The plaintiff further agreed with first defendant’s counsel that no one made the decision for him as to how he should move the zinc roofing sheets to be installed. However, the plaintiff also retorted, “Yes, yes, I only had made the decision because there was no one nobody else to give me a hand.”[^111]

93     The plaintiff also recounted to the court how he ascended the ladder before the ladder “slipped”[^112]: “I have one hand on the ladder, so when the ladder was leaning against the container, so the ladder slipped and then I fell.”[^113] He then also agreed with first defendant’s counsel that he “would not have fallen… if \[he was\] using both hands to hold onto the ladder”.[^114]

94     The plaintiff, however, also took issue with the ladder that he used that day:[^115]

> “The ladder had a very small footholds, yah, as per the photograph. Pointing to page 194 of the red binder. The… ladder---the legs of the ladders were very narrow---small. The footprint is small and at the top of the ladder there was \[_sic_\] no hooks such that it will hook onto the container.”

It was clarified that the plaintiff was referring to the photograph at the Bundle of Affidavits of Evidence-In-Chief at page 194[^116] and to the feet of the ladder and not the rungs of the ladder.[^117]

95     However, when the plaintiff was cross-examined by JV’s counsel on how he managed to put up the earlier three zinc roofing sheets prior to the accident, the plaintiff testified that there were no problems with the ladder.[^118] He was also working alone when he installed the earlier three zinc roofing sheets prior to the accident, and it was the same ladder that he had used.[^119] What was different, so the plaintiff explained, was that over the generator when he was installing the first three zinc sheets, “there was a proper frame made”.[^120]

96     As for the issue with the hooks, when first defendant’s counsel confronted him with the picture which showed the ladder to have hooks at the top, it seemed that the plaintiff changed his story and had to keep layering it. First, the plaintiff had taken issue with the ladder not having hooks. When that was shown to him, he said that there were no pipes for him to hook the ladder onto. When that was shown to him, he said that they were recessed and he was unable to hook the ladder onto them:[^121]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Now, Mr. Gursahib, at page 194 BF194, you have a photograph, can you not see that the ladder has---had hooks at the top?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, there are hooks above.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So, what you just told this Court earlier that there were no hooks, that is not true, isn’t it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

What I mean is that, there was no place for---for me to have the ladder hook onto. There was no place for me to have the ladder hook onto.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

But you earlier just told this Court that the zinc roofing sheets will be placed above scaffold, yes?

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, should be above but---

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A:

 | 

But the scaffolding did not have any pipe such that I can hook the ladder onto.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Pointing at the image. It was recessed far back so---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

What was recessed?

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

He says that the, “This piping was recessed backwards”. So---

 |

  
  

97     In the plaintiff’ Statement of Claim,[^122] it seems that the plaintiff alleged negligence on all the defendants’ parts for not ensuring that the ladder was securely fixed or lashed.[^123] However, I had found it odd with the plaintiff’s explanation, particularly since it was not disputed that the picture on page 194 of the Bundle of Affidavits was taken after the accident.[^124] On page 193 of the same bundle, the plaintiff had even circled structures in the picture which were not yet present when the accident happened, as far as this court was concerned, the alleged recessed pipe was one of the structures which were not present at that time. It was therefore baffling to me why the plaintiff would go to such lengths and morph his story as he went along, unless of course the facts are not what he was telling the court?

98     Putting that aside, the plaintiff also informed the court, through JV’s counsel’s cross-examination, that besides hooking the ladder on to the frame, he would “double check that the ladder was fairly stable before climbing it.”[^125] So it was when he was doing his fourth piece of zinc roofing sheet, as an experienced construction worker, he had checked and ensure that the ladder was stable.[^126] He further confirmed that the ladder was stable when he was on it on the first two rungs. He then said, “when I reach \[_sic_\] the 3rd and the 4th step when I was trying to move the zinc sheet up, to push it up, that’s when it became unstable”;[^127] “\[y\]es, it wobbled then only.”[^128] However, despite what he deposed in his affidavit,[^129] and even in court, he quickly corrected himself and said:[^130]

> No, I don’t mean it wobbled, I mean, it slipped immediately it \[_sic_\] just when I carried---so, when I was lifting the---the---when I was lifting the zinc sheet and then immediately the---the ladder just slipped from under me. It didn’t shake or anything, it just slipped from under me.

However, he later re-corrected and said that, “So, I am saying what I said earlier, I maintain that, that as it slipped it also wobbled or shake \[_sic_\]---shake a little bit, yah.”[^131]

99     As the only person who could explain what actually happened and why it happened, when asked, why he thought the ladder slipped,[^132] all the plaintiff could say was, “I would not know because I was trying to straighten the zinc sheet”.[^133]

100    Quite clearly, from the evidence, regardless of what the first defendant’s instructions to the plaintiff were, or to how many workers, the plaintiff was a lone worker when he was installing the zinc roofing sheets. He still needed to get the job done. Since there was no co-worker who could assist to hoist up the zinc sheet from when he lifts it from the ground, the plaintiff had to make his way up a ladder in order to be able to do that. Even the alternative method suggested by the first defendantrequired the plaintiff to climb up to the container using a ladder.

101    However, I take issue with the way the plaintiff chose to do that. In his evidence when cross-examined by first Defendant’s counsel, he had said that he placed the zinc sheet over a ladder and proceeded to climb the ladder. At some point, he would lift up the zinc sheet, place it on his head and then pushed the sheet forward onto the scaffold frame. When he was re-examined by his counsel, he had said that it was at about the third and fourth rung where he would lift up the zinc sheet with both hands, and that was when the accident happened.[^134] However, the plaintiff did agree with first defendant’s counsel that a better way might have been if the plaintiff had climbed up onto the container or generator first without carrying any zinc sheet. (Presumably, this was _if_ the plaintiff had to use a ladder, since it is the first defendant’s case that there were two workers and so, there was no need to use a ladder.) Given the length of the zinc sheet which extended way over the container, it would have been a safer alternative method of working. Quite clearly, the plaintiff did not explore or contemplate this method or any other method at all.

102    At the time of the accident, although the plaintiff had only been with the first defendant company for a few months,[^135] he had been in the construction industry since December 2009.[^136] However, the plaintiff had denied that he had ever heard of the term “3-point contact”.[^137] Even if the plaintiff was not familiar with the terminology, it would be reasonable to consider him as having been ‘trained’ in the use of ladders. Also, DW1 had testified that a worker such as the plaintiff would have undergone the Construction Safety Orientation Course (“CSOC”). This Court takes judicial notice that included in the CSOC syllabus is the segment on working at height and the use of ladders and step platforms. Even if the plaintiff was an inattentive student during the CSOC, I consider it blatant that the plaintiff should deny that he had been trained in these areas. Further, the plaintiff was also present at the toolbox meetings and specifically, at the toolbox meeting of 14 March 2017, according to the day’s Toolbox Report, the use of “buddy system when using ladder”[^138] was an area which was specifically briefed. (I had earlier determined that the Toolbox Reports were admissible.)

103    Equipped with the knowledge and trained with the experience, it would be reasonable to expect the plaintiff to employ safe methods and to exercise some sensibilities as he performed his task. If he had to use the ladder, it would be reasonable to expect the plaintiff to be aware of the risks and how he should manage and avert the risks. Instead, when asked pointedly whether he considered it risky when he climbed the ladder and held the zinc sheets, his replies revealed that safety did not even feature in his mind. His responses included, “at that point I didn’t give it much thought”;[^139] “I didn’t know… I would fall”[^140]; “…at that point it didn't seem risky to me”;[^141] “I didn't give it much thought, I didn't know that it was risky that I would fall”;[^142] and “I didn't give it much thought that it would be risky. If I had known then that it was risky, I wouldn't have climbed up the ladder.”[^143] Why would it not be risky to climb a ladder carrying 30kg which is not a compact object, but a 5m sheet? The plaintiff provided no explanation for that.

104    Further, the plaintiff very well knew that the ladder was not secured, lashed or hooked. There was also no other co-worker on the ground to assist by holding the ladder. Again, we bear in mind that it was not the first defendant’s case that the plaintiff should be required to use a ladder given that the zinc sheet was more than double the height of the container. However, there was also no co-worker atop the container to receive from the plaintiff the zinc sheet. The plaintiff claimed to have requested of Mr Sukhjiwan Singh for another worker to help him. However, once again, there was no mention of this anywhere until he was cross-examined by the first defendant’s counsel.[^144] Of course, it also remained a bare assertion with nothing to corroborate it. Despite all these, the plaintiff chose to carry out his task the way he did, throwing caution to the wind, and was prepared to ride the risks in order to just “get\[ \] on with \[the\] job”.[^145] It would take very little for anyone looking at the plaintiff perform his job the way he did – by carrying a load of 30kg up a ladder – to recognise the risks and that the plaintiff was taking a risk. I therefore consider that the plaintiff was not acting as a reasonably prudent man. His conduct contributed to the accident.

105    Whilst I had held the first defendant liable for their not providing the plaintiff with a co-worker, I take issue with the way the plaintiff had consciously chosen to carry out his task under the circumstance. The plaintiff cannot decide to be careless about his own safety and expect someone else to compensate him totally for it. I reiterate that I find the plaintiff to have contributed to his own injuries as “he ought reasonably to have foreseen that if he did not act as a reasonable prudent man, he might hurt himself”: _Froom v Butcher_ <span class="citation">\[1976\] QB 286</span> at 291, followed by the Court of Appeal case of _Parno v SC Marine Pte Ltd_ \[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 579[^146] (at \[59\]) (“_Parno_’s case).

### Apportionment of liabilities

106     _Parno_’s case was also instructive in the considerations that could be taken into account in apportioning liability. While recognising that every case has to be decided on its own facts, there are some guiding principles. These include (at \[64\]) whether the employee’s actions were “taken in the heat of the moment following an emergency created by the employer’s carelessness”; whether the risk “was one which a reasonably prudent man in the plaintiff’s position would take”; and whether it was “a mere error of judgment”.

107    In _Parno_’s case, the worker was assigned to watch over a piling tower deck onboard a dumb barge. He noticed a loose pin. If the loose pin fell off, there was a risk that another pin would follow, the consequence of which was that there would be a grave risk to the entire piling operation. So, upon noticing this, the worker attempted to rectify this by temporarily replacing the pin with a small wire usually used for welding. In doing so, the worker was injured very badly. The Court of Appeal in _Parno_’s case took into account that the defendant-company failed to provide proper system and effective supervision, including faulty co-ordination between the worker and persons in the control room, and inadequate instructions to and supervision of the worker and even inadequate inspection and maintenance of the piling machinery. It also considered that the worker’s act was, “\[a\]t most, … a momentary lapse on the \[worker’s\] part” (at \[66\]); the incident happening at 5pm when the worker had been working since 6am; the worker was inexperienced in that he had never worked on a piling barge before; that he was a conscientious worker who was anxious to replace the loose pin “as he was concerned for the safety of the entire piling operation” (at \[68\]) and so overlooked the safety aspect, but the court considered that the worker was not imprudent in doing what he did. Taking all these into consideration, the Court of Appeal apportioned responsibility of the worker’s injuries to one-third and two-thirds to the employer.

108    In the present case, for the first defendant’s breach of not providing the plaintiff with a co-worker or not ensuring that, it had failed to provide a proper system of work and effective supervision. This failure triggered the plaintiff to devise his own ‘system’ to get the job done. However, in contrast to the worker in _Parno_’s case, I considered the plaintiff here to have been imprudent in disregarding his own safety. There was no evidence that the work was urgent or that there was time pressure. After all, according to the plaintiff, he had also requested his supervisor, Mr Sukhjiwan Singh, for another worker and Mr Sukhjiwan Singh “said that he will arrange”.[^147] Could not the plaintiff have waited? Also, unlike in _Parno_’s case where the accident happened at almost the end of the day when the worker was probably tired, work on 14 March 2017 had just started with the toolbox meeting at 8am and the accident happened just slightly more than an hour later, at 9.15am. On top of that, the plaintiff here has had around 8 years’ experience in construction work compared with the worker in _Parno_’s case who had no prior experience at the job and was only one and a half weeks into the job. So, for the injuries apportioned at one-third to the worker in _Parno_’s case, the extent of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence should not be lower.

## Conclusion

109    I had earlier found the first defendant to be liable in negligence to the plaintiff. It is also my finding that the first defendant was the more culpable for causing the plaintiff to be in a state where he had to devise his own method to get the job done. However, if a worker is in that position, I consider that he should still take ownership of his own safety. That is the very reason why the CSOC is a mandatory course for construction workers.

110    Despite the first defendant’s breach, the plaintiff chose an improper and unsafe method to perform his task. For his imprudence, I therefore found him to be contributorily negligent. I take into account, amongst other factors earlier mentioned, the plaintiff’s ample training and experience and so, the lesser duty of care that would be expected of the first defendant in the present case. I should add that I had not considered it relevant to consider the first defendant’s suggestion that this case was not brought on in good faith, or the fact that the plaintiff had earlier rejected an award made under WICA.

111    For the reasons earlier given, it is my ruling that the first defendant’s liability for the loss and damage that the plaintiff suffered as a result of the accident is therefore to be reduced by 40%.

112    For completeness, I would mention that with regard to the JV, it was my finding that they have successfully pleaded their defence. The plaintiff not having proven his case against the JV on a balance of probabilities, the JV is not liable in negligence to the plaintiff for his injuries.

## Costs

113    This is a bifurcated trial on liability, with damages to be separately assessed. However, I consider it appropriate that I should decide on the costs for this trial, and leave costs for the assessment of damages to be separately dealt with by the Registrar hearing the assessment of damages. I therefore make the following orders:

> (a)     There shall be Interlocutory Judgment for the Plaintiff to the extent of 60% of the damages to be assessed, with the first defendant bearing the whole 60%;

> (b)     The plaintiff’s claim against the second and third defendants be dismissed; and

> (c)     Cost for this trial on liability is to be reserved to me after damages have been assessed, upon application by the plaintiff.
