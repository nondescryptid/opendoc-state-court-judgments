### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       Periam Rij s/o Mathyalakan (“**the Accused**”) faced 21 charges. Before me, he pleaded guilty to six of these charges (“**proceeded charges**”) and consented to 14 other charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. (The Accused disputed the remaining charge.) The parties’ sentencing positions on the proceeded charges, as well as the sentences that I had imposed, are set out at **Annex A**.

2       The Accused has filed an appeal against sentence.

3       In these grounds of decision, I will focus on those charges where I had rejected the Defence’s sentencing position. These charges are as follows:

4       I will now set out the reasons for my sentencing decision – starting with Charge 5.

## Charge 5: Cheating by personation

### The facts

5       Sometime in the 2nd week of November 2020, the Accused borrowed a handphone from his friend, one Deepashini d/o Palanisamy (“**Deepashini**”). While using the handphone, he noticed that she had an auto login app for Shariot, a vehicle rental company. The Accused recorded Deepashini’s email address which she had used for the app. After returning home, he tried to log into Deepashini’s Shariot account by using her email address. After 10 to 15 attempts at guessing her password, he succeeded. On 17 occasions between 13 November 2020 and 7 December 2020, the Accused used Deepashini’s Shariot account to make vehicle rental bookings. In so doing, he had deceived Shariot into believing that he was Deepashini and dishonestly induced Shariot into approving his rental bookings. The Accused had used Deepashini’s Shariot account to rent vehicles because he did not have a valid driving license.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

### Prescribed punishment

6       Under s 419 of the Penal Code, a person who commits cheating by personation shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both. Given that Charge 5 had been framed as an “amalgamated charge” under s 124(4) of the CPC, the Accused could be sentenced to two times the amount of punishment under s 419: s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC.

### Defence’s submissions

7       The Defence submitted for a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for Charge 5. In making this submission, the Defence highlighted that (a) Deepashini and Shariot (“**the Victims**”) did not suffer any financial loss as the Accused had made full payment for renting the vehicles, (b) the offence did not involve a criminal syndicate or a financial institution, (c) the Accused did not have any antecedent for cheating, and (d) he had cooperated with the authorities by pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

### My decision

#### Cheating by personation is an aggravated form of cheating

8       Cheating is defined in s 415 of the Penal Code as follows:

> **Cheating**

> 415.  Whoever, by deceiving any person, whether or not such deception was the sole or main inducement, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to any person in body, mind, reputation or property, is said to “cheat”.

9       Section 416 of the Penal Code goes on to set out three ways in which a person can be said to commit cheating by personation:

> **Cheating by personation**

> 416.  A person is said to “cheat by personation”, if he _cheats_ \[a\] _by_ pretending to be some other person, or _by_ \[b\] knowingly substituting one person for another, or \[c\] representing that he or any other person is a person other than he or such other person really is.

> \[emphasis and words in square brackets added\]

10     Under s 417 of the Penal Code, cheating is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Comparing the prescribed punishments, cheating by personation under s 419 is clearly an aggravated form of cheating.

#### Sentencing approach for an aggravated offence

11     In the circumstances, what is the sentencing approach when dealing with an aggravated offence such as s 419?

12     In _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1097</span> (“**_Ng Soon Kim_**”), the High Court had the occasion to consider a similar question. There, the offender was convicted under s 324 of the Penal Code of having voluntarily caused hurt _by means of fire_. The High Court noted that an identical harm under s 323 of the Penal Code would be punished more severely under s 324 if dangerous means were used to inflict the harm. To determine the appropriate sentence under s 324, the High Court adopted the following approach:

> (a)     First, consider what would be an appropriate sentence – under the sentencing framework in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> – if the offender had been charged under s 323 based on the hurt alone: _Ng Soon Kim_ at \[12\] and \[13\].

> (b)     Next, apply a suitable _uplift_ to the sentence in (a) above by having regard to the dangerous means used: _Ng Soon Kim_ at \[12\] and \[16\].

> (c)     Finally, calibrate the sentence in (b) above by considering the _offender_\-specific sentencing factors at play: _Ng Soon Kim_ at \[12\] and \[17\].

13     Since _Ng Soon Kim_, the “uplift approach” has been adopted for the following aggravated offences:

> (a)     Section 326 of the Penal Code: _Public Prosecutor v Miya Manik_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 164</span> at \[117\]; _Public Prosecutor v Azlin bte Arujunah_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 168</span> at \[196\] and \[197\]; _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Syafiq bin Mohamed Abbas_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 114</span> at \[28\] – \[30\], and

> (b)     Repeat offence of drug trafficking: _Public Prosecutor v Lai Teck Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 852</span> at \[30\], \[31\] and \[42\].

14     In my view, the uplift approach can similarly be adopted to determine an appropriate sentence for an offence under s 419. This is because the facts that are used to establish an offence under s 419 can also be used to establish an offence under s 417. Furthermore, the sentencing factors that are relevant to an offence under s 417 are also relevant to an offence under s 419. In my view, the extent of the uplift will depend on how the nature and circumstances of the personation have aggravated the offence of cheating. Considering the prescribed punishments in s 419 and s 417, the _maximum extent of the uplift_ will be two years’ imprisonment.

#### Step 1 – Determine the starting point sentence for a s 417 charge

15     Applying the uplift approach to an offence under s 419, the first step is to consider what could be an appropriate starting point sentence had the offender been charged under s 417. In my view, there are two elements which have the greatest influence on the severity of an offence under s 417 and hence its sentence. These are (a) the extent of actual and potential harm arising from the cheating and (b) the extent of the offender’s culpability.

16     I am of the view that the following factors are relevant in assessing the extent of harm arising from an offence under s 417:

> (a)      _The act sought to be induced._ The extent of harm arising from an offence under s 417 is frequently reflected in the nature of the act sought to be induced by the offender (“**induced act**”). For instance, if the deception is to induce the delivery of property, then obviously the value of the property is a relevant sentencing consideration. In some cases, the induced act may not involve the offender securing a financial advantage or the victim suffering a financial disadvantage. An example is where the deception is to induce the victim into performing a sexual act. In such cases, the degree of reprehensibility of the induced act is a relevant sentencing consideration: see e.g., _Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 273</span> (“**_Wong Tian Jun_**”) at \[42\]. Another example is where the deception is to enable the offender to evade detection or arrest for an offence (“**predicate offence**”). In such cases, the gravity of the predicate offence and the extent to which the course of justice is perverted are relevant sentencing considerations.

> (b)      _Other effects of the deception_. There will be cases where the harm caused by the deception extends _beyond_ the induced act. For instance, where the victim suffers psychiatric harm arising from being deceived into providing sex to the offender (_Wong Tian Jun De Beers_ at \[45\]), or where the deception has a larger impact in that affects public safety, public health, public services, public or widely used facilities or public security: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[24(d)\]. These effects are relevant to sentencing.

17     As for assessing the extent of an offender’ culpability, the following factors are relevant:

> (a)      _The offender’s purpose for committing the offence_. It is well-established that an offender’s motive for committing an offence is relevant to sentencing. For instance, the fact that the deception is intended to circumvent Singapore laws, regulatory controls and/or policies is an aggravating factor: _Public Prosecutor v Ng Tai Tee Janet_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 735</span> (“**_Ng Tai Tee Janet_**”) at \[13\] and \[14\].

> (b)      _The degree of premeditation involved in the deception_.

> (c)      _The degree of persistence in perpetrating the deception, including whether it was sustained over a lengthy period_.

> (d)      _Whether the offence involves a fraud on the authorities_: see e.g., _Ng Tai Tee Janet_ at \[13\].

> (e)      _Whether the offence is committed by a syndicate/group_: see e.g., _Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[40\].

> (f)      _Whether the deception involves an abuse of trust and/or responsibility_.

> (g)      _Whether the offender has exploited the victim’s vulnerability_. See e.g., _Public Prosecutor v Brian Reghev Reddy_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 283</span> at \[80\].

18     After determining the starting point sentence based on the offence-specific sentencing factors in \[16\] and \[17\] above, consideration should then be given to the usual _offender_\-specific sentencing factors. Some of these factors are set out in \[47\] below.

#### Step 2 – Apply a suitable uplift based on the nature and circumstances of the personation

19     The next step is to assess what sentencing uplift, if any, ought to be applied given that an offender is convicted of an aggravated form of cheating under s 419. In my judgment, there are _at least_ three scenarios where _the nature and circumstances of the personation_ warrants a sentencing uplift:

> (a)     The first scenario is where the offender has personated _an officer from a public agency_ to commit cheating.

>> (i)       An example is where the offender deceives the victim into believing that he is a law enforcement officer and thus has the legal authority to compel the victim into complying with his demands. Another example is where the offender personates a health official and thus deceives the victim into providing personal data. One species of such personation scams involve purported China officials. According to the Annual Crime Brief 2021 published by the Singapore Police Force on 16 February 2022 (“**Annual Crime Brief**”),[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) there has been an increase in China officials impersonation scams. The Annual Crime Brief provides the following statistics:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.22%"><col width="10.88%"><col width="15.78%"><col width="16.2%"><col width="16.84%"><col width="16.08%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Cases Reported</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount cheated</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2021</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Change from 2020</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2021</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Change from 2020</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Largest amount cheated</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">China Officials Impersonation Scams</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">752</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">+310</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$106.4m</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">+$66.7m</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$6.2m</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

>> (ii)       Deception by personating a public officer is particularly aggravating because the offender exploits the victim’s respect for public authorities, as well as his fears that he may be contravening the laws or be putting his interests at risk by failing to comply with the offender’s demands. If cheating by personation of public officials is not visited with deterrent sentences, public trust in the authorities and compliance with our laws can erode. See also _Public Prosecutor v Goh Shang Han_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 84</span> at \[6\] and _Sivakumar s/o Selvarajah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1142</span> at \[73\] – \[75\].

> (b)     The second scenario is where the offender has personated _an officer from a financial institution_ to commit cheating.

>> (i)       Such offences show worrying signs of increasing. According to the Annual Crime Brief 2021 –

>>> f)        Banking related phishing scams

>>> •       The number of cases increased by 66.9% to 2,237 cases in 2021, from 1,340 cases in 2020.

>>> •       The total amount cheated more than tripled to at least $19.4 million in 2021, from at least $5.3 million in 2020.

>>> •       The largest sum cheated in a single case in 2021 was $1 million.

>>> •       In these cases, culprits impersonated banks or government officials. They approached victims via calls (phone call/in-app calls e.g., WhatsApp), and convinced the victims to provide bank card or account details and OTP, by pretending to assist the victims with issues concerning the victims’ bank card or account. They also sent unsolicited SMSes claiming that there were issues with the victims’ banking account, and the victims were asked to click on a link embedded in the text message to resolve the issue. Upon clicking on the link, the victims were redirected to fake bank websites and asked to key in their internet banking account login details. In some cases, the SMSes would state a phone number, belonging to the scammers, that the victims could call to seek help with their suspended bank card. Subsequently, victims found unauthorised transactions made to their bank account.

>> (ii)       In my view, the following observations in _Public Prosecutor v Koh Seah Wee_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 292</span> (which were made in the context of defrauding public institutions) are equally applicable to cheating by personating officers from financial institutions:

>>> 60    Financial crimes like these often have repercussions beyond the immediate facts of the case. New and more stringent checks may have to be introduced to try to prevent a repeat of the cheating. More levels of authorisation and authentication may have to be put in place. The result is increased costs in time, manpower and possibly infrastructure which would have been quite unnecessary if honesty prevails. …

> (c)     The third scenario is where the offender has illegally used the personal information of another person to perpetuate the cheating.

>> (i)       It bears noting the act of obtaining, retaining, supplying, offering to supply, transmitting, and making available of personal information (commonly known as “identity theft” and “identity fraud”) is an offence under s 416A of the Penal Code 1871. Such an offence attracts a significant punishment of up to three years’ imprisonment and fine of up to $10,000, or both.

>> (ii)       To effectively deter identity theft and identity fraud, stiff sentences ought to be imposed on those who steal and/or illegally use personal data for the purpose of committing cheating by personation. This can be achieved by applying a suitable sentencing uplift in s 419 cases. The extent of the uplift will depend on, among others, the degree of effort the offender had put into illegally obtaining and/or using the personal information.

#### Sentencing approach for amalgamated offences

20     Before explaining how I had applied the above considerations in the sentencing of Charge 5, I wish to address one other issue. Charge 5 is an amalgamated charge. Specifically, the Accused is alleged to have committed 17 incidents of cheating by personation which taken together amount to a “course of conduct”: s 124(4) of the CPC. In the circumstances, what is the sentencing approach when dealing with an amalgamated charge such as Charge 5?

21     To answer this question, it bears noting that an amalgamated charge signals an offender’s higher criminality and the gravity of his course of criminal conduct: _Public Prosecutor v Song Hauming Oskar_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 965</span> at \[69\] – \[74\] and \[81\]. There are several reasons why this is so. A course of conduct can show the scale of an offender’s criminal conduct. The fact that an offender has engaged in a course of criminal conduct may also establish that his offending is neither spontaneous nor out of character.

22     In submitting for four months’ imprisonment for Charge 5, the Defence had relied on four precedents: _Public Prosecutor v Nordin bin Ibrahim_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 156</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Prakash s/o Mathivanan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 284</span> (“**_Prakash_**”); _Sriram s/o Seevalingam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 168</span> (“**_Sriram_**”) and _Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor_ \[2017\] 3 SLR 637. I did not find these precedents to be helpful as they involved facts that are dissimilar to Charge 5. Importantly, none of these precedents involve amalgamated charges. In the circumstances, it would be wrong in principle to apply precedents relating to a single offending conduct to an amalgamated charge: _R v Givemore Tonderei Gezi_ \[2019\] EWCA Crim 286 at \[29\].

23     I am mindful that _Prakash_ and _Sriram_ involve outstanding offences under s 419 of the Penal Code that have been taken into consideration under s 148 of the CPC. In my view, there are important differences between (1) taking into consideration an outstanding offence for the purpose of sentencing and (2) sentencing an amalgamated charge which involve multiple incidents of offending conduct.

> (a)     When a court takes into consideration an outstanding offence for the purpose of sentencing, the court does _not_ convict the offender of that offence – it merely relies on the offender’s admission to that offence as a factor in determining the appropriate sentence. While taking into consideration an outstanding offence will usually result in an enhanced sentence, a separate sentence is _not_ imposed for the outstanding offence. Neither is the offender punished for that offence_: Re Salwant Singh s/o Amer Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 1037</span> at \[48\].

> (b)     On the other hand, when an offender pleads guilty to an amalgamated charge, he is punished for _all_ the incidents of offending in that charge. Such a punishment may exceed the prescribed punishment for the offence. This is evident from s 124(8)(a)(ii) of the CPC which provides that a court may impose a sentence of up to two times the amount of punishment prescribed for that offence. Section 124(8)(a)(ii) was enacted to ensure that the amalgamation of multiple offending conduct into a single charge would not result in a sentencing discount.

24     When sentencing an amalgamated charge such as Charge 5, I am of the view that a court ought to consider the totality of all the incidents of offending conduct amalgamated in that charge. This includes considering (a) the fact that an offender had persisted in a course of criminal conduct over an extended period, (b) the number of victims involved, and (c) the totality of the harm caused, and benefit obtained. The sentence for an amalgamated charge ought to reflect the totality of the offender’s criminality.

25     To achieve this sentencing objective, it has been held that “\[a\] sentencing judge would likely not be faulted if he approached sentencing for \[an amalgamated\] charge in a single step”: _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> at \[23\]. An example what a “single step” approach may entail can be seen in _Public Prosecutor v Song Hauming Oskar_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 965</span> (“**_Oscar Song_**”). In that case, the offender faced one amalgamated charge under s 124(4) of the CPC read with s 417 of the Penal Code. The offender had committed 103 incidents of credit card fraud. The value of the items involved ranged from $3.20 (lowest value) to $749.00 (highest value). The High Court determined the starting point sentence for the offence to be at least 12 months’ imprisonment by considering _total value_ of the wrongful loss/wrongful occasioned by the cheating (i.e., $20,642.48): _Oscar Song_ at \[4\] and \[125\]. Given the low value of the 103 items involved, the offender in _Oscar Song_ would not have received a sentence that commensurate with the totality of his criminality if the Prosecution had framed 103 charges for each incident of credit card fraud (instead of an amalgamated charge), proceeded on only some of these charges, and applied for the remaining charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

26     The approach in _Oscar Song_ works well where the full extent of the harm caused by a course of criminal conduct can be assessed. What if such harm is difficult to assess, or is not the key factor in assessing the severity of the course of criminal conduct and hence its sentence? (For examples of such cases, see \[16(a)\].) Depending on the facts, one way of reflecting the totality of the offender’s criminality in such cases is perhaps (i) to consider what is the sentence that the first incident of offending is likely to attract, (ii) to treat each successive incident of offending as being more serious than the preceding incident of offending and thus warranting progressively heavier punishments, and (iii) then to consider the notional sentence for the last incident of offending as _one of the factors_ influencing the eventual sentence to be imposed.

#### Application of sentencing approach to the facts

27     Having set out the approach for sentencing an offence under s 419 and an amalgamated charge, I will now explain how I had determined the sentence for Charge 5.

28      **_Step 1._** In my view, a starting point sentence of _eight months’ imprisonment_ would reflect the overall gravity of the Accused’s course of criminal conduct. I came to this view based on the following:

> (a)     The Accused had committed the offence in Charge 5 to circumvent the requirement for a driving licence – which he did not have – so that he could drive vehicles. Driving without a licence is a serious offence which affects public safety: see \[38\].

> (b)     The Accused’s offence was premediated and planned. He had formed the intention to cheat when he came to know that Deepashini had an auto login app for Shariot. He persisted in this intention by repeatedly attempting to guess her password. When the Accused succeeded after 10 to 15 tries, he went on to use the app to rent vehicles on 17 occasions during a period lasting for almost a month.

29     In _Public Prosecutor v Chee Wei Jie Joseph_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 10</span> (“**_Chee Wei Jie Joseph_**”), the offender pleaded guilty to several charges – including one charge under s 419 of the Penal Code and another charge for driving a vehicle without a Class 3 driving licence. He had used the NRIC and driving licence belonging to another person to rent a car. Three charges under s 419 and five charges under s 35(1) were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender had various property-related antecedents. His sentence of two months’ imprisonment for a single offending conduct under s 419 – which took into account three other similar charges – was affirmed on appeal. I am of the view that the Accused’s offence is more serious than _Chee Wei Jie Joseph_ and his sentence should reflect the scale of his serial offending.

30      **_Step 2_**. In my view, an _uplift_ of _two weeks’ imprisonment_ would be appropriate.

> (a)     Charge 5 involved the Accused misappropriating Deephasini’s digital identity for his personal benefit. Specifically, he had illegally used Deepashini’s email address and her personal password to the Shariot app. Without Deepashini’s consent, the Accused assumed her digital identity to make vehicle rental bookings on the app.

> (b)     That said, I also noted that the misappropriation of Deephasini’s digital identity was not done in a particularly sophisticated manner. The Accused had come to know that Deepashini’s email address had an auto login to the Shariot app after borrowing her phone. He subsequently managed to know Deepashini’s password by guesswork.

31      **_Antecedents._** Charge 5 is not the first time that the Accused had wrongfully obtaining a benefit that he was not entitled to. He has a string of related antecedents (see below). That said, I noted that these offences were committed while he was below 21 years of age. Furthermore, most of the antecedents are dated. In the circumstances, I _enhanced_ the sentence for Charge 5 by _two weeks_.

32      **_Mitigation plea_**. I am of the view that the factors raised in the Accused’s mitigation plea (see \[7\] above) are neutral factors. If Charge 5 had involved either syndicates or financial institutions, then this would have been an _aggravating_ factor. As for the mitigation plea that the Accused had cooperated with the authorities and had pleaded guilty, the weight of these factors are diminished by the fact that the authorities would not have any difficulty proving Charge 5 against him since (a) he had paid for the bookings and (b) he had been found driving one of these vehicles. In any event, the sheer scale of the Accused’s serial offending overshadows whatever mitigating value there might be in his guilty plea.

33      **_Summary._** Given that (a) the Accused had committed 17 incidents of cheating by personation committed through identity fraud, (b) he had successfully obtained the use of vehicles when he was not entitled to and was not qualified to drive, (c) he has a string of related antecedents, and (d) the maximum sentence under s 419 is five years’ imprisonment, I do not think the sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment is manifestly excessive.

## Charge 7 & Charge 15: Driving without licence

### The facts

34     I now come to the offences in Charge 7 and Charge 15. The facts for these offences are as follows:

> (a)      _Charge 7_. Arising from the offence in Charge 5 (discussed above), the Accused had obtained the use of vehicles from Shariot on 17 occasions between 13 November 2020 and 7 December 2020. On 8 December 2020 at about 1.18 a.m., the Accused was found driving SLM 2524G (“**the Car**”) without a Class 3 driving licence along the service road of Block 223A Sumang Lane. He was released by the Police on the same day after giving his investigations statement.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (b)      _Charge 15._ On 7 October 2021 at about 2.00 p.m., the Accused was _again_ found driving a vehicle without a Class 3 driving licence. This time, he had driven a van GBL 4200B (“**the Van**”) along Block 547D Segar Road. The Accused came into possession of the Van in the following circumstances. In September 2021, the Accused had applied to a logistic company for a delivery job. The job required the employee to have a driving licence. As the Accused did not have one, he used (i) the identity of one “Ashwin Das s/o Xavier” (which he procured over a Telegram chat for $100) and (ii) a police report stating that he had lost his driving licence to support his job application. The logistic company accepted the Accused’s application and handed the Van to him sometime on or after 23 September 2021.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> (c)      _Repeat offender._ Prior to the offences in Charge 7 and Charge 15, the Accused had been convicted for driving without a licence. That conviction was on 19 October 2017, and he was fined $500. On that occasion, the Accused had also consented to three other charges under s 35 of the RTA being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

### Prescribed punishment

35     As the Accused is a repeat offender for the offence of driving without a licence, he is liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 years or to both: s 35(3)(b) of the RTA. By virtue of s 42(1) of the RTA, the Accused could further be ordered to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence.

### Defence’s submissions

36     The Defence submitted for (a) a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment and 12 months’ driving disqualification for Charge 7, and (b) a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment and 24 months’ driving disqualification for Charge 15. According to the Defence, these sentences would be sufficient deterrence for the Accused, as they represented a significant uplift from his previous sentence of $500 for a similar offence in 2017 (“**2017 Antecedent**”).

### My decision

#### Preliminary observations

37     There has not been much judicial comment on the sentencing approach for the offence of driving without a licence. A review of data from the Sentencing Information and Research Repository does not disclose a clear sentencing trend for such offences involving repeat offenders. In a significant number of cases, fines of between $1,000 to $8,000 had been ordered on repeat offenders. Where a custodial sentence had been imposed on repeat offenders, these ranged from between two to eight weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Driving without a licence warrant deterrent sentences

38     Driving without a licence is a serious offence. Deterrent sentences ought to be imposed – especially where it involves a repeat offender.

> (a)     Driving without a licence is dangerous and can have deadly consequences. “If there is an accident and the victim survives, he or his family may suffer long-term problems – sometimes medical; sometimes, permanent disabilities”: second reading speech for the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill in Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (8 July 2019) vol 94. Furthermore, as an unlicenced driver is uninsured, the victim will not have any recourse to compensation via third-party insurance if the offender cannot pay.

> (b)     It also bears noting that a person who drives without having passed the required driving competency tests demonstrates his clear disregard for the lives and safety of other road users. This is because an offence of driving without a licence is seldom committed unwittingly – the offender _knows_ that he does not have a licence to drive, he _knows_ that he is thus prohibited from driving, and yet he _chooses_ to drive.

> (c)     Indeed, Parliament has treated the offence of driving without a licence as being more serious than the offence of drink driving under s 67 of the RTA and as serious as driving whilst under disqualification under s 43 of the RTA. This is clear when one compares the maximum prescribed punishments of these offences: _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2019) (“**_Sentencing Principles_**”) at \[08.044\] and \[11.055\] – \[11.067\].

#### Offence-specific sentencing factors

39     Just like cheating, I am of the view that the two elements that have the greatest influence the severity of an offence of driving without a licence are (a) the level of harm (actual and potential) arising from the offence, and (b) the level of the offender’s culpability.

40     Regarding harm, the relevant sentencing factors include the following:

> (a)      _Whether the offender is a qualified driver_. The mere fact that an offender does not have a licence to drive does not necessarily mean that he is not qualified to drive. An unlicenced driver may be a qualified driver, for instance, (i) where he has failed to renew his driving licence after reaching 65 years of age as required under r 4A of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Driving Licences) Rules, or (ii) where he has a foreign driving licence. Where the facts show that an offender is a qualified driver who poses a lesser risk to road users, this is a relevant sentencing consideration.

> (b)      _Class and type of the vehicle driven_. The class and type of vehicle driven by an offender is relevant to the risks that he poses to road users. For instance, it is more dangerous for an unlicenced driver to have driven a heavy vehicle as it is more difficult to control: _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“**_Edwin Suse Nathen_**”) at \[28\]; _Sue Chang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 176</span> at \[94\]. It is also more dangerous for an unlicenced driver to have driven a high-performance car.

> (c)      _Distance and duration driven_. The distance and duration that an offender has driven is relevant to the level of potential harm that he poses to road users. If an offender has driven for a significant period or distance, this can also be relevant to his _culpability_ – as this demonstrates his persistence in driving without a licence.

> (d)      _Road condition_. The road condition at the time of the offence can affect the level of harm posed by unlicenced driving. For instance, it is more dangerous (i) to drive during rush hour when the traffic volume is heavy, (ii) to drive on the expressway, and (iii) to drive within residential or school zones: _Edwin Suse Nathen_ at \[28\].

> (e)      _Manner of driving_. An offender who has driven aggressively or carelessly poses a greater risk to road users and thus deserves a higher sentence. That said, the fact that an offender did not exhibit any irresponsible or bad driving (e.g., speeding, reckless or dangerous driving) is not a mitigating factor. This is because driving without a licence is inherently dangerous.

> (f)      _Whether the offender’s driving caused or contributed to an accident_. Where the potential harm posed by unlicenced driving materialises into actual harm, then this can further aggravate the offence. For the reason highlighted in (e) above, the mere fact that no harm has been caused is a neutral factor.

41     As for culpability, the relevant sentencing factors include (a) the offender’s reason for driving without licence, and (b) whether he has taken efforts to avoid detection of his offence.

#### Offender-specific sentencing factors

42     Apart from the above offence-specific sentencing factors, the usual offender-specific sentencing factors are also relevant when sentencing an offence of driving without a licence. These include (a) whether the offender has given his consent for driving-related charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, (b) the offender’s degree of remorse for his offence, and (c) whether he has relevant antecedents.

#### Application of sentencing approach to the facts

43     Having stated the applicable sentencing considerations, I now turn to the Accused’s offences.

44     I start by expressing my disagreement with the Defence’s submissions that their proposed sentences (see \[36\] above) would be sufficient deterrence for the Accused because they represent a significant uplift from his sentence for the 2017 Antecedent.

> (a)     In my view, the Accused’s previous sentence of $500 appears to be lenient by current standards. At the time of the 2017 Antecedent, the maximum sentence for a first-time offence of driving without licence was only $1,000, or three months’ imprisonment, or both. Given that three other similar charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, a higher sentence would have been reasonable for the 2017 Antecedent. One reason why a fine of only $500 was imposed could be that the Accused was only 20 years old at the time of sentencing.

> (b)     In any event, Parliament has signalled its intent to deter irresponsible driving by significantly enhancing the prescribed punishment for several traffic offences in 2019. In the case of driving without a licence, the maximum fine was enhanced by between 10-fold (first time offender) to 20-fold (repeat offender), and the maximum imprisonment term was enhanced by 12-fold (for first time and repeat offenders). Parliament’s decision to set the prescribed punishment for driving without a licence at such a high level is not surprising given the seriousness of the offence: see \[38\] above.

45     It is well-established that a sentence ought to be proportionate not only to the culpability of the offender but also in the context of the legislative scheme”: _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> at \[87\]. What this means is that “where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences, courts have a duty to ensure that the full spectrum is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence”: _Ong Chee Eng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> at \[24\]. Thus, when determining the sentence for an offending conduct, in line with the cardinal proportionality principle, a court must consider where it fits within the different levels of severity for the offence (e.g., whether it is of low, moderate, or high severity): _Sentencing Principles_ at \[11.015\] – \[11.043\].

46     In this regard, based on the offence-specific sentencing factors set out at \[39\] – \[41\] above, I found that the offences in Charge 7 and Charge 15 are of low to moderate severity. I came to this finding based on the following:

47     My assessment of the _offender-specific sentencing factors_ in the present case are as follows:

> (a)     I am mindful that the Accused had pleaded guilty. In my view, the extent of sentencing discount for his guilty plea on Charge 7 and Charge 15 should be minimal. This is because for both offences, it is not disputed that the Accused had been found driving the vehicles without a licence. In these circumstances, the Accused had no choice but to plead guilty.

> (b)     What is disturbing is that the Accused has a propensity to drive without licence.

>> (i)       Prior to the offences in Charge 7 and Charge 15, the Accused had faced four charges for driving without a licence and one charge for speeding under s 63(4) of the Road Traffic Act. In 2017, he pleaded to one charge of driving without a licence and one charge of speeding and had given his consent for the remaining three charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

>> (ii)       When the Accused pleaded guilty to Charge 7 and Charge 15, he had also consented to two similar charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. These are DAC-903370-2022 (“**Charge 12**”) and MAC-903747-2022 (“**Charge 16**”).

>> (iii)       The offences in Charge 12, Charge 15 and Charge 16 were committed _less than two months_ after he was charged in court for Charge 7: see **Annex B** at s/n 10A, 12, 15 and 16.

> By continuing to repeatedly drive without a licence, the Accused had displayed an utter disregard for the law and safety of road users.

48     Given the above considerations and bearing in mind the maximum prescribed punishment for a repeat offender who drives without a licence, I decided that a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment and five years’ disqualification from holding all classes of driving licence is appropriate for each of the offences in Charge 7 and Charge 15. I agreed with the Defence’s submission that the driving disqualification are to commence on the date that the Accused completes his imprisonment sentence.

## Charge 1: Member of unlawful society

### Defence’s submission

49     Finally, I come to Charge 1. For this offence, the Defence had submitted that the sentence of two months’ imprisonment be ordered to run concurrently with the rest of the sentences. This submission was based on the one-transaction rule.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

### My decision

50     In my view, it is wrong to treat the offence in Charge 1 and the rest of the proceeded charges as having been committed in one transaction.

> (a)     In _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“**_Mohamed Shouffee_**”), the High Court explained that the rationale of the one-transaction rule:

>> 30    … is found in the principle that consecutive sentences are not appropriate if the various offences involve a ‘single invasion of the same legally protected interest’ (see D A Thomas, _Principles of Sentencing_ (Heinemann, 2nd Ed, 1979) at p 53):

>>> The essence of the one-transaction rule appears to be that _consecutive sentences are inappropriate when all the offences taken together constitute a single invasion of the same legally protected interest_. The principle applies where two or more offences arise from the same facts — as when the same series of blows constitutes assault occasioning actual bodily harm and wilful ill treatment of a child, or malicious wounding and indecent assault — _but the fact that the two offences are committed simultaneously or close together in time does not necessarily mean that they amount to a single transaction._ … \[emphasis added\]

>> 31    On this formulation, the real basis of the one-transaction rule is unity of the violated interest that underlies the various offences. Where multiple offences are found to be proximate as a matter of fact but violate different legally protected interests, then they would not, at least as a general rule, be regarded as forming a single transaction. However, it should be said for the avoidance of doubt that even if this offers a better rationale for the one-transaction rule, that does not make it a test which is to be rigidly applied. As will be evident from the analysis that is set out below, even where a sentencing judge is able to identify that a set of offences violates different legally protected interests, it does not always or necessarily follow that those offences cannot be regarded as part of the same transaction.

> (b)     The legally protected interest in Charge 1 – i.e., to prohibit the association of 10 or more persons which has not been registered under the Societies Act – is different from the rest of the charges. Furthermore, there is no proximity in time, place, continuity of action, or continuity in purpose or design between Charge 1 and the other proceeded charges: _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[39\].

51     For completeness, I should add that ordering the sentence for Charge 1 to run consecutively with the rest of the sentences will result in an aggregate sentence of 11 months and 34 weeks’ imprisonment (i.e., about 19 months and two weeks’ imprisonment).

> (a)     In my view, the aggregate sentence is in keeping with the Accused’s past record. The Accused has antecedents for a whole spectrum of offences – including unlicensed moneylending, snatch theft and attempted robbery, drug consumption, and traffic-related offences. For his previous brushes with the law, the Accused had been placed on probation, in a juvenile home, and in a reformative training centre.

> (b)     Additionally, I am of the view that the aggregate sentence will not be crushing on the Accused. He is only about 25 years old at the time of sentencing. The Accused will be able to continue to lead a productive life after completing his sentence.

## Conclusion

52     Following up on my last point, it is my sincere hope that the Accused will use his time in prison to learn from his past mistakes and reflect on how he can lead a meaningful life as a law-abiding citizen after his release from prison.
