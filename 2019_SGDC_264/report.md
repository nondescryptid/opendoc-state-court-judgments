### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Part 1   Introduction – Charges, Sentence and Appeal

1       On 6 November 2019, the Accused pleaded guilty to three charges, namely, unauthorised consumption of a Class A controlled drug (DAC 933411/2018) , unauthorised possession of a Class A controlled drug (DAC 933412/2018) and abusive behaviour towards a public servant (MAC 902433/2019).

2       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) (marked as ‘P1’) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

3       The Accused then admitted to the commission of three more charges, and consented to have these three charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence.

4       After hearing the Prosecution’s oral address on sentence and the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation (both written and oral), I imposed the following individual sentences:

5       The sentences of imprisonment in DAC 933411/2018 and MAC 902433/2019 were ordered to run consecutively, and that in DAC 933412/2018 to run concurrently. The total sentence was therefore three years, six months and three weeks’ imprisonment.

7       The Accused was dissatisfied with the sentences imposed, and he has filed an appeal against sentence. The Accused was released on bail pending appeal.

## Part 2   Facts of the Case

### A   Arrest of the Accused and follow-up investigations

8       On 18 July 2018, at about 6.55 p.m., outside the Singapore Pools outlet at Block 960 Jurong West Street 92, the Accused was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) on suspicion of having committed some offences under the MDA.

9       The CNB officers brought the Accused to his rental unit at Block 967A Jurong West Street 93, #XXX (“the Unit”). Inside the Unit, several items believed to contain controlled drugs were found. The Accused admitted to the ownership of the items and the CNB officers seized the items accordingly. The Accused was then taken to the Police ‘A’ Division where two bottles of the Accused’s urine samples were procured for analysis by analysts from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”).

### B   Results of analysis of the Accused’s urine samples

10     The two bottles of the Accused’s urine samples were sent to the HSA on 19 July 2018. The results of the analysis showed as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.7%"> <col width="24.82%"> <col width="41.48%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>HSA Certificate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Name of Analyst</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Results of Analysis</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">AT-1833-06988-001-11 dated 10 August 2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Ng Chee Ann</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="2" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Accused’ urine samples were found to contain</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2</b>-[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and its hexanoic isomer and their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">AT-1833-06988-002-11 dated 7 August 2018</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Maggie Tiong Su Su</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

11     2-\[1-(5-Fluoropentyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamido\]-3,3-dimethylbutanoic acid and its hexanoic isomer and their respective fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group are Class A controlled drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

12     Prior to the Accused’s arrest, he had knowingly consumed the aforesaid controlled drug without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

13     The Accused is a repeat offender for the offence of unauthorised consumption of a controlled drug. The Memorandum of Previous Convictions (“Memorandum”) (marked as ‘P3’) adduced by the Prosecution showed that the Accused was convicted on 3 July 2012 of an offence of consumption of a Specified Drug, namely, morphine, under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punished under s 33A of the MDA. The Accused was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The said conviction and sentence have not been set aside. The Accused was thus liable for enhanced punishment under s 33(4) of the MDA for the current offence of unauthorised consumption of a controlled drug (_i.e._ DAC 933411/2018).

### C   Results of analysis of the items seized from the Accused’s Unit

14     Relating to the charge DAC 933412/2018, the seized items that were believed to contain controlled drugs were marked by the CNB as “MS-A1”, “MS-A2”, “MS-B1A”, “MS-B1B’ and “MS-D1”. These five items, together with other seized items, were sealed in tamper proof bags before they were sent to the HSA for analysis.

15     The results of the analysis showed as follows:

16     The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to possess the aforesaid controlled drugs.

17     The Accused is a repeat offender for the offence of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug. The Memorandum showed that the Accused was convicted on 20 August 1996 of an offence of possession of a controlled drug, namely, diamorphine, under s 8(a) of the MDA and punished under s 33A of the MDA. This was the Accused’s second conviction for the commission of the same offence. The Accused was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment. The said conviction and sentence have not been set aside. The Accused was thus liable for enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA for the current offence of unauthorised possession of a controlled drug (_i.e._ DAC 933412/2018).

### D   Facts pertaining to MAC 902433/2019

18     The portions of the SOF which are pertinent to the commission of the above captioned offence by the Accused are reproduced below:

> 18    The informant is Tan Hui Ni, a 19-year-old female Singaporean.

> 19    The victim is Tan Jun Hern Damian (“SC/Cpl Damian”), a 19-year-old Singaporean. The victim is a full-time National Serviceman of the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) holding the rank of a Special Constabulary Corporal. At the material time, SC/Cpl Damian was attached to the Nanyang Neighbourhood Police Centre (“Nanyang NPC”). SC/Cpl Damian is a public servant under s 21(1)(g) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 20    The witness is Lau Tuck Wei Jeremy (“Sgt Jeremy”), a 24-year-old male Chinese holding the rank of a Sergeant in the SPF. At the material time, Sgt Jeremy was attached to the Nanyang NPC.

> 21    On 26 February 2019, at about 11.06 p.m., an anonymous member of the public reported to the Police that “There is a fight going on here. I am hearing commotion.” The incident location was given as at the 9th floor of Block 967A Jurong West St 93, Singapore (“Block 976A”).

> 22    Sgt Jeremy and SC/Cpl Damian responded to the incident and met the informant on the 9th floor of Block 967A. She informed the two police officers that earlier, the accused and his fellow flat occupant were arguing along the corridor on the 9th floor of Block 967A. The accused was inebriated and the flat occupant was seen trying to stop him. However, they had already left the scene.

> 23    Sgt Jeremy and SC/Cpl Damian then left and went to the void deck of Block 967A. At the void deck, Sgt Jeremy spotted the accused in an agitated demeanour and he was coming out of the lift lobby. The accused saw the two police officers. The accused then asked Sgt Jeremy and random strangers at the void deck as to who had complained against him and what they were doing.

> 24    The accused then brought the two police officers to his Unit. From the lift lobby to his Unit, the accused became agitated. At about 11.13 p.m., the accused was abusive in his language towards the two police officers and he shouted loudly throughout the incident. Sgt Jeremy tried to calm the accused but to no avail. Sgt Jeremy gave several warnings to the accused. The accused refused to comply to keep the peace and Sgt Jeremy therefore arrested the accused for disorderly behaviour.

> 25    Sgt Jeremy then brought the accused down to the void deck of Block 967A, to escort him to the Woodlands Police Division. In the Police vehicle, the accused continued in his abusive behaviour towards SC/Cpl Damian by uttering abusive words at him.

> 26    Based on the Body Worn Camera of SC/Cpl Damian, it was revealed that between 26 February 2019 at about 11.13 p.m., and 27 February 2019 at about 12.16 a.m., at the void deck of Block 967A, and in the Police vehicle, the accused did use abusive behaviour towards SC/Cpl Damian, a public servant, by uttering the following abusive words:

>> i.    “I’m a Singapore taxpayer you know, “_Cheebye_” in Hokkien dialect which means “cunt” in English language;

>> ii.    Understand me or not, you idiot;

>> iii.   I throw shit at on your face;

>> iv.    One more time lah brother I will throw shit on your face.

>>> Most to most three months only brother;

>> v.    Fucking hell you all NS you know;

>> vi.    you come to my house I will throw shit on you; and

>> vii.   you want to see my cock?”

> which were directed at him, in relation to the execution of his duty as such public servant. The accused’s acts were also witnessed by Sgt Jeremy.

19     The Accused has committed the above offence whilst he was out in bail for the MDA offences set out in paragraphs \[7\] to \[16\] above.

## Part 3   Sentence

### A   Prosecution’s Position on Sentence

20     In respect of the two controlled drug offences (DAC 933411/2018 and DAC 933412/2018), the Prosecution highlighted the following:

> (a)     The Accused was a third time offender for the possession offences; and

> (b)     The Accused’s last conviction for a consumption offence was in July 2012 for which he was given a custodial term of seven years’ imprisonment and six stokes of the cane.

In view of these drug related antecedents, the Prosecution submitted that there should be an uplift of six months’ imprisonment to the respective mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment for the consumption charge (_i.e._ DAC 933411/2018) and the possession charge (_i.e._ DAC 933412/2018).

21     For the POHA charge (_i.e._ MAC 902433/2019), the Prosecution highlighted that the Accused’s abusive behaviour persisted for over 10 minutes. In addition, two similar POHA charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. Lastly, the Prosecution highlighted another aggravating factor, namely, that the Accused has committed the POHA offences when the Accused was on bail for the controlled drug offences. Nonetheless, the Prosecution submitted that a fine of between $3000 to $4000 would suffice. The Prosecution submitted that an in-default imprisonment term of two weeks should be imposed in the event that the Accused is unable to pay the fine.

22     In summary, the Prosecution’s sentencing position was:

### B   Plea-in-Mitigation

23     Counsel submitted that the Accused’s early plea of guilty is a strong mitigation factor and the Accused has shown extreme remorse for his offending.

24     Counsel also submitted that the Accused is a changed person. The Accused’s mother passed away about two weeks before his release from prison from his previous stint in prison. According to Counsel, the Accused’s late mother’s words “_change your ways, get married, life \[sic\] a good life_” still resonate with the Accused to date. Arising therefrom, the Accused was determined to change for the better.

25     Through his Counsel’s written Mitigation Plea (marked as ‘D1’), the Accused apologised to the police officers involved in the POHA charges.

26     The Accused has tendered a personal Letter of Mitigation (attached to ‘D1”). Briefly, the Accused stated that he led a nomadic life, staying in parks and friends’ flats after his release from prison in October 2016. He managed to secure a rental flat and moved in towards the end of 2017. He could not find a permanent job because of his criminal records. He sustained himself by doing odd jobs. Despite his personal hardship, he would provide monthly financial contributions to his elder sister. Over the past three years, he has managed to renew his ties with his siblings and extended family members. The support from his family has given him added impetus to start life afresh. He plans to obtain a Class 3 driving licence with a view of getting a better paying job as a delivery driver. The Accused claimed that he has taken all the necessary precautions to stay away from his old circle of acquaintances in order to avoid relapsing into his drugs consumption habit. The Accused also stated his commitment to remain crime free, and to work towards his own recovery.

27     On account of the following three factors:

> (a)     the Accused’s plea of guilt;

> (b)     the Accused’s remorse; and

> (c)     the positive attitude shown by the Accused to change for the better,

Counsel sought a lenient sentence from the court.

28     In brief, Counsel’s sentencing position was:

### C   Court’s Response to Counsel’s Plea-In-Mitigation

29     I shall first deal with Counsel’s plea-in-mitigation made on the Accused’s behalf.

30     On the issue of remorse, I did not find any genuine remorse emanating from the Accused. Despite stating that his late mother’s words have resonated with him to date, the Accused had gone back to consuming and possessing controlled drugs without any valid authorisation. He was arrested on 18 July 2018 for the controlled drugs offences. Within 7 months of that arrest, he re-offended on 26 Feb 2019 with the POHA offences.

31     I have also observed that there was scant evidence suggesting that the plea of guilt was an expression of genuine remorse or contrition. It was more a realisation of the fact on the part of the Accused that the Prosecution has overwhelming evidence against him, and he has little choice but to plead guilty: _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> (“_BDB_”) at \[74\]. Nevertheless, by pleading guilty, the Accused has indeed saved Court’s time and Prosecution’s resources. However, the weight to be attached is significantly reduced given the late stage in which the plea was entered. Finally, other than the Accused’s plea of guilt, the rest of the Accused’s mitigation plea carried no mitigating value.

### D   Court’s Decision on Sentence

32     In my judgment, I held the view that specific deterrence was one of the predominant sentencing considerations in this case. Specific deterrence relates to the effect that the punishment might have in persuading an offender to refrain from committing such offences again by fashioning an appropriate sentence that takes into account the nature of the offence and the accused’s peculiar disposition: _Public Prosecutor v Loqmanul Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> (_“Loqmanul”_) at \[25\] – \[29\].

33     The Accused is a repeat offender for controlled drugs offences. He is clearly a recalcitrant. His criminal records showed that he has three sets of conviction for consumption of a controlled drug; two sets of conviction for possession of controlled drugs; and six occasions of being incarcerated at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for six months each, two of which were extended for another 15 months and 17 months respectively. The need for specific deterrence on the Accused thus warranted an uplift of six months each, in addition to the respective mandatory minimum imprisonment terms for the consumption offence (_i.e._ DAC 933411/2018) and the possession offence (_i.e._ DAC 933412/2018). The presence of another possession offence (_i.e._ DAC 933413/2018), which was taken into consideration, further fortifies the argument for an uplift of the sentence (_vis-à-vis_ the proceeded charge in DAC 933412).

34     In respect of the POHA charge (i.e. MAC 902433/2019), the police officers had attended to the scene to maintain peace and order. Whilst so doing, they were confronted with the abusive behaviour of the Accused. The vulgar language and obscenities used by the Accused were captured on the police officer’s body worn camera. In my assessment, the evidence against the Accused for the said offence was overwhelming. The Prosecution submitted that the abuse lasted over 10 minutes. This submission is incorrect. I believed that the Prosecution was referring to the other two POHA charges that were taken into consideration for sentencing. For the proceeded POHA charge (_i.e._ MAC 902433/2019), the verbal abuse occurred over a longer time span – from 26 February 2019 @ 11:13 p.m. to 27 February 2019 @ 12:16 a.m. (see paragraph \[26\] of the SOF). In my assessment, I found the Accused to be utterly disrespectful to the police officers. I also found that he simply has no regard for the rule of law. I found the Accused’s culpability to be in the medium category. For these reasons, I was unable to accept the Prosecution’s submission that a fine between $3000 to $4000 would suffice. In my judgment, the custodial threshold for the POHA charge (_i.e._ MAC 902433/2019) has been crossed. The Accused’s plea of guilt was insufficient to justify the imposition of a fine. It was my assessment that the indicative starting point for the POHA charge (_i.e._ MAC 902433/2019) is two weeks’ imprisonment.

35     Two other similar POHA charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. A perusal of the said two charges revealed that the Accused didn’t simply abused one police officers in that tirade. He was indiscriminately abusing police officers who came in contact with him. Different sets of vulgarities were uttered at different police officers. In the circumstances, there should be an uplift of the sentence from the starting indicative point. The Accused has committed the POHA offences whilst still on bail for the controlled drugs offences. This is another an aggravating factor: _Loqmanul_ at \[54\] – \[59\]. The only factor in the Accused’s favour was his plea of guilt. In the final analysis, I was of the view that the aggravating factors outweighed the plea of guilt. An uplift of one week’s imprisonment to the indicative starting point was adequate in my view. I therefore imposed a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment for the POHA charge (_i.e._ MAC 902433/2019).

36     An offender who has committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively: _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\] – \[46\]. Applying this guideline, I ordered the sentences for the consumption offence (_i.e._ DAC 933411/2018) to run consecutively with the POHA offence (_i.e._ MAC 902433/2019); and the sentence for the possession offence (_i.e._ DAC 933412/2018) to run concurrently, making a total sentence of three years, six months and three weeks’ imprisonment.

## Part 4   Conclusion

37     For the reasons given above, the total sentence was therefore three years, six months and three weeks’ imprisonment.
