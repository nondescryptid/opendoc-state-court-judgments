### Deputy Registrar Andre Sim Jun Yi:

## Introduction

1       This is an action brought by the plaintiff (the “**Plaintiff**”), a Bangladeshi national, in respect of a road traffic accident on 18 January 2018. At the material time, the Plaintiff was 35 years old and employed as a construction worker by the second defendant construction company. He rode as a passenger in the second defendant’s lorry, which was being driven by the first defendant. The lorry collided into the rear of a bus, causing the Plaintiff to sustain various personal injuries.

2       The Plaintiff commenced proceedings against both defendants (“**Defendants**”) on 1 August 2019. He claimed that the first defendant had been negligent in driving the lorry, and that the second defendant was liable as his employer. On 6 April 2020, consent interlocutory judgment was entered in favour of the Plaintiff against the Defendants for 100% of the damages to be assessed.

3       In the present assessment of damages, the Plaintiff claims general damages for: (a) pain and suffering from his personal injuries; (b) loss of future earnings (“**LFE**”); (c) post-trial loss of earning capacity (“**LEC**”); and (d) future medical expenses. He also claims special damages comprising: (a) pre-trial loss of earnings; as well as (b) medical and transport expenses incurred to date.

4       In dealing with these claims, two significant legal issues arise for my consideration. First, on the issue of LEC, parties dispute the applicable legal test to be met. Two key Court of Appeal decisions appear to have taken differing approaches as to whether a plaintiff must show a ‘substantial or real risk’ of losing his ‘present job’ in order to be entitled to an award for LEC. Such a requirement was applied by the Court of Appeal in _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“**_Samuel Chai_**”), but not in its later decision of _Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 145</span> (“**_Lua Bee Kiang_**”). In this judgment, I explore the underlying rationale for the requirement, and distil the relevant principles as to the appropriate legal test to be applied to different fact-patterns.

5       Second, an issue of overcompensation also emerges. It is well-established that at a _conceptual level_, LFE and LEC are distinct heads of damages meant to compensate for different losses (_Samuel Chai_ at \[10\] and \[20\]). To my mind, however, this does not necessarily mean that the two heads of damages will _never_ overlap in any factual situation. In the present case, it falls to be decided whether any overlap exists between the awards for LFE and LEC sought, so as to trigger the rule against double recovery.

## Parties’ cases and the assessment hearing

6       At the assessment hearing, only the Plaintiff was called as a witness. Parties agreed to dispense with the attendance of the medical experts who had examined the Plaintiff. The said experts were accordingly not cross-examined on their medical reports, which were admitted into evidence without challenge. The said medical reports were as follows:

> (a)     A medical report by Dr Liu Ren Jie of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (Emergency Medicine Department) dated 23 April 2018 (“**Dr Liu’s medical report**”) in respect of the Plaintiff’s initial consultation on the day of the accident, 18 January 2018.

> (b)     A medical report by Dr Hannah Ng of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (Department of Orthopaedic Surgery) dated 18 June 2018 (“**Dr Ng’s medical report**”) in respect of the Plaintiff’s consultation with the orthopaedic department on 23 February 2018.

> (c)     A specialist medical report by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Lee Soon Tai of Osteoporosis Clinic and Orthopaedic Surgery dated 26 December 2018 (“**Dr Lee’s specialist medical report**”) in respect of his medical examination of the Plaintiff on 2 March 2018.

> (d)     A specialist medical report by a consultant neurosurgeon, Dr Keith Goh from International Neurosurgery Associates Pte Ltd dated 9 July 2018 (“**Dr Goh’s specialist medical report**”) in respect of his medical examination of the Plaintiff on 2 March 2018. This report focussed on the “brain and neurological injuries” suffered by the Plaintiff.

7       Parties’ respective positions on the Plaintiff’s various heads of claim are summarised as follows:

8       I deal with each head of claim in turn.

## General Damages

### Pain and suffering

#### Applicable legal principles

9       Assessing damages for non-pecuniary losses (like pain and suffering) is inherently difficult because such losses are not easy to quantify and do not lend themselves to straightforward mathematical calculation. The guiding principle is that of “fair compensation”, which means that compensation ought to be reasonable and just. It need not be “absolute” or “perfect” (_Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[9\]).

10     As explained in _Lua Bee Kiang_ (at \[9\]-\[12\]), there are traditionally two methods for assessing damages for pain and suffering:

> (a)     The component method, by which the loss arising from each item or head of damage is separately quantified and then added up to estimate the overall loss that the claimant has suffered.

> (b)     The global method, by which all the injuries sustained by the claimant are considered holistically to arrive at an estimation of his overall loss.

The principle behind the component method is that damages should be awarded for losses or heads of damage that may properly be regarded as distinct or discrete. However, the court must also ensure that the overall quantum awarded is a reasonable sum that reflects the totality of the claimant’s injuries. This latter point is the principle which animates the global method. The two methods are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. They are simply different practical modes of producing a fair estimate of the claimant’s loss.

11     In cases where multiple injuries are suffered, the Court of Appeal in _Lua Bee Kiang_ has held (at \[12\]-\[18\]) that a two-stage analysis should be adopted:

> (a)     At the first stage, the component method should be applied to ensure that the loss arising from each distinct item or head of damage is accounted for and quantified. Reference may be made to assessment guidelines at this stage, but it must be remembered that they are no more than guidelines.

> (b)     At the second stage, the global method should be applied to ensure that the overall award is reasonable and neither excessive nor inadequate. This exercise is guided by at least two considerations. First, to avoid overcompensation, the court should take into account any “overlapping” injuries, that is, injuries which either (i) together resulted in pain that would not have been differentially felt by the claimant or (ii) together gave rise to only a single disability. Second, the court should then consider the relevant precedents to reach a fair estimate and to ensure that like cases were treated alike.

12     In the present case, the Plaintiff claims to have suffered injuries to his pelvis, head, back, right shoulder and chest as a result of the accident. In assessing the appropriate quantum of damages for pain and suffering, I am guided by the indicative ranges set out in Charlene Chee _et al_, _Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases_ (Academy Publishing, 2010) (“**the Guidelines**”). Parties also refer me to the case digests set out in Carrie Chan _et al, Practitioner’s Library – Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal Accidents_ (Lexis Nexis, 3rd Ed, 2017) (“**the Blue Book**”), which I deal with in the course of my assessment below. Insofar as these authoritative guides are concerned, I am cognisant that they were issued some years ago and as such, an upward adjustment to account for inflation ought to be made as appropriate. At the end of the day, the quantum of damages for pain and suffering must reflect the totality of the plaintiff’s injuries.

#### Stage 1: Applying the component method

##### (1)   Pelvis fractures

13     The Plaintiff suffered right-sided superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, as well as a right-sided acetabular fracture. This was treated conservatively with analgesia and the Plaintiff was given hospitalisation leave. He was later referred to a physiotherapist and occupational therapist at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital for rehabilitation. Dr Lee’s specialist medical report assessed that there was a limited range of right hip flexion, extension, abduction and internal rotation which “could be awarded 14% permanent incapacity”. There was also wasting of the right thigh muscle (2.5cm) and calf muscle (2cm) as compared to the left.

14     For these pelvis injuries, parties submit as follows:

> (a)     The Plaintiff’s counsel submits a figure of S$20,000 for pain and suffering. This falls within Chapter 6(J)(a)(iii) of the Guidelines for severe pelvis and hip injuries requiring partial or total hip replacement surgery and which result in “significant disabilities”. The range indicated for this category is S$18,000 to S$25,000.

> (b)     The Defendants’ counsel submits a figure of S$6,000. This falls within the range of S$5,500 to S$8,000 in Chapter 6(J)(c) of the Guidelines for “significant injuries to the pelvis…with little or no residual disability in the long run”.

15     In my judgment, parties’ submissions either overstate or understate the severity of the plaintiff’s pelvis injuries. Given that there were multiple fractures present, it is evident that initial injury to the Plaintiff’s pelvis was moderately serious although it was treated conservatively without surgery. As to the existence of residual disabilities, the medical reports do record that the Plaintiff had complained of multiple difficulties with his daily living activities, including walking, climbing up the stairs and bathing. Ultimately, however, the medical expert opinions did not substantiate the presence of such major disabilities. Indeed, the Plaintiff’s own closing submissions do not even refer to or seek to rely on such supposed difficulties. Nevertheless, I still accept that the Plaintiff does suffer from _some_ residual disability given the findings in Dr Lee’s specialist medical report mentioned at \[13\] above – namely, that there is some limitation in hip extension, abduction and internal rotation, as well as muscle wasting. I also accept Dr Lee’s opinion that due to “residual pain over his vertex, sternum, low back and right groin together with stiffness of his back and right hip”, the Plaintiff would have difficulty meeting the demands of his pre-accident occupation as a construction worker.

16     That being the case, I cannot agree with the Defendants that there is little to no residual disability suffered. I equally do not think that the residual issues above amount to “significant disabilities”, as the Plaintiff’s submission suggests. Instead, I refer to the range indicated in Chapter 6(J)(b) of the Guidelines for moderate pelvis injuries. The range is S$8,000 to S$18,000 and this category applies where:

> …\[t\]here is significant injury to the pelvis or hip but substantial recovery is achieved in one or two years with no major permanent disability. An award in the higher range is appropriate where there is a significant risk of osteoarthritis. Cases under this category also include injuries of limited severity where hip replacement surgery is carried out successfully or where hip replacement surgery may be necessary in the foreseeable future. Prognosis, however is good.

In the present case, there is no evidence that that the pelvis fractures will lead to any enhanced risk of osteoarthritis, or that the Plaintiff has undergone or may need to undergo any hip surgery. Bearing in mind that multiple pelvis fractures were sustained and that there is some residual disability, I place the Plaintiff’s pelvis injuries at the lower end of the range and will award S$11,500 as damages for pain and suffering.

17     I add that the precedent cases cited by the Plaintiff to justify a higher award are also plainly distinguishable. The decisions in _Ng Ng Mui v Ibrahim Bin Mohamad_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] SGHC 196</span> and _Lee Seng Ming v Tan Kim Soon and Anor_ (Unreported, DC Suit No. 1330 of 2009) were mentioned, but the pelvis injuries and residual disabilities sustained by the plaintiffs in those cases were clearly more severe than those suffered here.

18     The Plaintiff also refers to the Blue Book’s case digest of the High Court decision in _Bong Hwee Haw v Silviu Ionescu_ (Unreported, High Court Suit No. 437 of 2010) (“**_Bong Hwee Haw_**”). In that case, the plaintiff suffered fractures of the right superior and inferior pubic rami. As this was an unreported decision, however, no detailed reasons were given for the damages awarded and the summarised facts of the case (as set out in the Blue Book) lack sufficient particularity to enable a meaningful comparison to be made. As observed by the learned Deputy Registrar in _Azana Binte Atan v Kwa Yin En_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 56</span> at \[24\], the Blue Book does not provide details about the treatment of plaintiff’s pelvis injuries in _Bong Hwee Haw._ The High Court’s award of $25,000 for the plaintiff’s pelvis fractures also took into account the plaintiff’s pain and suffering for “multiple scars” but the nature and extent of the scarring are unknown. In the circumstances, I do not think that _Bong Hwee Haw_ is of much assistance in the present case.

##### (2)   Mild head injury with post-concussion syndrome and frontal scalp laceration

19     The Plaintiff claims S$10,000 for a mild head injury which has allegedly resulted in persistent headaches and post-concussion syndrome. According to the Plaintiff, his head injury falls within the range for minor brain damage (between S$8,000 and S$25,000) in Chapter 1(A)(d) of the Guidelines. The Plaintiff also claims another S$2,000 for a 4cm frontal scalp laceration which he sustained.

20     The Defendants’ position is that a global award of S$1,000 ought to be made for the Plaintiff’s mild head injury and frontal scalp laceration. In particular, the Defendants argue that the Plaintiff’s mild head injury and its resulting symptoms are not as serious as alleged.

21     First, I accept that the Plaintiff did sustain a mild head injury which has resulted in persistent headaches as well as post-concussion syndrome. This was in fact the assessment made by the consultant neurosurgeon, Dr Goh, in his specialist medical report. The report was based on a review of the Plaintiff’s earlier medical reports, a clinical examination of the Plaintiff less than two months after the accident, as well as the Plaintiff’s own self-reported complaints.

22     The Defendants contend, however, that there are “some inconsistencies” between Dr Goh’s specialist medical report and the Plaintiff’s other medical reports. It is said that these inconsistencies show that the Plaintiff’s alleged (neurological) symptoms are not as severe as suggested, or that the said symptoms have “alleviated which may obviate the need for future medical treatment”. The Defendants elaborate as follows:

> (a)     First, there is an inconsistency between Dr Liu’s medical report and Dr Goh’s specialist medical report. At the Plaintiff’s initial medical examination at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on 18 January 2018, it was noted by Dr Liu that “the Plaintiff did not experience loss of consciousness, amnesia, vomiting or giddiness”. This contradicts the findings made by Dr Goh in the later medical examination on 2 March 2018, where it was noted that “\[a\]s a result of the head injury, \[the Plaintiff\] had and continues to have chronic and persistent symptoms of headache and post-concussion syndrome”.

> (b)     Second, there is also an inconsistency between Dr Lee’s and Dr Goh’s specialist medical reports. Both doctors had examined the Plaintiff on the same day of 2 March 2018. However, Dr Lee had observed that on examination that “\[the Plaintiff\] was alert, coherent and rational. His speech was distinct and he was able to respon\[d\] to the questions during the interview, as well as orientated \[_sic_\] in person, space and time”. It appears, therefore, that the Plaintiff had the debilitating aftereffects of his head injury (_ie_, persistent headaches and giddiness) only for the purpose of Dr Goh’s examination, but not Dr Lee’s.

23     It bears emphasis that despite raising these contentions now, the Defendants chose not to cross-examine any of the doctors on their medical reports. I am thus left to consider the medical expert evidence on the face of the documents. Ultimately, I am not persuaded that the alleged inconsistencies pointed out by the Defendants materially undermine Dr Goh’s assessment:

> (a)     I accept that at the Plaintiff’s initial medical examination on 18 January 2018, Dr Liu had noted that the Plaintiff did not suffer any loss of consciousness, amnesia, vomiting or giddiness. Nevertheless, it was recorded in Dr Liu’s medical report that the Plaintiff had impacted his head during the accident and suffered a frontal scalp laceration. It is not implausible that the Plaintiff had only begun experiencing headaches and post-concussion syndrome (as diagnosed by Dr Goh) sometime after the accident. As the Defendants elected not to cross-examine the medical experts on this point, nothing further can be gleaned from the evidence as to the likelihood of this. Dr Goh’s specialist medical report does not record when the Plaintiff began experiencing his stated symptoms. On the face of things, there is simply insufficient evidence to show that the findings by Dr Liu and Dr Goh are necessarily inconsistent.

> (b)     Insofar as the Defendants suggest that the Plaintiff was malingering for the purposes of Dr Goh’s examination but not Dr Lee’s, I am not convinced. Whilst I do not rule out such a possibility, the fact of the matter is that during his examination, Dr Goh _also_ observed the Plaintiff to be “fully alert and rational” as well as “conscious and responsive”. There was no apparent inconsistency in the Plaintiff’s behaviour during the two examinations on the same day. Having made the aforesaid observations, Dr Goh nevertheless arrived at the assessment mentioned above based on the evidence available (which included the Plaintiff’s earlier medical reports and his ongoing complaints of having persistent headaches and giddiness).

> (c)     As mentioned, Dr Lee had similarly observed the Plaintiff to be alert, coherent and rational during the clinical examination. However, beyond finding that the “examination of the head…was unremarkable” and that the “cranial nerves were intact”, Dr Lee did not make any specific assessment of the Plaintiff’s alleged neurological issues. His report does not record any questions being asked (or any complaints being made) in relation to the Plaintiff’s alleged symptoms of having persistent headaches and giddiness. It thus appears that Dr Lee simply did not give an opinion either way as to the existence of such residual neurological problems. This is perhaps unsurprising given that Dr Lee’s specialisation is in orthopaedics. In contrast, Dr Goh’s specialisation is in neurology and his specialist medical report focussed specifically on the “brain and neurological injuries” suffered by the Plaintiff. Insofar as the Plaintiff’s head injury is concerned, I therefore give greater weight to Dr Goh’s assessment.

24     Applying the Guidelines, I find that the Plaintiff’s mild head injury falls at the lower end of the range indicated in Chapter 1(A) for minor brain damage (S$8,000 to S$25,000). Dr Goh had found that “\[a\]lthough there are no major complications from this \[head\] injury, \[the Plaintiff\] is still disabled by the chronic pain and associated symptoms” and “will continue to require treatment, including pain medication until his symptoms improve”. Dr Goh continued by saying that as a result, the Plaintiff will no longer be able to perform heavy manual work as a construction worker. I thus accept that the Plaintiff does continue to suffer from persisting headaches and pain because of his head injury, although it is uncertain how severe these symptoms are and whether they are permanent. There was also a diagnosis that the Plaintiff’s mild head injury led to post-concussion syndrome. That being said, the medical reports do not diagnose any additional problems (such as poor memory, disinhibition of mood or a risk of epilepsy) which might increase the severity of the head injury. Taking everything in to account, I think that an award of S$9,000 would be fair.

25     Second, as regards the 4cm frontal scalp laceration, this had to be treated by suturing. I do not think it is strictly necessary to assess damages for this together with the Plaintiff’s mild head injury since the pain caused by the laceration in breaking the skin would have been experienced somewhat differentially from the Plaintiff’s subsequent headaches and post-concussion syndrome. The range indicated in Chapter 1(G)(f) of the Guidelines for facial lacerations is S$2,500 to S$5,000. Given that this was not a serious injury, however, I find that an award of S$1,000 would be appropriate.

##### (3)   Back contusion with stenosis

26     The Plaintiff claims S$10,000 for a contusion of the lumbar spine with bilateral mild neural foraminal stenosis. This would place his back injuries at the highest end of the range (between S$2,000 and S$10,000) in Chapter 3(B)(c)(i) of the Guidelines for minor back injuries with full recovery taking between two years to five years. The Defendants, on the other hand, submit that a global award of S$500 would be reasonable.

27     I note that no back injuries were recorded in Dr Liu’s medical report in relation to the Plaintiff’s initial medical examination on 18 January 2018. Subsequently, when the Plaintiff was examined at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on 23 February 2018, he complained of low back pain. An X-ray was then conducted with the following findings: (a) “a linear opacity at the right neck \[which\] could be related to extrinsic artefacts; and (b) “loss of the cervical lordosis”.

28     Afterwards, when the Plaintiff was examined by Dr Lee on 2 March 2018, various other medical issues were found upon conducting a physical examination, X-ray and MRI scan. The said issues included: (a) paravertebral muscle spasm and tenderness at the lower lumbar spine upon examination; (b) restricted range of lumbar spine movement in most directions except for lateral rotations; (c) mild curvature of the lumbar spine with convexity to the left; (d) small degenerative endplate osteophytes formation; (e) mild lumbar spondylosis with mild posterior disc bulges; (f) more apparent disc desiccation in the L5-S1 disc; and (g) bilateral mild neural foraminal stenosis at the L5-S1 level.

29     Notwithstanding the diagnosis of these numerous back-related issues, however, it is important to note that ultimately, Dr Lee only concluded that the Plaintiff had suffered from a contusion of the “lumbar spine with bilateral mild neural foraminal stenosis at L5/S1…_as a result of the road traffic accident_…which were managed conservatively” (emphasis added). Beyond this conclusion, Dr Lee’s specialist medical report does not state whether the Plaintiff’s other back-related issues were caused by or related to the accident. It also does not mention _if or how_ the contusion to the Plaintiff’s lumbar spine and bilateral mild neural foraminal stenosis (which were caused by the accident) contributes, aggravates, or is otherwise related to the other back-related issues observed. That being the case, I proceed on the basis that the Plaintiff only sustained a contusion of the lumbar spine with bilateral mild neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 as a result of the accident.

30     As mentioned at \[15\] above, Dr Lee’s specialist medical report also records the Plaintiff’s complaints of difficulties with his daily living activities. However, the medical reports did not substantiate the existence of such major disabilities and the Plaintiff’s own closing submissions did not cite or seek to rely on such supposed difficulties either. I nevertheless take into account Dr Lee’s opinion that together with his other disabilities, the residual pain and stiffness in the Plaintiff’s lower back will make it difficult for him to meet the demands of his pre-accident job as a construction worker.

31     Considering all the circumstances, I find that the Plaintiff’s back injuries fall in the upper half of the range (S$2,000 to S$10,000) indicated for minor back injuries in Chapter 3(B)(c)(i) of the Guidelines. As pointed out by the Defendants, the medical reports do not show that there is an increased vulnerability to future trauma due to a weakened lumbar spine, which might justify a higher award. The timeframe for full recovery (if possible) is also unclear. Based on Dr Lee’s assessment set out at \[29\] above and the residual pain and stiffness in the Plaintiff’s lower back, an award of S$7,000 is reasonable.

##### (4)   Right shoulder abrasion and contusion

32     The Plaintiff suffered a right shoulder abrasion and contusion. He claims damages of S$1,500 whilst the Defendants submit that S$500 would be sufficient. In my view, an award of S$600 would be appropriate. As the Defendants highlight, the medical reports do not mention the extent or severity of the abrasion and contusion. There is therefore insufficient evidence to justify an award in the higher end of the range (between $500 and $1,500) in Chapter 8(C) of the Guidelines for multiple contusions.

##### (5)   Chest contusion

33     The Plaintiff suffered a contusion on his chest. He submits that S$1,000 would be appropriate, whereas the Defendants propose S$500 on the basis that the injury was trivial. I am inclined to accept the Plaintiff’s submitted figure as it is in line with Chapter 6(A)(c)(iii) of the Guidelines, which indicates an award of S$1,000 for a contusion to the chest. As pointed out by the Plaintiff, even at the physical examination on 2 March 2018, Dr Lee noted that “\[t\]enderness was palpated over the sternum and chest wall” upon physical examination. That being the case, I do not think that the contusion was so trivial that a substantial reduction is warranted. I therefore award S$1,000 for the chest contusion.

##### (6)   Multiple scars

34     The Plaintiff claims S$5,000 for the following scars: (a) 3cm by 1cm abrasion scar over the posterior right shoulder; and (b) a healed curvilinear scar, approximately 3cm in length, in the right paramedian location of the vertex of the scalp. The Defendants submit that a global award of S$1,000 is fair.

35     Chapter 8(A) of the Guidelines provide for a range of S$1,500 to S$3,000 for minor scars, and a range of S$5,000 to S$15,000 for multiple scars. I agree with the Defendants that the Plaintiff’s scars are not extensive and are located in less conspicuous regions on the body (being the vertex and right shoulder). In the circumstances, S$1,500 would be a just and reasonable award.

#### Stage 2: Applying the global method

36     At the second stage of the analysis, the global method is applied to ensure that the overall award is reasonable and neither excessive nor inadequate.

37     In applying the component method at the first stage, I have already accounted for any overlapping between injuries (_ie_, the multiple pelvis fractures). I have also referred to the relevant assessment guidelines and precedents, where appropriate. I do not think that there is any further overlapping to be adjusted for at this second stage. In my judgment, the total award of S$31,600 is fair and reasonable compensation for the Plaintiff’s pain and suffering. This is bearing in mind that the plaintiff’s main injuries comprise pelvis fractures, a back contusion with stenosis, as well as a mild head injury with post-concussion syndrome. Together, these injuries have led to some residual disabilities, albeit not major ones.

### Loss of Future Earnings

#### Applicable legal principles in determining LFE

38     As observed by the Court of Appeal in _Samuel Chai_ at \[27\]-\[29\], “the overarching objective of awarding damages \[in tort\] is to compensate the injured victim by restoring him or her to the position that he or she would have been (in a monetary sense) had the accident not happened”. In _Poh Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 1003</span> (“**_Poh Huat Heng_**”) at \[46\], the Court of Appeal further explained the court’s task in making an award for LFE in the following terms:

> … the task of the court in assessing damages in personal injury cases is to arrive at a lump sum which represents as nearly as possible full compensation for the injuries which the plaintiff has suffered. **This means that an award for loss of future income should, as far as reasonably possible, provide the plaintiff with the income that he would have earned but for the accident which caused his injuries** …

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

39     It follows that _at a conceptual level_, an award for LFE is meant to represent any drop from (a) the plaintiff’s future earnings _had the accident not occurred_ to (b) the plaintiff’s future earnings _now that the accident has occurred._ To my mind, this is the proper conceptual formulation for assessing LFE, which may be distilled from the case law albeit that it does not appear to have previously been stated in these exact terms.

40     Practically speaking, the ‘basic method’ of calculating LFE usually involves taking the drop in earnings from the plaintiff’s (higher) pre-accident income to his (lower) post-accident income (see the Blue Book at para 4-4). Hence, it was generally observed in _Samuel Chai_ (at \[20\]) that “loss of future earnings compensates for the difference between the \[plaintiff’s\] post-accident and pre-accident income or rate of income”.

41     It should be noted, however, that while the difference between (a) and (b) at \[39\] above may often correspond to the difference between the plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident income, that is not always the case. In particular, the basic method assumes that the plaintiff’s (higher) pre-accident income may be used as a fair proxy for the plaintiff’s future earnings had the accident not occurred, but this is not necessarily true in all situations:

> (a)     For example, it is well-established that in cases involving a young, injured plaintiff with no pre-accident income, the basic method may be inappropriate because it is premised on the victim already being in employment at the time of the accident (see _Lee Wei Kong (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 85</span> (“**_Lee Wei Kong_**”) at \[29\]-\[33\] generally). With a young plaintiff that has no pre-accident income, a strict application of the basic method would fail to properly compensate for any loss in future earnings caused by the injuries. Hence, in _Lee Wei Kong_ (at \[39\]-42\]), where the young plaintiff was not yet working at the time of the accident, the Court of Appeal opted to _directly_ assess: (a) the plaintiff’s future earnings _had the accident not occurred_ using the starting salary figures of a university graduate (on the basis that the plaintiff would likely have obtained a university degree); and (b) the plaintiff’s future earnings _now that the accident has occurred_ (based on the income he would earn working as an artist or painter after the accident).

> (b)     In a similar vein, the Court of Appeal in _Samuel Chai_ has cautioned against a simplistic comparison of the plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident income when making an award for LFE. On the facts of that case, the plaintiff was remunerated as a physiotherapist at an hourly rate. At \[27\]-\[30\], the Court of Appeal rejected the defendant’s argument that the plaintiff had suffered no loss just because her earnings in absolute figures post-accident were the same or slightly more than what she used to earn pre-accident. The loss caused had to take into account the fact that the plaintiff was no longer able to work the same number of hours as before the accident. The award for LFE was therefore calculated based on the _decrease in the number of hours_ the plaintiff was able to work due to the accident multiplied by the hourly rate that the plaintiff was earning after the accident. In my view, it cannot be gainsaid that this calculation more accurately represented the difference between the plaintiff’s future earnings had the accident not occurred and the plaintiff’s future earnings now that the accident had occurred.

42     It can therefore be seen that in appropriate cases, the court may depart and has departed from the basic method in order to more accurately determine the reduction from the plaintiff’s future earnings _had the accident not occurred_ to the plaintiff’s future earnings _now that the accident has occurred._ In my view, in determining an award for LFE, it is useful to begin from the conceptual formulation at \[39\] above before deciding what methodology to apply in calculating LFE. This would afford more clarity to litigants as to exactly _when and why_ the ‘basic method’ for calculating LFE is inappropriate (_ie_, because it would not accurately represent the difference in \[39\] above).

#### Whether an award for LFE should be made in the present case

43     Turning to the present facts, the Plaintiff claims that he is entitled to S$40,680 for LFE. At the time of the accident in January 2018, he was 35 years old. He is now 39 years old as at the date of the assessment hearing in March 2022. His case is summarised as follows.

44     In respect of the multiplier, the Plaintiff says that he has been working in Singapore since April 2012. Given that he was a skilled worker, he “could have stayed in Singapore for up to 26 years or until 60 years of age”. The retirement age in Bangladesh is similarly 60 years old. The Plaintiff says that since he was 35 years old at the time of the accident, he could have worked “another 20 to 25 years” as a construction worker in either Singapore or Bangladesh had the accident not occurred. Taking into account the contingencies of life as well as a discount for the accelerated receipt, the Plaintiff submits that:

> (a)     in respect of his remaining working years in Singapore, a multiplier of 4 years should be applied; and

> (b)     in respect of his remaining working years in Bangladesh, a multiplier of 7 years should be applied.

45     As for the multiplicand, the Plaintiff’s evidence is as follows:

> (a)     Prior to the accident, he was earning S$900/month as a construction worker in Singapore. If he had not been injured, he could continue to earn that rate of income here.

> (b)     Furthermore, once he returned to Bangladesh, he would still have been able to earn 12,000-15,000 Takas/month working as a construction supervisor or foreman if he had not been injured. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“**AEIC**”) dated 11 October 2020, the Plaintiff said that this was equivalent to S$200-S$250/month, whilst in submissions, his counsel equated this to S$190-S$240/month. The Plaintiff eventually used the figure of S$240/month for the purposes of calculation.

> (c)     According to the Plaintiff’s AEIC, following the accident in January 2018, he returned home to Bangladesh on 5 March 2018. He recuperated for 5 to 6 months before he began working in odd jobs earning about 7,000-8,000 Takas/month (about S$100-S$120/month). As he recovered his strength, he was able to do more varied work earning 8,000-10,000 Takas/month (about S$120-S$140/month). He said that he worked as “a manual worker in the farms or in the city where work is needed” and that his earnings fluctuated “according to the seasonal harvests or as and when people…need help”. At the assessment hearing on 28 March 2022, the Plaintiff testified that he had since begun working as a security guard at a fish farm for 10,000-12,000 Takas/month (about S$158-S$190/month). He settled on the figure of $190/month as the income that he would earn in Bangladesh given his present condition.

> (d)     In light of the above, the Plaintiff submits that:

>> (i)       The multiplicand for his remaining working years in Singapore should be S$710/month (being S$900/month less S$190/month).

>> (ii)       The multiplicand for his remaining working years in Bangladesh should be S$50/month (being S$240/month less S$190/month).

46     In submissions, the Plaintiff’s counsel summarised his final calculations for LFE as follows:

47     Having reviewed the evidence, I am satisfied that the Plaintiff has indeed suffered a loss of future earnings. It is clear that as a result of the accident, he is no longer able to continue his higher-paying pre-accident job in Singapore and is now earning much less in Bangladesh.

48     The Defendants’ sole objection here is that the Plaintiff has not adduced any documentary evidence to substantiate his post-accident income, as set out at \[45(c)\] above. It is therefore argued that the court cannot properly calculate the difference between the Plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident income, such that no award for LFE should be made.

49     In my view, it would certainly be ideal for documentary evidence to be adduced to support the Plaintiff’s actual post-accident income figures. Nevertheless, the lack of supporting documents does not in itself mean that the Plaintiff’s post-accident income figures must therefore be rejected. In the Plaintiff’s AEIC (dated 11 October 2020), his evidence on this area was as follows:

> 32.    Back in Bangladesh, the construction industry is not as sophisticated as those in Singapore. In fact, the industry back home is almost non-existent and construction work in dangerous. The bulk of the workers are farmers or factory workers. They are typically paid 8,000-10,000 Takas (S$128-S$140) monthly. Given my background work experience, I could have returned back home to Bangladesh to work and earn about 12,000 to 15,000 Takas (S$200- S$250) as a construction supervisor or foreman.

> 33.     **At present, I am working as a manual worker in the farms or in the city where work is needed. I cannot return to construction work as I am not as able as I was from before the Accident. My earnings fluctuate according to the seasonal harvests or as and when people or fellow village\[r\]s need help. I earn about 8,000 to 10,000 Takas (S$128 - S$140) per months.**

> …

> 41    After the Accident, I was put on medical leave. I was on hospitalization leave from 18 January 2018 to 25 February 2018 and then from 23 February 2018 to 6 April 2018. **I returned back to Bangladesh in 5 March 2018. I could no longer work as a construction worker. I had to be repatriated.** Enclosed herewith and marked as ‘IMR-10’ are copies of my Medical Certificates and appointment cards from NTFGH.

> 42    I was paid MC wages but I am unable to recall the exact sum. This ought to be reduced from my claim for pre-trial loss of earnings. **Back in Bangladesh. I did not immedicately \[****_sic_****\] resume work. I recuperated for about 5-6 months before starting to work in odd jobs. I earned about 7,000 Takas to 8,000 Takas (S$100 - S$120). As I recovered my strength, I was able to do more varied work earning 8,000 Taka to 10,000 Taka (S$120 to S$140).**

> \[emphasis in bold added\]

50     At the assessment hearing on 28 March 2022, the Plaintiff testified that he had since taken up a job as a security guard at a fish farm for 10,000-12,000 Takas/month. When asked in cross-examination if he had provided any documentary evidence to support his post-accident income figures, the Plaintiff conceded that he had not:

> Q:    In your affidavit, you said you earned S$140/month in Bangladesh. Where can I find the evidence for this in your affidavit?

> A:    No documents or paper to submit. But I can explain about my job scope. Basically my job is to look after fish farm. And I earn about 10-12,000 Bangladeshi takka.

> Q:    Can you elaborate further on what you do at the fish farm?

> A:    I take care of the pond at the fish farm.

> Q:    Does it involve changing the water?

> A:    My job is security guard.

51     In re-examination, the Plaintiff gave the following explanation for the lack of documentary evidence:

> Q:    Just now you said you were earning S$140/month in Bangladesh, currently working in a fish farm, but that you have no supporting documents to submit. Can you explain why you have no documents to adduce in support of your earnings?

> A:    In Bangladesh, this kind of job, there is no appointment letter, there are no documents provided.

52     I am prepared to accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that since returning to Bangladesh, he has been working as an odd job worker. Prior to the accident, the Plaintiff was a construction worker. As a result of his injuries and residual disabilities, he is now unable to continue with that occupation. Both specialist doctors, Dr Lee and Dr Goh, have confirmed this. Parties did not suggest that the Plaintiff has any other specific skillsets which might enable him to find other forms of stable employment. That being the case, it is perhaps unsurprising that the Plaintiff is now limited to doing whatever menial or low skilled jobs might come his way. As seen above, the Plaintiff’s evidence was that after he returned to Bangladesh, he worked as a manual labourer in the farms or in the city, with his earnings fluctuating “according to the seasonal harvests or as and when people or fellow village\[r\]s need help”. Odd job work often only arises on an ad-hoc basis and the pay for such work is not likely to be significant. In my view, it is entirely plausible given the nature of such odd job work that no formal documentation (such as letters of appointments, salary slips or cheques) would be issued. To that extent, I do not think that the Plaintiff ought to be faulted for not being able to produce such documents in support of his post-accident income.

53     Moreover, I do not find the Plaintiff’s post-accident income figures to be unreasonable or otherwise implausible. The Plaintiff’s evidence, on the face of things, is believable. In this regard, I note that during the assessment hearing, the Plaintiff readily mentioned that subsequent to filing his AEIC (dated 11 October 2020), he had taken up a new job as a security guard at a fish farm for which he earned a slightly higher monthly income.

54     Importantly, beyond getting the Plaintiff to concede that he had no supporting documents, the Defendants’ counsel did not question or otherwise challenge the Plaintiff’s evidence on his post-accident work and income. There was no suggestion _at all_ that the Plaintiff was not in fact earning the income or engaged in the work that he said he was. Indeed, as I observe at \[142\]-\[143\] below, even the Defendants’ own submissions on the Plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial loss of earnings appear to accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that when he first started doing odd jobs in Bangladesh, he initially earned 7,000 to 8,000 Takas/month. Whether or not this was part of the Defendants’ litigation strategy, the fact of the matter is that their counsel did not even put to the Plaintiff that his testimony of his post-accident employment and income was untrue. The only point that was made in cross-examination was that the Plaintiff had no documentary evidence in support. Given my preceding comments above, however, I am not persuaded that the Plaintiff should be disbelieved solely on this account.

55     Ultimately, whilst the Plaintiff’s evidence would ideally be supported by documentary evidence, I am satisfied based on his affidavit evidence and his testimony that he will suffer a real assessable loss of earnings because of the accident. The assessment of damages will have to proceed as best as can be done.

56     I thus deal with the specific calculations for LFE. As noted earlier, at a conceptual level, an award for LFE ought to represent the drop from (a) the plaintiff’s future earnings had the accident not occurred to (b) the plaintiff’s future earnings now that the accident has occurred.

57     In applying the multiplier-multiplicand method, I follow the approach taken by the High Court in _Tan Woei Jinn v Thapjang Amorthap and another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 2 SLR(R) 553</span>. In that case, the High Court noted that the plaintiff was a foreign worker who might not have spent all of his remaining working life in Singapore even if the accident had not occurred. As such, the multiplier was split between the plaintiff’s projected remaining working life in Singapore and in his home country. A different multiplicand was applied to each multiplier period as the plaintiff’s earning levels would be different in each country.

58     Given my earlier discussion, the only figures which this court can go on are those given by the Plaintiff. Unfortunately, however, I found the submissions of the Plaintiff’s counsel in this regard to be unsatisfactory for several reasons:

> (a)     First, different exchange rates for converting Bangladeshi Takas to Singapore dollars were used by the Plaintiff at various points without any notice or accompanying explanation (see, for example, \[45(b)-(c)\] above).

> (b)     Second, the submissions by the Plaintiff’s counsel on the proposed multiplier were erroneous (see \[44\] above). Counsel suggested that the Plaintiff could have worked 20-25 years more as a construction worker in Singapore if not for the accident, but this was based on the Plaintiff being 35 years old _at the time of the accident_ in 2018 and working until the retirement age of 60 years old. It is clear, however, that a claim for LFE only concerns the period from the date of assessment (28 March 2022) _onwards_. The Plaintiff was 39 years old at the time of assessment. As such, for the purposes of determining the multiplier, the starting point would be that, if not for the accident, the Plaintiff could work for at most _21 more years_ until the retirement age of 60 years old. Any claim for loss of earnings between the date of the accident (18 January 2018) and the date of assessment (28 March 2022) should be (and is in fact) the subject of the Plaintiff’s separate claim for _pre-trial loss of earnings_.

> (c)     Third, in the Plaintiff’s submissions, counsel proposed a multiplier of 7 years for his remaining working years in Bangladesh. Yet, in the final calculations, counsel inexplicably went on to use a multiplier of 11 years instead (see \[44(b)\] and \[46\] above).

59     These errors were unnecessarily confusing and hindered the court’s task of assessing damages. Nevertheless, they do not ultimately prevent me from determining the Plaintiff’s LFE. In the interest of consistency, I will uniformly apply an exchange rate of 1 Taka: 0.016 SGD in my calculations, which I think is fair. This falls approximately in the middle of the various exchange rates put forth by the Plaintiff. The Defendants did not propose the appropriate exchange rate to be applied.

60     In respect of the multiplier, I note that the Plaintiff is 39 years old as at the date of the assessment hearing. The Defendants do not challenge the Plaintiff’s submission that the retirement age in Singapore and Bangladesh is 60 years. The starting point is therefore that, if not for the accident, the Plaintiff could have at most worked up to 21 more years. Taking all the circumstances into account, I think that a multiplier of 11 years is appropriate, apportioned in the following manner: 3 years for the Plaintiff’s remaining working life in Singapore and 8 years for his remaining working life in Bangladesh. This factors in a discount for accelerated receipt of a lump sum award, and also accounts for the vicissitudes of life – in particular, the vicissitudes of working life for a foreigner who needs a work permit to work in the construction industry in Singapore and who has to compete for jobs with younger foreign workers. This is in line with the multipliers used in comparable cases – see, for example, _Liu Haixiang v China Construction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 21</span> (“**_Liu Haixiang_**”) at \[31\], and _Lai Wai Keong Eugene v Loo Wei Yen_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 1113</span> at \[79\]-\[82\].

61     For completeness, I have not used the _Actuarial Tables with Explanatory Notes for use in Personal Injury and Death Claims_ (Academy Publishing of the Singapore Academy of Law, 2021) (“**Actuarial Tables**”) to determine the multiplier as I do not find it appropriate to do so. As explained in footnote 1 of the Explanatory Notes, the Actuarial Tables are based on population data for Singapore residents and are therefore not suitable to be used in relation to non-Singaporean residents (such as the foreign Plaintiff in this case).

62     Turning to the multiplicand, I first consider what the Plaintiff will be able to earn in Bangladesh in his present condition now that the accident has occurred. In line with my earlier views, I am prepared to accept that the Plaintiff will be able to earn only about 12,000 Takas/month in Bangladesh. This is the highest end of the range of monthly incomes that the Plaintiff says he has earned since working in Bangladesh after the accident. At an exchange rate of 1 Taka: 0.016 SGD, this is equivalent to S$192/month.

63     The next step is to assess the plaintiff’s future earnings had the accident not occurred_._ In relation to the Plaintiff’s remaining working life in Singapore, it is not disputed that prior to the accident, the Plaintiff earned S$900/month as a construction worker in Singapore. I am satisfied that this pre-accident rate of income is a fair proxy for what the Plaintiff _would have_ continued to earn in Singapore if not for the accident. Indeed, neither party has given me any reason to think that the Plaintiff’s earnings would have dropped.

64     As for the Plaintiff’s remaining working life in Bangladesh, he contends that if not for the accident, he could earn 12,000-15,000 Takas/month working in Bangladesh as a construction supervisor or foreman. Unfortunately, parties did not provide any statistical evidence in respect of the average income of such occupations in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, as the Plaintiff’s evidence in this regard was not challenged by the Defendants’ counsel, and the Plaintiff’s figures also do not appear to be unreasonable, I will use the figure of 13,500 Takas/month (equivalent to S$216/month).

65     I therefore award S$27,792 for LFE, calculated as follows:

66     As observed in _Teo Sing Keng and another v Sim Ban Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 340</span> (“**_Teo Sing Keng_**”) at \[21\]-\[22\], \[34\] and \[42\]-\[43\], since an award for LFE is meant to compensate for the loss of a taxable income, a deduction for income tax should in-principle be made. In the present case, however, the Defendants did not submit that any such deduction should be made, nor did they suggest the appropriate percentage to be deducted. I therefore decline to make any such deduction.

### Loss of Earning Capacity

#### Parties’ cases

67     Relying on the Court of Appeal decision in _Lua Bee Kiang_, the Plaintiff submits that in assessing LEC, the _sole requirement_ to be met is whether he has been prevented from competing in the open labour market for his pre-accident job. According to the Plaintiff, this requirement has been satisfied since the medical evidence clearly shows that he is now disadvantaged in and prevented from competing in the open labour market for construction workers. He thus seeks $20,000 for LEC. This is in addition to the claim for LFE.

68     On the other hand, the Defendants argue that to be entitled to an award for LEC, the Plaintiff must meet two requirements: (a) first, that there is a substantial or real risk that he could lose his _current post-accident job_; and (b) second, that he will be at a disadvantage in the open labour market because of his injuries. The Court of Appeal’s decision in _Samuel Chai_ was cited as authority for the applicable legal test. It is said that since there are “no updated medical reports showing that the Plaintiff is unable to work as a security guard and/or would not be able \[to\] continue his occupation as a construction worker eventually”, no award for LEC should be made.

69     As can be seen, it is common ground between parties that to claim for LEC, the plaintiff must show that he will be at a competitive disadvantage in the open labour market because of his injuries. It is, however, in dispute whether the Plaintiff must first establish that he is at a real risk of losing his current post-accident employment in Bangladesh.

#### The applicable legal test to be met

70     To decide this issue, I begin with an analysis of the authorities that undergird parties’ arguments – namely, _Samuel Chai_ and _Lua Bee Kiang_. In _Samuel Chai_ at \[36\], the Court of Appeal held that where the plaintiff is “currently employed” at the time of trial or the assessment hearing, a cumulative two-stage test is to be applied in deciding whether to award LEC:

> (a)     First, there must be “a substantial or real risk that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life”.

> (b)     Second, the plaintiff “will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market”.

71     It is the applicability of the first requirement above which is in dispute. For ease of reference, I refer to this as the _“risk of loss of employment” requirement._ To determine whether this requirement is applicable on the present facts, it is imperative to first understand its underlying rationale.

72     In laying down its two-stage test for LEC, the Court of Appeal in _Samuel Chai_ had affirmed the general legal principles set out by the English Court of Appeal in _Moeliker v A Reyrolle and Co Ltd_ \[1977\] 1 All ER 9 (“**_Moeliker_**”) at 17. The relevant passage is reproduced below:

> 36     **Both the AR and the Judge seemed to take the view that loss of earning capacity could be awarded even if there was no risk that the injured victim might lose his or her current post-accident job**. Such an award could be granted so long as the injured victim would be disadvantaged in finding a similar paying job because of the injuries and resulting disabilities. **This approach would appear to run contrary to the principles discussed above and adopted in** **_Teo Sing Keng_** (\[16\] _supra_). **It is trite that an award for loss of earning capacity (in the context where the plaintiff is currently employed) can only be awarded** **_if there is a substantial or real risk_** **that the plaintiff could lose his or her present job at some time before the estimated end of his or her working life and that the plaintiff will, because of the injuries, be at a disadvantage in the open employment market**. It is a cumulative test. I**n** **_Moeliker_**, Brown LJ stated (at 17):

>> I do not think one can say more by way of principle than this. The consideration of this head of damages should be made in two stages. **1\. Is there a ‘substantial’ or ‘real’ risk that a plaintiff will lose his present job at some time before the estimated end of his working life? 2. If there is (****_but not otherwise_****), the court must assess and quantify the present value of the risk of the financial damage which the plaintiff will suffer if that risk materialises**, having regard to the degree of the risk, the time when it may materialise, and the factors, both favourable and unfavourable, which in a particular case will, or may, affect the plaintiff’s chances of getting a job at all, or an equally well paid job.

>> \[emphasis added\]

> Following from this, no award for loss of earning capacity should be granted if there is no risk of the Respondent’s post-accident employment being terminated.

> \[emphasis in italics original; emphasis in bold added\]

73     Conceptually speaking, an award for LEC is meant to compensate an injured plaintiff for the weakening of his competitive position in the open labour market caused by his injuries. The court should assess LEC “in the round”, taking into account all relevant factors that may affect the plaintiff’s chances of obtaining employment, including “the plaintiff’s age, his skills, the nature of his disability, whether he is capable of undertaking only one type of work or whether he is capable of undertaking other types of work as well” (_Mykytowych, Pamela Jane v V I P Hotel_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 829</span> (“**_Mykytowych_**_”_) at \[141\]). As observed in _Moeliker_ at 16-17, in awarding LEC, the court is essentially assessing and quantifying the present value of _the risk of financial damage_ which the plaintiff will suffer at some point in future because of his competitive disadvantage in the labour market.

74     It is apparent, however, that even if a plaintiff will suffer some sort of competitive disadvantage due to his injuries, that disadvantage will only come into play insofar as the plaintiff has to seek employment in the open labour market in future. In this vein, it is apposite to refer to _Smith v Manchester Corp_ (1974) 17 KIR 1 (“**_Smith_**”), where the English Court of Appeal helpfully explained the concept of LEC as follows:

> **The second element in this type of loss is the weakening of the plaintiff’s competitive position in the open labour market \[** **_ie_**, **loss of earning capacity\]: that is to say, should the plaintiff lose her current employment, what are her chances of obtaining comparable employment in the open labour market?** The evidence here is plain – that, in the event (which one hopes will never materialise) of her losing her employment with Manchester Corporation she, with a stiff shoulder and a disabled right arm, is going to have to compete in the domestic labour market with women who are physically fully able. **This represents a serious weakening of her competitive position in the one market into which she can go to obtain employment. It is for that reason that it is quite wrong to describe this weakness as a ‘possible’ loss of earning capacity: it is an existing loss: she is already weakened to that extent, though fortunately** **she is protected for the time being against suffering any financial damage because she does not, at present, have to go into the labour market****.**

> \[emphasis added in bold and bold underline\]

75     The above passage was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in _Chang Ah Lek and others v Lim Ah Koon_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 551</span> (“**_Chang Ah Lek_**”) at \[26\]. As observed in _Smith_, even if a plaintiff has been weakened competitively because of his injuries, no consequent financial damage may actually materialise so long as the plaintiff does not go or have to go into the open labour market. In other words, it is only insofar that a plaintiff will seek or have to seek employment in the open labour market in future that any competitive disadvantage suffered may occasion financial damage to him.

76     To my mind, this explains the “risk of loss of employment” requirement in _Samuel Chai_. Where the plaintiff is “currently employed” at the time of the trial/assessment, he must show a ‘substantial or real risk’ of loss of employment _so as to establish_ that he may actually have to seek employment in the open labour market in future. Only then would any weakening of his competitive position in that market occasion financial damage to him. This same idea is reflected in the following remarks in _Moeliker._ In distilling the general legal principles for LEC, which were cited in _Samuel Chai_ (see \[72\] above), the English Court of Appeal in _Moeliker_ stated (at 16):

> …**what has somehow to be quantified in assessing damages \[for LEC\] is the present value of the risk that a plaintiff will, at some future time, suffer** **_financial damage_** **_because of_** **_his disadvantage in the labour market_****. …**

> **Where a plaintiff is in work at the date of the trial**, the first question on this head of damage is**: what is the risk that he will, at some time before the end of his working life**, **_lose that job_** **and** **_be thrown on the labour market_****?** I think the question is whether this is a 'substantial' risk or is it a 'speculative' or 'fanciful' risk. … If…there is no 'substantial' or 'real' risk of the plaintiff's losing his present job in the rest of his working life, no damages will be recoverable under this head.

> But if the court decides that there is a risk which is 'substantial' or 'real', the court has somehow to assess this risk and quantify it in damages. …

> \[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold, bold italics and bold underline\]

The above remarks make clear that the purpose of requiring the plaintiff to show a ‘real risk’ of loss of employment is to establish that the plaintiff may, at some point in future, have to seek employment in the open labour market.

77     Applying this rationalisation to the facts of _Samuel Chai_ itself, the plaintiff there had remained in the same line of work (as a physiotherapist) before and after the accident. As may be recalled from \[41(b)\] above, the plaintiff was already compensated for LFE based on the decrease in the number of hours she was able to work as physiotherapist due to the accident. Applying the two-stage test for LEC it had set out, the Court of Appeal (at \[37\]-\[38\]) also made an award for LEC on the basis that: (a) there was a real risk that the plaintiff could _still_ lose her employment as a physiotherapist in future; and (b) if the plaintiff was “compelled to re-enter the labour market”, her disabilities would put her at some disadvantage in finding commensurate employment. In my view, the requirement that (a) be shown is perfectly sound for the reasons just discussed. If the plaintiff did not have to ever compete in the open labour market again, her weakened competitive position in that market would not cause her any further financial damage.

78     The above rationalisation also sits neatly with the applicable legal test for LEC in cases where the plaintiff is _unemployed_ at the time of trial or the assessment hearing. In _Mykytowych_, the Court of Appeal set out the relevant legal test as follows (at \[139\]):

> … **Where the plaintiff is unemployed at the time of the assessment of damages hearing, the test to be applied** in determining whether to make any award for loss of future earning capacity **is whether there is a real risk that the plaintiff will be at a disadvantage in the open employment market because of the injury sustained in the accident**. _This stands in contrast to the two-stage approach adopted in cases involving a plaintiff who is employed at the time damages are assessed_, _where the court would first ascertain the likelihood of the plaintiff losing his current employment_ before considering the extent of his economic handicap in the open employment market.

> \[emphasis added in bold and italics\]

Where a plaintiff is unemployed at the time of trial or the assessment hearing, there is no risk of him losing his “current employment” that can be shown. The plaintiff is _already_ in the open labour market. Accordingly, the “risk of loss of employment” requirement in _Samuel Chai_ and its underlying rationale (as discussed at \[76\] above) are simply inapplicable. As held in _Mykytowych_, the only requirement for claiming LEC in such a situation is that the plaintiff will be at a competitive disadvantage in the open labour market due to his injuries. If he is, the court may then simply assess the present value of the risk of financial damage that will result.

79     As can be seen, _Samuel Chai_ and _Mykytowych_ involved two different types of fact-patterns, to which different legal tests were applied for the reasons discussed. _Samuel Chai_ applied its two-stage test to a plaintiff who had managed to remain in the same line of work before and after the accident. On the other hand, where the plaintiff was already unemployed at the time of the trial or assessment, the sole requirement in _Mykytowych_ was that the alleged competitive disadvantage be proved.

80     There is yet another, third type of fact-pattern where the plaintiff has lost his better, higher-paying pre-accident job because of his injuries and is compelled to take up a different, lower-paying post-accident job. This type of fact-pattern is exemplified on the facts of _Lua Bee Kiang_, to which I now turn.

81     In _Lua Bee Kiang_, the plaintiff worked as a carpenter prior to the accident. Due to his injuries, however, he could subsequently only find work as a cleaner at a lower pay. In the High Court, the plaintiff claimed for LEC on the basis that the two-stage test in _Samuel Chai_ was satisfied. He submitted that he was still at risk of losing his current post-accident job, and that he would be at a disadvantage in the open labour market because of his injuries. The defendant appeared to challenge only the quantum sought and argued that there was no evidence that the plaintiff would be disadvantaged in getting a job in the open labour market at the same rate of pay. The High Court judge awarded the plaintiff $5,000 for LEC, having accepted that: (a) his injuries continued to affect him at work given the physical nature of his job as a cleaner; and (b) there was a risk that he could still lose his current post-accident job as a cleaner (see _Yeo Chee Siong v Salpac (S) Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 304</span> at \[37\]-\[42\]).

82     On appeal, the defendant’s sole argument against the LEC award was that the plaintiff had failed to show that he was at risk of losing his current _post-accident job_ as a cleaner. At \[50\], the Court of Appeal specifically rejected this argument, reasoning that “\[t\]he question is not whether \[the plaintiff\] is at risk of losing his current, post-accident employment”, but “whether he has been prevented from competing in the market for his _pre-accident job_” (emphasis added). It seems reasonably clear that this was simply a different way of asking whether the plaintiff would be at a ‘competitive disadvantage’ in the open labour market for his pre-accident job. The Court of Appeal went on to hold that since the medical evidence showed that the plaintiff could no longer continue in his pre-accident job, an award for LEC was justified. The relevant passage is reproduced below:

> Issue 2: Loss of earning capacity

> 50    Next, Mdm Lua \[the defendant\] submits that the Judge should not have awarded Mr Yeo \[the plaintiff\] $5,000 for loss of earning capacity because Mr Yeo “has not adduced any evidence to show that he will be at risk of losing his current employment”. In our judgment, this argument is misconceived. **The question is not whether he is at risk of losing his current, post-accident employment, but whether he has been prevented from competing in the market for his pre-accident job.** And there is no doubt on the evidence that he has. The Judge found, and Mdm Lua does not contest the finding, that **Mr Yeo could no longer work as a carpenter after the accident, and now has to work as a cleaner, for which he is paid less** (see the GD at \[34\]). We therefore reject Mdm Lua’s submission.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

83     As can be seen, the Court of Appeal in _Lua Bee Kiang_ did not apply the “risk of loss of employment” requirement set out in _Samuel Chai_. The _sole_ requirement was that the plaintiff had to show that he would be at a competitive disadvantage in respect of his pre-accident job because of his injuries. This is the basis of the Plaintiff’s submission at \[67\] above.

84     In my opinion, the different approach taken in _Lua Bee Kiang_ is perfectly explicable on its particular fact-pattern. As mentioned, the plaintiff in _Lua Bee Kiang_ had lost his higher-paying pre-accident job as a carpenter because of his injuries. By force of circumstance, he had to take up a lower-paying post-accident job as a cleaner. It was clear on the facts of that case that _even if the plaintiff’s post-accident job was entirely secure_, (a) the plaintiff would nevertheless seek to obtain employment in his higher-paying pre-accident line of work if he could; but (b) he was now competitively disadvantaged and prevented from doing so because of his injuries. This would clearly occasion financial damage to him (_ie_, in the way described at \[74\]-\[75\] above).

85     Pertinently, the plaintiff was _not_ protected from the financial damage of being prevented from competing for his higher-paying, pre-accident job _just because_ he continued to hold a lower-paying, post-accident job. The rationale for imposing the “risk of loss of employment” requirement in _Samuel Chai_ at \[76\] above therefore did not apply – the risk of the plaintiff losing his pre-accident job had already materialised; and it was clear that the plaintiff would seek employment in his pre-accident line of work and suffer financial damage because of his disadvantage _anyway_. This was _not_ contingent on him losing his lower-paying post-accident job first.

86     This explains why, on the fact-pattern of _Lua Bee Kiang_, the Court of Appeal focussed on whether the plaintiff had been “prevented from competing in the market for his pre-accident job”, and not “whether he \[was\] at risk of losing his current, post-accident employment”. Since the plaintiff would plainly be at a disadvantage in competing for his pre-accident job and there was a consequent risk of financial damage, an award for LEC was amply justified. The _extent_ of that financial damage was finally assessed by the Court of Appeal on the basis that (a) the plaintiff “could no longer work as a carpenter after the accident”; and (b) he “now has to work as a cleaner, for which he is paid less” (see _Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[50\]). The defendant’s appeal against the LEC award was accordingly dismissed.

87     To distil the relevant legal principles, it is evident that in this third type of fact-pattern in _Lua Bee Kiang_, the plaintiff may claim for LEC in relation to the disadvantage he will suffer in competing for his _pre-accident_ job. The sole requirement is rightly that such a disadvantage must exist. If this is shown, then as was the case in _Lua Bee Kiang_, the extent of the resulting financial damage may be assessed on the basis that: (a) the plaintiff has lost and will now be disadvantaged in competing for his higher-paying pre-accident job; _but_ (b) _he is still able to earn an income in his lower-paying post-accident job_. The latter would essentially form the ‘lower limit’ when assessing the extent of the financial damage which the plaintiff will suffer. That is, the extent of his financial damage would be limited by the fact that he can still earn some income from his lower-paying post-accident job.

88     In _obiter_, I would venture even further to suggest the following. In the aforesaid type of fact-pattern, the plaintiff may well also be able to claim a _further_ loss of earning capacity on the basis that he will also be at a disadvantage in competing for his _post-accident_ job and suffer _further_ financial damage as a result_._ In principle, it is difficult to see why such a plaintiff should not be able to do so. Such a claim would be entirely consistent with the established premise that an award for LEC is meant to compensate an injured plaintiff for the financial damage which he will suffer in future because of any competitive disadvantage caused by his injuries. It is trite that the general aim of tortious damages is to restore the plaintiff to the position that he would have been had the accident not occurred. If the plaintiff’s injuries would cause him _further_ financial damage because of the disadvantage he will suffer in competing for his _post-accident_ job, there is no reason in principle to impose an absolute bar against such claims.

89     Where such a further claim is made by the plaintiff, I take the view that the cumulative two-stage test in _Samuel Chai_ ought to apply. The plaintiff must first show a real risk of losing his post-accident job such that he may have to re-enter the open labour market for such jobs in future. Otherwise, if there is no such risk, he would be protected from any further financial damage. This is consistent with the underlying rationale for the “risk of loss of employment” requirement in _Samuel Chai._ Once the first requirement is met, the plaintiff must then show that he will indeed be at a disadvantage in competing for his post-accident job. Significantly, this also appears to have been the approach taken by the High Court in _Lua Bee Kiang_ (see \[81\] above). As mentioned, the High Court judge had awarded $5,000 for LEC on the basis that: (i) the plaintiff was also at risk of losing his _post-accident_ job as a cleaner; and (ii) his injuries continued to affect his _post-accident_ work (which presumably translated into a competitive disadvantage for such work).

90     If the two-stage test is met, the _extent_ of financial damage caused may then be assessed on the basis that (a) the plaintiff may lose his post-accident job in future and will be disadvantaged in competing for it; and (b) he may then have to take up even lower-paying jobs or be unemployed altogether (whatever the case may be).

91     There is a question, however, of whether such a further claim for LEC has been excluded in principle by the Court of Appeal’s holding in _Lua Bee Kiang_ (at \[50\]). Notably, the Court of Appeal in that case appears to have assessed LEC _only_ on the basis set out at \[87\] above (_ie_, in relation to the plaintiff’s _pre-accident_ job). That is the specific context in which it had rejected the argument that the plaintiff must show a real risk of losing his post-accident job (see \[84\]-\[86\] above).

92     It is not clear to me that the Court of Appeal also meant to rule that the High Court’s basis for assessing LEC in relation to the plaintiff’s _post-accident_ job was inherently wrong in principle (see \[88\]-\[89\] above). To begin with, it was not expressly argued why in principle the plaintiff should not be able to bring a LEC claim on such a basis. Moreover, the plaintiff in _Lua Bee Kiang_ did not specify whether he was claiming LEC in respect of an alleged disadvantage _vis-à-vis_ his pre-accident or post-accident job (see \[81\] above). The Court of Appeal had simply proceeded to assess LEC on the basis that it was meant only to compensate for the financial damage caused by the former. Indeed, it appears that the difference between the two bases of assessment may not have been fully appreciated given that it was not at all discussed even as the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against the High Court’s decision.

93     In the premises, it is my respectful view that the ruling in _Lua Bee Kiang_ (at \[50\]) is limited to the following proposition – that in this third type of fact-pattern, when assessing LEC on the basis at \[87\] above (_ie_, in relation to the plaintiff’s _pre-accident_ job), there is no requirement for the plaintiff to first show a real risk of him losing his post-accident job. _Lua Bee Kiang_ did not go so far as to exclude in principle a further claim for LEC on the basis that the plaintiff will also be at a disadvantage in competing for his _post-accident job_. Where such a further claim is made, I similarly do not think that _Lua Bee Kiang_ excludes the application of the two-stage test in _Samuel Chai._ The Court of Appeal’s views on the matter remain to be seen.

94     In summary, the following legal principles for awarding LEC may be discerned from the key authorities above. There are at least three types of fact-patterns to consider:

> (a)      The first type of fact-pattern involves a plaintiff who remains in the same line of work before and after the accident (and up to the time of the trial/assessment). Following _Samuel Chai_, the cumulative two-stage test is to be applied. The plaintiff must first show a ‘substantial or real risk’ of loss of employment _so as to establish_ that he may actually have to seek employment in the open labour market in future. Only then would any weakening of his competitive position in that market occasion financial damage to him. Thereafter, the plaintiff must prove that he will suffer the alleged competitive disadvantage.

> (b)      The second type of fact-pattern involves a plaintiff who is unemployed at the time of trial or assessment. As held in _Mykytowych_, the only requirement is for the plaintiff to show that he will be at a competitive disadvantage in the open labour market due to his injuries. Since the plaintiff is already unemployed and in the open labour market, there is simply no risk of him losing his “current employment” that can be shown.

> (c)      The third type of fact-pattern is where a plaintiff has lost his better, higher-paying pre-accident job because of his injuries and is compelled to take up a different, lower-paying post-accident job instead. In such a case, the following general principles apply:

>> (i)       Where the plaintiff claims that he will be at a disadvantage in competing for his _higher-paying pre-accident job_ because of his injuries, the sole requirement is that he show that such a disadvantage exists (following _Lua Bee Kiang_). If this is shown, the court will have to assess the extent of the financial damage caused by that disadvantage. There is no requirement that the plaintiff must show a real risk of losing his lower-paying post-accident job before he can be awarded for LEC. This is because _even if_ his post-accident job is secure, the plaintiff may nevertheless suffer financial damage because of his disadvantage in competing for the higher-paying, pre-accident job that he has lost.

>> (ii)       If the plaintiff further claims that he will also be at a disadvantage in competing for his _lower-paying post-accident job_ and that he will suffer _further_ financial damage as a result, I suggest in _obiter_ that the cumulative two-stage test in _Samuel Chai_ ought to apply. Since the plaintiff still holds his post-accident job, he must first show a real risk of losing it so as to establish that he may have to re-enter the open labour market for such jobs in future. Otherwise, if there is no such risk, the plaintiff would be protected from any further financial damage. Thereafter, he must prove that he will suffer the competitive disadvantage alleged.

95     As a final point, I note that the decisions in _Samuel Chai_ and _Lua Bee Kiang_ have also been considered and interpreted by the District Court in _Pawel Gajewski v Lee Tong Lynn_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 153</span> (“**_Pawel_**”) at \[39\]-\[45\]. This District Court judgment was cited by the Plaintiff in support of his position above. In that case, the learned Deputy Registrar had explained the differing legal tests in _Samuel Chai_ and _Lua Bee Kiang_ by distinguishing them on their facts. He observed (at \[44\]-\[45\]) that although the “risk of loss of employment” requirement in _Samuel Chai_ refers to the plaintiff’s “_present job_”, this had to be understood in the relevant context – namely, that the plaintiff in _Samuel Chai_ had remained in the same line of work before and after the accident. As such, for the purposes of articulating the applicable legal test, there was simply no material difference between the plaintiff’s pre-accident and post-accident employment. In contrast, the plaintiff in _Lua Bee Kiang_ had different pre-accident and post-accident jobs. The Deputy Registrar thus observed (at \[46\]) that:

> It therefore appears from the above that different tests apply depending on whether or not the plaintiff has _changed_ his occupation after the accident. If there is _no change_ in occupation, the cumulative test stated in _\[Samuel Chai v\] Linda Shaw_ (see \[43\] above) is the governing approach. **If there is** **_any change_** **in occupation, the sole requirement that has to be met is whether the plaintiff “has been prevented from competing in the market for his** **_pre-accident job_****” (****_Lua Bee Kiang_** **at \[50\]).**

> \[emphasis in italics original; emphasis in bold added\]

96     Whilst I generally do not disagree with _Pawel’s_ characterisation of _Samuel Chai_ and _Lua Bee Kiang_, it will be apparent that the principles I have distilled from the two decisions differ somewhat from the conclusion in _Pawel_. In particular, I would respectfully disagree with the general proposition that if there is any “_change in employment_”, the _sole_ requirement to be met is whether the plaintiff has been prevented from competing in the labour market for his _pre-accident job_ (_Pawel_ at \[46\]).

97     In my respectful view, _Lua Bee Kiang_ ought to be characterised specifically as a case where the plaintiff had lost his better, higher-paying pre-accident job because of his injuries and was compelled to take up a different, lower-paying post-accident job instead. The applicable legal test (and their underlying justifications) would follow the principles summarised at \[94(c)\] above for this third type of fact-pattern. As discussed, these principles ultimately flow from the rationale underlying the “risk of loss of employment” requirement in _Samuel Chai_ (at \[76\] above).

98     Where a plaintiff instead loses a _lower-paying pre-accident job_ and takes up a _different, higher-paying post-accident job_, I would hesitate to say that the sole requirement is for the plaintiff to show that he will be at a competitive disadvantage for his pre-accident job. I express the following brief remarks in _obiter:_

> (a)     If the plaintiff seeks an award for LEC for the disadvantage he will suffer in competing for his _lower-paying pre-accident_ job, there may well be good reasons to require him to first show a real risk of losing his higher-paying post-accident job. This is because the plaintiff may otherwise never have to re-enter the open labour market for his lower-paying pre-accident job. And if he does not do so, any competitive disadvantage he might suffer in that market would not financially damage him anyway.

> (b)     If the plaintiff seeks an award for LEC for the disadvantage he will suffer in competing for his _higher-paying post-accident_ job, it would naturally be necessary for him to first show a real risk of him losing that post-accident employment. Otherwise, he would not re-enter the labour market for such jobs so as to suffer financial damage from his competitive disadvantage.

99      _Pawel_ was subsequently cited with approval in _Muhammad Saifuddin Bin Hannabi v Kok Chee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 212</span> (“**Muhammad Saifuddin**”) at \[44\]-\[51\] and _Mohammad Fadhil Bin Mohammad Anis v Muhammad Faizal Bin Abdullah_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 169</span> (“**Mohammad Fadhil**”) at \[59\]-\[63\]. In my understanding, all three decisions express similar views that where there is a “change in employment”, the court’s point of reference in determining if an award for LEC should be made is the plaintiff’s pre-accident job and _not_ his post-accident job (_Pawel_ at \[45\] and \[48\]; _Muhammad Saifuddin_ at \[50\] and _Mohammad Fadhil_ at \[62\]). However, for the reasons explained in _obiter_ at \[88\]-\[90\] above, I think it may well be possible for a plaintiff to claim LEC for any disadvantage he will suffer in relation to not only his pre-accident job, but also his post-accident job.

100    Bearing in mind the legal principles discussed above, as well as the rationale for the “risk of loss of employment” requirement in _Samuel Chai_, I now turn to examine the present facts.

#### Application to the present facts

101    In my view, the present case falls squarely within the third type of fact-pattern mentioned above. Indeed, the facts here are analogous to those in _Lua Bee Kiang_. The Plaintiff here claims for LEC on the basis that, because of his injuries, he is now at a serious disadvantage in competing in the open labour market for his pre-accident job. He has in fact lost that pre-accident job as a construction worker in Singapore and has had to return home to Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, he is now confined to doing lower-paying odd jobs and whatever menial jobs he can find. At the time of the assessment, he was working as a security guard at a fish farm.

102    Applying the same reasoning in _Lua Bee Kiang_, the sole requirement to be met is that the Plaintiff will be prevented from or otherwise disadvantaged in competing for his pre-accident job. In this regard, both Dr Lee’s and Dr Goh’s specialist medical opinions amply confirm that the Plaintiff’s residual pain and disabilities would make it difficult for him to return to work in the construction industry. Given the nature of his injuries, I find that the plaintiff will indeed be at a competitive disadvantage in the open labour market for his pre-accident job. Indeed, he may not be able to ever secure stable employment in that line of work in future. Nevertheless, he is still able to secure lower-paying work back at home, and the assessment of the _extent_ of financial damage which he will incur because of his disadvantage must therefore take place on this basis.

103    Pertinently, the Plaintiff’s exposure to such financial damage is _not_ contingent on him losing his post-accident employment first. It is clear even if the Plaintiff’s post-accident employment is entirely secure, he would nevertheless seek better-paying work as a construction worker/foreman if he could, except that he is now disadvantaged in doing so because of his injuries. This will cause him financial damage in any case. Accordingly, there is no need for him to first show a real risk of losing his post-accident employment before he is entitled to claim for LEC _vis-à-vis_ his pre-accident job.

104    The Plaintiff has not made the further argument that his injuries will also put him at a disadvantage in competing for his _post-accident_ work doing odd jobs and other menial work. Strictly speaking, it is therefore unnecessary for me to delve into this. Nevertheless, in line with my _obiter_ remarks at \[88\]-\[90\] above, I would refuse any further award for LEC on such a basis. In making such a claim, the Plaintiff will have to show that (a) he is at a real risk of losing his post-accident employment; and (b) he will be at a disadvantage in securing the same or comparable employment. Since the Plaintiff’s post-accident work in odd jobs and other menial work arises on an ad-hoc basis, I am prepared to find that he may well be compelled to re-enter the open labour market for such work in Bangladesh at some point in future. However, it is unclear just how much of a disadvantage he will be at. The fact of the matter is that his injuries have thus far not prevented him from obtaining such work earning him about 12,000 Takas/month. He has not properly explained the nature and the physical demands of the jobs available to him, which appear to vary significantly. Nor has he explained the kind of difficulties or disadvantage he will face, save for his general references to the injuries sustained. In the premises, an award for further loss of earning capacity would not be warranted.

105    Ordinarily, the only remaining step for assessing LEC would be to determine the quantum of the award on the basis set out at \[102\] above. After all, I have found that the Plaintiff _will_ be disadvantaged in competing for his pre-accident job, albeit that he is now still able to do lower-paying odd jobs and other menial work.

106    In my judgment, however, a critical issue of overcompensation now arises if an award for both LFE and LEC is made. It is to this issue that I now turn before reaching a final conclusion on the issue of LEC.

### Distinction between LFE and LEC and the issue of overcompensation

107    There is a question of whether, in light of the award for LFE above, an additional award for LEC would lead to overcompensation. I had directed parties to file further written submissions on this issue of overcompensation and their positions are summarised below:

> (a)     Relying on _Samuel Chai_, the Plaintiff submits that there is “no general rule” which bars a plaintiff from being entitled to claim both LFE and LEC, provided that the necessary evidence is present for each head of claim. He contends that since such evidence is indeed present, both LFE and LEC should therefore be awarded here. He insists that there will not be any overlap on the present facts because _Samuel Chai_ has held that “the two heads of damages are distinct and are meant to compensate different losses”.

> (b)     On the other hand, the Defendants submit that while “both LFE and LEC can be awarded”, the court has to ensure that there will be no overlap between the two heads of damages. An award for LFE would account for any reduction in the Plaintiff’s future earnings caused by him no longer being able to work as a construction worker and now being confined to doing odd jobs. The Defendants argue that to prevent overlapping, the applicable test for LEC should be the cumulative, two-stage test in _Shaw Linda._ Curiously, however, they stop short of explaining just how the application of the said test would prevent overlapping. In any event, I did not change my mind on the applicable test for LEC as previously discussed.

#### General legal principles governing LFE and LEC

108    I begin with the general legal principles governing LFE and LEC. In particular, I consider whether they preclude me from finding that on the specific facts at hand, there is an overlap between the awards for LFE and LEC sought by the Plaintiff.

109    In _Samuel Chai_ (at \[10\], \[12\] and \[20\]), the Court of Appeal explained the true nature of LFE and LEC, and their conceptual relationship, as follows:

> 10    It would be useful if **we address the true nature of loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity. The two heads of damages are not** **strictly** **alternative to each other**, although in an appropriate case, if the plaintiff should fail in his or her claim for loss of future earnings, he or she could nevertheless be awarded damages for loss of earning capacity. **The two heads of damages do not** **necessarily** **share any symbiotic relationship, as they are distinct and are meant to compensate different losses suffered by an injured plaintiff**. …

> …

> 12    … Lord Denning MR pointed out in the later case of _Fairley v John Thompson (Design and Contracting Division) Ltd_ \[1973\] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 40 (“_Fairley_”) that these two heads of damages are indeed separate and distinct. …. \[He\] outlined the differences between these two heads of damages (at 42):

>> It is important to realize that there is a difference between an award for loss of earnings as distinct from compensation for loss of earning capacity. _Compensation for loss of future earnings is awarded for real assessable loss proved by evidence. Compensation for diminution in earning capacity is awarded as part of general damages_. If I may give an instance, a manual worker may be incapacitated for manual work, but after the accident he may learn a clerical trade. At his new trade he may actually earn more than he would have done before. He will have diminished earning capacity, but he has not lost any future earnings. \[emphasis added\]

> 20    …\[I\]n the event that there is a lack of sufficient evidence proving loss of future earnings, this cannot, by itself, convert a claim for loss of future earnings into a claim for loss of earning capacity. **These two heads of damages are meant to compensate for different losses** – _loss of future earnings compensates for the difference between the post-accident and preaccident income or rate of income, while loss of earning capacity compensates for the risk or disadvantage, which the plaintiff would suffer in the event that he or she should lose the job that he or she currently holds, in securing an equivalent job in the open employment market_. Since loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity are separate and distinct, the Appellant’s suggestion that the failure to prove loss of future earnings should lead to an award for loss of earning capacity is conceptually erroneous.

> \[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold and italics\]

110    At \[24\]-\[25\], the Court of Appeal added the following general comment:

> 24     **Finally, there is one other general comment which we would make. There is nothing in principle which bars a plaintiff from being entitled to claim for both loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity, provided that the necessary evidence is present**. In this connection, we would refer to the judgment of Browne LJ in _Moeliker_ where he said (at 15):

>> This court made it clear … that \[_Smith v Manchester_\] laid down no new principle of law, and I entirely agree. \[_Smith v Manchester_\] is merely an example of an award of damages under a head which has long been recognised – a plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity where as a result of his injury his chances in the future of getting in the labour market work (or work as well paid as before the accident) have been diminished by his injury. … This head of damage generally arises where a plaintiff is, at the time of the trial, in employment, but there is a risk that he may lose this employment at some time in the future and may then, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well paid job. It is a different head of damages from an actual loss of future earnings _which can already be proved at the time of the trial_. \[emphasis added\]

> 25    To reiterate again, loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity compensate different losses. We can best illustrate the point by an example. Suppose an injured person was taken back by his pre-accident employer to do a less demanding job due to his disabilities but at a lower pay. If the employer cannot guarantee how long he will be so employed but will do so as long as possible, it seems to us that the injured victim should be entitled to awards based on both heads of damages.

> \[emphasis added in bold and bold underline\]

111    To reiterate, an award for LFE is meant to compensate the plaintiff for “the \[future\] income that he would have earned but for the accident” (_Poh Huat Heng_ at \[46\]). On the other hand, an award for LEC compensates for the financial damage which a plaintiff will incur from being disadvantaged in the open labour market because of his injuries. It is therefore evident that _at a conceptual level_, the two are separate and distinct heads of damages meant to compensate for different losses. Hence, it was generally commented in _Samuel Chai_ (at \[24\]) that “\[t\]here is nothing in principle which bars a plaintiff from being entitled to claim for both \[LFE\] and \[LEC\], provided that the necessary evidence is present”.

112    In the present case, the Plaintiff relies on this general comment to argue that both LFE and LEC can be awarded here so long as the necessary evidence is present. He insists that there is no overlap between the two heads of damages _on the present facts_ simply because _Samuel Chai_ has held that “the two heads of damages are distinct and are meant to compensate different losses”.

113    In my view, however, the Plaintiff’s argument is misconceived. The Court of Appeal’s observations in _Samuel Chai_ must be understood in context. They related generally to the conceptual nature and basis of LFE and LEC. Since the two are conceptually distinct claims, it follows that at a conceptual level, a plaintiff _may_ very well be entitled to claim for both LFE and LEC provided that the necessary evidence is present. That is as far as the Court of Appeal’s general comment goes. As a matter of general principle, there is clearly no absolute bar against this. This is not to say, however, that _in all cases_, a plaintiff is _always_ entitled to claim for both LFE and LEC as long as the necessary evidence is present. That is in effect the thrust of the Plaintiff’s submission, which I think misconstrues the Court of Appeal’s comment.

114    Again, it is trite that at _a conceptual level_, LFE and LEC are distinct heads of damages meant to compensate for different losses. This is not to say, however, that the losses compensated for by each head of damage will _never_ overlap in _any factual situation_. Indeed, I do not interpret _Samuel Chai_ as expressing such a view. There, the Court of Appeal only went so far as to recognise that the two heads of damages are not _strictly_ alternative to each other and do not _necessarily_ share any symbiotic relationship (at \[10\]). The language used indicates that the Court of Appeal clearly contemplated that there could be some factual situations in which the two heads of damages may well be alternative to each other. As recognised in _Mykytowych_ (at \[140\]), whether the court will award both or only one of the two heads of damages will ultimately depend on the facts and evidence at hand:

> … \[T\]hese two types of awards are meant to compensate for different kinds of loss. An award for loss of future earning capacity is given as part of _general_ damages in order to compensate a plaintiff for the weakening of his competitive position in the open labour market (see _Smith v Manchester Corporation _\[1974\] 17 KIR 1 (“_Smith_”) at 8), whereas an award for loss of future earnings is a form of _special_ damages awarded for real assessable loss proved by evidence (see _Fairley v John Thompson (Design & Contracting Division) Ltd_ \[1973\] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 40 at 42). **Whether the court will: (a) grant both types of awards; (b) grant an award for loss of future earning capacity while refusing to grant an award for loss of future earnings; or (c) ****_vice versa_**** is dependent on and determined by the evidence before the court** (see _Chai Kang Wei _at \[21\]).

> \[emphasis in italics original; emphasis added in bold\]

115    Interestingly, on the facts of _Samuel Chai_ itself, the defendant had raised a related argument that since a substantial award for LFE had already been made, only a nominal award for LEC should be given. This was rejected by the Court of Appeal at \[23\]:

> 23    We should also address **the Appellant’s argument that in the event that the court found that there was sufficient evidence to award loss of future earnings, then only a nominal award for loss of earning capacity should be given where a substantial award was made for loss of future earnings**. In making this contention, the Appellant assumed that there was an inverse relationship between the two heads of damages. No authority was cited in support of this proposition. Given that we have pointed out earlier that the two heads of damages are separate and distinct, it must also naturally mean there is simply no remaining logical basis for such an argument to succeed. **The Appellant’s proposition of an inverse relationship seemed to assume that there was an overlapping loss component in** **_both_** **heads of damages. However, the Appellant failed to point out any overlapping compensatory factor to support a proposition that such an inverse relationship existed.**

> \[emphasis in italics original; emphasis in bold added\]

116    To my mind, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning was undoubtedly correct on the particular facts of the case. It will be recalled from \[77\] above that in _Samuel Chai_, the plaintiff managed to remain in the same line of work as a physiotherapist before and after the accident. The award for LFE was calculated based only on the decrease in the number of hours the plaintiff was able to work as physiotherapist as a result of the accident. It assumed that the plaintiff would continue working in that same job. On the other hand, the award for LEC compensated for an additional loss – specifically, the risk of the plaintiff subsequently _losing_ her job as a physiotherapist and suffering financial damage because of her competitive disadvantage in obtaining comparable employment. Seen in this way, there was clearly “no overlapping loss component in both heads of damages”. Indeed, a similar explanation was given by the High Court judge below and this was not disturbed on appeal (see _Shaw Linda Gillian v Chai Kang Wei Samuel_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 187</span> at \[38\]). This is plainly distinguishable from the present facts, which I discuss at \[126\]-\[129\] below.

117    Notably, in _Lua Bee Kiang_, which I have found to be analogous to the present facts, the plaintiff had received an award for _both_ LFE and LEC. To refresh one’s memory:

> (a)     Before the High Court, the award for LFE was calculated on the basis that (i) the plaintiff could no longer earn his higher pre-accident income as a carpenter; and (ii) he could only earn a lower post-accident income as a cleaner (see _Yeo Chee Siong v Salpac (S) Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 304</span> at \[32\]-\[36\]). The plaintiff was awarded the difference in earnings, and this was affirmed on appeal (see _Lua Bee Kiang_ at \[62\]).

> (b)     The High Court judge then awarded an additional $5,000 for LEC on the basis that: (i) the plaintiff was also at risk of losing his post-accident job as a cleaner; and (ii) his injuries continued to affect his _post-accident_ work (which presumably translated into a competitive disadvantage for such work). I pause here to observe that given such a basis of assessment for the LEC award, there would have been _no_ overlap in the losses compensated for by way of LFE and LEC. However, as mentioned at \[86\]-\[87\] and \[91\] above, the Court of Appeal took a different approach to LEC in the course of dismissing the defendant’s appeal. It essentially assessed LEC on the basis that (i) the plaintiff “could no longer work as a carpenter after the accident”; and (ii) he “now has to work as a cleaner, for which he is paid less”.

118    Given the Court of Appeal’s basis for assessing LFE and LEC in _Lua Bee Kiang_, there appears to be a clear overlap between the two heads of damages. Specifically, the reduction in the plaintiff’s future earnings (which was the subject of the LFE award) appears to more or less represent the financial damage the plaintiff would suffer because of his competitive disadvantage in the carpentry industry. Yet, there was no ruling in _Lua Bee Kiang_ that such an overlap existed or was otherwise impermissible.

119    In my opinion, however, it cannot be assumed that the Court of Appeal in _Lua Bee Kiang_ had specifically decided the issue of overcompensation. Notably, the defendant in that case does not appear to have even raised the point before either the High Court or the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal also did not deal with the issue anywhere in its reasoning. That being so, the better view is that _Lua Bee Kiang_ simply did not engage the issue of overcompensation since it was not raised by either parties or the court (see the Court of Appeal’s similar reasoning in _AnAn Group (Singapore) Ptd Ltd v VTB Bank (Public Joint Stock Company)_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 1158</span> at \[28\]-\[29\] where it had to interpret its prior decision in _Metalform Asia Pte Ltd v Holland Leedon Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 268</span>). Respectfully, I therefore do not interpret _Lua Bee Kiang_ as being direct authority on the issue of overcompensation.

120    I turn next to the Court of Appeal’s decision in _Chang Ah Lek_, which was issued some time ago in 1998 though it remains good authority. The case essentially involved the third type of fact-pattern discussed earlier. Prior to the accident, the plaintiff worked as a subcontractor dealing with iron works. Due to his injuries, he could no longer continue in his higher-paying pre-accident line of work, and took up a lower-paying post-accident job as an overseer. Initially, the assistant registrar awarded $78,000 for “loss of earnings” (which comprised both pre-trial loss of earnings as well as LFE) and $17,000 for LEC. The High Court judge set these awards aside and dealt with the issues afresh. On further appeal to the Court of Appeal, it was remarked (at \[22\]) that since the assistant registrar had already awarded the plaintiff for $51,000 for LFE, he ought not to have awarded a further sum of $17,000 for LEC because “\[t\]his was two awards for the _same item of loss_” (emphasis added). Although the basis on which each award was made is unclear, the Court of Appeal’s remarks clearly support the argument that in certain circumstances, awards for LFE and LEC _may_ overlap by compensating for the same item of loss.

121    This argument is also reinforced by the authorities which have rejected claims for pre-trial LEC. Whilst it is well-established that damages may be awarded for _post-trial_ LEC, our courts have never recognised a claim for _pre-trial_ LEC. In _Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 178</span> (“**_Ronnie Tan_**”), the plaintiff suffered whiplash and residual disabilities that affected his work as a litigation lawyer. Having found that there was insufficient evidence to award pre-trial loss of earnings, the High Court judge held that there was also no reason to allow the plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial LEC. This was on the ground that any claim for pre-trial LEC, even if quantifiable, should have been “subsumed” under the plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial loss of earnings in order to avoid any “unintended double counting”. This was explained (at \[24\]-\[25\]) as follows:

> 24    … Accordingly, I assessed his “loss of pre-trial earnings” to be zero. **Having assessed the “loss of pre-trial earnings” to be zero, there would be no reason, as will be seen from the cases below, to award any amount for “pre-trial loss of earning capacity” on top of the “loss of pre-trial earnings”.**

> 25    I shall explain further. **The actual state of affairs between the time of the accident and the time of trial would be known.** Hence, there would be no “unknown risks” or “unknown factors” exacerbating the loss which must be accounted for. In a sense, **all such “unknowns” would be known and manifested in the actual income earned for the pre-trial period.** For instance, if there was a risk of termination, and he was in fact never terminated during the pre-trial period, the probability of termination during that period would be zero as no termination took place. **Hence, in most cases, the assessment of pre-trial loss of earnings could be made with a fair degree of accuracy on account of the facts being already available, unlike that for post-trial losses. As such**, **even if the “pre-trial loss of earning capacity” were to be quantifiable, it should have been subsumed under “loss of pre-trial earnings”** **to avoid any unintended double counting**: see also the case of _Teo Seng Kiat_ (\[18\] _supra_).

> \[emphasis added in bold and bold underline\]

122    Subsequently, in _Yap Boon Fong Yvonne v Wong Kok Mun Alvin and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 230</span> (“**_Yap Boon Fong_**”), the Court of Appeal considered for the first time whether to recognise a claim for pre-trial LEC. At \[30\]-\[31\], it stated as follows:

> 30     **We begin by explaining the concepts of loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity**. In _Chai Kang Wei Samuel v Shaw Linda Gillian_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 587</span> (“_Samuel Chai_”), this court clarified at \[20\] that … **\[t\]he two heads of damages are meant to compensate for different losse**s. We note that when describing the concept of loss of earning capacity, the courts consistently refer to the risk of “future” loss... This, fundamentally, is what an award for loss of earning capacity is intended to compensate for.

> 31     **While it is well established that damages may be awarded for** **_post-trial_** **loss of earning capacity, this court has never recognised any claim for** **_pretrial_** **loss of earning capacity. This, to us, makes eminent sense because any loss actually incurred by a plaintiff prior to the date of the trial would already have been known, and must be capable of being proved by the plaintiff. This is also why our courts, when assessing pre-trial loss, have generally only recognised claims for pre-trial loss of** **_earnings_** **, which are treated as claims for special damages which attract the requirement that the plaintiff must provide strict proof of actual loss**: see _Wee Sia Tian v Long Thik Boon_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 420</span> (“_Wee Sia Tian_”) at \[15\]–\[16\]; _Teo Seng Kiat v Goh Hwa Teck_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 333</span> at \[8**\]. The distinctions between pre-trial and post-trial loss, and between general and special damages**, were succinctly explained by the House of Lords in _British Transport Commission v Gourley_ <span class="citation">\[1956\] AC 185</span> at 206:

>> In an action for personal injuries the damages are always divided into two main parts. First, there is what is referred to as _special damage, which has to be specially pleaded and proved_. This consists of out-of-pocket expenses and _loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial_, and is generally capable of substantially exact calculation. Secondly, there is general damage which the law implies and is not specially pleaded. This includes compensation for pain and suffering and the like, and, if the injuries suffered are such as to lead to continuing or permanent disability, compensation for loss of earning power in the future. \[emphasis added\]

> \[emphasis in italics original; emphasis added in bold\]

123    The Court of Appeal then went on to approve the reasoning in _Ronnie Tan_ (quoted above at \[121\]) and held that Singapore law does not recognise a claim for pre-trial LEC. It explained (at \[40\]-\[42\]):

> 40    Similar to what was said in _Nirumalan_, these statements \[in _Ronnie Tan_ at \[24\]-\[25\]\] evinced the court’s antipathy towards the idea of awarding compensation for loss which did not actually materialise. In Chan J’s words, the probability of loss on the facts of the case was “zero”, and there was therefore no basis to award any damages. Once again, we think this coheres with **the established approach of examining whether any actual provable loss had been suffered by the plaintiff**.

> 41    In our jurisprudence, our courts have clearly taken the position that **a plaintiff must prove his pre-trial losses as a matter of special damages. Past events must be capable of proof. In the same vein, all pre-trial losses must be losses that have actually been incurred by the plaintiff and that can be specially proved.** This, we think, also explains why the existing local authorities such as _Samuel Chai_ (\[30\] _supra_) refer to the concept of earning capacity only when the courts are making an inquiry that looks towards the future rather than the past.

> 42     **We therefore decline to recognise claims for pre-trial loss of earning capacity**. For the avoidance of doubt, **this proposition applies equally to** cases where loss of pre-trial earnings would be difficult or impossible to prove, and also to **cases where there would be no risk of double recovery of the sort envisioned by Chan J in** **_Ronnie Tan_** **by awarding damages for pre- trial loss of earnings and earning capacity at the same time**. In our judgment, a contrary holding would risk muddying our existing jurisprudence which now clearly and correctly requires that **a plaintiff must specially prove his pre-trial losses to recover damages**. For similar reasons, we also do not think that a claim in respect of pre-trial loss of earnings can be treated as a matter for general damages, as this would otherwise blur the well-established distinction between general and special damages.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

124    As can be seen, both _Yap Boon Fong_ (at \[42\]) and _Ronnie Tan_ (at \[25\]) had examined the concept of loss of earnings and LEC in the context of _pre-trial losses_. Even though at a conceptual level, the two are meant to compensate for different things, the Court of Appeal and the High Court both acknowledged that there may well be cases where the two overlap. In such situations, awarding both LFE and LEC would lead to “double counting” or “double recovery”. Ultimately, the Court of Appeal refused to recognise claims for pre-trial LEC on the basis that any pre-trial losses would already be known at the time of trial and should be strictly proved as part of special damages for pre-trial loss of earnings.

125    Accordingly, it seems to me that the general legal principles governing LFE and LEC do not preclude a finding that on the present facts, the awards for these two heads of damages do overlap. As can be seen from the authorities above, that the two are distinct and separate _concepts_ does not mean that they will _never_ overlap in any factual situation. With that, I proceed to consider the present case.

#### Whether there is any overlap between LFE and LEC on the present facts

126    In my judgment, making an award for LEC _in addition_ to the award for LFE would indeed overcompensate the Plaintiff here. To explain, the award for LEC would essentially compensate the Plaintiff for the financial damage arising from the disadvantage he will face competing in the open labour market for construction workers. As held in _Mykytowych_ at \[141\], the court should assess LEC in the round, taking into account all relevant factors such as “the plaintiff’s age, his skills, the nature of his disability, whether he is capable of undertaking only one type of work or _whether he is capable of undertaking other types of work_ as well” (emphasis added). As mentioned at \[102\] above, the _extent_ of the financial damage that the Plaintiff will suffer is to be assessed on the basis that: (a) he will be disadvantaged in obtaining employment as a construction worker in future; but (b) he will still be able to do lower-paying odd jobs and menial work back at home.

127    As for the award for LFE given at \[65\] above, this is calculated on the basis that the Plaintiff has lost his pre-accident job as a construction worker and will _never_ be able to obtain employment in the construction industry for the remainder of his working life in either Singapore or Bangladesh. He is thus compensated for the drop from (a) his future earnings in the construction industry in Singapore and Bangladesh had he not been injured; to (b) his future earnings now that he is confined to doing lower-paying odd jobs and other menial work in Bangladesh.

128    That being the case, I find that the award for LFE already compensates the Plaintiff for any financial damage that may arise from him being at a competitive disadvantage in the open labour market for construction workers. Specifically, the LFE award already compensates him for the _reduction in future earnings_ he will suffer in the event that his competitive disadvantage leads to _a complete failure_ on his part to ever obtain a job in the construction industry again and he is confined to doing lower-paying odd jobs for the rest of his working life.

129    In other words, the drop in future earnings (which is the subject of the LFE award) more or less represents _the full extent of the financial damage_ the plaintiff might suffer because of his competitive disadvantage in the construction industry. Indeed, the Plaintiff fails to point to any other way in which this disadvantage would cause any additional loss or financial damage _on top of_ his LFE. Accordingly, I find that on the present facts, the awards for LFE and LEC clearly overlap. Allowing both claims would permit double recovery for what is effectively the same loss. In the circumstances, the Plaintiff is only entitled to claim for either LFE or LEC, but not both.

#### Whether LFE or LEC should be awarded

130    It remains for me to decide which of the two heads of damages should be awarded. In _Teo Sing Keng_ at \[40\], the Court of Appeal set out general guidelines as to when an award for LEC, rather than an award for LFE, should be made:

> 40    An award for loss of earning capacity, as opposed to an award for loss of earnings, is generally made in the following cases:

>> (1)    where, at the time of trial, the plaintiff is in employment and has suffered no loss of earnings, but there is a risk that he may lose that employment at some time in the future, and may then, as a result of his injury, be at a disadvantage in getting another job or an equally well paid job;

>> (2)    where there is no available evidence of the plaintiff’s earnings to enable the court to properly calculate future earnings, for example, young children who have no earnings on which to base an assessment for loss of future earnings.

131    In _Liu Haixiang_ at \[24\]-\[27\], Judith Prakash J (as she was then) discussed the above passage and observed that:

> 25     **It can be seen from the above discussion \[in** **_Teo Sing Keng_** **\] that where there is a measurable loss of earnings, the correct award is for loss of future earnings.** In this case, there was a measurable loss of earnings because, due to his injury, the plaintiff was no longer able to work as a construction worker in Singapore and at the time of the trial he was, in fact, no longer in such employment.

> …

> 27    It would be recalled that in _Teo Sing Keng_, the Court opined that a loss of earning capacity award would also be appropriate where there was no available evidence of the plaintiff’s earnings to enable the Court to properly calculate future earnings. **This was not the case here.** The documentation established what the plaintiff earned during his stay in Singapore. The plaintiff also gave evidence of what he had earned in China prior to coming to Singapore and that evidence was not challenged. Whilst there may be some gaps in the evidence relating to the possible salary that the plaintiff might achieve in the future, such gaps mean that the calculation of the plaintiff’s damages might lead to a lower figure than the plaintiff would like but those gaps do not make it impossible to derive an award on the basis of loss of future earnings. The evidence in this case supports the plaintiff’s claim that the proper award would be for loss of future earnings.

> \[emphasis added in bold\]

Similar views were expressed by the Court of Appeal in _Chang Ah Lek_ (at \[25\] and \[31\]-\[32\]).

132    I have already found earlier that there is sufficient evidence to properly assess the Plaintiff’s LFE. Since there is clearly a measurable loss of future earnings on the Plaintiff’s part, the appropriate award would be for LFE. I accordingly decline to award LEC so as to avoid overcompensating the Plaintiff for the same loss.

### Future Medical Expenses

133    In submissions, the Plaintiff claims S$5,550 in respect of the following future medical expenses, as estimated by his doctors:

> (a)     Physical therapy in respect of the back and pelvis injuries costing S$640 to S$960 per region.

> (b)     Pain treatment (_ie_, analgesics, nerve medication, vitamins and muscle relaxants) costing S$1,825 to S$3,650/year.

> (c)     Medical consultation costing S$2,025 to S$3,950 in total (one consultation every 3 months, at a rate of S$100 to S$150 per consultation).

134    On the other hand, the Defendants submit that no award should be made. This is on the ground that the Plaintiff has not shown any evidence that he has sought medical treatment in Bangladesh, or that he has sought any medical treatment at all between March 2018 and March 2022 (besides one session of physiotherapy).

135    I have several difficulties of my own with the Plaintiff’s claim. To begin with, it is entirely unclear how the Plaintiff derived his proposed figure of S$5,550 based on the various estimated expenses given by his medical doctors. In the absence of any explanation, the proposed figure appears to be entirely arbitrary. In respect of the future expenses for pain medication and medical consultations, the Plaintiff’s medical reports also do not mention how long such medication and/or consultations are necessary.

136    More importantly, the Plaintiff’s claims are based on the cost of medical treatment in Singapore. The Plaintiff testified that pending the assessment hearing, he had continued to seek medical treatment in Bangladesh and that he had the intention to eventually return to Singapore to receive further treatment. In my view, however it is highly questionable whether it is reasonable or necessary for the Plaintiff to seek medical treatment in Singapore. This is especially given that the Plaintiff has returned to Bangladesh and has supposedly been receiving medical treatment there without any apparent issues. Notably, the Plaintiff expressly admitted in cross-examination that he would be able to attend physiotherapy and consult doctors with the appropriate expertise in Bangladesh. In fact, he said that he had previously consulted a neurologist in Bangladesh although he did not adduce any supporting evidence to show the expenses incurred. He further conceded that the cost of consulting a neurologist in Bangladesh would be “much cheaper” than consulting a neurologist in Singapore.

137    In the circumstances, I think that any award for future medical expenses ought to be made on the basis that such medical treatment can be obtained in Bangladesh, which would likely be at a lower cost than in Singapore. As observed by the Court of Appeal in _Poh Huat Heng_ at \[64\]-\[65\], when the plaintiff is a foreign national and has returned to his home country and is receiving medical treatment there, it follows “as a matter of logic and common sense that the cost of medical care in his home country should be the basis upon which to calculate…the amount to be awarded for future medical expenses”. The Court of Appeal further noted that the cost of the medical treatment in the foreign country must be established by evidence.

138    In the present case, however, the Plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence showing how much it would cost in Bangladesh to receive the various medical treatments needed. That being the case, he has simply failed to discharge his burden of proving this head of claim. I will accordingly only award a nominal amount of S$500.

## Special damages

### Pre-Trial Loss of Earnings

139    Soon after the accident in January 2018, the Plaintiff ceased employment as a construction worker and he was repatriated home to Bangladesh in March 2018. The Plaintiff claims S$36,310 for pre-trial loss of earnings between the date of the accident (January 2018) and the date of the assessment hearing (March 2022). He submits as follows:

> (a)     If not for the accident, between January 2018 and February 2022, he would have earned S$44,100 (being 49 months x S$900/month) as a construction worker in Singapore.

> (b)     After the accident, the Plaintiff returned to Bangladesh and recuperated for several months before he began working again. Between September 2018 and February 2022, the Plaintiff earned S$7,790, being 41 months x 12,000 Takas/month (about S$190/month).

As such, the Plaintiff calculates his actual pre-trial loss of earnings at S$36,310 (being S$44,100 less S$7,790).

140    The Defendants raise two specific objections in their submissions:

> (a)     First, the Plaintiff’s claim fails to account for medical leave wages that he had been paid between 18 January 2018 and 6 April 2018.

> (b)     Second, after the Plaintiff returned to Bangladesh on 5 March 2018, the Plaintiff had no good reason to take 5 to 6 months’ off to rest. As such, 6 months’ income of 7,000 to 8,000 Takas/month ought to be deducted from the Plaintiff’s claim.

The Defendants’ submissions conclude by saying that they are “agreeable to offer S$2,000 for this head of claim in light of the 2 months of hospitalization leave that the Plaintiff was on”. This is somewhat puzzling, given that their objections above only challenge _specific_ portions of the entire claim amount of S$36,310.

141    I deal with the Defendants two objections in turn. In respect of the period of 18 January 2018 to 6 April 2018, it is undisputed that the Plaintiff was on hospitalisation leave. The Plaintiff himself admitted in his AEIC that he had received medical leave wages during that time, and that these wages ought to be deducted from his claim. As such, I agree with the Defendants that no pre-trial loss of earnings should be awarded for this period.

142    The remaining claim period should be for 7 April 2018 to 28 March 2022 (the latter being the date of assessment). The Plaintiff’s evidence on his post-accident income has already been summarised out at \[45(c)\] above. With respect to that, the Defendants’ contention is that the Plaintiff had no good reason to take 5 to 6 months’ off to rest after returning to Bangladesh in March 2018. According to the Defendants, there was no medical report stating that the Plaintiff was unable to work during that time. It is thus said that 6 months’ income of 7,000 to 8,000 Takas/month ought to be deducted from the Plaintiff’s claim for pre-trial loss of earnings.

143    Notably, the Defendants’ submission impliedly accepts the Plaintiff’s evidence that when he first started doing odd jobs in Bangladesh, he earned 7,000 to 8,000 Takas/month. This affirms, to some extent, my reliance on the Plaintiff’s own post-accident income figures as set out in my earlier discussion on LFE. That aside, it is my view that even after being discharged from the hospital in April 2018, it was reasonable for the Plaintiff to have a period of recuperation as he adjusted back to daily life in Bangladesh with his injuries. However, in the absence of any medical evidence and explanation by the Plaintiff as to why the full period of 5 to 6 months was necessary, I find that at most, 2 months would be a reasonable period of time for recuperation.

144    I assess the Plaintiff’s pre-trial loss of earnings as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.9%"><col width="22.62%"><col width="37.86%"><col width="20.62%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Multiplicand</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Multiplier</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Multiplicand x Multiplier</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Pre-trial earnings had the accident not occurred</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$900/month</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">47 months, 21 days for the period between 7 April 2018 (date after expiry of hospitalization leave) and 27 March 2022 (date prior to the assessment hearing)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$43,530‬</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Pre-trial earnings after the accident</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12,000 Takas/month, which is equivalent to S$192/month</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">46 months, 27 days for the period between 1 May 2018 (when the Plaintiff ought to have begun working in Bangladesh to earn an income) and 27 March 2022 (date prior to the assessment hearing)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$9,132.80</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" colspan="3" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Pre-trial loss of earnings:</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S$34,397.20</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

145    As for the multiplicand for the Plaintiff’s actual pre-trial earnings, I have used the figure of 12,000 Takas/month, which is equivalent to S$192/month. I note that according to the Plaintiff’s own evidence, he had initially earned 7,000-8,000 Takas/month doing odd jobs and his income later increased to 8,000-10,000 Takas/month (see \[45(c)\] above). It was only at the assessment hearing that he mentioned for the first time that he had taken up a new job as a security guard at a fish farm earning 10,000-12,000 Takas/month. Nevertheless, in the Plaintiff’s own submissions, he was content to uniformly use the highest figure of 12,000 Takas/month as the multiplicand to calculate his actual pre-trial earnings (see \[139(b)\] above). As such, I have proceeded on the same basis, notwithstanding that I was otherwise prepared to accept the Plaintiff’s various post-accident income figures. I accordingly award S$34,397.20 for pre-trial loss of earnings.

### Medical Expenses

146    Parties agree that the Plaintiff is entitled to claim S$440.46 in respect of medical expenses that he has incurred to date. I accordingly award him S$440.46 for this claim.

### Transport Expenses

147    The Plaintiff claims S$250 in transport expenses. This on the basis that he had to take a private hire taxi to his medical consultations and to his solicitors’ office because of his injuries. However, the Plaintiff did not specify in submissions or his AEIC how many trips he had to take, or the cost incurred per trip. As the Defendants highlight, the Plaintiff only produced receipts for transport expenses totalling S$92.41. That being the case, I only award S$92.41 for transport expenses.

149    I accordingly award the Plaintiff total damages of S$94,822.07 against the Defendants. This is broken down as follows:

> (a)     General damages of S$59,892, comprising (i) S$31,600 for pain and suffering; (ii) S$27,792 for LFE; and (iii) S$500 for future medical expenses.

> (b)     Special damages of S$34,930.07, comprising (i) S$34,397.20 for pre-trial loss of earnings; (ii) S$440.46 for medical expenses; and (iii) S$92.41 for transport expenses.

150    On the issue of interest, following _Teo Sing Keng_ (at \[50\]-\[55\]), I order as follows:

> (a)     Interest to run on general damages for pain and suffering at 5.33% per annum from the date of writ to the date of judgment.

> (b)     Interest to run on special damages at 2.67% per annum from date of accident to the date of judgment.

> (c)     No interest is awarded on the future items of claim (namely, the award for LFE and future medical expenses) since the Plaintiff has not been kept out of money for the same.

151    I will hear parties on costs at a later date.
