### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## CHARGES

The Accused persons were tried jointly.

2       Accused Tan Boon Chian (hereafter “Tan”) claimed trial to the following charge:

> DAC 929986/2018

> _“You, between 4_ th _December 2017 and 8_ th _December 2017, in Singapore, did knowingly receive payment of SGD$250/- from one CYT, in connection with the actual sexual exploitation of a child, namely CYT, male/then 16 years old (DOB: 23 April 2001), who was a trafficked victim at the material time, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 6(1) punishable under section 6(2)(a) of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act 2014.”_

3       Accused Liew Beng Huat (hereafter “Liew”) claimed trial to this charge:

> DAC 929980/2019

> _“ You, between 4th December 2017 and 8th December 2017, in Singapore, did knowingly received payment of SGD$90, from one Tan Boon Chian, in connection with the actual sexual exploitation of a child, namely CYT, male/then 16 years old (DOB:23 April 2001), who was a trafficked victim at the material time, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 6(1) punishable under section 6(2) of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act 2014.”_

4       At the conclusion of the trial, I acquitted both the Accused persons of their respective charges. The Prosecution is dissatisfied with the acquittal.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

5       These facts, mostly adduced from Tan himself, set the background for this case[^1].

6       Tan was the owner of a brothel, located at 79A Rowell Road. From about March 2015 when he took over the business from one “Ong Ah”, until 8 Dec 2017 (the date on which the brothel was raided), he ran the business of a brothel at the said location. The opening hours of the brothel were from 6 pm to 1 am and the premises were not used for any other purposes. At all other times of the day, it would be locked.

7       Tan’s brothel was used by Thai male prostitutes. Since Ong Ah’s time, it had always been Thai male prostitutes (also known as “_ladyboys[^2]_”) using the brothel. Each Thai prostitute paid Tan $50 a day to use the place for prostitution. A plastic bag would be passed around the prostitutes gathered at 79A Rowell Road daily, who would each put $50 into the plastic bag. This plastic bag would eventually be handed over to Tan.

8       One “Ah Boy” helped Tan with the brothel operations at 79A Rowell Road for a salary of $70 a day. Ah Boy had previously worked for Ong Ah and he simply continued his duties after Tan had taken over 79A Rowell Road. Ah Boy’s duties included collecting $50 from each of the prostitutes, supervising the cleaning of the place at the end of the opening hours, alerting the prostitutes when the police came, settling disputes with customers[^3]. It is the Prosecution’s case that after Ah Boy ceased working for Tan, Liew helped Tan with the tasks in the brothel and was paid $30 a day.

9       It was at this brothel at 79A Rowell Road that 16 year-old CYT was working as a male prostitute when the brothel was raided on 8 December 2017.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

10     It is not disputed that at the time when CYT was working as a male prostitute at 79A Rowell Road, he was merely 16 years old (Date of Birth: 23 April 2001[^4]). Being under the age of 18, CYT was a “_child_”, as defined in section 2 of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (“PHTA”).

##### PW1’s evidence

11     PW1 CYT testified that he first arrived in Singapore by bus on 4 December 2017. This was his first time to Singapore. He came to Singapore to work - to provide “_sex service_” which included “_oral sex_”, “_kissing_”, “_oral kissing”_[^5].

12     CYT got the idea to come to Singapore to work as a sex worker when he was in Thailand. He testified that back in Thailand, a male friend of his, one “Oom” had told him that if he (CYT) came to Singapore to work as a sex worker, he (CYT) would be able to get a lot of money. CYT described Oom as a “_ladyboy_” – a male who wants to become a female.

13     CYT then made the decision to come to Singapore to work as a sex worker. It is his evidence that Oom “_arranged everything_”[^6] for him; took a photocopy of his passport, told him to go to the bus-station to take the bus[^7], under the instructions of one “Maebo”. CYT understood from Oom that he would be working under the said Maebo; that he came under Maebo’s contract, which meant that he would have to pay Maebo S$1,000 from what he earned from providing sexual services and for giving him the chance to work[^8]. According to CYT, Maebo also gave Oom the number of the person CYT was to contact when he arrived in Singapore. There was no doubt that that the purpose of CYT’s trip to Singapore on 4 December 2017 was to provide sexual services.

14     En route to Singapore from Hat Yai, Thailand, CYT got acquainted with three other Thai ladyboys on the bus and upon talking with them, he came to know that the three of them also came under the contract of Maebo. The terms of their contract were similar to CYT’s. The purpose of their visit to Singapore, as was CYT’s, was to provide sexual services. However, at immigration, CYT only received a social visit pas of 7 days whereas the other ladyboys received a social visit pass of 1 month.

15     When the bus from Hat Yai arrived in Golden Mile, Singapore, they all alighted. CYT testified that he did not have to call the person whose contact Oom had given him. One of the three ladyboys whom CYT met on the bus had made the phone call. As CYT understood it, it was a phone call made for somebody to come to fetch them from Golden Mile to the hotel[^9]. Subsequently, the four of them, including CYT, were met at Golden Mile by two other Thai ladyboys, named “Micky” and “Beer”. Thereafter, the group travelled by taxi to the hotel[^10] where they checked-in.

16     CYT testified that he started work the very day that he arrived in Singapore i.e. 4 December 2017. When informed by his “_senior friends_” that work was to begin, he walked with them from the hotel to the 79A Rowell Road, in batches of three, as instructed by the older ladyboys_[^11]_.

17     At the brothel, CYT changed into his bikini; he purchased condoms, tissue and K-Y (a lubricant) from the store next to the brothel with the help of the senior ladyboys since he could not speak English. These items would be brought over to the brothel from the store as CYT was told that they were not allowed to go out of the brothel lest the police would catch them. CYT testified that he personally observed Tan putting a phone at the recess area of the door[^12] inside 79A Rowell Road. If there were police, the phone would ring and the white door would be closed. Once the area was clear of police, the white door would be opened[^13].

18     From the day he arrived in Singapore on 4 December 2017, CYT prostituted himself at the brothel at 79A Rowell Road. He started work at about 530pm or 630 pm daily and ended work only at about 1 am the next morning. With the other Thai ladyboys, he would sit behind the metal gate and wait for potential customers. He provided penetrative sexual services, including oral and anal sex to customers for money. CYT worked at the brothel until 8th December 2017 when the brothel was raided[^14].

##### Specific Roles of Tan (“Ah Boss”) and Liew (“Ah Ker”)

19     In court, CYT recognised both the Accused persons. He identified Tan as “Ah Boss” and Liew as “Ah Ker”, as told to him. CYT testified that he was told by his “_senior friends_” that both these persons will help them to “_look after the place and look out for police and clients_”[^15]. CYT also testified that he paid $50 each day, either to Ah Boss or Ah Ker and he had paid a total of $250 for the period of 4-8 December 2017, including the day that he was arrested[^16]. A plastic bag would be passed round the ladyboys who would each put $50 inside.

20     After work at the brothel each day, CYT and the rest of the ladyboys would either walk back in batches of three or take in a taxi[^17]. When they walked back to the hotel, Ah Boss would ride a bicycle ahead of them, to ensure there was no police and that it was clear to walk. Ah Boss would gesture by hand to indicate that it was “_clear of policeman_”. [^18]

21     As for Ah Ker, apart from collecting the fee of $50 from the ladyboys, it was CYT’s evidence that during the 5 days when he was working at the brothel, Ah Ker would be looking out for police and helping them to look for customers. He would also be the one who would bring them to clean the place, supervised the cleaning of the rooms[^19] and sometimes provided food for the ladyboys[^20].

##### Credibility of PW1 - CYT

22     Having heard CYT’s evidence and observed him in the giving of his evidence, I find him to be an honest witness; giving a clear and coherent account of why and how he came to work in Singapore, as well as the details of his work in Singapore. He was forthright as a witness even under cross-examination, readily agreeing that nobody had forced him to come to Singapore to work as a sex worker; that he had voluntarily applied for his own passport, entered into the contract with Maebo and bought his own bus ticket to Singapore[^21]. He candidly admitted that he had made the decision because he needed the money for his (sex-change) operation[^22]. Even when describing the roles that Tan and Liew played viz-a-viz the brothel, its operations and the ladyboys, CYT was straightforward in his account, with no tendency to exaggerate the roles played by either of the Accused persons. I find CYT to be a wholly credible witness and I accept his evidence. I was satisfied that it contained the truth relating to why and how he came to Singapore to work as a prostitute, and his work at the brothel after he arrived.

23     In addition, material portions of CYT’s evidence in relation to his work at the brothel, the roles of Tan and Liew and how the ladyboys were organised at the brothel, were consistent with the testimonies of PW2 Thanaphol Thuraphra and PW3 Chutisara Chaikham. Both of them worked at the brothel at 79A Rowell Road with CYT in the same period of time. PW2 Thanphol was identified by CYT as “_Beer_”, one of the two Thai ladyboys who received him at Golden Mile when he first arrived in Singapore. This was confirmed by PW2 himself when he came on to the stand[^23].

##### Evidence of PW2 Thanaphol Thuraphra

24     Apart from testifying to facts similar to how he would get to the brothel from the hotel and how he would obtain his condoms and KY gel, PW2 Thanphol also testified that Tan was pointed out to her as the “_owner of this house…..the boss_[^24]”. He would stand in front of the gate and secure clients for the ladyboys[^25]. PW2 also spoke of one occasion where Tan rode the bicycle and all the ladyboys walked, following his bicycle back to their accommodation[^26].

25     In relation to Liew whom he referred to as “_uncle_”, PW2 stated that Liew was the one looking out for police outside the house. He would also be the one to make a phone call for the ladyboys to come to work when Ah Boy[^27] was not around. In essence, Liew would do whatever Ah Boy had to do when Ah Boy was not around, including the collection of rental. Each day, either Ah Boy or Liew would come with a plastic bag. The plastic bag would be passed around and each ladyboy would have to pay a fee of $50[^28]. The $50 would come from their earnings.

##### Evidence of PW3 Chutisara Chaikham

26     PW3 was one of the ladyboys who came from Hat Yai on the same bus as CYT. Like CYT, PW3 was under the contract of Maebo[^29] and was met by PW2 at Golden Mile when he arrived in Singapore[^30].

27     PW3’s evidence was highly consistent with CYT and PW2’s in relation to how he would walk in groups of three to four to the brothel, following those who were more experienced; how he would purchase condoms and KY gel from the shop next door. PW3 also identified Liew as “_uncle_” and pointed him out as one who helped with the cleaning of the room and the collection of $50[^31]. On other days of his work, PW3 identified Tan as the one collecting the money[^32]. In his evidence, PW3 also described either Tan or Liew leading the ladyboys back to the hotel from their workplace, on either foot or bicycle[^33].

28     I find both PW2 and PW3 to be credible witnesses, giving straightforward and clear accounts in their testimonies. Their evidence was not shaken under cross-examination; they maintained their positons as to the roles both Tan and Liew played in respect of the brothel and its operations, including their management of the ladyboys. As highlighted, their evidence was largely consistent with the evidence of CYT and corroborated several material portions of his evidence. There was no basis to suspect any collusion amongst these Prosecution witnesses and I was satisfied that they were all telling the truth.

## ELEMENTS OF THE CHARGE

29     The key elements of the charge under section 6 of the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act (“PHTA”) are:

> a)     There was a trafficked victim at the material time;

> b)     There was actual sexual exploitation of the trafficked victim;

> c)     There was payment in connection with such actual sexual exploitation;

> d)     The Accused had received such payment with the knowledge that it was in connection with the actual sexual exploitation of the trafficked victim; and

> e)     It was received with the knowledge that such victim was a trafficked victim.

## CYT WAS A “TRAFFICKED VICTIM” FOR PURPOSES OF THE PHTA

30     A “_trafficked victim_” means “_an individual against whom an offence under section 3 is committed, and includes an alleged victim of the offence_”[^34]. Section 3 of the PHTA sets out the offence of trafficking in persons.

31     At the time of the offence, CYT was below 18 years old. Hence, by the definition in section 2 of the PHTA, he was a “_child_”[^35]. This fact is key in the entire case.

32     Because CYT was a child at the time of the offence, there are only two elements to be made out for an offence of trafficking in a child, as envisaged in Section 3(2) PHTA:

> a)     First, there must be an act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child; and

> b)     Second: it must be for the purpose of the exploitation.

33     Hence, so long as one of the acts in section 3(2) PHTA is done in respect of a child, the child may be considered a “_trafficked victim_”. There is no requirement for the Prosecution to prove the methods or means used for trafficking but it would be sufficient for the Prosecution to simply show that there was an act to recruit, transport, transfer, harbor or receive a child for the purposes of exploitation[^36]. It was deliberate on the part of Parliament to lower the threshold and standard of proof for child victims, in recognition of their vulnerability[^37].

34     This is in stark contrast to the trafficking of individuals (other than a child) where the means of trafficking - by the use of threat or force, or other form of coercion, abduction, fraud or deception, abuse of power or the abuse of a position of vulnerability of the individual or the giving to or receipt by another person having control over that individual of any money or other benefit to secure that other person’s consent[^38] - must be proven before the individual may be considered a “_trafficked victim_”.

35     Further and importantly, section 3(3) PHTA makes it clear that the consent of the child or of his parents are irrelevant. In this case, the accepted fact that CYT had come to Singapore to work as a sex worker completely on his own free will and volition did not vitiate the fact that he may a “_trafficked victim_”. He may also have personally bought his own bus ticket from Hat Yai and boarded the bus on his own to Singapore, in obedient adherence to instructions, but because of the fact that CYT is a child, none of these voluntary acts detract from a finding that he may be considered a “_trafficked victim_” so long as any of the acts in section 3(2) PHTA had been found to be committed in respect of him.

##### Act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of CYT, a child, had taken place

36     On the facts, I find that one of the acts listed in section 3(2) PHTA had been committed in respect of CYT. The evidence before me showed:

> 36.1     CYT may be said to have been recruited - he was informed by a friend in Hat Yai (Thailand), one “_Oom_” of the job opportunity in Singapore. Oom had told him that if he were to come to Singapore to work as a sex worker, he would be able to “_get a lot of money_”[^39]. Once CYT had made the decision to work in Singapore, Oom arranged everything, including for him to be working under “_Mae Bo’s contract_”[^40], taking a photocopy of his passport and giving him instructions to go to the bus station where he would board a bus to Singapore. Once he arrived in Singapore, all CYT needed to do was to make a phone call and he would be picked up[^41]. There appeared to be a well-established scheme of arrangement for persons such as CYT who agreed to come to Singapore as sex workers. Even if CYT had been the one who sought out the job opportunity initially, he may be said to have been eventually recruited;

> 36.2     CYT was instructed regarding transportation to Singapore. He was told how to get to Singapore from Hat Yai and who he was to contact when he arrived in Singapore. Notwithstanding CYT had bought his own bus ticket from Hat Yai to Singapore, boarded the bus on his own to Singapore, it was clear that specific instructions were given to him for travel in this manner and transfer arrangements had been made in advance such that he would be safely received in Singapore.

> 36.3     True enough, CYT was safely received when he arrived in Singapore. His arrival in Singapore was anticipated since plans were already in place to receive him and the other ladyboys on the same bus. PW2 testified that he was informed that “_4 ladyboys_” were coming. Ah Boy had told him and one “_Mickey_” to fetch the four ladyboys from one of the food stalls in Golden Mile. He found them right where he was told. PW2 then brought them to the hotel in two taxis[^42]. Again, without any initiative or effort on the part of CYT, a hotel had been arranged for CYT upon his arrival in Singapore.

> 36.4     At CYT’s workplace at 79A Rowell Road, there was evidence of harbouring as Tan, Liew or Ah Boy would assist to look out for the police and inform the prostitutes to hide and evade arrest when the police came. The payment of the $50 by CYT into the plastic bag daily was partly for that purpose. In addition, CYT was not free to come and go as he pleased. If he or any of the ladyboys wanted to leave 79A Rowell Road to go anywhere, they would have to seek permission and either Tan or Liew would bring them out to avoid arrest from the police[^43].

37     On the evidence before me, I was satisfied that one or more of the acts listed in s 3(2) PHTA had been committed in respect of CYT.

##### The act(s) committed was/were for the purpose of exploitation

38     In section 2 of the PHTA, the meaning of “e_xploitation”_ specifically includes, amongst other meanings, “_sexual exploitation_”. “Sexual exploitation”, in relation to an individual, “_means the involving of the individual in prostitution, sexual servitude or the provision of any other form of sexual service, including the commission of any obscene or indecent act by the individual_[^44]_….._”. There is clear, direct and undisputed testimony from CYT himself that he came to Singapore as a sex worker and did perform sexual services when he came to Singapore.

39     On the evidence, I was fully satisfied that both the elements required under section 3(2) of the PHTA in respect of CYT who was a child, had been proven. CYT was at the material time, objectively, a “_trafficked victim_” for purposes of the PHTA.

40     I can perhaps understand the discomfort the Defence had about CYT being described as a “_trafficked victim_”. On the facts of this case, the type of victim found in CYT did not seem to show up a classic case of a “_trafficked victim_” being sexually exploited - CYT having chosen to come to Singapore to work as a prostitute on his own free will, for his personal reasons. However, it bears repeating that because CYT was at the material time, below 18 years of age, the PHTA has specifically stipulated lower requirements for the trafficking offence to be made out for such child victims in recognition of their vulnerability; their consent entirely irrelevant. CYT was undoubtedly, a “_trafficked victim_”, by virtue of his age.

## THERE WAS ACTUAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CYT – THE TRAFFICKED VICTIM

41     CYT had testified unequivocally that at 79A Rowell Road, he provided sexual services to customers in the form of oral sex, anal sex and kissing. The customers were all male. He would charge the customers various rates, from $20 to $50, depending on who they are, and he was informed of these rates by his “senior friends”[^45]. CYT performed such sexual services from the day he arrived in Singapore i.e. 4 December 2017.

## THERE WAS PAYMENT IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTUAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION

42     There was payment in connection with CYT’s sexual exploitation. For each day that he worked as a prostitute at 79A Rowell Road from 4 to 8 December 2017, CYT paid $50, collected either by Tan or by Liew[^46]. To CYT, this was money for them helping to look out for the police whilst he was working at the brothel.

## BOTH THE ACCUSED PERSONS HAD RECEIVED SUCH PAYMENT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACTUAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CYT

##### Tan did receive payment

43     As mentioned, CYT testified that he paid $50 for each day that he worked, put into the bag that was passed around which would either be handed to Tan or to Liew. This would be earnings from his prostitution. In his statement, Tan confirmed that he received $50 daily from each Thai prostitute at his brothel[^47]. Tan knew that the money he received was in connection with CYT’s prostitution because he knew that CYT provided sexual services at the brothel. Tan confirmed that all the Thai ladyboys (including CYT) in the set of photographs shown to him during the giving of his police statement, were working at 79A Rowell Road and were arrested by the police on 8 December 2017.[^48] Tan received a total of $250 from CYT for the 5 days that CYT had worked at the brothel.

##### Liew did receive payment

44     I find that Liew was working for Tan and he was taking care of the brothel at 79A Rowell Road. He was paid $30 a day for 3 days that he worked for Tan at the brothel[^49]. Liew may describe it in any way he pleased and with the use of any labels, be it “_helping out_”, “_as friends_”, as “_caretaker_” whether full time or part-time. However, the evidence clearly showed that Liew did undertake tasks at the brothel and was in fact working for Tan. In his police statement recorded on 18 December 2017 (P13), Liew admitted to “_working_” for “Siao Kia” (who is Tan) at 79A Rowell Road. He explained in detail why he decided to work in the Rowell Road vicinity, what his working hours were like and described what his duties were in respect of 79A Rowell Road[^50]. Such facts could not have been made up by the recorder of the statement.

45     The details related in Liew’s police statement (P13) were also strikingly consistent with Tan’s police statements at P12 and P15. In his police statements, Tan set out similar details relating to Tan’s duties at 79A Rowell Road[^51]; how much Tan was paid[^52]. Tan confirmed that he had paid Liew $30 a day to help buy food and drinks for the ladyboys; Liew similarly stated in his statement that he received $90 in total for 3 days during the period from 4 December to 10 December 2017 when he worked in the brothel[^53].

46     Liew’s work in respect of the brothel was corroborated by the testimonies of CYT as well as PW2 and PW3. All of them worked at 79A Rowell Road and recognized Liew as the one who bought them food, cleaned up the place, look out for the police et cetera. Liew also identified CYT as one of the prostitutes working in the brothel from the set of photos shown to him during the recording of the statement.

47     Liew’s testimony in court was contradicted by his own police statements. Liew’s attempted explanation for how the statements came to be was not believable. I was satisfied that the police statements were accurately recorded and may be relied upon. I had no difficulty finding that that Liew had indeed received payment in connection with tasks he had carried out at the brothel where the ladyboys, including CYT who was working as a prostitute at the brothel.

##### Both Tan and Liew did receive payment with the knowledge that it was in connection with actual sexual exploitation of CYT

48     I find that both Tan and Liew did receive the above payments with the knowledge that it was in connection with actual sexual exploitation of CYT. CYT testified that he prostituted himself at the brothel. Tan had received $250 from CYT for the five days he worked at the brothel. Tan was aware that CYT was one of the prostitutes working in his brothel. Liew worked for Tan; he was well aware of the business that took place in the brothel and also recognized CYT as one of the prostitutes. He had received $90 from Tan for his work at the brothel during the same period.

49     As mentioned, for purposes of the PHTA, it did not matter that CYT had willingly come to Singapore to work in the sex trade and did in fact provide sexual services voluntarily. The undisputed evidence before me that CYT did provide sexual services to clients would amount to “_sexual exploitation_” under the PHTA.

50     I did not accept Tan’s contention that the payments made by CYT and the other prostitutes were mere rental payment for the use of the premises[^54]. According to CYT, the payment of $50 was so that Tan would look after them, look out for customers and watch out for police officers, amongst other duties. A locked gate at 79A Rowell Road (where the ladyboys even had had to buy their sundry items used in the course of their work by shouting their orders to the provision shop next door and the items would be brought to them), restricted ingress and egress to the premises, tip-off services and guided journeys back to the hotel showed the control that Tan and Liew had over the prostitutes, as opposed to a case of them simply renting out and managing premises with no knowledge of what goes on within. Even if an argument could be made that the $50 was for rental of the place, it was rental for a place used for sexual exploitation, and in this case, of CYT who was a child. The receipt of payment from CYT can still be considered as received from CYT “_in connection_” with his actual sexual exploitation, and it follows, the payment received by Liew from Tan, for working in the brothel, may be described as such.

## ELEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 6 PHTA

51     On the facts, I was satisfied that CYT was a trafficked victim for purposes of the PHTA. I was also satisfied that both Tan and Liew had received some form of payment, which was in connection with the actual sexual exploitation of CYT. It did not matter that Tan or Liew may not have been directly involved in the execution of any of the acts mentioned in section 3(2) PHTA. As stated in the Explanatory Statement to the Prevention of Human Trafficking Bill, section 6 is “_intended to cover a person who obtains a financial gain from the trafficking activity but who is not directly involved in the trafficking offence itself or in the abetment of it_”[^55].

52     However, a key ingredient which Prosecution needs to prove is that Tan and/or Liew did receive such payments, with the knowledge that CYT was a trafficked victim.

53     Objectively, CYT was a trafficked victim for the purposes of the PHTA and payments had been received by Tan and Liew in connection with his actual sexual exploitation. However, if Tan and/or Liew did not know that CYT was a trafficked victim i.e. they did not know that an act in section 3(2)PHTA had been committed in respect of CYT and/or did not know that CYT was a child at the material time, the respective charges against them would not stand.

##### Did Tan and/or Liew know that one of the acts in section 3(2) PHTA had been committed in respect of CYT?

#### An irresistible inference can be drawn that both Tan and Liew did have knowledge that an act in section 3(2) PHTA had been committed in respect of CYT

54     On the evidence, I was able to draw the irresistible inference that both Tan and Liew must have known that one or more of the acts in section 3(2) PHTA had been committed in respect of CYT.

55     On the evidence, there was a system as to how ladyboys from Thailand would come to Singapore to work, how they would get from Golden Mile to their place of accommodation and eventually begin work at 79A Rowell Road. There would be a signal given to the ladyboys, even the newcomers as to the time they could start work. They would walk to 79A Rowell Road in batches, and back to their hotel either in a taxi or on foot. In his police statement, Tan confirmed he did not have to make special arrangements for Thai male prostitutes to come to his brothel to work. He knew Thai male prostitutes would regularly turn up for work at his brothel and they would “_come on their own_” [^56]. When Tan took over 79A Rowell Road, he appeared to have adopted an entire system which was already in place of a regular supply of Thai male prostitutes who would ply their sex trade at 79A Rowell Road. CYT was one such Thai male prostitute, the key distinguishing feature being his young age of 16 years old.

56     Putting aside knowledge of CYT’s age and simply considering the circumstances in which Thai male prostitutes find their way to 79A Rowell Road, I agree with the Prosecution that Tan would have known that recruitment of male prostitutes must be taking place in Thailand in order for them to even know of sex-work opportunities in Singapore. Tan would also know that these Thai male prostitutes had to be transported or be transferred from Thailand to Singapore for prostitution. They would be received in Singapore and arrangements would be made for their accommodation. “_Newcomers_” would be brought to see Tan. Whilst they were at work at the brothel, Tan also rendered assistance to these prostitutes by alerting or shielding them from the police, or even evading arrests[^57]. CYT was one such Thai male prostitute that had come to work at 79A Rowell Road.

57     Liew, who worked at 79A Rowell Road for Tan, would similarly be aware that the male prostitutes, including CYT, were foreigners, having interacted with them[^58]. Like Tan, he would similarly have known that these Thai male prostitutes had to be transported or transferred from Thailand to Singapore for prostitution[^59]. He would have known that arrangements had been made for their travel from Thailand, in order for them to be able to find their way to Singapore, and specifically to 79A Rowell Road to work. He would also be aware that they were harboured since one of his duties was to warn the prostitutes of police checks[^60].

58     Given the system in place and their roles in the running of 79A Rowell Road, I agree with the Prosecution that an irresistible inference may be drawn of the fact that both Tan and Liew would have known that one or more acts of recruitment, transportation, transferring, harbouring or receipt had been committed in respect of the ladyboys who worked at the brothel, including CYT. It did not matter even if neither of them had engaged in these acts nor knew exactly who did these acts[^61].

##### Did Tan and Liew know that CYT was a child?

59     Notwithstanding I was satisfied that Tan and Liew would have the knowledge that an act of recruitment, transportation, transferring, harbouring or receipt had been committed in respect of CYT, they would only know that CYT was a trafficked victim, if it could be shown that they knew CYT was a child. I had to be satisfied that Tan and/or Liew did know that CYT was below 18 years of age at the material time (from whom they had received payment from, in connection with his actual sexual exploitation).

60     On this key ingredient of the charge against each Accused person, I found that Prosecution had failed to prove the requisite knowledge on the part of Tan and Liew, beyond a reasonable doubt.

#### No Actual Knowledge

61     There was no evidence before me to show that either Tan or Liew had actual knowledge that CYT was a child. CYT did not tell either of them his age; nor did any of the ladyboys working at 79A Rowell Road. There were no admission in any of the Accused persons’ police statements that they knew the age of CYT.

62     In his police statement (P12), Tan acknowledged that it was his responsibility to ensure that there are no underaged persons using his brothel as a working place but stated that he did not know that there was a 16 year old boy working at his brothel[^62]. Liew similarly stated in his police statement (P13) that he was not aware of any young or under-aged prostitute working along Rowell Road[^63]. In court, Tan and Liew maintained their ignorance of the age of CYT.

#### Were Tan and/or Liew wilfully blind to the age of CYT?

63     Prosecution argued that even if Tan and Liew did not have actual knowledge of CYT’s age, the evidence before the Court showed that both of them were wilfully blind to the fact that CYT was under 18 years of age.[^64].

64     In _Adili Chinuike Ejike v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 38</span> at \[47\], the Court of Appeal described the term “_wilful blindness_” as a “_mental state which falls short of actual knowledge, but nevertheless is held to satisfy the mens rea of knowledge because it is the legal equivalent of actual knowledge……..Therefore, an accused person who does not in fact know the true position but sufficiently suspects what it is and deliberately refuses to investigate in order to avoid confirmation of his own suspicions should, in certain circumstances, be treated as though he did know…..”._

65     Drawing on the principles established in the case of _Adili_, in order to establish “_wilful blindness_” [^65], Prosecution must prove the following:-

> 65.1     That Tan and Liew had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion_[^66]_, of the fact that CYT was below 18 years of age, to which they may be said to have been willfully blind to. In this regard:-

>> a)       Did Tan and Liew personally suspect that CYT was under-aged? What were their subjective states of mind? Did they deliberately choose not to investigate their suspicions?

>> b)       What is the degree of suspicion? The suspicion must be firmly grounded and targeted on specific facts as opposed to untargeted or speculative suspicion. The level of suspicion must have been such as to lead Tan and Liew to investigate further and this would necessarily entail that the facts in question must be facts “_in whose existence the individual has good reason to believe_”.

> 65.2     There must have been reasonable means of inquiry available to Tan and Liew, which if taken, would have led them to discovery of the truth:

> 65.3     Tan and Liew must have deliberately refused to pursue the reasonable means of inquiry available so as to avoid such negative legal consequences as might arise in connection with his knowing the fact:

>> a)       They must have deliberately refused – because that would distinguish it from recklessness;

>> b)       The Accused persons’ motivation behind their failure to inquire into the age of CYT is key; their refusal to inquire must have been motivated by a desire to deliberately avoid inculpatory knowledge;

>> c)       The refusal to inquire was borne out of a motive to avoid the legal liability which attaches to knowledge of the fact that the Accused persons blinded themselves to, and not out of, for example, negligence or indolence.

#### No clear, grounded and targeted suspicion

66     Prosecution’s evidence fail on this ground. On the evidence before me, I was not satisfied that Tan and/or Liew had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion that CYT was below 18 years of age. I was unable to find any circumstances which triggered such a suspicion or would cause them to personally suspect that CYT was below 18 years old.

67     CYT was introduced to Tan by his “_senior friends_” on his first day of work, along with other newcomers[^67]. This was a fact Tan admitted to in his police statement as well i.e. that the senior ones would bring the newcomers to him to let him know that they were there to work as well. Notwithstanding the introduction, it was CYT’s evidence that he did not speak to Tan personally during the five days when he worked at the brothel[^68]. He was never asked for his identification documents (passport or travel documents) and never asked for his age by Tan or Liew[^69]. There was also no evidence from CYT that he had ever hinted of his age to Tan or Liew.

68     As for the number of days of immigration stay he received, CYT testified that he could not remember whether Tan and Liew had ever asked him regarding that. There is no clear evidence that CYT brought Tan or Liew’s attention to the fact that he had only been issued a social visit pass for 7 days – a matter which would likely have put Tan and/or Liew on notice that something was amiss in respect of this particular male prostitute who had just started work at the brothel.

69     The only hint of evidence relating to a possible uncovering of CYT’s age came from PW3 Chutisara who testified that he saw Tan talk to CYT When asked whether he knew that Tan was walking to CYT about, his answer was: “_About the visa that I think have got 7 days_”_._ It was his evidence that the ladyboys talked amongst themselves about CYT’s visa being only for 7 days and they had suggested to CYT to talk to Tan to reduce the $50 that CYT had to pay each day[^70]. When asked in cross-examination if CYT had actually spoken to Tan about the reduction of rental, PW3 reiterated that he saw Tan and CYT speak to each other but he “_do not know what is the contents_”[^71]. PW3 could not be certain that CYT had spoken to Tan about reducing the rental (on the basis that CYT had only received 7 days social visit pass)

70     I find this piece of evidence from PW3 to be equivocal. CYT himself could not remember if Tan had asked him how many days immigration stay he had[^72]. In fact, there was nothing forthcoming from CYT about him having specifically told Tan and/or Liew about his visa being only for 7 days – a fact which most certainly would have alerted them to his possible status as a child. In fact, it is CYT’s own evidence in examination-in-chief that he did not have any conversation with Tan at all[^73].

71     Therefore, on the evidence before me, I was unable to find that neither Tan nor Liew had any basis to suspect that CYT was under 18 years old. CYT was brought in as a newcomer to the brothel, along with other newcomers who were adults, at the same time. As I observed, there was nothing in the physical appearance or physical attributes of CYT which would have raised a suspicion that he was a child. Rightfully, no submission was made by the Prosecution in this respect. In any case, CYT was only at the brothel for a period of 5 days and with limited interaction between CYT and Tan and Liew, it was not likely that any suspicion would have been raised as to the age of CYT.

72     The single line in Tan’s police statement that he knew about the under-aged male prostitute who was arrested in his brothel on 8 Dec 2017[^74] was insufficient for me to infer that Tan did know or had reason to suspect that there was an under-aged male prostitute at his brothel at the material time. He may have known that fact after he was arrested as explained later in the same statement[^75]. In all his police statements, Tan admitted that he did not check the passports of the ladyboys who worked at 79A Rowell Road; neither did he ask them for this age nor thought about verifying their age. He maintained that he did not know that any of the male prostitutes arrested at 79A Rowell Road was below the age of 18 years old.

#### Failure to check the passport and travel documents of CYT

73     Tan and Liew may at best, be described to be negligent, even reckless in failing to check the passport or travel documents of the ladyboys who entered the brothel (of which CYT would be one) but that does not, on its own, amount to wilful blindness. Tan and/or Liew must have personally suspected the fact in question i.e. CYT’s age. As emphasized in _Adili_, this would serve “_to distinguish the wilfully blind accused person from the negligent accused person, who might have subjectively have thought of nothing of circumstances that a reasonable person would have found suspicious_”. Wilful blindness is concerned with the subjective state of mind of the accused person, not the state of mind of a reasonable person and what a reasonable person would do[^76]. Tan and Liew must have personally suspected the truth about CYT’s age but deliberately chose not to investigate their suspicions.

74     What were the subjective minds of Tan and Liew? The evidence before the court is that Tan had taken over the business at 79A Rowell Road from Ong Ah. It is the Prosecution’s own case that Tan did not have to make special arrangements for Thai male prostitutes to come to the brothel to work and there appeared to be a system of supply of male prostitutes in place when he took over. These Thai male prostitutes would just turn up at 79A Rowell Road. This system of business, set in place even before Tan took over 79A Rowell Road may have lulled him, and consequently Liew who worked for Tan, into a state of complacency about the status of Thai male prostitutes, and along with that, the age of CYT, who came to the brothel as the others did. Hence, they did not check the passports, travel documents or even enquire about the ages and legality of the prostitutes who came into their brothel.

75     A clear, grounded and targeted suspicion must be directed at the age of CYT[^77], and not a general, speculative enquiry into the status of the Thai male prostitutes at the brothel. Given the subjective state of minds of the Accused persons and the state of evidence, it is clear that there were no circumstances which would have caused Tan and Liew to personally suspect the age of CYT when he came into the brothel along with the other newcomers, which would have led them to investigate further.

76     There was an admission by Tan in his police statement that he would ask the Thai prostitutes how many days visa they get from immigration. However, there is no clear evidence that Tan had asked CYT in this case such that he had a basis to personally suspect his age. There is also no evidence that Tan, as owner, or Liew, as caretaker, had a system of checking the ages and passports of the Thai male prostitutes who regularly came into the brothel such that when it came to CYT, they had deliberately refused, avoided or overlooked the checking of his passport and travel documents. Such facts would have warranted a deeper inquiry into the subjective state of minds of Tan and Liew.

77     In consideration of the totality of evidence, I was not satisfied that Tan and Liew had been willfully blind to the age of CYT at the material time. There was a reasonable doubt in this aspect of the Prosecution’s case.

#### A reasonable means of inquiry and a deliberate refusal to pursue the reasonable means of inquiry

78     Suffice to say, if Tan and Liew had a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion about CYT’s age, they would easily have a reasonable means of inquiry available to them, which if taken, would have led them to discover the truth of CYT’s age. They could have simply asked to see CYT’s passport. That would have immediately opened their eyes to the fact that CYT was a child, below 18 years of age. A deliberate refusal to check the passport in these circumstances, if shown to be motivated by a desire to avoid inculpatory knowledge, would likely amount to wilful blindness. However, there did not exist a clear, grounded and targeted suspicion in relation to CYT’s age to begin with.

## Conclusion

79     Tan and Liew’s testimonies were unbelievable in some aspects. In addition, their explanations for the content in their statements were far from satisfactory. The totality of their defence did not sufficiently throw doubt on a large portion of the Prosecution’s case. However, it is trite that deficiencies in the Prosecution’s case, in this instance, the element of knowledge that CYT was a child and thus a trafficked victim for purposes of the PHTA, cannot be made up for by weaknesses in the Defence’s case. Each facet of the Prosecution’s case must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, on the Prosecution’s own evidence, and this burden lies on the Prosecution from the start to the end of trial. There was no presumption to aid the Prosecution in this case.

80     Tan and Liew may perhaps be guilty of offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Cap 91A, or even the Immigration Act, Chapter 133. However, where this offence under the PHTA is concerned, whilst Prosecution has been able to prove most elements of the offence under section 6(1) of the PHTA, there was a reasonable doubt on the evidence as to whether both Tan and Liew knew that CYT was a child and therefore a “_trafficked victim_” for purposes of the PHTA, from whom they had received payment in connection with his actual exploitation.

81     Accordingly, I acquitted each of the Accused persons on their respective charges.
