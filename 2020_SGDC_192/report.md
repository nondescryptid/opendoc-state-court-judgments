Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Misuse of Drugs Act – Aggregate Sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9765/2020/01.\]

20 August 2020

### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, 60 years old, pleaded guilty to three charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”), Chapter 185:

> (a)      DAC 935551/2016 - for having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking two packets containing not less than 176.71g of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 6.96g of diamorphine;

> (b)      DAC 935556/2016 – for consuming a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, monoacetylmorphine, with enhanced punishment under Section 33A(2) of the said Act;

> (c)      DAC 935559/2016 – for consuming a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, methamphetamine, with enhanced punishment under Section 33A(2) of the said Act.

2       The Accused admitted to and consented to having seven other charges under the MDA taken into consideration.

3       I imposed a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment on each of the three proceeded charges, with two of the sentences ordered to run consecutively. The Accused was sentenced to a total of 16 years’ imprisonment. He is dissatisfied with the sentence and has appealed against it.

## Facts

### DAC 935551/2016

4       The Accused was arrested on 2 March 2016 by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”). On the same day, he was escorted to Block 5 Lorong 7 Toa Payoh, #XXX, Singapore. A search was conducted in the unit and two packets containing granular substances were seized. These two packets containing granular substances were analysed by Dr Zhang Shuhua from the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) and certified to contain a total of not less than 6.96 grams of diamorphine, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the MDA. Investigations revealed that the Accused had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.

### DAC 935556/2016

5       On the same day, the Accused’s urine sample was taken and sent to the HSA for analysis. The HSA analysts who conducted an analysis of the Accused’s urine samples subsequently issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA which certified that the Accused’s urine sample contained monoacetylmorphine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA.

### DAC 935559/2016

6       On a separate occasion on 9 April 2015, the Accused was arrested by CNB officers outside unit #XXX of Block 63, Lorong 5 Toa Payoh, Singapore. The Accused provided his urine samples which were sent to the HSA for analysis. The HSA analysts who conducted an analysis of the Accused’s urine samples subsequently issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA which certified that the Accused’s urine sample contained methamphetamine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule of the MDA.

7       Prior to the commission of both the offences of consumption of a specified drug, the Accused, was on 14 May 2008 in Subordinate Court No. 34, _vide_ DAC 20516/2008, convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, Norbuprenorphine, under Section 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA and punished under Section 33A(1) of the MDA with five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

9       For various periods from 1977 to 2011, the Accused was sent to the drug rehabilitation centres or placed under drug supervision.

## Mitigation

10     In mitigation, the Accused asked for the minimum sentences to be imposed on the charges. He told the Court that he had come to his senses and pleaded for a last chance, adding that he would not re-offend. The Accused highlighted that he was presently serving an eight-year imprisonment term which would run up to a total of 20 years if the court imposed the minimum sentence on his current charges.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

11     The Prosecution sought a term of eight years’ imprisonment on each of the three charges and submitted that an aggregate sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment would be the appropriate sentence.

## Decision on Sentence

### DAC 935551/2016 - Possession of 6.96 grams of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking

12     The minimum sentence prescribed for the offence of trafficking is five years’ imprisonment. The Accused would not be liable for caning since he was above 50 years old. The maximum sentence prescribed is 20 years’ imprisonment.

13     The amount of diamorphine concerned in this charge was 6.96 grams. Even though the weight of the drugs is not the only consideration when determining the appropriate sentence, the Court in the case of _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span>, made it clear that the quantity of drugs involved in a trafficking charge would have a strong bearing on the sentence to be imposed since the quantity of drugs would usually be proportionate to the harm and thus be a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the offence.

14     According to the sentencing framework set out in the case of _Vasentha_, the indicative starting point for a first offender trafficking in 5 to 7 grams diamorphine would be seven to eight years’ imprisonment, with caning. Given that the amount of drugs which the Accused had with him i.e. 6.96 grams of diamorphine was close to the upper limit of the band, it would warrant a sentence of about eight years’ imprisonment. Whilst I was mindful that the Accused had pleaded guilty, I noted that the Accused had another charge of trafficking in 34.31 grams of methamphetamine which had been taken into consideration. I was of the view that no adjustment to the indicative sentence was necessary and eight years’ imprisonment would be the appropriate sentence on this trafficking charge.

### DAC 935556/2016 and DAC 935559/2016 – Consumption of Monoacetylmorphine and Methamphetamine

15     The minimum sentence prescribed for the offence of consumption on each these charges is seven years’ imprisonment, with caning which again, the Accused would not be liable for. The maximum sentence prescribed is 13 years’ imprisonment.

16     I considered an uplift from the minimum sentence to be necessary in this case. As Prosecution pointed out, the Accused faced a total of four LT-2 consumption charges arising from two separate arrests, before me. Taking into account that there were these two other charges of consumption being taken into consideration, both of which carried long-term minimum sentences of seven years each, I did not consider it appropriate to impose the minimum sentence of seven years on the two consumption charges proceeded on.

### Aggregate Sentence

17     As required by section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), I ordered the sentences in two of the charges to run consecutively, namely DAC 93551/2016 and DAC 935556/2016. The aggregate sentence was 16 years’ imprisonment.

18     I took a last look at the sentence to ensure that it was not crushing or excessive. Upon doing so, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence was a fair sentence which commensurated with the Accused’s overall criminality and culpability.

19     The Accused was arrested on 9 April 2015 for offences of consumption, possession of methamphetamine and drug utensils. Notwithstanding the arrest, the Accused continued his deep association with drugs until he was re-arrested on 2 March 2016 for an even more serious offence of trafficking, along with additional consumption and possession of drug and drug utensils offences. Before me, the Accused faced a total of 10 charges and was currently serving an eight-year imprisonment sentence on another drug offence, imposed by the High Court. Apart from these matters, I also considered that the Accused had been spared caning, which would ordinarily have been imposed along with the sentence on the proceeded drug charges (each of which carried a minimum number of strokes), had he been below 50 years old. The Accused would certainly appreciate this, having suffered caning for his last consumption of drug offence.

20     In addition, I also ordered the term of 16 years’ imprisonment to begin immediately i.e. from 4 August 2020, and not upon the expiry of the current sentence. According to the prison memo dated 4 August 2020, the Accused’s earliest date of release for his current sentence was 2 July 2021; the latest date of release would be 1 March 2024.

21     All considered, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence of 16 years’ imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances.
