\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9072/2019/01.\]

12 April 2019

### District Judge John Ng:

The Offender, Wee Hong Da Gerald (male/23 years old/DOB:17 December 1995) pleaded guilty to one charge as follows:

“You are charged that that you, on 23 June 2017 at 3.23 am, did drive motor car, SFC9197P, along Kallang Paya Lebar Expressway, in a manner so rash as to endanger human life, _to wit_, by intermittently applying your breaks whilst the motor car SLH4404H (“the victim’s car”) was in front of you with only a car length’s distance between both cars, abruptly stopping your car in front of the victim’s car at the chevron markings before the tunnel, and then abruptly cutting in front of and into the lane of the victim’s car and abruptly slowing down your car, resulting in the victim’s car colliding into the rear of your car in the tunnel, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 279 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

2       The Offender was represented by counsel at the proceedings before me. After recording the Guilty Plea on the charge, I heard the submissions on sentence by the Prosecution and the plea of mitigation by the Defence before calling for a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) report under section 339(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68 (“CPC”) by the appointed psychiatrist. The appointed psychiatrist did not recommend MTO. The Offender was thereafter sentenced to imprisonment of 5 weeks and disqualified from holding a driving license for a period of 3 years with effect from the date of release from prison. The Offender is dissatisfied and his counsel has filed this appeal against Sentence. The Offender is on bail pending the hearing of this appeal.

## Summary of Facts

3       The Statement of Facts contained the full facts admitted to by the Offender. Briefly, this case arose from an encounter on the road between the Offender and the Victim on 23 June 2017 at 3.23 a.m. They were driving their respective cars inside a tunnel of the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (“KPE”). They were not known to each other. The Offender was driving his car on the right lane of a 2-lane road on KPE in the direction of the city. The Victim was driving ahead in his car on the left lane. The Victim’s car was abreast an unknown truck which was travelling on the right lane in front of the Offender’s car. The Offender had high-beamed at the Victim multiple times as he felt that the Victim was driving slowly.

4       At 3:24:01, the Offender overtook the Victim’s car. Whilst the Offender’s car was in front of the Victim’s car, the Offender applied his brakes intermittently while the Victim’s car was about one car length behind. The Victim high-beamed and sounded the horn at the Offender. The Offender rolled down his window and gesticulated at the Victim with his right hand. Thereafter, the Offender filtered from the left to the right lane. The Victim then drove parallel to the Offender. At 3:24:33 am, the Offender accelerated his car and filtered into the left lane in front of the Victim’s car. After speeding ahead, the Offender abruptly stopped next to the chevron demarcating the split roads between the KPE and the Pan Island Expressway (“PIE”) at 3:24:38 am. As a result, the Victim had to swerve to the left onto the chevron markings to avoid colliding into the Offender’s car at about 3:24:42 am. The Victim drove pass the Offender into the KPE tunnel on a single lane which led to a 3-lane road and then to a 4-lane road. The Offender followed the Victim. At about 3:26:05 am, the Offender cut from Lane 2 into Lane 3 at about 2 cars’ length away from the Victim’s car. The Offender then filtered into Lane 4 (which was a slip road to Sheares Ave). The Offender rolled down his window and gestured at the Victim with his right arm swinging out of the driver’s window. The Offender then abruptly cut into Lane 3 from Lane 4 and abruptly reduced the speed of his car. The Victim, who had been driving on Lane 3, applied his brakes but could not stop in time. Therefore, the Victim’s car collided onto the rear of the Offender’s car. Both cars stopped after the collision. The Offender alighted from his car and walked towards the Victim, gesturing angrily.

5       Following the incident, the Victim sought treatment from Raffles Medical Clinic. He was given 3 days of medical leave from 25 to 27 June 2017. The diagnosis was of sprain and strain of the cervical spine. The injury at the Victim’s spine was caused by the impact of the collision. The rear portion of the Offender’s car was damaged and the front portion of the Victim’s car was damaged.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

7       The Prosecution submitted that a short imprisonment term of at least 6 weeks would be appropriate punishment and Disqualification of 3 years for all classes of licence. The DPP tendered a table of sentencing precedents which showed a range of sentences of imprisonment of 8 weeks to 10 months for offences under Section 279 Penal Code, Chapter 224. Since the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed for this offence is one year, the sentencing precedents covered practically the whole spectrum.

8       The Prosecution proposed a sentencing matrix covering the sentencing factors of Harm and Culpability. In this case, the Harm was low and the Culpability was medium, therefore the suggested sentence was one of at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment. The DPP cited the case of _Public Prosecutor v Sim En De_ (“_Sim En De_”) in support of its calibration.

## Mitigation

9       The Defence Counsel pleaded for leniency for his client. His client had pleaded guilty to the charge and is remorseful. The written Mitigation Plea delved into much of the Offender’s medical and psychiatric history. Two reports – one by psychologist Dr Julia Lam and one by psychiatrist Dr Ng Koon Hock – were tendered in support of the Defence Counsel’s arguments for the calling of a MTO Suitability Report (hereinafter referred to as “the MTO Report”). In my decision to call for the MTO Report, I was guided by the very recent High Court case of _GCX v PP_ . The judgment was issued on 24 January 2019 by Justice See Kee Oon.

## The MTO Report

10     The MTO Report dated 11 March 2019 was submitted by Dr Pamela Ng, a Consultant at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). Dr Pamela Ng is an appointed psychiatrist under Section 339(13) of the CPC. She was of the opinion that the Offender is not a suitable candidate for a MTO.

## Reasons for the Sentence

11     The bone of contention in this case and the reason for the Defence Counsel lodging this appeal on behalf of his client is the dissatisfaction with the appointed psychiatrist’s conclusion that the Offender was not suitable to be placed on MTO.

#### The CPC Provisions on MTO

12     The MTO Report was called for under Section 339(2) of the CPC which provides as follows:

“s 339 – (2)    Before making a mandatory treatment order, the court must call for a report to be submitted by an appointed psychiatrist.”

13     On the conditions for the making of a MTO by the Court, it is provided in the CPC as follows:

“s 339 – (3)    A court may make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender only if the report submitted by an appointed psychiatrist states that –

(a)    the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment;

(b)    the offender is suitable for the treatment; and

(c)    the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his committing the offence.

(4)    A court must not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender if the report submitted by the appointed psychiatrist states that he is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c).

(5)    In assessing whether an offender is a person suitable for treatment for his psychiatric condition, the appointed psychiatrist may take into account the following factors:

(a)    whether the offender is likely to attend the treatment sessions on such day and at such time and place as the appointed psychiatrist may require;

(b)    the physical and mental state of the offender; and

(c)    the financial standing of the offender and his ability to pay all or any part of the costs of his treatment which it is reasonable for him to pay.”

14     It is undoubtedly clear from the aforesaid subsection (4) that a court **must not** make a MTO if the report states that the appointed psychiatrist is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c). In the present case, the appointed psychiatrist Dr Pamela Ng had given her opinion and stated unequivocally that the Offender is not a suitable candidate for a MTO at Paragraph 20 of her report.

15     It is obvious to me that the appointed psychiatrist had assessed the Offender, in accordance with subsection (5), to be a person not suitable for treatment after taking into account the factor in subsection (5)(a) that the Offender is not likely to attend the treatment sessions as required when Dr Pamela Ng observed at Paragraph 20 that “He does not seem to take responsibility of his own treatment. He does not know the name of the medication that he is taking and sometimes forgets to take it. He relies on his mother to remind him of the appointment dates.”

#### Prohibition of MTO under subsection (4)

16     In the light of Dr Pamela Ng’s observations and assessment (in accordance with subsection (5)(a)) and her opinion that she is not satisfied with the matter in subsection (3)(b), it is incumbent upon me, as prohibited by subsection (4), not to make a MTO in this case.

17     Finally, it is pertinent to note, as provided in Section 339(9) of the CPC, that:

“(9)- Any report made by the appointed psychiatrist shall be taken to be final and conclusive as to the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a), (b) and (c).”

18     On 1st April 2019, the DC informed the Court that the appeal was to question the appointed psychiatrist on the basis of her conclusion in the MTO Report that his client was not suitable for MTO. The DPP rightly pointed out that the Court was _functus officio_ at that stage and it is not permissible to allow the DC to seek clarifications from or make further enquiry of the appointed psychiatrist.

19     The DC was relying primarily on the case of _Low Gek Hong v PP_ (“_Low Gek Hong_”), in seeking to question the appointed psychiatrist. The DC is misconceived in staking this argument on the decision of _Low Gek Hong_.

20     In _Low Gek Hong_, Justice See was preserving the Court’s power to seek clarifications or make further enquiry if, and only if, the report was unclear or had drawn manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusions. In this case, there was no basis for the DC to say that Dr Pamela’s MTO Report was “unclear or had drawn manifestly wrong, illogical or absurd conclusions”. The DC might not share the observations, opinions and recommendations of the appointed psychiatrist, but that non-acceptance is insufficient to invoke the judicial power preserved by the High Court in _Low Gek Hong_.

21     From the High Court case of _Low Gek Hong_, there is an instructive note of caution expressed at Paragraph 16 of the judgement to avoid protraction of the sentencing process. Justice See Kee Oon held that:

“… the purpose of s 339(9) of the CPC in providing for his opinion to be “final and conclusive” is precisely to avoid or at least minimise the possible protraction of the sentencing process with satellite litigation aimed at challenging or re-interpreting what the psychiatrist has stated, or not stated, as the case may be.” (at Paragraph 16)

#### Calibration of the Sentence imposed

22     The DPP has submitted for an imprisonment term of at least 6 weeks as punishment for the Offender. I found that it was a reasonable calibration of the sentence to be imposed based on the Harm and Culpability factors. The harm caused was moderate in my view. The Victim had suffered sprain and strain of the cervical spine and he was given 3 days of medical leave. The injury at the Victim’s spine was caused by the impact of the collision. The rear portion of the Offender’s car was damaged and the front portion of the Victim’s car was also damaged. I also found the case of _Sim En De_ cited by DPP helpful as a reference for consideration of the sentence, in view of the similarities in that case and the present case. The offender in _Sim En De_ was sentenced to 8 weeks’ imprisonment and disqualification of 4 years for an offence under s279 PC.

23     In _Sim En De_, the offender Sim had pleaded guilty to a single charge of driving in a manner so rash as to endanger human life under s279 PC. While driving along the Central Expressway, Sim had deliberately encroached into the lane on which another motor car was travelling and caused a collision between the two cars. There was a dispute over a minor matter of water being sprayed from Sim’s car onto the windshield of the other car. This led to a series of moves between the two cars of speeding up and cutting in and out of each other’s lanes, accompanied by exchanges of gestures. It all culminated in an accident involving the two cars.

24     In passing the sentence, the District Judge in _Sim En De_ was of the opinion that the offence committed by Sim falls under a category of offences where offenders resort to extreme actions over motoring-related incidents. District Judge Adam Nakhoda held that:

“The circumstances of this case and the accused’s aggressive actions would, in my opinion, fit within the definition of “road rage”. _Public policy dictates that there should be no tolerance for road rage incidents_ that result in violence and I found that this policy should extend to incidents of road rage as described above. Therefore, for the reasons stated above, I found that _the offence committed by the accused can be considered serious and that such offences call for a deterrent sentence_.” (emphasis in _italics_ mine)

25     In _Sim En De_, Sim was diagnosed with a psychiatric condition but the District Judge held that it was clear to him that Sim’s mental disorder did not have an effect on the commission of the offence.

26     Although the Offender was not suitable for MTO to be imposed, I decided that the psychiatric conditions of the Offender found in the psychological report of Dr Julia Lam, the psychiatric report of Dr Ng Koon Hock and the MTO Report could be taken into account in attenuating the culpability of the Offender in the commission of the serious offence he had pleaded guilty to.

## Conclusion

27     In essence, the DC is challenging the basis of the appointed psychiatrist for her recommendation that MTO is not suitable for the Offender in this case. By the clear wording of the CPC provisions for the MTO regime, in particular s339(4) and s339(9), where the appointed psychiatrist is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c) there is no discretion for a MTO to be imposed by the Court.

28     The sentence imposed for the offence committed by the Offender in this case, in the absence of the MTO option, reflects his overall criminality and are in line with sentencing precedents.
