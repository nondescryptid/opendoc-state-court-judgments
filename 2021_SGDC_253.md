Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Misuse of Drugs Act Prisons Act Penal Code – Multiple Offender

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9249/2021/01.\]

12 November 2021

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Mohamed Rizal Bin Salim (male/40), pleaded guilty to and was convicted of four charges for offences of a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition under the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed), repeat consumption of a specified drug (“LT2 offence”), giving false information and using abusive words towards a public servant. He admitted to two charges for failure to report for urine tests and consented to them being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing on the four convicted charges. He was sentenced to a total imprisonment of 7 years, 1 month and 548 days, and caning of 6 strokes. The sentence was backdated to take effect from the date of his arrest on 5 October 2020. The Accused has filed an appeal against the sentence.

## Summary of the Statement of Facts

2       The Accused was released from prison on 23 May 2020. He was placed on conditional remission from 23 May 2020 to 27 February 2022 and was subject to mandatory aftercare conditions. He committed a serious breach of the mandatory aftercare condition on 26 August 2020 and he committed various other offences on 5 and 6 October 2020.

### Brief facts for the offence of a serious breach of mandatory aftercare condition

3       On 26 August 2020 at 10.00 p.m., the Accused had failed to return to Selarang Halfway House (“SHH”) upon expiry of his approved time-off. On 28 August 2020 at 5.32 p.m., the Operations Manager of SHH lodged a police report against the Accused for failing to remain indoors for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours. The Accused had breached curfew for a total cumulative period of 925 hours and 43 minutes between 26 August and 5 October 2020.

### Brief facts for the consumption of a specified drug (“LT2 offence”)

4       On 5 October 2020, at about 5.13 a.m., officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) raided a flat unit and arrested the Accused. Two urine samples were obtained from the Accused and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. These urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”).

5       The Accused admitted to abusing “ice” which is the street name for methamphetamine. He had relapsed to consuming “ice” since July 2020 on a daily basis using the “chase” method.

### Brief facts for the offence of giving false information

6       On 4 October 2020, at about 6.14 p.m., the former girlfriend of the Accused had lodged a police report against the Accused for harassment. As mentioned earlier, the Accused was subsequently arrested by CNB officers for drug offences on 5 October 2020.

7       After the arrest, the Accused falsely informed the CNB officers that his former girlfriend had instructed him to pick up and deliver five packets of methamphetamine to her flat unit. The false information led to the arrest of his former girlfriend for suspected drug offences and the seizure of a packet. The seized packet turned out to be a packet of salt and not controlled drugs. The Accused subsequently admitted that he had given the false information as he was angry with her for reporting to the police on his whereabouts. The Accused had also admitted to placing the plastic bag containing the packet of salt outside the former girlfriend’s flat unit to pass off as controlled drugs.

### Brief facts for the offence of using abusive words towards a public servant

8       On 6 October 2020 at about 9.29 p.m., a CNB officer had a telephone conversation with the Accused. During the conversation, the Accused vented his frustration on the CNB officer and used abusive words in Malay towards her. On 7 October 2020 at 5.25 p.m., the CNB officer lodged a police report that the Accused had used vulgarities against her in the telephone conversation.

## Sentence passed

9       After recording the Guilty Plea on the four charges, I heard the respective submissions on sentence by the Prosecution and the Plea of Mitigation by the Defence. The Offender was sentenced as follows:

## Submissions on sentence

11     The sentencing positions of the Prosecution and the Defence were fairly similar. In fact, they had proposed the same sentences for three of the four charges proceeded with. The DPP and the DC submitted for the mandatory minimum imprisonment of 7 years and 6 strokes of caning for the LT2 drug consumption offence. As for the enhanced sentence under Section 50T of the Prisons Act, both agreed that 264 days of imprisonment would be appropriate.

12     Both submitted the same 284 days of imprisonment for the offence of a serious breach of the mandatory aftercare condition. For hurling vulgarities at the public servant, the suggested sentence by both parties was one week’s imprisonment.

13     The parties only had a slightly different position for the sentence of the offence of providing false information to a public servant. The DPP submitted that a sentence of at least 5 weeks of imprisonment is warranted. The DC suggested that the sentence should be no more than 3 weeks of imprisonment.

## Reasons for the Sentence

14     Before I proceed to elucidate the basis for each of the sentences passed, it is important to point out that at the end of the day, this Court had to arrive at a total sentence which was commensurate with the gravity of the offences and the circumstances by which they were committed and bearing in mind the type of offender before me.

### Sentence for the LT2 drug consumption offence

15     The Accused is a repeat offender for the consumption of specified drugs. Based on his previous conviction for LT1 drug consumption, the Accused must be sentenced to at least an imprisonment term of seven years and six strokes of the cane for the LT2 drug consumption offence.

### Sentence for the offence of furnishing false information

16     The dominant sentencing principles for this offence in this case are Deterrence and Retribution. The Accused had not only lied to the CNB officers, he had also planted the packet of salt to simulate a packet of drugs in order to frame his former girlfriend. This action of his made his lies more believable and convinced the CNB officers to take the enforcement actions against the victim of his lies. She was arrested, subjected to a urine test and suffered a short detention at the CNB due to his false information. In the light of the circumstances and serious consequences, a custodial sentence of imprisonment of one month is fully justified.

### Sentence for the offence of using abusive words towards a public servant

17     The proposed sentence of one week’s imprisonment by the Prosecution and Defence for this offence is reasonable and was accepted by the court. In any event, this sentence was ordered to run concurrently with the other sentences of imprisonment.

### Sentence for the offence under section 50Y of the Prisons Act

18     Both the DPP and DC submitted for a sentence of 284 days for the offence of the serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition. I found their submissions to be in line with the guidance from the High Court on sentencing such cases and accepted the recommended 284 days of imprisonment to be imposed.

19     The guideline judgment is found in the case of _Abdul Mutalib Bin Aziman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (“_Abdul Mutalib_”) which laid down the sentencing framework in determining the sentence for the serious breach of mandatory aftercare conditions under Section 50Y Prisons Act and the determination of an enhanced sentence under Section 50T of the Prisons Act. The following are the key aspects:

> (a)     The gravity of the offence committed while on remission.

> (b)     The rehabilitative prospects of the offender.

> (c)     All other relevant circumstances.

A sentencing banding matrix was provided for the purpose of calibrating the sentence to be imposed as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="14.5865078265688%"> <col width="19.6287574456296%"> <col width="65.7847347278016%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of severity</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range (based on the remaining duration of the remission order)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 1/3 or [1% to 33%]</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1/3 to 2/3 or [33% to 66%]</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2/3 to the full remaining duration</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

20     Based on the above table, the court is to further identify the appropriate degree of severity within a particular sentencing band – the low end, mid-point or upper end of Bands 1, 2 or 3. Finally, endeavour to arrive at a fraction or percentage of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the relevant offence.

21     The main sentencing factors in this case that placed the Accused within the high degree of severity of Band 3 are:

> a.     The Accused had committed the serious breach for a total of 925 hours and 43 minutes. This places the offence at the grave end of the scale for such offences.

> b.     The Accused breached the remission order after about three months from his release from prison. The Accused also committed fresh offences. He did not return to SHH voluntarily but were arrested. Such circumstances showed that the Accused has very poor rehabilitative prospects.

22     Based on the aforesaid assessment, a reasonable calibration would be at the start of Band 3 which is two-thirds of the remaining duration. The maximum remaining duration of the remission order available to be considered for punishment, as at the date of the offence, is 549 days. Two-thirds of 549 days would yield 366 days. A further adjustment to 284 days is warranted in view of the enhanced sentence of 264 days under section 50T Prisons Act.

### Calibration of the Enhanced Sentence under section 50T Prisons Act

23     The Accused is a repeat offender for the consumption of specified drugs. Based on his previous conviction for LT1 drug consumption, the Accused had to be sentenced this time to the mandatory minimum of 7 years of imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The Accused had also committed the LT2 drug offence during his remission period under the Conditional Remission System and therefore had breached the basic condition of the Conditional Remission Order. He was therefore liable for an enhanced sentence of up to 512 days which is the remaining duration of his remission period.

24     Based on the factors mentioned above for this case, I am satisfied that the case falls within Band 3 of the sentencing framework of _Abdul Mutalib_. Calibrating the enhanced sentence at two-thirds of 512 days would be 340 days. In order not to breach the **outer limit** stipulated in the case of _Abdul Mutalib_, an enhanced sentence of 264 days (which is reduced from the 340 days so as not to breach the outer limit of 549 days) in view of the 284 days already calibrated for the offence under s50Y Prisons Act.

25     Therefore, the sum of the sentence for the offence under s50Y and the enhanced sentence under s50T of the Prisons Act is a total of 548 days.

### Running of the terms of imprisonment

26     The Prisons Act mandates that the enhanced sentence under section 50T and the sentence for an offence under section 50Y must all run consecutively to any other sentences of imprisonment imposed on the Accused.

27     As for the running of the sentences for the LT2 offence, the offence of giving false information and the use of abusive words against the public servant, the guideline judgment is the case of _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>.

28     The DC rightly acknowledged that in the present case, the one-transaction rule was not applicable as the offences committed by the Accused occurred in distinct transactions. Therefore, I ordered that the sentences for the LT2 drug offence and the offence of giving false information to a public servant to run consecutively. Only the imprisonment term for the offence of using abusive words against a public servant is to run concurrently.

## Conclusion

29     The sentences imposed had taken into account the mitigating factor of the Accused pleading guilty which is a sign of remorse. The court had also noted the letters he had written from remand prison. These letters contained his plans to marry his girlfriend and to take care of his children aged 13, 17 and 18. He expressed his determination not to re-offend and to avoid taking drugs. These are good intentions and it is hoped that he will be committed to them for the sake of his family.

30     The total sentence in this case was imposed in view of all the similar sentencing factors submitted by the Prosecution and the Defence. I have considered the factors carefully and applied them accordingly - both individually and collectively. I was also mindful of the Totality Principle and taken one last look and found no basis to scale down the overall sentence.
