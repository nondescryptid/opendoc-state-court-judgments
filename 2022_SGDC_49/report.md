### District Judge Lim Mei Yee Elaine:

1       The present case arises out of an employment dispute between the plaintiff and his former employer, the defendant. Following his summary dismissal from the defendant’s employment, the plaintiff commenced this Suit, claiming the repayment of various loans he had made to the defendant, wrongful suspension without pay, wrongful termination, and salary in lieu of unconsumed annual leave. The defendant counterclaimed for various breaches of the plaintiff’s implied duties as employee, overpayment of the plaintiff’s salary and expenses, and negligent misrepresentation.

2       After considering the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I allow the plaintiff’s claim in part in the sum of S$79,847.62 and the defendant’s counterclaim in part in the sum of S$33,849.52. Thus, a net amount of S$45,998.10 is found to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff. These are the reasons for my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

3       The plaintiff was the defendant’s Director – Corporate Advisory between June 2017 and November 2019.[^1] The defendant terminated the plaintiff’s employment sometime in November 2019.

4       The defendant is a local company founded in June 2014 by Dr Deborah Elms (“Dr Elms”) to serve as a bridge between companies and governments on trade and trade policy.[^2]

5       From the founding of the defendant until August 2019, Dr Elms was its sole shareholder and director. In August 2019, Dr Elms sold 30% of her shares in the defendant to Elizabeth Maude Marie Rankine (“Ms Rankine”). Ms Rankine became a director of the defendant from 27 August 2019.[^3]

### Background to the dispute

#### The terms of the plaintiff’s employment and the scope of his responsibilities

6       The plaintiff does not have a written contract of employment with the defendant.[^4] While the exact terms of his employment and the scope of his responsibilities in the defendant are disputed, the parties agree at least on the following matters.

7       It was Dr Elms who interviewed and employed the plaintiff on behalf of the defendant. Dr Elms and the plaintiff agreed that his monthly salary would be S$10,000, that he would be entitled to 21 days of annual leave, and that while he was employed by the defendant, he could continue to maintain his business interests in Logisym Limited (“Logisym”) on the side.[^5] Subsequently, there were revisions to the plaintiff’s monthly salary such that by September 2019, his monthly salary was S$8,800.[^6]

8       In the course of his employment with the defendant, the plaintiff performed, among other things, the following roles:

> (a)     the plaintiff made business and/or management and/or administrative decisions on behalf of the defendant on the occasions where Dr Elms was travelling or unavailable;[^7]

> (b)     the plaintiff was made a co-signatory of the defendant’s bank account a few months after he joined the defendant;[^8]

> (c)     the plaintiff was involved in human resource (“HR”) matters: he interviewed several potential employees and interns for the defendant, assisted in preparing the first written contract of employment for the defendant, and terminated a few of the defendant’s employees;[^9] and

> (d)     the plaintiff assisted the defendant in navigating certain local issues, such as engaging with the Registrar of Societies to register an association, the Asian Trade Business Association (“ABTA”).[^10]

#### The establishment of ABTA

9       In 2017, the plaintiff, Dr Elms and various other individuals founded ABTA. The purpose of ABTA was broadly to help drive trade policy across Asia by being a link or bridge between governments and companies for creating and implementing trade policy.[^11] The plaintiff was the Secretary General of ABTA.[^12]

10     ABTA had various members who would assist in driving its agenda. The members paid annual membership fees to ABTA. Amazon and Amazon Web Services (collectively “Amazon”) was a member of ABTA from April 2018 to March 2020, but did not renew its membership in ABTA in 2020.[^13]

11     ABTA paid secretariat fees to the defendant in 2018 and 2019.[^14]

#### Loans extended by the plaintiff to the defendant

12     In the course of his employment, the plaintiff extended various loans to the defendant. The following are the loans which are the subject matter of dispute in this Suit:[^15]

13     Of the combined loan principal of S$115,000 for the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan, S$70,000 remains unpaid to-date.

#### Payments made by the defendant and Dr Elms to the plaintiff in respect of the Cars

14     Dr Elms’ Toyota Prius was due to be scrapped in early 2019.[^16] In or around January 2019, the plaintiff assisted Dr Elms to purchase two cars: SJL 478Z for the personal use of Dr Elms’ family, and a company vehicle for the defendant’s use (collectively, the “Cars”). The Cars were registered in Dr Elms’ name.[^17]

15     The defendant and Dr Elms paid the plaintiff various sums totalling S$62,205.17 for the Cars.[^18]

#### The defendant’s move to 142 Neil Road

16     The defendant’s office was originally located at 41A Ann Siang Road (the “Previous Premises”). The monthly rent of these premises was S$6,500.[^19]

17     In the first half of 2019, the defendant began looking for a bigger office space to accommodate all its activities, which included workshops and other meetings for the defendant, ABTA and ABTA’s small business wing, Asia Pacific MSME Trade Coalition (“AMTC”).[^20]

18     On 15 June 2019, Dr Elms found online a shophouse at 142 Neil Road (the “New Premises”) which could potentially serve as the defendant’s new office. The asking monthly rent was S$18,000. The New Premises had four storeys and a basement. As the defendant did not require that much space, its intention, in the event it were to lease the New Premises, was to sublet two floors (the “vacant floors”) as office space.[^21]

19     On 12 July 2019, the defendant entered into a tenancy agreement to lease the New Premises from 15 September 2019 for a term of three years, at a monthly rent of S$15,000 (the “Tenancy Agreement”). The plaintiff signed the Tenancy Agreement on behalf of the defendant.[^22] However, the Tenancy Agreement did not permit subletting except with the express written consent of the landlord.[^23] The defendant eventually did not sublet the vacant floors.

20     In August 2019, the defendant moved into the New Premises after renovating them. As part of the move, the defendant prematurely terminated its lease of the Previous Premises and paid a break lease fee of S$19,500.

#### Events leading to the plaintiff’s suspension

21     On 13 September 2019 at about 2.15pm, the plaintiff had a call with Amazon’s Quint Simon (“Quint”) and Andrew Harris (“Mr Harris”). During the call, Quint informed the plaintiff that:[^24]

> (a)     on a previous occasion when he gave her a lift back to her office after an event, he had made certain comments about the work culture of the Emiratis, namely that they were lazy;

> (b)     she was uncomfortable with those comments and had reported them internally. After internal discussions, Amazon decided not to renew their membership in ABTA.

22     Later that afternoon at about 4pm, Amazon’s representatives informed Dr Elms over a separate telephone call that they would be withdrawing their support from ABTA and would not be renewing their membership in ABTA, in light of certain racially insensitive comments the plaintiff had made to one of their staff, which they had deemed inappropriate.[^25]

23     On 16 September 2019, Dr Elms and Ms Rankine met with the plaintiff to discuss Amazon’s withdrawal of support from ABTA (the “16 September Meeting”). During the meeting, Dr Elms informed the plaintiff that he was placed on administrative leave immediately while they looked into the matter, and that they would reconvene on 20 September 2019 to discuss the next steps.[^26]

24     On 20 September 2019, Dr Elms, Ms Rankine and the plaintiff met again (the “20 September Meeting”). Dr Elms requested the plaintiff to resign immediately. However, the plaintiff refused to do so until he was paid all that was allegedly due to him. The parties then discussed when various payments would be made by the defendant to the plaintiff. The call concluded with the parties agreeing that in the meantime, they would tell the other employees that the plaintiff was on leave.[^27]

25     On 16 October 2019, the defendant’s solicitors, Changaroth Chambers LLC (“CCL”), issued a letter to the plaintiff (the “16 October Letter”):[^28]

> (a)     setting out alleged misconduct on his part which the defendant had uncovered in the course of its investigations; and

> (b)     stating that he would be placed on further suspension without pay until the defendant’s investigations were completed and the defendant had made a decision as to termination of his employment.

#### The termination of the plaintiff’s employment

26     By a Notice of Termination dated 11 November 2019 (the “Notice of Termination”), CCL informed the plaintiff that he had been terminated from the defendant’s employment with effect from 7 November 2019.[^29]

27     The defendant did not pay the plaintiff any salary on or after 1 October 2019.[^30]

#### The plaintiff’s claims in the TADM and the Employment Claims Tribunals

28     On 26 September 2019, the plaintiff filed a claim against the defendant in the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (“TADM”) for, among other things, unpaid salary and salary in lieu of unconsumed annual leave.[^31] As parties were unable to reach a settlement through mediation, the plaintiff then commenced ECT/11095/2019 for reimbursement of expenses he had incurred while carrying out official duties with the defendant, unpaid salary, salary in lieu of notice and salary in lieu of unconsumed annual leave. The plaintiff withdrew this claim in December 2019.[^32]

29     On 15 January 2020, the plaintiff filed a second claim against the defendant in the TADM, for mostly the same heads of losses. As parties were again unable to settle the claim through mediation, the plaintiff commenced ECT/10137/2020 for unpaid salary, salary in lieu of notice and salary in lieu of unconsumed annual leave (the “ECT Claim”).[^33]

30     By an order of court made on 23 June 2020, the ECT claim was consolidated with this Suit.[^34]

## The parties’ cases

### The claim

31     The plaintiff claims the sum of S$97,431.05, interest and costs against the defendant. The sum comprises of four heads of losses:

> (a)     the outstanding principal of the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan in the sum of S$70,000, and an additional sum of S$2,227 as compensation for bank charges which he had allegedly incurred in extending these loans to the defendant;[^35]

> (b)     unpaid salary during the period of his suspension from 1 October 2019 to 11 November 2019, in the sum of S$11,733.33;[^36]

> (c)     one month of salary in lieu of notice for the period 12 November 2019 to 11 December 2019, in the sum of S$8,800. Alternatively, two weeks of salary in lieu of notice, pursuant to section 10 of the Employment Act (Cap. 91, 2009 Rev Ed) (the “EA”);[^37] and

> (d)     salary in lieu of 11.5 days of unconsumed annual leave, in the sum of S$4,670.72.[^38]

32     The defendant admits that S$70,000 of the principal amount of the 1 July Loan is outstanding. However, the defendant denies that the 12 July Loan is outstanding, or that it had agreed to pay an additional sum of S$2,227 to the plaintiff in respect of the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan.[^39]

33     The defendant also denies that the plaintiff is entitled to salary for the period 1 October 2019 to 11 November 2019.[^40]

34     The defendant contends that it was entitled to terminate the plaintiff’s employment without any notice, in light of his misconduct as set out in \[4.1\], \[4.2(b),(c),(e)\], \[4.3\], \[4.5\] and \[4.7\] of the 16 October Letter. Moreover, there are no written or implied terms of the plaintiff’s employment obliging the defendant to pay salary in lieu of notice. The plaintiff is therefore not entitled to one month salary in lieu of notice for the period 12 November 2019 to 11 December 2019.[^41]

35     The defendant disputes the plaintiff’s claim for salary in lieu of unconsumed annual leave on the ground that he had overused three days of leave. This means that the defendant had overpaid his salary instead.[^42]

### The counterclaim

36     The defendant contends that the plaintiff, as an employee, owed the defendant an implied duty of good faith and fidelity and an implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence in performing his duties as employee (collectively, the “Implied Duties”).[^43]

37     The defendant counterclaims against the plaintiff for the following:

> (a)     S$10,500, being overpayment of the 2 May Loan and 29 March Loan made to the plaintiff, in breach of his Implied Duties;[^44]

> (b)     S$42,405.17, being excessive payments for the Cars which the plaintiff had authorised from the defendant’s bank account without the defendant’s approval, in breach of his Implied Duties;[^45]

> (c)     S$109,876.90, being the losses suffered by the defendant in its move to the New Premises, arising from:[^46]

>> (i)       the plaintiff’s negligent misrepresentations to Dr Elms that the vacant floors could be sublet, which were relied upon by the defendant and induced the defendant to lease the New Premises; and

>> (ii)       the plaintiff’s breach of his Implied Duties in causing the defendant to enter into a lease which did not permit subletting except with the landlord’s consent, and in failing to obtain the landlord’s consent to sublet the vacant floors;

> (d)     US$97,500 in losses suffered by the defendant due to the loss of Amazon as its client and a member of ABTA as a result of the plaintiff’s breach of his Implied Duties;[^47]

> (e)     S$4,400, being overpayment of the plaintiff’s salary for the period 15 to 30 September 2019, during which he was suspended without pay;[^48]

> (f)     S$33,520.40, being the excessive amount of salary and expenses which the plaintiff had paid himself from the defendant’s bank account.[^49]

38     The defendant seeks to set off against the plaintiff’s claim, any sums found to be due to it under its counterclaim.[^50]

39     The plaintiff concedes that he owes the defendant the Implied Duties, However, he disputes the counterclaim primarily on the following grounds:

> (a)     there was no overpayment of the 2 May Loan and the 29 March Loan. The additional S$500 repaid for the 2 May Loan was paid pursuant to Dr Elms’ suggestion, as reasonable compensation for bank charges which the plaintiff had incurred, and/or loss of interest which the plaintiff would otherwise have earned, for the period of the loan. The quantum of the 29 March Loan is S$20,000, and not S$10,000;[^51]

> (b)     all payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff for the Cars were made with Dr Elms’ knowledge and authority;[^52]

> (c)     the defendant had moved into the New Premises at Dr Elms’ express instructions. The plaintiff denies that he had made any misrepresentations to the defendant which induced it to lease the New Premises, or that he had breached his Implied Duties insofar as the New Premises are concerned;[^53]

> (d)     Amazon had only terminated its relationship with ABTA: it did not terminate its working relationship with the defendant. Moreover, Amazon’s decision to terminate its relationship with ABTA was not caused by the plaintiff’s comments to Quint. In or around June 2019, Amazon had already informed the defendant in writing of its decision to complete their existing commitment with ABTA and review any further commitment with the defendant. Furthermore, ABTA is not a party to this suit and it is not admitted that the defendant served as ABTA’s secretariat;[^54]

> (e)     it is denied that the plaintiff had paid himself excessive salary and expenses from the defendant’s bank account.[^55]

>> (iii)       if Issues 8(i) and/or (ii) are answered in the affirmative, whether that had caused the defendant to suffer loss of income of at least US$97,500.

## Issue 1: Whether the defendant had agreed to pay the plaintiff an additional sum of S$2,227 for the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan

41     Under section 103 of the Evidence Act (Cap, 1997 Rev Ed), the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the defendant had agreed to bear any additional bank charges which he incurred as a result of extending the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan, and that such bank charges amount to S$2,227.

42     The plaintiff relies mainly on two pieces of evidence to prove his claim:[^56]

> (a)     the transcripts of the 20 September Meeting, which show that Dr Elms and Ms Rankine had admitted that S$72,227 was the amount due to the plaintiff for his loans to the defendant; and

> (b)     the plaintiff’s handwritten note to Ms Rankine on his Easicredit Statement of Account dated 31 July 2019, in which he instructed her to “Pls try and pay this asap so that we do not incur more interest”, coupled with the absence of any contemporaneous correspondence from the defendant to question his aforesaid instruction to Ms Rankine.

43     In my judgment, the evidence is insufficient to discharge the plaintiff’s burden of proof.

#### The defendant’s admission at the 20 September Meeting that S$72,227 was owed to the plaintiff for his loans

44     I begin with Dr Elms and Ms Rankine’s admission at the 20 September Meeting that S$72,227 was the amount due to the plaintiff for his loans to the defendant. At trial, Dr Elms testified that she had made that admission because as far as she knew at that time, S$72,227 was the amount due. She was not aware that the figure included bank charges until the plaintiff commenced this Suit, and she had never agreed with the plaintiff that the defendant would bear such bank charges. Moreover, it was only when the defendant subsequently investigated into the figure that they discovered, among other things, that the bank charges were in fact attributable to two loans – a S$50,000 withdrawal on 8 July 2019, and a S$35,000 withdrawal on 12 July 2019 – of which only the latter was extended to the defendant.[^57] In a similar vein, Ms Rankine testified that at the time of the 20 September Meeting, she had thought that S$72,227 was the agreed amount before the defendant investigated the matter further.[^58]

45     It is unclear from the above testimony of Dr Elms and Ms Rankine on what basis they had believed, as at 20 September 2019, that S$72,227 was the amount owing to the plaintiff for the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan. Nonetheless, upon considering all the evidence on this issue in totality, I am satisfied that there was no agreement that the defendant would bear any bank charges which the plaintiff had incurred as a result of extending the loans, and that Dr Elms and Ms Rankine had been mistaken during the 20 September Meeting that the amount owed for the loans was S$72,227. This is for the following reasons.

46      **First**, the plaintiff’s evidence on the circumstances leading up to the conclusion of the alleged agreement, and the quantum of the bank charges, is internally and externally inconsistent, and contrary to the inherent probabilities, in several ways.

47     The key premise of the plaintiff’s claim for the bank charges is that the defendant had agreed to fully repay _both_ the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan by 26 July 2019, but had failed to meet this repayment deadline.[^59] Such failure caused the plaintiff to incur bank charges, as he could not use the anticipated repayments to service his OCBC Easicredit overdraft, which he had drawn down on to extend a S$50,000 loan to his sister on 8 July 2019 as well as the 12 July Loan. Thus, he approached Dr Elms and Ms Rankine, who agreed that the defendant would bear any bank charges that he had incurred as a result of extending the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan.[^60]

48     In my view, the plaintiff has not established this key premise of his claim. While it is undisputed that the defendant had agreed to repay S$16,000 of the 1 July Loan by 17 July 2019 and the remaining S$64,000 of that loan by 26 July 2019,[^61] there is no credible evidence that the defendant had also agreed to repay the 12 July Loan by 26 July 2019.

> (a)     The plaintiff has simply made a bare assertion that he and Dr Elms had agreed that the 12 July Loan would be repaid by 26 July 2019.[^62] He did not provide any details on when and how such an agreement had been concluded, or adduce any documents which evidenced such an agreement.

> (b)     The defendant’s need for the 12 July Loan was raised and agreed upon in emails exchanged between the plaintiff, Ms Rankine and Dr Elms from 10 to 12 July 2019.[^63] There is no mention of the deadline for repayment of the loan in those emails.

> (c)     If there had been an agreement that the 12 July Loan would be repaid by 26 July 2019, one would expect the plaintiff to refer to it when demanding repayment of the loan. This was not the case. In the plaintiff’s email to Dr Elms and Ms Rankine on 20 September 2019 at 10.26am,[^64] he asserted that the defendant had missed the payment deadlines for the 1 July Loan, and appended Ms Rankine’s email of 1 July 2019 to Dr Elms which set out these deadlines. However, he did not make a similar assertion that the defendant had promised, but failed, to repay the 12 July Loan by 26 July 2019. Instead, he simply stated that his repeated requests for full repayment of both loans had not been met.

49     Furthermore, it is undisputed that the bank charges of S$2,227 included interest which the plaintiff would have incurred even if the defendant had repaid the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan according to the alleged deadlines.[^65] This is because:

> (a)     even if the defendant had repaid S$16,000 to the plaintiff by 17 July 2019, the plaintiff would still have incurred interest on the S$50,000 and S$35,000 withdrawals from the time they were withdrawn from the Easicredit account until 17 July 2019; and

> (b)     since the two withdrawals totalled S$85,000, a S$16,000 repayment by 17 July 2019 would only have partially settled the withdrawals. Interest would continue to run on the outstanding amount of the withdrawals until the defendant had fully repaid the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan by 26 July 2019.

50     On the plaintiff’s own admission, such interest would be his personal problem, and not the defendant’s problem.[^66] I therefore find it inherently improbable that the plaintiff would have requested the defendant to bear such interest and that the defendant would have agreed to such a request.

51     In addition, the plaintiff’s explanation for the quantum of the bank charges is contradicted by the objective evidence. The plaintiff asserted in his AEIC that the total bank charges he incurred in extending the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan to the defendant amounted to S$2,227 as of 30 September 2019.[^67] At trial, he explained that the bank charges had stopped at S$2,227.16 because there were no further bank charges to be paid after his sister repaid the S$50,000 which he had loaned her and the defendant repaid a total of S$15,000 on 3, 5 and 6 September 2019.[^68]

52     However, this explanation flies in the face of the plaintiff’s bank statements. As seen from the plaintiff’s Easicredit Statement of Account dated 31 July 2019, his account went into overdraft in the region of S$85,000 after he withdrew the sums of S$50,000 and S$35,000 on 8 and 12 July 2019 respectively.[^69] While numerous deposits were subsequently made into the account, his Easicredit Statement of Account dated 30 September 2019 shows that his account was _still_ in overdraft as of that date – albeit at a lesser sum of S$42,984.03 – and interest continued to be incurred on the overdraft.[^70] It is not the plaintiff’s case that between 13 July 2019 and 30 September 2019, he had made further drawdowns on the overdraft. Thus, the only reason his account was still in overdraft as of 30 September 2019 must be that the two withdrawals in July 2019 had not been fully repaid with interest. This casts serious doubt on his explanation for the quantum of the bank charges, and by extension, his claim that there was an agreement that the defendant would bear such bank charges in the first place.

53      **Second**, there is no objective evidence that the plaintiff had informed Dr Elms or Ms Rankine, at any time prior to the commencement of this suit, that bank charges were included in the figure of S$72,227. Even when the plaintiff brought up the figure of S$72,227 at the 20 September Meeting, he had simply mentioned that this was the outstanding loan amount without clarifying that it included bank charges of S$2,227.[^71]

54     The plaintiff submits that Ms Rankine had confirmed in cross examination that the sum due for his loans was S$72,227 inclusive bank charges. He relies on this alleged confirmation to support his argument that at the time of the 20 September Meeting, the defendant was already aware that bank charges were included in the S$72,227. I am unable to accept this submission. Ms Rankine was simply conceding that when she and Dr Elms had acknowledged at the 20 September Meeting that S$72,227 was owed to the plaintiff for his loans, the acknowledgement would naturally extend to whatever bank charges the plaintiff had included in that figure.[^72]

55     In the premises, I find that Dr Elms and Ms Rankine were not aware that the figure of S$72,227 included bank charges until they had sight of the Statement of Claim filed in this Suit on or about 26 November 2019. Once they discovered from the Statement of Claim that the figure included bank charges, they promptly took the position in the initial Defence and Counterclaim that there was never any agreement that the defendant would bear such bank charges.[^73]

#### The plaintiff’s handwritten note on his Easicredit Statement of Account

56     I now turn to the plaintiff’s handwritten note on his Easicredit Statement of Account dated 31 July 2019. In my view, when one reads the note in the context of the Statement of Account, it simply shows the plaintiff’s instruction to Ms Rankine to repay the 12 July Loan (which loan was reflected in the Statement of Account) as soon as possible, to avoid incurring more interest in the account. The note does not refer to the 1 July Loan, much less any agreement that the defendant would bear the bank charges incurred by the plaintiff in extending the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan. In the premises, it does not support the plaintiff’s case that there was such an agreement.

57     I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s assertion that he did not mention the alleged agreement in his note because he was then still working for the defendant and did not want to take a hard line.[^74] If the plaintiff had referred to the alleged agreement in his note, that would have conveyed his intention to minimise the amount of bank charges which the defendant would allegedly have to compensate him for. It is difficult to see how that would have antagonised the defendant or strained the parties’ relationship.

#### Conclusion

58     Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover only S$70,000, and not S$72,227, in respect of the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan.

## Issue 2: Whether the plaintiff was wrongfully suspended without pay for the period 1 October 2019 to 11 November 2019

59     On the issue of wrongful suspension, the points of contention between the parties are as follows:

> (a)     first, whether the defendant was entitled to suspend the plaintiff without paying him for the period 1 October 2019 until the date of his termination; and

> (b)     second, whether the date of the plaintiff’s termination was 7 November 2019 (as alleged by the defendant) or 11 November 2019 (as alleged by the plaintiff).

60     In relation to the first point of contention, the plaintiff submits that under section 14(8) of the EA, the defendant was only entitled to suspend the plaintiff for one week on half pay. The defendant was therefore obliged to pay his salary during the period of his suspension, less half a week of salary.[^75]

61     I accept the plaintiff’s submission. In common law, an employer has no implied right to suspend the employee without pay for breach of duty as this may not be reflective of the actual damages incurred. A right to suspend without pay has to be expressly included in the contract: Ravi Chandran, Employment Law in Singapore, 6th ed (LexisNexis, 2019) (“Employment Law in Singapore”) at \[6.108\]. It is not the defendant’s case that it had an express or implied contractual right to suspend the plaintiff without pay. Thus, the question of whether the defendant was entitled to suspend the plaintiff without pay is governed by the EA.

62     Under section 14(8) of the EA, any suspension for the purpose of an inquiry into misconduct cannot exceed one week or such longer period as the Commissioner may determine on the application of the employer, and the employer must pay the employee at least half the employee’s salary during the permissible period of suspension. It is not the defendant’s case that it had applied to the Commissioner for permission to suspend the plaintiff for a period longer than one week. Thus, I find that the defendant is only entitled to suspend the plaintiff for one week, and must pay the plaintiff at least half of his salary for that one week.

63     I reject the defendant’s submission that it was entitled to suspend the plaintiff without pay until the date of his termination because the inquiry into misconduct took far longer than anticipated.[^76] The defendant did not provide any legal basis for its submission which is, in any event, contrary to section 14(8) of the EA.

64     The resolution of the second point of contention turns on whether I accept Dr Elms’ evidence that the defendant had informed the plaintiff of the termination of his employment at the TADM mediation on 7 November 2019.[^77] I accept her evidence. The parties’ attendance at TADM on 7 November 2019 was referenced in the opening paragraph of the Notice of Termination. The plaintiff has not provided any reasonable explanation for why the defendant would choose to backdate his termination to 7 November 2019 as opposed to some other date, if the defendant had not communicated its decision to terminate the plaintiff at the TADM mediation on that day.

65     The plaintiff submits that it was impossible for the defendant to have terminated the plaintiff’s employment on 7 November 2019 without written notice because that would be in contravention of section 10(5) of the EA.[^78] I am unable to accept this submission. It is clear from section 10(1)-(4) of the EA that the entire section applies where one party purports to terminate the employment contract by giving notice. Section 10 does not apply in the present case where the defendant had purported to summarily dismissed the plaintiff for repudiatory breach of his employment contract.

66     In the premises, I find that the plaintiff was wrongfully suspended without pay from 1 October 2019 to 7 November 2019, which is a period of one month and a week. He is entitled to one month and half a week of salary for that period. This works out to damages in the sum of S$9,847.62, comprising of:

> (a)     S$8,800 for his October 2019 salary, and

> (b)     S$1,047.62 for half a week (ie, 2.5 days) of salary in November 2019. This is calculated on the basis that his per day wage that month is S$8,800 divided by 21 working days.

## Issue 3: Whether the plaintiff was wrongfully terminated

67     The defendant submits that it was entitled to terminate the plaintiff’s employment without notice on account of the following breaches of his Implied Duties which amounted to a repudiation of his employment contract:[^79]

> (a)     the plaintiff had made racially insensitive and derogatory comments to an Amazon employee and several of the defendant’s employees and interns;

> (b)     the plaintiff had failed to carry out his work with due diligence by:

>> (i)       failing to accurately keep accounting records and deliver such records to the defendant’s staff when requested;

>> (ii)       holding up written contracts of employment for the defendant’s employees, including Mr Sebastian Cortes-Sanchez (“Mr Sanchez”), for no apparent reason;

>> (iii)       adding Au Kah Soon (“Mr Au”) to the defendant’s CPF payroll without the defendant’s approval, causing it to disburse S$8,800 in CPF contributions to Mr Au from April to July 2019;

> (c)     the plaintiff had engaged in work that did not relate to the defendant’s work scope during office hours and had involved the defendant’s employees in such work; and

> (d)     the plaintiff had asked Ms Inkar Aitkuzhina (“Ms Aitkuzhina”), who was then an intern of the defendant, to write and co-publish an article with him during office hours. Ms Aitkuzhina had written the article herself. However, the plaintiff eventually published the article solely under his name in the August edition of Logisym Magazine without informing Ms Aitkuzhina.

68     It falls to be determined:

> (a)     whether the plaintiff is guilty of the alleged misconduct;

> (b)     whether the said misconduct (if any) amounted to a repudiation by the plaintiff of his employment contract;

> (c)     in the event the plaintiff was wrongfully terminated, the quantum of damages he is entitled to.

### (a)   Whether the plaintiff is guilty of the alleged misconduct

#### Whether the plaintiff had made racially insensitive and derogatory comments to an employee of Amazon

69     I find that the plaintiff had made racially insensitive comments to Amazon’s Quint, to the effect that Emiratis were lazy. In cross examination, the plaintiff admitted that a few weeks prior to 13 September 2019, he had given Quint a lift to her office after their attendance at an event. During the lift, he had made comments to Quint about Emiratis and their work culture, specifically that they were lazy.[^80] His testimony is corroborated by the following documents, whose authenticity and truth of contents are undisputed:

> (a)     In his WhatsApp messages to Ms Rankine on 14 and 15 September 2019, the plaintiff stated that Quint had informed him that Amazon would be withdrawing their support from ABTA and would not be renewing their ABTA membership, in light of comments he had made on Emiratis and their work culture while giving her a lift a few weeks earlier.[^81]

> (b)     In his email to Dr Elms and Steve Okun on 16 September 2019 at 10.35am, the plaintiff stated that during his call with Quint and Mr Harris on 13 September 2019, Quint had informed him that when he gave her a lift to Amazon’s offices a few weeks earlier, he had made comments about what he thought of working with Emiratis in the Emirates / Middle East which made her feel uncomfortable. Quint stated that she had raised those comments internally within Amazon, and Amazon had decided to withdraw their support from ABTA and not to renew their membership in ABTA.[^82]

70     The plaintiff contends that the making of these comments did not breach his Implied Duties. He had made the comments to Quint in his personal capacity. Moreover, the comments were not related to his responsibilities as an employee of the defendant, not least because Amazon was a client of ABTA and not the defendant.[^83]

71     I reject this contention. For the reasons explained below, I am of the view that the plaintiff had breached his implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence in making such racially insensitive comments to Quint.

72     The evidence clearly shows that ABTA had no staff and that it was run largely by the defendant’s employees, including the plaintiff:

> (a)     The plaintiff himself testified that ABTA had no staff: it was run by a mixture of the defendant’s employees (including himself) and various other individuals.[^84]

> (b)     In the plaintiff’s email to Dr Elms on 26 February 2019 at 10.55pm, he commented, in relation to a data stewardship workshop to be held on 12 March 2019, that they should not take the lead but let Citi do so instead, and that “this is also a great opportunity _to de-couple ABTA and ATC \[ie, the defendant\] otherwise the former cannot grow_” (my emphasis).[^85] In a similar vein, when the plaintiff emailed the draft minutes of a meeting of ABTA’s digital taxation sectoral group to Dr Elms and various other individuals on 5 July 2019 at 9.05am, he commented that the “_Bottom line is that the groups \[ie, the sectoral groups in ABTA\] need to become more self-driven and member led and ATC staff to be less involved in driving the agenda._” (my emphasis).[^86]

> (c)     The defendant’s internal email correspondence shows that its employees (including the plaintiff) were doing work for ABTA, for example, drafting and/or reviewing policy briefs,[^87] and charting out deliverables and objectives for projects.[^88]

> (d)     ABTA’s Engagement Programme: Proposal on Handling of Digital Products Across Borders (Indonesia) dated 2 October 2018 states that the defendant serves as the secretariat for ABTA in Singapore.[^89] ABTA’s annual profit and loss statements for the years 2018 and 2019 show that ABTA paid the defendant substantial secretariat fees.[^90] Dr Elms had explained in her affidavit and at trial that the basis for the payment of such fees was that the defendant’s employees were running ABTA’s activities and programs.[^91]

> (e)     The authenticity and truth of contents of the emails, the proposal and the profit and loss statements cited in the preceding subparagraphs are not disputed.

73     Furthermore, the evidence demonstrates that the plaintiff saw his responsibilities in ABTA as part of his job scope in the defendant. The plaintiff testified that in the course of his employment with the defendant, he had assumed responsibilities beyond his original job scope, “just like with any other job you take on more responsibilities when your boss asks you to”.[^92] These responsibilities included engaging with the Registrar of Societies to register ABTA based on Dr Elms’ instructions, which he had done together with another colleague Minh Hue Nguyen (“Ms Minh”).[^93] There is no reason to believe that the plaintiff had thought differently about his responsibilities in ABTA. It is undisputed that in the case of employees who had joined the defendant after the plaintiff did, and who did work for ABTA, their written employment contracts with the defendant expressly stated that their duties included ABTA activities.[^94] An example of this can be seen in Clause b of Ms Fong’s employment contract with the defendant.[^95] The plaintiff was involved in preparing this employment contract, which was used as a template for the employment contracts of other employees.[^96] This reinforces my view that the parties regarded the plaintiff’s responsibilities in ABTA as part of his job scope with the defendant.

74     In the premises, I accept the defendant’s case that the plaintiff’s implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence extended to the discharge of his responsibilities in ABTA.[^97]

75     I find that the proper discharge of the plaintiff’s responsibilities in ABTA required him to behave appropriately in front of ABTA’s clients, even outside work. It is well settled that wrongful conduct outside work may justify summary dismissal: Employment Law in Singapore at \[6.125\] – \[6.128\]. As held in _Smith v The Christchurch Press Co Ltd_ \[2001\] 1 NZLR 407 at \[25\]:

> It is not so much a question of where the conduct occurs but rather its impact or the potential impact of the conduct on the employer’s business, whether that is because the business may be damaged in some way; because the conduct is incompatible with the proper discharge of the employee’s duties; because it impacts upon the employer’s obligations to other employees; or for any reason it undermines the trust and confidence necessary between the employer and employee

76     In the present case, the plaintiff’s interactions with ABTA’s clients, whether during or outside work, had the potential to affect ABTA’s business relationship with the clients. His implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence therefore required him to refrain from making racially insensitive comments to ABTA’s clients which might damage ABTA’s business relationship with them.

77     Hence, while the plaintiff had made the racially insensitive comments to Quint in his personal capacity, I find that such conduct amounted to a breach of his implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence.

#### Whether the plaintiff had made racially insensitive and derogatory comments to the defendant’s employees

78     The defendant relies on the affidavit evidence of Mr Sanchez, Ms Tee Jia Hui (“Ms Tee”) and Ms Annie Fong (“Ms Fong”) to demonstrate that the plaintiff had made racially insensitive and derogatory comments.[^98] Their affidavit evidence is summarised below.

79     Mr Sanchez gave evidence that the plaintiff would often use sexist and racist rhetoric within the office.[^99]

> (a)     On multiple occasions, the plaintiff had used racial slurs when referring to people of Middle Eastern, Indian and African American origin. For example, the plaintiff had used the word ‘nigger’ even after Mr Sanchez (who personally identified himself as being of Afro descent) had informed him on multiple occasions that the word made him feel uncomfortable.

> (b)     In one instance, the plaintiff repeatedly sang a lynching song during a staff meeting.

> (c)     The plaintiff had also made sexist comments to, and used sexually explicit language with, female interns on multiple occasions. Between May and July 2019, several female interns approached Mr Sanchez to raise concerns about the plaintiff’s behaviour and their overall level of discomfort working around him.

80     Ms Tee gave evidence that the plaintiff had made a racially insensitive joke on ‘yellow fever’ to Mr Sanchez, in the presence of herself and Ms Rankine. Specifically, when Mr Sanchez asked the plaintiff whether he needed to take a yellow fever shot before his travels, the plaintiff replied to ask him whether he had broken up with his girlfriend who was of Chinese origin.[^100]

81     Ms Fong gave evidence that the plaintiff had emotionally abused an intern, Mr Chen Qi Hang (“Mr Chen”), to the point where he resigned a few weeks into his internship. Ms Fong only learnt of the full extent of the emotional abuse when Mr Chen resigned and expressed his grief to her prior to leaving the office. Moreover, even after Ms Fong left the defendant’s employ, the plaintiff threw a balled-up sheet of paper at her during the Innovest Unbound Conference in June 2019.[^101]

82     In my judgment, only one of these racially insensitive and derogatory comments, namely the plaintiff’s ‘yellow fever’ joke to Mr Sanchez, has been proven. I accept Ms Tee’s evidence regarding this joke as it was not challenged by the plaintiff, who had agreed to the admission of her AEIC into evidence without the need to cross examine her.[^102]

83     I find that the defendant is not entitled to rely on the rest of the racially insensitive and derogatory comments set out in \[79\] and \[81\] above. In order for the plaintiff to have proper notice of the case he had to meet, the defendant had to provide particulars of each of these comments in its pleadings. The defendant failed to do so.

> (a)     The only racially insensitive and derogatory comments that were particularised in the defendant’s pleadings were the ‘yellow fever’ joke to Mr Sanchez, and the plaintiff’s alleged statement to Ms Aitkuzhina that “you are a Muslim woman from Kazakhstan, you should know your place” (which the defendant ultimately did not rely on).[^103]

> (b)     Leaving aside those particulars, the defendant’s pleadings had simply referred to the 16 October Letter,[^104] which made the following general allegations of racially insensitive and derogatory comments:

>> (i)       “racially insensitive and derogatory comments” to the defendant’s employees, including Mr Sanchez, Ms Minh and Barath Harithas, “about their races”: see \[4.1(b)\] of the letter; and

>> (ii)       “unpleasant repeated racial comments made in the workplace environment”, which were witnessed or experienced by Mr Chen and Ms Aitkuzhina: see \[4.1(d)\] of the letter.

> Such vague allegations do not give the plaintiff proper notice of the case he had to meet.

84     Furthermore, the defendant did not cross examine the plaintiff on the racially insensitive and derogatory comments set out in \[79\] and \[81\] above. The plaintiff therefore had no reasonable opportunity to respond to those alleged comments, and would be irreparably prejudiced if I were to permit the defendant to rely on the same.

85     I now turn to whether the plaintiff’s racially insensitive joke on ‘yellow fever’ to Mr Sanchez amounted to a breach of his Implied Duties. It is the unchallenged evidence of Mr Sanchez, Ms Tee, Ms Fong and Mr Lee Le Hua Andrew (“Mr Lee”) that the plaintiff was in charge of managing and supervising the defendant’s employees, including but not limited to delegating tasks to the employees and reviewing content deliverables that required Dr Elms’ final approval.[^105] Given this aspect of the plaintiff’s responsibilities in the defendant, I find that his implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence required him, all the more so, to treat his fellow employees with due respect. This entailed refraining from making racially insensitive comments to fellow employees. The plaintiff had breached this implied duty in making the racially insensitive ‘yellow fever’ joke to Mr Sanchez.

#### Whether the plaintiff had failed to carry out his work with due diligence

##### (1)   Whether the plaintiff had failed to accurately keep accounting records and deliver such records to the staff when requested

86     The defendant submits that the plaintiff’s duties included managing the defendant’s finances, which in turn involved the proper filing of accounting records. In this regard, it is the unchallenged affidavit evidence of Dr Elms and Ms Rankine that the defendant’s accounting records were not properly kept. Instead, such records were stuffed into two plastic bags that were only uncovered during the defendant’s move to the New Premises. That the plaintiff had left these critical documents in plastic bags is a clear breach of his implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence.[^106]

87     In my judgment, although the plaintiff’s duties included managing the defendant’s finances, it is unclear that he was at fault for the failure to properly keep accounting records. I elaborate on this below.

88     At trial, Dr Elms candidly admitted that she was not great at managing finances, and so prior to hiring the plaintiff, she had hired two women – Nina, followed by Caroline Verily (“Ms Verily”) – to manage the defendant’s bank accounts and HR matters. When Ms Verily left the defendant’s employ, the plaintiff took over her duties full time. Thus, the plaintiff had control of the defendant’s bank account, and was able to make i-banking transactions and issue cheques in relation to the account.[^107] In this regard:

> (a)     Much of the defendant’s business was conducted by way of cheques instead of i-banking. The plaintiff had instructed other employees to pay certain bills and to prepare cheques for him to sign. He signed every cheque for the defendant. Dr Elms did not sign any cheques for the defendant until after the plaintiff was suspended.[^108]

> (b)     Up to the time the plaintiff was suspended, he had the only bank token for the defendant’s bank account. He was granted the token shortly after he joined the defendant or when Ms Verily left, and his token was only deactivated after his suspension. The defendant procured bank tokens for Dr Elms and Ms Rankine only after the plaintiff was suspended.[^109]

> (c)     Therefore, up to the time the plaintiff was suspended, all SMS messages regarding movements in the defendant’s bank account would have been sent to his handphone number. The plaintiff did not forward all such SMSes to Dr Elms. Occasionally, the plaintiff would ask Ms Rankine or others about such an SMS, but he would not ask Dr Elms.[^110]

> (d)     The plaintiff did not have to seek Dr Elms’ approval for any dealings with regard to the defendant’s bank accounts.[^111]

89     I find Dr Elms’ evidence to be credible for the following reasons.

> (a)     It is undisputed that prior to hiring the plaintiff, Dr Elms had hired other people, such as Ms Verily, to manage the defendant’s finances.

> (b)     On the plaintiff’s own evidence, after Ms Verily left, the only employees besides Dr Elms were himself, Ms Minh (a young 23 or 24 year old Vietnamese lady) and Ingrid Cariou (a part timer French lady). Dr Elms often was not in the office as she spent a significant portion of her time travelling for work.[^112] Thus, I find it more likely than not that the plaintiff – being the next most senior person in the defendant after Dr Elms – took over the role of managing the defendant’s finances, and Dr Elms exercised very little supervision over this aspect of his work.

> (c)     Dr Elms’ evidence is corroborated by Ms Rankine, Ms Tee, Mr Sanchez and Ms Fong. These employees and/or former employees of the defendant gave evidence that the plaintiff was the defendant’s primary operations officer handling all financial activities and he would, among other things, instruct the defendant’s employees to prepare cheques, sign all cheques on behalf of the defendant, and approve expense claims / reports and payroll.[^113]

> (d)     While the plaintiff claimed that all transactions involving the defendant’s funds required Dr Elms’ approval which was obtained via WhatsApp (primarily), SMS, email or verbally,[^114] he was unable to point to any documentary evidence of him seeking her approval for such transactions.

90     I also accept the unchallenged affidavit evidence of Dr Elms and Ms Rankine that the defendant’s accounting records were not properly kept, but were instead stuffed into two plastic bags.

91     However, I am not satisfied that the failure to properly keep accounting records was attributable to the plaintiff. Dr Elms had testified that the accounting records in the plastic bags were receipts.[^115] No evidence was led from the defendant’s witnesses to show what was the company’s usual procedure in relation to the proper keeping of such receipts and how the plaintiff had failed to discharge his responsibilities in the context of that procedure.

92     Accordingly, the defendant has not proven that the plaintiff had breached his Implied Duties by failing to accurately keep accounting records and to deliver such records to the staff when requested.

##### (2)   Whether the plaintiff had held up written contracts of employment for the defendant’s employees

93     The defendant contends that the plaintiff was involved in ensuring that its employees had written employment contracts. By his own admission in cross examination, the plaintiff was involved in designing the defendant’s compensation package for its employees, and he had helped to prepare the first written employment agreement for the defendant.[^116]

94     The defendant relies on the affidavit evidence of Dr Elms and Mr Sanchez to show that the plaintiff did not deliver written employment contracts to some of its employees.[^117] In this regard:

> (a)     Dr Elms gave evidence that although the plaintiff had showed her drafts of employment contracts for the defendant’s employees, she subsequently discovered during the investigations into the plaintiff’s misconduct that the final versions of the contracts were not sent to the employees.[^118]

> (b)     Mr Sanchez gave evidence that the plaintiff was his point of contact for the negotiation and renewal of his employment contract which would expire in August 2019. After they had reached an agreement on 8 July 2019 on the terms of renewal of Mr Sanchez’s employment, the plaintiff told Mr Sanchez that he would draft the contract. However, the plaintiff failed to do so, despite repeated requests from Mr Sanchez.[^119]

95     On the other hand, the plaintiff testified that it was the defendant’s administrative executives (ie, one Ingrid, followed by one Chitra, and then followed by Ms Rankine) who would draft employment contracts.[^120]

96     In my judgment, the plaintiff was responsible for ensuring that the defendant’s employees had written contracts of employment.

97     At the time the plaintiff joined the defendant in June 2017, Ms Verily was in charge of finance and administration, but she resigned a few months later in December 2017.[^121] Dr Elms testified that when Ms Verily resigned, the plaintiff took over her duties, which included HR management, full time.[^122] I accept Dr Elms’ testimony. As I have earlier found in \[89(b)\], at the time Ms Verily left, the only employees besides Dr Elms were the plaintiff, Ms Minh and Ms Ingrid Cariou, and Dr Elms often was not in the office as she spent a significant portion of her time travelling for work.[^123] In the premises, it is more likely than not that the plaintiff also became the person in charge of HR in the defendant. This is underscored by the plaintiff’s concession in his pleadings that he had, on Dr Elms’ instructions, made management and/or administrative decisions on behalf of the defendant, including negotiating and approving the employment of employees and interns.[^124]

98     My view is reinforced by the affidavit evidence of the following employees and/or former employees of the defendant, which were not challenged through cross examination. In this regard:

> (a)     Mr Sanchez gave evidence that the plaintiff approved the selection of the defendant’s interns and set the amount of internship stipend, most of the time without consulting Dr Elms; that the plaintiff was his point of contact for the negotiation and renewal of his employment contract in August 2019 and had promised to draft his contract; and that the plaintiff approved his annual leave applications.[^125]

> (b)     Ms Rankine gave evidence that on 1 October 2018, the first day of her employment in the defendant, the plaintiff had directed her to type out her own contract of employment and had signed it.[^126]

> (c)     Ms Tee gave evidence that during her internship with the defendant from January to July 2019, she heard Mr Sanchez asking the plaintiff whether there was a need to obtain Dr Elms’ approval or input before decisions were made, and that the plaintiff’s response was that only research matters would go to Dr Elms while he was in charge of the rest.[^127]

> (d)     Ms Fong gave evidence that throughout the course of her employment with the defendant in 2018, the plaintiff acted as the primary operations officer for the defendant who handled, among other things, all HR activities including recruitment and employee management.[^128]

99     The evidence of these employees and/or former employees paint a consistent picture that the plaintiff was in charge of HR management in the defendant, and that this entailed (among other things) ensuring that the defendant’s employees had written employment contracts, whether or not the plaintiff chose to draft those contracts himself or to assign another employee to do so.

100    I now turn to whether the plaintiff had failed to ensure that the defendant’s employees had written employment contracts. Based on Mr Sanchez’s unchallenged evidence set out at \[94(b)\] above, I find that the plaintiff had failed to ensure Mr Sanchez had a written employment contract, and had thereby breached his implied duty to exercise reasonable skill and diligence. That, however, is the full extent of the plaintiff’s failure. Apart from Mr Sanchez, no other employee or former employee of the defendant gave evidence that they did not receive written employment contracts owing to the plaintiff’s conduct.

##### (3)   Whether the plaintiff had added Mr Au to the defendant’s CPF payroll without the defendant’s approval

101    It is undisputed that Mr Au had been added to the defendant’s CPF payroll and that the defendant had disbursed CPF contributions to Mr Au. The points of contention between the parties are as follows:

> (a)     as a preliminary issue, whether the defendant had withdrawn its pleadings in relation to Mr Au;[^129]

> (b)     whether the plaintiff had arranged for Mr Au to be added to the defendant’s CPF payroll; and

> (c)     if so, whether the plaintiff had done this without the defendant’s approval.

102    On the preliminary issue, I find that the defendant has properly pleaded its case that the plaintiff had added Mr Au to its CPF payroll without its approval. In \[23.3\] of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 4), the defendant stated that the misconduct set out in the 16 October Letter forms the basis of the termination of the plaintiff’s employment. \[4.5\] of the 16 October Letter in turn sets out brief details of the plaintiff’s inappropriate engagement of Mr Au.[^130]

103    Turning to the substance of the matter, Dr Elms and Ms Rankine gave evidence that during the defendant’s investigations into the plaintiff’s misconduct, they discovered that he had added Mr Au to the defendant’s CPF payroll without Dr Elms’ approval. His purpose of adding Mr Au to the defendant’s CPF payroll was to enrol Mr Au in a Professional Conversion programme and to apply through the defendant for a government grant for the said programme. To that end, the plaintiff had instructed Ms Rankine to submit the application for the government grant. However, Ms Rankine did not submit the application as she suspected that the defendant had not approved it.[^131]

104    The plaintiff’s case is that the defendant had approved the addition of Mr Au onto its CPF payroll. In gist, the plaintiff testified that:[^132]

> (a)     Mr Au was the chairman of AMTC. Dr Elms had wished to hire him as an employee of the defendant, so that he could help to run activities and projects for AMTC. Thus, Dr Elms and the plaintiff spoke to Mr Au about becoming a full-time employee of the defendant, and interviewed him. Dr Elms, Ms Rankine and the plaintiff were all involved in the defendant’s hiring of Mr Au and payment of CPF contributions to him.

> (b)     Mr Au had a deal with Dr Elms that the defendant would not, by virtue of bringing him onto its payroll, be out of pocket, and that if the defendant needed Mr Au to pay anything, he would issue payment. However, the plaintiff is not aware what exactly this deal and the ‘out of pocket’ was about.

> (c)     The defendant ultimately did not employ Mr Au, which was why it applied for a refund of the CPF contributions it had made to Mr Au.

> (d)     The plaintiff is unsure whether he was the person who had arranged for the defendant to pay the CPF contributions to Mr Au: he could have done so.

105    I find that the plaintiff had arranged for Mr Au to the defendant’s CPF payroll, without Dr Elms’ approval. The evidence of Dr Elms and Ms Rankine as set out in \[103\] above was not challenged in cross examination. Moreover, their evidence is corroborated by the defendant’s application to the CPF on 22 October 2019 for a refund of CPF contributions paid in error to Mr Au.[^133] By contrast, the plaintiff’s testimony that the defendant had approved the addition of Mr Au onto its CPF payroll is not credible for several reasons.

106    First, if the plaintiff’s testimony were true, one would expect him to have explained, in his AEIC, how he, Dr Elms and Ms Rankine were involved in the defendant’s hiring of Mr Au and payment of CPF contributions to him. However, his AEIC was silent on this issue.

107    Second, in WhatsApp messages on 26 April 2019, the plaintiff informed Ms Rankine that he had spoken to Mr Au, and that if the defendant needed Mr Au to pay for anything, she could simply let Mr Au know and he would issue payment (the “first statement”).[^134] The plaintiff also told Ms Rankine that the deal was that the defendant would not be out of pocket but needed to get Mr Au on the payroll as soon as possible (the “second statement”).[^135] When the plaintiff was cross examined on what these statements meant, his answers kept changing and were inconsistent:

> (a)     When asked what the first statement meant, the plaintiff initially claimed that it was a conversation that he and Dr Elms had with Mr Au that the defendant was supposed to bring him on the payroll.[^136]

> (b)     But when the plaintiff was pressed further on why he made the first statement, he changed his tune and alleged that it was an agreement Dr Elms had made with Mr Au, the exact nature of which he could not recall.[^137]

> (c)     In light of the plaintiff’s claim that he could not recall what exactly was the agreement between Dr Elms and Mr Au, he was asked “how is it that you know this”. He then asserted that the WhatsApp messages arose due to a misunderstanding between Ms Rankine and Mr Au, which prompted him to call Mr Au to ask what was going on. Mr Au had told the plaintiff that “he will settle it”, which was why the plaintiff sent the first statement to Ms Rankine.[^138] However, the plaintiff’s assertion that Ms Rankine and Ms Au had a misunderstanding was not reflected anywhere in the WhatsApp messages, a fact which the plaintiff ultimately conceded.[^139]

> (d)     When queried further about the alleged misunderstanding between Ms Rankine and Ms Au, the plaintiff explained that it happened quite often because Mr Au would ask the staff to do work but the staff would not do so.[^140] This explanation does not make sense as the WhatsApp messages did mention any instructions given by Mr Au to the defendant’s staff. Rather, the WhatsApp messages were essentially an instruction from the plaintiff to Ms Rankine that she could approach Mr Au to make payments for the defendant.

> (e)     When asked what the phrase “out of pocket” in the second statement meant, the plaintiff claimed that he did not know what it was, because this was a deal which Mr Au had with Dr Elms.[^141] This contradicts the plaintiff’s earlier testimony that the defendant was allegedly supposed to apply for a grant for Mr Au to work for the defendant.[^142]

108    It is established law that one aspect of an employee’s implied duty of good faith and fidelity is that he must not make use of his employer’s property for his own purposes. Misappropriation of the employer’s property therefore constitutes a breach of that implied duty: Employment Law in Singapore at \[5.18\] – \[5.20\]. In the premises, I find that the plaintiff had breached that implied duty in arranging for Mr Au to be added to the defendant’s CPF payroll without the defendant’s approval.

##### (4)   Whether the plaintiff had engaged in work unrelated to the defendant’s work scope

109    There are two aspects to the defendant’s case on the plaintiff’s engagement in work that is unrelated to the defendant’s work scope (“non-company business”):

> (a)     first, the plaintiff had mainly engaged in non-company business during office hours, as seen from his calendar entries which show that an estimated 60% of his office hours was spent on such business; and

> (b)     second, the plaintiff had instructed the defendant’s employees to engage in non-company business during working hours.[^143]

110    In my view, the defendant is not entitled to rely on the second aspect of its case. The defendant failed to properly plead this aspect of its case as it did not provide any particulars of: (a) the occasions on which the plaintiff had instructed the defendant’s employees to engage in non-company business, (b) who those employees were, and (c) the nature of the non-company business they were asked to engage in. Moreover, the plaintiff did not have reasonable opportunity to respond to the affidavit evidence of the defendant’s witnesses on these matters because such evidence was not put to him in cross examination. In the circumstances, the plaintiff would be irreparably prejudiced if I were to permit the defendant to advance the argument that the plaintiff had used its employees for non-company business during working hours.

111    My analysis therefore focuses on the first aspect of the defendant’s case, which has been properly pleaded.[^144] For the reasons explained below, I find that the plaintiff had engaged in non-company business during office hours without the defendant’s consent.

(A)   Whether the plaintiff’s calendar entries show that he had engaged in non-company business

112    The defendant relied on a slew of calendar entries to demonstrate the plaintiff’s involvement in non-company business during office hours. For convenience, I have summarised these calendar entries in a table in Annex 1.

113    Based on the event descriptions in these calendar entries, it is not apparent that these events pertained to the conduct of the defendant’s business. Regrettably, the plaintiff did not lead any evidence on the nature of these events and how they concerned the defendant’s business. He simply submitted that all Logisym events were considered work related because: (a) he did not apply for leave to attend such events, (b) Dr Elms had consented to his involvement in other business interests, such as running Logisym, apart from his employment with the defendant, and (c) the defendant had participated in Logisym work as seen from the Logisym brochure in 1ABD 435 and certain email correspondence in 1ABD 217.[^145]

114    However, this submission cannot stand for the following reasons:

> (a)     The very nature of the plaintiff’s argument that Dr Elms had acquiesced to his involvement in other business interests (including running Logisym on the side) implies that Logisym events are distinct from the defendant’s business;

> (b)     The plaintiff has not pointed me to any objective evidence that the defendant had participated in Logisym work which is the subject matter of the calendar entries. While the Logisym brochure in 1ABD 435 shows that Dr Elms was a speaker at a Logisym event held on 17 to 18 May 2017, that is simply one isolated event and more importantly, it is not one of the calendar entries the defendant is complaining of. The email correspondence in 1ABD 217 does not show the defendant’s employees participating in Logisym work. Although Ms Rankine and Ms Tee were copied on the email correspondence, they were not instructed in the emails to do any work for Logisym. Instead, one TJ Ooi was instructing Logisym’s Myla Morales to make certain updates to a marketing brochure for a SME Digital Economy Summit.

> (c)     Furthermore, even if I take the plaintiff’s case at its highest that he did not take leave to attend Logisym events, a failure to take leave to attend an event does not necessarily imply that the event in question is work related.

115    In the premises, I find that the calendar entries in Annex 1, which include Logisym events, did not pertain to the conduct of the defendant’s business.

116    Based on the timing of the events described in the calendar entries, I find that all the entries, except for the following, pertained to non-company business conducted during office hours (hereinafter termed the “Relevant Entries”):

> (a)     s/no. 13, 17, 46, 55, 66, 83, 93, 96 and 117 of Annex 1, which were conducted outside office hours;

> (b)     s/no. 29 of Annex 1, which shows that the plaintiff was on leave that day; and

> (c)     s/no. 33, 57, 65, 89, 104, 111, 116, 119, 129 of Annex 1, which were conducted during lunch hour.

117    It is difficult to estimate how much of the plaintiff’s office hours were spent on non-company business, in particular, whether it was at least 60% (as alleged by the defendant). The key reason for this difficulty is that many of the Relevant Entries do not state the duration of the events, but simply their starting time. Nonetheless, it is fair to say, based on the Relevant Entries, that the plaintiff had regularly engaged in non-company business during office hours, at least a few times each month, from the time he joined the defendant in June 2017 until his suspension in mid-September 2019.

(B)   Whether the defendant had consented to the plaintiff engaging in non-company business

118    The plaintiff submits that the defendant’s consent to his engagement in non-company business is evident from the following:[^146]

> (a)     Dr Elms’ admission in \[14\] of her AEIC that she had agreed that the plaintiff would continue to run Logisym on the side during the course of his employment with the defendant;

> (b)     Dr Elms’ alleged testimony in cross examination that she had agreed to the plaintiff’s work involving Logisym as stated in her AEIC;

> (c)     the email correspondence in 1ABD 217 which shows that the defendant’s employees were involved in work for Logisym;[^147]

> (d)     the absence of any contemporaneous WhatsApp messages or emails in which Dr Elms questioned the plaintiff on his alleged involvement with other work activities that exceeded what she had expected and complained about his alleged overutilisation of his annual leave; and

> (e)     Dr Elms and Ms Rankine’s failure to complain about the plaintiff’s alleged overutilisation of his annual leave during the 16 September Meeting and the 20 September Meeting.

119    In my judgment, when Dr Elms hired the plaintiff, their agreement was that the plaintiff could not simply use office hours to conduct his non-company business: he had to take paid annual leave or, where his paid annual leave was insufficient, unpaid leave, to attend to such business. This is most evident from the plaintiff’s own email to Chitra (a former administrative executive of the defendant) on 7 August 2018, which was copied to Dr Elms.[^148] In the email, the plaintiff informed Chitra that with his upcoming trip to Oman, he would have spent more than 21 days away from the office in Oman, and that any time over and above the 21 days (which was his annual leave entitlement) should be considered no pay leave and should be calculated as such for the purposes of payroll. The authenticity and truth of contents of the email is undisputed, as is the fact that the plaintiff’s work in Oman was not work done for the defendant.

120    The question then is whether the plaintiff had taken leave (whether paid or unpaid) on the dates set out in the Relevant Entries. If he had not, was the defendant aware at the material time that the plaintiff was engaging in non-company business without taking leave, and had nonetheless consented to such conduct? In this regard, it is the state of knowledge of Dr Elms, and not Ms Rankine, that is crucial. Ms Rankine’s role in the defendant was only that of an administrative executive[^149] until 27 August 2019, when she became a director. Thus, prior to 27 August 2019, Ms Rankine did not have any authority, on behalf of the defendant, to consent to the plaintiff engaging in non-company business without taking leave.

121    I first address whether the plaintiff had taken leave on the dates set out in the Relevant Entries.

122    In his closing submissions, the plaintiff did not dispute the non-Logisym entries in the defendant’s summary of his annual leave in 1ABD 343.[^150] The non-Logisym entries in that summary match the dates of s/no. 9, 28, 32, 54 (for 29 – 30 August 2018 only), 68 and 82 of Annex 1. Thus, the parties are in agreement that the plaintiff had taken leave on those dates.

123    For the rest of the dates set out in the Relevant Entries, I find that the plaintiff did not take leave. The plaintiff did not give any evidence on what were his leave dates during the course of his employment with the defendant. Moreover, he took the position in his closing submissions that he did not take leave for Logisym events because he considered them to be work-related.[^151] Thus, by his own admission, he would not have taken leave for the Logisym events mentioned in the Relevant Entries.

124    I move on to the issue of knowledge and consent. For the following reasons, I am not satisfied that Dr Elms knew at the material time that the plaintiff was engaging in non-company business without taking leave.

> (a)     While Dr Elms was aware that the plaintiff’s involvement in Logisym and in the Oman project had expanded beyond what she had purportedly agreed to,[^152] I find that she did not know that the plaintiff had not taken leave to attend to those engagements. There is no objective evidence that Dr Elms was keeping track of whether the plaintiff was taking the necessary paid or unpaid leave to attend to his non-company business. This is unsurprising since it was the plaintiff, and not Dr Elms, who was in charge of HR in the defendant (see \[96\] – \[99\] above).

> (b)     In relation to those Relevant Entries which did not contain any express reference to Logisym or Oman, the plaintiff did not refer me to any objective evidence that Dr Elms was aware of him engaging in such non-company business.

125    The matters set out in \[118\] above do not assist the plaintiff in showing that the defendant had consented to him engaging in non-company business without taking leave.

> (a)     The parties’ agreement at the outset that the plaintiff could continue to run Logisym on the side during the course of his employment with the defendant, is simply that. It does not go further to show that Dr Elms knew, at the material time, that the plaintiff was engaging in non-company business, without taking leave, on the occasions set out in the Relevant Entries.

> (b)     Dr Elms was not copied on the email correspondence on 21 June 2019, and hence would not have been aware of the correspondence. In any event, the correspondence does not show the defendant’s employees being involved in work for Logisym (see \[114(b)\] above).

> (c)     Given that Dr Elms was unaware at the material time that the plaintiff was engaging in non-company business without taking leave, naturally she would not have sent any contemporaneous WhatsApp messages or emails to the plaintiff to question such conduct on his part.

> (d)     There is no evidence to suggest that at the time of the 16 September Meeting and the 20 September Meeting, Dr Elms and/or Ms Rankine were aware that the plaintiff had not taken leave on the occasions set out in the Relevant Entries. Thus, it is unsurprising that they did not raise any complaints on this subject at the meetings.

> (e)     In any event, the defendant had a specific focus in those meetings. The transcript of the 16 September Meeting shows that the defendant’s key agenda was to find out more about what the plaintiff had done to prompt Amazon to pull its support from ABTA and to decline to renew its membership in ABTA, and to inform the plaintiff that he was placed on administrative leave while the defendant considered its next steps.[^153] The transcript of the 20 September Meeting shows that the defendant’s key agenda was to ask the plaintiff to resign with immediate effect.[^154] It was not the defendant’s intention to raise every complaint it may have against the plaintiff, in those meetings.

126    Engaging in other business during working hours without the approval of one’s employer is an established instance of breach of the implied duty of good faith and fidelity: _Asiawerks Global Investment Group Pte Ltd v Ismail bin Syed Ahmad_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR(R) 234</span> at \[61\], cited with approval in _Man Financial (S) Pte Ltd v Wong Bark Chuan David_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 663</span> at \[193\].[^155] Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff had breached his implied duty of good faith and fidelity by regularly engaging in non-company business during office hours without the defendant’s approval.

##### (5)   Whether the plaintiff had asked Ms Aitkuzhina to co-publish an article during working hours, and failed to give her credit for the article

127    Ms Rankine asserted in her AEIC that the plaintiff had asked Ms Aitkuzhina to publish an article for Logisym Magazine with him during working hours, and Ms Aitkuzhina had written the entire article herself. However, the plaintiff published the article solely under his name in the August addition of Logisym Magazine.[^156] The defendant submits that such affidavit evidence shows that the plaintiff had asked its intern to carry out non-company business during office hours, and did not give the intern any credit.[^157]

128    In my judgment, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate Ms Rankine’s assertions in her AEIC. The defendant has not adduced any objective evidence that the plaintiff had assigned Ms Aitkuzhina to write the article during office hours (such as email correspondence between them regarding the article), and that the plaintiff had eventually published the article under his sole name. The defendant also did not call Ms Aitkuzhina to be a witness to corroborate Ms Rankine’s account of events.

### (b)   Whether the plaintiff’s misconduct amounted to a repudiation of his employment with the defendant

#### The law on repudiation of employment contracts

129    The four situations set out in _RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 413</span> (“_RDC Concrete_”) on when a breach of contract would amount to a repudiatory breach, are of general application to all contracts, including employment contracts: _Phosagro Asia Pte Ltd v Piattchanine, Iouri_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 1052</span> (“_Phosagro_”) at \[54\].[^158] The parties’ submissions focused on situations 3(a) and (b) of _RDC Concrete_, namely:[^159]

> (a)     whether the plaintiff’s misconduct had breached a condition of his employment contract (ie, situation 3(a)); and

> (b)     whether the plaintiff’s misconduct had deprived the defendant of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended the defendant should obtain from the contract (ie, situation 3(b)).

130    On the issue of whether a particular term is a condition, it is trite that the Court must ascertain the parties’ intention by construing the contract in light of the surrounding circumstances as a whole, to determine whether they had intended to designate that term as one so important that any breach, regardless of its actual consequences, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract: _Phosagro_ at \[57\].

131    Moving on to situation 3(b) of _RDC Concrete_, misconduct which destroys the relationship of trust between the employee and employer and renders the employment relationship untenable would fall within situation 3(b). _Sinclair v Neighbour_ <span class="citation">\[1967\] 2 QB 279</span> is a case involving such misconduct_._ In that case, an employee of a bookmaker took out monies from the till without permission to place a bet in a betting shop, and repaid the money into the till the next day when his bet turned out to be successful. The English Court of Appeal held that summary dismissal of the employee was justified as the employer would not have granted permission to borrow money from the till for gambling, and the employee’s dishonesty was inconsistent in a grave way with his employment and had breached the relationship of confidence between him and his employer so as to render him unfit to continue in the job: _Phosagro_ at \[53\].

#### The parties’ submissions

132    The defendant submits that the Implied Duties were conditions of the plaintiff’s employment contract, and that the plaintiff had, by his misconduct, breached the Implied Duties. Further or alternatively, the plaintiff’s misconduct had deprived the defendant of substantially the whole benefit of the employment contract, as it had destroyed the relationship of trust between the parties and rendered the employment relationship untenable.[^160]

133    The plaintiff contends that he did not repudiate his employment with the defendant as he was not guilty of the alleged misconduct in the first place. In relation to the comments to Quint, the plaintiff also contends that he had made those comments in his personal capacity and that those comments were unrelated to his responsibilities as an employee of the defendant, not least because Amazon was a member of ABTA (a separate legal entity from the defendant). Hence, those comments cannot be considered gross misconduct that amounted to a repudiation of the plaintiff’s employment contract.[^161]

#### My findings

134    I have found above that the plaintiff had breached his Implied Duties by:

> (a)     making racially insensitive comments to Quint to the effect that Emiratis were lazy;

> (b)     making a racially insensitive joke on ‘yellow fever’ to Mr Sanchez;

> (c)     failing to fulfil his responsibility to ensure that Mr Sanchez had a written employment contract;

> (d)     arranging for Mr Au to be added to the defendant’s CPF payroll without the defendant’s approval, thereby causing the defendant to disburse CPF contributions to Mr Au; and

> (e)     regularly engaging in non-company business during office hours, without the defendant’s approval.

135    In my judgment, these breaches fell within situation 3(b) of _RDC Concrete_, in that their cumulative effect was to destroy the relationship of trust between the parties and render untenable the continuation of the plaintiff’s employment with the defendant. The relationship of trust between the parties was destroyed particularly because:

> (a)     The plaintiff’s racially insensitive comments to Quint and Mr Sanchez gave the defendant cause for concern that he might make racially insensitive comments to clients of the defendant and/or ABTA, thus causing these clients to withdraw their business from the defendant and/or ABTA.[^162]

> (b)     The plaintiff’s racially insensitive comments to Quint and Mr Sanchez also gave the defendant cause for concern that he might make racially insensitive comments to other employees of the defendant, as a result of which they may feel uncomfortable working with him. That may in turn adversely affect the plaintiff’s ability to manage and work with the employees.

> (c)     Furthermore, the plaintiff demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty in arranging for Mr Au to be added to the defendant’s CPF payroll, and in regularly engaging in non-company business during office hours, without the defendant’s approval.

136    Given my findings above, it is not necessary for me to consider whether situation 3(a) of _RDC Concrete_ has also been made out on the facts.

137    In the premises, I find that the defendant was justified in terminating the plaintiff without notice. The plaintiff’s claim for wrongful termination is accordingly dismissed.

## Issue 4: Whether the plaintiff is owed salary for 11.5 days of unconsumed annual leave, or had been overpaid for salary and expenses totalling S$33,520.40

#### Whether the plaintiff had 11.5 days of unconsumed leave, or had instead utilised three excess days of leave

138    The plaintiff’s case is that he had 11.5 days of unconsumed annual leave for 2019. This is calculated on the basis that he had 17.5 days of leave for 2019 (being his 21 days annual leave entitlement prorated to 10 months) but had only taken 6 days of leave.[^163] He should therefore be paid salary in the sum of S$4,670.72 in lieu of such leave.[^164]

139    The defendant’s case is that the plaintiff had taken three excess days of leave, as seen from its summary of the plaintiff’s annual leave in 1ABD 343 (which I have reproduced in Annex 2). Thus, the defendant had overpaid the plaintiff’s salary in the sum of S$1,159.08, which it is entitled to be refunded.[^165]

140    I find that the plaintiff has not proven his claim for 11.5 days of unconsumed annual leave. He did not provide any documentary evidence to support his assertion that he had only taken six days of paid leave in 2019.

141    On the other hand, I find that the defendant has proven its counterclaim that the plaintiff had taken three excess days of leave. In his closing submissions, the plaintiff disputes the defendant’s summary of his annual leave in only one aspect. That is, for the entries pertaining to Logisym events in the defendant’s summary, the plaintiff was not on leave, and did not have to take leave, because these events were work-related and he had attended them with the defendant’s permission. The plaintiff submits that once these events are removed from the defendant’s summary, the total leave he took in the course of his employment with the defendant was 32.5 days, leaving 17 days of unconsumed leave which is more than his claim for 11.5 days of unconsumed leave.[^166] However, I am not persuaded that the defendant had consented to the plaintiff attending Logisym events without taking leave, for the reasons articulated in \[124(a)\] above. Thus, I accept the defendant’s summary of the plaintiff’s annual leave as reproduced in Annex 2.

142    The plaintiff did not take issue with the defendant’s calculation that three excess days of leave equates to S$1,159.08 in salary. I therefore grant the defendant’s counterclaim for salary overpayment of S$1,159.08 in light of the plaintiff’s utilisation of three excess days of leave.

#### Whether the defendant had overpaid the plaintiff’s salary in 2018 in the sum of S$25,419.61

143    The defendant contends that it had overpaid the plaintiff’s salary by S$25,419.61. The breakdown is as follows:[^167]

> (a)     April 2018 – the plaintiff’s CPF contributions of S$1,200 were not deducted from his salary even though the defendant had paid the plaintiff’s portion of his CPF contributions;

> (b)     October 2018 – the plaintiff was involved in the Oman project for 20 days but declared only 2.2 days unpaid leave. He was therefore overpaid S$6,877.21 (inclusive of employer’s CPF contributions);

> (c)     November 2018 – the plaintiff was involved in the Oman project for 20 days but declared only 6.9 days unpaid leave. He was therefore overpaid S$5,061.21 (inclusive of employer’s CPF contributions);

> (d)     December 2018 – the plaintiff was involved in the Oman project for 20 days but declared only 8.3 days unpaid leave. He was therefore overpaid S$4,520.41 (inclusive of employer’s CPF contributions);

> (e)     January 2019 – the plaintiff was involved in the Oman project for 20 days but did not declare any unpaid leave. He was therefore overpaid S$7,760.87 (inclusive of employer’s CPF contributions).

144    In my judgment, the defendant has failed to prove that the plaintiff’s CPF contribution of S$1,200 was not deducted from his salary for April 2018. The defendant’s payslip on the plaintiff’s salary for April 2018 suggests that such a deduction was made.[^168] The defendant has not disclosed any documents, such as bank statements, to show that it had paid the plaintiff’s full salary of S$8,500 for April 2018 without deducting his CPF contribution.[^169]

145    Turning to the Oman project, I accept the defendant’s case that the plaintiff had worked on that project – which is undisputedly non-company business – for 20 calendar days a month from October 2018 to January 2019. In an email exchange between Ms Rankine and Logistics Executive’s Mr Darryl Judd (“Mr Judd”) on 16 November 2019,[^170] she had asked Mr Judd if he had worked with the plaintiff on the Oman project and if so, what were the number of days the plaintiff had worked on the project from 2018 to 2019. Mr Judd replied that “_He \[the plaintiff\] was engaged for a period of 20 calendar days per month from the start of the project to the end._ … He worked along side me on this project. _It has been continuing without him (I replaced him in Feb …_” (my emphasis). The authenticity and truth of contents of this email are not disputed.

146    The plaintiff submits that while he was overseas in Oman for several days between October 2018 and January 2019, he was not overseas in Oman for a continuous 20 days a month during that period. His calendar entries only show him in Oman from 1 to 3 October 2018 and 14 to 17 January 2019. With respect, this submission is misconceived for two reasons.

> (a)     First, the defendant’s counterclaim is premised on the plaintiff working on the Oman project, as opposed to being in Oman, for 20 days a month from October 2018 to January 2019. It is not the plaintiff’s case that he could only work on the Oman project while he was physically in Oman.

> (b)     Second, the plaintiff’s calendar entries are not an exhaustive record of all the occasions he was in Oman. To give an example, in his email to Chitra on 7 August 2018,[^171] the plaintiff stated that with his upcoming trip to Oman, he would have spent _more than 21 days away from the office in Oman that year_. However, his calendar entries for 2018 only record him being in Oman for _three days_ that year, namely from 1 to 3 October 2018.

147    The plaintiff also relies on several WhatsApp messages between him and Dr Elms as evidence that he was still carrying out work for the defendant from October 2018 to January 2019.[^172] However, those WhatsApp messages do not assist the plaintiff. All those WhatsApp messages show is that the plaintiff was carrying out some work for the defendant on a few selected dates in October 2018 and November 2018. They do not show that the plaintiff had not worked 20 calendar days for the Oman project in those months.

148    Additionally, the plaintiff submits that this counterclaim is an afterthought due to the absence of any contemporaneous documents in which Dr Elms had questioned him on his time spent on the Oman project, and the defendant’s failure to mention the project in the 16 September Meeting, the 20 September Meeting and the 16 October Letter.[^173] I am unable to accept this submission. The defendant had only discovered the full extent of the plaintiff’s involvement in the Oman project on 16 November 2019, when Ms Rankine received Mr Judd’s email reply (see \[145\] above). Moreover, for the reasons explained in \[124(a)\] above, I do not think Dr Elms had kept track of whether the plaintiff took the necessary paid or unpaid leave (as the case may be) to attend to his work for the Oman project.

149    Lastly, the plaintiff contends that the defendant is not entitled to raise the allegation that it had overpaid his salary on account of the Oman project, because this allegation was not put to him.[^174] In my view, this contention is wholly unmeritorious. The rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 97 is not a rigid or technical rule: it does not require a litigant to put every aspect of his case to the witness. In particular, a litigant need not put his case if the witness had clear notice that the issue is disputed, for example, through the litigant’s pleadings: _Tee Yok Kiat and another v Pang Min Seng and another_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 85</span> at \[65\]. In the present case, it is clear from the defendant’s pleadings that the allegation of overpayment of the plaintiff’s salary on account of the Oman project formed part of its counterclaim.[^175] I consider this to be sufficient notice to the plaintiff.

150    On the appropriate quantum of damages for this counterclaim, the plaintiff did not take issue with the defendant’s calculations as set out in \[143(b)-(e)\] above. I therefore award the defendant damages in the sum of S$24,219.70, being the salary it had overpaid the plaintiff from October 2018 to January 2019.

#### Whether the defendant had overpaid the plaintiff’s expenses in the sum of S$5,683.86

151    Dr Elms gave evidence that the defendant had overpaid the plaintiff’s expenses in the total sum of S$5,683.86. She provided the following breakdown of the alleged overpayments:[^176]

![]([2022] SGDC 0049_Image/[2022] SGDC 0049_image1.png)

![]([2022] SGDC 0049_Image/[2022] SGDC 0049_image2.png)

152    The plaintiff argues that the defendant cannot rely on the allegation that it had overpaid his expenses, because this allegation was not put to him.[^177] I reject this argument. The defendant is not required to put the allegation to the plaintiff since he had clear notice from the defendant’s pleadings that the allegation formed part of the counterclaim.[^178]

153    I find that the defendant has proven overpayment of the plaintiff’s expenses to the extent of S$3,864.97 only. My views on each alleged overpayment are set out in the table below.

154    Since it is the defendant’s case that it had underpaid certain expenses of the plaintiff totalling S$4.10,[^195] these underpayments should be taken into account. Thus, I find that the defendant is entitled to a net refund of S$3,860.87 (being S$3,864.97 less S$4.10) for overpayment of the plaintiff’s expenses.

#### Whether the defendant is entitled to recover the S$300 expenses it had allegedly incurred to dispose the plaintiff’s items in the office

155    Dr Elms gave evidence that the defendant had incurred S$300 to dispose the plaintiff’s items that were left in its office after he was suspended and terminated.[^196]

156    I find that the defendant has not proven this counterclaim. Even assuming that the items shown in the photographs in 1ABD 415 – 419 belonged to the plaintiff and he had failed to clear them from the office, the defendant has not adduced any invoices or receipts showing that it had incurred costs of S$300 to dispose these items.

#### Whether the defendant is entitled to recover S$957.85, being the alleged unpaid costs of the plaintiff’s Logisym travel in July 2019

157    It is undisputed that the defendant paid S$957.85 for the plaintiff’s Logisym travel in July 2019, and that the plaintiff has not refunded this amount to the defendant.[^197] The plaintiff’s defence is that the defendant had paid this amount because it was for a work-related event.

158    I reject the plaintiff’s defence as he did not adduce any evidence to show that the Logisym event in July 2019 was a work-related event. I also reject the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant is not entitled to recover the S$957.85 because it did not cross examine him on this sum.[^198] It is not necessary for the defendant to put this aspect of its counterclaim to the plaintiff, as he had clear notice of the same from the defendant’s pleadings.[^199]

159    Thus, I find that the defendant is entitled to recover the costs of the plaintiff’s Logisym travel in July 2019 in the sum of S$957.87.

#### Conclusion

160    In summary, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claim for salary in lieu of unconsumed annual leave, and find that the defendant had overpaid the plaintiff’s salary and expenses in the total sum of S$30,197.52.

## Issue 5: Whether the plaintiff had been overpaid for the 2 May Loan and the 29 March Loan

### Whether the defendant had agreed to pay an additional S$500 to the plaintiff in relation to the 2 May Loan

161    Dr Elms gave evidence that she did not request the plaintiff to make the 2 May Loan as the defendant had sufficient monies in its bank account at that time to pay for salaries, rent and other expenses. Thus, there was no agreement between the parties that the defendant would pay an additional S$500 to the plaintiff for the loan. The plaintiff had, in breach of his Implied Duties, repaid himself an additional S$500 as repayment of the loan.[^200]

162    The plaintiff’s case is that he had extended the loan at Dr Elms’ request, and that the additional sum of S$500 was paid to him, at Dr Elms’ suggestion, as reasonable compensation for loss of bank interest on the monies loaned. In this regard, the plaintiff testified that he initially did not want to extend the loan because he would have a hard time explaining to his wife why he was loaning monies from their joint bank account to the company he was working for, and they would lose the opportunity to earn interest on the sum loaned. Dr Elms then asked him how much was the interest, to which he replied 1% to 2% a year. The plaintiff and Dr Elms agreed that it would be too complicated to calculate the exact loss of interest. Thus, they came up with the figure of S$500, ie, S$100 a month over five months.[^201]

163    I accept Dr Elms’ evidence that she had not requested the plaintiff to make the 2 May Loan. The defendant had no need for the loan because its OCBC bank statement for May 2018 show that it had sufficient monies in its bank account to pay for salaries, rent and other expenses that month, even without the loan.[^202] Flowing from this, I find that Dr Elms had not agreed that the defendant would pay an additional S$500 to the plaintiff for the 2 May Loan. I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s evidence on how the parties had come to an agreement that the defendant would pay him an additional S$500 for the 2 May Loan. Among other things, there is no documentary evidence to support his assertions that the monies for the 2 May Loan came from his joint bank account with his wife, and that the interest that could be earned on monies in that account was 1% to 2%.

164    I have earlier found that the plaintiff was in charge of managing the defendant’s finances, had control of the defendant’s bank account, and did not have to seek Dr Elms’ approval for any dealings with regard to the defendant’s bank account (see \[88\] – \[89\] above). In light of these findings, I am satisfied that the plaintiff had authorised the payment of the additional S$500 to himself without Dr Elms’ knowledge, whether it was by using the bank token himself to execute the fund transfers or (if he had indeed passed the bank token to another employee at the time) by instructing that employee to do so. This amounted to a breach of the plaintiff’s implied duty of good faith and fidelity. I therefore grant the defendant’s counterclaim for a refund of the additional S$500 paid for the 2 May Loan.

### Was the quantum of the 29 March Loan S$10,000 or S$20,000

165    The defendant submits that the 29 March Loan was only S$10,000, made by way of cash deposit into its bank account.[^203]

166    The plaintiff avers that the 29 March Loan was S$20,000. The source of the loan was an OCBC cash cheque no. 277439. The loan was withdrawn in cash and the sum of S$20,000 was handed over to Ms Rankine.[^204]

167    I find that the quantum of the 29 March Loan was S$20,000. The email exchanges between the plaintiff and Ms Rankine from 26 to 28 March 2019 show that the defendant required S$20,000 to cover “the cost of the workshop and Geneva”. They also show that on 28 March 2019, Ms Rankine had asked the plaintiff to have the monies ready by Friday (ie, 29 March 2019), to which the plaintiff replied that he would pass her the cash the next morning.[^205] The authenticity of the email exchanges is not disputed.

168    Consistent with the email exchange, the plaintiff’s OCBC bank statement for March 2019 shows that a S$20,000 cash withdrawal was made from the account by way of a cash cheque no. 277439.[^206] The defendant has not provided a satisfactory explanation for why the plaintiff would only loan it S$10,000 when the email exchange clearly shows an agreement that the plaintiff would loan it S$20,000. Accordingly, I dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim for overpayment of the 29 March Loan.

## Issue 6: Whether the allegedly excessive payments of S$42,405.17 made by the defendant to the plaintiff for the Cars were approved by the defendant

169    The basis of the defendant’s counterclaim in relation to the Cars may be summarised as follows.[^207]

> (a)     On 23 August 2018, the plaintiff emailed Dr Elms, suggesting that since her Prius was due to be scrapped, she could use the scrap value of the Prius to purchase an inexpensive car for the defendant, and that she could purchase a second car for her family’s use. Dr Elms replied that she was only in the market for one car. Subsequently, on 30 January 2019, the plaintiff represented to Dr Elms that the cost for each car (ie, a 2008 Subaru Impreza) would be around S$9,900 and that he would assist in purchasing the cars. On the basis of the prices represented to her, Dr Elms agreed to purchase two cars, one for her family’s personal use and another for the defendant.

> (b)     However, in the course of its investigations after the 16 September Meeting, the defendant discovered that the payments it and Dr Elms had made to the plaintiff for the Cars totalled S$62,205.17. The details of these payments are set out in the table below.

> (c)     These payments vastly exceeded the plaintiff’s initial stated price of S$9,900 per car. Moreover, the plaintiff had, without the defendant’s approval, used its monies to pay for the car meant for the personal use of Dr Elms’ family.

> (d)     In relation to the car meant for the defendant, the defendant does not know the actual cost of the car. The plaintiff had authorised payments totalling S$25,153.17 from the defendant’s bank account to his Maybank account between March 2019 to July 2019 without Dr Elms’ knowledge and approval (see s/no. 9, 11 to 13 and 15 of the table above).

> (e)     In relation to the car SJL 478Z meant for the personal use of Dr Elms’ family, the plaintiff had instructed Dr Elms to pay him the sum of S$9,452 which she received from scrapping her Prius (see s/no. 14 and 16 of the table above). But unknown to Dr Elms, the plaintiff had also arranged for the defendant to pay him the following sums for the car without her approval:

>> (i)       the plaintiff issued cheques from the defendant to himself for the sums set out in s/no. 1 to 4 of the table above, which total S$11,100 (collectively, the “First Series of Car Cheques”). These sums were paid allegedly on account of “Shocks & Radiator”, “Tires”, “Debs Car Repair” and “SL4782”; and

>> (ii)       the plaintiff instructed the issuance of five cheques from the defendant to himself, each for S$3,300, allegedly to pay for the COE of the car (collectively, the “Second Series of Car Cheques”). These payments are set out in s/no. 5 to 8 and 10 of the table above.

> (f)     Accordingly, the defendant counterclaims the sum of S$42,405.17 for _excessive_ payments for the Cars (being the total expenses of S$62,205.17 incurred for the Cars, less the plaintiff’s initial stated price of S$9,900 per car), which the plaintiff had authorised from its bank account in breach of his Implied Duties.

170    For the reasons set out below, I find that the defendant has partially proven this counterclaim in the sum of S$3,152.

#### What were the representations made on the cost of each car

171    The defendant relies mainly on the plaintiff’s email to Dr Elms and her husband on 30 January 2019 at 8.07am, as evidence that the plaintiff had represented the cost of each Car to be around S$9,900.[^208] In my view, the defendant’s reliance on that email is misconceived.

172    In that email, the plaintiff informed Dr Elms and her husband that they would “get $9,000+ from scrapping the Prius”, which would be used towards getting them a new Subaru, and that they would spend the following sums (which total S$9,900) towards the new Subaru:[^209]

> Car - $5700 – paid by RK

> “Make Good” – Approx - $800 - $1000 (including service and tyres)

> Insurance - $800 – paid by RK

> Road Tax - $400

> Amount towards COE loan - $2000

173    However, that is not all the plaintiff said. The plaintiff also stated that he would get Ms Rankine to organise “a 10 year _COE loan for only $24,000_ for 7 years so that the monthly instalment will only be about $330 or so” (my emphasis).

174    Neither Dr Elms nor her husband objected to the contents of the plaintiff’s email. Instead, Dr Elms simply asked the plaintiff where the money from the scrapping of the Prius would go to and how it would get to her. Dr Elms’ husband replied to thank the plaintiff for his assistance.[^210]

175    Thus, it is clear from these email exchanges on 30 January 2019 that:

> (a)     the discussion therein pertained to only one of the Cars, namely SJL 478Z which was intended for the personal use of Dr Elms’ family. Dr Elms in fact acknowledged this during cross examination.[^211]

> (b)     the plaintiff had made it clear, and Dr Elms and her husband had approved, that the car would cost the amounts quoted in \[172\] above _plus_ the S$24,000 COE loan. In other words, the plaintiff had represented that the car would cost S$33,900, and not S$9,900 as alleged by the defendant.

176    As for the other Car (ie, the company car), the defendant did not refer me to any objective evidence on what the plaintiff had represented, and the defendant had approved, to be the cost of that Car. For this reason, the defendant’s counterclaim in relation to that Car fails.

#### The quantum of excessive payments made for SJL 478Z

177    Since the defendant’s counterclaim is for _excessive_ payments (ie, the actual cost _less_ the approved cost of each Car), I now turn to the quantum of excessive payments made for SJL 478Z.

178    I have found above that the approved cost of SJL 478Z was S$33,900. It is undisputed that the total amount spent on SJL 478Z was S$37,052, comprising of:[^212]

> (a)     S$27,600 paid by the defendant to the plaintiff via the First Series of Car Cheques and the Second Series of Car Cheques; and

> (b)     the remaining S$9,452 paid by Dr Elms to the plaintiff.

179    The quantum of the excessive payments made for SJL 478Z is therefore S$3,142.

#### Did the defendant authorise the use of its monies to pay for SJL 478Z

180    The plaintiff admits in his pleadings that he had issued the First Series of Cheques from the defendant to himself, as reimbursement for the payments he made for expenses incurred in respect of SJL 478Z.[^213] Furthermore, Ms Rankine gave evidence in her AEIC that it was the plaintiff who had instructed her to prepare the Second Series of Cheques and had then signed those cheques and cashed them,[^214] and this aspect of her evidence was not challenged in cross examination.[^215]

181    The key issue is therefore whether and to what extent Dr Elms had approved the plaintiff’s use of these monies from the defendant’s bank account to pay for SJL 478Z. In this regard, I do not accept the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant is prevented from asserting its pleaded case that the expenses for the Cars were not approved by Dr Elms, by reason of its failure to put its case to him.[^216] That submission stems from a misunderstanding of the rule of _Browne v Dunn_, which does not require a litigant to put his case to the witness if the witness has clear notice of his case through the pleadings (see \[149\] above).

182    On this key issue of approval, Dr Elms gave evidence that since SJL 478Z was meant for her personal use, she had not intended to use, or authorised the use of, the defendant’s monies to pay for the car. At the material time, the plaintiff had full access to the defendant’s bank accounts, and he had signed all cheques on behalf of the defendant. He had thus authorised the use of the defendant’s monies to pay for the car without her approval.[^217]

183    On the other hand, the plaintiff gave evidence that Dr Elms was kept fully apprised of all expenses relating to the Cars, and that all payments for the Cars were made with her knowledge and authority.[^218] In this regard, the plaintiff submits that Dr Elms was aware from his emails to her on 23 August 2018 at 1.11pm and 30 September 2018 that there was an intention for the defendant to pay for the Cars, and she had explicitly consented to the same in her WhatsApp message to the plaintiff on 10 September 2018 at 6:27:31pm.[^219] Since Dr Elms had approved the purchase cost of the Cars to be borne by the defendant, all consequential expenses for the Cars, including post purchase expenses, would flow the same way.[^220]

184    I accept Dr Elms’ evidence, and reject the plaintiff’s evidence, on this issue for the following reasons:

> (a)     The scrap value of the Prius was applied towards the cost of SJL 478Z meant for the personal use of Dr Elms’ family, as opposed to the other Car which was the company car.[^221] This supports Dr Elms’ assertion that she had intended to use her own monies, and not the defendant’s monies, to pay for SJL 478Z. Moreover, the plaintiff had conceded at trial that when he made the arrangements for the registration of SJL 478Z, it was Dr Elms who was supposed to pay the monthly instalments for the car.[^222]

> (b)     The plaintiff’s emails to Dr Elms on 23 August 2018 at 1.11pm and 30 September 2018, and her WhatsApp message to him on 10 September 2018, do not show that she had consented to using the defendant’s monies to pay for SJL 478Z. The portion of the 23 August email cited by the plaintiff simply states: “we (ATC) are also in a decent place financially so that when the time comes to scrap the Prius, you can also get a new car for Matt (or you)”.[^223] It does not state that the new car would be purchased using the defendant’s monies. While the 30 September email did suggest that the “second car” could be registered in the defendant’s name and purchased using the defendant’s monies,[^224] there is no evidence that Dr Elms had agreed to that suggestion. Her WhatsApp message to the plaintiff on 10 September 2018 at 6:27:31pm cannot constitute such an agreement because it pre-dates the 30 September email and moreover, no evidence was led from the plaintiff or Dr Elms as to what she meant by “Ok to car” in that message.

> (c)     I have earlier held that the plaintiff was in charge of managing the defendant’s finances, had control of the defendant’s bank account, and did not have to seek Dr Elms’ approval for any dealings with regard to the defendant’s bank account (see \[88\] – \[89\] above). In the premises, I am satisfied that Dr Elms was not aware at the material time that the plaintiff had used a total of S$27,600 from the defendant’s bank account to pay for SJL 478Z.

185    In the premises, I find that the plaintiff had breached his Implied Duties in using the defendant’s funds to pay for SJL 478Z without Dr Elms’ approval.

#### Conclusion

186    In light of the above, I find that the defendant is entitled to damages in the sum of S$3,172, being the quantum of the excessive payments made for SJL 478Z using its funds.

187    For completeness, I address the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant’s counterclaim in relation to the Cars should be dismissed because there is no basis for the defendant to seek restitution in equity when the Cars were registered in Dr Elms’ name and she had conceded at trial that she ought to have paid for the expenses for the Cars.[^225] In my view, this submission is misconceived for two reasons. First, the counterclaim is premised on breaches of the plaintiff’s Implied Duties, and not restitution in equity.[^226] The defendant had confirmed during the final tranche of the trial that it is no longer pursuing any counterclaim against the plaintiff for breach of fiduciary duties.[^227] Second, the plaintiff is not entitled to rely on this submission as it is not his pleaded case, or his evidence, that Dr Elms was required to pay for the Cars. On the contrary, his pleaded case and his evidence is that Dr Elms was aware of and had authorised all the payments for the Cars that were made using the defendant’s monies.[^228]

## Issue 7: Whether the defendant is entitled to damages for the losses it allegedly suffered in its move to the New Premises

#### The defendant’s case

188    The defendant has two limbs to its counterclaim for losses it allegedly suffered in its move to the New Premises:[^229]

> (a)     First, the plaintiff had negligently misrepresented that the vacant floors of the New Premises could be sublet, thereby inducing the defendant to lease the New Premises.

> (b)     Second, the plaintiff had breached his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence by causing the defendant to enter into a lease which did not permit subletting except with the landlord’s consent, and by failing to obtain the landlord’s consent to sublet the vacant floors of the New Premises.

189    The defendant relied heavily on the following evidence of Dr Elms to support both limbs of its counterclaim.

> (a)     After Dr Elms found the New Premises online on 15 June 2019, she had tasked the plaintiff to survey and check out the premises that day. The plaintiff organised a visit that weekend for them to check out the New Premises. While the asking rent of the New Premises was S$18,000, the plaintiff thought that he could get it for less, and verbally represented to Dr Elms that two floors of the New Premises could be sublet and the rent from subletting could be used to offset the cost of the move to the New Premises.[^230] The plaintiff also represented to Dr Elms that he had a contractor team who could manage all the renovation for the New Premises for S$10,000. I will refer to these representations collectively as the “Representations”.

> (b)     Based on the Representations, Dr Elms decided that the defendant should lease the New Premises and left it to the plaintiff to negotiate and sign the lease. The plaintiff negotiated the terms of the Tenancy Agreement, and signed the agreement while Dr Elms was overseas.[^231]

> (c)     However, the Representations turned out to be false. Under the Tenancy Agreement, the vacant floors could not be sublet without the landlord’s consent. Dr Elms and Ms Rankine were unaware of this restriction until after they had delivered the Tenancy Agreement to a few property agents whom the defendant had engaged to market the vacant floors for subletting. It was only then that they learnt from Andrew Ng (“Mr Ng”), the property agent acting for the landlord of the New Premises, that the landlord would not consent to sublet the vacant floors. This meant that the monthly rent of the New Premises was well in excess of what the defendant could afford in light of its finances at the time.[^232]

> (d)     As the plaintiff was tasked to search for potential new office space for the defendant, he owed a duty of care to the defendant to provide it with accurate information to make a decision regarding the move. The plaintiff had breached his duty of care, as well as his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence, in making the Representations without first ensuring that subletting would be permitted by the landlord.[^233]

> (e)     Quite apart from the inability to sublet the vacant floors, the defendant encountered the following issues in relation to the New Premises:

>> (i)       considerably more than S$10,000 was spent by the defendant on renovating the New Premises;

>> (ii)       the contractors engaged by the plaintiff to renovate the New Premises were unlicensed and their work was shoddy and substandard;

>> (iii)       contrary to the plaintiff’s statement to Dr Elms that the landlord of the Previous Premises would be fine releasing the defendant early from its lease, the landlord charged the defendant break lease fees of S$19,500 and did not return its security deposit for the premises.[^234]

> (f)     Dr Elms would not have allowed the defendant to lease the New Premises, had she known all the aforementioned issues and problems that the defendant would face.[^235]

190    The defendant claims that as a result of the plaintiff’s aforementioned negligent misrepresentations and breaches of his implied duties, it had suffered losses totalling S$109,876.90 in its move to the New Premises. I have set out these losses in a table in Annex 3.

#### Whether the plaintiff had negligently misrepresented to the defendant that the vacant floors could be sublet

191    In my judgment, the first limb of the counterclaim, which is premised on negligent misrepresentation, is fundamentally flawed. It is trite that in a claim for misrepresentation, the representor must either be the counterparty to the contract or an agent of that counterparty: Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore, Contract (Volume 7) (LexisNexis Singapore, 2014 Reissue) at \[80.172\] and \[80.187\]. In the present case, the counterparty to the Tenancy Agreement was Academy of Medicine, Singapore, who was the landlord of the New Premises. It is not the defendant’s case, nor is there any evidence, that the plaintiff was the landlord’s agent.[^236] Consequently, the counterclaim for negligent misrepresentation cannot stand.

#### Whether the plaintiff had breached his Implied Duties by causing the defendant to enter a lease which did not permit subletting except with the landlord’s consent and by failing to obtain the landlord’s consent to sublet

192    The second limb of the counterclaim is also not made out. While I am satisfied that the plaintiff had breached his Implied Duties by failing to obtain the landlord’s consent to sublet before he signed the Tenancy Agreement, I find that his breaches did not cause the defendant to suffer its alleged losses. I elaborate on this below.

##### (1)   The plaintiff had breached his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence

193    It is undisputed that on 15 June 2019 (ie, the day Dr Elms found the New Premises online), Dr Elms had asked the plaintiff to drive by to look at the premises, and the plaintiff did so. Thereafter they made arrangements with the property agent, Mr Ng, to view the New Premises, and did the viewing together on 16 June 2019.[^237] On 17 June 2019, the plaintiff made an offer on behalf of the defendant to the landlord of the New Premises to lease the premises at a monthly rent of S$15,000.[^238]

194    I find that the plaintiff had verbally proposed to Dr Elms on or about 15 or 16 June 2019 that the defendant could sublet the vacant floors of the New Premises. There is no evidence that at the time Dr Elms suggested the New Premises to the plaintiff as a potential option to explore, she had contemplated subletting the vacant floors. By contrast, in the plaintiff’s WhatsApp messages to Ms Rankine on 17 June 2019, he had informed her that the defendant would occupy three floors and sublet two floors of the New Premises.[^239] The plaintiff did not state in these messages, his pleadings, his AEIC or at trial that subletting was Dr Elms’ idea as opposed to his idea. In fact, his AEIC was silent on whether or not he had informed Dr Elms that the defendant could sublet the vacant floors of the New Premises. Nor was it put to Dr Elms during cross examination that subletting was her idea. In the circumstances, I accept Dr Elms’ evidence that the plaintiff had told her that the defendant could sublet the vacant floors.

195    Given that the monthly rent of the New Premises was significantly higher than that of the Previous Premises, I find that Dr Elms would have taken into account the plaintiff’s proposal to sublet the vacant floors in deciding to lease the New Premises, and that the plaintiff was aware of this.

196    The documentary evidence supports Dr Elms’ evidence that she had put the plaintiff in charge of negotiating the lease of the New Premises. The plaintiff was the person who made the offer on behalf of the defendant to the landlord to lease the New Premises on 17 June 2019.[^240] Mr Ng had liaised over email and text messages with the plaintiff on the terms of the lease and sent him the floor plans, the draft Letter of Intent and the Tenancy Agreement for his review.[^241] The plaintiff had also signed the Letter of Intent and the Tenancy Agreement.[^242] Contrary to the plaintiff’s assertion at trial,[^243] I do not think that Dr Elms was involved in negotiations with the property agent for the lease of the New Premises. There is no objective evidence of Dr Elms’ involvement in the negotiations, such as emails or text messages between her and Mr Ng.

197    In light of the plaintiff’s responsibility to negotiate the lease for the New Premises, and his knowledge that subletting was a relevant factor in Dr Elms’ decision to lease the premises, I find that his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence required him to check whether the landlord would permit the defendant to sublet the vacant floors, and to ensure that such consent was obtained, before he signed the Tenancy Agreement. I do not accept the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant is barred from asserting that he had a duty to obtain the landlord’s consent for subletting, by reason of its failure to put that duty to him.[^244] It is unnecessary for the defendant to put that duty to the plaintiff, since that duty had clearly been pleaded.[^245]

198    I find that the plaintiff had breached his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence. It is not the plaintiff’s case, nor is there any evidence, that he had made any efforts to check whether the landlord would permit the defendant to sublet the vacant floors, and to secure the landlord’s consent for subletting, before he signed the Tenancy Agreement. As it turned out, the landlord did not consent to subletting. I accept Dr Elms’ evidence that the property agent, who was empowered to act on behalf of the landlord, had verbally informed her that subletting of the vacant floors would not be possible.[^246]

199    The plaintiff submits that he did not breach his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence because Dr Elms and Ms Rankine had notice of the terms of the Tenancy Agreement prior to its execution, but nonetheless decided to proceed to lease the New Premises.[^247]

200    In my view, this submission has no merit. It was Dr Elms, not Ms Rankine, who had the authority to authorise the defendant to lease the New Premises in June and July 2019.[^248] Ms Rankine was only an administrative executive at that time. Hence, it is Dr Elms’ state of knowledge that is relevant. In this regard, the plaintiff relies on Dr Elms’ query on stamp duty in her email to him on 15 July 2019 at 5.19pm,[^249] as evidence that she had notice of the terms of the Tenancy Agreement prior to its execution. Such reliance is misconceived. The Tenancy Agreement had already been executed by the plaintiff and the landlord on 12 July 2019, a few days prior to Dr Elms’ email.[^250] Moreover, Dr Elms’ email was issued in response to the plaintiff forwarding her an email which Mr Ng had sent him about two hours earlier. In Mr Ng’s email, he had attached the executed Letter of Intent, Tenancy Agreement and Inventory List for the plaintiff’s reference, and had informed the plaintiff that “_as stamp duty needs to be done by tenant, can I check if you’ll be doing it or you like me to assist? I think it’s about $2.2k._” (my emphasis).[^251] I find that it was in view of Mr Ng’s statement in his email on stamp duty that Dr Elms had queried whether stamp duty was payable, as she was under the impression that Americans were exempt from stamp duty under the US-Singapore FTA.[^252] Dr Elms did not have sight of the Tenancy Agreement prior to its execution.

201    Furthermore, I do not agree with the plaintiff’s submission that Dr Elms’ evidence of the landlord’s refusal to consent to subletting is inadmissible hearsay.[^253] While the defendant did not call the property agent, Mr Ng, or the landlord to give evidence of the landlord’s refusal, it cannot seriously be disputed that Mr Ng had authority to act on behalf of the landlord on all matters pertaining to the defendant’s lease of the New Premises. After all, the plaintiff had liaised with Mr Ng at all times when negotiating the lease of the New Premises. Thus, I find that when Mr Ng verbally informed Dr Elms that subletting would not be possible, it was the landlord, speaking through its agent, who was informing Dr Elms of this fact. Dr Elms therefore had personal knowledge that the landlord would not consent to subletting. Her evidence on this matter is not hearsay.

202    I also reject the plaintiff’s submission that the Court should draw an adverse inference from the defendant’s failure to call the landlord as a witness.[^254] Before the Court is entitled to draw the desired inference, there must be some evidence, even if weak, which is adduced by the party seeking to draw the inference, on the issue in question. In other words, there must be a case to answer on that issue which is then strengthened by the drawing of the inference: _Sudha Natrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 1 SLR 141</span> at \[20\]. The plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to show that the landlord would have consented to subletting. He has simply denied the defendant’s case that the landlord had refused to give its consent. Thus, there is no basis for me to infer that the landlord’s evidence, if adduced, would have been unfavourable to the defendant.

##### (2)   The plaintiff’s breaches of his implied duties did not cause the defendant to suffer the alleged losses

203    Although the plaintiff had breached his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence, the defendant’s counterclaim ultimately fails because the defendant has not proven, on the balance of probabilities, that these breaches caused it to suffer the alleged losses.

204    It is established law that the claimant may recover damages for a loss only where the breach of contract was the “effective” or “dominant” cause of that loss: _Sunny Metal Engineering Pte Ltd v Ng Khim Ming Eric_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 782</span> at \[60\].[^255] Hence, to prove causation in the present case, the defendant must show that it would not have entered into the Tenancy Agreement had it known, at the time, that the landlord would not consent to subletting. I am not satisfied that the defendant would have taken such a course of action:

> (a)     If the inability to sublet the vacant floors was a deal breaker for the defendant, one would expect Dr Elms to have told the plaintiff so when she left it to him to negotiate the lease for the New Premises. However, it is not Dr Elms’ evidence that she had told this to the plaintiff.[^256]

> (b)     Dr Elms’ evidence in her AEIC is that she would not have allowed the defendant to lease the New Premises had she known of all the issues and problems that they would face. These issues and problems were not limited to the inability to sublet the vacant floors. They included other issues and problems which are summarised in \[189(e)\] above.[^257] In a similar vein, Dr Elms testified at trial that she would not have authorised the move to the New Premises if she had known of its true financial implications, including the fact that the renovation costs were significantly higher than anticipated and that the landlord of the Previous Premises would not return the defendant its security deposit.[^258] In the premises, it was clearly a combination of factors that would have changed Dr Elms’ mind about leasing the New Premises: the inability to sublet the vacant floors was not the dominant factor.

> (c)     Moreover, there is insufficient evidence to support Dr Elms’ assertion that the defendant’s finances required it to sublet the vacant floors in order to afford the rent of the New Premises.[^259] The defendant did not disclose any financial statements, in particular profit and loss statements, to show that it could not afford the rent of the New Premises without the ability to sublet the vacant floors. Instead, it relied heavily on the fact that it had to take a S$80,000 loan from the plaintiff in order to finance its move to the New Premises. However, Dr Elms had testified that the need for the loan arose largely because the defendant did not receive its security deposit for the Previous Premises, had to pay unexpected break lease charges for early termination of its lease of the Previous Premises, and had yet to receive certain anticipated revenue from Seattle.[^260] It thus appears that the loan was required simply because the defendant’s cashflow was tight at that time due to events which it had not anticipated.

> (d)     Finally, if the plaintiff’s conduct had caused the defendant to enter into a lease which it could not afford, one would expect the defendant to complain about this to the plaintiff soon after it discovered that subletting of the vacant floors would not be possible. However, there is no evidence of any contemporaneous emails or WhatsApp messages in which Dr Elms raised such a complaint to the plaintiff. The defendant also did not, in the 16 October Letter or the Notice of Termination, raise this issue as an instance of the plaintiff’s misconduct which justified his summary dismissal. This is despite Dr Elms’ evidence that she was aware by mid-September 2019 that subletting would not be possible and that the expenses incurred in moving to the New Premises were more than anticipated.[^261]

205    Accordingly, I dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim for the alleged losses suffered in its move to the New Premises.

## Issue 10: Whether the defendant is entitled to damages for the alleged loss of Amazon as a client of the defendant and a member of ABTA

206    There are three sub-issues to be resolved for the defendant’s counterclaim for the alleged loss of Amazon as its client and a member of ABTA:

> (a)     whether Amazon had terminated its working relationship with the defendant as a result of the plaintiff’s comments to Quint;

> (b)     whether Amazon’s decision to withdraw its support from ABTA and not to renew its membership in ABTA was caused by the plaintiff’s comments to Quint; and

> (c)     finally, whether the defendant had suffered loss of income of at least US$97,500 as a result of Amazon’s decision to withdraw its support from the defendant and/or ABTA.

207    It suffices for me to address only the final sub-issue, as I am of the view that the defendant has not proven any losses arising from Amazon’s decision to withdraw its support from the defendant and/or ABTA. This alone disposes of its counterclaim.

208    The defendant’s case is that it had, in the pipeline for 2020, a series of workshops in various countries which were to be organised with Amazon’s support (the “Proposed 2020 Workshops”). While the specific budgets had not been clarified, the request for funding for 2020 was meant to be US$150,000. This was following Amazon’s support in 2019: Amazon had provided ABTA and the defendant funding in the total sum of US$97,500, which included US$25,000 in ABTA membership fees that year. Thus, Amazon’s withdrawal of support from the defendant and ABTA, following the plaintiff’s comments to Quint, had caused the defendant to suffer losses of at least US$97,500. Such losses are in the form of:[^262]

> (a)     loss of income from contracts which Amazon would have awarded the defendant; and

> (b)     loss of income from contracts which Amazon would have awarded ABTA, which directly resulted in losses suffered by the defendant in terms of secretariat fees. In this regard, it is evident from ABTA’s profit and loss statements that 80% to 90% of its revenue went towards secretariat fees paid to the defendant.

209    In other words, the defendant relies on Amazon’s funding of US$97,500 in the first year of its engagement as proof of the minimum amount Amazon would have funded the defendant and/or ABTA in 2020.

210    In my judgment, that is insufficient to establish that the defendant had suffered losses of at least US$97,500 as a result of Amazon’s withdrawal of support. This is for three reasons.

211    First, since the defendant would have to incur expenses in order to generate income from Amazon’s patronage in 2020, its expectation loss is the net profits, as opposed to the gross income, that it would have earned from Amazon. The defendant’s counterclaim for loss of income is fundamentally flawed as it does not give credit for the expenses that the defendant would have to incur to generate such income. In fact, the defendant did not give any evidence on what and how much those expenses would be.

212    Secondly, the amount of past income one has received is not necessarily indicative of the amount of future income one is likely to receive. The defendant has to show that the Proposed 2020 Workshops required at least as much funding as the projects Amazon had funded in 2019, and that Amazon was willing to provide such funding for the workshops. Regrettably, the defendant did not adduce any objective evidence to show this, such as email correspondence or minutes of meetings or calls it had with Amazon regarding the Proposed 2020 Workshops. Nor did the defendant call Amazon’s representatives to give evidence on these matters.

213    What the defendant adduced were email correspondence that purportedly show Amazon’s increasing involvement with ABTA and the defendant prior to its alleged withdrawal of support in September 2019.[^263] However, those correspondence at best demonstrate that Amazon had supported and/or was involved in certain initiatives of ABTA (and not the defendant) between March and early September 2019. There is no indication in those correspondence whether those initiatives would continue into 2020 and if so, how much funding Amazon would provide for those initiatives.

214    Thirdly, while I accept that Amazon would have renewed its membership in ABTA in 2020 but for the plaintiff’s racially insensitive comments to Quint,[^264] it is unclear whether such membership fees would have translated into secretariat fees paid by ABTA to the defendant. Based on ABTA’s profit and loss statement for the years 2018 and 2019, secretariat fees were not its only expenses: it had incurred other expenses such as consultant fees, transfer fees and computer and internet expenses.[^265] The defendant did not disclose ABTA’s profit and loss statement for the year 2020 to show its revenue and expenses that year, in particular, whether its revenue was sufficient to cover its other expenses apart from secretariat fees. Thus, there is no basis for me to find that any portion of the membership fees Amazon would have paid in 2020 would have translated into secretariat fees to the defendant.

215    For the forgoing reasons, I dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim for damages of at least US$97,500 for the loss of Amazon as a client of the defendant and a member of ABTA.

## Conclusion

216    In conclusion, my key findings on each issue are as follows:

> (a)      Issue 1: The plaintiff is entitled to recover only S$70,000, being the outstanding principal of the 1 July Loan and the 12 July Loan. The defendant did not agree to bear any additional bank charges which the plaintiff incurred as a result of extending these loans.

> (b)      Issue 2: The plaintiff was wrongfully suspended without pay for the period 1 October 2019 to 7 November 2019, and is entitled to damages in the sum of S$9,847.62.

> (c)      Issue 3: The defendant was justified in terminating the plaintiff without notice on account of his breaches of his Implied Duties. Accordingly, the plaintiff is not entitled to any salary in lieu of notice.

> (d)      Issue 4: The defendant had overpaid the plaintiff’s salary and expenses in the total sum of S$30,197.52, and is entitled to recover this amount from the plaintiff. The overpayment comprises of:

>> (i)       salary overpayment of S$1,159.08 in light of the plaintiff’s utilisation of three excess days of leave;

>> (ii)       salary overpayment of S$24,219.70 for the months October 2018 to January 2019 in light of the plaintiff’s involvement in the Oman project;

>> (iii)       overpayment of the plaintiff’s expenses in the sum of S$3,860.87; and

>> (iv)       the unpaid cost of the plaintiff’s Logisym travel in July 2019 in the sum of S$957.87.

> (e)      Issue 5: The defendant had overpaid the plaintiff S$500 for the 2 May Loan and is entitled to recover this amount from the plaintiff. However, the defendant did not overpay the plaintiff for the 29 March Loan, which was in the sum of S$20,000.

> (f)      Issue 6: The defendant is entitled to recover S$3,152, being the excessive payments for the car SJL 478Z which the plaintiff had authorised from its bank account without Dr Elms’ approval.

> (g)      Issue 7: The defendant is not entitled to any damages for the losses it had allegedly suffered in its move to the New Premises. It has not proven that such losses were caused by the plaintiff’s breaches of his implied duties of good faith and reasonable diligence.

> (h)      Issue 8: The defendant is not entitled to any damages for the alleged loss of Amazon as its client and a member of ABTA, as it has not proven its losses.

217    After setting off the amounts which the parties are found to owe each other, a net amount of S$45,998.10 is due from the defendant to the plaintiff. Accordingly, judgment is entered for the plaintiff for the sum of S$45,998.10 and interest on this sum at 5.33% p.a. from the date of the Writ to the date of judgment. I will hear parties on costs if their incidence and amount cannot be agreed upon within 21 days of this judgment.
