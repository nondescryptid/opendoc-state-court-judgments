### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Background

_The Charges_

1       The accused, Ms Lee Lay Yoke, a 55 year-old female Singapore citizen had claimed trial to _one charge_ of criminal breach of trust as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **DAC 935479 -2017** and _28 charges_ of forgery under s 465 of the Penal Code in **DAC 935451 - 2017** to **DAC 935478 - 2017**.

2       It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused who was then a Senior Finance Manager with the Singapore Human Resources Institute (“**SHRI**”) had misappropriated cash amounting to $43,329.20 (“the cash”) from her company by forging 28 DBS bank transaction receipts in order to conceal the fact that she had misappropriated the cash.

3       On 14 November 2019, at the conclusion of the trial and after a careful consideration of the totality of the evidence as well as the written submissions before me, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the 29 proceeded charges in **DAC 935451 - 2017** to **DAC 935479 - 2017**. I did not accept her defence that was essentially a bare denial of all the 29 charges preferred against her. Accordingly, I convicted the accused on all of the 29 proceeded charges. This matter was adjourned for sentencing to 28 November 2019 to enable the accused who was unrepresented to prepare her written plea in mitigation.

4       On 28 November 2019, after a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charges before me, I imposed the following sentences:

I ordered the sentences for **DAC 935451 - 2017**, **DAC 935456 - 2017** and **DAC 935479 - 2017** to run consecutively. The global sentence imposed on the accused was seventeen months’ and six weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 28 November 2019.

5       Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against her conviction and sentences in respect of **DAC 935451 - 2017** to **DAC 935479 - 2017** on 28 November 2019. She is presently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal.

6       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

#### The Trial

## B.   Undisputed Facts

9       The undisputed facts in the present case are set out below:

> a)     The accused was employed as a Senior Finance Manager of Singapore Human Resources Institute (“SHRI”) from November 2014 to 23 May 2017;

> b)     SHRI provides education in human resources management, consultation services for human resources and membership services for human resource professionals;

> c)     Between 4 February 2017 and 19 May 2017, the accused was Head of the Finance Department. PW3 and one Lee Siew Lian who was also known as ‘Jennifer’ were both part-timers at SHRI who reported to the accused;

> d)     Whenever students of SHRI Academy Pte Ltd made any cash payment for their course fees, application fees, examination fees or late charges, they would hand over the cash to either the receptionist or the respective programme managers. The programme managers would hand over the cash, the Settlement of Invoice (“the receipt”) generated from the student management system and a tax invoice to a SHRI employee from the Finance Department, namely to PW3 and if she was not around, to either the accused or Jennifer;

> e)     The SHRI employee from the Finance Department who received the cash would write the student’s name, date, and amount of cash on a DBS deposit slip. The cash and the DBS deposit slip would then be kept in a locked drawer in SHRI;

> f)     The cash collected from the students of SHRI Academy Pte Ltd would be deposited into SHRI’s DBS bank current account No: XXX by an employee of SHRI. The proof of this cash deposit would then be handed to PW3 who would update the transactions into the MYOB records. MYOB was the accounting software that SHRI used to record all the accounting transactions;

> g)     In order to have access to the daily DBS bank statements, the SHRI employee from the Finance Department would require a DBS IDEAL token, a user ID as well as a password in order to log into the DBS website. The bank statements would then be uploaded onto the accounts shared drive by the SHRI employee;

> h)     At the material time the accused was issued with a DBS IDEAL token with the user ID XXX;

> i)     PW3 was tasked by the accused to match the proof of deposits (i.e. the DBS transaction receipts or bank deposit slips) against the Excel sheet daily bank statements to ensure proper accounting of the monies. PW3 would do so by copying the Excel sheet daily bank statements from the accounts shared drive and saving it onto her working folder. PW3 was not tasked to match the proof of deposits against the actual DBS bank statements;

> j)     Between 4 February 2017 and 19 May 2017, an employee of SHRI was to deposit various sums of cash amounting to $43,329.20 collected from students of SHRI Academy Pte Ltd by either the receptionist or the respective programme managers into SHRI’s bank current account;

> k)     The said SHRI employee did not deposit the cash into SHRI’s bank current account and instead had forged 28 DBS transaction receipts and provided them to the SHRI Finance Department as proof of the deposits;

> l)     The said SHRI employee had submitted to PW3 the said 28 forged DBS transaction receipts as proof of the deposits as well as the unused cash deposit slips (_Exhibit P4_);

> m)     The DBS representative’s (PW5) gave evidence that the alleged 28 transactions relating to the deposit of cash belonging to SHRI did not take place. The content of the DBS transaction receipts were untrue and that they were falsely created and

> n)     The SHRI employee who misappropriated the cash belonging to SHRI Academy Pte Ltd and forged the DBS transaction receipts appeared to be the same employee who inserted additional lines into the Excel sheet bank statements of SHRI (_Exhibit P3_) in order to reflect false transactions of the cash deposits into SHRI Academy Pte Ltd’s bank account.

## C.   Issues

10     The main issues before me was whether the accused was the SHRI employee who had forged the DBS transaction receipts and who had misappropriated cash amounting to $43,329.20.

11     In the present case, it was the Prosecution’s case theory that the accused was the SHRI employee who committed all of the 29 charges. To prove its case the Prosecution had adduced both documentary and oral evidence through its six witnesses as well as the accused’s own confessions in a statement recorded under s 22 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) (“CPC”) and 29 statements recorded under s 23 of the CPC. In contrast, the accused had denied committing any of the offences and had retracted the confessions in her unchallenged police statements in the course of the trial.

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

## The Law

#### The law on criminal breach of trust by servant

12     It was submitted by the Prosecution that in order to establish an offence of criminal breach of trust as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code against the accused, the following must be proved: _Balasundaram s/o Suppiah v PP[^1]_:

> (a)     The accused was an employee of SHRI;

> (b)     The accused was in her capacity as a SHRI’s employee entrusted with property; and

> (c)     The accused had dishonestly misappropriated the said property entrusted to her.

#### The law on forgery

13     It was also submitted by the Prosecution that in order to establish an offence of forgery under s 465 of the Penal Code, it must be proven that the accused had dishonestly or fraudulently made the 28 false DBS transaction receipts with the intention of causing it to be believed that the receipts were genuine when she knew that they were not. It was further submitted that the meaning of “fraudulently” refers to doing a thing with an “intent to defraud” (section 25 of the Penal Code).

14     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Court of Appeal in _PP v Li Weiming and others_ \[2014\][^2] at \[84\] has defined “intent to defraud” as “practicing a deception with the aim of causing an injury, loss or detriment or obtaining an advantage”.

## The accused was the one who committed the offences

15     It was submitted by the Prosecution that it is trite that the Court can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on her demeanour, the internal consistency in the context of her evidence and the external consistency between the content of her evidence and extrinsic evidence (_Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP[^3]_ at \[39\]). It was further submitted that the Court should find that PW3 was a credible witness and that, on the other hand, the accused was not a credible witness.

## The Accused passed the documents in Exhibits P4 to PW3

16     According to the Prosecution, PW3 had testified that at the end of each day if there were cash in the drawer, she would inform the accused about it. The accused would then instruct her on who would deposit that sum of cash. If the accused was not there, PW3 would lock the cash in the drawer until the next day. On the following day, she would then pass it to the ‘office boy’ known as “Poh Hin” or to the accused herself to deposit the cash.

17     It was submitted that PW3 had testified that between February 2017 to May 2017, the only people who were responsible for depositing cash were herself, Poh Hin and the accused. However, in respect of the proof that accompanied each deposit, PW3 had testified that the accused would pass her a different form of proof of deposit. Whenever PW3 or Poh Hin deposited cash, the proof of deposit was the cash deposit slip prepared by the staff with the additional bank’s machine print to show the cash deposited and the bank-in date over-the-counter at the DBS bank. An example of such cash deposit slips was as shown in _Exhibit P6_.

18     In contrast, according to PW3 whenever the accused deposited the cash she would hand to PW3 a DBS transaction receipt and a cash deposit slip without a bank machine print showing the amount deposited and the bank-in date. PW3 testified that the accused told her that she had deposited the cash at a DBS cash deposit machine instead of at the bank. The accused would also hand the DBS transaction receipts in _photocopied_ form to PW3 instead of the original form. PW3 further testified that all 28 pages in _Exhibit P4_, showing the 28 photocopied DBS transaction receipts at the top and the unused cash deposit slips at the bottom (except for pages 7 to 9 where there was no cash deposit slip) were handed to her by the accused.

19     It was highlighted by the Prosecution that during her cross-examination by the accused when challenged regarding Poh Hin’s proof of deposit, PW3 had candidly agreed that Poh Hin had previously used a cash deposit machine when there was a long queue at the bank. However, PW3 explained that _Poh Hin would pass her the DBS transaction receipt in its original form_, and that he did not pass her any such transaction receipts in the year 2017.

20     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had not produced any evidence to show that Poh Hin had indeed deposited cash using the cash deposit machine in the period of February 2017 to May 2017. It was submitted by the Prosecution that the accused had claimed that Poh Hin had previously deposited cash in _December 2015_ by attempting to adduce a document showing a cash deposit of $620 in December 2015 into SHRI’s bank account. However, this document was not admitted as part of the Defence’s case exhibit as the accused was unable to prove the authenticity of the document. It was further submitted that in any case, the document was not crucial as it did not cover the period of the offences between 4 February 2017 and 19 May 2017.

21     It was submitted by the Prosecution that the accused’s defence appeared to be that while she did receive some cash from the programme managers (specifically the sums reflected in pages 19 to 23 of _Exhibit P5_), she had later passed the the cash to PW3. According to the accused, she did not receive any sum of cash to deposit in SHRI’s bank account. It was further submitted that she had admitted that she could have deposited cash in either 2014 or 2015 but she was unable to specify when she last deposited cash. She simply insisted that it was a long time ago and that she did not do so during the alleged period in February to May 2017.

22     It was the Prosecution’s case that this not only contradicted by PW3’s testimony, but also internally inconsistent with two of the accused’s statements recorded under s 22 CPC namely _Exhibit P9_ and _Exhibit P39_ where she stated that she was involved in depositing cash during the alleged period.

23     It was also the Prosecution’s case that the accused ran a vague defence that she completely did not know what happened to the cash that was collected from the SHRI Academy Pte Ltd students as she was busy with other tasks in February 2017 to May 2017. She had also alleged that there were days that she worked from home. It was submitted by the Prosecution that during her cross-examination, she had conceded that she was in fact at the SHRI office _everyday_, although on some days she only arrived in the afternoon.

24     According to the Prosecution, in comparison to PW3’s evidence, the accused’s explanations were convoluted and illogical. The accused had agreed that based on her signature at page 22 of _Exhibit P4_, she had received the cash from the programme manager when the money was first received from the student. She then wrote on the cash deposit slip at the bottom of page 22 of _Exhibit P5_ before passing the cash and the cash deposit slip back to PW3. The accused had testified that:

> “A    I did not deposit the money. I have passed to her already on the 18th of April if you look at the rubber stamp.[^4]”

It was submitted by the Prosecution that the accused’s explanations were not externally consistent with the documentary evidence. It was the Prosecution’s case that the transaction at page 22 of _Exhibit P4_ and page 22 of _Exhibit P5_ clearly supported the fact that the accused had passed _Exhibit P4_ to PW3. It was highlighted that the words on the ‘RECEIVED’ stamp dated 18 April 2017 states “Bank in amt on 17 Apr 17”, and the false DBS transaction receipt showed a purported deposit of $1,800 on 17 April 2017. It was further submitted that based on the documentary evidence, the accused could not have passed the cash to PW3 on 18 April 2017 because the purported proof of deposit was on 17 April 2017.

25     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s explanations on the exact sum collected from the student had changed across her answers during her cross-examination. She had initially agreed to the following:

> Q    Alright. But, Diana, this is not an intercompany transfer. This is when the person who deposited cash banked in an additional 6.80 from that person pocket. Do you agree with this---

> A    Yes, I agree. Somebody---

> Q    explanation?

> A    Yes, I agree.[^5]

According to the Prosecution, this suggested that the student paid $1,793.20 but an additional $6.80 was deposited. However, the accused changed her explanations subsequently, saying that the student had paid $1,800 upfront and was supposed to get a refund of $6.80 the next time the student returned to SHRI.

> A    …The student should pay 1,793.2, okay? So, if---if then the academy manager has collected 1,800. The academy manager will have to get back 6.80 to refund to the student when the student comes back.[^6]

When confronted with the fact that the settlement of invoice shows that the student paid $1,793.20 on 17 April 2017, it was submitted that the accused shifted her explanation to say that the programme manager or the finance department gave the refund of $6.80 to the student first. When asked why the words written by PW3 states “to return back to Diana $6.80”, the accused had explained that the words actually meant that the monies were to be returned to her which she would then place it in the Finance Department’s container which kept the small change. She had also claimed that she could not remember when she wrote down the words “to deduct $6.80” in page 22 of _Exhibit P4_. It was the Prosecution’s case that after the accused was confronted with the evidence in page 22 of _Exhibit P4_ and page 22 of _Exhibit P5_, amidst a load of gibberish she said that she could not remember if she had passed the 28 DBS transaction receipts to PW3.

26     In light of the above, it was submitted by the Prosecution that PW3’s evidence ought to be believed over the accused. The material portions of PW3’s testimony that between February 2017 to May 2017 the accused had personally passed her DBS transaction receipts in the photocopied form and told her that she had deposited cash at the cash deposit machine, remained unchanged and logical throughout her examination-in-chief and cross-examination. It was the Prosecution’s case that this stood in stark contrast to the accused’s varied defences which are internally inconsistent, illogical and evolving across cross-examination.

## The accused downloaded and altered the Excel sheets in Exhibit P3

27     It was submitted that PW3 had testified that she received softcopies of the Excel sheets in _Exhibit P3_ from the accused because the latter had downloaded the Excel bank statements from the DBS website and had uploaded it onto the shared computer drive of the Finance Department. It was further submitted that the bottom left corner of each page in _Exhibit P3_ states “XXX” which was the bank token ID belonging to the accused during the material time. PW3 gave evidence that in 2017, the bank token with the said ID used to download the Excel sheets was kept by the accused in a locked drawer. Hence, the accused was the only one who uploaded the Excel sheets in _Exhibit P3_.

28     The Prosecution had highlighted that in response to the above, the accused ran two alternative defences against the Prosecution’s case. Her defences were:

> i)     she had downloaded the Excel sheets but anyone else could have altered them after she uploaded them onto the accounts shared drive;

> ii)     the edited Excel sheets were downloaded by someone else since anyone could have taken her bank token and there were also others in the company who had the bank token.

29     It was submitted that the accused has not provided any evidence to support her defences beyond merely asserting them. In respect of the first defence, PW3 had testified that the accounts shared drive was only accessible by the three SHRI accounts employees namely the accused, PW3 and Jennifer. In respect of the second defence, PW3 had testified that only the accused could access her own token as she kept her token locked in her drawer.

30     It was further submitted that the accused was unable to specify which defence she was relying on, or who else could have downloaded or edited the Excel sheets to implicate her. She had alleged that the auditors and “every IT guy” could have accessed the shared drive to edit the Excel sheets, and that the Directors and council members of SHRI also had the tokens to download the Excel sheets. However, she had not provided any plausible explanations as to why these people would have the motive to insert the extra lines into the Excel sheets or to use the accused’s bank token to download the Excel sheets. It was highlighted while the accused had suggested that Poh Hin could have handed the DBS transaction receipts to PW3, she had not suggested that Poh Hin had anything to do with the editing of the Excel sheets.

## The accused’s confession to all of the offences in her statements

31     It was the Prosecution’s case that in the accused’s long statement dated 11 August 2017 (_Exhibit P9_) and her 29 cautioned statements (_Exhibit P10_ to _Exhibit P38_), she had confessed to committing all the offences. In the long statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC, the accused had admitted to committing all the offences and had described how she committed them. Nevertheless, in the course of the trial she had retracted her confession in all 30 of her statements to the police.

32     It was submitted that in relation to the offence of criminal breach of trust, the accused had admitted that she had received the monies for the purpose of depositing them into SHRI’s bank account and had misappropriated them by spending them on her personal expenses. It was further submitted that in relation to the 28 forgery offences, the accused had explained in her statement that she had forged the DBS transaction receipts by reusing old DBS transaction receipts and changing the dates, times and amount. She had amended the contents of the photocopied reused transaction receipt by using her old Windows computer and selecting a font closest to the original font in the original DBS transaction receipt. She then made photocopies of the receipts and stapled the DBS deposit slip at the bottom of each photocopied page. According to the accused, she was aware that the contents would be used to update the records using the MYOB accounting software. It was the Prosecution’s case that the _mens rea_ for forgery was made out as the accused had practised a deception on PW3 by making her believe that the monies were indeed deposited, in order to cover up her misappropriation.

33     It was submitted by the Prosecution that the Court should give full weight to the accused’s confessions in her police statements. It was emphasised that the accused had not challenged the voluntariness or admissibility of these statements. Secondly, the accused had also not challenge the accuracy or the recording procedure of these statements. She had not cross-examined the recording officer (PW6) because she was feeling alright at that point in time when the statements were recorded.

## No satisfactory reasons for the retraction of her confessions in her police statements

34     In the present case, the accused had sought to retract all 30 of her unchallenged confession statements to the police. It was submitted by the Prosecution that the accused had claimed that when she provided the confession statement in _Exhibit P9_, she was feeling disappointed as she thought that one of her subordinates had committed offences under her care and she wanted to take responsibility for what had happened[^7].

35     It was highlighted by the Prosecution that the accused had testified that when she admitted guilt in Exhibit P9, she “…actually have got feelings for SHRI \[_sic_\]”[^8] and decided to take up the responsibility as a supervisor. She also claimed that she was very sad and she wanted to “…close the case and move on”[^9]. She was sad because nobody in SHRI contacted her to tell her what had happened and she became “fed up”[^10]. It was the Prosecution’s case that her explanations were plainly illogical as there was no reason why she would provide such a _full and detailed_ confession statement if she merely wanted to take up responsibility.

36     It was submitted that it was apparent from the statement that she had the consciousness to describe the details of the offences to the recording officer over the span of 1.5 hours. The IO had testified that the accused’s demeanour was normal and responsive during the recording of the cautioned statements, and that she did not appear unwell, confused, or nervous throughout the 1.5 hours of the recording of P9[^11].

37     The accused had also claimed ignorance of the consequences of providing the confession statement. She stated that “closing the case” meant that she wanted to plead guilty because she was under the impression she would receive a fine and move on. She said that had she known that the punishment would be more severe than a fine, she would not have admitted to the offences in her statement because at that time, she “already have lost most of the feelings for SHRI \[_sic_\]”[^12]. It was the Prosecution’s case that this contradicted the accused’s claim that she admitted guilt because she still “had feelings” for SHRI.

38     It was submitted that the accused’s explanation that she confessed under ignorance of the consequences was clearly a fabrication. She had conceded that when the cautioned statements (_Exhibit P10_ to _Exhibit P38_) were recorded more than one month after the recording of _Exhibit P9_, she knew that she was potentially facing a serious imprisonment term and _yet still confessed in all the cautioned statement_[^13]_._ Specifically, the IO had duly read and explained the warnings and potential punishment of the s 408[^14] and s 465[^15] Penal Code offences.

39     It was the Prosecution’s case that it is trite law that an accused person can be convicted solely on the basis of her own confessions, even if she subsequently retracts that confession at the trial. In _Syed Abdul Mutalip bin Syed Sidek v PP[^16]_, the Court of Appeal stated at \[21\]-\[22\]:

> “An accused person who retracts during his trial a confession he made earlier on can still be convicted on the basis of the confession if the court is satisfied that it was made voluntarily and that it was true.

> …

> While the court should consider any explanation that the accused person gives for his change of position, the explanation can be rejected if it is found to be untrue.”

It was submitted that the High Court in _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP_ had also commented at \[87\] that “if the explanation for the retraction is unsatisfactory then this may cast doubt on the entire evidence of that witness”.

40     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had sought to retract her confessions but had not provided any credible explanations for her drastic change of position at trial. It was submitted that her reasons were merely afterthoughts in order to downplay the significance of her confessions. Contrastingly, the IO has testified that accused’s demeanour was normal and responsive throughout the statement recordings, and there is no reason to disbelieve the IO’s credibility as a witness.

41     It was the Prosecution’s case that in light of the above the only reason that the accused gave such a detailed explanation in _Exhibit P9_ and the further confessions in _Exhibit P10_ to _Exhibit P38_ was that she was indeed the one who had misappropriated the cash and forged the 28 DBS transaction receipts. It was submitted that in the absence of any challenges against the statements and credible reasons for the change in position at trial, the Court was urged to give full weight to the statements in _Exhibit P9_ to _Exhibit P38_.

## The accused’s credit should be impeached under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act

42     In the course of the trial, the Prosecution had applied to have the accused’s credit to be impeached s 157(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, Rev. Ed. 1997) in light of the material discrepancies between her testimony and her police statements. It was the Prosecution’s case that during the accused’s cross-examination, it had established multiple material inconsistencies in key factual issues between the accused’s defence at trial and her first long statement dated 7 August 2017 (_Exhibit P39_).

43     It was submitted that there were two main inconsistencies in the accused’s version of events in her long statement (_Exhibit P39_) and her defence at trial:

> (a)     In her long statement at _Exhibit P39_, the accused admitted that she was involved in depositing cash as late as after Jennifer joined SHRI in October 2016. This was consistent with her caution statement in _Exhibit P9_ and clearly inconsistent with her defence at trial, asserting that she was not involved in depositing cash in February to May 2017.

> (b)     In _Exhibit P39_, the accused had stated that she tasked Ann to deposit the monies and photocopy the DBS transaction receipts and she would collect the receipt from Ann and pass it to PW3. The accused had conceded that she has given three inconsistent versions of who deposited the money and made the photocopied receipts:

>> i)       “Ann” did them in _Exhibit P39_,

>> ii)       the accused did them in _Exhibit P9_ to _Exhibit P38_ and

>> iii)       the accused did not know who did them (her defence at trial).

44     It was further submitted when confronted with the material inconsistencies in the long statement in _Exhibit P39_ the accused had admitted that she had intentionally lied in that statement[^17]. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused was unable to provide any satisfactory explanations for spinning those lies. It was submitted that the accused had claimed that she lied because she was feeling disappointed and sad when she found out that somebody in her department had committed fraud, and therefore wanted to assume guilt by taking the responsibility for the missing monies as it was misappropriated under her care as the finance manager. According to the Prosecution, this explanation was clearly illogical as the accused did not in fact take responsibility for the offences but had instead pushed the responsibility to “Ann”.

45     It was highlighted that the accused had also explained that she had lied because she was stunned and had said “whatever comes to mind” as a possible scenario of what could have happened so that she could subsequently find out what actually happened. It was the Prosecution’s case that this explanation did not make logical sense. It was highly unusual for the first thought of an innocent man was to concoct a convoluted lie rather than to simply state the truth. It was submitted that it was evident that the accused was stubborn and evasive in answering questions when confronted with her previous inconsistent statement. She had also blatantly admitted that she had lied in the statement. The Court was accordingly urged to find that the accused’s credit has been impeached under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act.

46     In conclusion, it was the Prosecution case that the evidence proved the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. It was submitted that PW3 had given cogent and consistent evidence against the accused that was corroborated by documentary evidence as well as the accused’s detailed confession statements. In contrast, the accused’s defence was unsubstantiated, inconsistent and incredible. The Prosecution urged the Court to find the accused guilty on all charges and to convict her accordingly.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

47     At the Close of the Prosecution’s Case, after the accused was invited to give evidence in her own defence, she had elected to give evidence in her defence. She testified that she was a consultant with a trading company on contract basis. She then provided some background of her experiences in life. She explained in her evidence-in-chief that initially she had decided to “_plead guilty as a servant_” as she had not realized the consequences.

48     The main thrust of the accused’s defence was that she had not forged the documents nor had she misappropriated the monies. She denied all the charges that were preferred against her by the Prosecution. She apologized for assuming _guilt as a servant_ too quickly as she was in a confused state of mind. The accused explained that she had wanted to conclude the case as soon as possible so that she could start afresh and find a new job.

49     According to the accused, in her 30-over years of professional training and work attitude, she had been taught that the superior should take responsibility for any wrongs/mistakes made by subordinates. It was submitted that when the charges were read to her at the Bedok Police Station and based on the evidence that was before her, she had admitted guilt in a mental state of flux and uncertainties knowing that someone in her team had committed wrongdoings. She further submitted that she had made and signed her statements in her state of anxiety, confusion, depression and ignorance of the consequences.

50     The accused had highlighted that from August 2017 to date, she had not tried to contact SHRI nor their staff with regards to the case as she was told by PW6 not to do so. According to her, she had made a police report when SHRI had elaborated on the details of the case at the 2019 AGM in the annual report. According to the accused, she sincerely believed that the truth would prevail and she would not be found guilty at trial.

51     She submitted that she had given up hope of natural justice when SHRI being a human resource institute had not contacted her for clarification nor investigation but had instead lodged a police report. She cited two previous instances where when SHRI had found wrongdoings, SHRI obtained restitution from a former staff and in another instance, an executive director was made to step down. She highlighted that PW1 who was then the Executive Director had decided to make a police report without offering her a chance for investigation and clarification.

52     The accused was of the view that the unfair treatment that she was subjected to was seen by some people as an injustice, considering her dedication to SHRI, her long work hours and her little pay. According to the accused, PW1 saw her indifference to under-performing staff and impartiality to staff and directors as arrogance.

53     She submitted that Ms Lee Siew Lian@Jennifer had an accounting background and her gesture in withdrawing as the Prosecution’s witness showed that things were happening in SHRI as she could not be of help to the accused. She also testified that she would not want to be part of a group that wants to “kill” her life as a professional who had worked with unreserved dedication and attitude.

## Witness testimony and evidence

#### DBS daily bank statements

54     It was highlighted by the accused that PW3 had testified that the accused had provided her with the Excel sheets in _Exhibit P3_ that was downloaded from the DBS website via an ID and a DBS token. It was submitted that the token was kept in the accused’s drawer and PW3 was aware of the location when she needed to access the DBS account. It was further submitted that after the accused left SHRI, PW3 did the same download for PW2.

55     It was submitted by the accused that although she had provided _Exhibit P3_, the documents were saved in the Accounts Shared Drive in the server and was never given to PW3 in hard copies as testified by PW3. It was the accused’s defence that she had only downloaded and saved the soft copy in the shared Finance server and had never provided the hard copies. It was submitted that anyone who had the intent would have been able to alter/edit the documents. According to the accused, anyone who was authorized could access the files in the server.

#### DBS transaction receipts

56     It was highlighted that PW3 had testified that the cash deposit machine slips with bank deposits slips without machine print were all provided by the accused and no one else would deposit cash in this manner via the cash deposit machine. It was submitted that if the accused had committed the forgeries, she would have distanced herself from her residence than highlight the fact. It was the case for the defence that the one who had forged the documents had accessed a past record file and altered the documents for this forgery. It was submitted that if one were to commit fraud, he/she would have taken note of the timing on the cash deposit slip and alter accordingly.

57     It was submitted by the accused during her cross-examination of PW3, she had testified that Poh Hin the office boy did use the cash deposit machine to deposit cash if there was a long queue at the bank. According to the accused, other staff had also deposited cash in this manner. It was further submitted that this overturns PW3’s assertions that the accused was the only one who used the cash deposit machine to deposit cash and that all the cash deposit slips had been forged by the accused. As such, it was the case for the defence that _Exhibit P4_ did not prove all the 29 charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

#### Invoice and tax receipts that were rubber stamped and dated by PW3

58     It was the case for the defence that according to the ‘Job Description’ document _Exhibit D1_, PW3 had confirmed that it was part of her job to receive cash delivered to Finance Department. It was submitted that PW3 had confirmed that she would acknowledge receipt of cash with her rubber stamp. PW3 had also confirmed that the accused had organized for a person from the Finance Department to be present to collect cash to avoid conflict of interest.

59     It was further submitted that the accused had always emphasized that someone from Finance Department except for the accused, must be present to collect the cash. It was highlighted that PW3 had confirmed that the staff would pass cash to PW3 after office hours. PW3 had also confirmed that she did the record keeping into MYOB system after receiving cash.

60     It was submitted that PW3 had confirmed that the accused was not always informed of cash receipt. It was highlighted that PW3 had asserted that she was unaware that half the time the accused was not at her desk as the latter had to attend to the auditors during the audit although each was kept informed of one’s whereabouts during office hours.

61     It was further submitted that PW3 had confirmed that she had assisted to download Excel sheets in the past and had printed them out[^18]. It was the case for the defence that PW3 had acknowledged that there was no proof or acknowledgement from the accused that she had passed cash to the accused[^19]. It was submitted that from PW3’s testimony during cross-examination there was no concrete evidence in _Exhibit P5_ to prove that the cash had been handed to the accused after PW3 acknowledged receipt of the cash from SHRI Academy’s managers. It was the case for the defence that _Exhibit P5_ did not serve to prove beyond reasonable doubt the case against the accused.

62     According to the accused, it was detailed clearly in _Exhibit D1_, that PW3’s job scope included cash receipt functions and updating records. PW3 would be the first person to be in touch with incoming cash. It was submitted that if PW3 did not mention of any cash received, no one in the Finance Department would be aware. It was further submitted that PW3 had acknowledged that she was the best person to respond to questions on receipt matters.

63     It was highlighted that a dummy receipt (at page 25 of _Exhibit P5_) had been issued by PW3 and she had insisted that the accused was aware of the circumstances[^20]. It was the case for the defence that the accused was not aware of the situation. It was further highlighted that PW3’s testified assumption was that the accused would be responsible for anything that goes wrong because of her responsibility as a superior.

64     It was the case for the defence that PW3 had confirmed that the Finance files are not password protected[^21].

#### PW3’s role in SHRI

65     It was highlighted that PW2 had testified that PW3 was very familiar with SHRI Academy Pte Ltd accounts. If Finance needed assistance or documents, they would usually rely on her. It was further submitted that PW3 provided the Excel sheets, had access and provided all “needed documents” and collects, handles and records incoming cash. It was also highlighted that with respect to PW3’s role over cash and recording, PW2 had testified that PW3 would do normal the updates of the bank receipt, issue bank receipt, file the bank receipt and organize some of the filing like other departments requesting for information.

66     It was submitted that the accused had groomed PW3 to learn accounts[^22]. It was further submitted that since the accused’s departure there was a change in PW3’s job scope[^23]. It was highlighted that although PW3 had asserted that she did not receive _Exhibit D1_, she had agreed that she was performing the tasks that were listed in the job scope.

67     In conclusion, the accused sincerely apologized for assuming _guilt as a servant_ too quickly and in a confused state of mind as she had wanted to move on and forget about the unpleasant episode of subordinate betrayal and unfeeling superiors.

68     She submitted that as she was of the view that as a supervisor she should be responsible for anything that had gone wrong, she had signed the “_29 statement of charges_” at the Bedok Police Station. She had further submitted it was also because she was informed that not all the charges would be proceeded with and some would be taken into consideration if she pleads guilty. According to her that helped her to make up her mind when she returned to the station to give another statement. It was highlighted that she had cried throughout the recording of the statements.

69     It was submitted being an internal and external auditor in the past, she needed to role play each scenario on state of matters, cause and eventual effect and result. Hence, she was able to piece together what would have gone wrong by looking at the evidence presented to her by the investigating officer (PW6). According to her, putting a story together would have been part of an auditor’s role play mode.

70     It was the case for the defence that after the cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses it became apparent to the accused that SHRI Academy was trying “to tag” her as the culprit and every witness had spoken in the same voice. It was submitted that even PW4 had testified that the accused did not inform him not to pass cash to her as it would be a conflict of interest. The accused maintained that all staff in SHRI had been informed of this and it was submitted that PW3 had confirmed this fact during her cross-examination[^24].

71     It was submitted that SHRI Academy had streamlined some parts of PW3’s job scope to limit potential casualties which could be seen during the 3-day trial that the accused had trusted her subordinates too much. It was further submitted that the accused was charged without SHRI undertaking an independent investigation, due justice, process of natural justice and reasonableness taking into consideration contributory circumstances and actions by others.

72     The accused maintained that the charges were made without due investigations into transactional SOPs and job descriptions. If indeed suspicions were detected that would constitute seriousness, it was submitted an independent financial audit could have been mounted. She queried as to whether an audit was done to establish beyond doubt the evidence and recommendations made to prevent future occurences.

73     It was highlighted by the accused that during the period from 4 February 2017 to 19 May 2017 when the charges were “levied”, the accused was pre-occupied with a number of urgent tasks in addition to her normal duties. According to the accused, she had invested much time and effort accumulating her knowledge and professionalism in accounting for the past 20 years. Honour, reputation and integrity meant much to the accused. In addition, the accused holds a real estate licence and employment agency’s Key Appointment Holder licence. It was submitted that it did not make sense for the accused to risk her hard-earned repute and licences.

74     It was the case for the defence that the evidence and the witnesses’ testimonies had not proved the 29 charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused had hoped that justice would prevail even though natural justice had not been observed by SHRI.

## F.   Prosecution’s Reply

#### The accused’s allegations against PW3

75     It was submitted that the accused had made various peripheral points in her closing submissions, insinuating that PW3 might not have passed the cash to her to be deposited in respect of the 28 transactions in question:

> (a)     It was PW3’s job to collect cash and PW3 did not always inform the accused that there was cash collected;

> (b)     If PW3 did not mention about any cash received, no one in the Finance Department would be aware;

> (c)     There was no written acknowledgement that the accused had indeed received the cash from PW3.

76     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused was being disingenuous. PW3 had given direct evidence that she had undoubtedly informed the accused of the receipt of the 28 sums of cash, which was then passed to the accused for deposit[^25]. It was submitted that in fact, the accused herself had corroborated PW3’s testimony that there was no written acknowledgement as they worked based on mutual trust:

> A    …But if here, she is saying that, uh, “Well, I passed to you, it’s not a practice to sign”, which is correct. It’s not our practice to sign because we trust each other that much.[^26]

77     It was further submitted that these peripheral points were clearly afterthoughts to bolster the accused’s defence, especially since she did not accuse PW3 of lying during her cross-examination. It was highlighted that she also did not raise these points in her previous statements in _Exhibit P9_ to _Exhibit P39_. It was the Prosecution’s case that in contrast given PW3’s cogent and logical answers throughout her testimony, it was submitted that PW3 was a credible witnesses and her testimony should be believed.

78     Related to the above, it was further submitted that the accused had also alleged that PW3 only _assumed_ that the accused was responsible for anything that went wrong since the accused was her superior. The accused had cited a portion of the Notes of Evidence to support her case:

> Q    If I re---understand that comment, everything would have come to me from your saying so. I do not get the initial of whatever you say. Anything that has gone wrong becomes my responsibility as a superior. Am I correct?

> A    Yes[^27].”

It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had improperly characterised PW3’s response. As was evident in PW3’s further cross-examination immediately following the above answer as shown below, she was not making any assumption, but was in fact testifying what had actually happened:

> Q    Which means that anything that is issued wrongly, eventually, I will have to be responsible?

> A     **No. Because this is exactly what it happened.** I’m not---I’m not saying whatever---whatever has to come to you but we worked on the basis that, whatever you will know. So, if this money is not banked in, you will know[^28].

#### The accused claimed that she had told everyone in SHRI not to pass cash to her

79     It was highlighted by the Prosecution that the accused had submitted that she had informed everyone in SHRI not to pass cash to her to avoid a conflict of interest. It was the Prosecution’s case that firstly, this issue was irrelevant as it relates to when the cash was first received from the receptionist or the programme managers and not when the cash was supposed to be deposited. Secondly, it was submitted that the accused clearly did not stick to this purported practice since she had admitted that she did accept cash when PW3 was not around[^29].

80     It was the Prosecution’s case that the evidence of the witnesses clearly rebutted the accused’s claim that she did not handle any cash. PW4 a programme manager during the material period had testified during cross-examination that he had never heard the accused say that she did not want to receive cash, and had in fact personally passed cash to her.

> Q    Have you heard me saying that, “Do not pass cash to Diana. Either pass it to Kath or to ‘Jennifer’ because there’s conflict of interest”?

> A    No.

> Q    No?

> A    But I did pass cash to you, ah.

> Q    Correct. But do you---do you---do you want to pass cash to me and I refuse to accept, because I tell you there’s conflict of interest? Wait until Kath comes back? Or wait until ‘Jennifer’ comes back?

> A    No.

81     It was submitted that PW3 had also testified during cross-examination that the accused never said that she did not want to receive cash, and had in fact told PW3 that she would deposit cash[^30]:

> Q    Because the whole company is aware that I do not want to touch cash. Cheques, you can pass to me because it’s just to pass to ‘Poh Hin’. Am I right?

> A    No

> Q    Can you explain why not?

> A    Because you have received cash when I was not there

> …

> Q    Okay. When ‘Poh Hin’ comes, what do you pass to him?

> A    Yes. If the cash is in the drawer that I have to pass to him the next day, I will pass to him.

> Q    Okay. If it’s not passed to him, then what will happen after that?

> A    I pass to you

> Q    Why would you pass to me?

> A    Because you say you’ll bank in.

82     It was highlighted by the Prosecution that the accused had submitted that all the witnesses from SHRI, including PW4 spoke in the “same voice” to “tag \[her\] as the culprit”. However, the accused had not put to PW4 during his cross-examination that he had colluded with the other witnesses, but had instead asserted during her own evidence that PW4 could have forgotten about this practice. It was the Prosecution’s case that there was no plausible motive for PW4 to frame the accused as he was no longer employed by SHRI.

#### The accused’s fanciful theories on how she would have committed the offences in another manner

83     It was submitted that the accused had claimed that if she had indeed committed the forgery offences, she would have distanced herself by omitting Bedok or Chai Chee as the location on the DBS transaction receipts in _Exhibit P4_, since those are near to her residential address. She had also claimed that had she been the perpetrator, she would have been more careful in altering the timings on the receipts. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s submissions were mere fanciful theories that she fabricated with the benefit of hindsight in order to conveniently explain away the incriminating evidence against her. The more straightforward and logical explanation of the receipts bearing “Bedok” or “Chai Chee” was that the accused had forged the receipts based on her old DBS transaction receipts collected from these places. Further, the fact that there are errors on the receipts does not mean anything since the accused could have been careless as she thought that her offences would not be discovered.

#### Jennifer Lee Siew Lian was not called as a witness

84     It was highlighted that the accused had submitted that Jennifer withdrew from being a Prosecution witness because having worked with the accused, Jennifer did not want testify in Court to “kill” the career of the accused. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s submission was baseless and merely speculative. In fact, the Prosecution had offered Jennifer as a witness to the accused but the accused did not elect to call her as a defence witness. It was submitted that in any case, Jennifer was not crucial witness as PW3 was the finance assistant handling the Academy aspect of SHRI.

#### SHRI did not carry out independent investigations against the accused

85     It was highlighted that the accused had alleged that SHRI breached the process of “natural justice” as they did not carry out any independent investigations against the accused. It was the Prosecution’s case that this allegation was not only irrelevant to the charges against the accused, but also clearly misguided. It was submitted that the complainant (PW1), who was then the executive director of SHRI, had testified that after he reported this matter to the President and treasurers of SHRI, they decided that the police, a neutral and independent party, were in the best position to conduct investigations.

86     It was further submitted that significantly, the accused was afforded full opportunities at multiple junctures to ventilate her defences: 1) in her long statements, 2) in her cautioned statements (with the benefit of the s 232 CPC warning), and 3) at trial.

#### The accused’s explanations of her confession statements were mere afterthoughts

87     It was submitted that the accused had conveniently alleged that she was in a state of “_flux and uncertainties…anxiety, confusion, depression and ignorance of the consequences_” when she made and signed the confession statements at the police station. It was the Prosecution’s case that these were mere afterthoughts to conveniently explain away the confession statements. As pointed out in the Prosecution’s closing submissions, these explanations should be rejected in the absence of any challenges against the voluntariness and accuracy of the statement, particularly given that the IO (PW6) had testified that the accused appeared normal and responsive during the statement-recording sessions.

88     In conclusion, it was submitted that the accused’s defence had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. It was emphasised that the accused defence was inconsistent, incredible and at times irrelevant. The Court was urged to find the accused guilty on all charges and to convict her accordingly.

## G.   Defence’s Reply

89     In response to the Prosecution’s submissions that PW3 had testified that at the material time the only people who were responsible for depositing cash were herself, Poh Hin, and the accused, the accused maintained that the cash would not have been passed to her according to the job scope in _Exhibit D1_. It was submitted that if PW3 did not mention receipt of cash to the accused, the accused would not have known that cash had been received by PW3. It was further submitted that PW3 would have been the only person who knew as she would rubber-stamp the documents to acknowledge the receipt of cash.

#### No opportunity nor need for PW3 to inform the accused of the cash received

90     In response to PW3’s evidence that she would inform the accused that there had been cash in the drawer, the accused submitted that during the period from February to May 2017, she would have been busy with the various tasks assigned. According to her, she would either be working from home in the morning, putting together the confidential documents for the ex-Executive Director’s investigations and would go to the office in the afternoon. It was submitted that the auditors would be auditing the books and the accused would need to be available to answer their questions.

91     According to the accused it was the first year ‘PKF’ had been appointed as auditors and she had to spend much time helping them understand how the operations were run for the three SHRI entities. She submitted that the auditors had requested for the audit of _Y2015_ and _Y2016_ via the MYOB accounting software and if she had committed any misdeeds she would not have made available the soft copies of the transactions and the accounting entries would be visible to trained auditors.

92     It was submitted that the accused had relied heavily on PW3 to look after the daily operations. According to her PW3 had to stay back to complete her work as the accused had returned home to carry on with her ongoing confidential investigation work on the ex-Executive Director. According to the accused PW3 would be the last person to leave the office. She had wanted PW3 to claim for over-time pay but the latter had declined stating that she only wanted to complete her work.

93     It was further submitted that there would have been no opportunity nor need for PW3 to inform the accused of the cash received as PW3 had been tasked to handle the day-to-day operations. The accused would vet the accounts and note the funds received for the end of the month when preparing the financial reporting for management. There had not been a need for the accused to see the cash during the work operations as PW3 had been tasked to handle day-to-day operations and the reconciliation of funds. It was the case for the Defence that the Prosecution had not provided proof that cash had been passed to the accused.

#### Photocopied DBS transcation receipts

94     In respect of the photocopied DBS transaction receipts, it was submitted that PW3 was very aware that receipts /slips printed on thermal paper would lose their ‘printing’ with the passage of time. Hence, the accused’s supervisor in-charge, Ms Ong Lay See who was in-charge of office automation had requested that photocopied documents be kept and not thermal receipts for ease of potential scanning and for storage.

#### Method of cash deposit

95     It was the case for the defence that throughout her testimony PW3 had portrayed that so long as the cash was not deposited via DBS counters, it would have been deposited by the accused. It was submitted that during cross-examination by the accused, PW3 had let slipped that Poh Hin the office boy did use the cash deposit machine. It was highlighted that this admission was different from what PW3 had testified when questioned by the Prosecution.

96     It was further submitted that as the accused did not have access to SHRI documents since her departure in May 2017, the accused could only base it on a documentary proof from Y2015 that showed that Poh Hin had also used the DBS deposit machine. It was highlighted that PW3 had subsequently admitted it as true during her cross-examination.

97     It was the case for the defence that though it happened in December 2015, SHRI had continued with practices from the past. It was submitted that ‘as advised’ by PW3 things did not change from 2017 until the day of giving testimony that things have stayed the same except minor changes. So using the DBS deposit machine to deposit cash could still be a practice by staff other than the accused. According to the accused, staff who would have ulterior motive could have used a past practice to forge a 2017 document as PKF was using the hard copies and soft copies for Y2015 and Y2016 audit.

98     In response to the Prosecution’s submissions that the accused had _admitted that she could have deposited cash in either 2014 or 2015 but was unable to specify when she last deposited cash_, the accused had disputed that it was an admission. According to the accused, she had joined SHRI in November 2014 and officially took over SHRI Academy Pte Ltd finance after the Finance Manager left in March 2015. She would have assisted with the depositing in the past or else the staff would not have used a “Chai Chee” deposit slip to forge another document for the 2017 deposit. It was submitted that if the accused had done the deed, she would have stayed away from using “Chai Chee” deposit slip and not draw attention to the location where she stayed.

#### The accused’s presence at the office

99     It was highlighted that the Prosecution had placed much emphasis on the days the accused had gone back to the office. It was submitted that the accused did not need to keep a log book of the hours she was away from the office as much of the confidential investigative work had to be done away from the office. It was further submitted that during her testimony in Court the accused was trying to picture the time frame based on needs and results. There had been no need to deny returning to the office. Furthermore, when the accused was back at the office she would be engaged with auditors most times and would hardly be around the Finance Department to look out for cash receipts. It was the case for the defence that this job scope was handled by PW3 and the accused did not have any concern over this. The accused did not need to ask PW3 for updates on funds received as the day-to-day operation had been assigned to PW3 including the training of the other part time finance girl.

100    In respect of the DBS deposit slip with the words “_17/4/17”_, “$1793.20” and “Haw Eh Htoo Ra” at page 22 of _Exhibit P4_, the accused had admitted that she had written those words. She explained that when preparing the financial reports, part of her job was to randomly check the data and rectify as necessary. She submitted that she had found the discrepancy of $6.80 and writing on the deposit slip was not equal to the accused depositing cash. According to her, she had made a note on the documents to rectify the $6.80 from the next deposit and had kept PW3 informed. She further submitted that as testified by PW2, financial records needed to be checked[^31].

#### PW3’s testimony

101    In response to the Prosecution’s submissions that PW3 was able to provide a straightforward and clear explanation on the amounts that was supposed to have been deposited, it was the case for the defence that this was so as PW3 was the only staff responsible for looking after SHRI Academy Finance matters. It was submitted that the Prosecution had not shown evidence to prove that cash was given to the accused for deposit after PW3 had stamped the receipt of cash. It was further submitted that it was illogical that the accused had requested to deposit the cash during the period when there were many immediate tasks with timelines to complete. According to her, there was a change in Executive Director and Council members after the AGM on 31 March 2017 and the accused was involved in much administrative liaison with the new office-bearers and preparing Y2017 forecast. The accused then went on to list her tasks and submitted that much of her time was spent commuting between the two offices and PW3 was left to take care of matters at the new office to have a smooth day-to-day operation.

102    It was submitted that PW3 had not shown proof to substantiate her explanation that she had passed cash to the accused especially when handling all cash for depositing into SHRI bank account was part of her job scope. It was further submitted that as part of the _standing operating procedures (SOP)_, staff in SHRI had been informed that they should not pass cash to the accused as there was conflict of interest. According to the accused, this could be verified with SHRI as all staff at SHRI had been told regularly, not just to one or two bodies. Hence, they would always seek out PW3 or the other ‘finance girl’ to acknowledge receipt of incoming funds.

103    In addition, according to the accused when none of the ‘finance girls’ were around, the accused would ask the program manager to return later. If the accused received on their behalf, the cash would still remain in the same envelope passed by the program manager and then passed to either PW3 or the ‘other finance girl’ subsequently as they started work from 9.00 am to 9.30 am daily. She submitted that she started work at 10:30 am and by the time she reported to work, PW3 or the ‘other finance girl’ would have cleared the cash and/or cheques to the office boy (Poh Hin) to deposit. According to the accused this was the SOP and had been followed.

104    It was submitted in respect of the instance of $1,800 cited by the Prosecution, it could not be done any differently. According to her whenever there was ‘coin change’ required (in this instance $6.80), the program manager would either have returned the small change to the respective student or told the student to get the change when the course started. This was part of the SOP that would be handled by PW3 and the program manager and would have been transparent to the accused. The accused only needed to ensure that the amount deposited was equal to the amount of course fees. Any difference would have to be managed by PW3.

105    It was further submitted that there was a coin box in the accused’s top drawer tray and PW3 and the ‘other finance girl’ were able to use that for small change for any student if the need arose. This drawer was not locked and both girls could access. According to the accused from the date of the transaction in April 2017 to the date of the trial in August 2019, there was a passage of time of 28 months. It was the case for the defence that unless there was something special about the instance, what the accused had elaborated on at trial was part of the SOP such as returning small change to the program manager or student was a regular affair in local Singapore currency that involved coins and exchange rate conversion.

106    As this was part of the day-to-day operation, the accused’s special attention would not have been drawn to it. According to the accused there were other such instances of coin exchanges in the past for amounts deposited as ‘round dollar’ and coin exchange deducted subsequently. This was a regular occurrence and not sinister and crafty on the part of the accused. The SOP was set up to run operations efficiently and not to constrain the working staff. The staff were expected to be “street smart” to get their job done for the same results and not to be hindered by protocol and unnecessary restrictions and to work with integrity. It was submitted that all the above could easily be verified by PW3.

#### The accused’s statements

107    It was submitted that the accused did not challenge the accuracy or recording procedure as the accused was distressed, sad and crying all the way. According to her, she was not in a normal state when she was signing the charge sheets even though PW6 had testified otherwise. It was the case for the defence that PW6 had assisted the accused to complete the comments to quickly finish the session as the process was painful. She further submitted that when she had wanted to plead guilty as a servant, she was informed that AGC office would take some charges into consideration and that the accused would not need to serve the full sentence.

108    It was the case for the defence that being accounting trained, she had mistakenly extrapolated and calculated that the penalty for $43,336 would not be heavy and believed that she could quickly move on with her life and forget about the betrayal of subordinates and unappreciative attitude of SHRI management. She submitted that she had not cross-examined PW6 as he had been kind, understanding and helpful throughout the statement recordings and that she would be stating her own defence in the witness box.

#### Retraction of confessions

109    The accused highlighted that she had sought to retract all 30 confession statements and apologized for the change in position. According to her, she still had feelings for SHRI. Nevertheless, after the passage of time and encountering various difficulties, by then all feelings of “_pleading guilty as a servant_” had disappeared as it did not made practical sense to her anymore. The accused decided to claim trial to clear her good name as being a servant was no longer applicable if the employer was not appreciative.

#### Contents of the accused’s statements

110    It was submitted that the accused had more than 30 years of work experience in accounting and had been an internal and external auditor. According to her in these roles, it is a requirement to envisage the process flow and ‘thoughts of events’ and the cause and effect. When giving the statements at Bedok Police Station, the accused had thought through the process of flow of how the deposits would have come about. Hence, she gave the detailed description of what could have potentially happened. According to her, before that she had a teenager named Ann who had assisted her with her other businesses. It was the case for the defence that putting a ‘name’ to the process flow was also part of the thought process.

111    In conclusion, the accused had submitted that there was no chance for her to collect evidence from SHRI in support of her defence. She was locked out of all email and server when she was told that she was rightsized out in May 2017 with two months’ in lieu of notice pay. She could only rely on cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses as trying to get her own witnesses proved to be difficult and pricey.

112    It was the case for the defence that the Prosecution’s closing submissions had not proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, the witnesses’ accounts had been verbal and there had been no conclusive evidence. It was submitted the use of old DBS cash receipts to forge new ones was pure speculation by the Prosecution. There was no direct evidence that during the period in question cash was handed to the accused as she was pre-occupied with many things outside the Finance Department and PW3 had been put in-charge of finance day-to-day operation. What was submitted was _Exhibit P3_, the DBS bank statements in Excel format which the accused had downloaded and saved in the server drive for anyone to use. They were there for staff to use and edit according to their needs. According to her, anyone who knew Microsoft would be able to edit and insert lines on the Excel format. The accused urged the Court to return a not guilty verdict on the accused.

## H.   Assessment of Evidence

113    The accused had claimed trial to _one charge_ of criminal breach of trust as a servant under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) in **DAC 935479 -2017** and _28 charges_ of forgery under s 465 of the Penal Code in **DAC 935451 - 2017** to **DAC 935478 - 2017**.

114    In view of the undisputed facts as set out at paragraph 9 above, the main issues before me was whether:

> (a)     between February 2017 to May 2017, the accused was the employee who had misappropriated cash amounting to $43,329.20 belonging to SHRI which was supposed to have been deposited into SHRI’s DBS bank current account No: XXX and

> (b)     between February 2017 to May 2017, the accused had forged the 28 DBS transaction receipts that were handed to PW3 as proof of deposit.

115    To prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the Prosecution had adduced both documentary and oral evidence through its six witnesses as well as the accused’s own confessions in a statement recorded under s 22 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.) (“CPC”) and 29 statements recorded under s 23 of the CPC. Essentially it was the Prosecution’s case that between February 2017 to May 2017, PW3 had informed the accused of the receipt of the 28 sums of cash amounting to $43,329.20 from the students of SHRI Academy Pte Ltd and the cash was handed to the accused to be deposited into SHRI’s DBS bank current account. Subsequently, the accused had personally passed to PW3 28 forged DBS bank transaction receipts in the photocopied form as proof of deposit and told PW3 that she had deposited cash at the cash deposit machine when in fact she had misappropriated the cash. The Prosecution had also applied for the impeachment of the accused’s credit pursuant to s 157(c) of the Evidence Act on the basis that her former police statements were materially inconsistent with her evidence at trial.

116    As the accused was the only witness for the defence, to establish her case she had given oral evidence and tendered the ‘Job Description’ of a Senior Manager Finance dated 1 February 2016 (_Exhibit D1_) as part of her documentary evidence. The main thrust of her defence was that she had not forged the documents not had she misappropriated the monies. In addition, she had also retracted her confessions in her police statements on the basis that she was not in a normal state of mind when she gave the statements, she still had feelings for SHRI and had pleaded guilty as a servant as she felt responsible for the acts of her subordinates.

117    It was also the case for the defence that she had admitted to the commission of these offences in her police statements as she had mistakenly extrapolated and calculated that the penalty for $43,336 would not be heavy and she had believed that it would enable her to quickly move on with her life and forget about the betrayal of subordinates and the unappreciative attitude of the SHRI management.

118    In my assessment of the evidence, I was mindful that the present charges against the accused arose after her former employer SHRI discovered discrepancies in the SHRI Academy Pte Ltd DBS Account No: XXX relating to 28 transactions of cash deposits that were not reflected in the DBS bank statements in _Exhibit P2_ from February 2017 to May 2017. At the material time, the accused was the Head of the Finance Department while both PW3 and Jennifer were both part-timers at SHRI who reported to the accused. PW1 had lodged a police report on 8 August 2017 (_Exhibit P1_) after the management of SHRI decided that the police would be the neutral and independent party to conduct the investigations.

119    I noted that prior to that, SHRI had terminated the accused’s services as Senior Finance Manager on 23 May 2017 as she was deemed redundant during an exercise to streamline the roles and responsibilities of the Finance and Human Resource Departments of SHRI. When PW1 joined SHRI on 3 April 2017, the company had incurred significant financial losses and his job was to turn the company around. It was unchallenged that PW2 had discovered the discrepancies in the SHRI Academy Pte Ltd’s bank account only after she took over the accused’s role in the Finance Department and after the accused had already left SHRI in May 2017.

120    In the present case, I noted that it was unchallenged that the 28 DBS bank transaction receipts marked collectively as _Exhibit P4_ were forged. The accused herself had testified that she could tell from her own experience in compliance review that the documents were forged. I was also mindful that it was unchallenged that cash amounting to $43,329.20 belonging to SHRI had been misappropriated by an employee of SHRI. What I had to determine was whether the Prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had forged the 28 DBS bank transactions receipts and had misappropriated $43,329.20 belonging to SHRI. Before making these determinations, I will firstly deal with the Prosecution’s application to impeach the accused’s credit.

#### Application to impeach the credit of the accused

121    In the course of the trial, the Prosecution had applied to have the accused’s credit impeached under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, Rev. Ed. 1997). This was in light of the material discrepancies in key factual issues between her testimony and her police statements. The Prosecution had highlighted two main inconsistencies in the accused’s version of events in her long statement (_Exhibit P39_) and her defence at trial as set out at paragraph 43 above.

122    I noted that when the accused was confronted with the material inconsistencies between her testimony and her long statement in _Exhibit P39_, the accused had admitted that she had intentionally lied in that statement. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had not provided any satisfactory explanations for her lies. The accused had claimed that she lied because she was feeling disappointed and sad when she found out that somebody in her department had committed fraud, and had wanted to assume guilt by taking the responsibility for the missing monies as it happened under her supervision. I also agreed with the Prosecution that this explanation was illogical she did not in fact take responsibility for the offences but had instead pushed the responsibility to “Ann”.

123    The accused had also explained that she had lied because she was stunned and had stated “whatever comes to mind” as a possible scenario of what could have happened so that she could subsequently find out what actually happened. I agreed with the Prosecution that this explanation was illogical and that it was highly unusual for the first thought of an innocent person to concoct a convoluted lie rather than to simply state the truth.

124    I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused was stubborn and evasive in answering questions when confronted with her previous inconsistent statement. As I was not satisfied with the convoluted and evasive explanations provided by the accused for the material inconsistencies between her testimony and her police statements, I found that the accused’s credit has been impeached under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act.

#### Retraction of accused’s confessions in her statements

125    I will next deal with the retraction of her confessions by the accused that were contained in her unchallenged police statements. After having considered the explanations provided by the accused, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had not provided any credible explanations for her change of position at trial. To my mind, it was clear that her reasons for doing so were merely afterthoughts in order to downplay the significance of her confessions and to avoid the consequences of her own actions.

126    Based on the evidence before me, I saw no reason to disbelieve the IO’s (PW6) testimony that the accused was normal and responsive during the recording of the cautioned statements, and that she did not appear unwell, confused, or nervous throughout the recording of the statements. I noted that PW6 was not subjected to any cross-examination by the accused and the accused’s assertion of her alleged state of mind during the recording of the statement were never put to PW6. I also noted that she was able to provide relevant details of the offences to the recording officer (PW6) over the span of 1.5 hours. Consequently, I did not accept her claim that she was ignorant of the consequences of providing such police statements as it was evident that PW6 had duly read and explained the warnings and potential punishment of the s 408 and s 465 Penal Code offences.

127    I agreed with the Prosecution that the only reason that the accused had given such a detailed explanation in _Exhibit P9_ and the further confessions in _Exhibit P10_ to _Exhibit P38_ was because she had misappropriated the cash and forged the 28 DBS transaction receipts. As no credible reasons were provided by the accused for the change in position at trial, I gave full weight to the accused’s statements in _Exhibit P9_ to _Exhibit P38_.

128    I now turn to the main issues for my determination.

129    In the present case, after a careful assessment of the evidence before me, as I found PW3 to be a credible and forthright witness, I accepted her evidence that between February 2017 to May 2017 the accused, Poh Hin and PW3 were the only ones who had deposited cash belonging to SHRI Academy Pte Ltd into its DBS current account. I also accepted her evidence that whenever PW3 or Poh Hin deposited the cash, they would submit the DBS cash deposit slip with the additional bank’s machine print that showed the bank-in date and the amount deposited over-the-counter at the DBS bank as proof of the deposit. In contrast, whenever the accused deposited the cash, she would hand to PW3 a photocopied DBS transaction receipt and a cash deposit slip without a bank machine print showing the amount deposited and the bank-in date as evidenced by the documents in _Exhibit P4_.

130    Although the accused had sought to distance herself from any involvement in the deposit of cash into the SHRI’s DBS bank account, interestingly in her closing submissions the accused had sought to justify the use of a photocopied transaction receipt on the basis that such receipts printed on thermal paper would lose their legibility with the passage of time and it was a request by the accused’s then supervisor in-charge, Ms Ong Lay See that photocopied documents be kept and not thermal receipts for ease of potential scanning and for storage. Nevertheless, I noted that no evidence on this aspect of her submission was adduced through any of the witnesses from SHRI or previously from SHRI nor was PW3 specifically asked any questions on this aspect. Hence, I placed no weight on this aspect of her submissions.

131    In addition, I also accepted PW3’s evidence that between February 2017 to May 2017 she had informed the accused of the receipt of the 28 sums of cash amounting to $43,329.20 from the students of SHRI Academy Pte Ltd and cash was handed to the accused for her to deposit into SHRI’s DBS bank account. I was mindful that it was unchallenged that the accused had deposited cash for SHRI when she took over as Senior Manager Finance but was unable to specify when she last deposited cash. I agreed with the Prosecution that her denial of being involved in the deposit of the 28 sums of cash was not only contradicted by PW3’s testimony but also internally inconsistent with her own statements _Exhibit P9_ and _Exhibit P39_ where she stated that she was involved in depositing cash at the material time.

132    Consequently, I rejected the accused’s assertion that she had not handled the 28 sums of cash intended for deposit into SHRI’s bank account as she was busy with many things outside the Finance Department such as conducting investigative work on the former executive director. I further rejected her assertion that PW3 was the only staff responsible for looking after SHRI Academy Finance matters. As the Senior Finance Manager at SHRI who was at work every day with only one part-time staff namely, PW3 handling SHRI Academy Pte Ltd matters, I found that it was highly unlikely for the accused not to have had to handle the receipt of cash belonging to SHRI Academy Pte Ltd or ensured its deposit into the company’s bank account.

133    Accordingly, based on PW3’s evidence that were corroborated by the accused’s own statements, I found that on the facts that cash amounting to $43,329.20 belonging to SHRI Academy Pte Ltd had been passed to the accused for deposit into the SHRI’s DBS bank account. As it was unchallenged that the deposit of cash amounting to $43,329.20 belonging to SHRI did not take place between February 2017 to May 2017 and the accused had admitted in her police statements in _Exhibit P9_ and _Exhibit P39_ that she had misappropriated the monies, I found that the accused had misappropriated the said cash amounting to $43,329.20.

134    I further accepted PW3’s evidence that the accused had passed all the documents in _Exhibit P4_ to her and found that all 28 pages in _Exhibit P4_ were related to the said 28 sums of cash that been given by her to the accused. As it was undisputed that the DBS transaction receipts were forged and the accused in her statement at _Exhibit P9_ and _Exhibit P39_ had described how she had forged the said receipts, I found that the accused had forged the 28 DBS transaction receipts that she handed to PW3 as proof of deposit between February 2017 to May 2017. Although the accused had sought to explain her statements that being an internal and external auditor in the past she had to role play each scenario on state of matters, cause and eventual effect and result and was able to piece together what would have gone wrong by looking at the evidence presented to her by the investigating officer (PW6), I rejected her explanation and was of the view these were afterthoughts on her part to downplay her culpability. Hence, I did not accept her explanation that she had given a detailed description of what _could have potentially happened_ when she gave the statements.

135    I was mindful of the accused had submitted that during the material period, she had to attend to the auditors who had requested for the audit of _Y2015_ and _Y2016_ via the MYOB accounting software. According to the accused, she would not have made available the soft copies of the transactions and the accounting entries as it would have been visible to trained auditors if she had committed any misdeeds. In my view, nothing turns on this assertion as this was in respect of financial records prior to the commission of the offences that were not relevant to the present charges.

136    In my assessment of the totality of evidence before me, I was mindful that in the conduct of her defence as well as her closing submissions, the accused had sought to adduce facts on matters unsupported by evidence, introduce irrelevant facts and had made uncorroborated speculative assertions against the Prosecution’s witnesses. As the evidence had not been properly adduced, I had not placed any weight on such facts or speculative assertions or disregarded them where necessary.

137    Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I found that the Prosecution had established its case beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused as an employee of SHRI had misappropriated cash amounting to $43,329.20 by forging 28 DBS bank transaction receipts in order to conceal the fact that she had misappropriated the cash. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty on all of the 29 proceeded charges in **DAC 935451 - 2017** to **DAC 935479 - 2017** and convicted her.

It was submitted that from the sentencing table, generally, for untraced accused persons who had committed criminal breach of trust as a servant for the sum involving $40,000 to $45,000, the sentence received was around 12 months’ imprisonment.

141    It was further submitted that in the present case, given that the accused had claimed trial and had been convicted, she would not be entitled to a sentencing discount for cases where the accused had pleaded guilty and sought an uplift to at least 15 months’ imprisonment.

142    In respect of the forgery charges, the Prosecution had tendered a sentencing table involving various sums being forged.

143    It was submitted that the sentences would range from between four weeks’ imprisonment to three months’ imprisonment regardless of how low the sum is. The Prosecution highlighted that in _PP v Ho Wei Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 121</span> a case involving an accused who forged a HDB season parking label causing a loss of $88, he was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment.

144    It was further submitted that the range of sentences sought by the Prosecution were as follows:

> ·    For the charges involving $5,000 and above, the Prosecution was seeking at least four months’ imprisonment;

> ·    For charges involving $4,000 plus - at least three months’ imprisonment;

> ·    For charges involving $1,000 to $4,000, - at least two months’ imprisonment and

> ·    For charges involving less than $1,000 - at least four weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Global sentence

145    The Prosecution had urged the Court to order two of the forgery charges to run consecutively, namely the charge involving $4,000 plus where at least three months imprisonment should be imposed as well as another charge of where at least two months imprisonment should be imposed.

146    It was submitted that in the present case, the forged documents involved DBS receipts which are for financial institutions and it was because of these receipts that the accused was able to perpetuate her offences for a long period of time. It was further submitted that given that the accused faced 28 forgery charges and one criminal breach of trust charge, it was therefore justified for three of the sentences to run consecutively.

## K.   Mitigation

147    In her written plea in mitigation, the accused made several references to points that were earlier raised in her closing and reply submissions. It was submitted that she had decided to claim trial as she had sincerely believed that the truth would prevail and she would not be found guilty.

148    It was submitted that the global sentence proposed by the Prosecution based on plead guilty cases was questionable as the accused did not plead guilty.

149    It was further submitted that the past two years of waiting had caused the accused’s health to deteriorate fast. Presently, the accused is on medication for high blood pressure and is physically unfit. She needs to take muscle relaxants as she is suffering from the onset of osteoporosis.

150    According to her, the past two years of waiting for trial has also taken a heavy toll on building the accused’s retirement fund and old age financial adequacy due to low menial work with no or very much less CPF contribution. Having to stand for long hours working as a banquet server had caused back and feet problems on top of the emotional stress that she suffers during this period.

151    In conclusion, the accused still maintained her innocence.

## L.   Prosecution’s Reply

152    In response to the accused’s written plea in mitigation, it was highlighted by the Prosecution that the mitigation plea made reference to most of the points in the accused’s closing and reply submissions. It was submitted that these points should be disregarded as they were still the accused’s points in resisting the charges

153    It was further submitted that the issues about the accused’s physical health as well as old age should not be considered as mitigating factors. This was not a case where the exercise of judicial mercy is proper. Furthermore, according to the Prosecution the accused would still be able to receive adequate medical attention in prison.

## M.   The Sentences

#### Prescribed punishment for criminal breach of trust as a servant or clerk

154    The prescribed punishment for an offence of criminal breach of trust as a servant or a clerk under s 408 of the Penal Code is a mandatory term of imprisonment of up to 15 years with the additional option of a fine. As this is an aggravated form of criminal breach of trust, the seriousness of such offences is evident from its prescribed mandatory imprisonment term.

155    The relevant factors that a Court would consider in sentencing for such offences would include:

> \*    Whether the offender a public official/ professional or the breach of trust placed in offender in ordinary course of business;

> \*    The impact on public confidence/particularly in commercial/ financial institution;

> \*    The sum of money/ value of property involved;

> \*    The degree of trust reposed in offender, including his rank/ status;

> \*    The offence perpetrated over period of time or in succession;

> \*    Organised group offence;

> \*    Succumbed to sudden temptation;

> \*    Cast suspicion on others;

> \*    Whether the integrity and reputation of Singapore affected.

156    In the present case, as the accused had misappropriated the total sum of $43,329.20 as an employee of SHRI and had claimed trial to the charge, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of at least 15 months’ imprisonment which was an uplift from the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment imposed for plead guilty cases. In support of their submission, the Prosecution had tendered sentencing precedents for plead guilty cases involving similar amounts as set out at paragraph 140 above.

157    In my consideration of the appropriate sentence to be imposed for **_DAC 935479-2017_**, I took into account the amount involved, the fact that the offence was perpetrated over a period of four months, the fact that the accused was a Senior Finance Manager at the material time and that the accused was a first offender. I also took into account the fact that the accused remained unremorseful for her acts despite her conviction as she continued to maintain her innocence in her written plea in mitigation.

158    From the table of sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution, I noted that the sentences imposed for plead guilty offences for sums involving $40,000 to $45,000 appeared to be 12 months’ imprisonment. Nevertheless, as the cases were unreported cases and there were no written grounds of decisions given in these cases, I was mindful of the lack of precedential value for unreported cases although it provided some reference as to the range of sentences imposed for offences.

159    After a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the charge before me, I imposed a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment for **_DAC 935479-2017_**. In my view, the sentence was just and appropriate to reflect the need for general deterrence for other like-minded offenders as well as her level of culpability for the present case. The accused was not entitled to any sentencing discount as she had elected to claim trial to the charge and hence an uplift of two months’ imprisonment from the starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment was warranted.

#### Prescribed punishment for forgery

160    The prescribed punishment for an offence of forgery under s 465 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment which may extend to four years or with fine, or to both.

161    The relevant factors that a Court would consider in sentencing for such offences would include:

> \*    The nature of the documents;

> \*    Whether there were multiple charges / victims;

> \*    The offences were premeditated;

> \*    Syndicated;

> \*    Professionalism;

> \*    Whether the integrity and reputation of Singapore affected;

> \*    Abuse of position or trust;

> \*    Large amount;

> \*    Committed over a period of time;

> \*    Fraud on the authorities;

> \*    Malicious intent

162    In my consideration of the appropriate sentences to be imposed, I took into account the facts that the accused had claimed trial to 28 charges of forgery, the amounts involved for the individual charges ranged from $107 to $5646 while the total sum involved was $43,329.20, the accused was a Senior Finance Manager at the material time and that the accused was a first offender. I was mindful that the forged documents involved a large number of DBS transcription receipts from a financial institution and the accused had perpetuated her offences over a period of four months.

163    From the table of sentencing precedents tendered by the Prosecution, I noted that the sentences imposed for plead guilty cases ranged form 4 weeks’ to three months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution had urged the Court to impose sentences from 4 weeks’ to three months’ imprisonment based on the range as set out at paragraph 144 above.

164    After a careful consideration of the Prosecution’s address on sentence, the written plea in mitigation as well as the factual matrix of the 28 charges before me, I imposed the following range of sentences:

> (i)     For charges involving sums below $1,000, a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment per charge;

> (ii)     For charges involving sums above $1,000 and up to $3,000, a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment per charge;

> (iii)     For charges involving sums above $4,000, a sentence of ten weeks’ imprisonment per charge and

> (iv)     For charges involving sums above $5,000, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment per charge.

The complete breakdown of the sentences imposed have been set out earlier at paragraph 4 above. In my view, the range of sentences imposed were just and appropriate to reflect the need for general deterrence for other like-minded offenders as well as her level of culpability for the present case.

## Global sentence

165    After having decided on the individual sentences, I had to decide which of the sentences should run consecutively. This was because by virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), I must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

166    In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution given that the accused faced 28 forgery charges and one criminal breach of trust charge, it was therefore justified for three of the sentences to run consecutively. This would be reflective of the overall criminality of the accused conduct. Hence, I ordered the sentences for **DAC 935451 - 2017**, **DAC 935456 - 2017** and **DAC 935479 - 2017** to run consecutively. The global sentence imposed on the accused was seventeen months’ and six weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 28 November 2019.

167    Dissatisfied with my decision, the accused had filed a Notice of Appeal against her conviction and sentences in respect of **DAC 935451 - 2017** to **DAC 935479 - 2017** on 28 November 2019. She is presently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal.
