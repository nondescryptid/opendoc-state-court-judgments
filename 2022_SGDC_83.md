### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The Accused was named Ng Kian Soon when he claimed trial before me on a single, amalgamated charge. Subsequently (on a date after Verdict was rendered in this trial) he changed his name to Huang Zheng Yan. I shall refer to him as the “Accused” in these Grounds.

2       The Accused was alleged to have cheated one female, Ng Yue Zhi (“NYZ”) on 31 occasions between August 2012 and January 2013. The Accused was alleged to have, on those 31 occasions, deceived NYZ into believing that he “intended to buy over a shophouse and that she (NYZ) could invest as a shareholder in such shophouse”. The Accused was alleged to have thereby dishonestly induced NYZ to deliver various sums of money to him. The aggregate amount alleged to have been received by the Accused as a result of the alleged cheating came to a total sum of $77,980. The 31 occasions and the individual sums alleged to have been paid to the Accused as a result of the alleged cheating were set out in an Annex to the Charge.

3       Prior to the trial before me, the Accused faced 31 separate charges, relating to the alleged 31 occasions. Just before the trial before me commenced, the Prosecution amended the first of these 31 charges; this amended charge is the amalgamated charge the Accused faced at trial. The other 30 charges relating to NYZ were stood down.

4       The original 31 charges set out, as the statement the Accused allegedly deceived NYZ into believing, as follows: that the Accused was “going to set up a spa business” and alleged that the Accused “requested her (NYZ) to invest as a shareholder”.

5       The amended charge amended the element of the alleged deceptive inducement to the version set out in \[2\] above. Now, at trial, the Accused was alleged to have deceived NYZ into believing that he “intended to buy over a shophouse and that she (NYZ) could invest as a shareholder in such shophouse”. This would (now) be the allegation the Accused had to answer and defend at trial.

6       During the trial, the material evidence emanated from NYZ and the Accused. After hearing all the evidence and after considering all the closing submissions by the parties, I found that the Prosecution had failed to prove its case against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It would have been unsafe to convict the Accused based on the evidence presented. I therefore ordered a Discharge Amounting to an Acquittal (“DATA”) on the single, amalgamated Charge (hereinafter, reference to the “Charge” relates to this single, amalgamated Charge tried before me). The Prosecution thereafter applied to withdraw the other 30 charges. With regard these other 30 charges, DATA was also ordered. The Prosecution appealed against the order of acquittal for the proceeded Charge.

7       The 31 occasions set out in the Charge span the period from 27 August 2012 to 5 January 2013. A Statement of Agreed Facts (“SOAF”) was tendered and marked “A”. In the SOAF, the Defence agreed that the Accused had received the 31 payments as set out in the Annex to the Charge on the dates as set out. The SOAF had an annex (marked as “Annex A”) setting out in detail how these payments were effected. The majority of the payments were bank account to bank account transfer transactions. Some of the payments were cash deposits into the bank account of the Accused. The last category of payment modes was straight payment of cash by NYZ to the hands of the Accused.

8       Sometime after the SOAF was tendered, the Defence sought to withdraw their agreement to the matters stated and earlier agreed to in the SOAF. The Prosecution were not agreeable to such withdrawal. I heard parties on this point and subsequently dismissed the Defence’s attempt to withdraw their earlier consent to the tendering of the SOAF into evidence (and the consequent admission therein).

9       Before delivering the Verdict and acquitting the Accused, I made the following oral remarks (set out in \[10\] to \[22\] hereinafter).

10     “These are brief oral remarks before I deliver the Verdict for this matter. These remarks do not constitute the full judgment nor the full grounds of decision, and may be added to or elaborated upon, should the need arise.

11     “The Accused faced a single Amalgamated Charge alleging that he had cheated the alleged victim (“NYZ”) on 31 occasions between August 2012 and January 2013. The total amounts that the Accused is alleged to have cheated NYZ of, totalled $77,980. The Accused had originally faced 31 separate charges for these 31 separate occasions. In these earlier charges, the Accused was alleged to have deceived NYZ into believing that (paraphrasing) “(the Accused) (was) going to set up a spa business and requested (NYZ) to invest as a shareholder”.

12     “The first of these 31 charges was subsequently amended to frame the Amalgamated Charge. In the Amalgamated Charge, the nature of the alleged deception was materially amended to now read that the Accused was alleged to have deceived NYZ into believing that (paraphrasing) “(the Accused) intended to buy over a shophouse and that (NYZ) could invest as a shareholder in such shophouse”. The other 30 charges setting out the single alleged acts of cheating were stood down for the trial on the Amalgamated Charge to proceed.

13     “The last alleged act of deception was said to have taken place in January 2013. The Accused was only charged in Court on 5 July 2018, more than 5 years later. The matter was fixed for trial (before another District Judge) on 23 October 2019 but could not proceed due to the illness of NYZ. By the time the trial before me commenced on 6 October 2020, more than 7 years had elapsed since the last alleged act of deception.

14     “With such a long lapse between the last alleged act of deception, it was not surprising that NYZ could not remember several material aspects of what had transpired between the Accused and herself. As stated above, the Accused was charged more than 5 years after the final alleged act. The trial for this matter was scheduled to begin in October 2019, a lapse of more than 6 years.

15     “The Prosecution is correct to characterise this as a situation where the alleged victim’s evidence and testimony has to be “unusually convincing”. The Prosecution had also pointed to several different and possibly conflicting accounts given by the Accused. In a Criminal trial, the Prosecution has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The Defence does not have to prove its case; the Defence only has to raise a reasonable doubt in order to obtain an acquittal.

16     “As stated above, the original allegation faced by the Accused was that he had deceived NYZ into believing that he was “going to set up a spa business” and had requested NYZ “to invest as a shareholder”. This was subsequently amended to the present allegation that he had deceived NYZ into believing that he had “intended to buy over a shophouse” and that NYZ “could invest as a shareholder in such shophouse”. This was a material change (from investing in a spa business, to investing in a shophouse). At the trial, the Prosecution had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Accused had indeed cheated NYZ by deception on the said 31 occasions into believing that NYZ could invest “as a shareholder in such shophouse”.

17     “In the Police Report made by NYZ on 27 August 2013 (a document made more contemporaneously than her oral testimony in Court), NYZ had alleged that the Accused had, (on 20 September 2013) asked her if she wanted to “join in to buy over the shophouse itself”. The year stated, “2013” was likely a typographical error, and the material date was probably meant to read “20 September 2012”. In her Police Report, NYZ alleged that she had made payments “until the month of May 2013, and she cites a figure of $85,380. It must be noted that the alleged acts of cheating faced by the Accused spanned the period from August 2012 to January 2013, and the total sums he is alleged to have cheated NYZ of, amounted to $77,980.

18     “Further, in her Police Report, NYZ alleged that, “However, there are amount of about over S$100,000 which I had also transferred to (the Accused) and the amount can be shown via my bank statement.” It is not clear whether NYZ is, in total, alleging that she had paid the Accused a grand total of $185,380, or whether the sum of $100,000 represented the total sum she had paid the Accused. In either event, these sums are far in excess of the $77,980 the Accused is alleged to have been paid by NYZ.

19     “As pointed out by the Defence, if the alleged deception began only in or about 20 September 2012, then several of the payments (at least the first 8 payments as listed out in the Annex {to the Charge}) could not have been as a result of this alleged deception. As asserted by the Defence, there were other reasons NYZ had made payments to the Accused. As stated above, the Defence need not prove its defence. There could well have been other reasons as to why NYZ had made these 31 payments. It is also notable that she had not stated in her Police Report, that the Accused had also made some payments to her.

20     “There was evidence that NYZ had been involved in business before. It is thus possibly doubtful that she had continued making these payments solely for the purpose of investing in the shophouse, without even insisting on (as opposed to simply asking for) knowing the identity and location of this investment, the total amount of her intended investment share or the value of the investment target, the exact amount that was payable as lawyers’ fees. NYZ had also never seen clear documentation or even informal written agreement for the investment she alleged she was making.

21     “The 31 sums made over to the Accused were also random and in disparate amounts, possibly not indicative of an investment. There is a distinct possibility that some, if not all, of these payments were for other purposes. If indeed the Accused had cheated NYZ, it would not be possible to ascertain which of these payments had been for the purposes of investment in the shophouse.

22     “Upon a consideration of all the evidence, whilst it is recognised that the Accused had given possibly inconsistent accounts, it cannot be said that NYZ was an “unusually convincing” witness. Nor can it be said that the Prosecution’s case, as framed within the Amalgamated Charge, was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Accused must therefore be found not guilty of the Charge. There will therefore be a Discharge Amounting to an Acquittal for DAC-921827-2018.” (end of the oral remarks).

23     It has to be emphasised that the time lapse between the alleged offences and the taking of oral evidence was obviously a major contributing factor to the conclusion that NYZ was not an “unusually convincing” witness. As stated in \[13\] above, the Accused was first charged in Court on 5 July 2018, more than 5 years after the final alleged act of cheating (on 5 January 2013). By the time the trial before me commenced, more than 7 years had elapsed from the final alleged act of cheating.

24     It was not unexpected then, that NYZ’s memory of the events was far from clear, cogent or convincing. The Prosecution’s case was of course assisted by the admissions made in the SOAF. As indicated earlier, the Defence had subsequently sought to withdraw their agreement to the facts stated therein in the SOAF. This application of the Defence was not allowed.

25     Whilst this meant that the Defence had admitted that the subject 31 payments had been made by NYZ to the Accused, NYZ was uncertain about some of these payments. There were some cash payments for which she could not recount the surrounding circumstances. In her oral testimony, NYZ simply stuck to the narrative that the Accused had deceived her into believing that he was investing in a shophouse and that she could be a shareholder thereof. In the final analysis, there was some doubt, even if NYZ’s assertions that the Accused had deceptively led her to believe in the shophouse investment were true, whether all 31 payments were for the furtherance of this “investment”.

26     Another point of uncertainty related to what the individual payments were meant to be. There appeared to be some purported payments as capital contribution and some payments that were supposedly made towards the engagement of a lawyer to formalise the alleged agreed arrangement between the Accused and NYZ for the acquisition of the alleged shophouse.

27     Whilst it can be argued that capital payments towards the alleged investment in the shophouse and payments for the hiring of a lawyer were to achieve the same ends, the fact that NYZ could not clearly articulate which payments were for which purpose was indicative of a further deficiency in the Prosecution’s case.

28     We should commence our analysis of the cogency of the Prosecution’s case by a careful perusal of the Police Report made by NYZ, which was treated as the First Information Report (“FIR”) in this case. The FIR can be found as P1-1 to P1-2. The FIR, as part of the Prosecution’s case, will be carefully studied to show the material inconsistencies in the overall case for the Prosecution. It has to be appreciated that the FIR was only made on 27 August 2013, more than 7 months after the final payment in January 2013.

29     NYZ lodged this FIR at a Police Station on 27 August 2013 (more than 7 months after the final payment {5 January 2013} purportedly related to the alleged cheating). NYZ indicated at trial that she was not entirely clear with all the details set out in the FIR, at the time of the making of the FIR.

30     Where indicated, some of NYZ’s assertions in the FIR are paraphrased, and some are quoted _verbatim_. NYZ started reciting in the FIR that sometime in July 2012, the Accused “approached” her “to discuss about making an investment with him however I (NYZ) declined.”

31     NYZ then stated that “On 20 Sept 2013, he (the Accused) came to find me at my house and offered to send me to my workplace. During the journey, he brought up about him setting up a new spa business and asked if I want to join in to buy over the shophouse itself from the previous owner, and that I could earn a profit as part of a shareholder when I help to work at the shop when it opened.”

32     From the outset, it could be seen that the stated date, “20 Sept 2013” could not be correct, as that date post-dated the date of the FIR. During the trial, NYZ could not clearly state what this date ought to be. It could be taken that the year was the erroneous entry, and it should have been “20 Sept 2012”. NYZ could not confirm whether the month “Sept” itself was an error and that the alleged misrepresentation had been made earlier than September 2012. This is crucial. For present purposes we shall consider that the date meant to have been entered was “20 Sept 2012” – this is a reasonable assumption considering what NYZ stated later on in the FIR.

33     NYZ then states “On that day itself” – and we would have to consider this to be the assumptive date of “20 Sept 2012”.

34     NYZ stated, “On that day itself, I went to the POSB bank and DBS bank to make the transfer to his account, SGD $2000.00/- each. NYZ then narrates how the Accused repeated this method of extracting monies from her. NYZ stated that the Accused “told me I had to transfer to him to make the buying-over work, if not I will not be able to get back all the amount that I had invested.” The suggestion here is that NYZ made two payments of $2,000 each (one from POSB bank and one from DBS bank) to the Accused. However, the Annex to the Charge lists only one payment of $2,000 on 20 September 2012.

35     What NYZ states next in the FIR is very telling. NYZ states various estimated amounts that she had transferred to the Accused over a span of time. As a starting point, NYZ states estimated sums for the months of September, October and November 2012, and January 2013.

36     The point to be made here is that, quite clearly, alleged payments to the Accused pursuant to the alleged misrepresentation about the shophouse, commenced, (in the mind of NYZ) from 20 September 2012 onwards. It could not have commenced earlier than 20 September 2012 as “20 September” was the date these payments (for the shophouse) began, as alleged in the FIR. NYZ also made it a point to start accounting for payments to the Accused from September 2012 onwards, and not earlier.

37     It must be borne in mind that making the FIR as she did (on 27 August 2013, a date much nearer the date of the asserted payments as compared to her testimony in Court) meant that what is stated in the FIR would arguably have more probative value than her evidence in Court, given more than 7 years after the events.

38     When one looks at the Annex to the Charge, one sees that the first 8 entries are for dates that precede 20 September 2012. The total for these 8 entries comes up to the sum of $21,500, which is a significant portion (almost 27.6%) of the total sum of $77,980 said to have been paid to the Accused for the purpose of the shophouse. The Accused had characterised payments made to him as “loans” from NYZ. Where, as can be shown here, payments had been made to the Accused before the alleged misrepresentation regarding the shophouse had been made (on 20 September 2012), one possible conclusion that may be made is that NYZ had made payments to the Accused for reasons other than for a purported shophouse investment.

39     It has to be borne in mind that the Defence is not required to ordinarily prove its defence. In cases such as the present, the Prosecution has the burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt. It would not be appropriate to just discount the first 8 items in the Annex to the Charge and amend the Charge to just refer to items numbered 9 through to 31.

40     There was doubt as to whether the sum total of the items numbered 9 to 31 were indeed in respect of payments for an alleged shophouse investment. In the FIR, the sums that NYZ stated were paid to the Accused for the individual months of September, October and November 2012 and January 2013, were all less than the respective monthly totals as set out in the Annex to the Charge. This was yet another deficiency to the Prosecution’s case. Again, there is a strong suggestion that payments to the Accused could have been for a myriad of reasons (other than for an alleged shophouse investment).

41     In the FIR, the total sums paid to the Accused for the months of September to November 2012 and January 2013, amounted to $53,700. To this, NYZ adds that she had also made bank transfers “until the month of May 2013” and based on the transaction slips she had, “the amount is about SGD $31,680.00/-.” NYZ goes on to conclude that “These amounted to about SGD $85,380.00/-“ (which is the total sum of the said $53,700 and $31,680). Now, considering that this sum of $85,380 exceeds either the sum of $77,980 (the sum stated in the Charge) or the lesser sum of ($77,980 minus the sums stated in the first 8 entries of the Annex to the Charge) strongly suggests that there had been other payments made to the Accused for other purposes. There is a further twist in the tale.

42     After coming to the total of $85,380 (see \[41\] above), NYZ states in the FIR, “However, there are amount of about over S$100,000 which I had also transferred to him and the amount can be shown via my bank statement.” It is unclear whether NYZ was saying that the total sum paid over to the Accused for the alleged shophouse investment was more than the stated $85,380, and approximated to a sum of “about over S$100,000”, or whether she was alleging that she had paid the Accused a total sum in excess of $185,380. The latter interpretation ($185,380) is supported by her use of the words “ … over S$100,000 which I had also transferred to him …” with the emphasis on the word “also”.

43     It is therefore unclear whether NYZ was saying that she had paid over to the Accused a total sum of (“over”) $100,000 or $185,380. It has to be borne in mind that the primary purpose for the FIR was to report an alleged total sum that had been allegedly paid by NYZ to the Accused. The alternative sums of $100,000 or $185,380 are far in excess of the $77,980 stated in the Charge. Further, it has to be noted that in the FIR, NYZ stated that she was making payments “until the month of May 2013” and that she “did not make any more transfer since May 2013”. This is contrasted with the time frame stated in the Charge which ends in early January 2013.

44     Whilst it is within the Prosecution’s prerogative to not charge an accused to the full extent of his alleged criminality, the exercise above does demonstrate that NYZ’s assertions against the Accused had to be carefully studied to come to a conclusion as to how much of her evidence could be considered valid and cogent. The conclusion to be reached is that the evidence of NYZ had to be treated with a degree of doubt.

45     One aspect of this reluctance to fully accept the evidence of NYZ was her omission to state in the FIR that the Accused had himself made at least 5 payments to her, totalling $4,500. One reason for making the FIR was possibly to inform the Police of potential criminal wrongdoing on the part of the Accused. It would however be the more likely reason that NYZ was documenting the total sums she claimed to be due to her as a result of the “failed” or “false” investment for the shophouse. The omission of the $4,500 total made to her by the Accused (as a possible set off, perhaps) calls into question the reliability of the assertions contained in the FIR.

46     It was also inexplicable that NYZ who had some experience in business, should, without question continue paying the Accused, almost akin to flowing water from a tap, when it was alleged that the Accused never once made very clear what the investment exactly entailed. The fact that the indicative price (and other important details) had not been revealed gave rise to doubts about the story spun by NYZ. Giving evidence, NYZ gave the impression that she was not ignorant of the ways of the business world or the activities surrounding investments.

47     At trial, the Prosecution’s position was that NYZ was given to understand that her share would have been 30%. In the Statement given by the Accused to the Police on 22 July 2014 (admitted as P2), the Accused was asked at Question 9: “Mdm (NYZ) claimed that you told her that you will be opening a spa and she would have 25 percent share in the business after she handed you all those money.” This was yet another doubt in the Prosecution’s case. Was the intended share to be 25% or 30%? Was the investment meant to be in the property (the shophouse) or the business?

48     In the earlier iteration of the charges, the allegation had been to NYZ investing as a “shareholder” in the spa business to be set up by the Accused. In the Charge, the allegation was amended to refer to her investing as a shareholder in the shophouse the Accused allegedly intended to buy. In either version, there was grave doubt as to whether all the 31 (admitted) payments were for the purpose of this alleged investment (in either a shophouse or a spa business), or for other purposes such as “loans” (whether they be for intended returns or outright “friendly loans”). The evidence is simply quite unclear on all these fronts.

49     There is also the possibility that NYZ may have inflated the total sums she claimed had been paid to the Accused and which she claimed were due to her from the Accused.

50     All considered, this was not a case where it could be stated with any confidence, that NYZ had been an “unusually convincing” witness. The evidence from the FIR and from the testimony of NYZ in Court left much to be desired and could not lead to the conclusion that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

51     A trial has to be decided on the evidence presented. In this case, the documentary evidence itself (mainly encapsulated in the FIR) was made more than 7 months after the final payment in January 2013. NYZ’s evidence suggested that the FIR itself may have not been entirely accurate. The oral evidence from NYZ was received more than 7 years after the relevant events. A perusal of the transcript of the oral testimony of NYZ at trial shows many instances where NYZ candidly admits she could not remember several events. This was not unexpected, given the long time lapse.

52     It would have been unsafe to sever any of the portions of the stated payments (in particular the first 8 entries in the Annex to the Charge) and amend the Charge accordingly. The evidence as a whole led to great doubt whether each and every one of the 31 stated entries related to an alleged investment. There was a strong possibility that some of the payments may have been for other purposes. The difficulty would be that it would not have been clear which payments were for which purpose. In this regard, it was not for the Defence to prove the point that at least some of the payments were for other purposes, other than for an alleged investment. The Defence was only required to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution had the burden to prove that each and every of the 31 payments were for the very purpose of advancing NYZ’s alleged investment. It would, as stated earlier, have been unsafe to convict the Accused on the Charge based on the evidence presented. The Accused was acquitted accordingly.
