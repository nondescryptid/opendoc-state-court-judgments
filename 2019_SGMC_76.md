### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused is a male Singapore citizen aged 53 years old. At the material time, the accused was working as a transporter operator in the employment of SATS Limited.

## BACKGROUND

2       The accused had pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 338(_b_) of the Penal Code. He had failed to keep a proper lookout while he was reversing a transporter vehicle and had collided into the victim. As a result of the accused’s negligent act, the victim had sustained a serious skull fracture that necessitated surgery and which had also resulted in a permanent disfiguration of his head.

## THE PROCEEDED CHARGE

3       The accused pleaded guilty to the proceeded charge as set out below -

> _MAC-906380-2018_

> _You_,

> _are charged that you, on the 29th day of January 2018, at about 8.40am, at the tarmac apron area E11 of Changi Airport Terminal 2, Singapore, did cause grievous hurt to one Teo Yen Hiap, a staff of Razor Solutions Pte Ltd, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger human life, to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout while reversing a transporter vehicle bearing number TLD 243 and knocking into the said Teo Yen Hiap, causing the said Teo Yen Hiap to suffer an acute subdural haemorrhage on his right fronto parietal region, a fracture of his right temporal bone and bifrontal contusions, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

4       The statement of facts which the accused had admitted without qualification is set out below –

**ROSLI BIN ISMAIL**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

> 1.    The accused is one Rosli Bin Ismail, male, Malay, aged 53 years old, bearing NRIC No.: SXXXX, a Singapore Citizen. At the material time, the accused was working as a transporter operator under the employment of SATS Limited.

> 2.    The victim is one Teo Yen Hiap, male, aged 63 years old. At the material time, the victim was working as an apron assistant under the employment of Razor Solutions Private Limited, which is the sub-contractor of SATS Limited. As an apron assistant, the victim was responsible for loading and unloading cargo and luggage from aircrafts.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE (MAC-906380-2018)**

> 3.    On 29 January 2018, the victim and the accused were on duty at the tarmac apron area E11 of Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 2, for a Singapore Airlines flight SQ178 to Ho Chi Minh City.

> 4.    The accused is a ramp service man and his duty is to drive a transporter vehicle, bearing number TLD 243 (“**Transporter**”) (_see Figures 1 and 2 below_). The height, length and width of the Transporter are 1.85 metres, 4.85 metres and 3.82 metres respectively. The empty weight of the Transporter is 5,100 kilograms. As the Transporter was not equipped with any front, back or side mirror, the accused was trained and knew that he had to look out for traffic manually when operating the Transporter to make sure that no person was in his way when driving the Transporter.

> 5.    On 29 January 2018 at about 8.40am, the victim and the accused were tasked to load cargo at two points: points A and C (_see Figure 3 below_). The victim assisted the accused to load two bulk hold containers onto the Transporter at point A (_see Figure 3 below_). Thereafter, the accused drove the Transporter to the rear cargo bulk hold of the aircraft at point B to unload the two bulk hold containers (_see Figure 3 below_).

![]([2019] SGMC 0076_Image/[2019] SGMC 0076_image3.png)

> 6.    After the accused had transferred the two bulk hold containers to another conveyor vehicle at point B, the accused then prepared to drive the Transporter to point A. Likewise, the victim also proceeded to point C (_see Figure 3 below_) to carry on with more loading at point C. The accused turned his head to the left fully to check his left blind spot. He then turned his head to the right. However, the accused did not turn his head fully to the right as he was suffering from a neck strain; instead, the accused assumed that there was no one behind the Transporter. As a result, the accused did not see the victim who was walking from point A to point C to load more cargo, and who happened to be in the accused’s right blind spot behind the Transporter. Thereafter, the accused did an act so negligently as to endanger human life by failing to keep a proper lookout while engaging the reverse gear, tapping the accelerator and reversing into the victim. The victim was knocked down.

> 7.    According to the medical report dated 26 March 2018, the victim suffered an acute subdural haemorrhage on his right fronto perietal region, a fracture of his right temporal bone and bifrontal contusions (_see Figure 4 below_). He underwent decompressive craniectomy followed by intensive care stay and in-patient rehabilitation. The victim was admitted into Changi General Hospital on 29 January 2018 and discharged on 14 February 2018, with medical leave extending to 19 March 2018.

![]([2019] SGMC 0076_Image/[2019] SGMC 0076_image4.png)

> 8.    According to the medical report dated 12 September 2018, as a result of the aforementioned injuries, the victim is at risk of suffering from meningitis, meningocele or encephalocele in the middle ear due to the disrupted tegmen tympani.

> 9    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused person caused the victim grievous hurt by doing an act so negligently as to endanger human life, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## THE OFFFENCE

5       The offence of causing grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life or the personal safety of others, shall be punished under s. 338 (b) of the Penal Code in the case of a _negligent_ act, with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both. In addition, upon a conviction of this offence, a disqualification order from holding or obtaining a driving licence may also be imposed under section 42 of the Road Traffic Act.

## ANTECEDENTS

6       The accused has a dated antecedent for driving without due care and consideration back in 1985.

## SUBMISSIONS BY PROSECUTION

7       It was submitted by the Prosecution that it is well established that offences which affect public health and safety warrant the application of general deterrence (_PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span>[^1] (_Law Aik Meng_) at \[24(d)\]). It was submitted that this would also extend to the proper usage of vehicles as indicated by the following cases:

> i.     Drink driving (_Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 755</span>[^2] (“_Stansilas_”) at \[100\]);

> ii.     Dangerous driving (_PP v Aw Tai Hock_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 1141</span>[^3] at \[21\]); and

> iii.     Driving whilst using a mobile phone (_Tan Kian Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 131</span>[^4] at \[21\]).

8       It was submitted that the accused’s act of negligently causing grievous hurt through improper vehicle usage therefore fell within the principle of offences affecting public health and safety. His actions on the day of the incident involving the driving of a transporter vehicle was similar to the examples involving improper vehicle usage as listed above. It was also submitted that in the present case, there was a clear need to deter vehicle users from failing to keep a proper lookout in a work place area.

9       The Prosecution further submitted that the sentencing framework in the case of _Tang Ling Lee v PP <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span>_ would provide useful guidance in calibrating the appropriate sentence.

10     The Prosecution accordingly submitted for a sentence of 2 weeks imprisonment to be imposed on the accused.

## MITIGATION

11     Counsel had submitted for a fine of $5000 to be imposed on the accused as his culpability was low. He also had a good record at work with his employer. It was also submitted that the victim who was not supposed to be at the place where the collision took place, had walked into the path of the Transporter vehicle. This had significantly increased the likelihood of a collision.

## DECISION OF THE COURT

#### The proper sentencing approach

12     I am mindful that the Prosecution had relied on the sentencing framework laid out in _Tang Ling Lee v PP <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span>._ In that case, the offender had pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act which endangered human life, an offence under s 338(b) of the Penal Code. The offender was making a right turn while driving her vehicle along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 towards Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, when she collided with the victim, a motorcyclist, who was riding straight along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8. The victim had the right of way. The offender did not keep a proper lookout. She also had made no effort to check for oncoming vehicles before executing the right turn. She also did not stop at the right turning pocket to look out for oncoming traffic. The victim had suffered serious injuries, including multiple fractures, and had to undergo 12 surgeries within two months. The victim was also hospitalised for 69 days in all at Tan Tock Seng Hospital after the accident. Upon his discharge, he was given 180 days’ hospitalisation leave.

13     The offender Tang was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment and was also disqualified from driving or obtaining a license to drive all classes of vehicles for two years with effect from the date of conviction. She brought an appeal against the sentence of one week’s imprisonment. The High Court dismissed the appeal.

14     Regarding the sentencing framework established in the case, I note that See J had expressly stated that the sentencing framework should apply only to _road traffic cases_ involving s. 338 (b) of the Penal Code -see paragraph 27 of _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ –

> _“24_.     **_Due to the potentially wide variety of circumstances which may disclose an offence under s 338(b) of the Penal Code, I emphasise that the suggested sentencing framework set out in this judgment is intended to apply only to road traffic cases._** **_It is not intended to cover cases of grievous hurt arising from negligent acts in other contexts_** _. For instance, s 338(b) may be used to deal with cases involving “killer litter”, and the starting point in sentencing for such cases where grievous hurt is caused by negligence ought to be a substantial custodial term given the degree of culpability and harm occasioned._

> (Emphasis added)

15     In this regard and by way of background, at an earlier sentencing mention on 10 July 2019, the Prosecution had informed the court that it would be relying on the sentencing framework for s. 338 (b) Penal Code offences established by the High Court in the case of _Tang Ling Lee v PP_. I had then pointed out to the Prosecution that the incident actually took place at the tarmac apron area E11 of Changi Airport Terminal 2 and not a public road. The Prosecution later confirmed that the incident location was a workplace under s. 5 (1) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A Statutes of Singapore). To be fair, the Prosecution had readily acknowledged that the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework only applied to road traffic cases. In this regard, at the further hearing on 10 July 2019, Counsel had clarified that the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework had been referred to in the High Court appeal case of _Cai Mei Ying v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 24</span>_ where he had appeared as defence counsel. Although the appeal against sentence by the appellant had been dismissed, Counsel stated that Aedit Abdullah J did not appear to expressly endorse the Tang Ling Lee sentencing framework. In any case, I note that Counsel in his written submissions had submitted that the accused would fall within Category 1 or alternatively Category 2 of the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework.[^5] Neither did Counsel appear to submit that the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework would _not_ be appropriate for a collision at a workplace area within the meaning of the Workplace Safety and Health Act.[^6] However, at the sentencing mention on 23 October 2019, Counsel _changed_ his position and stated that the defence now took the position that the Tang Ling Lee framework _did not_ apply to the present case. [^7]

16     At the same time, the Prosecution had also conceded that there is no directly applicable sentencing framework for such a workplace accident scenario involving s. 338 (b) of the Penal Code.[^8] As such, it was now apparent that both Parties were not on the same page and took different views on whether the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework should apply to the facts of the present case.

17     For the avoidance of doubt, I agreed in principle with the Prosecution that the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework could be useful to the court. In particular, I was of the view that the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework with its emphasis on harm caused and culpability of the accused, would provide valuable guidance to this court in calibrating the appropriate sentencing band and range and the starting points for the appropriate sentence to be imposed.

18     I also note that in the recent High Court appeal case of _Cai Mei Ying v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 24</span>_, Abdullah J had accepted and followed the 3 band categorization set out by See J as regards culpability and harm. In the _Cai Mei Ying v PP_ case, the offender was cycling in a market compound where cycling was not permitted. This was also a non-road traffic case as the present case before this court. The offender had also been charged for causing grievous hurt by doing an act so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of others. His sentence of one week’s imprisonment was upheld by the High Court and the appeal against sentence was dismissed.

19     In view of the above, I therefore applied the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework, taking care to note the surrounding facts of this case, in particular that the incident had occurred at a workplace location.

#### The Tang Ling Lee Sentencing Framework

20     In arriving at the sentencing framework, See J stated that 3 broad sentencing bands, within which the severity of an offence and hence the appropriate sentence to be imposed may be determined on the basis of (a) the _harm_ caused by the offence and (b) the _culpability_ of the offender. See J also emphasised that in the context of s. 338(_b_) Penal Code offences, the degree of harm caused would generally refer to the nature and degree of the grievous bodily injury caused to the victim. See J stated at paragraph \[25\] that “T_he degree of culpability would generally refer to the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions, and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act (ie, the manner of driving).”_

21     Bearing the above considerations in mind, See J stated that the following presumptive sentencing ranges apply where the accused _claims trial_ -

> “

22     See J went on to describe the 3 categories in the following terms –

> _“_      _Category 1_

>> _34_      _Category 1, which prescribes fines as the presumptive sentence, would cover cases where both the harm and the accused’s culpability_ _are at the lower end of the spectrum. In these instances, culpability-increasing factors would either be absent altogether or present only to a very limited extent, thus suggesting negligence to be at the lowest end of the spectrum. The harm occasioned to the victim(s) would generally be characterised by the lack of very serious or permanent injuries. This is often reflected in the victim having undergone a relatively brief duration of hospitalisation and medical leave (or none at all) and minimal surgical procedures (if any)._

> _Category 2_

>> _35_      _Category 2 comprises offences of a higher level of seriousness._ _These are usually cases where (a) the harm is at the lower end of the spectrum but the culpability of the offender is moderate to high; or (b) the harm is serious but the culpability of the offender remains low. The presumptive sentencing range for cases falling under this category is one to two weeks’ imprisonment. Where there are two or more culpability-increasing factors or injuries of a more serious or permanent nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures, the offence would generally fall into Category 2._

> _Category 3_

>> _36_      _Category 3 would cover the most serious road traffic cases that give rise to offences under s 338(b) of the Penal Code,_ _where there are both serious injuries and a moderate to high degree of culpability. A case falling within the Category 3 sentencing band would usually feature at least two culpability-increasing factors and injuries of a very serious or permanent nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures. In this connection, serious long-term injuries occasioned to the victim, such as loss of limb, sight or hearing or paralysis in particular, would generally attract the sentencing band in Category 3.”_

23     At this stage, it would be apposite to set out the 2-step sentencing framework as articulated by See J in _Tang Ling Lee v PP - ._

> _“32_      _In sentencing an offender for a road traffic case under s 338(b) of the Penal Code, therefore_, **_the court should undertake a two-step inquiry:_**

>> (_a_)     _First, the court should identify the sentencing band within which the offence in question falls, and also where the particular case falls within the applicable presumptive sentencing range, having regard to the twin considerations of harm and culpability, in order to derive the starting point sentence._

>> (_b_)     _Second, further adjustments should then be made to take into account the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, which may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable presumptive sentencing range._

#### Position of the Parties

24     The Prosecution took the view that the culpability of the accused was high and the harm caused by his negligent act to be serious. It was submitted that the accused’s case therefore fell within Category 3.

25     The Defence took a different position. While accepting that the harm caused was serious, it took the view that the culpability of the accused was low. The Defence took the view that the accused’s case therefore fell within Category 1. Alternatively, it was submitted that the accused’s case was a Category 2 case where 1 to 2 weeks imprisonment should be imposed. Counsel also submitted that the victim was not supposed to be at the place where he was knocked down. In view of the victim’s contributory negligence, the sentence should also be reduced further. In view of all the mitigating circumstances of the case, the accused would fall back into Category 1 and therefore a fine of the maximum $5000 should be imposed.

#### Reasons for Sentence

#### Culpability of accused

26     I first considered the culpability of the accused.

#### (i)   The accused’s blameworthiness and act of omission

27     The SOF indicated the sequence of events leading up to the unfortunate incident where the victim was knocked down by the Transporter that the accused was driving.

28     After the accused had transferred the two bulk hold containers to another conveyor vehicle at point B, the accused then prepared to drive the Transporter to point A. Likewise, the victim also proceeded to point C (_see Figure 3 below_) to carry on with more loading at point C. Here, I pause to observe that the accused had turned his head to the left _fully_ to check his left blind spot. He then turned his head to the right. This time his safety check for the right side blind spot was limited. This was because the accused did not turn his head fully to the right as he was suffering from a neck strain. What the accused did instead was that he had had _assumed_ that there was no one behind the Transporter. This was certainly a lapse on the part of the accused. What followed next was that as a result, the accused did not see the victim who was walking from point A to point C to load more cargo. This walking pattern of the victim took him into the accused’s right blind spot behind the Transporter. At the same time, as I noted earlier, the accused had assumed that there was no one behind the Transporter. While there was no corroborative CCTV footage admitted into evidence, I proceeded to evaluate the culpability of the accused on the basis of the facts as admitted without qualification by the accused in the SOF. I was mindful in particular, that such preceding facts are important to scrutinize and bear in mind as collision cases are invariably highly fact-sensitive.

29     While it is unfortunate that the accused was suffering from a neck sprain at that critical moment, in my judgment, it was open to him to shift and turn his body around as an alternative safety check so that he could also cover and see his right blind spot. He did not do so. His reasons for not doing so were not stated in mitigation. Indeed, during oral submissions, Counsel had candidly acknowledged that the accused should not even have assumed that there was no one behind the Transporter.[^9] To go further and attempt to rely on a neck sprain would _a fortio_ri, have been an invalid and unreasonable excuse. As such, in my judgment the culpability of the accused would have to be properly evaluated on the basis of the accused’s decision to first, assume no one was behind the Transporter and second, his failure to change his body position and to turn around fully to check his right blind spot.

#### (ii)   The accused was in charge of a dangerous vehicle

30     I note further from the admitted SOF, that the Transporter was not equipped with any front, back or side mirror. It is significant also that the accused was _trained_ and knew that he had to look out for traffic manually when operating the Transporter to make sure that no person was in his way when driving the Transporter. As the accused had been so trained in view of the lack of mirrors on the Transporter to look out for traffic, it was inexplicable that he did not keep a proper look out. Furthermore, if he had been trained to look out for vehicular traffic behind him, it would also follow that he would need to keep a look out for co-workers behind the Transporter as he was in a work place and not on a lonely road devoid of vehicular or human traffic, including walking co-workers. The inevitable inference in my view is that the accused did not keep a proper look out. It would appear that the accused had probably been distracted or he had suffered from a lapse in judgment. It is more likely that the accused had been distracted by the pain from his neck strain. This would probably also account for why he did not swivel or turn his body around to check his right blind spot. His actions were therefore blameworthy and negligent in these circumstances.

#### (iii)   Location and nature of the incident

31     At this juncture, it is necessary to keep in perspective two vital considerations – first, the knocking into the victim by the Transporter driven by the accused occurred at the tarmac apron area E1 – a _work place_ for the accused. Secondly, the Transporter itself was not a small vehicle – its dimensions were at a height, length and width of 1.85 metres, 4.85 metres and 3.82 metres respectively. The empty weight of the Transporter was a massive 5,100 kilogrammes. It is abundantly clear that these two considerations alone had necessitated his Employer providing the accused with safety training that required the accused to take safety precautions when driving the Transporter at his work place. In other words, in view of the absence of mirrors on the Transporter, the accused knew that he had to look out for traffic manually when operating the Transporter so as to make sure that no person was in his way when driving the Transporter.

32     I pause here to note that during his oral sentencing submissions, Counsel had argued that because the incident took place at a work place, the accused could _not_ be said to have been involved in any risk-taking behaviour.[^10] In this regard, Counsel had also referred to the District Court case of _PP v Zhang Xiong Guo <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 18</span>_. Counsel referred particularly to paragraph 31 of the judgment where the District Judge had stated that “ _To make matters worse, unlike workers at a worksite who may have some familiarity working with vehicles like the forklift, and thus may have been more alert to the dangers that such vehicles could pose, members of the public like bus drivers and bus passengers would not be similarly aware or prepared.”_ With respect, I found this to be a strained argument by Counsel. When pressed further by the court, Counsel did acknowledge that the location of the incident being a workplace, was a relevant factor in assessing the culpability of the accused. Counsel further accepted that although the present case was not a road traffic case, insofar as assessing harm and culpability was concerned, the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework was nonetheless still a useful guide for the court. Counsel also acknowledged that this had been accepted as such in the _Cai Mei Ying_ decision of the High Court. [^11]

#### The issue of causation

33     For completeness, I should also deal with the further submission of Counsel that there was contributory negligence by the victim as he had walked into an area that he was not supposed to be at. In essence, Counsel was seeking to apply the decision of the High Court in _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span> (“_Nickson Guay_”).

34     In _Nickson Guay_, the High Court noted as follows at paragraph \[70\] -

> 70.     _Where the_ _conduct of the victim_ or third parties, _whether negligent or otherwise, has_ **_materially contributed_** _to the outcome for which the offender is being charged, but_ **_has no bearing on the culpability of the offender_**, **_it should not affect_** _the sentence to be imposed.”_

35     The Prosecution submitted that Counsel’s argument that the accused’s culpability is lowered because the victim himself “_significantly increased the likelihood of an incident_” was unsupported _by Nickson Guay_. It was submitted that in paragraph 5(d) of Counsel’s 10 July 2019 Mitigation Plea, Counsel had relied upon the English authority of R v Smith, cited at \[50\] – \[51\] of Nickson Guay. However, the Prosecution submitted that the position in the UK is different from that in Singapore – the UK Sentencing Guidelines expressly state that contributory negligence should be taken into account as a mitigating factor – see \[48\] of Nickson Guay. It was further submitted that in contrast, the position in Singapore as set out at paragraph \[70\] of _Nickson Guay_, requires that the contributory negligence must have a bearing on the accused’s culpability. The Prosecution also submitted that by its very nature, all contributory negligence will necessarily increase the likelihood of an incident and that this does not automatically lower the culpability of an offender[^12].

36     I agreed with the above submissions of the Prosecution. With respect, I am of the view that a careful reading of _Nickson Guay_ will reveal that it does not stand for the proposition that Counsel seeks to advance.

37     First, the accused’s allegation that “no one should be standing near the rear of the transporter” as stated at paragraph 9 (a) of the 30 July Mitigation Plea, clearly has no bearing on the _culpability_ of the accused. This must be so both as a matter of logic and from a point of principle. As a matter of logic, when considering the blameworthiness of an offender, it would be illogical for an offender to cast the blame upon the victim by stating that he should not have been standing where he was. This is almost tantamount to asserting that the victim should not have come to work that morning and then there would have been no collision. Further as a matter of principle, if the accused in a workplace environment, was entitled to rely upon this casual and deflective assertion, then the need for a worker to check a blind spot would be rendered otiose, since it can be safely assumed that no person would ever be nearby. Indeed, this flies in the face of both logic and work place safety principles, when one considers that the accused had been given training to always keep a proper look out, bearing in mind that the Transporter had no safety mirrors to rely upon to check the surroundings. Relying on _Nickson Guay_, the conduct of the victim clearly did not _materially__contribute_ to the accident. Further, it is more than apparent that the conduct of the victim also had no bearing on the overall culpability of the accused. The accused was _trained_ and knew that he had to look out for traffic when operating the Transporter to make sure that no person was in his way when driving the Transporter. Further, in view of the lack of mirrors on the Transporter, the accused had been trained to also look out for traffic. He did not keep a proper look out. He also had assumed, in violation of his training protocol and requirements, that there was no one in his right blind spot area. The accused was clearly negligent in these circumstances.

38     In my judgment, any negligence of the victim in walking from point A to C as in Figure 3 of the SOF, did not affect the accused’s own culpability in not keeping a proper look out while reversing, in not turning his head and body around to check his right blind spot and in assuming that there was no one behind the Transporter. As succinctly stated by See J in _PP v Ong Heng Chua <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 388</span>_ at paragraph 33 - “_This is not to say that the victim did not contribute at all to the collision_, **_but rather that her negligence_****_did nothing to affect the offender’s culpability._****”** As such, I rejected Counsel’s argument that _Nickson Guay_ applied to the facts of this case and that the sentence to be imposed on the accused should thereby be reduced in view of the contributory negligence of the victim.

#### The Workplace Safety and Health Act

39     A further submission by Counsel in the accused’s mitigation plea dated 30 July 2019 (“30 July Mitigation Plea”) was that the court should take guidance from the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WSHA”).

40     The Prosecution however submitted that the sentencing framework under s 15(3A) of the WSHA did not provide good guidance in determining the appropriate sentence. It was submitted that the offence under s 15(3A) of the WSHA covered a much broader spectrum of harm caused to the victim ranging from potential harm (with no harm actually caused) to death (_Nurun Novi Saydur Rahman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 413</span> (“_Nurun Novi_”) at paragraphs \[79\] and \[84\]. It was submitted that in contrast, the Penal Code provided for a differentiated sentencing regime based on the degree of harm caused, with the offence under s 338(b) _limited to grievous hurt_ caused to the victim. It was submitted that the analysis of the degree of harm under the WSHA framework was therefore not applicable to the analysis of harm caused under s 338(b) of the Penal Code.

41     I agreed with the above submissions of the Prosecution.

42     Further, in relation to the issue of culpability, I note that the High Court in _Nurun Novi_ had observed at paragraph \[87\]) that “_an inquiry into an offender’s culpability will involve a__holistic assessment of all the circumstances,__having particular regard to the nature and circumstances surrounding the unsafe act”._ The High Court had also stated that the 3 factors listed at paragraph \[87\]) were “not meant to be exhaustive”. In my view, the _Nurun Novi_ framework was merely re-affirming the consideration of all relevant factors in determining the culpability of the accused and the appropriate sentence to be imposed. To this extent therefore, the _Nurun Novi_ framework could sit comfortably with the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework when determining the culpability of the offender.

43     Both Prosecution and Defence Counsel had also referred to the case of _PP v Mohd Hisham bin Mohamed Tahir_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 63</span> (“_Mohd Hisham_”). I note that Counsel had sought to distinguish _Mohd Hisham_ based on its own facts_._ I should state however, that I found this case to be a useful precedent, even though it was a District Court case.

44     In _Mohd Hisham_, the offender had _negligently_ failed to keep a proper look-out when reversing his prime mover within a trailer compound. The offender had conducted a single check of the compound, but _failed to turn his head_ to check the rear of the prime mover prior to reversing. The offender simply _assumed_ that the driveway would be clear of pedestrians based on his prior check. The prime mover collided with the victim, leading to his demise.

45     I noted that the District Judge had held that the offender’s culpability was high, and also stated that the offender’s failure to ensure that there were no pedestrians prior to reversing was a direct contravention of the Highway Code – see paragraphs \[19\] – \[20\]). It is significant that this finding was made although the offence in _Mohd Hisham_ occurred within a _workplace_ and not a public road. I further noted that that the offender’s employers also faced separate criminal charges for violating the WSHA arising from the same incident. In this regard, I recognize that the offence in _Mohd Hisham_ was one under s 304A(_b_) of the Penal Code, unlike in our case where the offence is one under s. 338 (b) of the Penal Code. Nonetheless, the District Judge’s assessment of culpability of the offender is consistent with the evaluation of the culpability of the present accused using the _Tang Ling Lee_ framework enunciated by the High Court.

#### Harm to the victim

46     There was not much dispute here as both parties agreed generally that the harm suffered by the victim was not insignificant, but serious. From the SOF itself, the victim suffered an acute subdural haemorrhage on his right fronto perietal region, a fracture of his right temporal bone and bifrontal contusions – as in Fig 4 of the SOF. He also underwent decompressive craniectomy followed by intensive care stay and in-patient rehabilitation. These are undoubtedly significant surgical procedures. The victim was admitted into Changi General Hospital on 29 January 2018 and discharged almost a month later on 14 February 2018. He was also given more than a month’s medical leave extending to 19 March 2018. According to the medical report dated 12 September 2018, as a result of the aforementioned injuries, the victim is now at risk of suffering from meningitis, meningocele or encephalocele in the middle ear due to the disrupted tegmen tympani. In a more recent medical report by Dr Pande Shrikant, a Senior Consultant at Changi General Hospital dated 28 August 2019, it was reported that the “_current shape of the head……. is likely to be permanent.”_ The Medical Report had also clarified that while the disfigurement of skull is largely corrected, the current shape of the head as a result of all these events is likely to be permanent.

47     In view of the above, the harm caused to the victim cannot be otherwise than serious.

#### Summary

48     In the light of my observations and findings above and also noting the accused’s own admission that he had _assumed_ that there was no one behind the Transporter, I was led inexorably to the conclusion that the accused was completely oblivious to the need to be careful and keep a proper look out while driving a dangerous vehicle at his work place. As such, I determined that his culpability as reflected in his manner of driving the Transporter in these circumstances should be assessed to be on the high side. As for the injuries suffered by the victim, I was of the view that the injuries were on the serious side.

49     As for mitigating factors, I noted that the accused had pleaded guilty to the charge and I accorded the usual sentencing discount given to a plea of guilt. While not entirely exceptional, I noted too that the accused had a good employment record

## CONCLUSION

50     Applying the _Tang Ling_ Lee sentencing framework, the indicative sentencing range would be _more than_ 2 weeks imprisonment for an offender who had _claimed trial_. The accused in this case had pleaded guilty to the charge and I gave him credit for his plea of guilt. I noted that the accused did turn his head to the left fully to check his left blind spot. He was also reversing slowly and within the speed limit laid down by his employers.

51     I have considered the surrounding facts of this case and also considered the mitigation submitted by Counsel. I have also found that the culpability of the accused was high and the harm caused was serious. I accordingly sentenced the accused to 2 weeks imprisonment. Upon being queried by the court as to the imposition of a disqualification order under s. 42 of the Road Traffic Act, the Prosecution stated that they were _not_ asking for a disqualification order. In the light of this submission and noting that Counsel had also submitted that no disqualification order be imposed, I considered all the surrounding circumstances and exercised my discretion not to impose a disqualification order.

52     The accused is presently on bail pending appeal. I have ordered a stay of execution on the sentence of 2 weeks imprisonment that I imposed upon the accused.
