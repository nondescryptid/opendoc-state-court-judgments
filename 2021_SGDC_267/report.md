CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AND SENTENCING – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: The appeal in MA 9264/2021/01 was withdrawn on 30 November 2021.\]

26 November 2021

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Accused against the sentences imposed by me in relation to two Moneylenders Act (“MLA”) charges of assisting unlicensed moneylenders (“UML”) in the carrying on of the business of moneylending (“the MLA charges”), one charge of criminal breach of trust (“the CBT charge”) and one charge of illegally overstaying (“the overstaying charge”) in Singapore for a period of 17 days. He had pleaded guilty to these four charges on 17 November 2021.

2       The prosecution was conducted by DPP Goh Yong Ngee. The Accused was in person.

## The charges

### DAC-911500-2021 (“the first MLA charge”)

3       On 14 June 2021, on or about 10.25 pm, the Accused had taken a photograph of the flat unit #XXX at Block 1D Cantonment Road as instructed by an UML named ‘Vincent’, in relation to a loan taken by the domestic maid working at the said flat. This was an offence under s 5(1) punishable under s 14(1)(b)(i) read with s 14(1A)(a) of the Moneylenders’ Act (Cap 188, Rev Ed 2010).

### DAC-911987-2021 (“the second MLA charge”)

4       Between April and May 2021, the Accused had carried out electronic bank transfers using his POSBank account number XXX, in order to facilitate the carrying on of a moneylending business by an UML named ‘Perry’. This was an offence under s 5(1) punishable under s 14(1)(b)(i) read with s 14(1A)(a) of the Moneylenders’ Act (Cap 188, Rev Ed 2010).

### DAC-919317-2021 (“the CBT charge”)

5       From 3 to 31 December 2020, the Accused had dishonestly misappropriated the proceeds of sale amounting to $3,994.20 which was entrusted to him in his capacity as a sales promoter with New Essential Pte Ltd. This was an offence under s 408 of the Penal Code, Cap 224.

### MAC-905409-2021 (‘the overstaying charge”)

6       Between 31 May and 16 June 2021 - a period of 17 days - the Accused had illegally overstayed in Singapore without reasonable cause after the expiry of his Special Pass on 30 May 2021. This was an offence under s 15(1) punishable under s 15(3)(a) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133, Rev Ed).

7       Seven other MLA charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## The Facts

### Facts relating to the second MLA charge

8       Sometime in February or March 2021, the Accused’s family in Malaysia had run into financial difficulties. The Accused then received a Whatsapp message offering a loan. Out of desperation, he accepted the offer of the loan, even though he knew that the loan was unlicensed. He replied to the message and spoke to an UML known as ‘Perry’. In exchange for the loan. Perry had requested for the Accused’s bank account and handphone numbers. The Accused furnished these numbers to Perry. Perry then transferred $750 to the accused as the loan. The interest payment was $250 a week.

9       About three weeks later, Perry offered another $750 loan on the same terms. The Accused did accept as he was afraid that he could not pay the interest in time. Perry then convinced the Accused to work for him for payments of $300 to $400, which could be used to offset the interest payment.

10     Between April and May 2021, the Accused assisted Perry to carry out electronic bank transfers to facilitate Perry’s moneylending business using the Accused’s POSBank account bearing account numbers XXX. Perry would inform the Accused whenever monies were deposited into the POSBank account. The accused would then withdraw the monies in cash via the automated teller machine (“ATM”). He would then deposit the cash into bank accounts as directed by Perry. In total, the accused had transferred about $94,000 in this manner.

11     Sometime in May 2021, Perry had told the Accused to close the POSBank account. On Perry’s instructions, the Accused then collected another POSBank card bearing account numbers XXX from an unknown person in Jurong. He then used this account to facilitate unlicensed moneylending transfers in the same manner as described above (at \[10\]). In total, he had transferred about $30,000 using this POSBank account.

### Facts relating to the first MLA charge

12     Subsequently, Perry had instructed the Accused to close the POSBank account. However, the Accused refused as he needed the bank account for his own use. On Perry’s instructions, the Accused met an unknown Chinese male in Jurong and collected a OCBC ATM card which was to be used to facilitate the UML business. Perry then gave the Accused the PIN number for the OCBC ATM card and asked the Accused to furnish him with the OCBC account numbers. The Accused deposited $20 into the OCBC account in order to obtain the deposit slip. He then furnished the account number which was stated in the deposit slip to Perry. But the Accused forgot to retrieve the ATM card from the machine.

13     When the Accused informed Perry about the loss of the ATM card, Perry told him that it had cost $1,500 to open the OCBC bank account and that there was $700 in the said account. Perry demanded that the Accused make good the loss, failing which his superior, “Vincent”, had threatened the Accused with harassment. To settle the issue, Vincent offered the Accused to “look for people” and he would receive $50 for each person that he located. The amounts would be set-off against the loss that he had caused to Vincent.

14     On 14 June 2021, acting on Vincent’s instructions, the Accused went to Block 1D Cantonment Road, #XXX (“the flat”). The domestic maid who worked at the flat had taken a loan from Vincent. The Accused knocked on the door. There was no answer. The Accused then made a video call to Vincent showing himself pressing the doorbell. Again, nobody answered. Vincent then told the Accused to mess up the shoe rack outside the flat and to set fire to the flat. The accused refused. Vincent then told the Accused to take a photograph of the flat capturing the unit number and hand sanitizer bottle which was placed outside. The accused did as he was instructed. He then sent the photograph to Vincent. The photograph could then be used subsequently to harass the flat occupants. After sending the photograph, the Accused left the scene.

15     The occupants of the flat had in fact been harassed previously and had moved out of the flat temporarily out of fear. Subsequently, they had received more photographs and videos which caused them to sell the flat.

### Facts relating to the CBT charge

16     Between 3 and 31 December 2020, the Accused was employed as a sales promoter at New Essential Pte Ltd (“the company”). He was responsible for promoting and selling household products at roadshows. The Accused was, in that capacity, entrusted with the proceeds of sale of the company’s products. He was required to collect the sales proceeds, record down the items sold and the price at which they were sold, and to deposit the sales proceeds into the company’s bank account.

17     Between 3 to 31 December 2020, the Accused had dishonestly misappropriated $3,994.20, which constituted the sales proceeds entrusted to him and which he was supposed to deposit into the company’s bank account. The Accused had used the money to pay for his daily expenses. He had made restitution of $1,361.04. The total loss suffered by the company was $2,633.16.

### Facts relating to the overstaying charge

18     The Accused was a Malaysian national working in Singapore under a work permit. After his work permit had expired, he was issued with a 7-day special pass which commenced on 25 May 2021. After the special pass had expired on 30 May 2021, the Accused had remained unlawfully in Singapore for a period of 17 days (from 31 May 2021 to 16 June 2021).

## Antecedents

19     The Accused was a first offender.

## Prescribed punishment

20     The prescribed punishment for the MLA offence was imprisonment not exceeding four years, and fine of not less than $30,000 and not more than $300,000 and shall also be liable to caning of not more than 12 strokes.

21     The prescribed punishment for the CBT offence was imprisonment not exceeding 15 years and shall also be liable to a fine.

22     The prescribed punishment for the overstaying offence was a fine not exceeding $4,000, or to imprisonment not exceeding six months, or to both.

## Prosecution’s sentencing submission

23     DPP Goh sought the following sentences –

> (a)     At least three months’ imprisonment and $30,000 fine for each of the MLA charge;

> (b)     At least three months’ imprisonment for the CBT charge; and

> (c)     An appropriate fine for the overstaying charge.

24     DPP Goh submitted that the imprisonment sentences in one of the two MLA charges and the CBT charge should run consecutively.

## Mitigation plea

25     The Accused pleaded for leniency.

## The sentence

### The MLA charges

26     The dominant sentencing objective in relation to the MLA charges was deterrence.

27     The starting point for cases where the offender was paid for his assistance in the UML activities ranged between two weeks’ and three months’ imprisonment and the mandatory fine of $30,000: see _Mohamad Fairuuz bin Saleh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 1145</span> at \[77 and \[78\]. Where the offender had performed the collection of ATM cards and cash on behalf of the UML, the starting point was at least one month’s imprisonment and $30,000 fine. Where the offender had performed banking transactions such as fund transfers and cash withdrawals on behalf of the UML, the starting point was at least three months’ imprisonment and $30,000 fine. The case precedents in relation to the latter factual scenario were set out below –

28     In the present case, the Accused had assisted both Perry and Vincent in their UML activities in the following ways –

> (a)     Carried out electronic bank transfers using the Accused’s own POSBank account. He withdrew monies deposited into the POSBank account in cash via the ATM. He then deposited the cash into other bank accounts as directed by the two UML. He had transferred a total of $94,000.

> (b)     Carried out electronic bank transfers in the same manner as described in (a) above, using another POSBank account. He had transferred a total of $30,000.

> (c)     Taken a photograph of the flat unit where the debtor stayed and then forwarded the same to Vincent. The photograph could be used subsequently by Vincent to harass the said debtor.

29     In addition, I noted the following aggravating factors, namely, the Accused was paid $300 to $400 to perform the banking transactions, and $50 for taking the photograph of the flat unit of the debtor. Although the MLA offences had spanned only a period of two months, the Accused had committed a total of eight such offences over this short period of time.

30     I noted that the Accused had pleaded guilty. In this regard, I noted that the case precedents set out in the table above (at \[27\]) involved plead guilty cases.

31     I therefore agreed with DPP Goh’s proposed sentence of three months’ imprisonment and $30,000 fine for the two MLA charges. There was no other aggravating or mitigating factors that warranted a deviation from the starting point. I therefore imposed the sentence of three months’ imprisonment and $30,000 fine for each of the two MLA charges.

### The CBT charge

32     Where CBT offences were concerned, the key sentencing consideration was deterrence: see _PP v Osi Maria Elenora Protacio_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 78</span>. Imprisonment was mandatory.

33     The starting point for CBT of an amount between $2,000 to $5000 was six weeks’ imprisonment and $5,000 fine. For example, in _PP v Yap Chee Khang_ (DAC-920327-2021)(unreported), the offender was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for misappropriating a sum of $4,200 in his capacity as employee of his company.

34     DPP Goh sought a sentence of three months’ imprisonment. He relied on the case of _PP v Selena Chiong Chin May_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 268</span> (“_Selena Chiong_”) in support. The offender in _Selena Chiong_ was found guilty on seven charges and was sentenced to five months’ imprisonment for each charge. However, DPP Goh acknowledged that the facts in _Selena Chiong_ were far more egregious. For that reason, he had factored in the downward adjustment that was necessary to account for the disparity in the degree of egregiousness between the two cases.

35     I agreed with DPP Goh that the factual circumstances in _Selena Chiong_ were far more egregious, and as such a downward adjustment was necessary. The offender in _Selena Chiong_ had committed CBT of clients’ monies in her capacity as an advocate and solicitor. She had committed multiple offences - six CBT and one offence under the Legal Profession Act. She had not pleaded guilty to her charges. She did not make restitution. The total amount involved for the CBT charges was $12,900. In contrast, the Accused in the present case had pleaded guilty. The amount involved was considerably lower. The degree of breach of trust was also lower. The Accused had also made partial restitution of about one-third of the amount he had dishonestly misappropriated. For these reasons, I found that the downward adjustment proposed by DPP Goh was not sufficient to reflect the disparity in the degree of egregiousness between the two cases. In my view, the appropriate sentence in the present case should not exceed half of the sentence imposed in _Selena Chiong_. In this regard, I imposed two months’ imprisonment.

### The overstaying charge

36     The starting point for this charge was a fine ranging between $1,000 to $2,000 where the period of overstaying was between 15 to 30 days. A sampling of the relevant case precedents was set out below –

37     The Accused had overstayed for 17 days. In the absence of any further aggravating factors, I was of the opinion that a fine at the lowest end of the range was appropriate. Therefore, I imposed a fine of $1,000 in default one week’s imprisonment.

### s 307(1) Criminal Procedure Code order

38     Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 2012 Ed), I ordered the imprisonment sentences in the first MLA charge (DAC-911500-2021) and the CBT charge (DAC-919317-2021) to run consecutively. They were distinct offences with different protected legal interests. The total aggregate sentence was therefore five months’ imprisonment and fine $61,000 in default two months’ one week’s imprisonment. The imprisonment sentence was backdated to 19 June 2021.

## Conclusion

39     The accused person has lodged an appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his sentence.
