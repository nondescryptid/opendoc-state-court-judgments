## Undisputed facts and the issues at trial

4       The following background facts and circumstances surrounding the offences were largely undisputed at trial:

> (a)     The Accused, a Malaysian citizen, was the owner and sole director of a motor workshop, MK Motors Private Limited (“MK Motors”), which, in October 2012, was located at Blk 1001 Tai Seng Avenue. He was also the sole proprietor of MK Automotive Services (“MK Automotive”) which provided motor vehicle rental services.

> (b)     The Accused and Koh Moi Seng (“Koh”) were friends and had known each other for more than ten years. They first met at temple gatherings as they attended the same temple. Koh knew that the Accused was the owner of a motor workshop while the Accused knew that Koh was working for a construction company and drove a lorry issued by his company. Koh was married to Cham Geok Hoon (“Cham”), a housewife.

> (c)     On 18 October 2012, Koh lodged a Singapore Accident Statement at Kan Fook Sing Motor Workshop (Exhibit P1), stating that he was involved in an accident on 16 October 2012, at about 9pm, along Telok Blangah Street 31 (“the accident”). Koh stated that the accident involved three vehicles, SGS9364H (“V1”), SGP4939Z (“V2”) and SFP5041T (“V3”) and that it occurred in the following manner:

![]([2020] SGDC 0253_Image/[2020] SGDC 0253_image1.png)

> Koh stated that he was the driver of V1 at the timeof the accident. The registered owner of V1 was MK Automotive.

> (d)     It was not disputed that V2 was driven by its registered owner, Muhamad Shahriezad bin Sa’ad (“Shahriezad”) during the accident. After the accident, Shahriezad brought V2 to MK Motors for repairs. Shahriezad lodged a Singapore Accident Statement on 17 October 2012 (Exhibit P21) and was provided with a rental car by MK Automotive (Exhibit P22).

> (e)     On 18 October 2012, Abdillah bin Hassan Bagharib (“Abdillah”) filed a Singapore Accident Statement stating that he was the driver of V3 during the accident (Exhibit P27).

> (f)     AXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd (“AXA”), the insurers for V2, received the following documents in relation to V1’s involvement in the accident:

> (a)     On 7 July 2017, Abdillah made a police report stating _inter alia_ that the accident was a “scam” and he was in fact not at the scene and not the driver (Exhibit P28). Police investigations revealed that the accident was staged, and the following persons pleaded guilty to and were convicted of offences relating to the accident:

>> (i)       Shahriezad pleaded guilty on 19 July 2018 to one charge each for conspiracy to cheat CTI under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code, and for fabricating false evidence under section 193 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to a total of 13 months’ imprisonment (Exhibits P20 and D2).

>> (ii)       Abdillah pleaded guilty on 24 August 2018 to one charge for conspiracy to cheat CTI under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment (Exhibit P31).

>> (iii)       Koh pleaded guilty on 21 February 2019 to two charges for conspiring with the Accused to cheat AXA under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code, and was sentenced to 6 months’ and 3 months’ imprisonment respectively (Exhibits P12 and D1).

5       Cham was administered a stern warning by the police on 30 January 2018.

6       The prosecution’s case was that the Accused was aware that the accident was staged. He had recruited and conspired with Koh and Cham to cheat the insurance companies by falsely stating that they were the driver and passenger respectively in V1, thereby making fraudulent property damage as well as personal injury claims against the respective insurers.

7       The defence’s contention, in a nutshell, was that Koh had rented V1 from MK Automotive on 16 October 2012. When V1 was returned, it was found to be damaged. The Accused was not aware that the accident, which Koh claimed V1 was involved in, was staged. In addition, aside from submitting an estimation of repair costs for V1 (Exhibit P7), the Accused had no part to play in the personal injury claims made by Koh or Cham.

## The case for the prosecution

8       The prosecution called nine witnesses to prove its case against the Accused. The respective evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses is summarised below:

### PW1 – ASP Nick Lie Dai Cheng

9       ASP Nick Lie Dai Cheng (“ASP Lie”) from the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) was the investigating officer of the case against the Accused. The case came to the attention of CAD because of the police report lodged by Abdillah.

10     According to ASP Lie, in the course of investigations, the Accused claimed that he had rented V1 to Koh. As such, ASP Lie requested for a copy of the rental agreement. However, the Accused did not provide ASP Lie with the agreement.

### PW2 – Koh Moi Seng

11     Koh was a construction site supervisor with New Castle Builders Pte Ltd (“New Castle”) at the material time. He had primary school education and usually conversed in Mandarin and Hokkien. Koh did not own any vehicle but would drive his employer’s lorry to convey workers and goods. He would sometimes use the lorry to bring his family out.[^1] Koh worked six days a week. His normal working hours were from 6am to 7pm and he would reach home around 8 or 9pm. However, if he worked over-time, he would finish work at 10pm.[^2]

12     Koh addressed the Accused as “Ah Lak” or “Ah Tan”. Koh knew that the Accused was working in the motor workshop industry. At times, Koh would be invited by the Accused to attend the Accused’s company’s year-end celebrations. Koh and the Accused would usually communicate in Hokkien or Teochew. Koh had been to the Accused’s workshop as he had used his company’s lorry to assist the Accused when the Accused relocated his workshop. Koh would also visit the Accused’s workshop to obtain small spare parts.[^3]

13     Koh testified that the Accused had requested his assistance to “claim insurance” by admitting that he drove a vehicle involved in an accident. Koh was initially reluctant to do so, but the Accused assured him that it would be fine. The Accused explained that Koh was to be the driver of the first vehicle. As such, all claims would be directed at the vehicles behind and no one would claim against the first vehicle. Koh also asked the Accused whether it would be against the law, but the Accused told him not to worry as the Accused had lawyers and “official people in the government” and things would be fine. Koh agreed to help the Accused as they had been friends for a long time, and he thought he was doing his friend a favour.[^4]

14     On 18 October 2012, Koh was at a worksite when he received calls from the Accused telling him to go to the Accused’s workshop. At the workshop, the Accused showed V1 to Koh and Koh saw that the rear potion of the vehicle was damaged.

15     Thereafter, the Accused brought Koh to lodge a report and Koh recalled he was given documents to sign. The Accused merely sat at one side and coached Koh on lodging the report. Koh could not recall if he signed the Singapore Accident Statement in Exhibit P1, as his signature was “longer” whereas the signature in Exhibit P1 was “shorter and wider”. Koh had never used V1 before and did not know how it got damaged. However, the Accused explained by using a drawing and told Koh where the damage was caused. During cross-examination, Koh explained that vehicle numbers were written in the Accused’s drawing of the accident. Koh did not know who had drawn the sketch plan or written the circumstances of the accident in Exhibit P1. Those were not his words but told to him by the Accused and the Accused’s “friend” when they were at the Accused’s workshop.[^5]

16     On 18 October 2012, the Accused also brought Koh to see a doctor at Kong Kian Clinic. The Accused explained to Koh that this was so that Koh could obtain a medical certificate for two days in order to make an insurance claim. Koh was instructed by the Accused to tell the doctor that he suffered neck pain as a result of an accident where his vehicle was knocked into. The Accused also gave Koh $50 to pay for the medical fees. After seeing the doctor, Koh received a medical certificate and receipt from the clinic (Exhibits P2 and P3 respectively) and handed them to the Accused.[^6]

17     Subsequently, Koh signed a Warrant to Act dated 1 November 2012 appointing M/s K Krishna & Partners to act for him in a personal injury claim relating to the accident (Exhibit P4). Koh had never gone to the law firm and was not aware of the contents of the Warrant. However, he was told by someone from the Accused’s workshop that it was required procedure to sign the Warrant to Act and he did so accordingly. Thereafter, the law firm did send letters to Koh but he threw them away as he did not engage nor instruct the law firm to act for him.[^7]

18     On 18 October 2012, the Accused also asked Koh to tell his wife to pretend to be the front seat passenger of V1 so as to make the accident more realistic. The Accused told Koh to call Cham and instruct her to see a doctor. Cham repeatedly told Koh that she did not want to do so but eventually relented after much persuasion from Koh. After Cham went to see the doctor, she passed the medical certificate and receipt (Exhibits P8 and P9 respectively) to Koh and Koh in turn passed them to the Accused.[^8]

19     Subsequently, Cham received letters from a law firm and Koh called the Accused to enquire about them. Koh was informed by the Accused that this was “required procedures”. As such, Koh accompanied Cham twice when she went to the law firm.[^9] During cross-examination, Koh clarified that he had in fact accompanied Cham to a law firm once but had waited for her downstairs. On the other occasion, Koh recalled accompanying Cham to a place near the State Courts. Koh further explained that the lawyers were acting upon instructions from the workshop and Koh and Cham had not looked for lawyers to handle the claims for them as they did not intend to make personal injury claims.[^10]

20     Koh testified that he did not rent V1 from the Accused on the day of the accident as it was his workday and he had no need to rent a vehicle. The entries in his work record card in Exhibit P16 showed that he was working at the worksites at Tagore Lane and Jalan Tukang on 16 October 2012. In fact, on that day, Koh had finished work at about 10pm. This was evidenced by his signature in the work record card relating to a worker named Jinna in Exhibit P14. Specifically, the record in Exhibit P14 showed that Jinna had worked 5½ hours over-time from 5pm until 10.30pm on 16 October 2012, and Koh had endorsed his signature on the card when Jinna boarded Koh’s lorry for his transport home that night.[^11]

21     Koh did not receive any money from the Accused in relation to the accident.[^12]

22     Koh testified that while he was under investigations, the Accused arranged to meet him at Sin Ming Road and told him to tell the investigating officer that he had rented V1 from the Accused. In response, Koh told the Accused to settle the matter himself as Koh did not rent V1.[^13]

### PW3 – Chua Tiong Kee

23     Chua Tiong Kee (“Chua”) was the managing director of New Castle. He testified that New Castle’s policy was to keep the original work record cards of its employees for a period of five years and would dispose of them thereafter. Thus, the original copies of the October 2012 work record cards of its employee Jinna was no longer available at the time of the trial.

24     Chua explained that the work record cards of the workers would show the timing of work. On the first day of each month, the work record cards of the workers would be handed over to the office for the purposes of computing the workers’ salaries. On the other hand, a supervisor like Koh was paid on a monthly basis. As such, Koh would only be required to state the worksite which he went to, without keeping time records.[^14]

25     Based on New Castle’s payroll summary file records in Exhibit P17, Chua confirmed that on 16 October 2012, Jinna worked at the worksite at Tagore Lane from 8am to 10.30pm and that Koh’s signature appeared in the record.[^15]

### PW4 – Muhamad Shahriezad bin Sa’ad

26     Shahriezad testified that he was invited by his reservist friend Nazar (PW9 -- Mohammed Nazar bin Bujang) to participate in creating an accident using Shahriezad’s car, V2. Nazar informed Shahriezad that three cars would be involved, and that V2 would be the middle car. The accident would be staged by having the first car and Shahriezad’s car come to a stop, whereupon the last car would hit the rear of Shahriezad’s car. Nazar also told Shahriezad that he could send V2 to the workshop thereafter, and Nazar would “deal with it”. Shahriezad agreed to the offer as Nazar assured him that it was “safe”.[^16]

27     On the day of the accident, Shahriezad drove V2 to Telok Blangah at about 9pm. Thereat, he saw two or three other cars and some people standing nearby. Nazar had also driven there in his own car. After Nazar had spoken with some of the people there, he sat in the passenger seat of V2 and gave instructions to Shahriezad to start driving when the first car moved off. They drove to Telok Blangah Road and staged the accident in the manner earlier described by Nazar.[^17]

28     After the accident, Shahriezad drove Nazar back to where he parked his car and followed him thereafter to a workshop called “MK” at MacPherson. As the workshop was closed, Shahriezad left V2 there and took a lift from Nazar to go home.[^18]

29     The next day, Nazar picked Shahriezad up from his home and sent him to the workshop. At the workshop, Nazar spoke to the Accused and told him that V2 was involved in an accident. The Accused then told Shahriezad to lodge an “IDAC report”[^19] and to pass the Accused the report so that he could make a claim for the cost of repairs of V2. Shahriezad proceeded to lodge the report in Exhibit P21. The licence plate numbers of the other vehicles involved in the accident were provided to Shahriezad by Nazar.[^20]

30     After lodging the report, the Shahriezad went back to the workshop where the Accused asked him to sign a rental agreement for a replacement car with MK Automotive (Exhibit P22).[^21] At that time, Shahriezad was not aware who was supposed to repair V2 and he merely followed Nazar’s directions. Subsequently, after V2 was repaired, Shahriezad returned the rental vehicle and picked up V2 from the workshop.[^22] As far as Shahriezad was concerned, he was never asked to pay for the repairs of V2.[^23]

31     After staging the accident, Nazar also suggested that Shahriezad see a doctor and thereafter go to Prestige Legal LLP with the medical certificate to instruct them to act for him and make a personal injury claim. Consequently, Prestige Legal LLP issued a letter dated 14 February 2013 to CTI for Shahriezad’s personal injury claim. (Exhibit P25).[^24]

32     Sometime later, the Accused told Shahriezad that he was unable to claim damages from V3’s insurers with respect to V2 and suggested that Shahriezad make a personal claim through the lawyers. Shahriezad then went to the lawyer’s office with the Accused and signed the Warrant to Act dated 16 April 2013 in Exhibit P23, appointing M/s Tng Soon Chye & Co to commence legal proceedings in his name and take instructions from MK Motors.[^25] Shahriezad was aware that M/s Tng Soon Chye sent a letter to CTI dated 9 April 2013 on a property damage claim in relation to V2 (Exhibit P24).[^26] According to Shahriezad, the Accused also initiated court proceedings in Shahriezad’s name in relation to the property damage claim. Shahriezad had affirmed the affidavit in Exhibit P26A in support of the claim.[^27]

33     Subsequently, a person claiming to be Abdillah’s friend contacted Shahriezad and arranged for them to meet at a S-11 coffeeshop at Ho Ching Road. Shahriezad was aware that Abdillah was the driver of the car behind V2 during the accident. At the coffeeshop, Shahriezad noticed that Abdillah and his friend smelt strongly of alcohol. Abdillah asked Shahriezad why Shahriezad had sued him concerning the repair costs for V2. Shahriezad replied that he did not know, and it was up to the workshop. Abdillah then requested that Shahriezad speak to the “boss” of the workshop to settle the matter out of Court. Following this meeting, Shahriezad called the Accused and told him about Abdillah’s request. Shahriezad did not pursue the matter further because he did not have to pay anything and Abdillah was the one who needed to pay.[^28]

34     Sometime later, Shahriezad met the Accused at a KFC in Woodlands at a meeting arranged by Abdillah to “settle out of Court”. The meeting was attended by Abdillah and his friend Puvan, as well as the Accused and Shahriezad. During the meeting, Abdillah spoke to the Accused in English and Malay about settling the matter and asked the Accused for instalment payment.[^29]

### PW5 – Abdillah Bin Hassan Bagharib

35     Abdillah testified that he was approached by his friend Puvan to sign an “IDAC report” in return for $200 cash. As such, he signed the Singapore Accident Statement in Exhibit P27. However, when Abdillah signed Exhibit P27 at a “LAN” shop in Yishun, it was blank, and he was not sure how the sketch plan and the handwritten account of the accident were inserted at page 3. Further, contrary to what was stated in Exhibit P27, Abdillah was not the driver of V3 at the time of the accident and had never seen V3 before.[^30]

36     Subsequently, Abdillah started receiving letters (which were similar to Exhibit P24) relating to the accident. He then realised that he was reported as the driver of V3.[^31] As the insurance companies were starting to feel suspicious, Abdillah took Puvan’s advice and affirmed a statutory declaration dated 21 August 2013, falsely stating that he was involved in the accident on 16 October 2012 (Exhibit P30).[^32]

37     Abdillah was sued in Court as the insurers refused to pay out on the damages claimed. He was also called up by the insurer’s investigator and informed that the accident was staged.[^33]

38     According to Abdillah, Puvan had mentioned one “Ah Tan” to him many times and told him that it was “Ah Tan” who “gave” the staged accident to Puvan. Subsequently, Puvan told Abdillah that “Ah Tan” called for a meeting of all the parties involved in the accident at KFC. Abdillah met “Ah Tan”, whom he identified as the Accused, for the first time at this meeting. The other people present at the meeting were Puvan, Shahriezad, Shahriezad’s friend, and another old Chinese man. At the meeting, Abdillah learnt that Shahriezad’s car was repaired by MK Motors, and because the insurers refused to pay for the damages, Shahriezad was upset that he might have to pay the repair costs. During the meeting, Abdillah asked the Accused to settle for the sum of $5000 (to be shared between Puvan and Abdillah) and close the case, but the Accused declined the offer. The Accused also said that Puvan was a “bad person” and asked Puvan to clear up the “mess”. Abdillah told the Accused that if the Accused did not accept the offer, he would report the matter to the authorities, but the Accused responded saying he was “not scared”. [^34]

39     During cross-examination, Abdillah explained that when he made the offer of $5000 to the Accused, it was to settle the claim against him. At that time, Abdillah was not aware which vehicle’s damages he was paying for. Abdillah was more focused on the amount of $16,000 stated in the letters he received as he was concerned about what he had to pay.[^35]

40     Sometime later, Abdillah received a letter from debt collectors stating that he owed a sum of $23,102.53 to MK Motors (Exhibit P29).[^36] During cross-examination, Abdillah added that he had in fact received such letters thrice and he started to become angry. He proceeded to call one of the debt collectors and asked to meet with them. During the meeting, Abdillah asked the debt collectors who instructed them and they said it was MK Motors.[^37]

41     Eventually, on 7 July 2017, Abdillah made a police report detailing the events leading up to, and following the staging of the accident (Exhibit P28). Abdillah clarified that there were some inaccuracies therein. Firstly, Abdillah confirmed that he was first approached by Puvan in 2012 instead of in 2014 as stated in Exhibit P28. Secondly, Abdillah also confirmed that he had offered $5000 (instead of $3000 as stated in Exhibit P28) to the Accused to settle the accident claims. Abdillah explained that he was not in the right frame of mind and was in a rage when he lodged the report. This was because he had gone to make the police report straightaway after speaking to the debt collectors who were “making \[him\] crazy”.[^38]

42     In the course of the ensuing police investigations, Abdillah met the Accused at “Cantonment” when he went to report to the investigating officer. Abdillah started swearing at the Accused as he blamed the Accused for the “mess” he was in. In response, the Accused told Abdillah to calm down and “shut up”. Abdillah then told the Accused “now it’s your turn … good luck to you”.[^39]

### PW6 – Ekhsan Khalil

43     Ekhsan Khalil (“Ekhsan”) was a claims executive and in-house investigator with AXA.

44     He testified that AXA received the letter in Exhibit P5 on 15 March 2013, setting out a claim for $6314.70 in relation to personal injuries suffered by Koh during the accident. AXA has not paid out on this claim because AXA was notified that this might be a fraudulent claim. In such situations, AXA would stop any payment and work with the authorities.[^40]

45     Ekhsan gave evidence that AXA’s claim department received the letter in Exhibit P10 on 28 October 2013, which set out a claim for $4222.50 in relation to personal injuries suffered by Cham during the accident. Similarly, no payment was made by AXA for this claim, as the insurers were notified of the possibility of a fraudulent claim. [^41]

46     Ekhsan stated that on 24 April 2013, AXA received the document dated 16 Oct 2012 in Exhibit P7 which was submitted by MK Motors, through the insurer’s adjuster, to AXA. The total amount submitted by MK Motors was $17,930.20. AXA did not pay out on this claim it was suspected to be a fraudulent claim.[^42]

47     On 2 April 2014, AXA received the letter in Exhibit P11, dated 1 April 2014 from K. Krishna & Partners enclosing a copy of the Writ of Summons, giving notice that Cham had commenced proceedings in Court against Shahriezad and Abdillah (Exhibit P32).[^43]

### PW7 – Chee So Chow

48     Chee So Chow (“Chee”) was a claims manager with CTI.

49     Chee testified that CTI received the letter in Exhibit P6 on 14 March 2013, in relation to a personal injury claim for Koh against the driver of V3, who was insured by CTI. The total amount claimed was $6314.70. As CTI discovered that the case was “tainted” in that there were inconsistencies in the damages, it engaged an investigator to look into the matter and commence investigations against the insured driver.[^44]

50     On 27 January 2014, CTI received the letter in Exhibit P11, setting out a personal injury claim for Cham against the driver of V3, for the total sum of $4222,50. CTI similarly did not pay out on this claim because it was “tainted”.[^45]

51     Subsequently, CTI received the letter from K. Krishna & Partners dated 19 May 2015 in Exhibit P33, forwarding a copy of the final judgement against Abdillah in the suit commenced by Cham. CTI did not take any further steps in relation to the matter as they had repudiated the claim by then. The reason for the repudiation was two-fold. Firstly, the damages were not consistent and secondly, the terms of the insurance policy had been breached as Abdillah had not been authorised by the registered owner of V3 to drive the vehicle.[^46]

### PW8 – Cham Geok Hoon

52     Cham was a housewife. She testified that she and her husband Koh did not own any vehicle, nor had they rented any vehicle for their own use. However, Koh could use his employer’s lorry.

53     Cham did not know the Accused, but Koh had mentioned one “Ah Tan” to her before and told her that he got to know “Ah Tan” at a temple event. Cham was told that “Ah Tan” would also bring many lawyer friends along for some of these events.[^47]

54     According to Cham, she was not involved in any accident on 16 October 2012. However, “Ah Tan” told Koh to request for Cham’s help by putting her name as a front seat passenger to make an accident look more convincing. Cham was required to lie to the doctor by saying that there was an accident and that she had sprained her neck. Cham was initially reluctant to do so, but Koh persisted in asking her to help. As Cham understood that Koh had already “helped” “Ah Tan” and since Koh told her that “Ah Tan” said that it would be alright because “Ah Tan” knew many lawyer friends and government officials, Cham eventually relented. She proceeded to see the doctor at Jireh Family Clinic on the same day (18 October 2012) and received a medical certificate (Exhibit P8) and a receipt (Exhibit P9). She passed the documents to Koh so that they could be handed to “Ah Tan”.[^48]

55     Cham recalled signing the Warrant to Act dated 9 November 2012 in Exhibit P19. She explained that this was sent to her house for her to sign. Before she signed, Koh had called “Ah Tan” to enquire about the matter and “Ah Tan” said it would be fine.[^49] Cham had also signed the Accident Statement dated 9 November 2012 in Exhibit P34 which had also been sent to her house. Cham testified that she had signed it without understanding the contents because “Ah Tan” had asked for her help through Koh, to sign all the documents and to pass them to him.[^50] During cross-examination, Cham explained that on her request, Koh would call “Ah Tan” in her presence and speak to “Ah Tan” in Teochew dialect to ask “Ah Tan” whether it was alright for Cham to sign the documents which were sent to her by the law firm. Cham also testified the lawyer was engaged by “Ah Tan” because nobody else would engage a lawyer for her. Although Cham signed the Warrant to Act, she did not engage the lawyer or pay for the lawyer’s services.[^51]

56     When asked about the letters of demand in Exhibits P10 and P11, Cham testified that she was unaware of the claims K. Krishna & Partners had made on her behalf. Cham was similarly unaware that court proceedings were commenced for her personal injury claim or that the action was subsequently discontinued against Shahriezad (as shown in Exhibit P35).[^52]

57     Cham recalled that she had gone to a law firm once to sign documents relating to the accident. Cham had gone to the law firm because the lawyers sent her a letter requesting her attendance. Before going to the law firm, Koh had called “Ah Tan” to ask if everything would be alright and “Ah Tan” told Koh that it was “just procedure”.[^53] At the law firm, Cham signed the affidavit dated 13 March 2015 in Exhibit P36. Cham testified that while she was at the law firm, a lady explained to her about the accident, the date, place and vehicle registration numbers. In Court, Cham confirmed that the contents of the affidavit concerning her being a front seat passenger in V1 driven by Koh was false. Cham explained that she signed the affidavit as “Ah Tan” had asked her husband to help.[^54]

58     According to Cham, she was at home at about 9pm on 16 October 2012 and Koh was also at home, having returned from work.[^55] During cross-examination, Cham added that Koh would usually be home around 8pm and would drive his company’s lorry home. However, Koh would be home late if he was working overtime. Cham also clarified that she had forgotten whether Koh was home at 9pm on the night of the accident as her impression was that he was at home every night.[^56]

59     Cham testified that she did not receive any payment from the court proceedings initiated in her name nor from “Ah Tan” for helping him.[^57]

### PW9 – Mohammed Nazar bin Bujang

60     Mohammed Nazar bin Bujang (“Nazar”) first got to know one Ng Wei Xiang (“Ah Xiang”) at a coffeeshop. “Ah Xiang” told Nazar that he worked at a car workshop. In the course of their conversations, “Ah Xiang” also mentioned staged accident to Nazar. “Ah Xiang” asked Nazar to ask around if anyone was interested, and if so, to give “Ah Xiang” a call.[^58]

61     Shahriezad was Nazar’s reservist mate. Sometime during reservist, Nazar was chatting with several people including Shahriezad when he told them about staged accident. Subsequently, Shahriezad called Nazar to ask if the opportunity to stage an accident was still available and Nazar told Shahriezad he would check with “Ah Xiang”. A few days later, Nazar called and told “Ah Xiang” about this and was told to wait for “Ah Xiang’s” call. Eventually, “Ah Xiang” instructed Nazar to tell Shahriezad to meet at Bukit Merah where further instructions would be provided.[^59]

62     On the night when the accident was to be staged, Nazar and Shahriezad drove their own vehicles to rendezvous at Bukit Merah. Nazar parked his car and they both proceeded in Shahriezad’s car to meet the rest at a petrol station at Bukit Merah Road.

63     Thereat, Nazar noticed several men but did not see “Ah Xiang”. Nazar alighted from Shahriezad’s car to speak to the people there and was given instructions for Shahriezad to drive off and follow the car in front. Shahriezad did as instructed. According to Nazar, they went “round and round” the Bukit Merah and Telok Blangah area for 20 to 30 minutes. At one point of time, the car in front slowed down and stopped and Shahriezad followed suit. Suddenly, they were collided into by a car behind them.[^60]

64     After the accident, Nazar alighted from Shahriezad’s car and noticed that there were a few people standing at the car behind and one person standing at the car in front. They were told to proceed to the workshop in Tai Seng called “ADSM”. Shahriezad drove Nazar to collect his car and thereafter, Nazar led the way to the workshop as he had been there before to service his car and it was where “Ah Xiang” was working. As the workshop was closed, Shahriezad left his car there and Nazar sent him home. Nazar recalled “Ah Xiang” giving instructions for Shahriezad to return to the workshop the next day to lodge a report.[^61] “Ah Xiang” also asked Nazar to inform Shahriezad to include the names of persons for whom he wanted to make injury claims in the report, as well as to obtain a medical certificate for each person, including himself.[^62]

65     The following day, Nazar dropped by the workshop to check if Shahriezad had made the report. He saw that Shahriezad was already waiting outside the workshop to go to the office upstairs. Nazar waited for Shahriezad downstairs while Shahriezad went to the office. Although Shahriezad later came downstairs to tell Nazar that he was going to make a report, Nazar did not know where the report was lodged as he did not follow Shahriezad. After Nazar learnt that Shahriezad would be provided a car by the workshop, Nazar left the workshop and proceeded back to work.

66     According to Nazar, he did not know the registration numbers of the cars involved in the staged accident as he was not the driver and his car was not involved. Nazar thought Shahriezad would obtain the particulars of the other vehicles at the workshop. Nazar did not know how Shahriezad came to have the particulars of the vehicles as stated in his Singapore Accident Statement in Exhibit P21. After the accident, Nazar recalled informing “Ah Xiang” to contact Shahriezad directly.[^63]

67     Subsequently, Shahriezad would update Nazar whenever he needed to go to the workshop. Shahriezad also told Nazar that the claim was a hassle and he had to go to the workshop every month or two. Although “Ah Xiang” had promised to pay Nazar some “coffee money” for his referral, Nazar did not receive any payment for referring Shahriezad to “Ah Xiang” because “Ah Xiang” told him that the claims were not successful. Nazar also did not give Shahriezad any money for his help in staging the accident.[^64]

68     Nazar testified that he had never met the Accused before nor communicated with him. However, Shahriezad had mentioned one “Ah Tan” to Nazar and told Nazar he had to meet “Ah Tan” at the workshop.[^65]

69     As a result of his involvement in the staged accident, Nazar pleaded guilty on 15 March 2019 to two charges for conspiracy to cheat CTI under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 7 months’ and 4 months’ imprisonment respectively, with the two sentences to run concurrently (Exhibits P37 and D3).[^66]

## The case for the defence

70     At the close of the prosecution’s case, I found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the Accused on the proceeded charges and called upon the Accused to give evidence in his own defence. The Accused elected to testify, and he was the sole witness for the defence.

### DW1 – Tan Mong Keng

71     The Accused held an Employment Pass and had been doing business in Singapore for the past 30 to 40 years. At the material time, the Accused resided in Johor but would travel to Singapore for work on a daily basis.[^67]

72     The Accused was Teochew, but was able to speak Hokkien, Malay, Mandarin and a little Cantonese. Generally, the Accused would speak to Koh in Hokkien, Mandarin as well as Teochew.[^68]

73     According to the Accused, on 16 October 2012, Koh came to the Accused’s office at MK Motors in “Kim Chuan” to rent a car for “one to two days” and promised to pay $50 per day for the rental.[^69] During cross-examination, the Accused explain that by “Kim Chuan” he was referring to MK Motors’ address at Blk 1001 Tai Seng Avenue, #1-2532 as shown in Exhibit P7. The Accused also clarified that MK Motors did not provide car rental services and rental was only provided by MK Automotive.[^70]

74     The following day, the Accused arrived at his office around 1 to 2pm, and noticed a damaged vehicle, V2, at the workshop. By then, Shahriezad, the owner of the vehicle, had already made an accident report and came to speak to the Accused. The Accused explained that he did not complete primary school education and could not understand English. He also did not know how to draw an accident sketch plan. As such, his employees, “Ah Seng” and “Agnes” would be the ones attending to customers who wished to make an accident report. During cross-examination, the Accused agreed that he could have been the one who asked Shahriezad to lodge the accident report.[^71]

75     At the same time, the Accused also noticed that V1, the car he had rented to Koh, was also at the workshop. The Accused saw that V1 had been damaged in its rear and called Koh to enquire. Koh informed the Accused that he did not have time that day and would make a report on 18 October 2012 instead.[^72]

76     The next day, Koh came to the workshop in the afternoon and was attended to by “Ah Seng”. The Accused told Koh that since there was an accident, Koh should go and make a report. However, as the Accused was unsure of the procedures for lodging a report, he told Koh that his workers would assist Koh. The Accused did not give Koh the sketch plan of the accident in Exhibit P1. Further, the accident report form was not available at the Accused’s workshop. The Accused denied accompanying Koh to make the report or see a doctor at the clinic. He also did not provide $50 to Koh. In fact, Koh did not tell the Accused that he was injured in the accident or that his wife was a passenger in the car at the time of the accident.[^73]

77     The Accused testified that he had no reason to request Koh to be a phantom driver in a staged accident; neither did he suggest that Koh’s wife be a phantom passenger. He did not instruct a lawyer to act on their behalf for their personal injury claims as these claims did not concern him. The Accused was only concerned about the property damage claim. The Accused told the Court that Koh was pushing the blame to him because he was claiming for the property damage.[^74]

78     It was shortly after 18 October 2012 that the Accused realised that V2 had in fact collided into V1 in the same accident. However, he was initially unaware that they were involved in a staged accident. It was only after the Accused’s workshop submitted insurance claims for both vehicles but no payment was received that the Accused came to be aware of this. As the repair costs amounted to about $5000 to $6000, the Accused arranged to meet with the parties involved at the KFC in Woodlands to try and recover the sum.[^75] During cross-examination however, the Accused alleged that it was not him but Shahriezad who arranged to meet at KFC.[^76]

79     During cross-examination, the Accused testified that when a customer came to him to rent a car, the customer would have to provide his NRIC and driver’s licence, as well as address and contact number. These details, as well as the model of the car being rented, the applicable charges, and duration of the rental would be recorded in a standard rental agreement form (such as that in Exhibit P22). A copy would be provided to the customer while the company would keep one for record. However, as the Accused did not know how to fill up such forms, they would be filled up by the clerk. The Accused agreed that it was important to have this form for record as it was proof of the agreement between MK Automotive and the customer. The form also stated that should a rental vehicle be damaged in an accident, the customer would be liable to pay part of the damages assessed (i.e. the first $1500) as well as the loss of earnings while the damaged vehicle was undergoing repair. However, if a customer did not wish to pay for the damages, the Accused would not engage debt collectors to collect payment. Instead, he would ask the customer to pay by way of instalments.[^77]

80     In relation to the damage to V1, the Accused did not try to recover the first $1,500 from Koh. This was because Koh never signed a rental agreement for V1, and the rental was based on an oral agreement between the Accused and Koh. According to the Accused, his friends would just pay him $50 to rent a car and it was not necessary to issue the rental form.[^78] When queried by the Court, the Accused confirmed that he never received any rental from Koh for V1. Although the Accused had asked Koh for the sum of $100 for two days’ rental on a few occasions, Koh kept telling the Accused that he was only a worker and did not have money.[^79]

81     The Accused agreed that in his cautioned statement in Exhibit P38, he had stated that he had “lost the rental form that proved that Mr Koh had rented the car from \[him\]”. He explained that the “form” he was referring to was a “paper” which came from a book used to record the cars which he lent to friends or which were driven by employees to Malaysia. The Accused added that he discovered that the whole book had gone missing when he searched for it in 2017.[^80] The Accused explained that this was due to the fact that he had moved his office and some of the clerks were no longer working for him.[^81]

82     According to the Accused, if a car rented from MK Automotive were returned damaged, the repairs would be done by MK Motors. The workers would check the damage to the car as well as the spare parts required for repairs within one to two days. Thereafter, MK Motors would do an estimation of the repair costs before calling upon the surveyor. The Accused agreed that Exhibit P7 was prepared by MK Motors and submitted for the purpose of insurance claims. The surveyor would come by thereafter to ensure things were in order before processing the claim. The Accused was aware that the estimated costs in Exhibit P7 was being submitted to the insurers.[^82]

83     As for the damage to V2, the Accused told Shahriezad that he had to appoint a lawyer because the workshop was unable to claim the repair costs from the insurers. He then brought Shahriezad to the law firm, Tng Soon Chye & Co, and was present when Shahriezad signed the Warrant to Act in Exhibit P23, authorising the lawyers to take instructions from MK Motors.[^83]

## Analysis of the evidence and the Courts’ findings

84     The main issue at trial was whether the Accused had recruited Koh and Cham to pose as phantom driver and passenger respectively in a staged accident, in an attempt to cheat the insurance companies. In essence, the case turned on whether to accept the evidence of Koh and Cham, or that of the Accused.

85     Having carefully considered all the evidence placed before me, I was of the view that Koh and Cham were truthful and forthright witnesses who were able to provide clear and consistent accounts as to the material facts in issue. Their evidence on the salient facts remained unshaken during cross-examination. Conversely, I found that the Accused’s version lacked credibility, and rejected his claim that he was unaware that the accident was staged and was not involved in any attempts to make false claims against the insurance companies.

86     I set out the analyses for my findings below.

### Koh did not rent V1 from the Accused

87     I start with the main plank of the defence’s case, which was that Koh had rented V1 from the Accused on 16 October 2012 and returned it the next day in a damaged state.

88     Koh gave coherent and consistent testimony that he had never rented V1 from the Accused. He explained that he was working on 16 October 2012 until past 10 pm, and thus would not have rented a car. Koh’s testimony was corroborated by the contemporaneous business records kept by his employer, New Castle (Exhibits P14, P16, P17 and P18). They showed that Koh was indeed working on 16 October 2012 and had countersigned the work record card of a worker who worked overtime until 10.30pm that day, when he sent the worker home in the company’s lorry.

89     On the other hand, the Accused’s claim that Koh had gone to his workshop on 16 October 2012 to rent V1 was not supported by any objective evidence. Instead, the Accused provided inconsistent accounts when he was asked about the records of the rental.

90     Firstly, in his statement recorded on 11 August 2017 (Exhibit P39), the Accused was asked if Koh had signed any documents to show that he had rented V1. The Accused responded that he could not remember:

> **“Q7**.     **Do you have documents which showed that Koh had rented the vehicle (SGS9364H) from you on the 16 October 2012 in which he had signed on it?**

> A7.    I cannot remember but I need to check with my records. Will get back to you again.”

91     It was interesting to note that it was only when he was cross-examined by the prosecution in Court that the Accused first mentioned that Koh had in fact never signed a rental agreement for V1 and that the rental was based on an oral agreement between them. The reason provided by the Accused was that his friends would only pay him a token sum of $50 per day to rent a car, and since the Accused had to “pay GST” for each rental form he issued, there was no need to issue the form to his friends. When the prosecution pointed out to the Accused that in his cautioned statement recorded on 11 July 2018 (Exhibit P38), he stated had that “… I had lost the rental form that proved that Mr Koh had rented the car from me…”, the Accused then claimed that by “rental form” he was referring to a piece of paper in a book used to keep records of cars borrowed by his friends or driven by his employees to Malaysia. The Accused added that he was unable to find this book as he had moved office.

92     In my view, the Accused’s evolving versions concerning records of the rental indicated that these were mere afterthoughts concocted to support his assertion that Koh had rented V1 from him. Further, it was not disputed that the Accused had never collected any payment from Koh in relation to V1. To my mind, this served to further cast doubt on the Accused’s version and bolster the prosecution’s case that Koh had never rented or driven V1.

93     In relation to the rental fee for V1, it was in response to queries from the Court that the Accused first mentioned that he had asked Koh for the rental fee of $100 on a few occasions, but Koh did not pay and gave the excuse that he did not have money. It was pertinent to note that these facts concerning Koh’s non-payment of the rental fee were never put to him in Court.

94     As for the repair costs of V1, there was no evidence before the Court that the Accused had ever discussed this issue with Koh, or made any attempt to ask Koh to contribute towards those costs. The Accused also admitted that he did not inform Koh about the meeting at Woodlands KFC with those involved in the accident, even though Koh owed him money for damaging V1.[^84] Indeed, if the Accused had genuinely rented V1 to Koh on 16 October 2012, and, as a result, V1 sustained damages estimated by the Accused’s workshop to cost more than $17,000 to repair (Exhibit P7), it would be reasonable to expect the Accused to have at least broached the subject with Koh. This was especially so when, based on the Accused’s version, he subsequently learnt that V1 was involved in a staged accident and that he was unable to claim any damages from the insurers.

95     In conclusion, having studied the evidence carefully, I rejected the Accused’s claim that Koh had rented V1 from him. Instead I accepted Koh’s evidence that he did not rent V1 from the Accused nor drive it on 16 October 2012.

### The Accused had recruited Koh and Cham, thereby engaging them in a conspiracy to cheat the insurance companies

96     I next turned to consider the evidence relating to the Accused’s knowledge of the staged accident and his involvement in the conspiracy with Koh and Cham to cheat the insurance companies.

97     In this regard, Koh provided a detailed and cogent account of how he was first approached by the Accused to put his name as a driver in an accident, so as to “claim insurance”. Koh and Cham also provided consistent and mutually corroborative evidence concerning the Accused asking Koh to persuade Cham to pose as a passenger to make the accident more realistic.

98     In their submissions, the defence argued that Koh gave inconsistent evidence that raised “many doubts”.[^85] The defence alleged that Koh had given contradicting evidence concerning who had produced the drawing or sketch plan of the accident.[^86] Having carefully reviewed Koh’s evidence in this regard, I was of the view that the alleged inconstancies cited by the defence were more apparent than real, and did not detract from Koh’s overall credibility. Koh’s evidence, read in its proper context, showed that he was in fact referring to two different drawings or sketches. The first was the one shown to him by the Accused when the Accused briefed him on the details of the staged accident, while the second was the sketch plan which appeared in Exhibit P1. In fact, during re-examination, Koh had clarified that he believed there were two different drawings – one made by the Accused and the other (referring to the sketch plan in Exhibit P1) was given to him at the Accused’s workshop.[^87]

99     The defence also submitted that that Koh had contradicted himself in relation to the Warrant to Act in Exhibit P4 and whether he had been to K. Krishna & Partners. The defence argued that Koh had testified in Court that he could not recall the Warrant to Act, and that he had not been to K Krishna & Partners. The defence alleged that this contradicted the facts which Koh admitted to when he pleaded guilty (Exhibit D1), which stated that “he signed the Warrant to Act on 2 November 2012 at law firm of K. Krishna & Partners”; as well as his testimony that he had accompanied Cham to K. Krishna & Partners twice.[^88]

100    These arguments were, in my view, wholly misconceived. As pointed out by the prosecution in their reply submissions,[^89] the statement of facts that Koh admitted to in Court when he pleaded guilty did not state that Koh had signed the Warrant to Act at the premises of K Krishna & Partners (see Exhibit D1 at \[16\]). Further, Koh did not testify that he could not recall the Warrant to Act in Exhibit P4. On the contrary, Koh could remember signing the Warrant but could not recall specifically who in the Accused’s workshop had passed it to him[^90]:

> Q    Alright. I'll refer you to a document which is at tab 3, this is a Warrant to Act. It's regarding a personal injury accident on 16th October 2012 involving 3 vehicles along Telok Blangah Street 13, it s---states that you, Koh Moi Seng were appointing the law firm K Krishna & Parters---Partners to act for you in that matter. And there is a signature at the bottom. Can you confirm this is your signature?

> A    Yes.

101    In addition, Koh had clearly explained what he meant when he testified that he had accompanied Cham to the law firm twice, after she received letters from the lawyers. He clarified that on one occasion, he had waited for Cham downstairs and did not go up to the law firm with her. On another occasion, he had accompanied her to a place near the State Courts.[^91]

102    From the above, it was quite clear that Koh did not give contradictory evidence on the points highlighted by the defence. In fact, as shall be discussed later in these grounds, it was the Accused who gave different versions concerning the Warrants to Act signed by Koh and Cham.

103    Overall, I found Koh and Cham’s evidence on the material facts relating to the conspiracy to be both internally and externally consistent. Having had the benefit of observing them testify in Court, they struck me to be simple and straightforward individuals who had displayed no tendency to embellish their evidence or to testify on areas which they could not recall.

104    In fact, Koh candidly informed the Court, during examination-in-chief, that he was “not too sure” if he had signed the sketch plan in Exhibit P1 as he believed that his signature was “longer”.[^92] During cross examination, Koh also agreed with the defence’s suggestion that the signature was not his.[^93] In their submissions, the defence leveraged on this to allege that Exhibit P1 was not Koh’s accident statement.[^94] However, as pointed out by the prosecution in their submissions, when Koh was asked to compare his own signatures in the work record cards in Exhibits P13 and P14, which were also appended in October 2012, he realised that some of his signatures therein also differed slightly in length and width. As such, while Koh maintained that his signature in Exhibit P1 was “slightly different”, he confirmed that he had signed the sketch plan. Koh explained that his initial confusion was due to the events being “so long ago” and he had difficulty remembering what he had signed on.[^95] Having studied Koh’s evidence carefully, I found that Koh’s initial reluctance to confirm that he had signed Exhibit P1stemmed from what he perceived as slight differences in the signature therein. However, the objective evidence in Exhibits P13 and P14 demonstrated that Koh’s signature, at the material time, had the tendency to differ slightly from one another. Thus, instead of casting doubt on the veracity of Koh’s evidence, this demonstrated his forthright and unbiased approach when testifying in Court, and buttressed his overall credibility as a witness.

105    In assessing Koh’s credibility, I further took into account the fact that having pleaded guilty to the charges against him and served his sentence, there was little (if any) reason for him to lie or exaggerate his evidence, much less to falsely implicate an innocent man whom he had known for years and regarded as a friend. As for Cham, having been administered a warning for her role in the offences, she had nothing to gain by coming to Court to give false evidence against a man whom she hardly knew.

106    Based on the above, I found as a fact that the Accused had indeed approached Koh and Cham to pose as driver and passenger respectively, in a staged accident involving a vehicle belonging to him, which he knew was not driven by Koh at the material time. This, in turn, clearly pointed to the Accused’s guilty knowledge that the accident was staged and also to his complicity in the attempt to cheat the insurance companies.

### Evidence of the other members of the scheme reinforced the prosecution’s case

107    The prosecution’s case was also reinforced by the evidence of other parties to the staged accident, which showed the Accused’s connivance in the scheme.

108    Firstly, the evidence showed that, as the owner and/or repairer of the purported first and second vehicles in a chain collision, the Accused clearly stood to benefit directly from the property damage claims in respect of both vehicles.

109    In addition, the evidence also pointed to the Accused’s determination to profit from the staged accident. The Accused claimed that he suffered losses of about $5,000 to $6,000 in effecting repairs to V2. As such, after he learnt that the accident was staged and he could not claim compensation from the insurers, he met the other parties involved in order to recover those losses.[^96] However, it was not disputed by the defence that at the meeting, Abdillah had offered to pay the Accused $5000 to settle the matter but was rejected by the Accused. It was also not disputed by the defence that Abdillah subsequently received a letter from debt collectors stating that they were instructed by MK Motors to demand a much larger “outstanding sum” of $23,102.53 owing to the latter (Exhibit 29).

110    Thirdly, while Shahriezad and Nazar gave different versions of how Shahriezad had obtained the vehicle registration numbers of V1 and V3, their evidence clearly indicated that, similar to Koh, Shahriezad had obtained the particulars of the other two vehicles involved in the accident after he attended at MK Motors and was told to lodge a Singapore Accident Statement. In my view, this dove-tailed the prosecution’s case that MK Motors was complicit in the staged accident scam.

### The claims as set out in the charges were submitted to the insurance companies pursuant to the conspiracy

111    I now turn to consider the evidence concerning the acts that took place pursuant to the conspiracy as set out in the respective charges.

112    One of the main thrusts of the defence’s submissions in this case was that the Accused should be acquitted of the 1st charge as MK Motors never issued a letter of demand for $17,930.20 to AXA in order to dishonestly induce AXA into delivering payment of the sum. The defence alleged that Exhibit P7 was merely an estimate for repairs prepared by MK Motors’ employees which was addressed to MK Automotive. Thus, there was no demand of payment or claim made to AXA.[^97]

113    Having carefully scrutinised the evidence, I agreed with the prosecution that this part of the defence’s case was not put to the prosecution’s witnesses. Ekhsan, a claims executive and in-house investigator with AXA gave unequivocal testimony that Exhibit P7 was submitted by MK Motors through AXA’s adjuster to AXA and the total amount claimed by MK Motors was $17,930.20. Not only did the defence fail to put their case on this point to contradict Ekhsan, the defence in fact did not even cross-examine him.

114    Next, I turned to look at what the Accused had to say about this issue. During examination-in-chief and cross-examination, the Accused had consistently taken the position that he had made a property damage claim to AXA with respect to V1. For example, when the Court sought to clarify as to when the Accused realised that V1 and V2 were involved in the same accident, the Accused testified that he had submitted insurance claims for both vehicles[^98]:

>   
| 

Court:

 | 

I'm not talking about staged accident. I'm just asking about when he realised that his own vehicle and his customer's vehicle were involved in the same accident.

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

A few months after---**after the submission for the insurance claim.**

 |
| 

**Court:**

 | 

**The claim was submitted by your company for both vehicles?**

 |
| 

**Witness:**

 | 

**Yes.**

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

So, you didn't realise that when you submit the claim, that your company is claiming for 2 vehicles involved in the same accident. Is that what you are trying to tell me?

 |
| 

Witness:

 | 

At that point in time when we submit the claim, I did not know that my car and Mr. Shahriezad's car was involved in the same accident.

 |
| 

(emphasis added)

 |

  
  

115    As highlighted by the prosecution in their submissions[^99], the Accused had also explicitly testified that Exhibit P7 was a document prepared by MK Motors and submitted for the purpose of insurance claims[^100]:

> Q    Now, P7 is the document which was prepared by MK Motors, your workshop, and submitted for the purpose of insurance claims, correct?

> A    Yes, and then there will be a surveyor who will come by and then make sure of things are in order, and then will process with it.

116    He was also aware that Exhibit P7 was submitted to the insurers.[^101]

117    In view of the above, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions that despite the use of the word “estimate” in Exhibit P7, it clearly represented the amount assessed by MK Motors to be the cost of repairs for V1 and hence, their quantification of the property damage claim against AXA.[^102] As with most if not all motor accident related claims, this claim would be subject to verification by the insurers _as well as_ negotiations between both parties. Thus, the fact that the final pay out may not be the sum initially claimed in Exhibit P7 would not detract from the fact that it was, in essence, a claim submitted by MK Motors on behalf of MK Automotive (the owner of V1) to AXA for the amount of $17,930.20. The fact that this claim was put up and submitted to AXA by MK Motors despite the Accused’s knowledge that the accident was staged, must surely mean that this was done with the intention to dishonestly induce AXA into delivering payment.

118    Another key element of the defence’s case was that the Accused had nothing to do with Koh and Cham’s personal injury claims as set out in the 2nd to 5th charges as they had instructed K. Krishna & Partners on their own accord. The defence submitted that this was supported by Koh’s evidence that the Accused was only interested in his vehicle repairs.[^103] In my view, this argument flew in the face of the clear and consistent evidence given by both Koh and Cham that the Accused was the driving force behind their personal injury claims. Both Koh and Cham testified that:

> (a)     it was the Accused who instructed each of them to see a doctor and obtain a medical certificate;

> (b)     they had handed the medical certificates and receipts issued by the doctors to the Accused;

> (c)     they did not instruct lawyers to act for them;

> (d)     they had signed the Warrants to Act in Exhibits P4 and P19 respectively based on the instructions or advice of the Accused or someone at MK Motors; and

> (e)     it was the Accused who engaged the lawyers, and the lawyers were acting upon his instructions.

119    In fact, it was the Accused who had given contradictory versions in this regard. In his testimony during the trial, the Accused had insisted that he was not involved in Koh or Cham appointing lawyers for their personal injury claims as Koh did not inform the Accused that he had suffered any injuries during the accident or that Cham was a passenger in V1. Thus, it was interesting to note that the Accused had stated a different version in his statement in Exhibit P39, that he was the one who prepared the Warrants to Act for Koh _and_ Cham:

> Q6.    Did you pass Koh a piece of paper with the title “Warrant-to-Act” for me \[sic\] to sign? In the paper were Koh’s particulars and my \[sic\] address, when Koh then asked you as to what is this paper for, you then told me \[sic\] him as he had encountered an “accident”, he (Koh) need to sign on this paper so that you can get a lawyer to help him claim for insurance. Thereafter, you then asked Koh for his NRIC Card and his driver licence so that you can help me \[sic\] process for the insurance claims.

> A6.    Yes. I did as I believed that he had encountered a real traffic accident. **I prepared the Warrant-To-Act for him and his wife as he told me that he and his wife had encountered a traffic accident.** I then collected his NRIC and driving licence to be photocopied for claiming of the damages to the vehicle.

> (emphasis added)

120    In my view, the Accused’s assertion that he was not involved in Koh and Cham’s personal injury claims lacked credibility and was part of his attempt to dissociate himself from the conspiracy. As such, I rejected his version and found as a fact that the respective claims, as set out in the 2nd to 5th charges were issued to AXA and CTI respectively pursuant to the conspiracy to cheat.

## Conclusion

121    In conclusion, having carefully scrutinised the totality of the evidence, I was satisfied that the prosecution has proven the five proceeded charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the same.

## The Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

122    Section 420 of the Penal Code provided for mandatory imprisonment which may extend to 10 years. The offender would also be liable to a fine.

123    In addition, section 116 of the Penal Code (as at the date of the offences) stated:

> “Whoever abets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to **one-fourth of the longest term provided for that offence**, or with such fine as is provided for that offence, or with both; …”

> (emphasis added)

124    As such, the maximum imprisonment term that the Accused was liable for, per charge, was 2½ years.

### Antecedents

125    The Accused had the following antecedents for similar offences:

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

126    The prosecution tendered written submissions on sentence (“PSS”) as well as a bundle of authorities (“PSS-BOA”), and supplemented these with oral submissions in Court.

127    The prosecution sought a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment and submitted various factors in support of its sentencing position.

128    Firstly, the prosecution argued that the pre-dominant sentencing principle in motor insurance fraud cases was general deterrence. This was because motor insurance fraud affected the delivery of financial services (i.e. the provision and underwriting of motor insurance) by insurance companies, which were financial institutions. As such, the failure to stem the tide of such offences would threaten Singapore’s stand as an international financial and commercial hub. In light of Singapore’s compulsory third-party insurance regime, as well as statistics which showed that the motor insurance industry suffered staggering losses due to fraud, it was also in the public interest to deter such offences so as to keep the lid on increasing insurance premiums. The need for deterrence was even greater where the offences were syndicated, sophisticated, difficult to detect, and involved significant planning and orchestration.[^104]

129    Next, the prosecution highlighted various factors in this case which supported the imposition of a deterrent sentence:

> (a)     The Accused occupied the top level in the syndicate as he supplied V1 for use in the staged accident and recruited Koh and Cham into the conspiracy. He was also instrumental in moving the claims along and took steps to conceal his involvement. The Accused was himself involved in the motor workshop industry and had made use of his position as someone in the business of repairing vehicles and who was familiar with making such property damage and personal injury claims, to defraud the insurers. This heightened his culpability.[^105]

> (b)     The Accused’s attempt to tamper with witnesses such as Koh and Abdillah must be viewed even more severely in the context of motor insurance fraud, as often, the only means of detection was when participants came forward to confess.[^106]

> (c)     The Accused’s fanciful defence at trial was a complete fabrication which indicated his utter lack of remorse for his role in the offences. This was an aggravating factor.[^107]

> (d)     The Accused was motivated by financial gain. While no loss was occasioned as a result of the Accused’s involvement in the conspiracy, this was not attributable to the Accused’s conduct and was not mitigating in any way. The amount of loss ($39,004.60) which could have resulted remained an important factor to be considered in determining the severity of the sentence to be imposed. The Accused’s intention to personally benefit from the full amount of the fraudulent claims could be clearly inferred from his conduct in arranging a meeting with Shahriezad and Abdillah once he learnt that there were problems claiming for the damages to V2 against the insurers for V3.[^108]

130    The prosecution proceeded to set out the sentences imposed against the other accomplices involved in the staged accident. They may be summarised as follows:[^109]

131    The prosecution urged the Court to consider that the Accused’s role far exceeded any of the other accomplices above, and, as one the masterminds in the conspiracy, should be given a sentence more severe than those meted out to the lower-level accomplices. In addition, the only accomplice who faced charges that mirrored the Accused’s was Koh. However, in view of the Accused’s much higher culpability than Koh and the fact that Koh pleaded guilty and was untraced, the prosecution submitted that as a starting point, the individual sentences should be calibrated upwards significantly from those meted out to Koh.[^111]

132    Based on the above, the prosecution sought the following individual sentences against the Accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="34.6%"> <col width="34.94%"> <col width="30.46%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>(not paid out)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Individual Sentence sought</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922808-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">$17,930.20</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922809-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">$6,314.70</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922810-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">$6,314.70</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922811-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">$4,222.50</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922812-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="right" class="Table-Para-1">$4,222.50</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

133    Next, following the sentencing principles set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>, the prosecution urged the Court to run three of the sentences (namely those for DAC-922808-2018, DAC-922809-2018 and DAC-922812-2018) consecutively to achieve an aggregate sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that these three offences involved different insurance companies (i.e. AXA and CTI) and different types of claims (i.e. property damage and personal injury) made by different accomplices (i.e. Koh and Cham). As such, they involved invasion of separate legally protected interests. Conversely, not ordering three of the sentences to run consecutively would give an unwarranted discount to the Accused for different categories of claims against different insurers that he had wished to pursue. In any event, pursuant to section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, at least two sentences would have to run consecutively, and the prosecution was only seeking that the Court order an additional imprisonment term to run consecutively.[^112]

134    The prosecution further submitted that pursuant to the totality principle, having a last look at the facts and circumstances of this case, the overall sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment was proportionate to the Accused’s overall criminality and there was no reason to adjust the individual sentences downwards.[^113]

135    Finally, the prosecution submitted a table of sentences meted out in other mastermind cases for comparison and argued that the global sentence sought against the Accused was fair. In particular the prosecution highlighted the case of _PP v Mohamed Eunos Bin Zakaria_ (DAC-902634-2014 & Ors – unreported) where the accused person was convicted after trial of four charges under section 420 read with section 109 of the Penal Code and two charges under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code which involved a total claim amount of $57,132 of which $25,232 was paid out. For the charges under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code, he was sentenced as follows:

> (a)     15 month’s imprisonment where the claim of $25,245 was not paid out; and

> (b)     8 months’ imprisonment where the claim of $6,655 was not paid out.

136    In that case, sentences in three charges were ordered to run consecutively resulting in a global sentence of 38 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution submitted that the current case justified a higher deterrent aggregate sentence as the Accused was the owner of a motor vehicle workshop and a message needed to be sent that should such persons choose to use their workshops as “full-service fraud offices and act as professional enablers of scams on insurers, they will be dealt with severely”. [^114]

137    In the case of _PP v Su Chia Ern_ (DAC-92956-2014 & Ors -- unreported) the accused person was also the main operator of a repair workshop. The case involved a total claim of $380,259.75 of which $175,663.56 was paid out. A global sentence of 40 months’ imprisonment was imposed. The prosecution submitted that the accused person in that case was untraced and had pleaded guilty and was thus afforded a significant discount in terms of sentencing. In contrast the Accused had shown an utter lack of remorse and even tried to interfere with Koh and Abdillah during the course of investigations.[^115]

138    In their oral submissions, the prosecution also highlighted the recent case of _PP v Tang Jui Peng_ (DAC-900850-2020 & Ors – unreported), which was first brought to the Court’s attention by the defence. The prosecution submitted that in _Tang_’s case, which involved a mastermind who pleaded guilty, sentences between 9 to 16 months’ imprisonment were meted out for charges under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code involving claims in the region of $7,000 to $17,000 which were not paid out.[^116]

### Mitigation & Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

139    The defence submitted orally on mitigation and sentence. Firstly, the defence argued that _PP v Tang Jui Peng_ was not relevant except for one charge. Further, the sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment was meted out in that case in relation to offences involving innocent or unsuspecting third parties. In support, the defence drew the Court’s attention to the facts in relation to the 33rd change (DAC 900880-2020), 43rd charge (DAC 900899-2020) and 50th charge (DAC 900919-2020) in that case.[^117]

140    The defence next referred to the case of _PP v Tijan Syafiq Bin Selamat_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGDC 198</span> at \[32\] where sentences of 8 months’ and 6 months’ imprisonment were meted out in relation to charges under section 420 read with section 109 involving claims of $15,165.82 and $4559.40 respectively.[^118]

141    Turning to the facts of the current case, the defence submitted that the Accused’s role in the conspiracy was that his car was involved, and he asked Koh to make an accident statement and get Cham involved as a passenger. As such, the role played by the Accused could not be that of a “big mastermind” and those who recruited the other cars and drivers were actually the main participants of the offence. In addition, the defence’s position was that the Accused “chickened out” halfway and did not submit any claim. As such the sentence meted out to the Accused could not be an uplift of close to three times from that meted out to Koh. Therefore, for the 1st charge (DAC-922808-2018), the defence submitted that the sentence should not be anything more than 10 months’ imprisonment.[^119]

142    The defence further submitted that there was no evidence that the Accused asked Koh to make a personal injury claim or that he brought Koh and Cham to the law firm to make such claims. As such, the level of wrongdoing by the Accused, if any, was very low. As Koh was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment for the offence concerning the personal injury claim, for the 2nd charge (DAC-922809-2018), the defence submitted that the Accused should be sentenced to no more than 4 months’ imprisonment.[^120]

143    Finally, the defence highlighted that all the charges in this case related to one accident and thus arose out of one single transaction. As such the total sentence submitted by the prosecution was much too high. This was especially so if a comparison were made with the sentencing precedents involving masterminds highlighted by the prosecution, including _PP v Tang Jui Peng_ where the accused person faced a total of 53 charges, the total claim exceeded $300,000 and the total amount paid out was about $95,000. The global sentence in that case was 51 months’ imprisonment.[^121]

### Prosecution’s reply

144    In response, the prosecution pointed out that the majority of the precedents highlighted by the defence during their submissions were plead-guilty cases, save for _PP v Ong Ka Li_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 330</span> and _PP v Mohamed Eunos bin Zakaria_.

145    The prosecution also submitted that the defence had downplayed the Accused’s role in their submissions. The evidence led during the trial indicated that apart from interacting with Koh and Cham, the Accused also interacted with Shahriezad as well as Abdillah, who were the other named drivers in the accident. There were also planning and premeditation involved on the part of the Accused.

146    In addition, even though claims in this case were based on a single staged accident, they involved different victims, persons recruited, and different interests protected. As such, the prosecution urged the court to characterise each of the transactions as separate.

### Sentencing considerations

147    In considering the appropriate sentence in this case, I agreed with prosecution’s submissions that the primary sentencing principle applicable to cases involving motor insurance fraud would be that of general deterrence: _PP v Lau Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[24(e)\].[^122] The need for general deterrence would be further heightened in cases involving group or syndicated offending, as well as in cases involving offences which were difficult to detect or apprehend: _PP v Lau Aik Meng_ at \[25(d) and (e)\]. In this instance, the evidence showed that the staged accident was the work of a syndicate. It was orchestrated and executed by a network of ring-leaders, recruiters and participants. As pointed out by the prosecution in their submissions, such illicit enterprises were difficult to detect and, in my view, it would be even more difficult to apprehend those at the top end of the hierarchy.

148    Further, in sentencing for financial and property offences, the general principle was that greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence: _Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span>_ at \[42\]. This was because the economic value would reflect the harm (or potential harm) that would be suffered by the victim(s). In the present case, I noted that the total value of the claims made to AIA and CTI was $39,004.60. At the same time, I was mindful that the personal injury claims were, in a sense, duplicated, as the same claims for Koh and Cham were made separately to the insurers of the two alleged tortfeasers in V2 and V3.

149    I also considered the Accused’s level of culpability, and noted the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     The Accused had committed the offences for personal gain. As observed earlier in these grounds, the Accused was the owner and repairer of V1. He therefore stood to profit directly from any payment made by the insurer for the fraudulent property damage claim in relation to V1. The Accused was also the one who facilitated the making of false personal injury claims in Koh and Cham’s names. It was therefore highly likely that the Accused would benefit from any compensation paid. In addition to the claims mentioned in the charges against the Accused, the evidence led at trial showed that as the repairer of V2, the Accused had engaged lawyers for Shahriezad to pursue the fraudulent property damage claim in relation to V2. It was therefore clear that the Accused also stood to gain from any damages paid. In this connection, I agreed with the prosecution that the fact that no loss was occasioned in this case was not attributable to the Accused’s conduct, but instead, to the vigilance on the part of the insurers.

> (b)     The Accused was one of the masterminds who played an extensive and integral role in the scheme:

>> (i)       His vehicle, V1, was used in the staged accident;

>> (ii)       He had recruited Koh and Cham as phantom driver and passenger in V1;

>> (iii)       He facilitated the property damage claim as well as personal injury claims in relation to V1;

>> (iv)       His workshop (MK Motors) were the repairers for V2; and

>> (v)       He facilitated Shahriezad’s property damage claim in relation to V2.

> (c)     As highlighted by the prosecution, as a stakeholder in the Singapore motor vehicle repairs industry, the Accused had abused his position by employing his knowhow and used his businesses as conduits to perpetuate fraud against the insurers.

> (d)     The Accused had attempted to tamper with a key witness during the course of investigations by asking Koh to lie to the investigating officer that he had rented V1 from the Accused.

150    I should add that in considering the aggravating factors in this case, I had placed little weight on the Accused’s antecedents as they were very much dated.

151    With regard to the prosecution’s argument that the accused ran a fanciful defence at trial, I recognised that the Accused had the right to claim trial and should not be penalised just for doing so. Even though the Accused’s defence was eventually found to be untrue, the conduct of his defence at trial was not so egregious as to amount to an aggravating factor.

152    However, the Accused’s decision to claim trial clearly showed that he was not at all remorseful for the offences. I took this into consideration as a relevant factor which militated against the Accused.,

153    For the purpose of sentencing parity, in deliberating sentence in this case, I also had regard to the individual and global sentences meted out against the other co-accused persons, and in particular, those against Koh. That said, I could not agree with the defence’s submissions that the Accused’s sentences should be arrived at by making slight upward adjustments to Koh’s sentences. This was because of the vastly different levels of culpability on the part of Koh and the Accused. Furthermore, while Koh had pleaded guilty to two charges, the Accused had been convicted after trial on five charges. As such. the Accused could not expect to be given any discount on sentence which was usually accorded to accused persons who pleaded guilty as a sign of their remorse.

154    It was also pertinent to consider the sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution in relation to masterminds, including the recent case of _PP v Tang Jui Peng_.[^123] The table below summarises the sentences meted out in the sentencing precedents for charges under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code, where the offences were inchoate:

155    From the above, it could be seen that in cases where the accused persons had _pleaded guilty_, the sentences for individual charges under section 420 read with section 116 of the Penal Code involving claims of approximately $4,000 to $7,000 ranged between 6 to 9 months, while those involving claims of about $14,000 to $17,000 ranged from 10 to 16 months.

156    Taking the above into consideration, at this stage of the analysis, I was in broad agreement with the prosecution that the individual sentences in this case should be in the region of 16 months’ imprisonment for the 1st charge and about 8 to 10 months for the 2nd to 5th charges.

157    I had also considered the defence’s submission that the one-transaction rule applied as the various claims arose out of one staged accident. Having carefully reviewed the parties’ submissions on this issue, I agreed with the prosecution that the one-transaction rule would not be engaged in this case. This was because the offences involved different natures of claim, victims and co-conspirators and were not proximate in time (the acts done pursuant to the conspiracy occurred on various dates between 16 October 2012 and 23 January 2014). Thus, the various offences in this case did not involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest.[^124] Further, even if I were wrong and all the offences could be considered to have arisen from one transaction, the one-transaction rule would still have limited scope in this case, as pursuant to section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, at least two sentences of imprisonment must be ordered to run consecutively. Most importantly, as pointed out by the High Court in _Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ at \[27\] and \[45\], the one-transaction rule was not an inflexible or rigid rule, and the Court may, in appropriate instances, deviate from it. In this case, I was of the view that it would be necessary to deviate from the one-transaction rule in order to give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence. Doing so would also be in keeping with the gravity of the offences committed by the Accused. Thus, I agreed with the prosecution that three of the sentences of imprisonment ought to run consecutively.

158    Next, applying the totality principle (_Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ at \[47\] to \[66\]), I was of the view that the global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment proposed by the prosecution would be substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. As such, I re-calibrated the individual sentences downwards to ensure that the global sentence would be proportionate to the Accused’s criminality and not result in a crushing sentence.

### Decision on Sentence

159    Having considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, I sentenced the Accused as follows on the individual charges:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="39.06%"> <col width="60.94%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922808-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>14 months’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922809-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>7 months’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922810-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922811-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-922812-2018</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>6 months’ imprisonment</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

160    I further ordered that the sentences of imprisonment in DAC-922808-2018, DAC-922809-2018 and DAC-922812-2018 to run consecutively. In my view, the total sentence of 27 months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in this case.
