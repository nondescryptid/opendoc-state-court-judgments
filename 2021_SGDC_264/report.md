Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Statutory Offences – Road Traffic Act

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9259/2021/01.\]

23 November 2021

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Chuah Choon Yee, a 41 years-old male Singapore citizen had pleaded guilty to the following charge:

Charge

> are charged that you on 24 July 2020 at 9.28a.m., along Selegie Road towards the direction of Serangoon Road, Singapore, did drive a motor vehicle SKX7268S on a road without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, to wit, by failing to give way to a pedestrian when you were making the discretionary right turn into Sungei Road towards the direction of Ophir Road and subsequently collided onto the said victim who was crossing the pedestrian crossing from your right to left, and the pedestrian crossing was showing ‘green man’ at the material time and grievous hurt was caused to the pedestrian Teo Seok Noi, a Singaporean female Chinese, age 77 years old, by such driving and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 65(1)(b) punishable under Section 65(3)(a) read with Section 65(6)(d) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).

2       On 10 November 2021, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. After carefully considering the accused’s oral plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, I sentenced the accused to six weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of five years with effect from the date of his release. As the accused sought a deferment of his sentence for two days for him to settle his personal matters, I ordered his sentence to commence on 12 November 2021.

3       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence and order of disqualification on 11 November 2021. He is on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

4       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Statement Facts

5       The Statement of Facts which the accused had admitted to without qualification is as follows:

> Involved Parties

> 1    The accused is Chuah Choon Yee, a Singaporean male Chinese, age 41 years old. He was the driver of motor car, SKX7268S, at the time of the accident.

> 2    The victim is Teo Seok Noi, a Singaporean female Chinese, age 77 years old. She was the pedestrian at the time of the accident.

> 3    The witness is Swaminathan Sekar, a Singaporean male, age 37 years old. He was the pedestrian at the time of the accident.

> First Information Report

> 4    On 24 July 2020 at 9.28a.m., Police received a call with text of message “Car hit a pedestrian. He is injured.” The location report was along Selegie Road junction Sungei Road. The caller is the witness.

> Facts of the Case

> 5    On 24 July 2020 at 9.28a.m., the accused was driving a motor car, SKX7268S on lane 1 of a 5 lanes road along Selegie Road towards the direction of Serangoon Road, Singapore, without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, by failing to give way to the victim when the accused was making a discretionary right turn into Sungei Road towards the direction of Ophir Road and subsequently collided onto the said victim who was crossing the pedestrian crossing from the accused right to left on traffic green man signal, and grievous hurt was caused to the victim by such driving.

> 6    Footage obtained from accused in-car camera revealed that the accused was stationary on lane 1 of a 5 lanes road along Selegie Road junction Sungei Road. The accused was the first vehicle. The victim was seen standing at the pedestrian crossing on the accused’s right side. Subsequently, the accused proceeded to make a right turn as the traffic light was showing green for the accused. While the accused was making the right turn onto Sungei Road towards Ophir, the accused collided onto the victim who was crossing the pedestrian crossing on ‘green man’ from the accused right to left.

> 7    The witness was crossing the pedestrian crossing nearby when the witness heard a loud sound and saw accused’s motor car at the pedestrian crossing and the pedestrian crossing was showing ‘green man’.

> Injuries

> 8    The victim was conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The victim’s medical report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 26 April 2021 states the victim suffered traumatic subdural hemorrhage, open fracture on left ankle and close fracture of right foot 5th metatarsal base. The victim underwent surgery (debridement and external fixation) of left ankle on 26 July 2020. She also underwent a staged definitive fixation (removal of external fixator and open reduction and internal fixation of her left ankle with syndesmosis repair) on 5 August 2020. The victim was discharged from TTSH on 12 August 2020 to Ren Ci Hospital. The victim was reviewed in TTSH on 25 September 2020, 23 October 2020, 20 November 2020 and 26 February 2021. On the last visit, the victim was able to ambulate independently. The victim was given total of 164 days of hospitalization leave until 11 March 2021.

> 9    The victim medical report from Ren Ci Hospital dated 21 April 2021 revealed that the victim was transferred to Ren Ci Hospital on 12 August 2021 for slow stream rehabilitation. The victim was discharged on 8 September 2020 \[46 days warded\] and her function had improved significantly. The victim was also independent in her feeding, grooming and wheelchair mobility. The victim required minimal assistance on her dressing, showering and toileting.

> Damages

> 10    Motorcar, SKX7268S right front bumper sustained cracks and scratches. Prevailing Conditions

> 11    At the time of accident, weather was clear, road surface was dry and the visibility was good. The traffic flow was heavy.

> Conclusion

> 12    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence of Inconsiderate driving causing grievous hurt under Section 65(1)(b) Chapter 276 punishable under Section 65(3)(a) read with Section 65(6)(d) of the said Act

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalty

6       The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 65(1)(_b_) and punishable ss 65(3)(_a_) read with 65(6)(_d_) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) is fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. In addition, the offender is liable to a mandatory disqualification order for all classes of vehicles for at least five years.

## Antecedents

7       The accused did not have any similar antecedents.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

8       The Prosecution had submitted that the accused’s culpability was low. The accused was making a discretionary right turn and victim had a right of way when she crossed the pedestrian crossing on green man.

9       As for the harm, it was highlighted that the victim had suffered a closed fracture of her ankle and she underwent medical procedures. She was warded for 19 days at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and 34 days of hospitalisation leave was given before she was transferred to Ren Ci Hospital for further rehabilitation. She was hospitalised for another 46 days before being discharged. It was submitted that the harm in this case was on the higher end of moderate harm. The total hospitalisation leave for this case of 164 days was long and for a substantial period. There was also surgical intervention for the victim. It was the Prosecution’s case that the custodial threshold had been crossed in this case. The Prosecution sought for a custodial sentence between four to six weeks’ imprisonment and five years disqualification mandatory period for the charge.

## Mitigation

10     In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused admitted that he was careless and that he was very sorry. He was remorseful. He was thankful that victim is well now. According to the accused he had not seen the victim at that moment. He asked for leniency as this was his first offence. He pleaded for a light sentence as well as a shorter period of disqualification. He also pleaded for leniency.

## Sentencing considerations

### S 65(1) of the RTA

11     S 65(1) of the RTA encapsulates the primary offence of driving without due care or reasonable consideration for other persons using the road. The subsequent subsections from ss 65(2) to 65(4) are the penalty prescribing provisions, each tiered according to the degree of hurt caused and for s 65(5), for any other case of non-personal injury or potential harm. The present offence under s 65(1) of the RTA was enacted on 1 November 2019, following the passing of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2019 (Act 19 of 2019). Presently, as at the date of my decision there is no existing sentencing framework enunciated by the High Court for offences under s 65(1), particularly one punishable under s 65_(3)_(a) of the RTA.

#### Sentencing approach

12     I am mindful that in _PP v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span>, (“_Cullen_”) the district judge in that case had proposed a sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 65(3)(_a_) of the RTA for offenders who claim trial. The appropriate adjustments are to be made for offenders who plead guilty by taking into consideration the offender-specific mitigating factors. In that case a sentence of ten weeks’ imprisonment and disqualification for all classes of vehicles for a period of five years with effect from date of release as well as a prohibition under s 47F RTA from driving any motor vehicle in Singapore for a period of five years with effect from date of release was imposed for the charge involving s 65(3)(_a_) of the RTA.

13     In that case, the offender, a British national was charged with two counts of driving without reasonable consideration under the s 65(1)(_b_) of the RTA together with one count of failing to stop after an accident under s 84(1)(_a_) read with s 84(7) of the RTA. This was in respect of two separate road traffic accidents which had occurred on the same day on 10 November 2019 within a span of about five minutes and not more than one kilometre apart. Damage was caused to the first victim’s motorcar for the first accident. For the second accident, the accused was liable to under s65(3)(_a_) of the RTA as serious damage was caused to the second victim’s motorcar and grievous hurt was caused to the second victim. He was hospitalised for three days and given 48 days of hospitalisation leave. The medical report indicated that the victim had sustained a fracture to his lumbar spine (L4 superior endplate acute fracture with mild anterior wedging of L4 due to mild depression in the anterior aspect of the superior endplate). He was treated conservatively for his lumbar spine injury with a lumbar corset.

14     As the offence under s 65(3)(_a_) of the RTA is for causing grievous hurt by careless or inconsiderate driving, the district judge was of the view that the two principal factual elements in the determination of the severity of this offence are:

> (a)     The level of culpability of the offender in his act of careless or inconsiderate driving; and

> (b)     The degree of grievous hurt caused by the offender due to his act of careless or inconsiderate driving.

#### Level of culpability

15     To determine the level of culpability, she had suggested a working or functional definition after having regard to the offence-specific factors for careless or inconsiderate driving.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="30.76%"> <col width="69.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Level of culpability</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Definition</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Generally, no dangerous driving behaviour exhibited.

#### Degree of harm

16     As for the degree of harm in terms of grievous hurt caused, factors like (i) nature, location and type of injury _eg_ fracture/dislocation of the bone; (ii) manner and type of treatment; (iii) duration of hospitalisation or medical leave; and (iv) long term effect of injury to victim’s daily living or permanent disabilities resulting from the injury can be taken into account. She proposed the following working or functional definition for each degree of harm caused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="30.76%"> <col width="69.24%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Degree of harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Definition</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Minor Injury</em>: Conservative treatment with no or short hospitalisation and/or short medical leave period.

17     She adapted the sentencing matrix approach as set out in _Logachew Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> (_“Logachev”_) to draw up the sentencing framework for offences punishable under s 65(3)(_a_) of the RTA. The five-steps are as follows:

> (a)     First step: Identify the level of harm and the level of culpability;

> (b)     Second step: Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range;

> (c)     Third step: Identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range;

> (d)     Fourth step: Make adjustments to the starting point to take into account offender-specific factors;

> (e)     Fifth step: Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

18     In respect of Step 2 at \[134\], after considering the relevant High Court cases as well as the tables for the proposed sentencing framework by both Prosecution and Defence, she suggested a sentencing framework in relation to the various extent of grievous hurt caused due to careless driving for an accused who claims trial as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="27.7144571085783%"> <col width="18.0563887222555%"> <col width="18.0763847230554%"> <col width="18.0763847230554%"> <col width="18.0763847230554%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="3" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em><u>CULPABILITY</u></em></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">GRIEVOUS HURT</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">S 65(3)(a) RTA</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Up to $5,000 OR Up to 2 years or Both</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Mandatory DQ: At least 5 years</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="b" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em><u>HARM</u></em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Medium</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Serious</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Very serious</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,500 to $5,000</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 3 months</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3 to 6 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 9 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Up to 3 months</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3 to 6 months</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 9 months</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">9 to 12 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>High</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3 to 6 months</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6 to 9 months</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">9 to 12 months</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 to 24 months</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     Due to the dearth of authorities with precedential value after the 2019 amendments to s 65(1) of the RTA, _Cullen_ is often cited by both the Prosecution and the Defence in their address on sentence for accident cases where grievous hurt is caused. Nevertheless, this court is not bound by that decision. Furthermore, I am mindful that as there was no appeal against this decision, there is no appellate determination on the appropriateness of the suggested sentencing framework.

20     I was mindful that with the sentencing matrix approach, a court first determines the severity of the offence based on the principal factual elements of the case that are closely related to (a) the culpability of the offender in carrying out the offence and (b) the harm resulting from the offender’s actions: see _Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[74\]. This approach sets out a matrix, with each cell featuring a different indicative starting point and range of sentences. Thereafter, the sentencing court will have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors other than the principal factual elements to determine the precise sentence: see _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> at \[33\].

21     Unlike an offence under s 67(1)(_b_) of the RTA where the starting points can be calibrated based on the level of alcohol as reflected in the sentencing framework in _Rafael Voltaire Alzate v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 224</span>, for an offence under s 65(1), there is no identifiable key determinant of a starting point sentence. This is because for an offence under s 65(1), there are different penalty-prescribing provision with each tiered according to the degree of hurt caused. The element of harm is thus less relevant as a differentiating factor in sentencing offenders with a particular penalty-prescribing provision such as s 65(3)(_a_) of the RTA.

22     I have encountered difficulties in situating a given case at an appropriate matrix using the _Cullen_ sentencing approach due to the lack of the range of outcomes on the harm axis. I also found the suggested working or functional definition for each degree of harm difficult to apply in practice. When an offender pleads guilty to an offence of driving without due care or reasonable consideration, it is usually not reflected in the Statement of Facts, an expert’s opinion specifying whether a fracture is minor or complex and whether the surgical procedures are minor or significant. The court is only able to take cognisance of the harm being caused to a vulnerable part of the body, the period of hospitalisation and the hospitalisation leave and whether there is any resulting permanent disability if such particulars are provided.

23     Under such circumstances to determine the appropriate sentence, in my view it would be more appropriate for the court to first consider the offence-specific factors to determine the appropriate sentencing band where the present offence should be situated. Such factors would include the following:

> (a)     The manner, the mode and the location by which the offence was committed _eg_ driving against the flow of traffic, high degree of carelessness;

> (b)     the level of potential harm _eg_ serious risk posed to other road users;

> (c)     the nature of the harm caused to the victim _eg_ both grievous hurt and property damage caused;

> (d)     the number of victims involved;

> (e)     the accused’s motivation for driving _eg_ he had been driving a passenger for hire or reward;

> (f)     the accused had failed to stop after the accident to evade arrest or to avoid apprehension.

#### Proposed sentencing bands

24     The range of sentence that can be imposed for the present offence is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. For an offence with a lower level of seriousness and with no offence- specific aggravating factors, the range of a fine between $1,000 to $5,000 and/or up to one month’s imprisonment and the minimum disqualification period of five years for all classes of vehicles can be considered.

25     For the next band involving a higher level of seriousness with more than one offence-specific aggravating factors, a range of between one month’s imprisonment and up to one year’s imprisonment and disqualification for a period of five to six years can be considered. The accused’s level of culpability would typically be in the medium range.

26     The final band would be reserved for the most serious case of causing grievous hurt by careless or inconsiderate driving where there are multiple aggravating factors and the offender’s level of culpability is high. For such cases, a range of between one year’s imprisonment and two years’ imprisonment and disqualification for a period of six to seven years would be appropriate.

#### Calibration of sentence

27     The next step would be for the court to calibrate the sentence after having regard to the offender-specific factors. The relevant factors would include offences that are taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, the presence of relevant antecedents and evidence showing a lack of remorse. Offender-specific mitigating factors include a clean record, an early plea of guilt, evidence of genuine remorse and an offender’s youth.

28     I now turn to the facts of the present case.

## My decision on sentence

## Offence-specific factors

#### Manner and mode of offence

29     In the present case, I had considered the fact that the offence was committed at a signalised pedestrian when the victim, an elderly and vulnerable 77-year-old pedestrian had started to cross Sungei Road when the traffic green man signal came on. Prior to the accident, the victim was standing at the pedestrian crossing on the accused’s right in the in-car video footage. The accident had occurred in at 9:28am in broad daylight when the weather was clear, the road surface dry and the visibility was good. The accused’s motor car was the first vehicle in lane 1 and it was initially stationary along Selegie Road. There was no obstruction to the accused’s view ahead of him and to his right where the victim was standing. The victim would have been visible to the accused had he kept a proper look out of his surroundings as any motorist should before moving off and when approaching a pedestrian crossing.

30     The offence was committed when the accused was making a discretionary right turn into Sungei Road as the traffic light was showing green for the accused. From the in-car camera footage, I observed that when the accident occurred, the victim had already started walking slowly from the accused’s right to left along the pedestrian crossing. As there was no obstruction ahead of him, the victim would have been clearly visible to the accused had he paid attention to what was ahead of him. I observed that there were no culpability increasing factors such as excessive speeding or deliberate dangerous driving in the present case. As such, there was a high degree of carelessness by the accused as he had proceeded to make the right turn although the pedestrian was already crossing and had the right way. This was not an instance where a pedestrian had suddenly dashed across the crossing when the light was not in his favour.

#### Serious potential harm

31     All motorists should stop and allow pedestrians to make their way safely across the crossing when the green man signal is on before driving across any pedestrian crossing. There was serious potential harm present in the case as the accident had occurred at 9:28am where there might be other pedestrians apart from the victim crossing Sungei Road. In the present case, it was undisputed that there was a witness was also crossing nearby when the impact of the accident was heard.

#### Nature of grievous hurt caused

32     In respect of the harm caused, I considered the fact that the victim is an elderly victim who suffered serious injuries namely a traumatic subdural hemorrhage, an open fracture on left ankle and closed fracture of right foot 5th metatarsal base. The traumatic subdural hemorrhage, a serious condition where blood collects between the skull and the surface of the brain was an injury at a vulnerable as well as vital part of her body. It was fortunate the injury did not cause any permanent damage or cause any impairments to her bodily functions.

33     The victim required surgery on her left ankle _ie_ debridement and external fixation of her left ankle. She also underwent a removal of external fixator and open reduction and internal fixation of her left ankle with syndesmosis repair. She was hospitalised for a lengthy period of 46 days and was given total of 164 days of hospitalization leave. She was sent to Ren Ci Hospital on 12 August 2020 for slow stream rehabilitation. It was fortuitous that by the time of her discharge on 8 September 2020, she was able to ambulate independently, there was no significant abnormalities and her fracture had healed.

34     Due to the seriousness of the offence as set out above, I was of the view the present case fell within the proposed second sentencing band of between one month’s imprisonment and up to one year’s imprisonment and disqualification for a period of five to six years. There were several offence-specific aggravating factors present in this case namely, the high degree of carelessness, the serious potential harm to other pedestrians and serious harm caused to the victim.

35     The next step was for me to calibrate the sentence after considering offender-specific factors. The accused had pleaded guilty at the first mention to a single charge and had unrelated antecedents. He was clearly remorseful for his actions and had admitted that he was careless.

36     The Prosecution had sought a sentence of between four to six weeks’ imprisonment and disqualification for a period of five years for all classes of vehicles. The accused had asked for the shortest sentence and a shorter period of disqualification.

37     Due to the seriousness of the offence and the presence of several offence-specific aggravating factors, I was of the view that the sentence should be calibrated slightly above the proposed starting point of one month. A slight uplift to six weeks’ imprisonment was justified in the circumstances. I also imposed the minimum disqualification period of five years with effect from the date of release as there were no special reasons before me not to make the order or to order a period less than the specified period of five years.
