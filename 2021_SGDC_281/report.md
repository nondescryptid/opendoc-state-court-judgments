2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the charge against Mr Tang to be made out. He was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $1200, in default 1 week’s imprisonment.

3       Mr Tang has since paid the fine but is now appealing against both his conviction and sentence.

## The Undisputed Facts

4       Mr Tang works as a part-time Grab driver. He conveys passengers and delivers goods. On the day of the incident, Mr Tang was the driver of the motor car bearing vehicle registration no. SLU7316R (“the motor car”). The motor car is registered as a private-hire motor car. The registered owner of the motor car is Hipoint Enterprise.[^1] Mr Tang co-owns this business with one other partner.[^2]

5       On 28 August 2020 at about 6.50 pm, Mr Tang drove the motor car along Kampong Bahru Road. He was alone at the time. Mr Tang brought the motor car to a stop at the left side of the road, alongside a row of shops. There were unbroken double yellow lines laid down on the road where Mr Tang had stopped. Mr Tang left the engine running and turned on the hazard lights before alighting from the motor car. He went into one of the shops to collect some goods.[^3] He picked up the goods, placed them in the motor car, and then went into the shop again to make some enquiries.[^4]

6       At about the same time, LTA parking warden, Mr Linkess Kumar s/o Venga Desan (“Mr Linkess”), rode into Kampong Bahru Road on his motorcycle. He was on his rounds performing patrol duty. He spotted the motor car stopped at the side of the road and checked on it. He found that it was unattended. Mr Linkess alighted from his motorcycle and switched on his Body Worn Camera (“BWC”) as he walked towards the motor car. He took two photographs of the motor car using his ‘EHT’, an electronic hand-held device used for his enforcement work.[^5]

7       Just as Mr Linkess snapped the photographs, Mr Tang arrived back at the car saying, “Hey, I’m moving. I’m moving now”. Mr Linkess explained that once he had taken the pictures, he is not able to cancel, and must proceed to issue the summons.[^6] Mr Linkess proceeded to key in the details into the EHT and categorised the incident as a parking offence. Mr Tang protested once again stating, “It was parked less than one minute something”. Mr Linkess replied that Mr Tang would need to take it up with LTA. Mr Tang was not satisfied with the response. He became unhappy with Mr Linkess and began to take a video of Mr Linkess and his motorcycle. Mr Linkess printed the parking offence notice and handed it to Mr Tang. Mr Linkess stated that it had been no more than one minute from the time he spotted the motor car to the time when Mr Tang arrived at the scene.[^7]

## The Issues

8       The issues before this Court are as follows:

> ■     _Can Mr Tang be said to fall within the exception contained in the definition of ‘park’ i.e. immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods, or luggage;_

> ■     _Can Mr Tang be said to fall outside the definition of ‘park’ as the motor car was stopped for less than one minute._

## The Prosecution’s case

9       The Prosecution argued that the offence of illegal parking had been proven on the facts of the case. Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules prohibits the parking of vehicles on any road where unbroken double yellow lines are laid down, from the point where such lines commence to the point where they end. The term “park” is defined in Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276, to mean bringing a motor vehicle to a stationary position and causing it to wait for any purpose other than that of immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods, or luggage.

10     The Prosecution submitted that Mr Tang is shown to have parked along the double yellow lines because he did not immediately pick up or set down persons, goods, or luggage. He had stopped his vehicle, gotten out and left to collect the goods, came back and put the goods in the vehicle, and then went back to the shop to clarify the order. He only returned to his vehicle after doing all of that.

11     The Prosecution highlighted the case of _Jagir Singh Touwana v PP_,[^8] where the former Chief Justice Yong Pung How, had convicted the accused person even though he had stopped his vehicle for a mere 30 seconds because there was no immediate pick up or drop off of passengers, goods or luggage. Similarly, in the present case, there was no immediate pick up or drop off of any passengers, goods or luggage.

12     The Prosecution concluded that Mr Tang being the driver of the motor car had parked the vehicle along the unbroken double yellow lines when no immediate pick up or drop off of passengers, goods or luggage had occurred and had therefore illegally parked the motor car.[^9]

## The Defence

13     Mr Tang argued that the case precedent by the former Chief Justice Yong Pung How merely confuses the issues in the present case and LTA ought not to be citing it.

14     Mr Tang submitted that under Rule 22(b), he was permitted to pick up and alight passengers or to drop off goods. However, LTA stated in its letter dated 5 January 2021 at paragraph 3, that it has to be done “_immediately_”. Mr Tang argued that the footage from Mr Linkess’ BWC showed that he had returned to his car within 30 seconds, and he was prepared to leave. Therefore, he cannot be said to have violated Rule 22(b).

15     Mr Tang added that he has been driving for 40 years and has read the Highway Code several times. The Highway Code states that the driver is allowed to pick up and alight passengers and also to “_pick up goods”_ at the double yellow lines. If there was no such provision, he would not have parked there. It would therefore be unfair to convict him of this offence. If parking at double yellow lines is truly not permitted, then LTA ought to change the highway code to state, “_No parking at double yellow lines_”. That will make it much clearer. Mr Tang urged the Court to acquit him.[^10]

## My Decision

16     The facts of this case were entirely undisputed. Mr Linkess’ evidence is corroborated by the photographs of the motor car which he had taken, and the footage from his BWC.[^11] All showed that the motor car was stopped on the double yellow lines when Mr. Tang was not inside the car or present in the vicinity of the car. He arrived a short while later.

17     Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules reads as follows:

18     Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act defines ‘park’ as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Interpretation</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2.</b>—(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">“park” means to bring a motor vehicle or a trailer to a stationary position and cause it to wait for any purpose other than that of immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods or luggage;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

19     Rule 22(b) states that a vehicle is prohibited from parking on unbroken double yellow lines. Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act defines ‘park’ as bringing a vehicle to a stationary position to wait for any reason other than to immediately take up or to set down persons, goods or luggage.

### Immediately taking up or setting down goods

20     Mr. Tang repeatedly submitted that he had brought his vehicle to a stop or parked his vehicle for the purpose of immediately picking up of goods. This is permitted under Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act, which according to Mr Tang, allows a vehicle to be stopped to immediately pick up or take delivery of goods. I am unable to agree with Mr Tang’s submissions. It appears that Mr Tang had misinterpreted or misunderstood the purport of Section 2.

21     Mr. Tang had done quite a few things after he stopped the motor car. He stepped out of his vehicle, took delivery of goods, brought the goods back and placed them in the car, which by Mr. Tang’s assessment took about 30 seconds. Thereafter, he went back into the shop to seek clarification on the delivery, which again according to the footage and Mr. Tang’s account took about a further 30 seconds. I find that this sequence or series of activities cannot be said to fall within what is defined as _immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods or luggage_. What is clearly contemplated by the exception in Section 2 is the alighting or picking up of passengers or goods or luggage before or after their conveyance in the motor vehicle. Stopping the motor vehicle along the double yellow lines, and then to leave the vehicle unattended to take delivery of goods as Mr Tang did, does not fall within the saving clause in the definition of “park”. He has therefore contravened Rule 22(b).

### Defence of stopped briefly only is unsupportable

22     Mr. Tang had also repeatedly asked in Court what is meant by the term, “_immediately_”, as seen in Section 2 of the Road Traffic Act. He argued that he had stopped the motor car for less than one minute, and that should fall within the meaning of, “_immediately_”.

23     Again, I have to disagree with Mr Tang. I find that Mr. Tang in leaving the motor car unattended to go off to pick up the goods and then making a second trip to seek clarification, does not fall within what is considered as “_immediately”_.

24     It is clear that the saving provision in Section 2 is very narrowly interpreted. In _Jagir Singh Touwana v PP_, Chief Justice Yong Pung How held that a vehicle that was stopped for 30 seconds only along unbroken double yellow lines, for a purpose other than to pick up or alight passengers or to set down or take up goods, had no lawful excuse to have parked at the side of the road and has therefore contravened Rule 22(b). CJ Yong further remarked that the parking warden had no obligation to give the appellant a chance to move away before taking down his particulars.[^12]

25     Mr. Tang objected to the Prosecution citing this case. He said that it confused the issues at this trial. I failed to understand Mr Tang’s objections. There was nothing confusing about the case and it is certainly a relevant precedent. It is customary for the trial court to place reliance on past decisions of an appellate court to take guidance on the interpretation and the application of legislative provisions. They remain good precedents until they are overruled or set aside. The case of _Jagir Singh Touwana v PP_ has not been overruled and I agree with the Prosecution that it is appropriate to rely on this case.

26     I therefore find that the saving clause in Section 2 does not assist Mr. Tang. He had parked the motor car along the unbroken double yellow lines without lawful excuse. He has therefore contravened Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules. I find Mr. Tang guilty and convict him on the charge.

### Appropriate sentence

27     Mr Tang has two previous similar convictions. On 10 October 2019, he was convicted on two counts for the offence under Rule 22(b) of the Road Traffic Rules. He was fined $800 for each charge making a total of $1,600. The fines were paid in full. For the present offence, committed within a year of his previous conviction, I was of the view that it merited an uplift in the sentence. I imposed a fine of $1,200, in default one week’s imprisonment. Mr Tang has paid the fine in full.

## Conclusion

28     At the close of the trial, I was satisfied that the had Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. It is clear that the Defendant had violated Rule 22(b), which was evidently instituted to prevent motor vehicles from cluttering and clogging up the sides of the roads however briefly. Not only would the flow of traffic be impeded, but accidents may also occur from the obstruction caused.
