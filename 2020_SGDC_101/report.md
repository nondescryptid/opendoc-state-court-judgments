\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9040/2020/01-02.\]

17 April 2020

### District Judge John Ng:

The Offender pleaded guilty to 3 charges of Sexual Penetration of a Minor under 14 years of age punishable under Section 376A(3) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. He also admitted to 8 other charges of various offences under the Penal Code, the Children and Young Persons Act, Chapter 38 and the Films Act, Chapter 107, to be taken into consideration for sentence. He was sentenced to a total of 24 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution had sought for a global sentence of at least 33 months.

## Three Charges

2       The Offender pleaded guilty to the following 3 charges:

> DAC 926957/2018,

> “You are charged that you, on 25 April 2017, at xxx, Singapore, did penetrate with your finger, the vagina of one xxx, a girl under 14 years of age (born on xxx), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(b) and punishable under Section 376A(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> DAC 926960/2018,

> “You are charged that you, on 29 April 2017, at xxx, Singapore, did penetrate with your penis, the mouth of one xxx, a girl under 14 years of age (born on xxx), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(a) and punishable under Section 376A(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

> DAC 926962/2018,

> “You are charged that you, on 5 May 2017, at xxx, Singapore, did penetrate with your penis, the vagina of one xxx, a girl under 14 years of age (born on xxx), and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376A(1)(a) and punishable under Section 376A(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).”

## Summary of Facts

3       A Statement of Facts (“SOF”) pertaining to the above proceeded charges was admitted by the Offender without qualification. The salient facts are as follows:

> Background

> ·    The victim was a student at a local secondary school and at the material time of the offences, she was 13 years old and in Secondary 2.

> ·    The Offender was a university student and at the material time, he was 22 years old.

> ·    The victim and the Offender were alumni of a primary school band. The victim returned to her _alma mater_ once or twice a week to help with the band. During one of these sessions in early April 2017, she was introduced to the Offender by a fellow student. The Offender was also from the band previously and was there to help out. The Offender told the victim that he was a student at a local university. The victim in turn informed him that she was a Secondary 2 student. After the session ended, the victim, the Offender and their mutual friend made their way to the bus-stop. Along the way, the Offender and the victim exchanged handphone numbers.

> ·    A few days before 25 April 2017, via Instagram, the Offender contacted the victim for the first time. In the course of their chats, the Offender informed the victim that he had exchanged nude photos with other girls and asked to do the same with her. He asked her to download “Telegram”, a chatting application. He forwarded a photograph of his erect penis to the victim and asked her to reciprocate with a nude photograph of herself and she complied with the request. In the course of their conversations, they talked about sex and he spoke about his sexual experiences to her. They agreed to meet on 25 April 2017.

> DAC 926957/2018

> ·    In the afternoon of 25 April 2017, the victim made her way to a bus-stop after school to meet the Offender. He brought her back to his home and into his room where they sat on the bed and chatted. They kissed and undressed themselves. While both of them were naked on the bed, the Offender began rubbing the victim’s vagina and penetrated her vagina with his finger. He began moving his finger in and out of her vagina and inserted a second finger after a while. The victim also fellated the Offender on this occasion after some persuasion by him. By penetrating the victim’s vagina with his finger, the Offender had committed the offence of Sexual Penetration of a Minor under 14 years of age on this day.

> DAC 926960/2018

> ·    After the meeting on 25 April 2017, they continued to stay in touch by messaging each other. On 29 April 2017, in the afternoon, the Offender invited the victim to spend time with him at his university hostel room. The victim made her way to the hostel. Whilst at the hostel room, they were watching the movie ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ and when the sex scene in the movie started, they kissed each other. They undressed themselves and he began rubbing the victim’s vagina area before digitally penetrating her vagina. The victim also masturbated the accused. Shortly thereafter, he penetrated the victim’s mouth with his penis and moved his penis in and out of her mouth. After this, both parties cleaned themselves up and chatted for a while in his room before going their separate ways. By penetrating the victim’s mouth with his penis, the Offender had committed the offence of Sexual Penetration of a Minor under 14 years of age on that day.

> DAC 926962/2018

> ·    They continued to chat with each other over WhatsApp for the next few days while the victim was at a school camp. They arranged to meet at his home again once the victim ended her camp. On 5 May 2017, in the afternoon, the victim made her way to a mall near his home where she met the Offender. After purchasing some groceries, they went back to his home and had their lunch in his room, after which he asked the victim to massage him. The victim agreed. The accused removed all of his clothes except his underwear. The victim started massaging the accused’s back.

> ·    Shortly thereafter, the Offender turned the victim and with her on the bed, he went on top of her and started to kiss her. They undressed themselves completely and he began digitally penetrating the victim’s vagina. After doing so for a while, he asked the victim whether he could insert his penis into her vagina. The victim reminded him that she was still a virgin and was not comfortable with having sexual intercourse at that point. The victim eventually relented. The Offender then penetrated the victim’s vagina with his penis, without a condom. However, shortly thereafter, the victim asked him to stop as she was in pain because of the intercourse. He stopped and on his request, the victim masturbated and fellated him. By penetrating the victim’s vagina with his penis, the Offender had committed the offence of Sexual Penetration of a Minor under 14 years of age on that day.

> Discovery of the Offences

> ·    After the encounter on 5 May 2017, the Offender told the victim that he was going to start working as a relief teacher at her secondary school. After the Offender started working at the school and began teaching the victim’s class, the victim confided in her friends that she had had sex with him and that she regretted it.

> ·    Sometime in early 2017, the victim’s Form Teacher approached and asked the victim if there was something going on between her and the Offender. She then confided in her and the victim’s parents were informed.

> ·    After the police report was lodged, the Head of Department and the School Principal confronted the Offender. He denied the allegations. He was suspended as a relief teacher for the school and did not return thereafter. He deactivated his Instagram account and deleted all of the chats and photographs with the victim, as he did not want to risk them being circulated on the internet. The Offender subsequently admitted to the offences in the course of investigations.

## Oral Grounds for the Sentence

4       I took time to consider the sentence to be passed. On the day of sentencing, I spelt out the main reasons for my decision in the Oral Grounds. A copy of the Oral Grounds is found in the Annex. The essential points for the sentence passed are contained in the Oral Grounds and I do not wish to repeat them. Instead, I will provide elaboration on a few points in respect of the key contentious submissions presented by both sides.

## Detailed Reasons on Key Points of Contention

5       The Offender had no criminal records. At the time of the commission of the offences in the months of April and May 2017, he was 22 years old and an undergraduate at a local university. He is expected to graduate in the middle of 2020.

6       After giving due consideration to the respective submissions on the appropriate sentences for the Offender, I was convinced that a significant overall length of imprisonment ought to be imposed but not as long as the total term submitted by the Prosecution.

#### Probation inappropriate

7       I am unable to accept the Defence Submissions that Probation is sufficient to meet the objectives of sentencing in this case. In my view, the dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence, as the offence is so serious that a non-custodial sentence is simply inadequate.

8       Even though this is the Offender’s first brush with the law, the nature of the multiple offences committed by him and the exploitative manner in the commission of the offences over several occasions militate against Rehabilitation being an overriding sentencing consideration.

9       The Defence Counsel submitted that his client was a youthful offender. To say that he was a youthful offender is untenable. The Offender committed the offences when he was 22 years old, which meant he was already an adult, albeit a young adult. I understand the point made by the counsel about his client not being old but it is also important to bear in mind that the victim was a 13-year-old teenager at the material point in time and almost a decade younger.

10     The Defence Counsel characterized this case as one committed as a result of “false steps of youth”. It is an argument not borne out by the facts of the case. The counsel also submitted that it was a chaste relationship. However, the acts of the Offender perpetrated on the victim, on each and every occasion of the 3 times they met, put paid to any such notions.

11     Based on the Statement of Facts admitted to by the Offender without qualification, it was the Offender who broached the topic of exchanging nude photos, saying that he had done so with other girls. He asked her to download the Telegram app and forwarded a photograph of his erect penis to the 13-year-old victim. (_This is the subject-matter of one of the TIC charges – DAC 926953/2018 for the offence of Transmitting an Obscene Image under Section 292(a) of the Penal Code_.) He then asked her to reciprocate with a naked photograph of herself and she duly sent him a photo of her in the nude. (_This is the subject-matter of another TIC charge – DAC 926954/2018 for the offence of Sexual Exploitation of a Child under Section 7(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act_.)

12     These proactive steps of sexual arousal were taken by the Offender before they met on 25 April 2017. A less benign interpretation or inference of what the Offender was doing prior to that meeting would be that he was preparing her for a sexual encounter or at least steering the girl in that direction.

13     The Offender professed to be remorseful for his offences but one cannot help but form the impression, when reading the Mitigation Plea, that he was casting blame on the victim for what had happened in this case. She was painted as the initiator of the sexual activities and a temptress. The Submissions suggested that he could not but succumbed to the seduction of the victim. As mentioned above, it was the Offender who had initiated exchanging sexually explicit images.

14     The admitted Statement of Facts also showed that it was the Offender who had persuaded the girl to fellate him on 25 April 2017. It was also the Offender who had invited the victim to spend time with him at his university hostel room on 29 April 2017 wherein they watched the movie “Fifty Shades of Grey” that led to them engaging in the sexual offences on that day. Lastly, it was the Offender who had asked to insert his penis into her vagina on 5 May 2017. Although she told him she was not comfortable with having sexual intercourse at that time as she was still a virgin, she relented. The Offender then penetrated her vagina with his penis without a condom.

#### Deterrence as the Dominant Sentencing Principle

15     The DPP strongly argued that the Offender ought to receive a sentence of at least 33 months’ imprisonment for, _inter alia_, the following reasons:

> ·    Deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration.

> ·    Undergirding the provisions of Section 376A of the Penal Code is a protective philosophy.

> ·    The law takes a firm and uncompromising stand against offenders that knowingly exploit the young and vulnerable.

> ·    The degree of exploitation in this case was significant. On each of the three occasions they met, the Offender engaged in multiple penetrative sexual acts with the victim.

> ·    The victim continues to suffer the effects of the criminal sexual acts.

16     The DPP cited precedent cases to show that the benchmark sentence is in the range of 10 - 12 months’ imprisonment for Section 376A(2) Penal Code offences where the victims were below 16 years of age. For victims below 14 years of age, the range of sentences were between 13 months and 48 months of imprisonment for offences under Section 376A(3) of the Penal Code. The DPP submitted that a term of at least 15 months’ imprisonment ought to be imposed for the acts of digital penetration of the vagina and fellatio and at least 18 months for the penile-vaginal penetration.

17     The DPP submitted for only two of the sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively, giving at least 33 months’ imprisonment, bearing in mind that there were 8 other charges to be taken into consideration for sentence. The DPP submitted that the only mitigating factor in this case was his plea of guilty.

18     I accept the Prosecution’s submissions that a deterrent sentence is very much warranted in this case. The reasons given for it are indisputable in the light of the facts of this case. I am only unable to accept that the Offender has to be punished with imprisonment of 33 months. My assessment is that 24 months or 2 years would be sufficient to send a clear message for would-be offenders of such offences and would be commensurate with the facts of this case without being excessive.

19     In my assessment of the case, it appears that the DPP had placed an over-emphasis on the Victim Impact Statement (VIS). A careful reading of the VIS would reveal that the victim was not as traumatized as portrayed by the DPP. I agree with the observations of the Defence Counsel that the victim was not coerced or deceived into the various acts. The victim had regrets over her participation in the acts with the Offender and had experienced flashbacks but the regrets and flashbacks were not of any traumatic nature and not as frequent or debilitating as the DPP might suggest. Some weight has to be given to the VIS but not as much as submitted by the Prosecution.

20     Lest I be misunderstood, I am not saying that the victim not being as traumatised, as submitted by the DPP, is a mitigating factor. It is not. I am guided by the High Court case of _PP v Ong Jack Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 166</span> that even if it were true that a victim was not traumatised, that would not be a mitigating factor, it would only mean that there was no such aggravating factor. In our case, the victim was not as traumatised as portrayed by the Prosecution and therefore the weight of this aggravating factor is not as significant as submitted by the DPP.

21     Although Deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle in this case, that did not mean that no consideration can be given to the sentencing principle of Rehabilitation. The prospects of rehabilitation after a significant period of incarceration is a relevant aspect of sentencing. In this respect, I agree with the submissions of the Defence Counsel that there are positive rehabilitative factors in favour of the Offender. Therefore, the sentence of imprisonment should not be longer than is necessary to serve its deterrent effect and avoid delaying his reintegration back into the community.

22     On the specific calibration of the sentences, I found the table of sentencing precedents tendered by the DPP to be useful. The sentences I had passed for this case fell within the range of sentences of the cases cited. In particular, I found the case of _PP v Tan Li De_ in DAC 945219/2016 & Ors to be quite similar to the present case. There the offender was 22 years old and the victim was 13 years old. He was sentenced to a total imprisonment of 23 months for 3 charges with 12 TIC charges. In some ways, the facts in that case could be seen as more serious than the present case but at the end of the day, every case has to be considered on its specific circumstances.

23     In calibrating the specific terms for each offence proceeded with, I had regard to the severity of the nature of each sexual act. It is without doubt that of the 3 sexual acts of digital penetration of the vagina, fellatio and penile-vaginal penetration, the act of penile-vaginal penetration is the most serious. In the case of _PP v Qiu Shuihua_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 949</span>, the punishment enhanced on appeal by Chao Hick Tin JA for the penile-vaginal penetration act was 10 months’ imprisonment while the punishment ordered by the District Judge for the digital-vaginal penetration was left undisturbed at 2 months. It is to be noted that these offences were under Section 376A(2) of the Penal Code with a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

24     According to the guidance provided by the High Court in the case of _PP v Qiu Shuihua_ cited above, it is the overall circumstances of each case that would be determinative of the sentencing for the offences described in Section 376A(1) of the Penal Code. Factual circumstances such as the age of the parties, how the parties came to be acquainted with each other, how long they have known each other before engaging in sexual acts, whether there was an element of the victim being taken advantage of, whether the offence was committed in a calculated, systematic manner or it arose out of impulse without planning, are to be considered. In the present case, the Offender had sexual motives on his mind from the start and easily got the victim interested in sexual matters. His early success in getting the victim to send him a nude photo of herself after he had sent her a picture of his erect penis had emboldened him to advance the relationship quickly to the next level of sexual intimacy with a girl he barely knew.

25     Both the prosecution and the defence has since filed Notices of Appeal against the sentence. The Offender is currently on bail pending the appeal.

ANNEX

**IN THE STATE COURTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE**

**Public Prosecutor v BBB (“Offender”)**

District Court – DAC 926957/2018 & Others

11 February 2020

**ORAL GROUNDS**

1       The Offender has pleaded guilty and was convicted of three charges under the Penal Code, Cap. 224 for the Offences of Sexual Penetration of a Minor who is under 14 years of age. The Prosecution has submitted for a total sentence of imprisonment of at least 33 months. The Defence Counsel is pleading for the 25-year-old Offender to be placed on Probation. He was 22 years old when he committed the offences. There are eight other charges for various offences under the Penal Code (“PC”), the Children and Young Persons Act, Cap. 38 and the Films Act, Cap.107 to be taken into consideration for sentence (“TIC charges”).

2       The three convictions were for sexual acts respectively of digital-vaginal penetration, fellatio and penile-vaginal penetration, which had occurred on three separate occasions. On the first occasion, there were fellatio and digital-vaginal penetration. On the second occasion, which occurred 4 days later, there were similarly fellatio and digital-vaginal penetration. On the 3rd and final occasion 6 days after the 2nd occasion, there were fellatio, digital-vaginal penetration and penile-vaginal penetration. The remaining charges were for sending her a photo of his penis via his hand phone and asking her to send him a naked photo of herself which she did, and for the possession of obscene video files.

3       A person who commits the offence under Section 376A(3) of the Penal Code (“PC”), shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning. Such an offence is triable only in the High Court unless the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) applies to the District Court to try such an offence, and the accused person consents, under Section 9(3)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap. 68 (“CPC”).

4       It is clear that deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle for sexual offences in which the victims are very young, being under 14 years of age. The key consideration is the protection of this vulnerable group. I accept the Prosecution’s submissions, which are well supported by both High Court authorities and sentencing precedents, that a substantial and significant custodial sentence is warranted for the offences in the present case, even though the culprit is a first offender and has pleaded guilty.

5       The DPP has rightly submitted that undergirding the objectives of Section 376A of the Penal Code is a protective philosophy. She has also correctly cited the case of _AQW v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 4 SLR 150</span> (“**_AQW_**”) wherein Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon stated that the twin notions of vulnerability of the minor and the degree of exploitation of the minor would constitute the key considerations for sentencing of offences under Section 376A PC.

6       I accept the following facts highlighted by the Prosecution and which contributed towards the calibration of the sentences in this case:

> ·    While the parties may have expressed fondness for each other, it was evident that their first conversation over the phone turned sexual very quickly, culminating in the Offender sending a photo of his penis to her and asking her for a photo of her in the nude, which she consequently obliged.

> ·    Before there was any time for any proper relationship to form and develop, the first meeting of this 22-year old young adult with a 13 year-old girl progressed promptly to digital-vaginal penetration of her and fellatio being performed on him.

> ·    The degree of exploitation is significant in this case with the Offender engaging in several sexually penetrative acts with the victim on three separate occasions. On the third occasion, it had even led to unprotected, vaginal sexual intercourse. The copulation ceased only because the victim, who was a virgin, asked him to stop as she was in pain due to the intercourse.

7       The Defence Counsel referred to the High Court case of _PP v Qiu Shuihua_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 949</span> (“**_Qiu Shuihua_**”) to make the point that the commission of these offences were a result of “the false steps of youth”. This point is not bourne out in this case. The Offender was already 22 years old at that time while the victim was 13 and the facts and circumstances do not show that they were in a “chaste relationship” (This was a phrase referred to by Judge of Appeal Justice Chao Hick Tin in that case.).

8       In **_Qiu Shuihua_**, the accused was 21 years old while the victim was 14 years of age. The offences of digital-vaginal penetration and penile-vaginal penetration were committed less than a week after they became acquainted. On appeal by the Prosecution against the sentences, the High Court increased the overall imprisonment sentence from 4 months to 10 months.

9       JA Chao in that case touched upon the relevant sentencing factors and considerations for an offence under Section 376A(1) PC and pointed out that the policy behind the statutory provisions criminalising sexual intercourse with minors was protective and paternalistic in nature. It followed that the main consideration in sentencing _vis-à-vis_ such offences was deterrence.

10     It is pertinent to note that in **_Qiu Shuihua_**, the offences were punishable under Section 376A(2) PC for which the maximum punishment of imprisonment is 10 years. This is unlike the offence under Section 376A(3) PC in the present case for which the maximum imprisonment term is 20 years. This difference of double in the maximum custodial sentence does not mean that the punishment for the latter offence must be twice that of the former but it clearly reflects the severity of the seriousness of the offence under Section 376A(3) PC.

11     The Plea in Mitigation made much of the consensual nature of the sexual acts in this case and even suggested that the victim might have been the initiator and was not as traumatised as she had expressed in her victim impact statement. On this point, I can do no better than to quote Chief Justice Menon at Paragraph 23 of his _ex tempore_ judgment in the case of _PP v Ong Jack Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 166</span> at page 177 and 178:

> “… But in the final analysis, even if it were true that she had not been traumatised, that would not be a mitigating factor; it would only mean that there was no aggravating factor…. It is not clear to me why it was thought necessary for a point that appeared, in the final analysis, to be directed at the morality of the victim to be put forward. This is seldom helpful in the context of sexual offences. As officers of the court, counsel should always be mindful of the importance of ensuring the appropriateness and relevance of any submission that he or she is making, and this is especially so where such a submission impugns the character or integrity of a person who is not only _not_ on trial but is in fact the victim of the crime in question.”

I would only add that the above observations are even more relevant in our case as the victim here is a girl who is below the age of 14.

12     As for the calibration of the sentences, the High Court in **_AQW_** and **_Qiu Shuihua_** accepted that the benchmark sentences for penile-vaginal penetration ranges from imprisonment of 10 months to 12 months in relation to offences under Section 376A(2) PC. In the High Court case of _PP v Yap Weng Wah_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 297</span>, purely by way of oblique comparison, Justice Woo Bih Li, hearing at first instance, was of the view that for offences involving fellatio which are punishable under Section 376A(3) PC, in the absence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, six to seven years’ imprisonment should be the benchmark at the first stage of sentencing.

13     After a consideration of all the relevant factors of this case, I hereby impose the following sentences:

> DAC 926957/2018: 6 months’ imprisonment.

> DAC 926960/2018: 12 months’ imprisonment (concurrent with DAC 926957/2018).

> DAC 926962/2018: 18 months’ imprisonment (consecutive to DAC 926957/2018).

> Eight other charges have been taken into consideration for the sentence.

14     The total sentence of 24 months of imprisonment should be sufficient to meet the demands of the dominant sentencing objectives of punishment and deterrence in this case. The principle of rehabilitation went towards a lower sentence than that submitted by the Prosecution but it could not displace the other two operative principles warranting a custodial sentence.
