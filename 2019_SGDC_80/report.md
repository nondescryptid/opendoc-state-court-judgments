### District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam:

1       The accused, Koh Choon Lin Anthony (Koh), claimed trial to two charges under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev. Ed.) (“PCA”). The first charge was for corruptly offering to give to an agent, Choon Yun Chyuan Tesvin (Tesvin), a Sales Manager with NCS Pte Ltd (NCS), a gratification of 30% of the profits earned by Service House Appliance Service (Service House) from servicing NCS, as an inducement to recommend that NCS purchases its supplies from Service House. The second charge was for corruptly giving a gratification of a sum of $200 to Tesvin as a reward for recommending that NCS purchases its supplies from Service House. At the close of the trial, I found Koh guilty and convicted him on both charges. He was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment on the first charge and two weeks’ imprisonment on the second charge with both terms of imprisonment to run concurrently giving a total of eight weeks’ imprisonment. Koh has filed the present appeal against his conviction and sentence. He was granted a stay on the execution of the sentence and is currently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. The Prosecution has filed an appeal against the sentence as well.

2       My grounds for convicting the accused, and for the sentence imposed, are set out below.

## TRIAL

#### Charge

3       The charges to which Koh claimed trial are as follows.

DAC 909913/2015

You \[...\]are charged that you, sometime in July 2012 to August 2012, in Singapore, did corruptly offer to give to an agent, to wit, one Choon Yun Chyuan, a Business Development Manager in the employ of NCS Pte Ltd (“NCS”), gratification of 30% of the profits earned by Service House Appliance Service (“Service House”) from servicing NCS, as an inducement for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, recommending that NCS purchase supplies from Service House, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

DAC 909914/2015

You \[...\]are charged that you, in July 2013, in Singapore, did corruptly give to an agent, to wit, one Choon Yun Chyuan, a Business Development Manager in the employ of NCS Pte Ltd (“NCS”), gratification of a sum of S$200 (Dollars Two Hundred) as reward for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, recommending that NCS purchase supplies from Service House Appliances Services (“Service House”), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

#### Background Facts

4       The accused, Koh, is 54 years old and was a Senior Technical Specialist with the XXX. He joined XXX in 2007. XXX is an agency of MINDEF and consequently, Koh, is considered a public servant at the time of the offences. As a Senior Technical Specialist, Koh was responsible for procuring IT equipment for technology related projects within XXX. He would obtain quotations from vendors and submit an evaluation report with his recommendations and justifications for his choice of vendor. The procurement department in XXX will follow up with the vendors.

5       NCS was a regular supplier of IT products to XXX. NCS had a term contract awarded by IDA known as the JANUS contract. Under this contract, there was a list of IT related items and peripherals which an end user, such as XXX, can purchase from NCS at a fixed price. There was no need for XXX to source for three or more quotations. There was also no requirement for XXX to conduct an evaluation and recommendation for such purchases. In addition to procurement under the JANUS contract, XXX was also able to purchase items it required directly from NCS and other vendors with the requisite security clearance. NCS in turn, will need to purchase its IT products from third-party suppliers to fulfil the orders received from users such as XXX. NCS will try to obtain the lowest possible price to maximise its profits.

6       In the course of his work, Koh dealt regularly with NCS and became acquainted with Tesvin, the Sales Manager at NCS and the client representative in charge of the XXX account. Tesvin had joined NCS in September 2011 and completed his term with them around August 2013. Over time, Koh and Tesvin became friends and they met periodically outside of work, for meals and drinks.

7       Sometime in 2012, Koh and Tesvin met for coffee at a café in XXX. During their conversation, Koh told Tesvin that NCS’ product prices were quite high to which Tesvin replied that he was open to sourcing from new vendors. They met a few months later in June or July 2012 at VivoCity, and Koh introduced a new vendor to Tesvin. This was Service House, which was a dormant company owned by Koh’s brother. Koh informed Tesvin that the company was owned by his cousin and it could be another vendor from whom NCS could purchase its IT supplies. Koh added that XXX has purchased items from Service House in the past. Koh went on to say that they could have a profit-sharing arrangement, with Koh taking 40%, his cousin taking 30% and Tesvin taking the remaining 30%. Tesvin merely said, “Eh crap lah!” in response. Subsequently, Tesvin did introduce Service House to his product specialist at NCS and NCS did purchase IT related items such as cables from Service House through the usual procurement process.

8       In March 2013, Koh’s father passed away and Tesvin attended the funeral wake held for Koh’s father. At the wake, he had given to Koh about $150 to $200 as ‘white gold’ which, according to Chinese custom, is a token sum of money, given to the bereaved family by friends and relatives. According to Tesvin, this is the usual amount which he gives as ‘white gold’ money.

9       On 18 June 2013, Tesvin had sent an email to his network engineer, Andy Tan Chi Yong (“Andy”), recommending that NCS should obtain a quotation from Service House for cables requested by XXX, as their prices were cheap and they had been recommended by XXX. Again on 9 July 2013, Tesvin sent yet another email to Andy stating that the cables requested in the purchase Order from XXX ought to be purchased from Service House as Service House had previously supplied to XXX.

10     In July 2013, Tesvin tendered his resignation and was due to leave the employ of NCS at the end of July 2013. Sometime in the last week of July 2013, Koh and Tesvin met at Toast Box at Marina Bay Sands. Tesvin informed Koh that he had tendered his resignation and would be leaving NCS. Koh wished him well and handed to him $200. Tesvin initially rejected the cash but when Koh persisted, he accepted the money. The two of them then parted company.

#### The Prosecution’s Case

11     The Prosecution’s case in respect of the first charge is that sometime in 2012, Koh had sought to enrich himself financially by using a company belonging to his brother Stephen, called Service House, to bid for and secure contracts with NCS. In July or August of that year, Koh had offered a 30% share of the profits in the enterprise to Tesvin, as an inducement for Tesvin to recommend NCS to purchase supplies from Service House. This offer was rejected by Tesvin.

12     As to the second charge, the Prosecution’s case is that although Tesvin had rejected Koh’s offer, he nevertheless did recommend on at least two occasions in June 2013 and July 2013, for NCS to purchase supplies from Service House. Approximately, one week after this recommendation, in July 2013, Koh did corruptly pay a sum of $200 to Tesvin to reward him for recommending Service House.

13     The Prosecution led evidence from a total of six witnesses and relied on the inculpatory statements given by Koh to the Investigation Officer at CPIB. Koh challenged the admissibility of the statements on grounds that they were involuntarily made. Following an Ancillary Hearing, the statements were found to be voluntarily given and admitted in evidence.

#### The Defence’s Case

14     The Defence did not dispute the following facts; that Koh had said to Tesvin that they could have a profit-sharing agreement with 30% of the profits going to Tesvin if Tesvin recommended Service House to NCS. But it was the Defence’s assertion that this was spoken in a joking manner and was intended as a joke. It was consistent with the nature of their conversations generally, where Koh would routinely crack jokes. When Tesvin responded with a ‘Eh, crap lah’ remark, this arrangement was never discussed again.

15     As for the second charge relating to the payment of $200 by Koh to Tesvin, it is the Defence’s case that Koh was simply paying back a sum of money which Tesvin had likely expended on Koh for meals and drinks when they met up, as well as for the ‘white gold’ money which Tesvin had given to Koh at Koh’s father’s funeral. Koh did not give the $200 with corrupt intent.

#### The Ancillary Hearing

16     I will first deal with the two inculpatory statements sought to be admitted by the Prosecution. The first statement was recorded on 4 September 2013 at 2.30 pm at CPIB after Koh was arrested earlier that morning. The second statement was recorded on 9 January 2014 at 10.50 am at CPIB, almost four months later, when Koh returned to CPIB office after he had been released on bail. In the interim, several further statements had been recorded from him. The Defence had challenged the admissibility of both statements on grounds that the Investigation Officer, Liew Shi Xiong (“Liew”), had obtained the statement as a consequence of threats, inducements and promises made to Koh by Liew. It was also alleged that the circumstances under which the statements were recorded were so oppressive as to have sapped Koh’s free will, rendering him incapable of giving a statement voluntarily. A joint ancillary hearing was held for both statements to determine admissibility. The Defence raised no objections to the joint ancillary hearing and was in agreement that it was appropriate as there was only one recorder for the two statements and the challenges raised for both were similar.

#### (a)   The challenge to admissibility

17     It was the Defence’s case that Koh was not in the right frame of mind when the statements were recorded from him. His mother was visibly upset when the CPIB officers came to his home on 4 September 2013 at about 6.00 am. They knocked loudly on his door and were calling out his name. His mother opened the door to them and when the officers entered, she began to tremble, so much so that Liew had to comfort her in Hokkien saying, “Bo tai chi la. Meng kia”, which translates to mean, “No matter, no need to be scared”. When Koh was eventually brought away, they parted tearfully. Koh was very worried for his mother and was not able to concentrate on the statement taking process. It was worse when according to Koh, he discovered that his brother was arrested as well. Koh asserted that he was worried about who will be caring for his mother as his brother’s wife did not have a good relationship with her. At CPIB, when Koh asked if he could call his mother, Liew had apparently said to him that he will only be able to call his mother after he had given the statement which Liew wanted. Koh complied and produced an inculpatory statement, at the end of which Liew allowed him to speak with his mother.

18     Koh also testified that he was not well and was on medication for diabetes, hypertension as well as cough and cold when he was arrested. He was allowed to bring along his medication. In the morning at CPIB, he had consumed his medicines on an empty stomach as he had no appetite to eat the bread which he was offered. Again at lunch, he ate only one or two mouthfuls of fried rice before taking his medication. Koh stated that the effects of the medication had sapped his will to resist Liew’s efforts to secure an involuntary statement from him.

19     It was also Koh’s position that he had inadequate rest prior to the statement recording. He had taken cough syrup the night before he was arrested but was unable to sleep. At CPIB, he was brought from one stressful activity to the next. The process was relentless and he was not allowed to rest. He had not slept for 36 hours when the statement was taken from him and so the words were a ‘blur’ to him.

#### (b)   The Prosecution’s response

20     The Prosecution led evidence from two witnesses at the ancillary hearing - Liew and one other CPIB officer, Lee Woon Lin (“Lee”), who was with Liew when Koh was arrested in his home. Liew testified that he had gone to Koh’s condominium unit together with his colleague, Lee. They searched Koh’s home and his car before proceeding to CPIB with Koh. Koh was placed in an interview room and given a cup of water, a hot beverage and some bread for breakfast. At about 8.00 am, Liew commenced interviewing Koh alone. There were short water breaks and toilet breaks during the interview process. They stopped for lunch at 1.30 pm when Liew gave Koh a packet of fried rice. He left Koh alone in the room to have his lunch.

21     The statement recording began at 2.30 pm and lasted for about six hours. The interview and the statement recording were done in English. Liew typed out the statement as Koh gave his account. At the end of the recording, Liew went through the statement with Koh for any changes to the statement. When Koh had no further amendments, Liew printed out the statement and handed it to Koh to read over. Koh was also given a pen to make corrections where necessary. Once that was done, both Liew and Koh signed the statement. Liew stated that there was no threat, inducement or promise made to Koh before or during the statement recording.[^1]

22     Liew testified that Koh did not appear unwell, anxious or frightened. He found him to be calm and said that Koh was a cheerful person. Liew said that Koh’s mother was fine as well and he did not observe her to be trembling. He also denied uttering the words in Hokkien to her. If she had been unwell, Liew said that he would have asked her if she required medical attention. He denied that mother and son were tearful when Koh was led away. Liew added that Koh was not handcuffed at all and was allowed access to his medication at all times although Liew did not check what medicines he took or when he consumed them. Likewise, Liew confirmed that Koh was served breakfast and lunch, but he did see how much he ate.[^2]

23     Liew stated that Koh was not observed to be tired. He informed that Koh was given sufficient breaks in between and Liew had asked him prior to the recording process, if he was sufficiently rested and even informed him that if he was feeling unwell at any time, he should let Liew know. Liew added that he would not deny any of his charges medical treatment if they needed it. Otherwise, he would be held responsible if they fell seriously ill. Liew denied that he was afraid to allow Koh to leave the CPIB office to seek medical attention for fear that Koh would attempt to cover his tracks. He candidly said that they had already searched his home and car and seized his laptop and documents.[^3]

24     Liew also denied promising Koh that if he gave an inculpatory statement, he would be allowed to call his mother. Liew said that he allows all accused persons under his charge to call their family members if they so wished. In the same vein, Liew denied instructing or compelling Koh to write in incriminating details into his statements. He pointed out that there were non-incriminating amendments to the statement too. Similarly, at the recording of the second statement, Liew steadfastly denied voicing the threat that he could detain Koh until 5.00 am like he did the last time, if Koh did not give a favourable statement. Liew simply pointed out that other statements had been recorded in between, which did not go on till 5.00 am.[^4]

25     Prosecution also led evidence from the second arresting officer, Lee Woon Lin, who said that both Koh and his mother looked normal throughout the time that he saw them and specifically, Koh did not make any complaints, even when he was brought out to his workplace during the investigations. He reiterated that both Koh and his mother did not display abnormal behaviour.

#### (c)   Statements were voluntarily made

26     At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, several gaps were identified in the Defence’s case. Koh’s allegations of threats and promises were not only bare assertions unsupported by objective evidence, but they were also broad statements lacking in depth and detail. Koh had said that he was not his normal self because he had inadvertently taken more than the prescribed amounts of his medication. When questioned about these medications, he stated generally that they were for his diabetes, hypertension, cough and flu but could not inform of the exact medication which he took for his cough and cold to support his assertion that he was adversely affected by the medicines. He had also admitted that he was aware of the ill effects of taking his hypertension medicine on an empty stomach which is why he made sure that he ate his dinner the night before.[^5] He did not explain why he then chose to consume the medication on an empty stomach at CPIB. In comparison, Liew gave a perfectly reasonable explanation why it is untrue that Koh had told him that he was feeling unwell. Liew said that he would definitely have allowed him to seek medical treatment because he would not wish to be held responsible for the consequences.

27     It was also Koh’s position initially that he was tired because he had not slept for 36 hours but under cross-examination, when it was pointed out to Koh that during cross-examination of Liew by Koh’s counsel, it was suggested that Koh had taken a nap the night before, Koh conceded that he may have slept for one to two hours till about 10.00 pm. It was a clear exaggeration to state that he had not slept for 36 hours when his statement was recorded the following afternoon.[^6]

28     Koh’s position was that the effects of sleep deprivation coupled with medication and the lack of sustenance had made him especially susceptible to the promise issued by Liew that he may call his mother after Koh gave the statement which Liew wanted. Koh said that he was worried for his elderly mother because she had no one to care for her as both his brother and he were in custody and she did not get along with his sister-in-law. Yet it was his sister-in-law who brought his mother to the CPIB office the following morning to post bail for Koh. This is contrary to how Koh had described their relationship.[^7]

29     Koh had also characterised his mother as frail and weak, and \`in need of care but when she appeared in Court to testify on Koh’s behalf, she appeared well and capable of moving around independently. Koh’s mother did not say that she required assistance in her daily activities. Neither did she speak of a strained relationship with her daughter-in-law. She simply said the she was upset and felt fearful when the CPIB officers arrived at her home and arrested her son which is not an unexpected response. It did not render her incapable of continuing with her daily activities or put her in any danger. So, even if it were true that Liew had made the threat or promise to Koh that he could call his mother only after he had produced an incriminating statement, it is difficult to see why Koh would feel compelled to make such a statement simply to earn the privilege of a phone call to her. In any event, the evidence does not support Koh’s contention that Liew had uttered such a promise. Liew has been a credible and consistent witness and there is no reason to disbelief him when he states that he made no such promise.

30     The Defence led evidence from the medical expert, Dr Rasaiah Munidasa Winslow, a psychiatrist, to give his views on the effects of sleep deprivation and the medication which Koh had consumed. Dr Winslow candidly stated that he had only seen Koh the night before he came to Court to testify. He admitted that it would be difficult for him to ascertain now what Koh’s state of mind would have been like at the time the statements were recorded. He stated that if Koh’s account was correct, there would have been an issue of sleep deprivation and a decline in cognitive performance from hypoglycaemia. He agreed under cross-examination that he did not have the details of the medication consumed by Koh to determine if they would have affected his cognitive abilities or if he was suffering from hypoglycaemia. Dr Winslow said that he could not say for certain that the statements had been involuntarily given. Dr Winslow’s evidence did not assist in advancing the Defence’s case.[^8]

31     Based on the evidence led, I found that the Defence’s assertion that Koh had been worn down by the time the statements were recorded from him and the promise or threat from Liew was operating on his mind when he signed the statements was not borne out. I held that the statements were made voluntarily and duly admitted them in evidence.

#### (d)   Weight accorded to the statements

32     Liew’s testimony detailed the statement recording process which was entirely consonant with the usual methods of recording statements in the narrative form. Koh gave his account in English which was typed out by Liew as Koh narrated, after which Liew went over the statement with Koh. When Koh had nothing further to add, it was printed out and handed to Koh to read over. Koh made amendments to the statement in ink and thereafter both Koh and Liew signed the statement. The recording process was the same for both statements. The only impropriety alleged in the recording process was that at the end of the statement recording, Liew is said to have handed the pen to Koh and instructed him to insert incriminating portions into the statements. Liew refuted this suggestion and pointed out that the first statement contained both inculpatory as well as exculpatory amendments made in ink to the statement. In fact, in the second statement, Koh had sought to amend certain facts which he had asserted in the first statement. The Prosecution argued that this demonstrates that Koh was given free rein to state whatever he wished to, in his statements. I accepted Prosecution’s argument and found that on the whole, there was no basis to doubt the veracity of the contents of the statements and I gave full weight to both the statements.

#### The Applicable Law

33     The key elements of an offence under section 6(b) of the PCA which the Prosecution had to prove are:

i)     An offer of a 30% of the share of profits and the payment of an amount of $200 was made by Koh to Tesvin;

ii)     The offer of 30% of the share of profits was made as an inducement to Tesvin to recommend to his employer, NCS, to purchase supplies from Service House;

iii)     The payment of $200 was made as a reward to Tesvin for making such recommendations to NCS;

iv)     The offer of 30% of the share of profits and the payment of $200 were both made by Koh with a corrupt intent.

34     Parties had cited the case of _PP v Low Tiong Choon[^9]_ for the test to be used to determine corrupt intent. In that case, the accused person was a police officer who had accepted a reward for recommending a lawyer to someone who was being investigated for a road traffic offence. The accused person had not investigated the offender and was not connected to him in any way. The Court held that while it was improper for the police officer to accept the reward, and while his conduct may warrant disciplinary action, it was not corrupt for him to do so, as it did not compromise the performance of his official duties. The Court stated that corruption is a question of intention and went on to specify a two-step test for corrupt intent.

_There are two parts to establishing an objectively-corrupt element under the first limb. The first part is to ascertain the intention of the giver or receiver (as the case may be) behind the transaction at the material time, an inquiry which depends on the evidence of the parties concerned as well as the surrounding circumstances. The second part is then to ask whether such an intention tainted the transaction with an objectively-corrupt element, given the factual matrix._

_The surrounding circumstances of the case would no doubt assist the judge in inferring what this intention or ulterior motive (if any) is. Hence surreptitiousness or furtiveness of the transaction, the size of the gratification, the relationship of the parties, breaking of rules or code may, as far as relevant, form part of the surrounding circumstances which, together with all the other evidence, will point towards the proper intention to be inferred._

_Once the inference is drawn, the next question is to place such an intention or ulterior motive (as ascertained by the court) within the factual matrix and ask whether it infected the transaction with a corrupt element by the ordinary and objective standard._

35     I accepted parties’ submissions that the two-step test in PP v Low Tiong Choon would apply to the present case and used it to determine if there was a corrupt intent.

#### Issues before the Court

36     It was undisputed that Koh had offered to give to Tesvin a 30% of the share of profits from the transactions with Service House and had also paid a sum of $200 to Tesvin. The three remaining factual issues which form the basis of the charges are as follows:

i.      _Whether Koh made the offer of a share of the profits as an inducement for Tesvin to recommend Service House to NCS_

ii.      _Whether Koh paid the $200 to Tesvin as a reward for Tesvin having recommended Service House to NCS_

iii.      _Whether the offer and the payment of $200 was accompanied by a corrupt intent on Koh’s part._

37     In determining the first two issues, it is important to address the three terms which appear to have been used somewhat interchangeably by the Defence. They are “introduce”, “recommend” and “award”. The Prosecution’s position is that Tesvin did _recommend_ Service House to NCS but accepted that Tesvin was not in a position to _award_ the contracts to Service House as the vast majority of vendor selections had been done through the Vendor Quotation System. The Defence has argued that there is no need for Tesvin to specifically _introduce_ Service House as anyone can participate in the tender process and any vendor can “cold call” NCS to _introduce_ themselves. A mere _introduction_ by Tesvin is unhelpful as XXX’s security clearance has to be overcome. A mere _introduction_ does not translate into business as there are other key considerations such as cost, quality and security which Tesvin was not involved in. In any event, Tesvin has no power to show favour to Service House in relation to NCS’ affairs.

38     The Prosecution pointed out that under section 9(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241, Tesvin need not be in a position to show favour to Koh. The section states,

_Where, in any proceedings against any person for any offence under section 6(b), it is proved that he corruptly gave, agreed to give or offered any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do any act or for showing or forbearing to show any favour or disfavour to any person having reason to believe or suspect that the agent had the power, right or opportunity to do so, show or forbear and that the act, favour or disfavour was in relation to his principle’s affairs or business, he shall be guilty of an offence under that section notwithstanding that the agent had no power, right or opportunity or that the act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal’s affairs or business._

39     It is clear from a plain reading of the provision, that Tesvin need not have the power, right or opportunity to _award_ a contract to Service House, for the charges to succeed. Neither is it relevant to consider whether Tesvin had _introduced_ Service House as a vendor, and if this _introduction_ was significant enough for Koh to pay a reward to Tesvin or offer the inducement of a share in profits in the first place. The charges here are for _recommending_ Service House to NCS. What needs to be determined is whether Koh wanted Tesvin to _recommend_ Service House as a vendor, so much so that he first offered an inducement to Tesvin to make such _recommendation_, and subsequently, when Koh believed that Tesvin had _recommended_ Service House, he paid a reward of $200. I will consider the first two issues jointly, before evaluating the evidence for the third issue.

#### (a)   Koh’s written statements

40     Following the Ancillary Hearing, the two statements made by Koh to the CPIB Investigation Officer, Liew, were admitted in evidence. The two statements were redacted by the Prosecution to exclude portions that touched on other aspects of the investigations unrelated to the present charges. The Defence had argued strenuously that no weight ought to be attached to the inculpatory portions of the statements; even if they were found to have been made voluntarily, they may not contain the ‘absolute truth’. However, the Defence did not go on to explain why the two statements found to have been made voluntarily, may contain untruths. I have dealt with the issue of veracity of the statements and the weight to be accorded to them earlier on and have found that full weight ought to be given to both statements. I do not propose to re-visit those issues here.

41     In the first written statement to CPIB,[^10] Koh narrates his background and the circumstances which led him to make the proposal to Tesvin to use Service House to supply the required IT products to NCS. Koh stated that as a Senior Technical Specialist with XXX, he would give recommendations on the type of IT equipment required for his projects and submit to the procurement department of XXX, justifications for his choice of vendor from whom the IT products should be purchased. Koh stated that NCS is a regular supplier of IT products to XXX. He explained that his brother, Stephen Koh, was the sole proprietor of the dormant company, Service House. Koh added that he had previously used Service House to bid for tenders with NCS and XXX to supply IT products.

42     Koh further explained that NCS also supplies IT products to XXX at a fixed price through a term contract known as Janus. Under the Janus contract, there is no requirement for NCS to go through the standard procurement process of obtaining three quotations. NCS will source for the IT products directly from third party suppliers and purchase from the vendor offering the lowest price. Koh stated that he had the price list for the items under the Janus contract and he had previously used Service House to quote prices at around 10% to 20% lower than the listed prices in the price list. He had been able to find the items such as cables at Sim Lim Square, Sim Lim Tower and Funan Mall at cheaper prices when they were purchased in bulk. It was such transactions which gave Koh the idea to set up a small business to supply IT products such as patch cables, to NCS through Service House at a lower price.

43     Sometime in July 2012, he broached the subject with Tesvin who replied that he can consider buying the items from Koh’s supplier. Tesvin stated that NCS will buy from the supplier with the lowest price. Koh also spoke with his brother, Stephen, about his idea and his brother agreed to let him use Service House.

44     Subsequently, in July or August 2012, Koh met with Tesvin again. He told Tesvin that Service House was owned by his cousin brother, and that he would use Service House to supply the IT products to NCS which NCS needed to purchase to fulfil the orders from XXX. Koh added that he will be able to earn a small amount of profit from this business venture. Tesvin agreed to help Koh but cautioned that he could not simply let go of all his other suppliers suddenly. He would therefore continue to purchase some products from his existing suppliers and others from Service House. At this juncture, Koh told Tesvin that he would be able to share his profits with Tesvin - 30% each to Koh and Tesvin and the remaining 40% to Stephen. Tesvin did not reply to this proposal and Koh assumed that he had accepted his idea.

45     Koh explained in his statement that the sharing of profits was intended as a commission to Tesvin for allowing Koh to submit Service House’s quotations to NCS and for informing Koh of NCS tenders for IT parts as well as for not revealing to others that Koh was using Service House to bid for tenders with NCS. However, he did not disclose these reasons to Tesvin. Koh said that even though 30% of profits was meant to be given to Tesvin after every successful bid by Service House, the monies were never paid by Koh and neither did Tesvin ask for his share. Koh added that he did not know how exactly Tesvin would help him. He stated the following in his first written statement.

_I do not know how Tesvin will help me to ensure that NCS will purchase the products from Service House. He has never told me before how he can help me by awarding the contract to Service House. I only know that NCS will purchase products from the supplier with the lowest quote. As I have access to the price list of the fixed contract between NCS and XXX, I had used Service House to quote the prices of IT products to NCS at 10% to 20% lower than the prices NCS will sell to XXX. Once the quotation reached NCS, I do not know what will happen and I have no control over it. Tesvin also did not tell me how he will help Service House by awarding the contract to Service House. I wish to add that there were some quotations in which Service House was not used as a supplier by NCS._

46     In his second written statement, Koh clarified that he had given to Tesvin a sum of $200 and not $2,000 when he met him at Marina Bay Sands in August 2013. In his first statement, Koh had said that he had paid a sum of $2,000 to Tesvin. He made the following amendment in his second written statement.[^11]

_I wish to correct my previous statements. I have earlier stated in paragraph 26, 27, and 28 that sometime in July or August 2013, I have given Tesvin $2,000/- at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) for him to purchase his annual levy, so as to thank him for helping to recommend business from NCS to Service House, I wish to state that the cash money that I have given to Tesvin was $200/- and not $2,000/-. I would like to explain why I have changed the figures._

47     Koh proceeded to explain that he had checked his bank statements and subsequently discovered his error, prompting him to amend his statement with the CPIB. He explained,

_While I was drawing out money, I decided to give $200/- to Tesvin from the $650/- that I had drawn out. I then went to find Tesvin, who was then at the casino counter. I then passed him $200/-. I did not say anything to Tesvin but in my opinion, this $200/- is to thank him for helping to recommend to NCS to purchase IT supplies from Service House. Tesvin declined to take the money but I insisted and pushed it to him. He then relented and accepted the money._

48     The two written statements are clear evidence of what Koh’s intent was. When Koh proposed to Tesvin a 30% share in the profits, it was to ensure that Tesvin will recommend to NCS to _award the contract to Service House_, and the payment of $200 was to _thank him for helping to recommend business from NCS to Service House_. It is plain that Koh intended for them to be an inducement and a reward to Tesvin to recommend or send business to Service House from NCS.

#### (b)   Emails evincing Tesvin’s recommendations

49     The Prosecution adduced in evidence two sets of email exchanges between Tesvin and Andy, the network engineer at NCS. The first email chain started on Friday, 14 June 2013 with an email request from one Gan Sze Ping[^12] at XXX to Tesvin and copied to Andy and one other person for the supply of IT products such as cables from NCS. On Tuesday, 18 June 2013, Andy informed Tesvin via email that he was still waiting for a quotation from a supplier for one of the items. Tesvin responded to Andy on the same day recommending Service House as a source. Tesvin in his reply email had stated, “Service house cables is cheap also…recommended by XXX”.

50     The second email chain originated from Koh on Monday, 1 July 2013[^13] and was sent to Tesvin requesting for a particular IT equipment on behalf of XXX. In subsequent emails on Tuesday, 9 July 2013 and Wednesday 10 July 2013, both from Tesvin to Andy, Tesvin informed Andy to obtain from Service House five of the items listed in the Purchase Order received from XXX. Tesvin once again stated that Service House had previously supplied these products to XXX.

51     The two sets of emails present clear evidence that Tesvin had on more than one occasion, specifically made recommendations for IT products to be sourced from Service House. He had also endorsed his recommendation by stating that Service House had supplied the products to XXX in the past.

#### (c)   Evidence of Prosecution witnesses

52     The two key witnesses for the Prosecution were Tesvin and Andy. Their testimonies fleshed out the circumstances under which Service House came to be recommended to supply IT equipment for orders placed with NCS, including the purchase orders received from XXX.

53     Tesvin told the Court that he was working as a Sales Manager with NCS when he became acquainted with Koh, who was a project manager with XXX. Tesvin explained that he was the client representative serving XXX which was one of his main accounts. Tesvin recounted that sometime in March 2012, Koh gave feedback that NCS’ prices were quite high to which Tesvin replied that he was open to dealing with new vendors. Thereafter, Koh introduced three vendors to Tesvin but Tesvin found their prices to be high as well. Tesvin explained that he would purchase the items from the vendor with the lowest price to maximise profits for NCS. Tesvin testified that under the Janus contract, when XXX required an item, it would submit a Purchase Order to him. The engineers at NCS will then obtain quotes from different vendors before purchasing at the cheapest price to sell to XXX. Tesvin stated that even if NCS was able to get a lower price, the items would still be sold to XXX at a fixed price under the Janus contract.[^14]

54     In June or July 2012, Tesvin met with Koh again. At this meeting, Koh told Tesvin that his cousin owned a company called Service House and asked Tesvin to introduce Service House as an additional option to his list of vendors. Koh suggested to Tesvin that they could have a profit-sharing arrangement where Koh would take 40% of the profits from the transacted deals between Service House and NCS while Tesvin and Koh’s cousin would get 30% each. Tesvin testified that he rejected the offer. He simply brushed it aside and moved on to another topic.[^15]

55     Tesvin added that he had never received any of the 30% share of profits which was offered to him by Koh. Instead, when he was serving his last week with NCS, he met Koh at Toast Box at MBS for coffee. They chatted for a while after which Tesvin left for the casino. Koh then appeared at the casino entrance and passed $200 to Tesvin. Tesvin initially rejected the money but when Koh persisted, Tesvin simply took the money as he did not wish to embarrass Koh. Tesvin assumed that it was a token of appreciation from Koh for recommending Service House to NCS.[^16]

56     Tesvin’s attention was next drawn to the two emails. In the first email to Andy, Tesvin had stated that Service House was recommended by XXX. Tesvin clarified that this was not entirely correct; it was Koh and not XXX who had recommended Service House. Koh had told Tesvin that XXX had been purchasing from Service House and Tesvin said that he had not independently verified this. Tesvin explained that he had written this in the email to Andy to indicate to Andy that Service House was cleared by XXX. In the second email, Tesvin agreed with the Prosecution that he had recommended to Andy to get five of the items listed in the Purchase Order from Service House. Tesvin added that there had been other occasions apart from those covered in the two emails, when he had recommended Service House.

57     During cross-examination, Tesvin agreed with the Defence that vendors of IT products could actually cold call NCS to introduce themselves in order to get onto the list of suppliers. Both the finance department and the product specialist team at NCS would do a background check on the supplier before the supplier is accepted onto the panel of vendors. In the case of Service House, it had an additional factor in its favour; that it had previously supplied to XXX and was therefore cleared by XXX. Ultimately, it is the cost and the quality of the product which would determine who the contract is awarded to. Tesvin added that Koh had informed him that Service House was cleared by XXX and he had accepted that at face value as Koh was an employee of XXX. Tesvin said that he did not independently verify the information after he spoke with Koh and had simply passed the details of Service House to his product specialist and the finance department at NCS.[^17]

58     Tesvin agreed with the Defence that he had become friends with Koh and met up with Koh regularly, socially. Koh would often joke with him. So when Koh’s father passed away in March 2013, Tesvin attended the funeral and in keeping with Chinese custom, handed a sum of $150 or $200 to Koh. This payment of money is termed as ‘white gold’ or ‘bai jin’ in Chinese and is intended to help with the funeral expenses. Tesvin acknowledged that he had often paid for Koh’s coffee, drinks and meals when they went out but he disagreed with the Defence that when Koh handed to him the $200 outside the casino, it was meant to reimburse him for the ‘white gold’ money which Tesvin had given to Koh as well as the monies spent on Koh’s meals and drinks. Tesvin thought that the sum of $200 from Koh was a token of appreciation for introducing Service House.[^18]

59     Tesvin agreed with the Defence that when Koh and he met in June or July 2012, Koh was joking with him as usual and it was in this same joking manner that Koh had offered to him a 30% share in the profits. Tesvin said that he chose to treat the offer as a joke and responded with, “eh, crap lah” because in his view, it was not the right thing to do, and he wanted to brush it off as a joke.[^19]

60     The second key Prosecution witness was Andy. Andy told the Court that he joined NCS in 2013 as a sales specialist and worked with Tesvin who was the accounts manager. According to Andy, his role was to support the accounts managers with costing from different vendors and to prepare the quotations. Tesvin would receive a request from customers on a purchase and Andy would source for quotations from the distributors and the vendors to get the exact cost. These quotations would then be fed into the Vendor Quotation System (VQS) and the system will select the most cost effective solution to ensure fair awarding.

61     Andy was referred to the two emails sent by Tesvin to him. With reference to the first email, Andy stated that he understood Tesvin’s remark, “Service House cables is cheap also” to mean that Tesvin is recommending that Andy gets the cables from Service House because it is cheap. As for the second email, Andy testified that he interpreted that email to mean that Tesvin wanted him to ‘fulfil’ items 8 and 9-11 from Service House as they had supplied to XXX before. Andy said that he did not get quotations from the other suppliers because the instruction from Tesvin was to go with this particular company. Tesvin had recommended Service House and he had no reason to doubt the instructions from his accounts manager and seek alternative quotations. Andy added that he would get to know potential vendors at IT shows as well as through recommendations from his colleagues.[^20]

62     During cross-examination, Andy was asked to produce other emails which he received from Tesvin relating to purchase orders from NCS’ customers. Andy presented one email where Tesvin had recommended a company called Ingram to supply the products requested by XXX. Andy clarified during re-examination that Ingram was used to supply products for CISCO’s order and not for XXX. Service House was not an authorised distributor for CISCO. Andy agreed with the Defence that other than the instances referred to in the two emails, there had been previous occasions when Tesvin had recommended Service House and NCS had been using Service House even before he joined NCS.

#### (d)   Koh’s flawed defence

63     Koh elected to give evidence when his defence was called. His cautioned statement which was recorded in response to the second charge was admitted through him. The cautioned statement to the first charge had been admitted in evidence during Prosecution’s case.

64     Koh’s defence simply was that he had had been joking when he mentioned the profit sharing arrangement to Tesvin. He had said, “If the business was successful, I would give you 30% of the profit and I would get the other 30% and then my male elder cousin would get 40%”. Tesvin had waved his hand and smilingly said, ‘Crap’. Likewise, he said that there was nothing sinister in the payment of $200 to Tesvin. Koh’s position was that it was an act of spontaneous generosity. Tesvin was leaving NCS and they had shared a close working relationship. They had also become friends and Tesvin had been kind and generous to Koh, paying for Koh’s meals and drinks when they met and attending Koh’s father’s funeral, during which he had given the ‘white gold’ money. Koh stated that the $200 was intended to repay Tesvin for his kindness and generosity. They had met at Toast Box at Marina Bay Sands, chatted and parted company. Tesvin had headed to the casino and Koh had gone to the ATM to withdraw some money. He met Tesvin at the casino entrance and handed the $200 to Tesvin. Tesvin had initially refused but when Koh persisted, Tesvin accepted the $200 before going into the casino.[^21]

65     According to Koh, he would often joke with Tesvin, making silly comments like if he were to strike the Toto, he would travel the world with his friends in business class. Koh stated that over time, they had become close friends and Tesvin had been supportive and had lent a listening ear in his times of need such as when his father was ill.

66     Koh testified that in 2012, he discovered that the prices quoted by NCS were high. He needed some cables and had gone to Funan Centre, Sim Lim Square and Sim Lim Tower to look for cables. He found one of them being sold for $6 to $8 whereas NCS had quoted $12. He said that this was not good for XXX and he decided to use Service House to make an offer to XXX’s purchasing department. Koh added that if he wanted NCS to know Service House, he could simply call NCS and introduce the products. However, because he knew Tesvin, he decided to go through Tesvin. He did not tell Tesvin that Service House was being operated by himself and instead said that his cousin was running the company as he did not want Tesvin to think that there might be a conflict of interests.

67     The two cautioned statements in response to the two charges were recorded on different dates. Both were admitted in evidence without any objections to their admissibility on grounds of voluntariness. The cautioned statement to the first charge was recorded on 23 March 2015 between 9.47 am and 9.53 am.[^22] In response to the first charge Koh had stated,

_This was not carried out as Choon Yun Chyuan did not verbally agreed. Choon Yun Chyuan did not ask me for any gratification when NCS purchase supplies from Service House. We did not bring this up after our first discussion. I like to state that this was not carried or agreed upon._

68     The cautioned statement to the second charge was recorded next on the same day between 9.54 am and 10.07 am.[^23] Here Koh states,

_When Choon Yun Chyuan and myself met on the July 2013, Choon Yun Chyuan told me he is leaving his company, NCS as he has already tendered his resignation. Choon Yun Chyuan has been a good friend of mine and has helped me and XXX, the company in all our IT requirements, purchases and help as he is serving XXX as one of his strategic customers. Choon Yun Chyuan has never asked me for any thing even when he recommending Service House as one of NCS suppliers. He had told me that all NCS purchases would need to go through his purchasing department and he has no say to which suppliers NCS to award._

_In March 2013, when my father was seriously ill before he died on 10 March 2013, Choon Yun Chyuan was very concern about me as I was very worried on my father health. When my father passed away, Choon Yun Chyuan gives $200 for my father wake._

_When he told me he is serving his resignation on the July 2013, I felt happy for him and I pass $200 as a friendship. I did not specified this is a gratification as reward for doing a act or recommending Service House to NCS. Choon Yun Chuyan did not want initially. I like to state that I pass him $200 as a friendship for all the things he has done for me and the company._

69     The first observation which I made about the cautioned statements was how they differed from his previous long statements recorded two years earlier, immediately after his arrest, and his defence in Court.

70     The first cautioned statement was not vastly different from his previous long statement. The emphasis here was that the profit sharing agreement had not been carried out. What is significant here is that there is no mention that the profit sharing agreement had been uttered in jest and was meant as a joke. The ‘joke defence’ was new and only raised during the trial. I noted that the first cautioned statement did not depart from the long statement in this regard. Koh conceded that he had spoken of a profit sharing agreement with Tesvin for purchases by NCS from Service House. Koh however took pains to emphasise in both statements that no payments were actually made to Tesvin and Tesvin had not asked for them either. Koh never elaborated in either of his statements that this was because it was a joke and was not intended to be taken seriously. The ‘joke defence’ was only canvassed at the trial. I found that given the surrounding circumstances, discussed below, do not support the ‘joke defence’.

71     Koh’s second cautioned statement recorded in response to the second charge differed from his long statements. In the first long statement, he had stated that the payment of the sum of $2,000 was intended as a commission to Tesvin for assisting with the quotations from Service House to NCS. In the second long statement, Koh corrected the amount from $2,000 to $200. He made no amendment to the intention behind the payment of the sum of money in the second long statement which was recorded about three months after the first. This change was only reflected in the second cautioned statement recorded about 1½ years later. In the second cautioned statement, he took the position that the $200 was meant to mark their friendship and was not intended as a reward or gratification to Tesvin for recommending Service House to NCS. A further variation of this defence was presented at trial where Koh stated that the $200 was meant to repay Tesvin for the ‘white gold’ money given at Koh’s father’s funeral and for Koh’s meals and drinks which Tesvin had paid for in the past. I noted that not only was Koh’s defence evolving with time but again, this defence was not supported by the objective evidence, which is discussed below.

72     The evidence led at the trial showed that Koh had made significant profits through Service House. During his evidence in chief, Koh stated that in July 2012, he had used Service House to offer to supply Cat 6 cables to XXX. This was a direct purchase by XXX and not through NCS under the Janus contract. Koh had purchased the required amount of cables for about $1,500 and sold it to XXX for $2,975 making an almost 100% profit. NCS had quoted a price which was about 30% higher. These were cables required for a project managed by Koh. When Koh’s colleague sent an email to Koh asking who he should procure the cables from, Koh recommended that the purchase be made from ‘Service House’. Koh’s explanation for this transaction was that he was testing XXX’s purchasing department.

73     During cross-examination, Koh was shown an invoice dated 7 May 2012 where XXX had procured cables from Service House. It was pointed out to Koh that there was no need to test XXX’s purchasing department in July 2012 because XXX had already been purchasing from Service House since 7 May 2012. Koh was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation and he merely said that the latter contract was for a different type of cables. It was also pointed out by the Prosecution that in fact, the prices quoted by Service House for the May 2012 contract were higher than NCS’ prices. Two things emerged from this line of questioning. Koh was shown to be untruthful and it was shown that his true motive was financial gain.

74     It is also significant that Koh had approached Tesvin and made the profit-sharing offer in July 2012. Sometime in early 2012, Koh had discovered that he can purchase the cables at a low price from retailers in Sim Lim Square etc. His brother had allowed him the use of the company, Service House. In May and July 2012, Koh had successfully sold the cables to XXX at a handsome profit. As he explained in his long statement to the CPIB Investigation Officer, Koh had stumbled on a business idea and he wanted to explore his idea with NCS. He had the price list from NCS which tells him the prices at which the products are sold to XXX. Koh would need to quote a lower price for NCS to consider Service House’s offer. As stated by Tesvin, NCS would purchase at the lowest price to maximise its profits. In Koh’s mind, a recommendation from Tesvin probably meant a better chance of Service House being awarded the contract. After all, Koh had similarly promoted Service House to supply for his own project at XXX in July 2012. As Koh had stated in his long statement, he did not know how Tesvin could help him but he believed that Tesvin would recommend and award the Purchase Order from NCS to Service House.

75     The Defence has argued that there was no need for Tesvin to _introduce_ Service House to NCS. Anyone can call up NCS and request to be considered as a prospective vendor. As I stated earlier, the charge here is for _recommending_ Service House which is something more than a mere introduction. Koh understood that a recommendation is important and in fact had personally known the benefits of a recommendation through Service House’s dealings with XXX. Andy’s evidence in Court was also a testament to the significance of a recommendation from a colleague. Andy had said that when Tesvin recommended Service House, he did not obtain any other quotations as he had no reason to doubt Tesvin. There is no doubt that Koh was after a recommendation and not a mere introduction when he made the profit-sharing suggestion to Tesvin. This would explain why he had concealed from Tesvin that Service House was owned by his brother and was being operated by himself, for fear that Tesvin would not agree as there is a clear conflict of interest. If it was merely a joke, why the need for the subterfuge. Having considered all the circumstances, I concluded that Koh intended for the offer of a share in the profits to act as an inducement to Tesvin to recommend Service House for NCS’ procurement contracts.

76     I turn now to address the payment of $200 to Tesvin. In July 2013, Koh met Tesvin at Toast Box at Marina Bay Sands when Tesvin announced that he had resigned from NCS. After their meet-up, Koh withdrew some money from the ATM and handed $200 to Tesvin. Koh has offered varying reasons for giving Tesvin $200. He began with an admission of wanting to reward Tesvin for recommending Service House, then recanted any illicit intent during his evidence in Court and claimed that it was a mark of friendship. The Prosecution highlighted the proximity in time between a recommendation made by Tesvin and the payment of the $200 by Koh. Tesvin had made a recommendation on 10 July 2013 to Andy to use Service House for a contract which amounted to $20,495. Koh paid the $200 to Tesvin on 17th or 18th July 2013. The Prosecution argued that it was not an innocent payment and was meant to reward Tesvin.

77     The Defence argued that the $200 payment does not come anywhere close to a 30% share of the profits previously spoken of. It was also made more than a year after they had discussed the profit-sharing arrangement. The Prosecution responded that it was incorrect to conflate the two charges and that they are distinct and separate. The Defence further argued that the money was meant to repay the ‘white gold’ money given by Tesvin as well as to reimburse Tesvin for payments made towards Koh’s meals and drinks. The Prosecution countered that Tesvin and Koh had met on numerous occasions since Koh’s father’s funeral wake in March 2013 and Koh had ample opportunity to repay Tesvin; this payment was simply a reward for the recent recommendations made. I accepted that Koh was not repaying Tesvin for monies spent on Koh. If that was the case, he could have simply stated his intentions when Tesvin initially refused to take the money. That would have been the natural thing to do instead of silently thrusting the money at Tesvin unless Koh did not wish to articulate his true intentions since Tesvin had previously brushed off the profit-sharing offer. I also accepted the argument that Koh could have made the repayment much earlier and this payment was suspiciously close to the recent recommendations made by Tesvin. These circumstances taken together with Koh’s admissions in his long statements led me to conclude that Koh had paid the $200 as a reward to Tesvin for recommending Service House.

#### An objectively corrupt element

78     Having determined the intentions of Koh, I turn now to consider whether his intentions tainted his dealings with Tesvin with an objectively corrupt element. Using the test set out by the Court in _PP v Low Tiong Choon_, I examined the evidence led under the specific headers used by the Court.

#### (a)   A question of proximity

79     This issue has been dealt with earlier. The main thrust of the Defence’s submissions was that the payment of $200 was done long after the suggestion from Koh to Tesvin to co-share the profits earned by Service House following recommendations from Tesvin to NCS. It is erroneous for the Defence to link the $200 payment to Koh’s offer. Tesvin had rejected the offer and there was no evidence to suggest that Koh’s payment was connected to that offer. What the evidence did show was that Koh’s payment had come a mere week after Tesvin had recommended Service House to Andy and is so proximate in time as to taint the payment as being objectively corrupt.

#### (b)   Furtiveness

The Defence argued that the payment of the $200 was not corrupt because this was done in a public place. Furtiveness is not just about the location but also the manner in which the individual conducts himself. Koh was careful to make the offer in the course of what would otherwise seem to be a casual meet-up for coffee and chit-chat which would not have ordinarily raised any suspicion. Koh was also careful to conceal the true identities of the owner and operator of Service House. Likewise, the giving of the $200 was accompanied with the same furtiveness of one who wished to mask his true intent. Koh did not state what the money was for but simply showed up at the casino entrance and persisted in handing the money to Tesvin. Nothing was uttered which could have been overheard by others. Koh’s subterfuge and the surreptitious manner certainly carried the suggestion of a corrupt element.

#### (c)   Quantum

The Defence submitted that the $200 was a bona fide gift and not a bribe. The amount was too low to constitute the 30% share of the profits resulting from Tesvin’s recommendation. While it is generally accepted that the sum of $200 is low, it is not precluded from constituting a bribe. As stated earlier, it is incorrect to treat the $200 as a share of the profits earned by Koh since Tesvin had rejected the profit-sharing idea. What it is, is an outright reward to Tesvin for recommending Service House. This was plainly stated in Koh’s long statements.

#### (d)   Special Relationship

80     The Defence argued that Tesvin had developed a close friendship with Koh. He had even attended Koh’s father’s funeral and given to Koh a sum of $150 to $200 as the customary ‘white-gold’ money. Tesvin had also shown kindness to Koh. All of this points to the conclusion that the $200 was meant to be a friendly gift. The Prosecution argued that the Defence’s reasoning was flawed. The is no custom of paying back ‘white-gold’ money which has been received and the money spent by Tesvin on Koh’s meals and drinks would be reimbursed to Tesvin as an entertainment expense. In short, there was no need to repay Tesvin. It is also fallacious to suggest that there can be no corrupt transactions amongst close friends. Some corrupt transactions rely on a previous special relationship between parties especially where business dealings are concerned. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the friendship between Tesvin and Koh was no bar for a corrupt transaction between the two.

#### (e)   Power to show favour

81     This point was dealt with earlier. The Defence took the position that Tesvin was in no position to grant any favour to Koh. The evidence led proved that this was untrue. Tesvin’s recommendations were highly regarded and acted upon. Andy for one, accepted Tesvin’s recommendations and did not attempt to obtain any more quotations. In any event, through the operation of section 9(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241), the giver of an inducement or a reward shall be guilty of an offence under section 6(b) of the Act, notwithstanding that the agent had no power, right or opportunity to show favour or disfavour in relation to his principal’s affairs or business.

#### (f)   Of codes and rules

82     Finally, the Defence submitted that the breaking of a code of conduct, in this case Koh moonlighting while working for XXX and supplying products to XXX through NCS and thereby availing himself of business opportunities, while being reprehensible and likely actionable for breach of employment terms, is not indicative of corruption per se. The Prosecution cited section 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241) which states,

_8_.     _Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence under section 5 or 6, it is proved that any gratification has been paid or given to or received by a person in the employment of the Government or any department thereof or of a public body by or from a person or agent of a person who has or seeks to have any dealing with the Government or any department thereof or any public body, that gratification shall be deemed to have been paid or given and received corruptly as an inducement or reward as hereinbefore mentioned unless the contrary is proved._

83     In the present case, the Prosecution argued that Koh had failed to displace the presumption in the section. I agreed that given the proximate time of the payment with the recommendation by Tesvin and the circumstances of the previous offer to Tesvin, Koh had failed to discharge the burden proving the lack of a corrupt intent.

#### Verdict

84     At the close of the trial, I found that the Prosecution had adduced sufficient evidence to establish every ingredient of the two charges. I was satisfied that based on the witness accounts and the confessions contained in Koh’s statements, Koh had made a corrupt offer and payment to Tesvin. I rejected the defence that the offer was a mere joke and that the $200 was meant to return the ‘white-gold’ money and/or to reimburse Tesvin for monies spent on Koh or simply a friendly gift. I held that Prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and found Koh guilty and convicted him on both charges.

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

85     The Prosecution informed the court that Koh was a first offender. The DPP submitted that the custodial threshold was crossed and sought a sentence of at least 12 weeks’ imprisonment for the first charge and two weeks’ imprisonment for the second charge with both terms of imprisonment to run consecutively giving a total of fourteen weeks’ imprisonment. In his submissions on sentence, the DPP highlighted that public sector corruption is a serious offence and deterrence is a major consideration in sentencing. He cited the case of _PP v Ang Seng Thor_[^24] which stood for the proposition that a custodial sentence is the norm for a public sector corruption offence. In his judgement, V K Rajah JA, had summarised the sentencing principles applicable to corruption cases and set out the following propositions.

(a)      _The public service rationale refers to the public interest in preventing a loss of confidence in Singapore's public administration (see Chua Tiong Tiong at \[17\]-\[19\]);_

(b)      _Where there is a risk of this harm occurring, a custodial sentence is normally justified (see Chew Suang Heng at \[9\]- \[11\])_

(c)      _This sentencing principle is presumed to apply where the offender is a government servant or an officer of a public body, but it may also apply to private sector offenders where the subject matter of the offence involves a public contract or a public service. This includes private sector offences that concern regulatory or oversight roles such as marine surveying (see Lim Teck Chye (\[17\] supra) at \[66\]-\[68\])._

(d)      _Although triggering the public service rationale is one way in which a private sector offender may be subject to a custodial sentence, it is not the only way: the custody threshold may be breached in other circumstances, depending on the applicable policy considerations and the gravity of the offence as measured by the mischief or likely consequence of the corruption (see Lim Teck Chye at \[65\] and Zhao Zhipeng at \[32\]). In addition, factors such as the size of the bribes, the number of people drawn into the web of corruption and whether such conduct was endemic will all be relevant to the consideration of whether a custodial sentence is justified._

_At the end of the day, it must be borne in mind that the main sentencing considerations in corruption cases are deterrence and punishment (see, to similar effect, Regina v Gordon Foxley (1995) 16 Cr App R (S) 879 at 885). Indeed, the preservation of a corruption-free environment has always been a cornerstone of governance in Singapore. It would not be wrong to say that in Singapore deterrence is always a relevant sentencing consideration in corruption cases._

86     The DPP went on to make the following submissions on the aggravating factors present in this case.

#### (a)   Abuse of position

87     Koh was a project manager in a sensitive government agency at the material time. Clothed with the authority of his position, Koh sent emails requesting for particular purchases to be made, and acted as the receiving officer for the goods in question. By using his position, Koh had taken advantage of his role in XXX’s procurement process, effectively rendering himself as a requestor, recommender, supplier, approver, and ultimate profit receiver.

#### (b)   Potential damage to the reputation of MINDEF

88     This case had the potential to generate a vast amount of public interest, coupled with public disquiet that one of MINDEF’s own officers, involved in procurement of sensitive matter, was involved in a corrupt scheme with an agent of a vendor company to MINDEF. Koh was a project manager, and was in a position of significant importance.

89     Koh engaged in corrupt behaviour that would undoubtedly have brought disrepute to the parent Ministry he was under. The effect of such conduct is to undermine the standing of our security agencies and the reputation of MINDEF. This has been explicitly recognised in _Law Aik Meng_[^25] where the Court noted that certain crimes had a “wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public”. Koh must thus be held to a higher standard of unimpeachable conduct in his dealings with vendors.

90     The potential prejudice to the standing and reputation of public organisations constitutes an intangible harm, which is a factor that must be taken into account in sentencing Koh.

#### (c)   Loss of trust in the integrity of the procurement system

91     Apart from potential harm to the reputation of MINDEF, Koh’s acts undermined the integrity of an established procurement process. If left unchecked, this sort of conduct may be construed that it is acceptable for vendors to develop collateral pecuniary relationships with public servants. Such perception would have a highly detrimental effect on public confidence in the integrity of government procurement processes.

#### (d)   Lack of remorse shown in the conduct of his defence

92     Koh had shown a lack of remorse by conducting his defence in a manner which had cast doubt on the intentions of innocent Investigation Officers. This included the explicit line of argument that he had been oppressed by officers of the CPIB to the extent that his will had been sapped, that he had virtually been held in fear for the well-being of his elderly mother. The DPP submitted that all these were proved to be untrue, when it was established that in fact it was his mother who had arrived, accompanied by her daughter-in-law, to deal with his bail.

93     The DPP concluded by stating that there were no sentencing precedents that are of direct assistance to this case. Most reported cases involving public servants were in relation to corrupt offers made to law enforcement officials, which would not be of use here. He highlighted the High Court case of _Chua Tiong Tiong v PP[^26]_ where it was held that in most cases, the giver of gratification bears equal culpability to that of the receiver. He submitted that cases involving ‘givers’ can be of limited guidance and cited precedents where the sentence meted out was three months’ imprisonment per charge.

#### Mitigation plea and Defence’s submissions on sentence

94     The Defence Counsel submitted that the present offences did not involve the public sector. Koh’s conduct related entirely to his private company, Service House and he did not in any way act in his capacity as a public servant. The Defence Counsel further submitted that the DPP’s submissions on the potential damage to the reputation of the Ministry is speculative in nature. The trial had been held in camera and the fear that the details Koh’s offences being exposed is unfounded. The Defence Counsel reiterated that Koh was merely operating a private company and supplying from a private company to the organisation in which Koh was involved. He argued that the mere fact that Koh was aware of opportunities in the public service and from those opportunities, he had reached out to someone in the private sector, does not make this a public sector case.

95     Based on his submissions that this is a private sector corruption, the Defence Counsel argued for a non-custodial sentence. He stated that this was not a case where substantial sums of money had changed hands. It is a case where a promise was made 12 months earlier before a relatively small sum of money was passed. He argued that a fine is more than sufficient deterrence in the present case. The Defence Counsel cited a set of cases where fines ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 were imposed.

#### Sentencing considerations

96     The offence of corruptly offering or giving a gratification as an inducement or a reward for doing or forbearing to do any act in relation to one’s his principle’s affairs shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

97     In the present case, I accepted Prosecution’s submissions that this case without a doubt involved the public sector. Koh had abused his position as an employee of a government agency, XXX, and gone to extraordinary lengths to manipulate the procurement process for his personal gain. He had involved his brother and an employee of a vendor company in his scheme to earn significant profits. I was without a doubt that the custody threshold had been firmly crossed in this case.

98     I agree with the Prosecution that there is a dearth of cases involving public servants who had made corrupt offers. Most cases for offences under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act were in relation to corrupt offers made to law enforcement officers. Nonetheless, I found them to be a useful guide in sentencing. In the case of _PP v Lim Teck Choon_[^27] V K Rajah JA affirmed the sentencing approach that for public sector corruption, a custodial sentence was the norm and in that case he set aside the fine imposed by the lower court and imposed a term of six weeks’ imprisonment. The offence committed was an offer of a gratification in the form of a favour to a Traffic Police Officer. He had cited with approval a previous Magistrate’s Appeal case, _Gay Wee Keong v PP_[^28], in relation to sentencing framework adopted by the Appellate Court for that case in arriving at a custodial sentence. In _Gay’s_ case, a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was imposed for a corrupt offer of $100 made to a Traffic Police Officer.

99     I have noted that in the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution, significant sums of money had changed hands as a consequence of the bribes offered. For the first charge in the present case, it was simply an offer made and no monies changed hands. This was akin to the case of _PP v Lim Teck Choon_ where a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was imposed where a favour was offered to a Traffic Police officer. In the instant case, I held that a term of eight weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate for the first charge.

100    As for the second charge, taking into account the relatively low sum of money involved, I agreed with the Prosecution that a term of two weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate. I took the view that both offences arose out of the same set of circumstances involving Koh and Tesvin, which did not necessitate an order for sentences to run consecutively. The two terms of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently resulting in a total sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment which in my view is neither manifestly excessive nor inadequate.
