\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9194/2022/01.\]

28 October 2022

### Principal District Judge Toh Han Li:

## Introduction

1       The accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 5(3) of the Payment Services Act 2019 (“PSA”) as follows:

> You…are charged that you, between 03 February 2020 and 28 June 2020, at East Village Pte. Ltd., located at No. 111 North Bridge Road, #03-03 Peninsula Plaza, Singapore, did carry on a business of providing a payment service in Singapore without a licence, to wit, you provided cross-border money transfer services by receiving a sum of about S$10,123.20 and arranging for the money to be transmitted to persons in Myanmar, when you did not have in force a valid licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore for the provision of such payment service, and when you were not an exempt payment service provider, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1) and punishable under Section 5(3)(a) of the Payment Services Act 2019.

2       Section 5(3)(a) PSA provides that the punishment for an offence under s 5(1) PSA in the case of an individual is a fine not exceeding $125,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $12,500 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction.

3       The following charge under s 6(1) of the Money-Changing & Remittance Business Act, Cap 187 (“MCRBA”) was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:

> You…are charged that you, between 17 November 2019 and 21 January 2020, did carry on a remittance business at East Village Pte. Ltd., located at No. 111 North Bridge Road, #03-03 Peninsula Plaza, Singapore, when you were not in possession of a valid remittance licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 6(1) of the Money-Changing & Remittance Businesses Act, Chapter 187 and punishable under Section 6(2) of the said Act.

## Statement of Facts

4       The accused is a 49-year-old male Myanmar National and a Singapore Permanent Resident.

5       The accused was the owner and director of East Village Pte Ltd (“the Company”). The Company was involved in the business of importing medicinal products from India and selling international calling cards. The Company operated a shopfront at 111 North Bridge Road #0303, Peninsula Plaza. At the material time, the Company employed one Soe Soe Aye (“Soe”) at the shopfront.

6       On 28 June 2020, the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) carried out an operation targeting unlicenced remittance activities. During the operation, CAD officers observed two customers at the Company’s shopfront attended to by Soe. Upon confronting them, it was established that the two customers were at the Company to remit monies to their families in Myanmar.

7       The accused started to provide remittance services to his customers as customers used to approach the Company to ask about such services. Initially, the accused would tell the customers that the Company did not provide remittance services. As some of the customers did not know how to fill up the necessary paperwork for remittance at the licenced remittance agents, the accused would help them to fill up the forms.

8       Subsequently, the accused decided to provide his own remittance service as customers continued to approach Company to ask about it. In carrying out the remittance service, the accused enlisted the aid of his nephew, Kyaw Min Tun (“Sona”), who was based in Myanmar.

9       The remittance service provided by the accused operated as follows:

> a.     The accused would set the exchange rate by taking reference from the rates offered by the DBS iRemit and Singtel Dash services, as these were commonly used remittance services by Myanmar Nationals in Singapore. The accused would set the rate in between those offered by these services and inform Soe of the exchange rate.

> b.     Soe would deal with the customers who came to the Company’s shopfront. She collected the money in Singapore Dollars from customers who intended to remit monies to Myanmar and issued receipts to them. She would then record the details in an Excel spreadsheet which she uploaded to the Google Drive file-sharing service.

> c.     Sona would access the spreadsheet on Google Drive and made arrangements for the money (Myanmar Kyats) to be transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries or to be delivered in cash to them if they did not have bank accounts.

> d.     The accused would use the Singapore Dollars collected to buy goods in Singapore that Sona’s customers required and ship them to Sona in Myanmar.

10     The accused would usually provide remittance services on Sundays. The customers were primarily foreign workers from Myanmar working in Singapore. In providing the service, the accused charged a fee of $2 to $10 for each transaction. On top of this, the accused would also charge the customers a bank charge of between $1 to $3, dependent on the bank fees incurred in Myanmar for making bank transfers. Where the customers needed to call their families in Myanmar to obtain details of the beneficiaries, the accused would charge them for the international calling card.

11     The accused had thus provided a cross-border money transfer service as defined in s 2 read with the First Schedule to the PSA.

12     The accused started providing the remittance service sometime in 2018. Between 3 February 2020 to 28 June 2020, the accused collected a sum of about $10,123.20 which was remitted to Myanmar. Based on the Company’s records, the accused earned a service fee of $80 from those transactions.

## Antecedent

13     The accused was traced for an unrelated offence for the possession of uncensored films under s 21(1)(a) Films Act (Chapter 107) for which he was fined $12,000 on 31 August 2004. A charge of carrying on a business of importing films without a licence under s 6(1)(a) Films Act (Chapter 107) was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

14     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least three weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted the primary sentencing consideration for an offence under s 5 PSA was deterrence. The Prosecution referred to the speech of Minister Ong Ye Kung delivered on 14 January 2019 at the Second Reading of the Payment Services Bill, where he highlighted as follows:

> The second risk is that payment services may be used for ML/TF \[note: refers to money laundering and terrorism financing\], such as through illicit cross border transfers, anonymous cash-based payment transactions, structuring of payments to avoid reporting thresholds or the raising or layering of assets or funds for ML/TF purposes. MAS studies the business model of each payment service to determine where regulatory measures should be imposed. The appropriate AML/CFT \[note: refers to anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism\] requirements will be imposed on relevant licensees through Notices issued under the MAS Act. MAS will also provide guidance to the industry.

15     The Prosecution submitted that abuse of payment services for nefarious purposes clearly affected the delivery of financial services and the integrity of the economic infrastructure. General deterrence must thus assume significance in the sentencing calculus: _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[24(e)\].

16     The Prosecution submitted that the sentencing trend for cases under the MCRBA should not continue to be followed for an offence under s. 5(3)(a) of the PSA, for three reasons.

17     Firstly, the sentencing of offences under the MCRBA has not been considered by the High Court. The only known High Court decision, _Chinpo Shipping Co (Pte) Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 983</span> (“_Chinpo Shipping_”), offered no guidance as it involved a company and as such there was no issue of a custodial sentences being considered in that case.

18     Secondly, the usual sentences meted out under the MCRBA did not appear to have fully utilized the full spectrum of the sentencing range under s 6 MCRBA. Section 6 MCRBA prescribed a punishment of up to $100,000 fine and/or imprisonment up to two years, with a further fine of up to $10,000 for every day the offence continues after conviction. The Prosecution submitted that when the MCRBA was first enacted in 1985, the prescribed punishment was up to $5,000 fine and/or six months’ imprisonment, without provision for a continuing offence. In 1996, it was amended to up to $50,000 fine and/or two years’ imprisonment, with an additional fine of up to $1,000 for every day that the offence continued after conviction.

19     A survey of the cases under s 6 MCRBA (extracted from the Sentencing Information and Research Repository covering the period from 22 October 2001 to 7 December 2022) showed that:

> a.     The majority of cases were punished with fines (24 out of 33 cases, or about 72.73%);

> b.     The fines were clustered at the lower end of the range, with 18 of 24 cases (75%) involving fines of $30,000 or less; and

> c.     There were no cases punished with fines only where the fine exceeded $50,000, in other words, the fines did not exceed half the prescribed range.

20     The Prosecution referred to _Ong Chee Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 776</span> where the High Court opined at \[24\] as follows:

> …where Parliament has enacted a range of possible sentences, it is the duty of the court to ensure that the full spectrum is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence. Where benchmarks harden into rigid formulae which suggest that only a segment of the possible sentencing range should be applied by the court, there is a risk that the court might inadvertently usurp the legislative function.

21     In the circumstances, the Prosecution submitted that given the clustering of sentences at the lower end of the sentencing spectrum (even for cases involving fines only), the sentences imposed under s 6 MCRBA did not appear to have utilized the full sentencing spectrum, and thus, should not continue to guide sentencing for s 5(3) PSA offences.

22     Thirdly, the Prosecution submitted that specifically in relation to offences under s 6 MCRBA, the High Court had taken the view that illegal remittance service offences require a substantial custodial sentence, even for first time offenders. This was observed by District Judge Audrey Lim (as she then was) in _PP v Shahabudeen s/o Asappa Abdul Hussain_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 122</span> _(“Shahabudeen”_), referring to two criminal revisions in the High Court, namely _PP v Mohideen Kunji Mohamed Rafi_ (CR 16/2002) and _PP v Mohd Ziard Mohd Zarook_ (CR 17/2002), where the sentences were increased from a fine of $15,000 to 3 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $10,000. The Prosecution submitted that it was pertinent to note that in those High Court cases, substantial custodial terms were imposed even though the facts before the court did not disclose that the illegal remittance service providers had dealt with criminal proceeds.

23     In the circumstances, the Prosecution submitted that the court should consider the sentence for the present offence under s 5(3) PSA without being constrained by the sentencing trend for cases under s 6 MCRBA.

24     The Prosecution submitted a table of precedents under s 5 PSA for comparison.

25     The Prosecution conceded that the present case was less aggravated compared to the other two precedent cases cited in the table. While the accused in the present carried out transactions for a longer period of time, the amount he remitted, and the financial benefit he received was lower than the two precedent cases. Also, unlike _Chen Jiantao_, the monies remitted in the present case did not include criminal proceeds.

26     While there had been one reported decision under s 5(3) PSA which was the case of _PP v Lange Vivian_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 11</span> (“_Lange Vivian”)_, the Prosecution did not rely on _Lange Vivian_ as a sentencing precedent given the difference in the type of payment service in that case. The Prosecution submitted that each payment service as set out in the PSA would present its own unique set of circumstances as well as the risks of the service being utilised for money laundering, and so should be considered separately from each other.

27     The Prosecution accordingly submitted that the appropriate sentence in the present case should thus be below those imposed in the two precedent cases, and a sentence of at least three weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate in the circumstances and reflected the longer period of offending in the present case.

## Mitigation

28     The Defence sought a fine of $8,000.

29     The accused was a Myanmar Citizen by birth and a Singapore Permanent Resident. He had been living in Singapore since 1997, when he first came to Singapore as a student.

30     The accused was in the trading business, including export of goods to Myanmar, which includes the export of handphones, refrigerators, compressors and other small items. As it was not easy for small businesses to remit money to Singapore, it had been a practice for many Myanmar businesses to collect monies in Singapore from workers and use the monies to buy goods for export to Myanmar. The Myanmar businesses who imported the goods into Singapore, would, instead of remitting monies for the payment of the goods imported from Myanmar, would get the Myanmar exporter to pay the purchase price of goods by paying to the Myanmar workers’ family in Myanmar at the direction of the Myanmar businesses. This system had been practiced by many Myanmar business persons in Singapore.

31     The particulars of the workers including domestic workers would be recorded and there was no issue of the identity of the workers and the source of monies which the accused had collected.

32     The Defence submitted that many Myanmar workers working in Singapore had families who lived in the outskirts or rural areas of Myanmar where there were no banking facilities. The family members of most of these workers did not have bank accounts. Some Myanmar workers of Muslim descent had difficulty opening bank accounts in Myanmar.

33     These workers would have to send monies to Myanmar every month, or else their family members would not have food to eat. Unlike other ASEAN countries, it was difficult to send monies to rural areas of Myanmar. Prior to the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021, United Overseas Bank and Western Union had some presence in Myanmar. While the workers could send monies through financial institutions, they did not have presence in rural areas and outskirts. This would mean that their family members would have to travel a whole day or many hours from their homes to reach the financial institutions in Myanmar to collect the monies sent by the workers in Singapore. Further, in order to collect monies from the financial institutions, the family members would need identity documents to collect the monies and not all Myanmar nationals have proper identification documents. As such, these workers approach Myanmar businesses in Singapore to help them remit monies to Myanmar.

34     Although the accused was not in the money remittance business, he accepted monies from workers for the purpose of remitting the monies to their families in Myanmar.

35     It was estimated that there were approximately 200,000 Myanmar Nationals living in Singapore. A large majority of them were employed as domestic helpers and low-skilled workers. Most of these Myanmar Nationals remitted their earnings to their homeland in Myanmar mainly through unlicensed persons or companies.

36     Further, the COVID-19 pandemic had worsened the situation as workers could not send monies during the nationwide circuit breaker. Banks and remittance operators in the Peninsula Plaza vicinity were considered non-essential services during the Covid 19 Pandemic and had to closed under the Covid 19 regulations. During peak of Covid-19 Pandemic in early 2020, many Myanmar nationals in Singapore found it hard to remit monies to Myanmar. Some of them had to send monies for their loved ones to purchase oxygen tanks, medical supplies, and for their daily expenses. As there were few options to send monies to Myanmar, Myanmar Nationals turned to traders like the accused to help facilitate the transfer of monies.

37     As a former migrant himself in Singapore, the accused was able to relate to the workers’ plight and felt a sense of comradeship in aiding his fellow countrymen in desperate times.

38     While the accused was charging for his services, the Defence submitted that he was helping his fellow countrymen to remit monies to their families. The remitting of monies was not his main source of income, and the fees payable was indeed minimal just to cover his administrative costs.

39     The period in which the accused had committed the offence was about five months, between 3 February 2020 – 28 June 2020. The accused was only collecting monies during Sunday to cater to the migrant community.

40     The Defence summarised the following relevant facts as applicable to the offence specific factors of harm and culpability.

41     In terms of offender specific factors, the Defence conceded that while there was a charge under s 6(1) MCRBA which had been taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, the accused was a first offender in so far as the current offences were concerned. He had pleaded guilty, cooperated with the authorities and there was no loss of monies to the customers.

42     The Defence submitted that both _Lange Vivian_ and _Chen Jiantao_ involved the transfer of criminal proceeds; and in _Lange Vivian_ and _Rus Hayati_ the offenders took steps to avoid detection for their offences.

43     The Defence submitted that the transactions did not involve criminal proceeds nor were they from illegal gains and he had never taken steps to avoid detection. As mentioned earlier, the monies were from genuine workers that remitted monies to sustain their families’ livelihood back in Myanmar.

44     The Defence accordingly submitted that a fine of $8,000 was appropriate in the circumstances.

## The Court’s Decision on Sentence

### Background to the enactment of the Payment Services Act

45     The PSA is a new Act and came into force on 28 January 2020. It combined the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act and Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act into a single Act.

46     In this regard, I set out the relevant portions of Minister Ong Ye Kung’s speech at the Second Reading speech of the Payment Services Bill on 14 January 2019 as follows:

> 2    Technology is transforming the world of payments. In particular, FinTech, or Financial Technology, has opened up opportunities for more convenient, faster and cheaper payments.

> 3    At the same time, new payment methods give rise to new risks. This has necessitated a review of our regulatory framework. Further, services that were previously provided separately and regulated separately are now merging.

> 5    The Payment Services Bill provides a forward looking and flexible framework for the regulation of payment systems and payment service providers in Singapore. It provides for regulatory certainty and consumer safeguards, while encouraging innovation and growth of payment services and FinTech.

> 7…    we are adopting a regulatory structure that recognises the growing convergence across payment activities which I just mentioned. For example, payment and remittance services are now often provided as one product to customers.

> 15    The services can be grouped into seven types: account issuance, domestic money transfers, cross-border money transfers, merchant acquisition, e-money issuance, digital payment token dealing and exchanges, and money-changing.

> 16    Service providers may offer different combinations of these services, and the licensing regime will regulate them according to the risks they pose.

> 22    Further, under the Bill, we will regulate inward remittance services in addition to outbound remittance services that are currently regulated

> 27... payment services may be used for ML/TF \[note: refers to money laundering and terrorism financing\], such as through illicit cross border transfers, anonymous cash-based payment transactions, structuring of payments to avoid reporting thresholds or the raising or layering of assets or funds for ML/TF purposes. MAS studies the business model of each payment service to determine where regulatory measures should be imposed. The appropriate AML/CFT requirements \[note: refers to anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism\] will be imposed on relevant licensees through Notices issued under the MAS Act. MAS will also provide guidance to the industry.

47     The objectives of the PSA were outlined by the District Judge in _Lange Vivian_ at \[10\] to \[13\] as follows:

> It would be relevant to set out the legislative background behind the PSA. The PSA was enacted on 14 January 2019 to streamline payment services under a single legislation by consolidating the Money-changing and Remittance Businesses Act (Cap 187, 2008 Rev Ed) and the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act (Cap 222A, 2007 Rev Ed) and to take into account new developments in financial technology (“FinTech”) by expanding the scope of regulated payment services. The PSA empowers the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) to regulate payment services to address the following key risks and concerns:

>> (a)    loss of customers’ moneys such as when a service provider becomes insolvent;

>> (b)    money-laundering and terrorism financing;

>> (c)    fragmentation and limitations to interoperability across payment solutions; and

>> (d)    technology including cyber risks

> The PSA provides for two parallel regulatory frameworks:

>> (a)    a designation regime that enables MAS to designate systemically important payment systems and regulate the operators and institutions of these payment systems for financial stability and efficiency;

>> (b)    a licencing regime which is activity-based that enables MAS to regulate retail payment services provided to customers and merchants.

> The PSA regulates seven payment services which are: i) account issuances, ii) domestic money transfers, iii) international money transfers, iv) merchant acquisition, v) money-changing, vi) e-money issuance and vii) digital payment token (see First Schedule to the PSA). E-money issuance and digital payment token services (more commonly known as cryptocurrency dealing or exchange services) fall under the expanded scope of the licencing regime to encompass services associated with virtual assets and currencies. Offences under s 5 of the PSA would come under the licencing regime.

> Thus, the PSA came into force on 28 January 2020 to enhance the regulatory framework for payment services in Singapore, increase consumer protection and raise confidence in the use of epayments.

48     To summarise, the PSA was meant to enhance the regulatory framework for payment services in Singapore, increase consumer protection and raise confidence in the use of e-payments. To this end, cross-border money transfers were one of the payment services to be licensed and regulated with key risks identified which included the loss of customers’ moneys when a service provider became insolvent as well as money-laundering and terrorism financing.

### Dominant sentencing principle

49     In _Chinpo Shipping_, the High Court held at \[116\] that general deterrence was the main consideration for a charge under s 6 MCRBA:

> We agree with the DJ that general deterrence is the main sentencing consideration for the MCRBA Charge. The objective of the system of licensing under the MCRBA is to bring all persons providing remittance services within the ambit of certain minimum legal and regulatory requirements and the supervision of MAS. Licensees are expected to put in place appropriate systems and perform relevant customer due diligence measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.

50     In my view, the High Court’s observations in _Chinpo Shipping_ on the provision of remittance services under s 6(1) MCRBA would be applicable to offences such as the present offence under s 5(3) PSA which similarly involved the provision of remittance services. Further, the charge which has been taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing in the present case was one under s 6(1) MCRBA.

51     As noted in _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[24(e)\], the abuse of payment services for nefarious purposes clearly affected the delivery of financial services and the integrity of the economic infrastructure. General deterrence must thus assume significance in the sentencing calculus. In my judgment, offences under s 5(3) PSA such as the present one were concerned with the provision of payment services outside of the licensing regime of the PSA, thus affecting the integrity of the licensing regime itself.

52     In this regard, I respectively agree with the District Judge in _Lange Vivian_ who held at \[14\] as follows:

> .. the PSA is concerned with preventing an unregulated shadow financial system, **irrespective of whether criminal proceeds are involved or not.** \[emphasis added\]

53     In the circumstances, I was of the view that the dominant sentencing principle for an offence under s 5(3) PSA was general deterrence.

### Relevance of MCRBA precedents

54     One issue that arose was whether case precedents under the now repealed MCRBA were helpful in determining a sentence for an offence under s 5 PSA. In this regard, it should be noted while there have been unreported decisions under the previous MCRBA where fines have been meted out, given that they were unreported decisions, I was unable to give them much weight as it was not possible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge in those cases, see _PP v Mahadi bin Muhamad Mukhtar_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 217</span> per Hoong J at \[7\].

55     As highlighted by the Minister at the Second Reading of the Payment Services Bill, the PSA combined the Payment Systems (Oversight) Act and MCRBA into a single Act, given considerations such as new technologies, convergence of payment methods and illicit cross border transfers such that cross-border money transfers were to be specifically regulated. In my judgment, case precedents on the now repealed MCRBA may therefore not be entirely relevant for offences with the Payment Services Act.

56     Notably, in _PP v Tan Khoon Yong_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGMC 43</span>, the District Judge took the same view and held at \[47\] as follows:

> I agree with the Prosecution that the sentencing precedents under the repealed Money Changing and Remittance Business Act 1979 (''MCRBA'') should not be relied upon in sentencing for the PSA offences and would associate myself with the sound reasoning of the learned District Judge in PP v Chen Jiantao (at \[2\]). In my judgment, the more recent PSA sentencing precedents were more relevant to the present case, as compared to the more outdated MCRBA precedents.

57     In _Chen Jiantao_, the District Judge held at \[2\] to \[3\] of his oral judgment as follows:

> I agree with the Prosecution that there is a sound basis for the Court not to rely on the now repealed Money-Changing and Remittance Businesses Act 1979 (“MCRBA”) precedents when sentencing an offender under s 5(3) of the Payment Services Act 2019 (“PSA”), for the reasons cited in the Prosecution’s supplementary sentencing submissions dated 25 Oct 2021 (“the Prosecution’s Supplementary Submissions”); namely:

>> (a)    First, there is no High Court guidance (in any reported judgment) on the appropriate sentencing approach for a s 6 MCRBA offence.

>> (b)    Second, the sentences meted out in the past two decades under the MCRBA have congregated in the lower range of the sentencing spectrum that extends up to 2 years’ imprisonment. No explanation appears to have been provided on why this is satisfactory or justifiable.

>> (c)    Third, the precedents after 2003 do not appear to have taken into account the sentences imposed by the High Court in PP v Mohideen Kunji Mohamed Rafi (CR 16 of 2002) and PP v Mohd Ziard Mohd Zarook (CR 17 of 2002); and also the decision of DJ Audrey Lim (as she then was) in PP v Shahabudeen s/o Asappa Abdul Hussain <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 122</span>.

> Given the problems highlighted of the precedents under the MCRBA, I am of the view that it will not be appropriate for this Court to simply apply a percentage increase in the sentence to be imposed for the offence under s 5(3) PSA as that would assume that the general range of sentences imposed under the MCRBA previously is persuasive and should continue to carry weight. While it is not clear from the Parliamentary speeches what Parliament had thought of the previous precedents under the MCRBA, what is clear is that Parliament was concerned that the rise of Fintech could lead to a proliferation of money laundering or terrorism-related offences. In that regard, the Prosecution’s position that the ease in which such offences can now be committed given the advance in technology – ie, by just a few clicks on a person’s phone – should warrant a deterrent punishment is a position I find persuasive, especially when one considers the increased prevalence of financial scams in the last few years (see Prosecution’s sentencing submissions dated 27 September 2021 at \[12\]).

58     That said, it should be noted that custodial sentences _had in fact_ been meted out for offences of carrying on a remittance business without a licence under the MCRBA for first offenders where there was no loss to customers or criminal proceeds involved.

59     In this regard, I referred to the reported decision of _Shahabudeen_ where District Judge Audrey Lim (as she then was) observed at \[14\] and \[16\] of her Grounds of Decision as follows:

> As for the offence of carrying on a remittance business without a valid licence, **the recent High Court decisions have shown that a custodial term is imposed even for first offenders**. In PP v Mohideen Kunji Mohamed Rafi and PP v Mohd Ziard Mohd Zarook, the period in which the accused carried on the business on the remittance business was between one and a half to two years. **They were first offenders, and no loss was caused to the businesses of the clients. Yet, the High Court imposed a sentenced of three months' imprisonment in addition to a $10,000 fine**. A similar sentence was imposed in PP v Mohamed Junid (CR3/03) although the period in which the accused carried on the money changing business without a licence was less than a year and there was no evidence of any loss caused. The accused in all these cases had also pleaded guilty. **Hence the mere fact that no loss was caused to the customers or businesses in the present case, was not a factor which would warrant a departure from the custodial norm set by the High Court**.

> ...

> **Moreover the regulation and licensing of such activities are important to protect the public who use these services and ultimately to save \[sic\] guard and uphold the integrity of the Singapore financial system.**

> \[emphasis added\]

### Offence and offender specific factors

60     The District Judge in _Lange Vivian_ declined to adopt the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing framework for an offence under s 5(3) PSA as she was of the view that the High Court was the more appropriate forum to establish such a framework. That said, I found the offence and offender specific factors in relation to a s 5 PSA offence as set out at \[22\] of her Grounds of Decision as a useful guide for consideration of the appropriate sentence in the present case. I accordingly set these out as follows:

61     In terms of offence specific factors, I found the following factors going towards harm as relevant:

62     By providing a cross-border money transfer service, there was a transnational element to the offence. In _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 609</span> (“_Logachev”)_ Menon CJ observed at \[55\] as follows:

> **Similarly, the court in** **_Yongyut_** **(\[17\]** **_supra_** **) regarded (at \[190(i)\]) the transnational element in that case as one of the factors which pointed in favour of a deterrent sentence**, and the District Judge also took this into account in her analysis (see the GD at \[22\], \[26\] and \[30\]). **Among other things, the involvement of a transnational element aggravates an offence because of the increased difficulties that this presents to law enforcement**. In addition, the transnational element usually means that crime is being imported, so to speak, into Singapore. This raises concerns over the permeation of criminality within our borders and, possibly, even the recruitment of locals into transnational criminal enterprises.

\[emphasis added\]

63     In my view, given that the PSA regulated domestic money transfers and cross border money transfers as separate services (see paragraph 15 of the Minister’s speech as set out above at \[46\]), on the authority of _Logachev_, cross-border money transfers aggravated the offence and hence warranted a deterrent sentence.

64     A total sum of $10,123.20 cross-border transfers was involved. This amount was more than the amount in _Lange Vivian_ which was $3,350 but less than the amount of $40,195.54 in _Rus Hayati_.

65     In terms of offence specific factors, I found the following factors going towards culpability as relevant:

66     The accused was running the remittance services on a commercial basis. In providing the service, the accused charged a fee of $2 to $10 for each transaction. On top of this, the accused would also charge the customers a bank charge of between $1 to $3, dependent on the bank fees incurred in Myanmar for making bank transfers. The accused earned a commission of $80. The provision of the unlicensed remittance service also benefited his main business. For example, where the customers needed to call their families in Myanmar to obtain details of the beneficiaries, the accused would also charge them for the international calling card for which he was selling as a main business.

67     The period of offending in the proceeded charge was for a period of close to five months.

68     In terms of offender specific factors, I found the following factors relevant:

69     There was another charge under s 6(1) MCRBA for carrying on a remittance business without a valid licence which has been taken into consideration for sentencing where the duration of offending was for a period of over 2 months (from 17 November 2019 to 21 January 2020) which immediately preceded the period in the proceeded charge (from 3 February 2020 to 28 June 2020). The accused could not be charged under s 5(3) PSA as the PSA only came into effect on 28 January 2020.

70     I turned to the Defence's submission on the poor financial infrastructure in Myanmar such that if a person were to send monies from Singapore to Myanmar by legal means, their family members would have to travel a whole day or many hours from their homes to reach the financial institutions in Myanmar to collect the monies sent by the workers in Singapore. With respect, whatever shortcomings there may have been in Myanmar’s financial system or inconveniences occasioned to collect monies remitted through licensed service providers, that cannot be used to justify the operation of an unregulated and illegal shadow financial system with the reputational impact that this would have on the integrity of Singapore's financial system. In this regard, the accused and the Company being unlicensed, would not have been subject to anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism requirements that would have been imposed on relevant licensees (see paragraph 27 of the Minister’s speech above at \[46\]). Further, as noted at \[16\] in _Shahabudeen_, the regulation and licensing of activities such as remittance services were important to protect the public who used these services and ultimately to safeguard and uphold the integrity of Singapore’s financial system.

71     The Defence’s own submission was that most of the 200,000 Myanmar Nationals in Singapore remitted their earnings to their homeland in Myanmar mainly through unlicensed persons or companies like the accused to help facilitate the transfer of monies to Myanmar. As such, the practice of providing such illegal remittances appeared to be widespread among the Myanmar community in Singapore which all the more required a need to deter like-minded persons from providing such unlicensed remittance services. Indeed, the accused’s activities were uncovered and only ceased as a result of the CAD operation targeting unlicensed remittance activities on 28 June 2020, the end date as stated in the charge.

72     In mitigation, I noted that the accused had pleaded guilty.

73     Next, I considered as to whether the custodial threshold had been crossed in the present case. As earlier noted in _Shahabudeen_, custodial terms had been imposed in the High Court where there was no loss caused nor did the facts disclose that monies remitted were tainted or that there were criminal proceeds involved. In _PP v Mohideen Kunji Mohamed Rafi (“Mohideen Kunji”)_ which was a case cited in _Shahabudeen_, the Statement of Facts simply stated as follows:

> HRT operates an import and export business via Sri Lank and Singapore. The company is not licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) to conduct remittance business.

> Investigation revealed that for the period between 17 March 2000 and 26 February 2002, the defendant, whilst in the capacity of a Partner of HRT, had been proving remittance to one Goh Teong Seng, a money changer from Malaysia, who wanted to remit monies to locations outside Singapore. The defendant has knowledge that he has no license to provide such remittance service to Goh Teong Seng.

74     The High Court imposed a sentence of $10,000 and three months’ imprisonment.

75     The relevant portions of the Statement of Facts in _Mohd Ziard Mohd Zarook_ (also cited in _Shahabudeen_) was similarly brief:

> Between 2 January 2021 and 21 October 2001, the defendant had been providing remittance services to its regular clients and customers by remitting funds to locations outside Singapore without a valid remittance issued by the MAS.

76     The High Court imposed a sentence of $10,000 and three months’ imprisonment.

77     At the same time, I noted that the periods of offending in _Mohideen Kunji_ and _Mohd Ziard Mohd Zarook_ were longer than the present case, namely close to two years for _Mohideen Kunji_ and ten months for _Mohd Ziard Mohd Zarook_.

78     In _Lange Vivian_, a sentence of four weeks' imprisonment for an offence under s 5 PSA involving a transnational remittance of $3,350 of which $2,200 was established to be transferred from scam victims.

79     In _Rus Hayati_ a sentence of nine weeks' imprisonment for an offence under s 5 PSA was imposed for an amount of transnational remittance totalling $40,191.54 for which the offender was remunerated $190 where there was no amount traceable to criminal conduct. While _Rus Hayati_ was an unreported decision, I noted from the sentencing remarks of the District Judge in _Rus Hayati_ that she did articulate her reasons for the custodial sentence as follows:

> In sentencing you, the court noted in your favour your timely plea of guilt, as well as the fact that you did not have any criminal records. Against this backdrop, you cannot be described as a first offender in respect of the offence of providing unlicensed money transfer services, given that you had carried out a substantial number of unlicensed remittances of monies since July 2019. **This sustained pattern of offending conduct heightens the measure of your culpability**.

> Equally relevant is the fact that the present offence involved a considerable number of transactions over the course of a month from Jan 2020 to Feb 2020. The fact that you did accrue personal financial benefit is a relevant sentencing consideration.

> Equally aggravating was your conduct upon the offence being uncovered, namely, the concerted efforts taken by you to thwart investigations by concealing and removing all documentary trails. Deterrence is the key consideration underpinning the enactment of the Payment Services Act.

> **The court agreed with the prosecution that the custodial threshold has been crossed in the present case. To your credit, the court noted that there was no evidence of money laundering and financing of terrorism involved in the cross-border money transfers, unlike the reported case of Lange Vivian.**

\[emphasis added\]

80     What was relevant from _Rus Hayati_ was that like the present case, there was no evidence of money laundering and financing of terrorism involved in the cross-border money transfers which was carried on for a sustained period, but the District Judge nonetheless held that the custodial threshold had been crossed.

### Conclusion on sentence

81     In considering the appropriate sentence for the s 5(3) PSA offence, I took into account the following factors:

> a)     Deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle;

> b)     There was a need to deter like-minded persons from offering unlicensed cross-border remittance services which would not have been subject to anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism requirements that would have been imposed on relevant licensees;

> c)     The duration of the accused carrying on his cross-border remittance services was close to five months and the accused’s activities only ceased because of the CAD operation;

> d)     A total amount of $10,123.20 was remitted to Myanmar;

> e)     The accused ran the remittance services commercially which also benefited his main businesses and earned a commission of $80; and

> f)     A similar charge under s 6(1) MCRBA was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing with a period of offending of over two months.

82     If we were to include the two month period of offending under the MCRBA (as s 5(3) PSA only come into force 28 January 2020, the accused had to be charged under s 6(1) MCRBA for the period 17 November 2019 to 21 January 2020), the total period of offending would be seven months. A period of seven months could not be said to be a short duration. Further, the Statement of Facts stated the accused started providing remittance services sometime in 2018. As a mitigating factor, I took into consideration his plea of guilt. I also noted that the facts were somewhat less aggravated than that in _Rus Hayati_.

83     In the circumstances, notwithstanding that lack of an additional factor that criminal proceeds were involved, with general deterrence as the dominant sentencing consideration and given the other factors I have highlighted above, I was not able to say that the level of the accused's harm and culpability ranked at the lowest end of the spectrum so as to simply warrant a fine.

84     All things considered, I was of the view that a short custodial term was merited and I imposed a sentence of two weeks' imprisonment.

85     The accused is on bail pending his appeal.
