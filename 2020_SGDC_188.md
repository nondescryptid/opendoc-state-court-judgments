### Deputy Registrar Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       This was an application by the defendant to stay the proceedings in DC/DC 1457/2019 (“the Suit”) on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_. After hearing parties’ submissions on 4 August 2020, I ordered the matter to be stayed with brief oral reasons.

2       The plaintiff has appealed against my decision on 12 August 2020. I now set out below in full my grounds of decision.

## Factual background

### Undisputed facts

3       The plaintiff and defendant (“the Parties”) are former spouses. They were married in 1978 and their marriage was dissolved in 2003.

4       In the course of their marriage, the Parties had incorporated a company in Malaysia, VGC (M) Sdn Bhd (“VGC”) sometime in or around 1993. Both Parties were directors and shareholders of VGC and were actively involved in managing its business.

5       The defendant’s relatives, Mr Chai Ah Tong (“Chai”) and Mdm Heng Bak Kee (“Heng”), were also appointed as shareholders and directors of VGC to comply with the relevant regulations under Malaysian law. However, Chai and Heng neither invested nor managed VGC at any point in time.

6       As a result, the Parties, Chai and Heng had orally agreed that the dividends paid to Chai and Heng for their respective shares in VGC were to be returned to the Parties whereupon the Parties would share it equally (“the Agreement”). These dividends were all paid in Malaysian Ringgit (“RM”).

7       The mechanics of the Agreement was as follows. The cheques issued by VGC to Chai and Heng would be initially deposited in the joint savings account of Chai and Heng (“the Account”) at Citibank Berhad, Johore Bahru, Malaysia (“Citibank Malaysia”). On each occasion, the Parties would then separately accompany Chai and Heng to Citibank Malaysia to withdraw their respective equal shares of the dividends in the Account.

8       After the dissolution of the marriage, the Parties decided to unwind the affairs of VGC.

9       Following that, on 28 and 30 May 2013, Chai, Heng and the defendant visited a branch at Citibank Malaysia and withdrew VGC dividends amounting to 444,000RM from the Account (“the Disputed Withdrawals”). It was not in dispute that the plaintiff was not present during the Disputed Withdrawals.

### Material factual dispute

10     The Parties critically differed on who retained the Disputed Withdrawals. The defendant’s version was that Chai had retained from the Disputed Withdrawals the relevant share of the plaintiff, _ie_, 222,000RM, in order to pass it to the plaintiff. He relied in this regard on a payment voucher dated 30 May 2013 (“the Voucher”), which appeared to be signed by Chai, as proof of receipt of 220,000RM.

11     On the other hand, the plaintiff, Chai and Heng claimed that the defendant kept the entire 444,000RM from the Disputed Withdrawals. This allegation formed the basis of the plaintiff’s claim in the Suit, alleging breach of the Agreement by the defendant in relation to the sharing of profits in VGC.

12     Further, Chai claimed that the Voucher was forged. In this connection, the plaintiff had commissioned a handwriting expert, Ms Shikshita Khanna (“the Handwriting Expert”), whose opinion is that Chai’s signature on the Voucher was forged.

## The Parties’ cases

13     In support of its application for stay on the ground of _forum non conveniens_, the defendant submitted that Malaysia is the more appropriate forum for the dispute in the Suit to be resolved. The main reasons relied on were as follows:

> (a)     the events giving rise to the Disputed Withdrawals took place in Malaysia and therefore the cause of action arose in Malaysia;

> (b)     the evidence of Citibank Malaysia is crucial as to the bank’s practice of who they typically hand the money withdrawn to;

> (c)     the named account holders of the Account, namely Heng and Chai, are Malaysian citizens and they are based in Malaysia; and

> (d)     the sums of money forming the Disputed Withdrawals originated from a Malaysian company, _ie_, VGC, which carried on the business in Malaysia.

14     The plaintiff submitted that Singapore is the more appropriate and natural forum because the Parties are both Singaporeans, their dissolution and division of matrimonial assets took place in Singapore, police reports were made in Singapore on the alleged forgery of the Voucher and the Handwriting Expert is based in Singapore.

## The applicable legal principles

15     It was not in dispute between the Parties that the governing test for applications for stay on ground of _forum non conveniens_ is that laid down in the House of Lords decision in _Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] AC 460</span> (“_Spiliada_”). The test in _Spiliada_ has been consistently applied by the Singapore courts (see _JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 391</span> (“_JIO Minerals_”) at \[38\]). The test in _Spiliada_ is a two-stage test.

16     At the first stage (“Stage 1”), the court considers whether there is another forum that is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore for the trial of the substantive dispute between the parties (see _Spiliada_ at 477). To determine this, the court undertakes an assessment of where the factors demonstrating a real and substantial connection point to. In this regard, a non-exhaustive list of five factors have been identified by the Court of Appeal (see _JIO Minerals_ at \[41\]–\[42\] and _Rappo, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 265</span> (“_Rappo, Tania_”) at \[71\]):

> (a)     the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses;

> (b)     the connections to relevant events and transactions;

> (c)     the applicable law to the dispute;

> (d)     the existence of proceedings elsewhere (_ie_, _lis alibi pendens_); and

> (e)     the “shape of the litigation” (_ie_, the manner in which the claim and the defence have been pleaded).

17     It is also trite law that the merits of the case will not be a relevant factor when considering whether the doctrine of _forum non conveniens_ could be invoked (see _The “Rainbow Joy”_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 719</span> at \[27\]). Further, it is the _quality_ of the connecting factors that is determinative in the analysis under Stage 1, rather than the quantity of factors on each side of the scale (see _Rappo, Tania_ at \[70\]). In essence, the test is to ascertain which is the more _appropriate_ forum; not simply which is the more convenient forum (see _JIO Minerals_ at \[41\]). The burden of establishing this rests on the applicant for the stay.

18     At the second stage (“Stage 2”), once a forum is determined, the court considers if there are any reasons indicating that a stay should or should not be granted for reasons of justice. If the court concludes that _prima facie_ another forum is clearly or distinctly more appropriate for the trial of the action, a stay would be granted unless there are special circumstances to warrant the exercise of its discretion to stay. Here, the burden of establishing the existence of such circumstances lies on the respondent resisting the stay.

19     I turn now to the facts before me.

## Application to the facts

### Stage 1

20     Under Stage 1, I found that the defendant had discharged her burden of showing that Malaysia is clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum than Singapore for the trial of the Suit for the following reasons:

> (a)     the business venture, VGC, (which gave rise to the Disputed Withdrawals) was set up in Malaysia and there was no evidence before me that VGC’s business extended to Singapore;

> (b)     the VGC dividends were paid into the Account, which was a Malaysian bank account;

> (c)     the joint account holders, who had the legal right to withdraw the funds in the Account, are Malaysian citizens;

> (d)     the alleged withdrawal or retention by the defendant of funds belonging to the plaintiff took place in Malaysia and therefore the cause of action was likely to have accrued in Malaysia; and

> (e)     the testimony of Citibank Malaysia would be material as to the identity of the person(s) who collected the money at the bank during the Disputed Withdrawals on 28 and 30 May 2013.

21     I shall elaborate further on my fifth point above as the Parties differed on this greatly, both factually and legally.

#### Availability of non-party witnesses

22     The pleaded case of the Parties as well as the conflicting affidavit evidence filed in the application before me suggested one of only two possible versions that could have occurred during the Disputed Withdrawals: (a) either the defendant had directly collected the sum of money from the bank teller at Citibank Malaysia; or (b) Chai and Heng collected the sum of money from the bank teller and then passed the entirety of the same to the defendant. In my judgment, the causes of action, the potential plaintiffs and defendants materially differed depending on which was the true version of events that took place. For this reason, I found that the testimony of the bank teller(s) who handled the Disputed Withdrawals and/or the evidence of Citibank Malaysia generally as to the practice of its bank in processing withdrawal requests would be crucial in the trial of the dispute in the Suit.

23     Further, as Citibank Malaysia is not a party witness in the Suit, the witness compellability factor highlighted by the Court of Appeal in _JIO Minerals_ at \[71\] was germane in my assessment at Stage 1:

> In so far as the Witness Compellability Factor is concerned, a Singapore court cannot compel a foreign witness to testify in a Singapore court (see O 38 r 18(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)). Therefore, the fact that the Indonesian Witnesses cannot be compelled by a Singapore court to either testify in person in Singapore or to give evidence via video-link is a factor that points to Indonesia as being the natural forum. …

24     The plaintiff contended that no weight should be given to this factor because the relevant witnesses from Citibank Malaysia have not been identified by the defendant. With respect, I did not find this contention borne out by any of the authorities relied upon by the plaintiff. To the contrary, the Court of Appeal has stated as follows in _JIO Minerals_ (at \[67\]):

> … \[T\]he Appellants have endeavoured to explain the reasons why they require the testimony of the Indonesian Witnesses. It would not be appropriate to require the Appellants to demonstrate _exactly_ how they would use the testimony of the Indonesian Witnesses at this interlocutory stage. The Appellants have not yet prepared their Defence. We acknowledge, on the other hand, that a defendant applying for a stay should not be permitted to assert, without substantiation, that it requires foreign witnesses because that would make it easy for defendants to manufacture a connecting factor. Our view was that a defendant should at least show that evidence from foreign witnesses is at least arguably relevant to its defence. … \[emphasis in original\]

25     In my judgment, even though the defendant has filed his defence in the Suit, the Suit remains at the interlocutory stage such that the rationale stated by the Court of Appeal applied with equal force to the present case. For the reasons explained above at \[22\] as to the relevance of evidence from Citibank Malaysia and the pleaded defence by the defendant that the Disputed Withdrawals were made by Chai and Heng at Citibank Malaysia (see paragraph 6 of the Defence), I found that the defendant had clearly satisfied the above threshold.

#### Applicable choice of law to the Agreement

26     As the plaintiff’s cause of action in the Suit was premised on a breach of contract by the defendant in failing to honour the profit-sharing arrangement, it was necessary for me to determine the applicable law to the Agreement.

27     In this regard, it is accepted law that the court applies a three-stage approach to determine the governing law of a contract (see _Pacific Recreation Pte Ltd v S Y Technology Inc and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 491</span> (“_Pacific Recreation_”) at \[36\]). At the first stage, the court considers whether the parties had expressly chosen a governing law. If there is no express choice made by the parties, the court considers at the second stage whether the intention of the parties as to the governing law can be inferred from the circumstances. If the court is unable to infer the parties’ intentions, it proceeds to the third stage where the court assesses which system of law the contract has its most close and real connection.

28     Applying the three-stage approach, it was clear that there was no express law to the Agreement. It was not in dispute here that the Agreement was not in writing.

29     Moving on to the second stage, the Court of Appeal in _Pacific Recreation_ has identified several factors that are considered at this stage. The relevant factors to the present case are as follows (see _Pacific Recreation_ at \[37\] and \[43\]–\[44\]):

> (a)     the places of residences of the contracting parties;

> (b)     the currency of the contract or the currency for payment; and

> (c)     the place of contracting where it is the same as the place of performance.

30     The first factor above was neutral here because two of the contracting parties resided in Malaysia while the other two resided in Singapore.

31     As for the second factor, it was noteworthy that the dividends paid by VGC were all paid in RM.

32     The third factor was the most germane here. Here, the Parties had unambiguously structured their relationship in relation to the business venture of VGC to be based in Malaysia, even though they are Singaporeans. This was a deliberate choice they made. There was no evidence before me that the business of VGC extended to Singapore. The two other contracting parties to the Agreement, namely, Heng and Chai, were Malaysians. Notably, Heng and Chai were the contracting parties with the obligation to ensure that the dividends were returned equally to the Parties.

33     For these reasons, I found that it was reasonable to infer that the implied law governing the Agreement was likely to be Malaysian law.

34     Even if it could not be inferred that the Parties intended Malaysian law to be the governing law following the second stage of this analysis, I would have no difficulty arriving at the same conclusion law under the third stage as to which law bore the closest and most real connection to the Agreement (see _Pacific Recreation_ at \[47\] to \[49\]). For similar reasons as stated above, it was clear to me that Malaysian law bore the “most connection” with the Agreement and “the circumstances surrounding the inception of that contract” (_Pacific Recreation_ at \[48\]).

#### Relevant connections to Singapore

35     I turn now to the relevant connections to Singapore relied on by the defendant in resisting the stay.

36     First, the fact that the Parties to the action reside in Singapore was not, in my judgment, a _materially_ relevant connection to the dispute. On this point, I find the following passage in _Rappo, Tania_ at \[71\] to be instructive:

> … While \[the factors stated at \[16\] above\] provides a useful list of potentially relevant indicators for the court’s consideration, we think that a mechanistic application of this framework will be of little utility and may in fact be misleading in certain cases. For instance, in disputes involving well-heeled parties who have a high degree of mobility, such as the present dispute, the current domicile of the parties may be of little legal significance, depending on the circumstances of the case. The court should always be astute to determine those _incidences that are likely to be material to the fair determination of the dispute, and to ascribe greater weight to those incidences over others, as the case may require_. \[emphasis added\]

37     While the current domicile of the Parties was no doubt a relevant factor, to my mind, this was not a weighty consideration as compared to the other factors such as the likely applicable law to the dispute (see \[26\]–\[34\] above).

38     The plaintiff also relied on the following observation made in _CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 543</span> (“_CIMB Bank_”) to argue that the Parties’ pre-existing relationship of being married in Singapore meant that Singapore is the place with which the dispute has the closest connection (_CIMB Bank_ at \[59\]):

> Naturally, in view of the diverse situations in which a restitutionary claim may arise, the place of enrichment may not always be the place with which the claim has the closest connection. _Dicey, Morris and Collins_ at para 34-031 gives the example of a case where there is a _“pre-existing relationship between the parties which, though not contractual, may justify giving weight to the law which governed that relationship in the search for the law with which the obligation to make restitution has its closest connection”_. A case where such an exception was applied was _Hashim_ (\[39\] _supra_) which concerned the recovery of a bribe received by an employee in Switzerland. On appeal, the Court of Appeal, in _Arab Monetary Fund v Hashim_ \[1996\] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 589 at 597 (_per_ Saville LJ), held that the applicable law to govern the recovery of the bribe was that of Abu Dhabi, as it was in Abu Dhabi that the relationship of employer and employee was created, and it was also there that the building contract was awarded to the briber as a result of the dishonest abuse of the briber’s and the bribe recipient’s (_ie_, the employee’s) relationship with the third party concerned (_ie_, the employer). In the circumstances, the court did not regard as significant the fact that the bribe was paid in Switzerland. \[emphasis added\]

39     I make three observations on the plaintiff’s reliance on the preceding exception to the general rule identified in _CIMB Bank_. First, I considered the shape of the litigation (_ie_, the pleadings) (see \[16(e)\] above). Here, the plaintiff had only alleged a breach of the Agreement in the Statement of Claim – there was no suggestion in the Statement of Claim of any claim in restitution or unjust enrichment. Second, even if such a claim had been pleaded, it was not clear to me that the facts of the case could give rise to such a cause of action by the plaintiff against the defendant. Third and in any event, the “pre-existing relationship” here, as referred to in _CIMB Bank_ at \[59\], would be the Parties’ relationship as business partners in a Malaysian business; not their relationship as former spouses in Singapore. This is because the Disputed Withdrawals arose in the context of VGC; not in the course of their marriage. For completeness, I should add here that the plaintiff’s attempt to claim the same sum of money in the ancillary matrimonial proceedings was dismissed by the Family Justice Court on 23 October 2019.

40     Next, the plaintiff highlighted that the Handwriting Expert was based in Singapore. With respect, this contention ignored the fact that the Handwriting Expert was an _expert witness_ commissioned by the plaintiff. Further, there was no evidence before me that the Handwriting Expert would be unwilling or incapable of testifying in Malaysia. In this regard, I found the following observation made by the Court of Appeal in _JIO Minerals_ to be of assistance (at \[68\]):

> Since the Appellants require the testimony of the Indonesian Witnesses, it appears that this factor points to Indonesia as the natural forum. However, our analysis did not end there. It was necessary for us to consider whether (a) the possibility of obtaining evidence from the Indonesian Witnesses through video-link and (b) the fact that Indonesia is relatively close to Singapore suggest that this factor should not be given substantial weight. Our view was that both considerations were persuasive and hence operated against the Appellants on this particular sub-issue.

The above observation applied _a fortiori_ here given the closer proximity of Malaysia to Singapore (see also _Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 1192</span> held at \[35\]) and the fact that the Handwriting Expert was not a factual non-party witness but rather an expert specially commissioned by one of the Parties to the Suit.

41     Lastly, the plaintiff highlighted that the police reports for, among other things, forgery of the Voucher by the defendant had been lodged in Singapore. In my judgment, this was a neutral factor because police reports could also have been lodged in Malaysia. If this factor was to be regarded as material, it would be all too easy for a plaintiff to manufacture a more “appropriate” forum by simply filing a police report in that jurisdiction. That cannot be right.

### Stage 2

42     Having come to the determination that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum in this case for the trial of the substantive dispute between the Parties, the burden was then on the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of any special circumstances in the interests of justice to convince the court to exercise its _discretion_ to refuse the stay (see _BDA v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 1 SLR 607</span> at \[23\] and _JIO Minerals_ at \[40\]).

43     From the reply affidavit filed by the plaintiff in this summons, there was no averment of _any_ prejudice to the plaintiff if the action was to be heard in Malaysia. Even putting aside this procedural point and considering the issue of time bar afresh, there was no evidence before me of the limitation periods in Malaysia or the ease of availability of extending limitation periods in Malaysia.

44     Even if the claim was time barred in Malaysia, it appeared to me that the plaintiff was to be faulted for this. If the matter is time barred in Malaysia, even considering the plaintiff’s explanation that she tried to resolve the matter amicably first before taking legal action, the plaintiff only has herself to blame for dragging her feet for almost _five_ years before commencing the Suit.

45     I accordingly found that the plaintiff was unable to demonstrate the existence of any special circumstances to convince me to exercise my discretion in the present case.

## Conclusion

46     For the foregoing reasons, I granted the stay in favour of the defendant.

47     After hearing the Parties on costs, I also fixed the costs of the application in the sum of $3,000 (inclusive of reasonable disbursements) to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant.
