### Magistrate Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       This case concerned the outrage of modesty of a male private hire driver by two male passengers. At the material time, the victim, a 28-year-old married man (“the victim”), was employed as a full-time private hire driver for Grab Holdings Inc. (“Grab”).

2       In a joint trial, Mr Goh Suet Hong (“Goh”) and Mr Neo Wei Meng (“Neo”) (collectively, “the accused persons”) claimed trial to one charge each under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) for outraging the modesty of the victim (“the Charges”).

3       Following the conclusion of the joint trial, I found the accused persons to be guilty of their respective Charges. I sentenced Goh to a term of 12 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane, and Neo to a term of 14 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Both accused persons have since filed appeals against their conviction and sentence. I now set out my full reasons in the following grounds of decision.

## The Charges

4       The material particulars of the single charge faced by the accused persons respectively were as follows:

> (a)     Goh’s charge: on 12 November 2018, between 1.18am and 3.03am, in a vehicle which was proceeding towards Block 624C Punggol Central, Singapore, Goh did use criminal force on the victim by kissing the victim’s left cheek and left side of the lip, and using his hand to rub the victim’s penis over the pants, knowing it to be likely that Goh would thereby outrage his modesty; and

> (b)     Neo’s charge: on the same date, during the same period and in the same vehicle, Neo did use criminal force on the victim by touching the victim’s nipples under his shirt and using his hands to directly rub the victim’s penis, knowing it to be likely that Neo would thereby outrage his modesty.

## The undisputed facts

5       The agreed facts were helpfully recorded in the Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”), which was admitted by consent during the first day of trial. I reproduce the salient facts from the ASOF and other exhibits below.

### The accused persons

6       Goh is a Malaysian citizen and Singapore permanent resident. At the material time, Goh was employed as a hairdresser and resided at Block 624C, Punggol Central, Singapore 823624 (“Goh’s residence”).

7       Neo is a male Singaporean. He was employed as a freelance interior designer and resided at Block 159, Hougang Street 11, Singapore 530159 (“Neo’s residence”) at the material time.

### Background information on the events surrounding the Charges

8       On 11 November 2018, at around 10.00pm, the accused persons and another friend met for drinks at E Bar, a bar located along Neil Road, Singapore. After a night of drinking, the accused persons decided to head home together.

9       Neo made a booking on Grab with two drop-off locations. The first drop-off location was Neo’s residence and the second drop-off location was Goh’s residence. The mode of payment was cash. This booking was assigned to the victim by Grab’s computer system at 1.18am on 12 November 2018.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

10     Sometime later, the victim picked the accused persons up along Neil Road. At that point in time, the accused persons sat in the rear passenger seats of the victim’s vehicle. The victim then drove towards the first drop-off location. During the journey to the first drop-off location (“the first leg”), the victim drove along the Central Expressway (“CTE”). Upon reaching the first drop-off location, both accused persons alighted from the vehicle. After Neo left, Goh sat in the front passenger seat (_ie_, next to the victim). The victim then drove towards the second drop-off location (“the second leg”). Upon reaching the second drop-off location, Goh instructed the victim to enter a multi-storey car park (“the MSCP”). After the victim drove into the MSCP, Goh alighted from the vehicle and told the victim to wait for him while Goh relieved himself. The victim instead drove the vehicle away.

### First information report

11     On 12 November 2018, at around 3.03am, the victim lodged a police report at Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre (“NPC”), stating that he had been “molested by two unknown male passengers”.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) Goh’s Versace handbag, which also contained his mobile phone and other personal belongings, was left in the victim’s vehicle, and was handed over by the victim to the police when he made the police report.

12     Following the victim’s report, the accused persons were arrested by the police on 14 November 2018.

### Other salient undisputed facts

13     In addition to the ASOF, several other undisputed facts that emerged at trial are worth highlighting at this juncture:

> (a)     Both accused persons admitted that they are homosexuals.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

> (b)     The accused persons have known each for about 15 years and they frequently met and shared private hire trips together.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (c)     The first time the accused persons met the victim was on the same day as the alleged incident, _ie_, on 12 November 2018.

> (d)     During the second leg of the journey (_ie_, from Hougang to Punggol), Goh admitted to kissing the victim on his left cheek and left side of the lip and using his hands to rub the victim’s penis over his pants, albeit allegedly under his purported belief that the victim consented to these actions.

> (e)     All of Goh’s personal belongings were handed over by the victim to the police at the Punggol NPC. In other words, Goh confirmed that none of his items were missing.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

## The Prosecution’s case

14     The Prosecution formulated Neo’s charge based on his conduct during the _first_ leg of the journey, whilst Goh’s charge was solely based on his conduct during the _second_ leg. With this understanding, the Prosecution outlined its case as follows.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

15     When the accused persons boarded the victim’s vehicle, Goh sat directly behind the victim in the rear passenger seat, while Neo sat in the middle of the rear passenger seat. Shortly after boarding the victim’s car, the accused persons began molesting the victim while he was driving them home. At this point, the accused persons were both drunk.

16     During the first leg, Goh started by playing with the victim’s nipple over his shirt and thereafter went under his shirt to directly touch the victim’s nipples. The victim told Goh to stop. At the same time, Neo began rubbing the victim’s penis over the victim’s trousers. Soon after, Neo unbuckled the victim’s belt, unzipped the victim’s trousers, and began directly rubbing the victim’s bare penis. The victim told Neo to stop. Instead, Neo licked the victim’s left ear and cheek.

17     Subsequently, the accused persons conversed in Mandarin. Following this conversation, they switched their actions whereupon Neo played with the victim’s nipples under his shirt while Goh began stroking the victim’s bare penis. The victim did not consent to any of this contact. In fact, he told them to stop on multiple occasions but they ignored him.

18     After reaching the first drop-off location at Hougang, Neo left the victim’s vehicle and returned home. Goh then moved from the rear passenger seat to the front passenger seat. Soon after the victim started driving towards Punggol, Goh kissed the victim on his left cheek and on his lips. Goh also rubbed the victim’s penis over the victim’s trousers. The victim did not consent to any of this contact.

## The Defence’s case

### Goh’s defence

19     Goh’s charge only concerned the second leg of the journey for which he admitted to the _actus reus_ at trial. Goh however argued that the victim had consented to his actions.

20     I observe at the outset that it was not at all clear what _type_ of consent was being relied upon by the Defence. From the questions put to the victim, the only live issue appeared to be that of _express_ consent. However, during submissions, the defence appeared to have evolved to that of “implied consent” and/or “mistaken consent”. However, these other suggestions were never put to the victim. Nevertheless, for completeness, I considered all three types of consent in relation to Goh’s offence in the analysis below.

### Neo’s defence

21     Unlike Goh, Neo’s defence was simply one of bare denial. He claimed that he was asleep for virtually the entire Grab journey during the first leg.

22     While it was initially suggested by the Defence during trial that it was physically impossible for Neo to molest the victim in the manner alleged from his seat in the victim’s car, this argument was no longer pursued by the Defence in the closing submissions.

## The issues

23     In relation to Goh’s defence of consent, the issues to be determined were as follows:

> (a)     whether the victim had expressly or impliedly consented to Goh’s actions;

> (b)     whether Goh could rely on the defence of “mistaken consent”; and

> (c)     intimately linked to the first two issues, the consideration of whether the victim’s evidence was “unusually convincing”.

24     For Neo’s charge, given the defence of bare denial, the sole issue here was whether the victim’s testimony was “unusually convincing”.

25     Before I deal with the case in respect of each accused person separately, given the overlapping issue in their Charges in relation to the victim’s evidence, I first address the general observations that applied equally to both accused persons.

## Assessing the victim’s evidence

26     It is well-established that where a complainant’s evidence is _uncorroborated_, the complainant’s testimony has to be “unusually convincing” in order to find the accused person to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (see, _eg_, the decisions in _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”) at \[87\]; and _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Liton_”) at \[37\]).

### Whether the victim was “unusually convincing”

27     In _GCK_ (at \[88\]), the Court of Appeal helpfully observed, quoting from _Liton_ at \[39\], that a complainant’s testimony would be “unusually convincing” if the testimony:

> ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’.

> The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’ demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence.

28     On a granular assessment of all the evidence given by the witnesses as well as the documentary evidence tendered, I found the following aspects of the victim’s evidence in relation to the details of his sexual assault to be “unusually convincing”:[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

> (a)     After the victim picked up the accused persons, they uttered the following words to the victim:[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

>> (i)       He “look\[ed\] very cute”.

>> (ii)       “Do you know God have \[_sic_\] sent us to pleasure you”.

>> (iii)       “\[W\]e are a woman \[_sic_\] disguised as a man”.

> (b)     During the first leg of the journey, specifically along the CTE, Goh used his right hand to press the victim against his seat and started to play with the victim’s nipple over the victim’s shirt, before going under his shirt to directly play with the victim’s nipples.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) At this point, the victim verbally informed Goh to stop.[^10]

> (c)     At around the same time, Neo unbuckled the victim’s seat belt and started to rub the victim’s penis over his trousers.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) Neo then unbuckled the victim’s belt, unzipped the victim’s trousers, and rubbed the victim’s exposed penis, making direct skin-to-skin contact. The victim verbally told Neo to stop. However, Neo persisted and then started to lick the victim’s left cheek and ear.[^12]

> (d)     After some time, the accused persons switched their actions. Neo played with the victim’s nipples under his shirt, whilst Goh began directly stroking the victim’s exposed penis.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) The victim’s repeated pleas for the accused persons to stop were ignored.[^14] Their actions only stopped after the accused persons had spotted a police car when the victim exited the Pan Island Expressway (“PIE”) at the Paya Lebar Road exit.[^15]

> (e)     After the victim’s vehicle had reached the car park at Hougang, the accused persons alighted from the vehicle. Neo headed home while Goh moved to the front passenger seat of the victim’s car.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (f)     Soon after the victim started to drive off from the car park, Goh started to kiss the victim on his lips and left cheeks and rubbed his hand over the victim’s penis (over the pants). The victim’s cries for Goh to stop were ignored.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> (g)     After the victim had exited the gantry of the car park, Goh asked the victim to stop the car immediately. The victim complied as he was fearful that if he did not comply, Goh might hurt him. Once the car was stationary, Goh started to kiss the victim and rub the victim’s penis again over his pants. Further, Goh inserted his tongue into the victim’s mouth. The victim again resisted but to no avail. Goh’s actions of kissing the victim on his lips during this time lasted for about three minutes in total. Goh only stopped his actions when he saw a couple crossing the road in front of the victim’s vehicle whereupon Goh directed the victim to move off.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

> (h)     Goh then asked the victim to spend time with him in the car for some time after reaching the final drop-off at Punggol, but this overture was declined by the victim. During this part of the journey, Goh asked the victim to drive slowly and repeatedly rubbed the victim’s penis over his pants. The victim again asked Goh to stop but was likewise ignored.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

> (i)     Upon reaching the drop-off at Punggol, Goh asked the victim to proceed to the MSCP and park the car there for him to go behind a pillar to urinate. The victim complied but as soon as Goh alighted the car and started to urinate, the victim drove off from the MSCP.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

29     The victim was very consistent with his evidence throughout the trial and did not waver in his testimony despite rigorous cross-examination. Indeed, the Defence did not pursue any arguments regarding the victim’s demeanour or highlight any external inconsistencies in his evidence even though these were the relevant considerations in assessing the victim’s evidence (see \[27\] above).

30     Instead, all that the Defence advanced to suggest that the victim was not an “unusually convincing” witness was to highlight two points. First, it was argued that the victim was unclear and unsure of the respective seating positions of the accused persons.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) This was a gross misrepresentation of the victim’s evidence. Both during examination-in-chief and cross-examination, the victim was very clear that during the first leg of the journey, it was Goh who had sat directly behind him, and that Neo was seated in the middle of the back seat.[^22] The victim did not at any point retract from this testimony or qualify his testimony.

31     Second, the Defence argued that the victim failed to seek assistance during both the first and second legs of the journey, despite having “ample opportunity” to do so.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) Here, I understood the Defence to be referring to the victim failing to stop the vehicle on the shoulder of either the CTE or PIE, dashing out of the car when he saw the police car after exiting the PIE, and seeking the assistance of the couple who had crossed the road during the second leg of the journey.

32     These arguments appear to have been made in oversight and without reference to recent observations made by the High Court. For instance, in _GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”), See Kee Oon J observed as follows at \[20\] (see also _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span> at \[30\]):

> 20    I should add that I saw absolutely no merit in the appellant’s insinuation that the victim must have been making false allegations against him because her behaviour at and around the time of the alleged offence was **_atypical_** of a victim of a sexual crime. I shared the district judge’s view (at \[68\] of the GD …) that _victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner_. … \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

33     In other words, there is no such thing as an expected or typical response to be expected from a victim of a sexual offence. What is more germane is an assessment on the facts of each case as to whether the victim’s behaviour was “well within the realm of possibilities” (_GBR_ at \[20\]). In the present case, I found the victim’s failure to do any of the actions suggested by the Defence to be clearly “within the realm of possibilities”. The victim explained that he continued to drive despite being molested because he was terrified of the accused persons. He was also worried that if had terminated the trip early, his Grab account would be suspended.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

34     The victim’s behaviour must be understood in the unique circumstances of this case. At the material time, he had only been a Grab driver for about a year and that was also his only source of income.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) In the confines of an enclosed space, while he was in control of the vehicle, he was molested by two male passengers. It was completely understandable for the victim to have been put in fear in such a situation. At different junctures of both the first and second legs, the victim had expressed his fear as follows:

> Q:[^26]\[Referring to events at \[28(b)\]–\[28(c)\] above\] And why didn’t you stop the car when these acts which you just described were taking place?

> A:    Because I am **_too scared_**.

> Q:    What were you scared of?

> A:    I’m scared of if I will stop the car and I run off, they might be able to catch me \[_sic_\].

> …

> Q:[^27]\[Referring to events at \[28(d)\] above\] So, can you explain to us why you did not put the car on parking mode rather than drive mode and alert the police?

> A:    Because I \[was\] **_too scared_** to do that if they see or if they know my intention was to stop the car immediately and run over to the police. I am just afraid \[_sic_\].

> …

> Q:[^28]And can you explain to us what you were afraid of?

> A:    You know, **_I’m afraid \[that\] they might_** … **_catch me and beat me up_** while I was running over to the police car behind me.

> \---

> Q:[^29]And why did you stop the car \[referring to the events described at \[28(g)\] above\]?

> A:    Because **_I’m too scared if I didn’t listen to what he say_**\[s\]**_, he might injure me or he might hurt me_**.

> \[emphasis added\]

35     The victim also explained that if his Grab account were suspended, he would no longer be able to receive any new trips until investigations were completed.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) He went on to explain the consequent financial ramifications as follows:[^31]

> I am not able to pay my daily rental, I am not able to drive until my account has been reactivated back by Grab. So there is no other … jobs \[_sic_\] that I can do in order for me to pay my daily rental and to get my income for the day.

36     Given these consequences, it was understandable that the victim was conscious of completing the multi-destination booking before reporting the offences – he simply did not want to risk his rice bowl. Indeed, this was exactly what the victim did. Once he had reached the designated final drop-off point at Punggol and alighted Goh at the Punggol MSCP, the victim drove off from the MSCP whilst Goh was still urinating. This was despite Goh’s request for the victim to wait for him to relieve himself and the undisputed fact that the victim had not collected the fare for the trip[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) (as stated above at \[9\], this was a cash trip). Here, the victim credibly explained his thought process as follows:[^33]

> Q:    And why did you decide to drive off at that point in time?

> A:    … I am fully aware that these 2 subject is \[_sic_\] no longer inside my car.

> Q:    Could you elaborate on that?

> A:    …\[Now,\] I am alone in my car. Hence, it gives me … the confidence to … run away from them \[_sic_\].

> Q:    And why did you have the confidence to run away from them when \[Goh\] alighted from your car?

> A:    … I \[was\] very certain that \[Goh\] will not be able to catch me.

> …

> Q:    Why did you decide to drive away at this second location and not the first \[drop-off\]?

> …

> A:    The first drop off location because I can still see them… visually. And at the second drop off point, I decided to dash off … because … both of them \[were\] no longer … in my view. And also, for what I know, I have completed the trip \[_sic_\].

37     At this point, it is also pertinent to highlight two important pieces of evidence. First, it was not disputed that Goh’s belongings were still in the car when the victim had driven off. The victim then called the Grab hotline to inform them that: (a) he was molested; (b) he did not collect the fare for the trip; and (c) Goh’s personal belongings were still in his car.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34)

38     Second, both Goh[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) and the victim[^36] were consistent in their evidence that the front passenger door through which Goh had alighted at the MSCP was not completely shut at the point when the victim decided to make a dash for safety. In my judgment, this undisputed detail evidenced the post sexual-assault desperation of the victim in escaping from his assailant.

39     Finally, I had no reason to doubt that the victim was speaking the truth in this case. The accused persons were complete strangers to the victim prior to the incident. Based on the evidence before me, the victim simply had nothing to gain from fabricating these allegations against them.

40     For the aforementioned reasons, I found the victim’s evidence to be “unusually convincing” such that his testimony alone was sufficiently strong to prove the Charges against the accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Corroborative weight in victim’s police report

41     In addition, I found that there was some material corroborating weight to be attached to the victim’s timely report to the police at the Punggol NPC.

42     In _Liton_, the Court of Appeal confirmed that a more liberal approach to corroboration (as opposed to the stricter standard which requires _independent_ evidence) is adopted in Singapore. In the words of the Court of Appeal, “\[w\]hat is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate” (see _Liton_ at \[42\]–\[43\]). What this means is that the court can in an appropriate case consider a complainant’s statement or account of events to another as corroborative of the complainant’s evidence in court: see, _eg_, _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> at \[173\] citing _Public Prosecutor v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span> at 33.

43     Indeed, this principle is enshrined in s 159 of the Evidence Act 1893 (“Evidence Act”), which reads as follows:

> **Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact**

> 159.  In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact _at or about the time when the fact took place_, or _before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact_, may be proved. \[emphasis added\]

44     Applying these principles, I found the police report lodged by the victim almost immediately after dropping Goh off at Punggol to be corroborative of the victim’s testimony that he had been molested by both accused persons.

45     While I was hampered by the lack of clear evidence as to the exact time at which Goh was dropped off and the time at which the victim reached the Punggol NPC, a reasonable inference could be made from the available facts. First, the victim testified that he had picked up the accused persons at 1.35am.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) His testimony was, in my assessment, likely to be accurate, extrapolating from the fact that the booking request was made at 1.18am, factoring in time for the accused to travel to the pick-up location (driving 1.35km).[^38] After 1.35am, the victim had to first drive from Neil Road to Hougang (_ie_, the first leg) and thereafter to Punggol (_ie_, the second leg). This would likely have taken about 30 minutes. Thereafter, the victim explained that he called the Grab hotline to inform them that he had been molested, whereupon he was advised to head to the nearest police station. At the Punggol NPC, the victim handed over Goh’s belongings and was then asked to wait for the senior investigation officer (“SIO”) to interview him.[^39] The police report was lodged by the victim on 12 November 2018 at 3.03am, where it was recorded as follows:[^40]

> On 12.11.2018 at about 0135hrs, I was molested by two unknown male passengers.

46     From the above, a reasonable inference could be drawn that the account given by the victim in his first information report was made _very soon_ after dropping off Goh at the Punggol MSCP, clearly satisfying the requirements of s 159 of the Evidence Act (see \[43\] above). The weight to be given to this corroborating statement was also high, given how soon it was recorded after the incident. The victim’s testimony that he was molested by the accused persons was therefore corroborated by his timely police report.

47     I turn now to deal with my findings that are specific to each accused person, beginning with Goh.

## Goh’s charge

### Goh’s long statement

48     Before dealing with Goh’s defence of consent, I first consider the investigative statement recorded by the police from Goh (“long statement”) under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). Goh’s long statement was recorded by SIO Muhammad Rafi bin Ishak (“PW1”), which was then interpreted to Goh in Mandarin by Station Inspector Kenneth Koh (“PW2”). In the long statement, Goh had admitted to kissing the victim on his left cheek, kissing the victim on his lips, and using his hand to rub the victim’s penis over the pants.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) In particular, Goh had expressed “regret” for his actions as follows:[^42]

> … I regret doing such acts on him and I was drunk during that time. I thought he \[_sic_\] fine with what I did.

49     Goh did not dispute the voluntariness of this long statement but testified that he did not express any “regret” for his actions to PW1.[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43) The Defence then alleged that there were some inaccuracies in the long statement because PW2 was not present in the interview room until _after_ PW1 had completed the recording of the statement.

50     I rejected this factual suggestion. First, both PW1 and PW2 were consistent in their testimony that PW2 had joined the interview whilst the long statement was _still_ being recorded and not _after_ it had been completed.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) In terms of the exact sequence of events, PW1 explained that he initially conducted the interview with Goh in a mixture of English and Malay, given that Goh was a Malaysian and Goh appeared to comprehend PW1’s questions.[^45] Subsequently, when PW1 learned that Goh was more comfortable in Mandarin, he requested for a Mandarin interpreter to avoid any miscommunication.[^46] After PW2 arrived, PW1 continued to question Goh in English which PW2 translated into Mandarin for Goh.[^47] After the recording of the statement was completed, PW2 confirmed that he read back the long statement to Goh line-by-line in Mandarin and that Goh acknowledged that he understood what was being read back to him.[^48] The Defence failed to proffer any reason why both PW1 and PW2 would have lied about this sequence of events.

51     Second, there were some material aspects of the long statement that were indeed consistent with Goh’s testimony at trial such as his position that he was asleep during the first leg of the journey[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) as well as the allusion to “mistaken consent” assumed by Goh when he stated, “I thought he \[was\] fine with what I did”.[^50] These material similarities militated against a finding that there were inaccuracies in Goh’s long statement.

52     In any event, as a matter of law, what is required of a long statement under s 22 of the CPC is only as follows:

> (4)    Where a statement made by a person examined under this section is recorded in writing, the statement must —

>> (_a_)    be read over to the person;

>> (_b_)     _if the person does not understand English, be interpreted for the person in a language that the person understands_; and

>> (_c_)    be signed by the person.

> \[emphasis added\]

53     There is therefore no express requirement for the interpreter to be present throughout the statement recording process. What is required instead is only that the recorded statement be interpreted to the accused if he does not understand English. Pertinently, here, Goh confirmed that the statement was read back by PW2 to Goh in Mandarin (a language he was proficient in), and he would therefore have been fully aware of the contents of the statement prior to signing it.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51) Goh was also offered the opportunity to make amendments but he declined to do so.[^52]

54     Further and in any event, even if there was any procedural irregularity in the recording of the long statement, this would not, by itself, affect the admissibility of the statement (see Explanation 2(_e_) to s 258(3) of the CPC; see also _Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 1205</span> at \[44\]–\[45\]). The issue of whether any alleged procedural irregularity ought to affect the weight accorded to the long statement is a separate matter that I discuss at \[63\] below.

### Express consent

55     The case put to the victim during the trial was premised on express consent (see \[20\] above). In response to that, the victim was very consistent that he had at no point agreed to Goh’s actions. He also stated that he pleaded for Goh to stop his actions multiple times.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53) I found the victim’s evidence on this point to be “unusually convincing” and preferred his evidence to that of Goh’s testimony.

56     In particular, the victim’s undisputed actions after reaching the Punggol MSCP were consistent with his testimony that he did not consent to Goh’s actions. In short, if the victim had truly consented and had liked Goh the same way Goh did (as claimed by Goh[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)), there was no conceivable reason for the victim to suddenly dash away at the earliest opportunity even though Goh had told the victim to wait for him to relieve himself.

57     Insofar as it was suggested by Goh during the trial that the victim dashed away in order to steal Goh’s belongings, I found this suggestion to be extremely unlikely given that the victim had handed all of Goh’s belongings to the police station soon after he had dropped off Goh (see \[13(e)\] above). Goh also confirmed during trial that _all_ his belongings had been returned by the victim to the Punggol NPC.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

58     Goh further suggested that the victim decided to handover the items to the police after realising that there was no cash in Goh’s handbag.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) However, this suggestion was never put to the victim. I highlight here that the burden was on the Defence to specifically prove motive for a false allegation by a witness (see _GCK_ at \[102\]). Further and in any event, several of the other belongings that the victim had handed over such as the Versace handbag and Apple iPhone 7 were items of value.[^57] It was also highly unlikely that the victim would have been so brazen to steal his passengers’ belongings given that his identity could have been easily tracked down by the police through Grab’s assistance. In short, I found that the victim simply had no reason to fabricate these allegations against Goh.

59     In contrast, Goh’s evidence was markedly less believable. Goh testified that he was asleep for most parts of the first leg of the journey.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58) Nevertheless, he maintained that after Neo had gotten off at Hougang, he decided to move to the front seat whereupon he kissed the victim on his lips and cheeks as well as rubbed his penis. I found this sequence of events narrated by Goh to be extremely incredible. If it were indeed true that Goh was asleep during the first leg, it defied logic for Goh to abruptly decide to move to the front passenger seat and go from being sleepy to becoming sexually excited all of a sudden. Related to this point, Neo also testified that in all previous instances when the accused persons shared a ride back home together, only Neo would exit the car after reaching his place.[^59] If that were the usual practice, Goh’s decision to exit the car after reaching Neo’s residence and move to the front seat during this trip was significant. Further, it was especially hard to believe that Goh, who had been allegedly asleep during the first leg, instead of continuing to sleep after Neo alighted at Hougang, woke up from his sleep and decided to move to the front to engage in sexual contact with the victim not only spontaneously but also consensually. Goh also did not explain why he decided to move to the front seat only after Neo had alighted.

60     It also bears mention that Goh did not state this defence of express consent in his long statement. To the contrary, the references in the long statement to “I _thought_ he \[was\] fine with what I did” \[emphasis added\] and “\[f\]rom my observation, he seems like he enjoy \[_sic_\] the act I did on him” clearly negated the suggestion of express consent. Goh did not suggest that these references in his long statement were inaccurate.

61     It therefore did not come as any surprise that Goh admitted during cross-examination that the victim did not expressly consent to him doing any of the acts specified in Goh’s charge.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) Thereafter, Goh changed tack to suggest that the victim _must have_ consented (_ie_, no express consent) to his actions.[^61]

### Implied consent/mistaken consent

62     This now brings me to the Defence’s suggestion of “implied” consent given by the victim and/or “mistaken consent” assumed by Goh. The basis of both defences was identified to be the victim’s alleged “smile” when Goh kissed him on his cheek (“the post-kiss smile”).[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) The most fatal aspect of these alternative defences was that it was never put to the victim that he had smiled after being kissed by Goh.

63     In addition, this seemingly exculpatory fact of the post-kiss smile was conspicuously absent in Goh’s long statement. If it were indeed true that the victim had smiled after being kissed, it would clearly be in Goh’s interests to include this in his statement. Even considering the procedural irregularity alleged by Goh (_ie_, that the interpreter (PW2) was not present throughout the interview), I did not think that my power to draw adverse inferences should be adversely affected. Here, we are concerned with an _omission_ of a material fact (_ie_, the post-kiss smile) to Goh’s defence in his statement rather than any _express_ inaccurate references. In such a case, when the statement was read back to Goh in Mandarin, which Goh did not deny was done (see \[53\] above), Goh could easily have asked for this post-kiss smile to be recorded in this statement. Goh’s failure to include a fact so material to his defence at trial in his police statement recorded just two days after the incident led me to conclude that his allegation of the post-kiss smile was merely an afterthought.

64     For the issue of mistaken consent, this comes under the definition of s 79 of the Penal Code. The Court of Appeal in _Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> held that for an accused to avail himself of this defence, the accused must establish on a balance of probabilities that “having exercised due care and attention, he believed that \[the victim\] consented to the sexual acts forming the basis of the offences” (at \[111\]). This standard was clearly not met by Goh. In addition to the Defence’s failure to put the “post-kiss smile” to the victim, Goh did not give evidence at trial as to how he had exercised any semblance of due care and attention, let alone prove this defence on a balance of probabilities.

65     Overall, the merits of Goh’s defence were well-summarised by him when asked by his defence counsel whether he had any final things to say about his charge during re-examination:[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

> … _I know my chances are very low_, but if I do not fight the case, then there is no way for the truth or the facts to be known to everyone. \[emphasis added\]

## Neo’s charge

66     Turning next to Neo’s charge, the defence was one of bare denial. Neo’s evidence was simply that he fell asleep after boarding the vehicle and barely spoke to the victim. Based on a holistic assessment of the evidence before me, I rejected Neo’s defence.

67     First, Neo confirmed during cross-examination that he barely spoke to the victim throughout the first leg of the journey,[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) and never at any point told the victim that he was a homosexual.[^65] If it were indeed true that Neo had been asleep throughout the first leg and did not make any untoward sexual contact with the victim, the latter would have little to no reason to know that Neo had homosexual inclinations.[^66] In fact, if it turned out that Neo was not a homosexual, this could have compromised the victim’s claims that he had been molested by Neo.

68     Neo suggested at trial without any explanation that the victim could have “assumed”[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) that Neo was homosexual but there was simply no basis proffered by Neo as to how could the victim have so accurately assumed this fact to the point of being confident enough to make a police report within an hour after completing the trip.[^68]

69     Second, in relation to motive, Neo suggested that the victim made the false police report because he wanted to steal Goh’s belongings but subsequently had a change of heart.[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) Again, this begged the question of why the victim had to additionally implicate Neo by making a false allegation against him if according to Neo, he was simply an innocent sleeping bystander in the victim’s vehicle. This was a particularly material consideration in this case because Neo confirmed that his interactions with the victim were nothing but pleasant throughout the first leg of the journey.[^70]

70     Third, Neo’s evidence that he was asleep throughout the first leg was externally inconsistent, not only with the evidence of the victim, but also Goh’s conduct. It was not disputed that Goh had moved to the front passenger seat after the first leg of the journey (see \[10\] above). Neo’s evidence was that nothing happened during the first leg that would have prompted Goh to move to the front seat for the second leg.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71) Neo was also unable to answer when asked whether it was “odd that within … a minute of \[waking\] up … from sleep, \[Goh\] gets into the front seat”.[^72] In my judgment, it was unfathomable why Goh would suddenly decide (considering also Neo’s evidence at \[59\] above that only Neo would exit the car upon reaching his house based on past trips) to exit the car to move to the front seat if both accused persons had not been awake during the first leg. Put simply, there was no explicable reason (and certainly none proffered by Neo) for this atypical and abrupt decision by Goh to move to the front seat.

71     Further, Goh’s long statement did not mention that Neo was also sleeping during the first leg of the journey. To the contrary, the following extract in the long statement suggested that Neo was awake and had engaged in some form of conversation with the victim during the first leg:[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73)

> While in the car, I could not recall what questions that \[Neo\] asked the driver as I was feeling tipsy. …

72     Fourth, in weighing the evidence of Neo (which was substantially weakened by the three points above that underscored the implausibility of his testimony) and the victim, I preferred the victim’s evidence for reasons discussed above at \[29\]–\[39\]. Further, in contrast to the victim’s evidence on the _actus reus_ of the offence involving Goh, which was substantially corroborated by Goh’s admission, Neo’s claim that he was asleep throughout the first leg remained uncorroborated.

## Conclusion on conviction

73     All in all, I had no doubt in my mind that the victim was telling the truth in this case. His evidence, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available evidence, contained that “ring of truth” (see \[27\] above, citing _GCK_ at \[88\]) and I therefore found him to be an “unusually convincing” witness.

74     I also found that the arguments raised by the Defence fell short of raising any reasonable doubt in the Charges and thus found the accused persons to be guilty of their respective Charges, and convicted them accordingly.

## Sentence

75     What started out as a night like any other soon turned into a harrowing ordeal for the victim. He was repeatedly molested by the accused persons throughout the course of the journey. This incident left an indelible mark on the victim – he expressed that he remained “traumatised” and was unable to face “strangers anymore”.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74)

76     The maximum prescribed punishment for an offence under s 354(1) of the Penal Code 1871 is now three years’ imprisonment. However, at the time the offences took place, the maximum prescribed punishment was two years’ imprisonment. Since the sentencing benchmarks established by the High Court in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“_Kunasekaran_”) were enunciated in the erstwhile statutory landscape, this framework (“the _Kunasekaran_ framework”) was directly applicable to the case.

### Antecedents

77     Both accused persons were first-time offenders.

### Parties’ submissions

78     Based on an application of the _Kunasekaran_ framework, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 12 to 13 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane for Goh, and a sentence of 14 to 15 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for Neo. In arriving at this submission, the Prosecution submitted that both offences by the accused persons fell within Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework.

79     The Defence agreed with the Prosecution that both offences fell under Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework and submitted for a lenient sentence on the lowest end of the sentencing ranges submitted by the Prosecution. No submissions on the quantum of caning were made. The Defence also acknowledged that the offence-specific aggravating factors cited by the Prosecution were applicable, save that the Defence contended that intoxication should not be considered as an aggravating factor in this case.

80     I turn now to address the respective sentences for the accused persons, starting first with Goh.

### Goh’s sentence

81     I agreed with parties that Goh’s offence fell within Band 2 of the _Kunasekaran_ framework.

82     Chan Seng Onn J in _Kunasekaran_ held that the following three offence-specific factors laid down by See J in _GBR_ (in the context of an offence under s 354(2) of the Penal Code) equally apply to an offence under s 354(1) of the Penal Code in ascertaining which band the offence falls under (at \[48\]):

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation: this includes considerations of the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty;

> (b)     the circumstances of the offence: these include considerations of: (i) the presence of premeditation; (ii) the use of force or violence; (iii) the abuse of a position of trust; (iv) the use of deception; (v) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (vi) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim; and

> (c)     the harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological.

83     Before I deal with the offence-specific factors in this case, I first address the Defence’s argument on the relevance of voluntary intoxication in this case. It was contended that since the accused persons did not consume alcohol with the intention of committing the offence, their intoxicated state at the time of the offence should be disregarded. No case proposition was cited for this submission.

84     I disagreed with this contention as it contradicted the principle enunciated in the High Court decision of _Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> (“_Wong Hoi Len_”) that “a sentencing judge should _ordinarily_ take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration” (at \[44\]) \[emphasis in original\]. Indeed, in _Wong Hoi Len_, V K Rajah JA held that the “incontrovertible evidence of the appellant’s intoxication \[was\] already in itself an aggravating consideration” (at \[49\]).

85     For Goh’s offence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the following offence-specific aggravating factors featured in the present case:

> (a)     The degree of sexual exploitation was moderately high. Even though the offending conduct by Goh did not include skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts, Goh nevertheless made prolonged contact with the victim’s penis over his pants as well as kissed the victim on his lips for about _three minutes_. There were therefore multiple acts of molest (including contact with private parts) over a protracted duration in this case.

> (b)     In considering the circumstances of the offence, I took into account the following:

>> (i)       the offence was committed against a public transport service worker (see _Public Prosecutor v Jan Ber Mangilin Terrones_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 76</span> at \[22\]; see also _Balbir Singh s/o Amar Singh v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 784</span> at \[1\]);

>> (ii)       parts of the offence took place while the victim was driving, posing a safety hazard to the victim as well as other road users;

>> (iii)       Goh was voluntarily intoxicated at that point (see \[84\] above; see also _Public Prosecutor v Lim Choon Beng_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 169</span> at \[42\]);

>> (iv)       the immediate background to the offence in which Goh had participated in a group sexual assault; and

>> (v)       the uncharged acts of Goh in making skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s penis and nipples as well as inserting his tongue into the victim’s mouth.

> (c)     For the harm caused by the offence, the victim stated that he remained “traumatised” by the incident and was unable to face “strangers anymore”.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) The unchallenged evidence of the victim at trial was that after the incident, it took him “about a month” before he started driving Grab again but even then, his driving behaviour had changed – he only drove during the day and for short hours at that.[^76]

86     In relation to \[85(b)(iv) and (v)\] above, I should pause to clarify that I was empowered to sentence Goh based only on the particulars in his charge during the second leg of the journey. This much was clear from the following observations by Sundaresh Menon CJ in _GDC v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 5 SLR 1130</span> (“_GDC_”) at \[32\]:

> 32    The charge is the central feature of criminal proceedings and it must contain all the essential ingredients of the alleged offence so as to give the accused person notice of the case he must meet and ensure that he has the opportunity properly to defend himself (see _Li Weiming v Public Prosecutor and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 1227</span> at \[32\]). … While aggravating factors do not have to be included in the charge, where the Prosecution omits an important fact but then seeks to rely on that very fact as an aggravating factor, it risks infringing the rule that an offender cannot be punished for offences for which no charges have been brought (see _Chua Siew Peng v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1247</span> (“_Chua Siew Peng_”) at \[74\]–\[78\] and _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> at \[62\]). A sentencing court can and should consider all relevant and proved facts if they bear a sufficient nexus to the offence, such as those that form part of the immediate circumstances of the offence or those relevant to the offender’s culpability (_Chua Siew Peng_ at \[84\] and _Public Prosecutor v Bong Sim Swan Suzanna_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 1001</span> (“_Suzanna Bong_”) at \[65\]–\[66\]), but the weight to be accorded to such facts will vary when compared to a situation where those facts are part of the charge. An illustration will elucidate the point: an outrage of modesty offence that is constituted by skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s breast is a more serious violation than one that is constituted by a touch of the victim’s thigh over her clothes. Suppose that both violations have taken place in a given case. In such a setting, the Prosecution might choose to bring two separate charges. However, if the Prosecution chose for some reason to bring a single charge for the less serious violation, in my judgment, the sentencing analysis would be quite different than would have been the case had the charge been for the more serious violation. The fact that there was another violation that also occurred in the same incident and that involved a more serious intrusion would very likely feature as an aggravating factor that would result in a more onerous sentence than would have been the case had the sole intrusion been the touching of the victim’s thigh over her clothes. But even accounting for this aggravating factor, the analysis would not generally result in the sort of sentence that would have been warranted if the primary charge had been for skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s breast. To put it another way, _an aggravating factor will make the original offence more serious but it should not, as a matter of principle, result in the court sentencing the offender for what in essence is a different offence_. Where the Prosecution wishes to rely on such facts, rather than raising these as aggravating factors in relation to a less serious offence, the fair thing to do would be to frame an additional charge so as to ensure that the accused person has adequate notice of the conduct he is on trial for (_Suzanna Bong_ at \[64\]). \[emphasis added\]

Applying this caution in the present case, I was not allowed to sentence Goh as if he had also been charged with the other actions I have found he did based on the victim’s testimony, which included, among other things, skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s penis and nipples during the first leg as well as inserting his tongue into the victim’s mouth during the second leg. Instead, I have only _taken into consideration_ these uncharged actions by Goh in sentencing him for his charge.

87     Given the presence of the multitude of significant offence-specific aggravating factors in Goh’s offence but bearing in mind again that the charge did not involve any skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s penis, I found that Goh’s offence fell within the middle to upper end of Band 2 with a starting point of 12 months’ imprisonment.

88     In pegging the starting point at this range of Band 2, I was guided by the precedent in _Public Prosecutor v Liaqat Ali Khan_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 54</span> (“_Liaqat Ali Khan_”). In that case, the offender was also a passenger in a private hire vehicle and the victim was the driver. The offender touched the victim’s left thigh, kissed her left hand, touched her groin over her clothes, and pulled her left hand towards his groin. The District Judge accepted the Prosecution’s submissions on the applicable offence-specific aggravating factors as follows (at \[32\]–\[34\] and \[42\]): (a) the offender had intruded on multiple parts of the victim’s body; (b) the offender’s actions posed a danger to the victim’s safety and the safety of other road users; (c) the victim was a public transport provider; and (d) the harm caused to the victim was high because she did not return to work as a private hire driver since the incident. Based on these offence-specific factors, the District Court held that the indicative starting point was at least 14 months’ imprisonment and two strokes of the cane. However, on account of the offender’s age, one month’s imprisonment was imposed in lieu of caning. On appeal, the global sentence was reduced from 15 months’ imprisonment to 12 months’ imprisonment. No written judgment or grounds of decision were issued by the High Court. Nevertheless, based on the LawNet Editorial Note in _Liaqat Ali Khan_, it can be discerned that a sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment was found appropriate by the High Court for the offender’s actions (with an additional one month’s imprisonment imposed in lieu of caning).

89     In my judgment, Goh’s offence was clearly more aggravated than the precedent in _Liaqat Ali Khan_ as Goh had kissed the victim’s lips (as opposed to the kissing of hands in _Liaqat Ali Khan_). In addition to that, there were also other offence-specific aggravating factors in Goh’s case such as his voluntary intoxication as well as the earlier uncharged group sexual assault (including skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts).

90     Overall, in the absence of any relevant offender-specific factors, I found that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate for Goh.

91     As for caning, in line with the decision in _Liaqat Ali Khan_ at \[45\], I found that the two strokes of caning sought by the Prosecution was warranted. Notwithstanding the absence of any skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s penis, there was prolonged contact made by Goh with the victim’s penis over his pants, which made this an appropriate case for caning to be imposed (see _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span> at \[94\]).

### Neo’s sentence

92     For Neo’s sentence, applying again the _Kunasekaran_ framework, I found that his offence fell within the _upper_ end of Band 2. All the offence-specific factors highlighted in respect of Goh equally applied to Neo save as to the relevance of Goh’s uncharged conduct. Neo’s offence also posed a greater danger to road safety as his criminal actions were committed while the victim was driving along the _expressway_ during the first leg (see also _Liaqat Ali Khan_ at \[33\] and \[42\]).

93     Most materially, what rendered Neo’s charge more aggravated than Goh’s charge was the direct skin-to-skin contact made by the former with the victim’s penis. This contact was also prolonged and there were repeated acts of molest during the first leg of the journey. Based on the precedents highlighted by the Prosecution where there is skin-to-skin contact with a victim’s private parts, a sentence in the upper end of Band 2 is imposed. In the present case, considering the _intensity_ of the other offence-specific aggravating factors and in the absence of any mitigating offender-specific factors, I found that a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was appropriate.

## Concluding observation

94     The final outcome in which Goh received a lower sentence than Neo might be perceived as undesirable. Indeed, if one were to holistically consider the uncharged conduct of Goh alongside his charge, he could be adjudged to have done the same as what Neo did _and_ more. However, he was only charged for his actions during the second leg that did not involve any skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s penis. Nevertheless, in my judgment, the result of Goh’s sentence being lower than Neo’s is the inevitable outcome dictated by an application of the law. In this case, as the Prosecution acknowledged, the parity principle was inapplicable as both accused persons had been charged with separate offences with distinct particulars.

95     It is also not the role of the courts to question why the Prosecution had elected not to additionally charge Goh for his actions during the first leg of the journey or to even include the particulars of Goh’s conduct during the first leg in the same charge itself (this could have been done since the duration specified in the charge spanned the entire duration of the Grab journey). If either of this had been done, Goh would most likely have received a heavier sentence than Neo. In the circumstances, given the caution from Menon CJ in _GDC_ as mentioned above at \[86\], I have been careful to sentence Goh purely based on the particulars provided in his charge and have only taken into account his uncharged conduct as an _aggravating_ factor.
