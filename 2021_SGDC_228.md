19 October 2021 - Reserved Judgment

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is a male Singaporean. He is now 38 years old (D.O.B.: 15 October 1983).

2       On 31 March 2021, the Accused pleaded guilty to four charges. Three of the charges were for offences under s 28(2)(_a_) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the MLA”) read with s 28(3)(_b_)(i) of the MLA (collectively, “the MLA charges”). The fourth charge was for an offence under s 3 of the Vandalism Act (Cap 341, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the VA”).

3       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

4       The Accused then admitted to three more charges for offences under s 3 of the VA and four charges for offences under s 5(1) of the MLA punishable under s 14(1)(_b_)(i) read with s 14(1A)(_a_) of the MLA. He consented to have these seven charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

5       After considering the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following sentences:

6       Pursuant to s 307(1) of the Criminal Prosecutor Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”), I ordered the sentences of imprisonment in DAC-923419-2020 and DAC-923866-2020 to run consecutively. The other two sentences of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently. The aggregate sentence was thus 24 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Lastly, I ordered the sentence of imprisonment to take effect from 18 November 2020, which was the date of arrest of the Accused.

## Criminal Motion (No. 48 of 2021)

7       In May 2021, the Accused filed a Criminal Motion to the High Court seeking leave of the High Court for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal.

8       In June 2021, the motion was allowed pursuant to s 408A(1) of the CPC. The Accused duly filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence.

9       Arising therefrom, I now provide my grounds of decision.

## Statement of Facts

10     The SOF is reproduced in full below:

> **I**.     **INTRODUCTION**

> 1.    The accused is Vinod Kumar Gopalakrishnan, a 37-year-old male Malaysian bearing FIN No. XXX. His date of birth is 30 October 1983

> 2.    Sometime in 2020, the accused borrowed from an unlicensed moneylender after responding to an advertisement on his mobile phone. As he fell short on the payments, he borrowed from other unlicensed moneylenders to repay his debts. He said he borrowed about $13,000 from almost 10 unlicensed moneylenders in total. In September 2020, an unlicensed moneylender known to the accused as “X” offered to consolidate his debts. In return, the accused assisted X between September 2020 and October 2020 in carrying on his business of moneylending by performing fund transfers, giving his ATM cards and their PINs to X, and allowing X to use his WhatsApp account.

> 3.    When the accused’s bank accounts were frozen in October 2020, X offered to pay the accused $200 for each residence he harasses on his behalf. The accused accepted his offer. Over a period of six days, between 12 November 2020 and 17 November 2020, the accused harassed seven residences.

> **II**.     **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1ST CHARGE (DAC-923419-2020)**

> 4.    On 12 November 2020, the accused bought a can of yellow paint for $18. He transferred the paint into a plastic bag. At or about 2.40pm, he reached Blk 772 Bedok Reservoir View, #XXX, Singapore (“the Bedok Unit”). While acting on behalf of X, the accused committed an act likely to cause annoyance to the occupant of the Bedok Unit, Yong Zin Lin (“Yong”), by splashing yellow paint on the door of the Bedok Unit. This act was in connection with the $300 loan that Yong previously took from an unlicensed moneylender. The accused caused damage to property in the course of committing the act.

> 5.    The accused sent a photograph of the Bedok Unit to X and left the place. At 2.49pm, Yong received the photograph from an unknown person on WhatsApp along with a message that his Unit would be burnt next time. On 13 November 2020 at 1.33am, Yong called ‘999’ and informed, “My unit had been splashed with paint at 3pm but I went to work and come back, can you send police now to investigate?” He said the incident happened at the Bedok Unit. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence under section 28(2)(_a_) read with section 28(3)(_b_)(i) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed).

> **III**.     **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 4TH CHARGE (DAC-923867-2020)**

> 6.    On 13 November 2020, at or about 1pm, X instructed the accused to harass a unit located at Blk 813A Choa Chu Kang Avenue 7 #XXX, Singapore (“the Choa Chu Kang Unit”). The accused bought a can of green paint for $18 and transferred some of it into a plastic bottle. He arrived at the Choa Chu Kang Unit at or about 2.56pm. He committed an act of vandalism by splashing green paint on the door of the Choa Chu Kang Unit, which is a private property. This was done without the consent of the occupier of the Choa Chu Kang Unit, Diana Aryanny binte Abdullah (“Diana”). Diana was not a debtor of any unlicensed moneylender.

> 7.    The accused sent a photograph of the Choa Chu Kang Unit to X and left the place. Diana discovered the act of vandalism on 16 November 2020 at around 6pm. At 6.46pm, Diana called ‘999’ and informed, “Someone has splashed paint at my door and gate. It could happened on Friday.” She said the incident happened at the Choa Chu Kang Unit. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence under section 3 of the Vandalism Act.

> **IV**.     **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 3RD CHARGE (DAC-923866-2020)**

> 8.    On 16 November 2020, X instructed the accused to harass two locations. At or about 4.02pm, the accused arrived at Blk 738 Woodlands Circle #XXX, Singapore (“the Woodlands Unit”). While acting on behalf of X, the accused committed an act likely to cause annoyance to the occupant of the Woodlands Unit, Gan Sze Zhuo (“Gan”), by splashing green paint on the door of the Woodlands Unit. The act was in connection with the $400 loan that Gan’s boyfriend, Liu Changwei, previously took from an unlicensed moneylender. The accused caused damage to property in the course of committing the act.

> 9.    The accused sent a photograph of the Woodlands Unit to X and left the place. Gan received the photograph from an unknown person at 4.18pm, along with a message that demanded payment of $3,000. Gan called ‘999’ at 5.32pm and informed, “I received a photo from UML with my unit gate splashed with paint earlier at 4.18pm.” She said the incident happened at the Woodlands Unit. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence under section 28(2)(_a_) read with section 28(3)(_b_)(i) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed).

> **V**.     **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 5TH CHARGE (DAC-923868-2020)**

> 10.    On 17 November 2020, at or about 1.30pm, X instructed the accused to harass two locations. The accused filled a plastic bottle with green paint while he was at work. He arrived at Blk 331 Serangoon Avenue 3 #XXX, Singapore (“the Serangoon Unit”) at or about 4.14pm. While acting on behalf of X, the accused committed an act likely to cause annoyance to the occupant of the Serangoon Unit, Irma Lestari Rahardja (“Irma”), by splashing green paint on the door of the Serangoon Unit. The act was in connection with the $300 loan that Irma’s neighbour who resided at #XXX, namely Mapili Joana Marie Serna (“Mapili”), previously took from an unlicensed moneylender. The accused caused damage to property in the course of committing the act.

> 11.    The accused sent a photograph of the Serangoon Unit to X and left the place. Mapili received the photograph of the Serangoon Unit from an unknown number along with a demand for a “cancellation fee” of $1,500. At 4.46pm, Mapili called ‘999’ and informed, “Someone outside my house”. She said the incident happened at Blk 331 Serangoon Avenue 3 #XXX, Singapore. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence under section 28(2)(_a_) read with section 28(3)(_b_)(i) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed).

> **VI**.     **ARREST**

> 12.    On 18 November 2020 at 2.40pm, the police arrested the accused at his workplace, Bruno’s Pizzeria & Grill, at 344 Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore. The following items were seized from the accused as case exhibits: (1) one black ‘Giordano’ T-shirt; (2) one Mi mobile phone in a black casing; (3) one black ‘Sportxilie’ backpack; and (4) one pair of black ‘Neckermann’ slippers.

> 13.    The accused admits to the commission of the offences above and stands charged accordingly.

## Antecedent

11     The Accused does not have any criminal antecedent.

## Prosecutive Address on Sentence

12     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 20 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

### The MLA charges

13     In respect of the charges under the MLA, the Prosecution highlighted Parliament’s intention to deter the commission of offences related to unlicensed moneylending. Such offences threaten the safety of a wider scope of persons beyond the debtors and their sureties. Acts of harassment, such as damage to property or warning messages scrawled on common areas, would invariably create an atmosphere of fear in the neighbourhood and a breach if good public order. The response of the courts should therefore be both punitive and deterrent: _Public Prosecutor v Soh Yew Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 49</span> at \[15\].

14     The benchmark sentence for harassment cases with property damage, not involving the use of fire, is 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of caning: _Public Prosecutor v Nelson Jeyaraj s/o Chandran_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1130</span> at \[47\] (“_Nelson Jeyaraj_”).

15     The said sentencing benchmark was re-affirmed in _Public Prosecutor v Quek Li Hao_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 471</span> (“_Quek Li Hao_”). In _Quek Li Hao_, the offender took up jobs with unlicensed moneylenders to set off his debts. The job entailed splashing paint on debtors’ flat and scrawling graffiti on stairwell walls. The offender had also harassed one particular debtor’s neighbour by splashing paint on the neighbour’s unit. The offender pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, four charges of harassment with property damage (“the harassment charges”) and one charge of assisting an unlicensed moneylender (“the assisting moneylender charge”). Seven other charges of harassment on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender was a first offender. The District Judge (“DJ”) sentenced the offender to seven months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for each of the harassment charges and to one month’s imprisonment and $30,000 (in default, three weeks’ imprisonment) for the assisting moneylender charge. The DJ ordered two of the imprisonment terms for the harassment charges to run consecutively. The aggregate sentence was therefore 14 months’ imprisonment, 12 strokes of the cane and a fine of $30,000. The Prosecution appealed against the sentences imposed by the DJ on the harassment charges. The Prosecution’s appeal was allowed. The High Court imposed 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for each of the four harassment charges and ordered two of the imprisonment terms to run consecutively. The offender’s total sentence (inclusive of the assisting moneylender charge) was 24 months’ imprisonment, 12 strokes of the cane. and a fine of $30,000.

16     The Prosecution submitted that there were no factors in the present case that would justify a departure from the benchmark sentence. Thus, the starting indicative sentence should be 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for each of the MLA charges.

### The VA charge

17     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment for the VA charge. The Prosecution referred to the following two cases:

> (a)      _Public Prosecutor v Nur Afiza binte Sapeh_ (Criminal Revision No.5 of 2020, unreported) (“_Nur Afiza_”). The offender pasted 61 pieces of notes containing harassing contents on the door and electrical riser of a housing unit as well as on the walls beside the said unit and at the common corridor outside the said unit. The offence of vandalism under s 3 of the VA vandalism was committed by the offender on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender for monetary gains. Two other charges under s 3 of the VA were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The High Court imposed a sentence of four months’ imprisonment; and

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Chua Boon Liang_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No. 256 of 1992, unreported) (“_Chua Boon Liang_”). The offender pleaded guilty to two offences under the MLA and one charge of vandalism for writing harassing content on an HDB lift door. The offender was a first offender and he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment on the vandalism charge.

18     The Prosecution submitted that the present case was more aggravated than _Chua Boon Liang’s_ case as the Accused had caused property damage by splashing paint on the door of the victim’s unit and two other similar charges were taken into consideration. These aggravating factors would bring the case on par with _Nur Afiza’s_ case. The Prosecution thus argued that a sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment should be imposed for the VA charge.

### Consecutive Sentencing

19     The Prosecution highlighted that the three MLA charges were distinct offences as they were committed at different locations on different day involving different victims. The Prosecution submitted that two sentences for the MLA offences should run consecutively as an offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence by way of consecutive sentences: _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> at \[41\]. This was to avoid any impression that an offender who had committed multiple offences might benefit from some form of bulk discount in sentencing.

20     Finally, in its application of the totality principle in sentencing, the Prosecution submitted that to ensure that the aggregate sentence is proportionate and in keeping to the totality of the offending, the individual sentences for the MLA charges should be adjusted downwards by two months. Thus, in the Prosecution’s view, the aggregate sentence appropriate for the present case is 20 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

## Defence’s Plea-in-Mitigation and Address on Sentence

21     The Accused submitted a handwritten plea-in-mitigation. In his mitigation, the Accused stated that he had been working in Singapore for about three and a half years and was law abiding all the time. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic situation led to a financial crisis for his family in Malaysia. He then took loans from unlicensed moneylenders to support his family and siblings. When he could not repay the loans to the unlicensed moneylenders, he was harassed and threatened by the unlicensed moneylenders. He then took up the offer of work and some forms of settlement cum repayment of his debts from one of unlicensed moneylenders (see also \[2\] of the SOF). The Accused claimed that in the harassment acts, he had used water-based paint, instead of permanent paint, so that the victims could wash away the paint. The Accused was aware that what he had done was wrong and he admitted to his wrongdoings. He informed the court that he had committed the offences because of his inability to repay his loans to the unlicensed moneylenders.

22     The Accused informed that court that he was supporting his wife, one biological daughter and two adopted daughters. The family was struggling financially. The Accused sought the court’s compassion and leniency in sentencing him.

## Court’s decision on sentence

23     In coming to my decision on the appropriate sentences to be imposed for the MLA charges and the VA charge, I have considered the relevant aggravating factors and the Accused’s plea of guilt which has saved courts’ time and resources. That said, the plea of guilt had to be weighed against the strength of the evidence, which was very strong, for each of the proceeded charges. I was also mindful of the sentencing benchmark for the MLA charges. Finally, I did not find the Accused’s personal and family circumstances to be exceptional to warrant a discount in sentencing.

### Individual Sentences for the MLA charge and the VA charge

24     In respect of the MLA charges, it was my assessment that the Prosecution had correctly applied the sentencing benchmark in _Nelson Jeyaraj_ to the facts of this case. As such, I began with a starting indicative sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for each count of the MLA charges. Other than the Accused’s plea of guilt, there weren’t any facts or mitigating factors that would warrant a departure from the benchmark sentence. The Accused’s plea of guilt was counter-balanced by the charges taken into consideration. In my assessment, a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane would be appropriate for each count of the three MLA charges.

25     In respect of VA charge, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission in its entirety. As such, I imposed a sentence of four months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for the VA charge.

### Aggregate Sentence

26     I agree with the Prosecution’s submission (see \[19\] above) that two terms of imprisonment for the MLA offences should run consecutively. The terms of imprisonment for the remaining MLA charge and the VA charge shall run concurrently to the above.

27     However, I was unable to agree with the Prosecution’s submission that there should be a downward calibration of the total sentence. In my assessment, the overall criminality of the Accused was similar to _Quek Li Hao’s_. The Accused should not be getting a punishment lesser than _Quek Li Hao_. In the circumstances, following my decisions in \[24\] to \[26\] above, the aggregate sentence imposed on the Accused was 24 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane.

28     The Accused was arrested on 18 November 2020 and kept in legal custody since. I therefore ordered the sentence of imprisonment to take effect from 18 November 2020.
