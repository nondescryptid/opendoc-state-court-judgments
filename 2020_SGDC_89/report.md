### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The Accused’s chequered past has cast a long shadow over his life.

2       With a string of antecedents for property, drug-related and violent offences, his past assumed a certain salience in the present case. He pleaded guilty to 3 charges under ss 379, 323 and 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) punishable under s 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed).

3       The sentencing submissions pulled in different directions. The Defence sought an imprisonment term of 21 months and 72 days. As against this, the Prosecution pressed for 5 years’ Corrective Training. The formative arc of Corrective Training (“CT”) was traced in _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 209</span>, where the 3-Judge Panel laid out an analytical framework for CT.

4       At its heart, this framework balances a melange of sentencing principles – escalation, consecutive sentences, totality, crime prevention, proportionality, and the reformation and rehabilitation of offenders.

5       Where do the scales of justice lie on this broad canvas? All things considered, the Accused was imprisoned for 33 months and 72 days.

6       In my judgment, I considered that imposing the minimum term of five years of CT would be unduly disproportionate. I will explain briefly.

7       The Accused’s antecedents gave me pause. As he was a persistent habitual offender, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Escalation principle was engaged and to have all three of his custodial sentences run consecutively. The Accused would therefore have been sentenced to regular imprisonment for a period of about 33 months.

8       Both parties accepted that the Accused would qualify for the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS). On the basis that he is released after serving two-thirds of a 33-month imprisonment term (i.e. after serving 22 months), the Accused would thereafter be eligible for around 11 months of mandatory aftercare under the MAS. He could then be placed in a “step-down” programme as contemplated under the MAS, such that he might have the opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.

9       In the final analysis, a sentence of regular imprisonment (which takes into account the Escalation principle and the consecutive sentence exception) twinned with the MAS would adequately fulfil the dual aims of specifically deterring and rehabilitating the Accused. In the present case, imposing the minimum term of five years of CT would be unduly disproportionate.

10     The Statement of Facts can be found at **Annex A**. My grounds of decision are summarised below at \[112\].[^1]

11     No appeal has been lodged. I now set out my detailed reasons.

## ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

12     The two-stage framework in _Sim Yeow Kee_ is as follows:

> (a)      First Stage: Whether the offender qualifies for the CT regime under s 304(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

> (b)      Second Stage: Whether it is expedient to sentence the offender to CT with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime.[^2]

13     For the second stage, there is a 3-step process:

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image1.png)

14     Briefly, my answers are:

> (a)     ‘Yes’ to the First Stage, and

> (b)     ‘No’ to the Second Stage.

## A.    First Stage: Does the Offender Qualify for Corrective Training?

15     Yes, the Accused qualified for Corrective Training under s 304(1) of the CPC.[^3] This is a threshold question.

## B.    Second Stage: Is it Expedient to Sentence the Offender to Corrective Training with a view to his Reformation and the Prevention of Crime?

## (i)   Step 1: What are the Likely Imprisonment Sentences?

## (a)   Prescribed Punishment

16      **Section 379 Cap 224**. The prescribed punishment for s 379 Cap 224 is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.

17      **Section 323 Cap 224**. The prescribed punishment for s 323 Cap 224 is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

18      **Section 380 Cap 224**. The prescribed punishment for s 380 Cap 224 is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to a fine.

19     An offence’s statutory maximum sentence signals the gravity in which Parliament views such offences. A sentencing judge ought therefore to take this into account when determining precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the entire range of punishment devised by Parliament.[^4] Put another way, the court should ensure that the full spectrum of sentences enacted by Parliament is carefully explored in determining the appropriate sentence.[^5]

20     For completeness, if it is not possible to determine the “normal level of sentences” for the Totality Principle, the midpoint of the maximum prescribed sentence might be a useful proxy: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 221</span> at \[94\].

21     We turn next to the Escalation principle.

## (b)   Escalation Principle

22     The Escalation principle is no more than a reformulation of the longstanding principle that specific deterrence may justify a longer term of imprisonment being imposed on a persistent offender in light of his antecedents, if these reflected a tendency for repeat offending or a marked proclivity toward criminal offending.[^6]

23     The appropriateness of escalation requires a scrupulous assessment of the particular factual matrix.[^7] This is by no means a mechanical exercise. The court is required to assess whether the objective of preventing re-offending is in fact met by the use of escalation.[^8]

24     Applying the Escalation principle incorporates the safeguard of proportionality. Hence, before a court imposes an uplift on an accused person’s previous sentences, there must be a careful comparison with the accused person’s previous offending.[^9]

25     In order to have the correct factual basis for applying the Escalation principle, in addition to the Criminal Records Office record, it might sometimes be helpful or necessary to refer to, among other things, the charges, statement of facts, psychiatric reports, and grounds of decision (where available). It is not every case where this will be called for – but certainly where the Escalation principle is in play, a court should endeavour to have as complete a picture as practicable.[^10]

26     In this connection, I asked for and considered the charges, statement of facts, and mitigation plea pertaining to the Accused’s antecedents in 2015 and 2018.

27     Ultimately, the assessment for the Escalation principle is necessarily a fact-specific and contextual one, requiring a judgment of experience and discernment.[^11]

28     I agreed with both the Prosecution and Defence that the Escalation principle was engaged in the present case.[^12] The Defence pointed out that for the Accused’s theft and violence-related antecedents, the heftiest sentence awarded did not exceed 2 years,[^13] and there was ample room for escalation as s 380 Cap 224 provides for a maximum term of 7 years.[^14]

29     For my analysis of the harm, culpability, mitigating and aggravating factors in the present case, please see below at \[73\]-\[90\].

30     All things considered, the Accused’s likely sentence would be imprisonment for a period of about 33 months, as detailed in the table below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image2.png)

31     We segue to the issue of consecutive sentences.

## (c)   Consecutive Sentences

32     There is a general rule of consecutive sentences for unrelated offences: Court of Appeal in _Muhammad Sutarno bin Nasir v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 43</span> at \[22\] endorsing _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> at \[41\]-\[46\].[^15]

33     In the present case, all three of the proceeded charges arose from separate incidents and were committed on different dates.[^16] In particular, the voluntarily causing hurt offence under s 323 Cap 224[^17] violated a completely different legally-protected interest from the theft offences.[^18] The theft offences involved different victims, and there was no unity of purpose or design in the commission of the theft offences.[^19]

34     Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution to have all three of his custodial sentences run consecutively.[^20]

## (d)   Interplay of Harm, Culpability & Mitigating/ Aggravating Factors

35     At its heart, the interplay of

> (a)     Harm,

> (b)     Culpability, and

> (c)     Mitigating/ Aggravating factors (“**Analytical Framework**”) lends itself well to sentencing.

36     Harm is a measure of the injury that has been caused to society by the commission of the offence.[^21] Harm may:

> (a)     Cleave into “physical harm” and “psychological harm” for maid abuse cases under s 323 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code: _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 42</span> at \[70\]-\[72\]; and

> (b)     Include serious economic loss to the victim under s 17(1) of the Medical Registration Act: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 188</span> at \[69\].

37     As an aside, the nature of harm (i.e. whether the harm is physical or intangible) is considered by Singapore’s Model Artificial Intelligence Governance Framework (Second Edition, 21 January 2020),[^22] which also harnesses a severity/ probability of harm matrix.

38     Culpability is a measure of the degree of relative blameworthiness disclosed by an offender’s actions and is measured chiefly in relation to the extent and manner of the offender’s involvement in the criminal act.[^23]

39     The Analytical Framework for offences under ss 379, 323 and 380 of the Penal Code may be curated as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image3.png)

40     Two observations can be made in relation to the Analytical Framework:

> (a)     The synergistic interplay between harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing.

> (b)     The eclectic ensemble of cases adopting the Analytical Framework is testament to its versatility.

41     First, the synergistic interplay of harm, culpability, aggravating and mitigating factors enhances sentencing. While facts are the cornerstone, harm and culpability are the pillars on which we place the cross-beams of aggravating and mitigating factors.

42     The typical framework consists of a 2-step sentencing bands framework as found in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span> at \[73(a), (c) and (d)\].[^24]

43     At the first step, the court should have regard to the _offence-specific_ factors in deciding which band the offence in question falls under. Offence-specific factors comprise factors going towards: (a) the harm caused by the offence; and (b) the offender’s culpability.[^25]

44     These categories may not always be watertight.[^26] For instance, the degree of planning and premeditation and the level of sophistication, were categorised as offence-specific factors going towards the offender’s _culpability_ in _Logachev Vladislav_. Yet, the High Court observed that they may also relate to the _harm_ caused by the offence in so far as they affect the likelihood of harm: _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> at \[38\].

45     Once the sentencing band, which defines the range of sentences which may usually be imposed for an offence with those features, is identified, the court has to go on to identify precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an “indicative starting point”.

46     At the second step, the court should have regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the sentence. These _offender-specific_ factors comprise other aggravating and mitigating factors which do not directly relate to the commission of the offence.[^27]

47     I pause here to note that a slight variant of the 2-step sentencing bands framework finds expression in drug trafficking and importation cases where the quantity of the drugs indicates the potential harm to society.  In this regard, the indicative starting sentence – based on the quantity of the drugs (_viz._ potential harm) – may be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors.  Essentially, _harm_ is the fulcrum for such cases.

48     Examples of these cases include _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span> at \[43\]-\[48\] (drug trafficking)[^28] and _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 25</span> at \[29\]-\[30\] (drug importation).[^29]

49     In similar vein, for voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code, the seriousness of the injury caused (_viz._ harm) is a good indicator of the gravity of the offence and guides the court in determining the indicative starting point for sentencing. The indicative starting sentence may then be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offenders’ culpability and other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 69</span> at \[55\].[^30]  The same approach applies for s 323 of the Penal Code: _Low Song Chyev Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> at \[76\]-\[78\].

50     Another model of the 2-step sentencing bands framework can be found in fatal accident cases under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code. For such cases, as the harm is the death of the victim, the harm is generally uniform. Accordingly, what sets such cases apart is, in the vast majority of cases, determined primarily by the accused’s _culpability_.[^31]  After considering the accused’s culpability, a sentencing court takes into account other aggravating and mitigating factors: _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[54\]. 

51     Finally, in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> at \[52\], \[57\] and \[60\],[^32] the 3-Judge Panel noted that the:

> “offence-specific and offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors are necessarily factored into the analysis within the harm and culpability considerations themselves”.

52     An example of this approach may be found in _Public Prosecutor v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 178</span> at \[50\]-\[56\], where the 3-Judge Panel held that exceptional performance during National Service was not a _mitigating_ factor, as it reduces neither the defaulter’s _culpability_ nor the _harm_ he had caused by his offence.

53     For completeness, in lieu of using the 2-step sentencing bands framework as a starting point for sentencing, the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chai Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 272</span>[^33] stated that the starting inquiry in sentencing offenders with a mental disorder ought to be whether the deterrent, retributive and protective principles of sentencing prevail over the principle of rehabilitation. 

## Synopsis

54     In sum, the above discussion can be condensed as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image4.png)

56     I was mindful that in assessing the level of harm or potential harm, the sentencing court should be careful not to double-count any factors which may already have been taken into account in assessing the level of culpability: _Neo Ah Luan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 188</span> at \[70\].[^46]

> (See also Andrew Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ (6th Edition, 2015, Cambridge University Press) at \[4.3\] and \[4.5\])

## (ii)   Step 2: Would the Accused be placed on the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS)?

57     Both parties accepted that the Accused would qualify for the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme (MAS). I agreed. The Accused had been convicted of an offence under the First Schedule to the Prisons Act – for example, ss 379 and 380 Cap 224 with drug-related antecedents – and he is likely to receive an aggregate imprisonment term exceeding 1 year: s 50U(1)(b) of the Prisons Act.[^47]

58     In addition to the MAS, the Defence pointed out that the Accused had taken proactive steps at reform as a volunteer at Hira Society, a Voluntary Welfare Organisation that helps ex-drug survivors and their families reintegrate back into society.[^48]

59     Meanwhile, the Prosecution finessed their argument for the MAS as follows. The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused had previously been placed on the MAS, from 11 January 2016 to 24 June 2016.[^49] However, the Accused had failed to complete the MAS programme on that occasion and was remanded on 25 April 2016 after committing a fresh offence.[^50] Despite having had the opportunity to avail himself of the structured aftercare programmes offered under the MAS, this has patently had little assistance in his rehabilitation and reintegration into society.[^51] The Prosecution thus submitted that this raised serious doubts on whether it can be said that further availability of the MAS would be of benefit to the Accused.[^52]

60     I did not agree with the Prosecution’s submission. The Accused’s previous stint in the MAS was forged on the anvil of a short 3.5-month period from 11 January 2016 to 25 April 2016. In contrast, the MAS is generally for a period of up to two years, allowing three phases – a halfway house stay, home supervision and community reintegration, although not all individuals will have to go through the three phases: Mr Masagos Zulkifli, then Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, at the second reading of the Bill introducing the MAS \[_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (20 January 2014) vol. 91\].[^53]

61     The MAS has brought to the fore the fact that rehabilitative programmes are commendably and intrinsically embedded in the imprisonment regime in general.[^54]

62     In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the MAS would not benefit the Accused.

## (iii)   Step 3: Would a sentence of Corrective Training be Unduly Disproportionate?

63     For the balancing exercise in _Sim Yeow Kee_, two considerations (rehabilitative benefits of the MAS and whether CT would be unduly disproportionate) bear weight to a greater degree when a shorter term of CT is contemplated.[^55] The 3-Judge Panel in _Sim Yeow Kee_ recognised that its sentencing framework is likely to reduce the scope for imposing CT sentences.[^56]

64     For the Prosecution’s sentencing submissions at \[47\]-\[52\], these points can be dealt with under the rubric of the Escalation principle, consecutive sentence exception,[^57] and enhanced punishment under s 50T of the Prison Act.[^58] The Prosecution’s sentencing precedents (post-_Sim Yeow Kee_)[^59] can be distinguished as in all of these cases save for one,[^60] their likely imprisonment sentences were 5 years and beyond.[^61] And many of these offenders were not eligible for the MAS.[^62]

65     In the present case, I considered that imposing the minimum term of five years of CT would be unduly disproportionate. As he was a persistent habitual offender, I agreed with the Prosecution that the Escalation principle was engaged and to have all three custodial sentences run consecutively.[^63] The Accused would therefore have been sentenced to a period of around 33 months of regular imprisonment.[^64]

66     Both parties accepted that the Accused would qualify for the MAS. On the basis that he is released after serving two-thirds of a 33-month imprisonment term (i.e. after serving 22 months), the Accused would thereafter be eligible for around 11 months of mandatory aftercare under the MAS.[^65] He could then be placed in a “step-down” programme as contemplated under the MAS, such that he might have the opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.[^66]

67     In my judgment, having applied the first two steps under Stage 2, I found that a sentence of regular imprisonment (which takes into account the Escalation principle and the consecutive sentence exception) twinned with the MAS would adequately fulfil the dual aims of specifically deterring and rehabilitating the Accused.[^67] Imposing the minimum term of five years CT mandated by s 304(1) of the CPC would be unduly disproportionate.[^68]

68     In sum, I considered that imposing the minimum term of five years of CT would be unduly disproportionate. My view is fortified by the graph below.

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image5.png)

69     The difference is even starker between CT and the Accused’s likely imprisonment term _after remission_ (see the second graph below). This is brought to sharper focus by the fact that almost all regular prison inmates will qualify for remission.[^69] In contrast, CT entails a mandatory minimum of 5 years’ incarceration for the offender and does not carry an automatic right to remission. This becomes relevant in circumstances where the sentence of regular imprisonment that would likely be imposed on the offender for the underlying offence is appreciably shorter than the minimum statutorily-prescribed term of CT.[^70]

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image6.png)

70     To be clear, my decision not to order a sentence of CT was informed by the holistic approach in _Sim Yeow Kee_ that balances different factors, and my decision did not hinge on vectors such as statistics or graphs.

71     I was mindful that the 3-Judge Panel in _Lee Shing Chan and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 41</span> at \[34\] made clear its preference for a more holistic approach since sentencing is not a scientific exercise and does not demand mathematical precision, which is quite impractical in any case when dealing with human beings and the multifarious situations in the cases.

72     This emphasis on a more holistic approach to sentencing was echoed by the High Court in _S Elamparithi v Public Prosecutor_ (oral judgment, MA 9238/2019) at \[20\], i.e. sentencing is not a scientific exercise demanding mathematical precision; it is a matter of judicial discretion to be approached with a judicious measure of pragmatism and common sense, having regard to the offender-specific and offence-specific factors. This was what I have endeavoured to do in the present case.

## APPROPRIATE SENTENCE

73      **Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions** **.** The Prosecution asked for a 5-year CT sentence.[^71]

74      **Mitigation Plea** **.** The Defence stated that the Accused was remorseful and his plea of guilt had saved considerable costs and time.[^72]

75     The Defence pointed out that the Accused had volunteered at Hira Society, a Voluntary Welfare Organisation that helps ex-drug survivors and their families reintegrate back into society.[^73] I gave this due weight in sentencing.

76     The founder of Hira Society provided a positive testimonial for the Accused, which has been reproduced verbatim below:

77     The Defence sought an imprisonment term of 21 months and 72 days:[^75]

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image7.png)

## (i) Harm/ Culpability

78      **Value of Stolen Items**. The value of the stolen items was not high. For s 379 Cap 224, it was a Samsung handphone valued at S$190.[^76] For s 380 Cap 224, the value of the stolen items[^77] was unknown but unlikely to be high.[^78] While the value of the stolen items was not high for the theft offences, this was outweighed by the need for specific deterrence.[^79]

79      **Injuries**. For the s 323 Cap 224 charge, the victim suffered three lacerations and one small cephalohaematoma on his head.[^80] The injuries were to a vulnerable part of the body, _viz._ back of the head.[^81] Based on the injuries sustained, the present case falls within Band 1 where the indicative starting range for a first offender is a fine or short custodial term of up to four weeks: _Low Song Chyev Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> at \[77\].

80     For completeness, I noted that there was no commotion or dispute between the victim and the accused before the assault. [^82]

81      **Weapon**. For the s 323 Cap 224 charge, the Accused had used a weapon (glass beer bottle) to attack the victim.[^83]

82     I agreed with the Prosecution that this is an inherently dangerous weapon made of glass, and the fact that it had smashed upon impact on the victim’s head indicates the substantial amount of force used by the Accused.[^84] As the sharp edges of a broken bottle can potentially cause deep lacerations and serious bodily injuries, it is fortuitous that more serious injuries were not caused.[^85]

83     A similar factual matrix can be found in _Vadivelu s/o Nallaiya v Pubic Prosecutor_ (MA 89/98/01): _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (3rd Edition, 2013) at page 261.[^86] However, this unreported case was of limited assistance because there were no written grounds of decision to explain the reasons behind imposing its 8-month custodial sentence: _Muhammad Khalis bin Ramlee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 116</span> at \[64\]. Furthermore, any similarities were more apparent than real with regard to _Vadivelu s/o Nallaiya_ as in that case, the offender was convicted after trial for the more serious charge of s 324 Cap 224.

84      **Premeditation**. There was no premeditation for the theft offences.[^87]

## (ii)   Mitigating/ Aggravating Factors

85      **Plea of Guilt**. I gave due weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt.[^88]

86      **Restitution**. No restitution was made for the theft offences.[^89]

87      **TIC Charges**. The effect of taking into consideration outstanding charges is to enhance the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed for the proceeded charges.[^90] In the present case, three charges were taken into consideration for sentencing purposes.[^91]

88     For the s 379 Cap 224 charge,[^92] I agreed with the Prosecution that there should be an uplift in the sentence because it was similar to the TIC offence.[^93] Moreover, the s 379 Cap 224 offence[^94] was committed while the Accused was being investigated for earlier offences.[^95]

89     For the s 380 Cap 224 charge,[^96] I agreed with the Prosecution that there should be an uplift in the sentence because it was similar to the TIC offence.[^97] In addition, there was another TIC charge for criminal trespass under s 447 Cap 224.[^98]

90      **Antecedents**. The Accused had many antecedents, including theft,[^99] fraudulent possession of property, drug possession and consumption, drunkenness in public place, and violence-related offences.[^100] The Prosecution rightly pointed out that the Accused had committed similar offences in 2015 and 2018, such as using a glass bottle to voluntarily cause hurt[^101] and stealing a handphone from a vehicle.[^102]

91      **Sentence** **.** All things considered, I sentenced the Accused as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image8.png)

92     In the present case, the total enhanced sentence was capped at 72 days: ss 50T(1)(a) and 50T(2)(b) of the Prisons Act.[^103] For a recent and comprehensive analysis of s 50T, see _Public Prosecutor v Mohamad Dom Bin Matsaad_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 11</span>.[^104]

93     For completeness, I was aware that my sentence for two charges – s 323 Cap 224 p/u s 50T(2)(b)[^105] and s 380 Cap 224 p/u s 50T(2)(b)[^106] – was lower than that sought by the Defence.

94     Ultimately, sentencing lies exclusively within the court’s prerogative.[^107] Where the penalty prescribed for an offence extends across a range, the question of where the offence falls within that range is squarely for the court’s determination. Therefore, while the Prosecution and Defence are expected to assist the court in this task, it is ultimately for the court to assess and determine what sentence would be just in the light of all the circumstances before it.

95     Just as the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence is not, and should not be regarded as, the _upper_ limit of the sentence that may be meted out, the Defence’s submissions on sentence is not necessarily the _lower_ limit of the sentence that a court may impose: _Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 161</span> at \[12\].

## (iii)   Totality Principle

96     I hewed to the principles in _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span>, and considered both limbs of the Totality principle.[^108]

97      **First Limb** **:** Whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the _normal_ level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. This calls for a comparison between the total sentence on the one hand and a yardstick on the other hand.

98     The Totality principle contemplates comparing the aggregate sentence with the _range_ of sentences normally imposed for the most serious offence, rather than with a specific sentencing benchmark or starting point.[^109] The court should not focus only on the upper limit of the sentencing range. Instead, the court should give due regard to the whole sentencing range and the relevant aggravating or mitigating factors present in the particular case to assess whether, on the whole, the sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offence.[^110]

99     If it is not possible to determine the “_normal_ level of sentences”, the midpoint of the maximum prescribed sentence might be a useful proxy: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 221</span> at \[94\].

100     **Second Limb** **:** Whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects: _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> at \[54\]-\[57\].

101    A “crushing sentence” is one that destroys any hope of recovery and reintegration of the offender: _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 69</span> at \[67\].[^111]

102    The Totality principle requires the court to take a ‘last look’ at all the facts and circumstances and assess whether the sentence looks wrong.[^112] If so, consideration ought to be given to whether the aggregate sentence should be reduced. This may be done by re-assessing which of the appropriate sentences ought to run consecutively.[^113] In addition, it could also be done by re-calibrating the individual sentences so as to arrive at an appropriate aggregate sentence.[^114]

103    In the present case, the sentences are in line with both limbs of the Totality principle.

104    At this juncture, I pause to note that far from being a monochrome, the Totality principle has a many-splendoured piquancy. Four examples would suffice. First, in _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> at \[18\]-\[23\], the High Court stated that as a matter of logic, the Totality principle is equally capable of having a _boosting effect_ on individual sentences where they would otherwise result in a manifestly inadequate overall sentence.[^115] This is because the Totality principle requires not only that the overall sentence not be excessive but also that it not be inadequate.[^116]

105    Second, the Totality principle applies to a cumulative sentence of _caning_ imposed for several distinct offences.[^117] Where there are multiple convictions for similar offences, a court is entitled to vary the number of strokes to be imposed for each charge on account of the Totality principle: _Ho Sheng Yu Garreth v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 375</span> at \[133\]. This would, of course, be subject to the mandatory minimum number of strokes as stipulated by the statutory provisions. Conversely, the aggregate sentence of caning cannot exceed the specified limit of 24 strokes: s 328(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). This specified limit acts as a statutory breakwater for the aggregate sentence of caning.

106    Third, the Totality principle also applies to _multiple fines_, where the totality principle may allow for the adjustment of individual fines so that the cumulative fine is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality. This, however, would be subject to any contrary statutory provisions having mandatory force: _Seng Foo Building Construction Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 243</span> at \[4\], \[63\], \[72\], and \[80\].[^118] With regard to multiple fines, the sentencing court needs to also calibrate carefully the in-default imprisonment terms. This is because the Totality principle may be infringed if the sentencing court overlooks the fact that in-default imprisonment terms runs consecutively.

107    Fourth, in my view, the Totality principle is engaged for driving disqualification orders, subject to any mandatory minimum driving disqualification periods as stipulated by the statutory provisions.

108    The Totality principle would have a lesser impact on driving disqualification orders vis-à-vis other types of punishment (imprisonment, fines and caning) because driving disqualification orders do not run consecutively. That said, when an accused person is charged with different types of driving offences and driving disqualification orders are meted out – these disqualification orders may, depending on the statutory provisions in question, start from the date of a person’s conviction or where the person is sentenced to imprisonment, on the date of the person’s release from prison.[^119]

109    Finally, a possible way to ascertain the range of sentences normally imposed is to refer to the Sentencing Information and Research Repository (SIR).

## Sentencing Information and Research Repository (SIR)

110    The Sentencing Information and Research Repository for the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) provides as follows:

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image9.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image10.png)

![]([2020] SGDC 0089_Image/[2020] SGDC 0089_image11.png)

111    To be clear, I was mindful that the SIR was less relevant for the present case because of the Escalation principle (analysed at \[22\] to \[30\] above).[^120]

## CONCLUSION

## Summary

112    A summary of my Grounds of Decision is as follows:

> (a)      First Stage: The Accused qualified for the CT regime (at \[15\]).

> (b)      Second Stage:

>> (i)       The likely imprisonment sentence is about 33 months (at \[16\] to \[56\], and \[73\]-\[91\]).

>> (ii)       The Accused would be placed on the MAS (at \[57\] to \[62\]).

>> (iii)       A sentence of CT would be unduly disproportionate (at \[63\] to \[72\]).

113    All things considered, the Accused was imprisoned for 33 months and 72 days. He is currently serving his sentence.

114    No appeal has been lodged.

115    I appreciate the considerable assistance rendered by the Prosecution and the Defence. In particular, I am grateful for DPP Amanda Sum’s conscientiousness.

**_Annex A: Statement of Facts_**

**PUBLIC PROSECUTOR**

**v**

**IBRAHIM BIN BAJURI**

**DAC 933843/2019**

**DAC 933844/2019**

**DAC 917969/2019**

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

**Introduction**

1.     The accused is Ibrahim Bin Bajuri, a 56-year-old male Singaporean. He is an ex-resident of New Hope Community Service located at 207H Ponggol Seventeenth Avenue, Singapore. The accused was unemployed at the material time of the offences.

2.     From **1 March 2019 to 29 June 2019**, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 or 3 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, Rev Ed 2014) (the “**Remission Order**”), which remission order is subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the Prisons Act.

II.     **Facts pertaining to the 1st Charge (DAC 933843 of 2019) – s 379 Penal Code**

A.      **_Parties_**

3.     The first victim-cum-complainant is Gurbaj Singh, a 29-year-old male Singaporean. He was working as a delivery driver at the material time.

B.      **_First Information Report_**

4.     On 25 April 2019, at about 11.19 a.m., the first victim called ‘999’ stating “_I parked my lorry YB8102G here about 5 mins ago, upon my returned, I discovered my handphone is missing_”. The incident location given was along Geylang Road Lorong 8, Singapore (the “**first incident location**”).

**C.** **_Investigations_**

5.     Investigations revealed that on 25 April 2019 at about 11.00 a.m., the first victim drove a lorry bearing licence plate number YB 8102G (the “**lorry**”) to a location at or about Lorong 8 Geylang to make a delivery to a nearby minimart.

6.     Upon his arrival at the minimart, the first victim stopped his vehicle and alighted with his colleague. The first victim left his Samsung J8 handphone (valued at $180) (the “**Samsung handphone**”) inside the lorry near the driver’s seat, and did not lock the lorry’s doors. The first victim stood nearby outside the lorry with two delivery trolleys, while his colleague performed the delivery.

7.     At or about 11.10 a.m. the same day, the accused walked past the lorry. The accused opened the door on the driver’s side of the lorry, and saw the first victim’s Samsung handphone near the driver’s seat. The accused formed the dishonest intent to commit theft of the Samsung handphone. The accused stretched his hand into the said lorry and retrieved the Samsung handphone from the lorry. The accused then left the scene.

8.     POLCAM footage showed the accused approaching the driver side door of the first victim’s lorry at about 11.10 a.m. on 25 April 2019, and thereafter, opening the said door and reaching into the lorry’s cabin from the driver’s door. Thereafter, the accused was seen walking away from the lorry with the Samsung handphone in his right hand within the same footage. The said Samsung handphone was not recovered, and the accused had not made restitution to the victim to date.

9.     By taking the Samsung handphone out of the possession of the first victim with the intent to commit theft of the said handphone, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

10.    Further, the accused had committed this offence on 25 April 2019 while the Remission Order was in effect. The accused shall therefore be deemed upon his conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(_b_) of the Prisons Act to have breached the basic condition of the Remission Order, and is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(_a_) read with section 50T(2)(_b_) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **66 days** from **25 April 2019 to 29 June 2019** for the offence in the 1st charge.

III.        **Facts pertaining to the 3rd Charge (DAC 933844 of 2019) – s 323 Penal Code**

A.      **_Parties_**

11.    The second victim is Sharil Bin Hassan, a 44-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, the second victim was employed as an Assistant Manager at a restaurant in Clementi Mall. Both the accused and victim were friends who usually met at a coffeeshop along Lorong 20 Geylang, Singapore.

12.    The witness is Nuraslina Binte Mistam, a 28-year-old female Singaporean.

B.      **_First Information Report_**

13.    On 26 April 2019, at about 5.23 a.m., the witness called ‘999’ stating “_a man was beaten up and he is bleeding_”. The incident location given was along Geylang Road Lorong 8, Singapore (the “**second incident location**”).

C.      **_Investigations_**

14.    Investigations revealed that sometime on 26 April 2019 at or about 5.00 a.m., the second victim took a taxi to a coffeeshop at the junction of Lorong 20 Geylang and Geylang Road for breakfast. As the second victim was eating his breakfast, the accused approached the second victim and attempted to make conversation with him. The accused faced difficulty standing, and appeared to be ‘high’ while he spoke with the witness.

15.    The second victim quickly finished his breakfast, and walked towards Lorong 18 Geylang, Singapore. At 5.20 a.m. on the same day, the second victim then sat on a bench in front of a barber shop of No. 340 Geylang Road, #01-04, Singapore. Without warning, the accused approached the second victim from behind, and swung an empty glass beer bottle at the back of victim’s head with his right arm with intent to cause hurt to the second victim. The glass beer bottle shattered on impact with the second victim’s head. The accused then threw the broken glass bottle away, and left the scene.

16.    Investigations further revealed that there was no commotion or dispute between the second victim and the accused prior to the assault.

17.    The second victim was subsequently conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) by ambulance. On 8 May 2019, Dr Sim Guan Chua, a medical officer of TTSH, prepared a medical report stating that the second victim suffered the following injuries as a result of the accused’s assault:

> a.     A 1-cm superficial laceration over the top of his head;

> b.     Small cephalohaematoma over the left posterior parietal area, left temporal area that is mildly tender;

> c.     A 1-cm superficial laceration over the left posterior parental area; and

> d.     A 1-cm superficial laceration over the left posterior inferior occipital area.

18     By voluntarily causing hurt to the second victim by means of hitting him in the back of his head with an empty beer bottle, which resulted in the second victim sustaining the injuries set out in \[17\], the accused has committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code.

19     Further, the accused had committed this offence on 26 April 2019 while the Remission Order was in effect. The accused shall therefore be deemed upon his conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(_b_) of the Prisons Act to have breached the basic condition of the Remission Order, and is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(_a_) read with section 50T(2)(_b_) of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **65 days** from **26 April 2019 to 29 June 2019** for the said offence.

20.    The accused committed the offences in the 1st and 3rd charges while under investigations for the offence relating to the 4th charge (see below).

## IV.   Facts pertaining to the 4th Charge (DAC 917969 of 2019) – s 380 Penal Code

A.      **_Parties_**

21.    The complainant in respect of the 4th charge is James Boyd Weight Bwan, a 71-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, the complainant was working as a caretaker at the halfway house, New Hope Community Service (“NHCS”) located at the address in \[23\].

22.    The third victim is Zulkiflee Bin Yaakob, a 51-year-old male Singaporean.

B.      **_First Information Report_**

23.    Investigations revealed that on 19 April 2019 at about 1.12 p.m., the complainant called '999' and reported, “_We are halfway house. One of the ex-occupant, he was removed by the police. Now he come back and is being disorderly_”. The incident location given was NHCS located at 207H Ponggol Seventeenth Avenue, Singapore (the “**halfway house**”). The halfway house was a building used for human dwelling.

24.    On the same day at about 10.34 p.m., the third victim called ‘999’ and reported, “_I came back here and see my place got ransacked and my things are lost – my pouch, my spectacles all lost. I reported to caretaker here who see camera and saw someone there. Witness who stay here also, say Ibrahim came while high on drugs and did these but I don’t know who is he.”_ The incident location provided was the halfway house.

C.      **_Investigations_**

25.    Investigations revealed that on 19 April 2019 at about 1.30 p.m., the complainant was informed by other halfway house inmates that the accused was sitting at the dining area of the halfway house. The complainant told the accused to leave the premises. The accused refused to do so, and challenged the complainant to call the police. As such, the complainant called for police assistance. While waiting for police officers to arrive, the accused stood outside the halfway house premises with two bags, and continued taunting the complainant. The accused appeared ‘high’ while within the premises of the halfway house.

26.    Investigations revealed that on 19 April 2019 at about 1.10 p.m., the accused person arrived at the halfway house and entered the premises. The accused sat at the outdoor dining area after entering the said halfway house.

27.    At about 1.16 p.m. the same day, the accused entered through the front door of the halfway house, and climbed a stairwell to a higher floor. At about 1.17 p.m., the accused entered the room of the third victim, and formed the dishonest intent to commit theft of the items therein. The accused then removed one spectacle box containing a pair of spectacles of unknown value and one Quran of unknown value from the third victim’s possession without his consent, with the dishonest intent to commit theft of these items.

28.    The accused then placed the stolen items in \[27\] into his haversack and shopping bag, and returned to the dining area of the halfway house on the ground floor. The accused subsequently left the halfway house after the complainant told him to leave, and after he taunted the complainant.

29.    Further investigations revealed that the accused previously resided in the same room as the third victim when he was a resident at the halfway house. Closed-circuit television footage also recorded the accused entering the victims’ room and removing the said items in \[27\].

30.    To date, the stolen items in \[27\] have not been recovered, and no restitution has been made by the accused.

31.    By removing the items in \[27\] from the halfway house, a building used for human dwelling, with the dishonest intention of taking the said items out of the third victim’s possession without his consent, the accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 380 of the Penal Code.

32.    Further, the accused had committed this offence on 19 April 2019 while the Remission Order was in effect. The accused shall therefore be deemed upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(_b_) of the Prisons Act to have breached the basic condition of the Remission Order, and is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(_a_) read with section 50T(2)(_b_**)** of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of **72 days** from **19 April 2019 to 29 June 2019** for the said offence.

V.      **Conclusion**

33.    The accused admits to the above three offences and stands charged accordingly.

[^20]: The Defence wanted only two of the custodial sentences (i.e. 917969-2019 and 933844-2019) to run consecutively. NE, 6 April 2020, 29/21-30/7.

[^24]: See also the five-step sentencing framework in _Logachev Vladislav v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> at \[71\]-\[84\], which is broadly similar to the 2-step sentencing bands framework in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGCA 37</span> at \[73(a), (c) and (d)\].

[^25]: Judge-made sentencing frameworks for a variety of statutory offences take the common form of a harm-culpability matrix which embeds in a fundamental way retributive thinking in the sentencing exercise: _Public Prosecutor v ASR_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 16</span> at \[131\].

[^26]: The factors relating to harm and culpability often affect both considerations: _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> at \[79\]. A sentencing court should be mindful not to double count the offence-specific factors in its sentencing assessment: _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 221</span> at \[58\].

[^28]: The sentencing guidelines for the trafficking of diamorphine are found in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 197</span> at \[47\].

[^31]: “\[T\]here will be exceptional cases where the _harm_ caused by the offence can also be used to determine both the applicable category and where the particular case falls within the applicable presumptive sentencing range. One example of this would be where more than one death is caused, as in the present case”: _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[56\].

[^32]: This case dealt with the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant (police officers and public servants who are performing duties akin to police duties at the material time) under s 332 of the Penal Code.

[^33]: The offender had caused a fatal accident by a rash act under s 304A(a) of the Penal Code.

[^34]: The two principal parameters which a sentencing court would generally have regard to in evaluating the seriousness of a crime are: (a) the harm caused by the offence, and (b) the offender’s culpability. _Lim Ying Luciana v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1220</span> at \[28\], _Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 269</span> at \[19\], _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 123</span> at \[41\], and _Public Prosecutor v Ganesan Sivasankar_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 176</span> at \[33\] and \[53\]-\[56\].
