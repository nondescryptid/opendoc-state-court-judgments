### District Judge Kow Keng Siong:

## Introduction

1       Sukla Lalatendu (“**the Accused**”) was charged with the following offences:

> (a)      **MCN-901798-2021.** An offence under reg 3A(1)(a) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 (“**COVID Regulations**”) and punishable under s 34(7)(a) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 (No. 14 of 2020) (“**COVID Act**”) for having, without reasonable excuse, failed to wear a mask over his nose and mouth when he was outside his ordinary place of residence. This offence was allegedly committed on 15 August 2021 at or about 10.45 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. in the vicinity of Block 159 Bedok South Avenue 3 **(“COVID Charge”)**.

> (b)      **MCN-901797-2021.** An offence under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.) (“**the Penal Code**”) for having kicked one Muzaffar Alihussen Dohadwala (“**the Victim**”) at his right lower rib region thus causing the Victim to suffer bodily pain. This offence was allegedly committed on the same day as the COVID Charge at or about 11.00 a.m. next to the ground floor lift landing (Lift A) located at Block 159 Bedok South Avenue 3 **(“Hurt Charge”)**.

2       The Accused disputed his charges. After a trial, I convicted him and imposed the following sentences:

> (a)      **COVID Charge.** $2,000, and in default, 10 days’ imprisonment.

> (b)      **Hurt Charge.** $5,000, and in default, 25 days’ imprisonment.

3       The Accused has appealed against his conviction and sentences. Before explaining the reasons for my decision, I will set out the relevant facts.

## Facts relating to the COVID Charge

### Undisputed facts

4       At the time of the offences, the Accused and the Victim were residing at Block 159 Bedok South Avenue 3 (“**Block 159**”). The Accused resided in a unit on the 10th floor (“**Flat Unit**”) while the Victim resided in a unit on the 11th floor.

5       On 15 August 2021 at or about 10.45 a.m., the Victim saw the Accused at the staircase landing between the 10th and 11th floors of Block 159 (“**Staircase Landing**”). The Accused was smoking and was not wearing a mask. The Victim told the Accused to stop smoking at the Staircase Landing because this was not allowed. He also told the Accused to wear a mask as this was a requirement when an individual was outside his house (“**the Confrontation**”). When the Accused refused to comply, the Victim started to record a video of the Accused on his handphone: “**Handphone Recording (Part 1)**”. The Handphone Recording (Part 1) was admitted as evidence at the trial (**P6**).

6       The Handphone Recording (Part 1) shows the following:

> (a)     The Accused walked down the Staircase Landing, went past the 10th floor corridor (where the Flat Unit was located) and stopped at the 9th floor to wait for a lift.

> (b)     When the lift door opened, the Accused entered the lift and pressed the lift button. (It was the Accused’s evidence that he had intended to proceed to the ground floor.)

> (c)     When the Victim pressed the lift button to prevent the lift from moving, the Accused exited the lift and proceeded to the ground floor using the staircase.

> (d)     After reaching the foot of Block 159, the Accused smoked a cigarette.

> (e)     Throughout the entire period, the Accused _can clearly be seen without a mask_.

### The Accused’s case

7       The Accused did not dispute that he was not wearing a mask at all material times. The Accused however claimed that he had a reasonable excuse for not doing so. According to him, the Victim was very hostile towards him and had used vulgarities against him. The Accused had wanted to return to the Flat Unit – but could not do so because the Victim had “_totally_ blocked” his path.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) Left without a choice, the Accused went to the foot of Block 159 to avoid a situation.

## Facts relating to the Hurt Charge

### Undisputed facts

8       After he had finished smoking his cigarette, the Accused proceeded to the ground floor lift landing (Lift B) of Block 159.

9       While waiting for the lift, the Accused had an argument with the Victim. When the Accused entered the lift, the Victim pressed the lift button to stop the door from closing and then walked away. The Accused exited the lift and walked towards the carpark near Lift A of Block 159. The Victim followed the Accused. These events were recorded by police cameras at the ground floor lift landing of Lift A (**P7**) and Lift B (**P8**).

### Prosecution’s case

10     While at the vicinity of the carpark near Lift A, the Victim started to record a video of the Accused on his handphone again: (**P6**) – **Handphone Recording (Part 2)**. During the recording, the Accused suddenly charged towards the Victim on two occasions. On the first occasion, the Accused punched the Victim.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) On the second occasion, the Accused caused the Victim to fall and thereafter kicked him twice at his right lower rib region. To block the kicks, the Victim raised his knee and placed his hands around his chest and face.[^3] The Accused stopped assaulting the Victim when one Willy Baymon Wong L P Jr (“**Wong**”) – a passer-by – intervened.

11     After the assault had stopped, the Victim called the police. After the police arrived at the scene, the Victim was conveyed by ambulance to Changi General Hospital (“**CGH**”). At CGH, Dr Patrick Kong Man Ching (“**Dr Kong**”) examined the Victim and documented the following injuries in the medical records:

> (a)     Mild tenderness over the Victim’s right lower rib region.

> (b)     Mild right-sided back pain at level of the Victim’s L4 and L5.

> (c)     Mild tenderness over the Victim’s left distal ulna region.

> (d)     Mild abrasion at the Victim’s right elbow.

> (e)     Small abrasion over the Victim’s left 4th finger distal interphalangeal joint.

> (f)     Mild soft tissue swelling in the Victim’s left wrist.

12     A medical report on the Victim’s injuries was tendered in evidence (**P2**).

### The Accused’s case

13     The Accused denied having assaulted the Victim. According to the Accused, all he did was to swipe the handphone away from the Victim’s hand. In response, the Victim tried to kick the Accused in the groin twice. On each occasion, the Victim ended up falling into a drain (on his own).

## Key issues for determination

14     The key factual issues for determination in this case are as follows:

> (a)     For the COVID Charge: Did the Victim block the Accused from returning to the Flat Unit?

> (b)     For the Hurt Charge: Did the Accused kick the Victim at the latter’s right lower rib region?

## My decision

### Reasons for conviction on the COVID Charge

#### The Accused’s claim of how the Victim had blocked his path

15     The Accused claimed that the Victim had “totally blocked” him from returning to the Flat Unit in the following manner:[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (a)     After the Confrontation, the Accused started to walk down the Staircase Landing towards the Flat Unit. As he was doing so, the victim quickly ran past him and reached the 10th floor corridor first.

> (b)     At the 10th floor corridor, the Victim stood in front of the Accused with his hands at his waist. Due to space constraint at the corridor, the Accused could not walk past the Victim without “touching” or “pushing” him.

> (c)     In the circumstances, the Accused decided to enter the lift _at the 10th floor_ so as to proceed to the foot of the block instead. However, the lift could not move because the Victim kept pressing the lift button.

> (d)     Feeling “helpless”, the Accused exited the lift and went back to the Staircase Landing.

> (e)     The Accused eventually decided to walk down the staircase to the _9th floor_ to take the lift. When the Victim again pressed the lift button to prevent the lift from moving (just as he had done at the 10th floor), the Accused proceeded to the foot of Block 159 via the staircase.

16     I disbelieve the Accused’s claim.

#### The Accused’s claim is contradicted by the Handphone Recording (Part 1)

17     First, the Accused’s claim is contradicted by the Handphone Recording (Part 1):

> (a)     The recording shows that the Victim did not block the Accused’s path. The Victim can be seen to be _a few metres behind_ the Accused at all material times – save at the 9th floor (i) when he was standing beside the Accused while the latter was waiting for the lift, and (ii) when he was standing about 1 m away from the Accused while pressing the lift button to prevent the Accused’s lift from moving.

> (b)     Furthermore, the Accused’s claim that there was insufficient space for him to walk around the Victim is not supported by the Handphone Recording (Part 1). It is clear from the recording that the 10th floor corridor is spacious.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) Even if the Victim had stood at the corridor with both hands at his waist, there would still be sufficient space for the Accused to walk around him.

> (c)     Finally, from the Handphone Recording (Part 1), it is also clear that the Accused could have returned to the Flat Unit if he had wanted to. For instance:

>> (i)       After being confronted at the Staircase Landing, the Accused had walked down the staircase to the 10th floor corridor. At this point, the Accused could have simply turned left and proceed to the Flat Unit. (In the video recording, the Flat Unit is the first unit on the left of the corridor.)[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) He did not do so. Instead, the Accused continued to walk down the staircase to the 9th floor with the intention of taking the lift to the ground floor.[^7]

>> (ii)       At the 9th floor, after the Victim had pressed the lift button to prevent the lift from moving, the Accused exited the lift. At the point, he could again have proceeded to the Flat Unit (which is just one floor above). He did not. Instead, the Accused walked down the staircase to the ground floor.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

> During the trial, the Accused admitted that he had “all the chances to run away to home” while at the Staircase Landing.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) However, he did not see any reason why he should do so.[^10]

#### The Accused’s claim that the Handphone Recording had been edited

18     The Handphone Recording (Part 1) is fatal to the Accused’s claim that the Victim had “totally blocked” him from returning to the Flat Unit. To overcome this damaging piece of evidence, the Accused contended that the Victim had deleted the footage supporting his claim from the recording.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

19     I am unable to accept the Accused’s contention.

> (a)     The Handphone Recording (Part 1) is a _continuous_ recording. This recording began with the Accused being confronted at the Staircase Landing and ended with him reaching the foot of Block 159. There is no evidence that any of the continuous sequence of events shown in the recording had been tampered with. The Accused did not dispute this.

> (b)     Apart from making a bare allegation that the Handphone Recording (Part 1) had been “edited”, the Accused did not adduce any evidence as to how and in what manner the recording had been edited so as to give a false representation of the events.

> (c)     Neither did the Accused give a clear picture of how the events in the Handphone Recording (Part 1) would fit within his narrative at \[15(a)\] – \[15(d)\] above.

> (d)     For the Accused’s narrative to cohere with the Handphone Recording (Part 1), after the events at \[15(a)\] – \[15(d)\] above, the Victim would have to _climb the staircase from the 10th floor corridor to the 11th floor_ and then start the recording from there while the Accused was standing _below_ him at the Staircase Landing. This simply does not make sense – especially since by doing so, the Victim would have given the Accused an opportunity to run away either to the Flat Unit or down the staircase. I note that the Accused had the wisdom not to maintain that this was what the Victim had done.

#### The Victim’s actions did not prevent the Accused from returning to the Flat Unit

20     During the trial, the Accused had also relied on the following actions by the Victim to explain why he did not return to the Flat Unit:

> (a)     First, the Victim had pressed the lift button at the 9th floor to prevent the Accused (who was then in the lift) from proceeding _to the ground floor_.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> (b)     Second, the Victim had also told the Accused to _“hang on”_[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) as the latter was walking down the staircase_._[^14]

21     In my view, these actions by the Victim – to stop the Accused from proceeding _to the ground floor_ – did not in any way prevent the Accused from returning to the _Flat Unit which is on the 10th floor_.

22     I wish to add that while the Victim had told the Accused that his work permit would get cancelled and had asked him “to come back here” and if he “got no balls”,[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15) there is nothing from the Victim’s tone or words to suggest that he would resort to violence if the Accused were to return to the Flat Unit.

#### The Accused did not intend to return to the Flat Unit

23     In my judgement, what probably had happened is that the Accused did not intend to return to the Flat Unit at the material time. After being told that he could not smoke at the Staircase Landing, the Accused had decided to smoke at the foot of Block 159 instead. This finding is supported by the fact that soon after reaching the foot of Block 159, the Accused began to smoke a cigarette.

### Reasons for conviction on the Hurt Charge

24     I now come to my reasons for convicting the Accused on the Hurt Charge.

#### The Victim is an honest witness whose evidence has been corroborated

25     In essence, I preferred the Victim’s evidence over that of the Accused. The Victim struck me as an honest witness. He had testified in a matter-of-fact manner and did not seek to embellish his evidence against the Accused. The Victim’s evidence that the Accused had assaulted him is internally consistent, credible and reliable.

26     The Victim’s evidence has also been corroborated by independent and objective evidence:

> (a)     In the Handphone Recording (Part 2), the Accused can be seen aggressively and angrily rushing towards the Victim on two occasions. After each occasion, this was immediately followed by violent/jerky motion in the recording.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

> (b)     On the first occasion, the following could be heard after the violent/jerky motion had ended:

> 
| 

Victim:

 | 

You hit me.[^17]

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

Yeah, yeah, come.[^18]

 |
| 

Victim:

 | 

You hit me.[^19]

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

\[… words unclear…\] You want to go viral, is it?[^20]

 |

  
  

> It is the Victim’s evidence that the Accused had assaulted him during the periods when the recordings show violent/jerky motion. In my judgement, the above images and words recorded in the Handphone Recording (Part 2) is consistent with this evidence.

> (c)     The Victim’s evidence is also corroborated by Wong:

>> (i)       Wong testified that he had seen the Accused assault the victim. According to Wong, the Victim had laid on the ground in a “foetal position”[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) and the Accused had kicked the Victim at least twice.[^22] One of the kicks had landed on the Victim’s right hip. Wong’s account is consistent with the Victim’s evidence that the Accused had kicked him at his right lower rib region.

>> (ii)       Wong had also heard the Accused telling the Victim to shove his phone up his ass.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) This piece of evidence shows that the Accused had assaulted the Victim because he was angry with the latter for having made a video recording of him.

> (d)     The Victim’s evidence that the Accused had assaulted him is also supported by medical evidence. According to Dr Kong, the mild tenderness over the Victim’s right lower rib region was likely to have been caused by kicks, while the rest of the Victim’s injuries were possibly caused by a fall.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

#### The Accused’s claims against the Prosecution’s evidence defies logic

27     The Accused was not able to explain away the above incriminating evidence. His response to such overwhelming evidence against him was to make unsubstantiated and outlandish claims. These claims included the following:[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

> (a)     That the Victim had made false allegations of assault because he was unhappy that the police officers at the scene initially did not intend to arrest the Accused.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> (b)     That the Victim had “edited” the Handphone Recording (Part 2) as evidenced by the fact that it did not record the assault.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

>> (i)       In my view, an innocent explanation as to why the recording does not show the assault can be that at the material time, the Victim did not point the camera at the Accused or had dropped the handphone because he was trying to protect himself.

>> (ii)       It also bears noting that the Accused did not specify how the allegedly deleted recording could have undermined the Victim’s case or supported the Accused’s case.

> (c)     That the prosecutor had “protected” and helped the Victim to incriminate the Accused because the Accused is a foreigner and the prosecutor is a xenophobe, “extremist” and “radicalised”.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28)

> (d)     That Wong had committed perjury so that the Accused could be convicted of assault.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29)

>> This is clearly an absurd claim.

>> (i)       The Accused did not provide any reason why Wong would be motivated to falsely incriminate him.

>> (ii)       In my judgement, Wong is an independent and credible witness. At all material times, he was a complete stranger to both the Accused and the Victim. On the day in question, Wong had courageously stepped forward to stop the Accused from assaulting the Victim. Wong did not gain any benefit – either by stopping the assault or testifying against the Accused in court.

>> (iii)       The Accused made much of the fact that Wong had wrongly estimated the distance as to the first time he first saw the assault. According to Wong, the distance is not more than 10 m[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) when it is in fact 34 m.[^31] Honest witnesses can make honest mistakes. I am of the view that at a distance of 34 m, it is still possible for Wong to be able to distinguish who was the aggressor/victim. It is also possible for Wong to see clearly how the Accused had assaulted the Victim – given that his view of the assault was not obstructed and done in broad daylight.

#### The Accused’s evidence is inconsistent and incredible

28     In contrast to the coherence and consistency of the Victim’s evidence, I find the Accused’s case of how the Victim had come to be injured to be unbelievable.

> (a)     Incredibly, the Accused claimed that the Victim was injured because one of the latter’s legs had fallen into a drain – not once, but _twice_.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

> (b)     The Accused had also claimed that apart from swiping the Victim’s hand to stop the latter from recording him on the handphone, he did not touch the Victim.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) If this is correct, then one would not expect to find any injury on the Accused. However, it is _the Accused’s own case_ that he had suffered scratch marks _on his right forearm and thumb_ during the incident.[^34]

29     According to the Accused, his injuries were caused by the Victim kicking him.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) I find this to be an extraordinary claim. The Accused is 1.88 m tall[^36] while the Victim is 1.76 m tall.[^37] It is inconceivable that the Victim (who is shorter than the Accused by more than 20 cm) could have injured the Accused’s forearm and thumb in the manner described by the Accused.

#### Reason why the Accused had assaulted the Victim

30     It is evident from the Accused’s own case that he was angry with the Victim at the material time. He was angry because the Victim (a) had commented that he had “no balls” (while at the Staircase Landing), (b) had repeatedly “harassed” the Accused by pointing his handphone camera at him to make a recording throughout the entire episode, and (c) had caused him to be late for a meeting.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38) It is clear to me that this anger had driven the Accused to assault the Victim.

### Sentencing

31     Having explained my decision to convict the Accused on his charges, I will now explain my sentencing decisions.

#### Prescribed punishments and sentencing positions

32     The prescribed punishments for the Accused’s offences and the Prosecution’s sentencing positions are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.7%"><col width="48.5%"><col width="34.8%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Prescribed punishment</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Prosecution’s sentencing position</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">COVID Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2,000</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Hurt Charge</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Imprisonment for a term which may extend 3 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$5,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

33     The Accused declined to enter a mitigation plea.

#### Sentencing considerations for COVID Charge

34     In imposing a fine of $2,000 for the COVID Charge, I had considered the following:

> (a)     According to data in the Sentencing Information and Research Repository, courts have typically imposed fines for contraventions of reg 3A(1)(a) of the COVID Regulations read with s 34(7)(a) of the COVID Act. The usual tariff is a fine of between $2,000 to $3,000.

> (b)     There is nothing particularly aggravating or mitigating in the Accused’s offence. The duration when he did not wear a mask is relatively short – about 15 minutes. During this period, it appears from the video evidence that apart from the Victim and Wong, the Accused did not come into close contact with other persons. In other words, the risk of the Accused infecting other persons with COVID t the material time – by not wearing a mask – is low.

#### Sentencing considerations for Hurt Charge

35     As for the Hurt Charge, I am guided by the sentencing framework laid down in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“**_Low Song Chye_**”). Under this framework, the severity of a s 323 offence is pegged to the extent of _physical hurt_ caused to the victim. There are three bands/levels of severity for the offence. These bands and their corresponding sentencing ranges are as follows: at \[77\].

36     In _Low Song Chye_, the High Court held that –

> 78    \[…\] In sentencing an offender under s 323 of the Penal Code, the court is to undertake the following _two-step inquiry_:

>> (a)    First, the court should identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused by the offence. This would allow the court to derive the appropriate indicative starting point. **(First Step)**

>> (b)    Next, the court should make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors. _This may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range._ The aggravating and mitigating factors identified in _BDB_ at \[62\] to \[70\] and \[71\] to \[75\] respectively are relevant at this step. **(Second Step)**

> \[italics and text in bold added\]

37     Regarding the Second Step, the aggravating and mitigating factors are as follows:

> **Aggravating factors**

> (a)     The extent of deliberation or premeditation

> (b)     The manner and duration of the attack

> (c)     The victim’s vulnerability

> (d)     The use of any weapon

> (e)     Whether the attack was undertaken by a group

> (f)     Any relevant antecedents on the offender’s part

38     When _Low Song Chye_ was decided, the prescribed punishment for s 323 was imprisonment for a term which may extend to _2 years_, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both. With effect from 1 January 2020, the maximum term of imprisonment was enhanced to _3 years_. In my view, this enhancement of the prescribed punishment would not be material in sentencing the Accused. This is because I agree with the Prosecution that the appropriate sentence is a fine under Band 1 of the framework. The Victim had suffered only minor injuries arising from the assault – mild tenderness, pain, abrasions and soft tissue swelling: see \[11\] above.

39     In imposing a fine of $5,000, I had considered the following:

> **_Aggravating factors_**

> (a)     The Accused had assaulted the Victim in a public place in broad daylight. Apart from Wong, there are other members of the public who had witnessed the assault.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) Violent conduct committed in public view is an aggravating factor because it can cause fear and alarm, or public disquiet.

> (b)     The Accused had violence-related antecedents. In 2009, he was convicted of criminal intimidation and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. Another charge of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour within the hearing and sight of a person was taken into consideration for sentencing. The Accused was fined a total of $1,800. While relevant, I did not give these antecedents much weight in sentencing given that they are more than a decade old.

> (c)     The Accused was not remorseful for his offence and had in fact conducted his defence in an egregious manner: see \[40\] – \[44\] below.

> **_Mitigating factors_**

> (d)     The Victim had pointed his handphone camera at the Accused to record the latter’s actions for a total period of almost four minutes.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) The Victim had also told the Accused that his work permit would get cancelled, “to come back here”, and asked if he “got no balls”. Although the Victim’s provocative and offensive behaviour neither justifies nor excuses the Accused in assaulting the Victim, the Accused’s unhappiness with the Victim is understandable.

> (e)     From the Handphone Recording (Parts 1 and 2), it is clear that the Accused had tried his best not to engage with the Victim. After being confronted at the Staircase Landing, he walked away to the 9th floor to take the lift. When the Victim pressed the lift button to stop the lift from moving, the Accused again calmly exited the lift and proceeded to the foot of Block 159 via the staircase.

#### The Accused conducted defence in an egregious manner

40     In deciding on the appropriate sentences, I cannot ignore the fact that the Accused had made many serious and baseless allegations against the prosecutor and the investigations officer (“**IO**”). For instance, he had accused them of[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) –

> (a)     Having knowingly offered false and “inadmissible” evidence,

> (b)     Having hidden exculpatory evidence,

> (c)     Having encouraged witnesses to commit perjury,

> (d)     Having committed “prosecutorial bluffing” and misled the court,

> (e)     Having breached the “code of conduct”,

> (f)     Having abused prosecutorial powers, and

> (g)     Being “radicalised”.

41     The Accused had even called for criminal proceedings to be commenced against the prosecutor and the IO for alleged professional misconduct, dishonesty and incompetence.

42     Serious allegations require strong evidence. The Accused had not raised any evidence to substantiate his malicious allegations.

43     The Accused had also chosen to persist in bad behaviour during the trial, despite many reminders to desist from such actions. The Accused’s bad behaviour included taking down his mask in court and throwing it in the direction of the Victim,[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) suggesting that the Victim and Wong were drug addicts,[^43] calling the prosecutor “stupid”, and ridiculing the prosecutor (such as commenting that the prosecutor had ironically contracted COVID while he did not). The Accused was also prone to antics such as becoming hysterical and crying in court (this occurred on more than one occasion) in order to persuade me the merits of his defence.

44     Clearly, the Accused had conducted his defence in an egregious manner. He had unnecessarily prolonged the trial, woven a fanciful defence and displayed bad behaviour during the trial. Such conduct deserves to be treated as an aggravating factor: _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2019) at \[20.214\] – \[20.240\].

#### Professional conduct by prosecutor and the IO

45     For the record, I wish to state that despite being the subject of repeated abusive treatment by the Accused, the Prosecution had adopted reasonable and measured sentencing positions regarding the Accused’s offences. This speaks well of the fairness and professionalism in which the prosecution has been conducted.

## Conclusion

46     Before concluding, I would like to briefly address an issue that had been a bug bear for the Accused – namely that there had been alleged delays in the disposal of his case.

47     In my view, there has been no such delay. The offences were committed on 15 August 2021. He was charged in court less than three months later (on 12 November 2021). Trial commenced about five months thereafter. Verdict was entered on 25 August 2022. In other words, the Accused’s case was disposed off about a year after the commission of the offences.

48     The Accused’s trial took five days. If there was any delay in the completion of the trial, responsibility for this rested on the Accused. For instance, substantial trial time was taken up because the Accused –

> (a)     had repeatedly interrupted witnesses when they testified,

> (b)     had repeatedly refused to give a clear and coherent account of what his defence was, and

> (c)     had repeatedly given rambling and irrelevant answers, raised irrelevant issues, posed rhetorical questions, and remained silent at times during his cross-examination.

49     Given that the Accused was unrepresented, I had given him some leeway during the trial and provided him relevant information so that he can better navigate the trial process, properly understand the issues at hand, and effectively conduct his defence. Despite such information having been provided, the Accused had chosen to needlessly prolong the trial.
