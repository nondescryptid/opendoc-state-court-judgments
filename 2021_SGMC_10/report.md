Criminal Procedure And Sentencing – Sentencing – Insulting modesty of a woman – Penal Code Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed

\[LawNet Editorial Note: The appeal in MA 9035/2021/01 was withdrawn on 22 March 2021.\]

8 March 2021

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

## Introduction

1       The Accused who had a predilection for committing acts of voyeurism against girls attending junior college pleaded guilty to a single charge under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) read with section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”). I sentenced the Accused to six months’ imprisonment. The Accused being dissatisfied with the sentence has appealed.

2       The Accused is currently serving his sentence having surrendered to commence the sentence on 19 February 2021. At the sentencing mention on 29 January 2021, the Accused had sought for a deferment of the sentence until 19 February 2021. On 9 February 2021, the Accused filed a Petition of Appeal against the sentence imposed. The Court had contacted the Defence and sought confirmation on whether the Accused intended to apply for bail pending the hearing of the appeal. The Defence confirmed that the Accused did not intend to apply for bail and intended to surrender to commence his sentence on 19 February 2021.

## Charges

3       The details of the charge are as follows:

>      **MCN 900745 of 2020**

>     You, Ng Chee Kai, Daren, are charged that you, between 9 January 2019 and 1 October 2019, did intrude upon the privacy of multiple women with intent to insult the modesty of the said multiple women, _to wit_, by using your mobile phone to capture 109 upskirt and downblouse videos of the unidentified women at various locations in Singapore, which amounts to 109 separate incidents of the commission of the offence under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) which taken together amount to a course of conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 509of the said Code, which charge is amalgamated pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

## Facts

4       The Accused is Ng Chee Kai, Daren, a 24-year old male Singaporean. He was a regular serviceman in the Singapore Navy at the time of the commission of the offences. On 25 October 2019, one \[**Redacted**\] (“Ms G”), lodged a police report informing that she had been followed by an unknown make subject on 16 October 2019 when she was at Buona Vista MRT Station. One of the charges that was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (MCN 900747 of 2020) related to an offence under section 509 committed by the Accused against Ms G.

5       As a result, the Accused was arrested, and investigations were commenced. The Accused admitted to taking an upskirt video of Ms G and that he had deleted the video that he took immediately after. The Accused also admitted to committing similar acts prior to the incident involving Ms G. The Accused’s mobile phone and computer were seized and, after a forensic examination was conducted on the devices, multiple upskirt and a downblouse video were extracted.

6       The Accused admitted that between 9 January 2019 and 1 October 2019 he had taken 108 upskirt videos and one downblouse video at various locations around Singapore, including MRT stations, overhead bridges near bus-stops and during bus rides. The Accused admitted that he had intended to insult the modesty of the various unidentified victims in the 109 videos.

7       The Accused would target victims wearing skirts on public transport or in the surrounding vicinity of public transport. Many of the victims were students at junior colleges and of the 109 videos in the proceeded charge, 101 videos were of victims wearing school uniforms. The Accused admitted that it was his preference to film junior college girls in school uniform. The Accused also admitted that he targeted victims at locations near to junior colleges.

8       Upon seeing a girl that he found attractive the Accused would form the intention to insult her modesty by recording an upskirt video. He would then approach the victim, stand close to her and angle his phone to take an upskirt or downblouse video. On some occasions, the Accused would follow the victim for a period and film multiple voyeuristic videos. The faces of some of the victims were also captured in the videos.

## Charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC charges”)

9       The Accused admitted to and consented to an additional charge under section 509 of the PC read with section 124(4) of the CPC and one charge under section 509 of the PC being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The charge under section 509 of the PC read with section 124(4) of the CPC involved the Accused recording seven upskirt videos between 23 May 2018 and 24 August 2018.

## Issues to be determined

10     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     The level of planning and premeditation exhibited by the Accused;

> (b)     Whether the victims were vulnerable victims; and

> (c)     The appropriate sentence in view of the facts and circumstances of the case.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

11     Offences under section 509 of the PC read with section 124(4) of the CPC are punishable with a fine or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or with both.

### Antecedents

12     The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

13     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least eight months’ imprisonment.

14     The Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors:

> (a)     There was persistent and habitual offending as evidenced by the fact that the Accused recorded 109 videos over a period of ten months. The Prosecution also highlighted that the Accused had consented to a further two TIC charges;

> (b)     The Accused had demonstrated premeditation and planning in his offending as he had targeted victims that he found attractive, who that were mostly wearing school uniforms and near to junior colleges;

> (c)     The Accused had committed the offences by using a recording device;

> (d)     The Accused committed the offences in the vicinity of public transport areas, he targeted his victims at MRT stations, bus-stations and on public buses; and

> (e)     The Accused targeted young victims that he knew were below the age of 18. The Prosecution, in their oral reply submission, submitted that the age of the victims was also pertinent as the young victims were vulnerable and that the offences would affect the victim’s self-awareness.

### Mitigation

#### Circumstances of the offences.

15     The Accused had started watching pornography at the age of 13 and during this time he had been exposed to pornography involving upskirt videos. He was punished at school when it came to light that he was viewing pornography and, as a result, in lost interest in pornography. In 2018 or 2019, the Accused started to revisit pornography sites and his curiosity with upskirt videos was rekindled. The Accused then started taking the videos himself and he was “_drawn to women wearing Junior College uniforms_”[^1].

#### Defence acceptance of certain aggravating factors.

16     The Defence, to their credit, accepted that the Accused’s offending did disclose aggravating factors. It was conceded that the Accused displayed persistent and habitual offending and that this was an aggravating factor. It was also accepted that the use of recording device and the fact that some of the offences were committed at public transport areas were aggravating factors[^2].

17     However, the Defence submitted that other aggravating factors did not feature in the present case, the Defence disagreed that there was premeditation and planning and that the age of the victims should not be considered a factor in sentencing in the present case.

#### Whether there was premeditation and planning.

18     The Defence referred to the Court of Appeal decision in _Pram Nair v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> where it was noted, a \[138\], that “the kind of premeditation which the law regards as aggravating an offence involves a significant degree of planning and orchestration”. The Defence submitted that in the present case, the Accused’s actions did not display a significant degree of planning and premeditation. It was submitted that the fact that for some of the incidents the Accused followed victims that he found to be attractive did not amount to significant degree of planning and premeditation. In addition, the Defence submitted that, beside using a mobile phone to record the videos, there was no marked increase in the level of sophistication in the commission of the offences.

19     The Defence also referred to _Public Prosecutor v Ryan You Jun Chao_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 42</span> and _Public Prosecutor v BMF_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 227</span>, as examples of cases where it was found that there was planning on the part of the offender. The Defence submitted that in the present case did not involve situations where the Accused had employed sophistication or had planned to commit the offences. The Defence submitted that the Accused was not goal-oriented in his offending, unlike the offender in _Ryan You_.

#### Whether the age of the victims was a relevant consideration.

20     The Defence submitted that the Court should not consider that the age of the victims would lead to a conclusion that the victims were vulnerable victims and that this should be treated as an aggravating factor. The Defence referred to _Rachel Ann Fernandez v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 248</span> where the High Court held, at \[12\], that for age to indicate vulnerability there would have to be an impact on mental faculties, something to indicate an increased dependency on others or a proclivity towards misplacing trust. Further, the Prosecution would have to point out this vulnerability specifically.

21     The Defence submitted that merely highlighting that the some of the victims in the present case were under 18 years old was insufficient to mount a case that the Accused had targeted vulnerable victims. There was no evidence that the Accused had taken advantage of any perceived vulnerabilities in the victims in order to commit the offences, this was especially so as most of the offences were committed under the “cloak of surreptitiousness”.

#### Weight to be given to the TIC charges

22     The Defence submitted that as the Accused’s persistent and habitual offending had already been considered an aggravating factor, no further weight should be given to the TIC charges as this would amount to double counting.

#### Mitigating factors

23     The Defence submitted that the Accused was sorry for his actions and that his plea of guilt and cooperation with the authorities were evidence of his sorrow and his remorse.

24     The Accused had also taken active steps to correct his deviant behaviour as he had been seeking help from Dr Yap Hwa Ling and was attending therapy sessions. Dr Yap opined that the Accused suffered from voyeuristic disorder. In addition, the Accused had stopped taking public transport in order to avoid being put in a position that may result in him giving in to his urges.

25     Considering the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors the Defence sought a sentence of between 14 to 16 weeks’ imprisonment.

### Sentencing precedents

26     The Prosecution and Defence referred to tables of sentencing precedents. I will address some of the sentencing precedents below.

### Decision on Sentence

#### Relevant legislative provisions

27     The relevant legislative provision of the PC is as follows:

> **509**.    Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine or with both.

28     The relevant provisions of the CPC are as follows:

> **124\. –**     (4) Despite subsection (1) and (2) and section 132, where 2 or more incidents of the commission of the same offence by the accused are alleged, and those alleged incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct (having regard to the time, place of purpose of each alleged incident) –

>> (_a_)    it is sufficient to frame one charge for all of those alleged incidents, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

>>> (i)    the charge –

>>>> (A)    contains a statement that the charge is amalgamated under this subsection;

>>>> (B)    either –

>>>>> (BA)   specifies the number of separate incidents of the commission of that offence that are alleged, without specifying each particular alleged incident; or

>>>>> (BB)   if the causing of a particular outcome is an element of that offence, contains details of the aggregate outcome caused by all of those alleged incidents without specifying the particular outcome caused by each particular alleged incident;

>>>> (C)    contains a statement that all of those alleged incidents taken together amount to a course of conduct; and

>>>> (D)    specifies the dates between which all of those incidents are alleged to have occurred, without specifying the exact date for each particular alleged incident.

>>> (ii)   if a separate charge had been framed in respect of each of those incidents, the maximum punishment for the offence specified in each separate charge would be the same maximum punishment;

>>> (iii)   the charge so framed does not specify any offence punishable with death; and

>> (_b_)    the charge so framed is deemed to be a charge of one offence.

> (5)    For the purposes of subsection (4), 2 or more alleged incidents of the commission of an offence, taken together, may amount to a course of conduct, if one or more of the following circumstances exist:

>> (a)    where the offence is one that has an identifiable victim, the victim in each alleged incident is the same person or belongs to the same class of persons;

>> (b)    all of the alleged incidents involve the employment of the same method or similar methods;

>> (c)    all of the alleged incidents occurred in the same place, in similar places, or in places that are located near to each other;

>> (d)    all of the alleged incidents occurred within a defined period that does not exceed 12 months.

#### Effect of a charge amalgamated under section 124(4) of the CPC on the sentence.

29     I found that the requirements to amalgamated the offences under s 124(4) of the CPC were made out.

30     I then considered the effect of an amalgamated charge on the sentence to be imposed. The Prosecution, in the exercise of its discretion, could have chosen to tender a separate charge for each upskirt or downblouse offence committed by the Accused. In such a situation the Accused could possibly have been charged with up to 117 charges under s 509 of the PC. The Prosecution would, in further exercise of its discretion, determine the number of proceeded charges and the number of TIC charges.

31     A perusal of the Prosecution’s sentencing precedents for “_Non-amalgamated charges under s 509 featuring a high number of victims_”[^3] would show that for cases involving a similar number of offences, i.e. between 70 and 130 offences, the Prosecution has proceeded on between 9%[^4] and 40%[^5] of all the charges. It was also apparent that for most of these cases the Courts had directed that at least three sentences were to run consecutively. The sentences for each proceeded charge in these cases ranged between seven weeks’ and nine months’ imprisonment per charge which has resulted in global sentences of between 21 weeks imprisonment[^6] and 36 months’ imprisonment[^7].

32     In the present case, the Prosecution had proceeded on a single amalgamated charge with the remaining two charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The analysis at paragraph 31 is to show that the sentences to be imposed for amalgamated charges should take reference from the global sentences that were imposed for similar cases involving non-amalgamated charges and should not result in a sentencing discount for the Accused.

33     In _Public Prosecutor v Musadiq s/o Abbas_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 254</span>, the offender had pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 420 of the PC read with s 124(4) of the CPC. In sentencing the Accused to a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment[^8] the District Judge held, at \[21\]:

>     I was mindful that in calibrating the sentence for an amalgamated charge, **it should not result in a sentencing discount for the Accused vis-à-vis the overall sentence he would have received had he been prosecuted on multiple charges** in relation to the same offending acts which constituted the course of conduct reflected in the amalgamated charges.

34     I am fully in agreement with the District Judge’s findings. The sentence to be imposed for an amalgamated charge should not take reference to sentencing guideline, and precedents, that might be applicable to single offences.

#### Sentencing considerations for s 509 offences.

35     In _Public Prosecutor v Tay Beng Guan Albert_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 778</span> (_Albert Tay_), the respondent had recorded videos of the victim undressing and using the toilet. Yong CJ held that for s 509 of the PC offences, where the Accused had recorded the victim in her private moments, unlike other “peeping tom cases”, allowed the Accused the potential to view repeatedly the recordings for his own perverted pleasure: _Albert Tay_ at \[22\]. Yong CJ held that as video camcorders were freely available and considering policy considerations, there was a need for the Courts to impose deterrent sentences to indicate to the public that offences of this sort would not be tolerated: _Albert Tay_ at \[23\].

36     In _Chong Hou En_, Chan J held at \[65\]:

>     … I am in agreement that **general deterrence is particularly relevant**. Given the fact that mobile phones with camera functions are now ubiquitous and that cameras with recording functions come in all shapes, sizes and disguises and are getting cheaper to acquire, the perverse now find it easier to prey on unsuspecting women almost anywhere **… the need for general deterrence is even more pressing now than during the time that Albert Tay was decided, given how far technology has advanced**. … In addition, the **ease with which videos can be uploaded onto the Internet for dissemination in this day and age further warrants the need for general deterrence**. Unimaginable shame and distress to the victim may be caused if the videos are disseminated to worldwide via the Internet. Although in this case no videos were uploaded and disseminated, the danger, which is not fanciful but very real, that it could have happened is sufficient to warrant a deterrent sentence. I am in full agreement that a strong message should be sent to those who harbour thoughts of abusing these advancements in technology.

\[ **Emphasis mine**\]

37     Chan J held that aggravating factors included: (i) a high degree of intrusion (for instance where the victims were recorded fully naked); (ii) where there were multiple victims; (iii) if the victims were young; (iv) where video recording technology was used; and (v) where there was a high degree of planning and premeditation: _Chong Hou En_ at \[68\] referring to \[14\].

38     Whilst Chan J was loath to establish a custodial benchmark for all s 509 of the PC offences involving the use of technology he nonetheless held a custodial sentence would be warranted if aggravating factors such as multiple victims, young victims, a high degree of intrusion or planning and premeditation were present: _Chong Hou En_ at \[77\].

39     Therefore, I found that general deterrence has been the primary sentencing consideration for s 509 offences where the Accused has used a recording device since _Albert Tay_. The need for deterrent sentences has increased with the advancements in technology since _Albert Tay_.

40     In _Ryan You_, I held at \[42\], on the authority of _Chong Hou En_, that if any of the aggravating factors listed at paragraph 37 above, and more so a combination of those aggravating factors, in addition to the use of a recording device, were present in a section 509 case, then a custodial sentence was warranted. In fact, I was of the opinion that the use of a recording device in combination with **one** other aggravating factor, such as planning and premeditation, a high level of intrusion or multiple or young victims would justify the imposition of a custodial sentence. This finding is equally applicable to the present case and I found that in view of the aggravating factors, set out below, the custodial threshold had been crossed. Again, to their credit, the Defence did not deny that the custodial threshold had been crossed.

#### Aggravating factors

##### (1)   Use of a recording device

41     The Accused’s use of a recording devices to commit the offences was an aggravating factor. This was especially so since mobile phones with in-built cameras and recording ability are now ubiquitous. In addition, it is now common for pedestrians to walk whilst holding their mobile phones and surfing the internet or using the phones. Thus, an offender holding a phone would not immediately raise the suspicion of victims or other pedestrians. This would make detection of these upskirting offences all the more difficult. This was certainly so in the present case as the Accused had managed to record 109 videos over a period of ten months without getting caught.

42     The Statement of Facts disclosed that the Accused’s mobile phone and desktop computer were seized as part of the investigations and that the 109 offending videos were extracted. However, the Statement of Facts does not make it clear whether the videos were extracted solely from the Accused’s mobile phone or whether the Accused had downloaded some, or all, of the videos to his desktop computer. Regardless, the Accused had clearly not deleted the videos after he had taken them. This gave rise to the possibility of repeated viewing by the Accused and/or further dissemination. The potential harm associated with possible dissemination of the videos was all the more acute in this case as the faces of a number of the victims were also captured in the videos taken by the Accused. If the videos had been disseminated, then the victims may have been identifiable leading to greater trauma to them. For these reasons, I found that the retention of the videos by the Accused was an aggravating factor.

43     I accepted that the Accused had not disseminated the videos, however, the fact that there was no actual dissemination was not a mitigating factor it was merely the absence of a more aggravating factor.

##### (2)   Multiple victims and persistent and habitual offending.

44     I found that the Accused’s offending was persistent and habitual as evidenced by the fact that the Accused committed 109 separate offences over a period of 10 months and that the vast majority of his victims were junior college students. The existence of multiple victims and coupled with the fact that the frequency of the Accused’s offending was relatively high were aggravating factors.

##### (3)   Planning and premeditation.

45     In _Pram Nair_, the Court of Appeal held that appellant’s actions of separating the victim from her friends and taking her to the beach in order to commit the offence was not indicative of premeditation: _Prem Nair_ at \[133\]. The appellant had not specifically offered drugs or soporifics to the victim in order reduce her resistance to him, sexually groom the victim or deliberately isolate her by meeting her at a secluded location. The Court of Appeal held that these would be examples of a high degree of deliberation and planning: _Prem Nair_ at \[134\].

46     I found that there was clearly no sophisticated planning or premeditation exhibited by the Accused. The Accused did not use an elaborate set up, for instance mini-cameras, disguised cameras or specialist phone applications to mask his offending. The Accused had not targeted persons that he knew and then followed these victims to commit the offences or set up situations that would allow him to capture upskirt videos with more ease. If such sophisticated planning and premeditation had existed, this would amount to further aggravating factors and would warrant an uplift to the sentence.

47     However, this was not to say that there was no planning in the Accused’s offending behaviour as he had specific goals that he wanted to achieve as a result of his offending. I would disagree with a characterisation of the Accused’s offending behaviour as being opportunistic. The Accused has admitted that he had a modus operandi and that as part of the modus operandi he preferred his victims to be below the age of 18 and junior college girls in their school uniform. As such, he targeted his victims at locations near to junior colleges. Of the 109 videos in the proceeded charge 101 were of victims wearing their school uniform.

48     In _GCO v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1402</span>_, the appellant had been outside a female toilet at his hall of residence when he heard the sound of someone showering. He then decided to enter the toilet to peep at the victim. He entered the toilet went to the adjoining cubicle and then peeped at the victim. See J held that the offence by the Accused was not premeditated as there was nothing to suggest that the appellant had applied a great deal of foresight or planning prior to committing the offence: _GCO_ at \[101\]. See J accepted that the appellant was overcome by a sudden and inexplicable urge to peep: _GCO_ at \[102\].

49     Unlike the appellant in _GCO_ the Accused’s was not overcome by a sudden and inexplicable urge to take upskirt or downblouse videos of this victims. I found that the Accused was clearly goal-oriented as he targeted a particular class of victim, namely young junior college students. In addition, the frequency of the Accused’s offending and the sheer number of victims would also suggest that this was not a momentary aberration but rather a course of conduct that the Accused had set himself on. Therefore, whilst the methodology used by the Accused did not indicate sophisticated planning the fact that he was goal-oriented was an aggravating factor.

##### (4)   Age of the victims.

50     The Prosecution submitted that as the Accused targeted victims who were young and as he had a penchant for victims who were below the age of 18 this should be considered an aggravating factor. I disagreed with this submission. I am guided by the decision in _Rachel Ann Fernandez_ that for age to indicate vulnerability there would have to be an impact on the victim’s mental faculties, something to indicate an increased dependency on others or a proclivity to misplacing trust and that if there was an exploitation of a particular vulnerability in the victims the Prosecution would have to point out this vulnerability: _Rachel Ann Fernandez_ at \[12\]. In the present case, there was no explanation as to why the victims, who were junior college students aged between 16 and 18, were vulnerable. I found that the Accused had not exploited any vulnerability in the victim and, consequently, that this should not be considered an aggravating factor.

51     Chan J had held that it was an aggravating factor if voyeurism offences were committed against young victims: _Chong Hou En_ at \[14 and 68\]. In that case some of the victims were 12 years old when the respondent filmed them whilst showered. The victims in the present case, being between 16 and 18 years old would be more mature than the young victims in _Chong Hou En_ and, as such, I did not think that the age of the victims in this case should be considered an aggravating factor.

52     In oral arguments, the Prosecution submitted that the age of the victims would affect their self-awareness, and this somehow made them more vulnerable. The Prosecution did not elaborate on this point, on what was meant by their self-awareness or how this would make them vulnerable. I would also note that in fact the victims, the majority of which were unidentified, would not have been aware that an offence had been committed against them. As the Prosecution had not elaborated on this point, I did not give any weight to it.

##### (5)   Offences committed at or near public transport areas.

53     I accepted that it was an aggravating factor if offences are committed on public transport or in public transport areas.

##### (6)   Effect of the TIC charges.

54     In _Terence Ng_ the Court of Appeal, held that the fact that there were two charges of statutory rape taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing would almost invariably result in an increase in the sentence imposed. The Court of Appeal had referred _PP v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> at \[38\], where is was held that whilst a court was not bound to increase a sentence merely because there are TIC offences, “it will normally do so where the TIC offences are of similar nature”: _Terence Ng_ at \[64(a)\] and \[90\].

55     In the present case, the TIC charges were for the exact same conduct as the proceeded charge. I disagreed with the Defence submission that the TIC charges were given no weight in _Terence Ng_, rather that aggravating weight was given to the TIC charges but this was cancelled out by the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty thus sparing the victim the ordeal of having to testify in Court.

56     In the present case, the Accused was caught red-handed in that the offending videos were discovered on the Accused’s mobile phone and desktop computer. As such, it was arguable that the Prosecution would not have had difficulty in prosecuting and securing a conviction against the Accused had he claimed trial. In addition, in _Terence Ng_, the victim was spared the ordeal of having to recount the sexual encounters that she had with the appellant and there would be a real and tangible benefit to the victim in sparing her the trauma of having to relive the events. The need to spare victims, most of whom were unidentified, the trauma of having to testify in Court was not as acute in the present case. Therefore, I did not find that the Accused’s plea of guilt would cancel out the aggravating effect of the TIC charges.

57     I also found that the TIC charges, in particular, MCN 900746 of 2020, which was a charge amalgamated under s 124(4), which disclosed that the Accused had committed a further seven upskirting offences between 23 May 2018 and 24 August 2018, showed that the period of the Accused’s offending was longer and the number of victims was higher than was apparent from the proceeded charge alone. Therefore, I found that weight should be given to the TIC charges and that there should be an uplift to the sentence to take into account the TIC charges.

58     In view of the aggravating factors present in this case I found that general deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration and that the custodial threshold had been crossed.

#### Mitigating factors

##### (1)   Remorse, cooperation and crime-free record

59     I accepted that the Accused was remorseful. He had indicated his intention to plead guilty at an early stage and I accepted that this was an expression of his remorse. I accepted that the Accused had fully cooperated with the authorities. This was the Accused’s first brush with the law, and I accepted that this was a mitigating factor.

##### (2)   The Accused’s psychiatric condition

60     The Accused tendered a psychiatric report from Changi General Hospital. Dr Yap Hwa Ling opined that the Accused was suffering from a voyeuristic disorder, however, there was no indication that this disorder affected his ability to control his impulses or that there was a causal or contributory link between the disorder and the Accused’s offending. As such, I did not ascribe mitigating weight to the Accused’s disorder.

61     I found that the mitigating factors were insufficiently strong to justify the imposition of a non-custodial sentence.

#### The length of the custodial sentence

62     The Prosecution and the Defence referred to sentencing precedents to support the length of the custodial sentence that they sought. I will refer to the sentencing precedents that I found to be closest to the present case in terms of the number of offences or incidents.

63     In _Public Prosecutor v Ho Wen Shen Benjamin_ (SC-904531-2019), the offender pleaded guilty to three charges under s 509 of the PC read with s 124(4) of the CPC. In 2018 alone the offender had on at least 93 occasions taken upskirt photographs of female victims. There was no sophisticated planning and premeditation in this case, however, the offender had also taken photographs of his known associates and he had meticulously arranged and curated the photographs on his computer. There were also three TIC charges.

64     Whilst I found that there were similarities between the offence committed by the Accused and the offence committed by the offender in _Ho Wen Shen_ in 2018 in terms of the duration of the offences and the number of victims, I nonetheless found that the culpability of the offender in _Ho Wen Shen_ was higher than the Accused as he had targeted known victims and he had curated the photographs he had taken. I found that the sentence in the present case should not exceed the sentence of seven months’ imprisonment per charge imposed in _Ho Wen Shen._

65     In _Public Prosecutor v Goh Han Jie_ (SC-909791-2020), the offender pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 509 of the PC read with s 124(4) of the CPC for recording 54 videos over a period of approximately three months. There did not appear to be any premeditation or sophisticated planning by the offender. One charge was TIC’ed.

66     I found that the offence committed by the current Accused was more egregious than the offender in _Goh Han Jie_ as the current Accused was goal-oriented, had recorded far more videos and over a longer period of time. As such, I found that the sentence for the present case should be more that the 16 weeks’ imprisonment imposed on the offender in _Goh Han Jie._

67     In _Public Prosecutor v Desmond Teh Yu Kiat_ (SC-901489-2020), the offender pleaded guilty to, _inter alia_, a charge under s 509 of the PC read with s 124(4) of the CPC for taking upskirt videos of 75 victims. Much like the present Accused, the offender, did not demonstrate any particular premeditation or sophisticated planning in his offending. However, the offender had also captured the faces of the victims.

68     I found that the offence committed by the current Accused was more egregious than the offender in _Desmond Teh_ as the current Accused was goal oriented and had recorded more videos. As such, I found that the custodial sentence in the present case should be longer than 20 weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Desmond Teh_.

69     In _Public Prosecutor v Chia Teck Huat_ (SC-903558-2020), the offender pleaded guilty, _inter alia_, to an offence under s 509 of the PC read with s 124(4) of the CPC for recording 117 upskirt videos. The offender had a more sophisticated set up in that he used a mini-camera placed in his computer bag to take the videos. However, I found that the offence in _Chia Teck Huat_ was not as egregious at the present case as the offender was not goal-oriented and that there were additional mitigating factors such as a delay in prosecution and the fact that the offender had attended extensive counselling sessions. As such, I found that the custodial sentence in the present case should be longer than the 18 weeks’ imprisonment imposed for that charge in _Chia Teck Huat._

70     In _Public Prosecutor v Chen WeiDa_ (SC-903535-2020), the offender pleaded guilty, _inter alia_, to an offence under s 509 of the PC read with s 124(4) of the CPC for recording 249 upskirt videos. The offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. I found that whilst the number of videos recorded by the offender in _Chen WeiDa_ was greater than the number recorded by the Accused, the Accused’s culpability was the same as the offender in _Chen WeiDa_ in view of the aggravating factors in this case. The offender in _Chen WeiDa_ had been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and I found that a similar sentence would be appropriate in this case.

71     I did not think the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Ho Yan Liang Shaun_ (MCN-900242-2020) or _Public Prosecutor_ v _Chu Ben Wee_ (MAC-900177-2020 & Others) were instructive as these two cases involved a far larger number of videos and this was reflected in the longer custodial sentences imposed in those cases.

72     With reference to the Prosecution’s table of “Non-amalgamated charges under section 509 PC featuring a high number of victims”, I found that in terms of the scope of offending the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ang Zhu Ci Joshua_ share similarities with the present case. In that case, the offender had committed 127 s 509 offences over a period of approximately three years. The number of incidents was on par with the current case. In addition, there does not appear to have been any additional level of sophistication in that case. The offender in _Ang Zhu Ci_ was sentenced, on appeal, to 24 weeks’ imprisonment. I found that a similar sentence would be appropriate in the present case.

## Conclusion

73     I found that general deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration in this case. I found that there were aggravating factors and that in view of these factors the objective of deterrence would be met by the imposition of a custodial sentence. Taking into account the aggravating factors, giving due weight to the mitigating factors and considering the sentencing precedents I sentenced the Accused to six months’ imprisonment. I found that the sentence adequately reflected the need for general deterrence.

74     Finally, I would express my gratitude to the Prosecution and Defence for their well-reasoned arguments, both written and oral, and the invaluable assistance that they rendered to me.
