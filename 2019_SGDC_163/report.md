## TIC charges

4       The Accused admitted and consented to 5 other drug related charges, namely, 4 drug possession charges and one charge for the possession of drug utensils intended for the consumption of drug.

## Antecedents

5       The Accused was traced. In February 2016, he was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment for drug consumption. He had also been placed under drug supervision in July 2017 for a period of 24 months.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

6       The prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.

7       Based on the cases of _Soh Qiu Xia katty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span> and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span>, the Prosecution stated that the starting point for the present case involving the trafficking of 12.44g of methamphetamine would be 5 years’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane.

8       As for the charge for drug possession, the Prosecution submitted for a jail term of 1 year’s imprisonment based on the case of _PP v Hayzal Bin Mohamad Riduan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 122</span>.

9       The Prosecution submitted for the mandatory minimum sentence for the drug consumption charge.

## Mitigation Plea and submission on Sentence by Defence

10     Counsel in his written submissions contended that the main sentencing consideration ought to be rehabilitation and not retribution or deterrence.

11     With respect to counsel, I was of the view that personal background and circumstances of the Accused were of any or little mitigating value as it were not so exceptional. I also did not agree that one can resort to drug to relieve pain and insomnia without proper authorization or prescription from a registered medical practitioner.

12     It was submitted that the Accused had pleaded guilty and was remorseful.

13     Counsel also contended that the Accused was not a hardened or recalcitrant offender.

14     The Defence urged the court to impose the minimum mandated sentence of 3 years for the drug consumption charge (DAC 941340/2018).

15     In respect of the drug trafficking charge (DAC 932535/2018), counsel submitted that based on _Soh Qiu Xia v PP_, supra, the indicative starting point of sentence in the present case should be between an imprisonment term of 5 years to 5 years 4 months and 5 strokes of the cane. He also highlighted that in past cases where the quantity of drugs involved was heavier yet the minimum mandatory sentence was imposed. One such case was _PP v Muhammad Nor Haiqal bin Shaman_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 292</span> which involved the trafficking of 97.9gm of methamphetamine, the court imposed the minimum mandatory the sentence of 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane. The offender also had 2 additional charges of trafficking methamphetamine taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. On a closer examination of the case, it shows that the offender was only 20 years old at the time of arrest and was convicted of 3 drug related offences, namely 2 drug trafficking charges and 1 drug consumption charge. The offender was sentenced to a total sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment with 20 strokes of the cane being the sentences of 23 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for trafficking 249.99g of methamphetamine and 1 year’s imprisonment for the consumption of methamphetamine. The minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years and 5 strokes of the cane was ordered to run concurrently. One possible explanation for this could be that any uplift from the minimum mandatory sentence would not be necessary in view of the aggregate sentence imposed. I was therefore of the view that the facts of that case were different from the present case.

16     Next, counsel also referred to a number of district court cases where the minimum mandatory sentence was imposed. But many of these cases were decided before _Soh Qiu Xia katty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span> and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span>. Hence, they would not be of much guidance.

17     Another case referred by counsel was _PP v Seng Kian Hong Philip_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 289</span>. In this case, the offender pleaded guilty to 7 charges, with 12 charges taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. The court gave a global sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. I was aware that the drug quantity involved was heavier but this case has to be considered in the light of the totality principle. I also noted that the offender had no drug related antecedents. The particular mandatory minimum sentence was ordered to run concurrently.

18     In my view, ultimately the sentence to be imposed in each case would depend on the specific circumstances of the case: _Vasentha d/o Jospeh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> at \[48\].

## Sentencing Considerations

19     With due respect to counsel, given the nature of the offence committed and the gravity of the offences, clearly the main sentencing consideration must be one of general and specific deterrence.

20     In considering the sentences to be imposed I gave credit to the Accused for his plea of guilt, his full co-operation and his remorsefulness. I have indicated above at \[11\] that the personal background highlighted, in my view, warranted no or little mitigating weight .

21     Contrary to the defence contention, I was of the view that the Accused was a hardened or recalcitrant offender. This can be discerned from his drug related antecedents. He has progressed from being an addict to a drug trafficker. The 24 months of drug supervision which the Accused underwent appeared to be ineffective and failed to keep him away from drug. It showed his lack of commitment to reform or that the penalties given were of no deterrent value at all.

22     Based on _Soh Qiu Xia katty v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span> and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span>, the Defence conceded that for the drug trafficking charge, the indicative starting point of sentence in the present case should be between an imprisonment term of 5 years to 5 years 4 months and 5 strokes of the cane. Having considered the mitigation and aggravating factors, I was of the view that an uplift of 4 months’ imprisonment above the minimum mandatory imprisonment sentence of 5 years was appropriate. This was still within the range of sentence submitted by the Defence.

23     In the present case, having considered the circumstances of the case, I was of the view that mitigating factors were outweighed by the following aggravating factors.

24     Firstly, the Accused was not a first-time offender. He also has drug-related antecedents.

25     Very soon after spending a period of incarceration and undergone drug supervision, the Accused re-offended in September 2018. As mentioned earlier, he has progressed from being an addict to become a drug trafficker. There was also no concrete evidence that the Accused has taken steps to change for the better. Clearly a deterrent sentence was warranted both specifically and generally.

26     Next, the Accused had 5 other drug related charges taken into account for the purpose of sentencing. These were mainly for the possession of a variety of Class A controlled drugs.

27     Finally, I was of the view that there was premeditation in the commission of the drug trafficking charge. This is supported by the SOF. The SOF stated that the Accused had bought a total of 5 sets of the drug for about $800 and these were to be sold for profits. Indeed, one of these had been sold for $270. A digital weighing scale had also been recovered. These indicated clearly there was premeditation in the commission of the offence.

28     In these circumstances, I was of the view that an uplift of 4 months’ imprisonment in respect of the drug trafficking charge was necessary to give due weight to the requirement of deterrence to be reflected in the global sentence.

29     As for the drug possession charge (DAC 941343/2018), Counsel submitted for a jail term of not more than 9 months in his written submissions. In court, counsel contended for a sentence of up to 10 months’ imprisonment. I sentenced the Accused to a jail term of 1 year which was the sentence of between 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment based on the sentencing precedents submitted by the parties. I was of the view that it was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case, the mitigating and aggravating factors mentioned above.

30     In respect of the drug consumption charge (DAC 941340/2019), the Accused was sentenced to the minimum mandatory sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

31     Having determined the individual sentences for each of the charges, I then proceeded to determine which of the sentences were to run consecutively for an appropriate global sentence having regard to the totality of the accused person’s criminal behaviour. Accordingly, I ordered the sentences in the drug possession charge (DAC 941343/2018) and drug trafficking charge (DAC 932535/2018) to run consecutively. I was of the view that the aggregate sentence of 6 years 4 months’ imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane was not substantially above the range of sentences normally imposed for the most serious offence which in this case was the drug trafficking charge. The sentence was backdated to 29 September 2018.

32     The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
