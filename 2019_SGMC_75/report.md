2 December 2019

### District Judge Toh Han Li:

1       This is an appeal by the accused against sentence.

## The charge

2       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> _MAC-908311-2019_

> _You.are charged that you, on the 14th day of July 2018, at or about 8.05pm, on board bus service 174 bearing plate number SBS8048L, which was proceeding from Boon Lay Bus Interchange towards Boon Lay Drive, did use criminal force on xxx (“the victim”) a 23-year-old female passenger, intending to ourage her modesty, to wit, by touching the left side of her left breast over her clothes with your left hand in a pulsating motion, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## Statement of Facts

3       The accused is Ramakrishnan Anbu, a male 49-year-old Indian national and Singapore Permanent Resident. He was working as a Production Planner at the material time.

4       The victim is a 23-year-old female.

5       On 14 July 2018, at about 8.05pm, the bus captain of bus service 174 traveling along Jurong Road towards Bukit Batok called “999” informing that “174 bus captain. There is a passenger complain of molest. I just stop the bus. My plate number is SBS8048L.” The incident location was given as Jurong Road towards Bukit Batok, “First Bus Stop”.

6       On 14 July 2018 at about 7.50pm, the victim was heading home with her family and boarded bus service 174 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange. The victim sat near the back of the bus, taking the window seat such that the window was on her left, while her family sat two rows behind her.

7       Sometime about 8.00pm, the accused boarded the bus along Boon Lay Avenue, and initially sat on the seats that were across the aisle from the victim. At that point in time, there were other passengers seated in the row directly behind the victim. When those passengers left their seat to alight from the bus, the accused left his original seat and went to sit directly behind the victim, next to the window as well.

8       As the bus continued traveling, at or about 8.05pm, the accused, with the intention to outrage the modesty of the victim, used his left hand to touch the left side of the accused’s left breast with a pulsating touch that lasted at least two seconds. The victim immediately turned towards the direction of the touch, and saw the accused’s left hand at the left side of her seat, in the space between the window and her chair. When the victim noticed the accused, the accused immediately retracted his left hand.

9       The victim confronted the accused who had then closed his eyes, pretending to be asleep. He then woke up and pressed the bell to signal to the bus driver that he intended to alight at the next stop. The victim hurriedly told the bus captain that she was molested. The bus captain then stopped the bus and called for the police.

## Antecedents

10     The accused is a first offender.

## Prosecutions submission on sentence

11     The prosecution submitted that as breasts were intruded on public transport, the case fell within the lower end of Band 2 of Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“Kunasekaran’s case”) and asked for a sentence of not less than 5 months imprisonment. It also relied on the following sentencing precedents:

12      **PP v Andy Yung Sie Hau, MAC 911196-2017**. The 22 year old accused, was at a bus-stop with the victim. The victim felt someone bumped her on the lower back as she was waiting at the busstop, which caused her to move slightly forward. She then felt the accused squeezing the upper part of her left breast with his hand. She shouted for help and saw the accused running away wearing a surgical mask. The accused was traced with CCTV assistance. The accused had initially seen another female Chinese on board a bus and decided to follow her after alighting from the bus. He followed this lady to her block before walking back to his own block. He then saw the victim sitting alone at the bus-stop and thought of touching her. He donned the surgical mask to avoid being recognised, ran towards her and molested her before running away. He was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment.

13      **PP v Kundu Pronoy Kumar, MAC 901453-2018**. The 39 year old accused had gone to the MRT station toilet. While he was inside, the victim came by and wanted to enter to clean it but saw people inside. She then placed a cone and cleaning equipment outside the toilet and waited for everyone to leave the toilet. The accused smiled at her and was the last person to leave. As the accused walked out of the toilet he tried to talk to the victim in English but she could not understand him. He then gave her a piece of paper with his handphone number on it. Not knowing what it was for the victim simply took the paper and pocketed it. She then entered the toilet with her cleaning equipment. As she was mopping the accused re-entered the toilet, walked up to the victim, placed his hand on her left shoulder and kissed her left cheek once. He then hugged her from behind and grabbed her breast intending to outrage her modesty. The victim asked the accused 'Why?' in Malay. The accused then left the toilet. He was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

14      **PP v Muhammad Syihabuddin, MAC 906631-2017**. The victim was in her school uniform and was sitting at a concrete ledge eating when she noticed the 26 year old accused looking at her. Feeling uneasy she moved to sit at a nearby bus-stop. The accused joined her and sat next to her on her left. The victim did not dare to look at him and looked at her mobile phone. Suddenly, she felt the accused lean towards her with his right hand going around her back while using his left hand to grope her left breast over her clothing, intending to outrage her modesty. The victim screamed and shifted away. The accused stood up, grinned at her and strolled away. He was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment.

15     It submitted that whatever compensation was offered in the present case was irrelevant and the offer to compound the offence had been rejected by the victim.

## Mitigation plea

16     In mitigation, defence counsel highlighted the following background facts:

17     He is a Singapore Permanent Resident and has lived in Singapore for more than 20 years.

18     He is married with no children due to medical complications with his wife who underwent a hysterectomy in 2016 when her womb was removed, as a result of which his wife suffers from depression and is dependant on the accused for emotional support. He is the sole breadwinner and also financially supports his family in India.

19     With regard to the offence, the defence raised the following points:

20     The commission of the offence was not in keeping with his character and was a momentary lapse in judgment which he regrets deeply. He is deeply contrite and remorseful for his act. He had contacted the investigating officer to hand over an apology letter and a sum of $1,000 as compensation.

21     He had admitted his mistake from the outset, is untraced and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He accepts that the commission of the offence on public transport was an aggravating factor but submits that the touching of the breast occurred over the victim’s clothing, there was no skin to skin contact, the touch was fleeting and no force or violence was used.

22     In its written submissions, the defence submitted two newspapers articles from the Straits Times dated 27 September 2019 and the New Paper dated 26 June 2019 where fines were imposed on the accused even though these acts of molest appeared to be premeditated and more egregious. The defence accordingly asked for a fine of between $3,000 and $5,000 to imposed on the accused.

23     In court, defence counsel said that it was not disputing that the custodial threshold had been crossed. Nonetheless, it reiterated that the case was within band 1 Kunasekaran’s case and sought to distinguish the precedents cited by the prosecution: Andy Yung’s case a surgical mask had been worn by the accused, in Kundu’s case the accused had also kissed the victim’s left cheek and hugged her and in Muhammad Syihabuddin’s case the victim was a school student.

## Sentencing principles

24     In Kunasekaran’s case, Chan Seng Onn J adopted for use in s 354(1) Penal Code cases See Kee Oon J’s two-step sentencing framework for s 354(2) Penal Code cases in GBR v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> as follows:

25     Under the “two-step sentencing bands” approach, sentencing for offences under s 354(1) of the Penal Code for outrage of modesty _simpliciter_ would thus take place in two steps. First, the court would consider the following offence specific factors: (a) the degree of sexual exploitation; (b) the circumstances of the offence; and (c) the harm caused to the victim. Based on the consideration of the foregoing offence-specific factors, the court should ascertain the gravity of the offence and then place the offence within any of the following three bands of imprisonment:

> Band 1: This includes cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts. The sentence to be imposed would be less than five months’ imprisonment.

> Band 2: This includes cases where two or more of the offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception. The sentence to be imposed would be five to 15 months’ imprisonment.

> Band 3: This includes cases where numerous offence specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim. The sentence to be imposed would be 15 to 24 months’ imprisonment.

26     At the second step, the court would consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that related to the offender generally but which were not offence-specific (_ie_, offender-specific factors).

## The offence-specific aggravating factors

27     Applying the Kunasekaran framework, I begin by considering the relevant offence-specific aggravating factors.

#### Degree of sexual exploitation

28     In the present case, the accused had touched the victim’s breast albeit over the clothes. I consider this as intruding upon the private parts of the victim even if there was no skin to skin contact and that it was a fleeting touch.

#### Circumstances of the offence

29     The present offence took place on board a public transport vehicle. In Kunasekaran’s case, Chan J observed “the growing need for the courts to deter offenders from committing outrage of modesty cases on public transport has been highlighted on multiple occasions in Parliament \[at para 58\].”

30     The defence concedes this as an aggravating factor.

31     Next, I note that there was some degree of planning before the act of molest as the accused had left his original seat on the bus to sit behind the victim after the seat was vacated by passengers who had alighted. He then molested her from behind with his left hand in the space between the window and her chair. When the victim confronted him, he did not admit to the offence but instead pretended to be asleep but was subsequently apprehended when the victim alerted the bus captain.

## The appropriate sentencing band

32     In this case, the accused had intruded the victim’s private parts, namely her breast albeit over her clothes. The offence was committed on public transport, and there was some degree of planning as the accused has specifically switched seats to be in a position to molest the victim. When confronted by her, he did not admit his wrongdoing but pretended to be asleep. On a combination of these factors, I agree with the prosecution that this brings the case comfortably into the lower end of Band 2 with a starting point of 5-6 months imprisonment.

## Offender-specific factors

33     In Kunasekaran’s case Chan J recognised that “a plea of guilt is regarded as a mitigating factor that might entitle an offender to a reduced sentence because the plea of guilt: (a) can be a subjective expression of genuine remorse and contrition, which can be taken into account as a personal mitigating factor; (b) spares the victim the ordeal of having to testify, thereby saving the victim the horror of having to relive the incident; and (c) saves the resources of the State which would otherwise have been expended if there were a trial \[at 66\].”

34     I therefore was prepared to give the accused a sentencing discount on account of his plea of guilt.

35     On his letter of apology and offer of compensation, I took these as neutral factors as these events had taken place after he was arrested. In any event, he did not own up when confronted by the victim and instead pretended to be asleep.

36     Both the prosecution and the accused had cited sentencing precedents for s 354 Penal Code cases. I am mindful of Chan J cautionary note in Kunasekaran’s case that “….sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations are of relatively little, if any, precedential value because they are unreasoned and hence it will not be possible to discern what had weighed on the mind of the sentencing judge or why the sentencing judge had approached the matter in a particular way… \[at para 62\]”.

37     With regard to the two newspaper cases cited by the accused, these did not involve the touching of breasts but rather the victim’s thigh. I therefore did not find these cases helpful. The three cases cited by the prosecution had more similarities with the present case where the victim’s breast had been intruded over her clothes. Having said that, there were also some differences such as the wearing of a surgical mask in Andy Yung’s case, additional contact such as the kissing of the victim’s cheek in Kundu’s case and the fact that the victim was a school girl in Muhammad Syihabuddin’s case. The sentences imposed in those three cases ranged from 5 to 6 months.

38     In the circumstances, applying a discount to the starting point of 5-6 months in view of the accused’s plea of guilt, on, I imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment on the accused.

39     The accused was granted a deferment of sentence and filed an appeal prior to serving sentence. He was granted a stay of execution pending appeal and is currently on bail bond of $10,000.
