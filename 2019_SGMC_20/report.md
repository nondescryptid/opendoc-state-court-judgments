Civil Procedure – Setting aside

Civil Procedure – Simplified process – Upfront discovery

10 June 2019

### Deputy Registrar Chua Wei Yuan:

1       This was the defendant’s application to set aside a judgment entered in default of defence. I set aside the judgment essentially on the twin bases that it had been irregular and that the defendant was not bound to lose. My reasons follow.

## Facts

2       The plaintiff sued on a dishonoured cheque for $50,000, which it said represented the refund of a deposit given on account of the defendant being unable to perform its end of an agreement. The defendant’s position, as appears from the affidavits filed on its behalf, was that the cheque had been unsupported by consideration, that it had been delivered conditionally (and should not have been encashed), and in any event that the notice of dishonour was defective.

3       The writ and statement of claim (“SOC”) were served on 22 November 2018. These were, purportedly in compliance with O 108 r 2(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), accompanied by a list of documents (“LOD”).

4       There is no dispute that the last day to file a defence would have been 14 December 2018. It transpired, however, that the serial number of the cheque and the bank through which the cheque had been issued (as pleaded in the SOC) were wrong. The parties realised this, for on that day the defendant did not file its defence, but instead sent the plaintiff a letter requesting further and better particulars of the SOC and a copy of the cheque referred to in the SOC.

5       On 18 December 2018, the plaintiff filed and served an amended SOC to correct the errors. The defendant did not dispute that the plaintiff was entitled to do so. By virtue of O 20 r 3(2)(_b_) and O 3 r 3, the time allowed for the filing of a defence would have been extended to 2 January 2019.

6       By virtue of O 108 r 2(5), the plaintiff would have had to provide a copy of the cheque to the defendant by 21 December 2018. (Parties did not dispute this point, even though the cheque was not listed in the LOD. In this regard, O 108 r 2(5) requires a party to provide a copy of any document listed in the LOD. I can only presume this was because the cheque was referred to in the SOC and _should have been_ listed in the LOD. I return to this point below at \[34\].) However, it was only on 3 January 2019—after the defendant had sent some chasers—that the plaintiff furnished the defendant with a copy of the cheque referred to in the amended SOC (the particulars requested were not forthcoming).

7       On 7 January 2019, the defendant filed and served an application, essentially for further and better particulars, and for an extension of time (until 14 days after that application was disposed of) to serve its defence on the plaintiff.

8       On 8 January 2019, the plaintiff filed a request to enter judgment on the amended SOC in default of defence. This was accepted into the electronic case file on 10 January 2019, just after counsel for the plaintiff sought an audience before the duty registrar asking about the status of the request.

9       Shortly after, the defendant filed this application to set aside the judgment.

## Decision

10     The defendant argued that the judgment was irregular and, in any event, there were triable issues.

### Was the judgment irregular?

11     In brief, the defendant raised 3 lines of argument as regards the regularity of the judgment:

(a)     that the plaintiff acted despite knowing of a pending application by the defendant to extend the time for filing its defence;

(b)     that the plaintiff had acted in breach of natural justice and did not give full and frank disclosure to the court; and

(c)     that the plaintiff did not comply with its discovery obligations under O 108.

12     I did not consider the judgment irregular for the exact reasons advanced by the defendant. However, its arguments as regards discovery obligations led me to take notice of some other matters which made the judgment irregular.

#### Knowledge of pending application to extend time to file defence

13     The defendant argues that the plaintiff entered default judgment despite knowing that it had filed an application for particulars and for an extension of time to file its defence.[^1]

14     In my view, the plaintiff is not obligated to refrain from entering default judgment in the light of the pending application (or its knowledge that the application is pending).

15     In _BSN Commercial Bank (M) Bhd v Zaq Construction Sdn Bhd & Others_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 4 MLJ 472</span> (HC, Kuala Lumpur) at 476C, Abdul Aziz J restored a judgment that had been set aside below, precisely because the defendants had no legal authority to say that default judgment could not be entered while an application for an extension of time to serve its defence was pending. Similarly, an application to stay court proceedings in favour of arbitration does not pause the timer for serving a defence (_Australian Timber Products Pte Ltd v Koh Brothers Building & Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 168</span> (“_Australian Timber_”) at \[16\] _per_ Belinda Ang Saw Ean J). Ang J in fact thought that the defendant there could have been proactive by, for example, asking the duty registrar for an urgent hearing of the stay application and an extension of time to serve the defence under O 3 r 4.

16     I am aware that a seemingly different result was reached in _Carona Holdings Pte Ltd and others v Go Go Delicacy Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 460</span> (CA). There, after the writ had been served, the defendants applied for a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration but did not file a defence. After the time limited for filing a defence had lapsed, the plaintiff filed an _inter partes_ application for judgment to be entered in default of defence. Both applications were fixed for hearing together, whereupon an assistant registrar entered judgment and made no order on the stay application. The High Court judge, relying on _Australian Timber_, affirmed this result on appeal. On further appeal, V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court) held at \[37\]–\[38\] that the merits of a stay application should always be heard first if applications for a stay and default judgment are concurrently pending. That case, however, concerned the unusual situation where the plaintiff filed an **inter partes** **_application_** to enter judgment in default of defence instead of a **_request_** (as required today by Practice Direction 76). The consequence is that there were two _applications concurrently pending_. Such was not the situation in the present case. In fact, Rajah JA stated at \[32\]:

… **far from suggesting that the timelines in the Rules of Court will stop on the filing of a stay application, Chao JA was in fact alluding to quite the opposite**. By observing (at \[18\] of \[_Samsung Corp v Chinese Chamber Realty Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 1 SLR(R) 382</span>\]) that, in the event of the failure of the stay application, “the court would no doubt make the necessary consequential orders, including setting the time-limit for the filing of Defence”, the court in _Samsung Corp_ confirmed that **fidelity to the timelines in the Rules of Court must still be observed**. After the merits of the stay application have been found to be wanting, an unsuccessful defendant has to file his defence. The time limits for the filing of the defence can, at the same hearing, be set by the court. In a similar vein, _Australian Timber_ clarifies that **the onus lies on the defendant to bring forward the hearing date or apply for an extension of time to serve the defence, if a default judgment is to be avoided**. \[emphasis added\]

17     I return to the present case. The general rule is that, in the first place, an order for further and better particulars will not be made before the service of the defence unless the court considers it necessary or desirable to enable the defendant to plead, or for some other special reason (O 18 r 12(5)). Even if the defendant nonetheless took the view that the particulars had to be given before a defence could be filed, and that the extension of time meant so much to the defendant, then Ang J’s comments in _Australian Timber_ squarely apply to this case. The defendant could have sought, before the duty registrar, an urgent hearing date of the application or an extension of time to file the defence pending the disposal of the application. As long as the court has not extended the time for the filing of the defence, the plaintiff is not precluded from enter judgment in default of defence.

18     This matter, in my view, does not make the judgment irregular.

#### Breach of natural justice/lack of full and frank disclosure

19     The defendant raised a litany of complaints which it says amounted to either lack of full and frank disclosure or a breach of natural justice. It says that the plaintiff:

(a)     did not inform the defendant that on 8 Jan 2019 it filed a request to enter default judgment, until after the judgment was accepted into the case file on 10 Jan 2019;[^2]

(b)     did not copy the defendant in its letter to court that set out the correspondence between parties and requesting that default judgment be entered;[^3]

(c)     had attended before the duty registrar on 10 Jan 2019 without having informed the defendant or its solicitors of its intention to seek an audience;[^4] and

(d)     had, in its letter to court and attendance before the duty registrar, failed to inform the court of the fact that the defendant had filed an application to extend the time allowed to file its defence.[^5]

20     In my view, while these complaints raise a spectrum of concerns if they are true, none make the judgment irregular.

21      **_First_**, a plaintiff need not inform a defendant that it has filed a request to enter default judgment (whether or not either is represented). It is true that a solicitor must not enter default judgment against a represented party unless 2 working days have elapsed after he/she has notified that in writing of his/her intention to do so (Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) (“LPPCR”), r 28(1)). However, this is a rule of professional conduct that applies to solicitors; it is not a rule of procedure that applies as between the parties (see, _eg_, _Harsha Rajkumar Mirpuri (Mrs) née Subita Shewakram Samtani v Shanti Shewakram Samtani Mrs Shanti Haresh Chugani_ \[2018\] 5 SLR 984 at \[24\] _per_ Valerie Thean J). Accordingly, it is not my place to decide if this rule was breached; that is ordinarily a matter for another forum (_Then Khek Khoon and another v Arjun Permanand Samtani and another_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 451</span> at \[17\]–\[22\] (“_Then Khek Khoon_”) _per_ Quentin Loh J; _Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa and others_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 798</span> at \[6\] _per_ Choo Han Teck J). While _Then Khek Khoon_ at \[22\] posited the possibility that the court might intervene in a breach of professional conduct rules if the circumstances were special or exceptional, that is not the case here. Any breach of this rule, in my view, does not render the default judgment irregular; at worst it only entails possible professional sanctions against the solicitor.

22      **_Next_**, the plaintiff also need not have written any letter to court or attended before the duty registrar to enter default judgment.

23     The fact that the plaintiff’s solicitor attended before the duty registrar without notice to the defendant or his solicitor (despite knowing that he was represented) can understandably be of concern to the defendant. However, the entry of a default judgment is, on the part of the court, an administrative act and not a judicial act. That hearing simply involved the plaintiff’s solicitor enquiring if the request to enter default judgment had been approved. In other words, no orders were made at that hearing; and the duty registrar entertained that enquiry in an administrative capacity. Accordingly, that hearing would not affect the regularity of the judgment.

24     The fact that the plaintiff’s solicitor wrote to court without copying the defendant might have amounted to non-compliance with the State Courts Practice Directions 120A(1), which requires that all correspondence to the State Courts in connection with any pending matter must either be copied to all other parties to such matter or to their solicitors or explain why there are good reasons for not doing so. However, the consequence of that is administrative: the Registry would have had the discretion to reject or refuse to act on such correspondence (Practice Direction 120A(3)). It, too, did not affect the regularity of the judgment.

25     Both _ex parte_ attendance and correspondence might also have raised a question as to whether counsel for the plaintiff had breached r 30 of the LPPCR, which generally prohibits _ex parte_ communications with the court unless he has given each solicitor acting for another party to those proceedings a reasonable opportunity to be present or to reply. But, again, this is a rule of professional conduct and any breach of it does not affect the regularity of the judgment. These complaints are simply fodder for another forum, and again I make no finding on this matter.

26      **_Finally_**, since the plaintiff need not have written to court or have attended before the duty registrar to enter default judgment, and since the plaintiff need not hold its hands on entering default judgment simply because it is aware of a pending application to extend the time for filing a defence, it should follow that the fact that counsel for the plaintiff did not inform the court of the existence of that application does not affect the regularity of the default judgment.

#### Failure to abide by discovery obligations

##### (1)   Failure to furnish a copy of documents pursuant to a request

27     The defendant also argued was that the judgment was irregular because plaintiff had breached O 108 r 2(5), which requires the plaintiff to provide a copy of a document in the LOD within 7 days of receiving a request for such copy. According to the defendant, the consequences of the plaintiff furnishing a copy of the cheque belatedly was that counsel had insufficient time to review the documents, take instructions and file a meaningful defence, before judgment was sought to be entered on 8 Jan 2019.

28     I was unable to accept the argument in the way the defendant had framed it. For convenience, O 108 r 2 provides:

**Upfront discovery (O. 108, r. 2)**

**2.—(1**)    The purpose of this Rule is to ensure that every party has the fullest possible particulars of every other party’s case at an early stage of the proceedings, in order to facilitate effective negotiations towards a resolution of the dispute between all of the parties.

(2)    The negotiations referred to in paragraph (1) include —

(_a_)    direct negotiations between the parties themselves; and

(_b_)    negotiations facilitated by a judge or mediator, or by any other suitable person (not being a party).

(3)    Every pleading served by a party under Order 18 must be accompanied by a list of documents which are or have been in that party’s possession, custody or power.

(4)    The list of documents referred to in paragraph (3) —

(_a_)    must be filed in Form 234;

(_b_)    must set out —

(i)    every document referred to in the pleading which the list accompanies;

(ii)   every document on which the party serving the list relies or will rely; and

(iii)   any other document which could —

(A)    adversely affect that party’s own case;

(B)    adversely affect another party’s case; or

(C)    support another party’s case; and

(_c_)    must set out the documents in a convenient order and as shortly as possible, but also describe each document sufficiently to enable the document to be identified.

(5)    Where a party who has served a list of documents on any other party receives from that other party a request for a copy of any document on the list, the party who has served the list of documents must, within 7 days after receiving the request, provide that other party with a copy of that document.

(6)    If an amended pleading is filed by any party, this Rule shall apply to the amended pleading if the amended pleading —

(_a_)    pleads any additional fact; or

(_b_)    refers to any document that was not referred to in any other pleading filed by that party.

…

29     The defendant’s argument—that it was motivated by a desire to file a meaningful defence—appears attractive at first glance. However, one need only recall that the date the SOC and LOD were served was 22 November 2018, to realise that the last day for the filing of a defence would have been 14 December 2018 (by virtue of O 18 r 2(1) read with O 12 r 4(_a_)) and that, therefore, the plaintiff could have entered default judgment on 15 December 2018 (but for the fact it filed an amended SOC). On the other hand, it was only on 14 December 2018 that a copy of the cheque was first requested. This meant that the plaintiff had until 21 December 2018 to provide a copy of the cheque. In other words, the plaintiff could have entered default judgment _before_ it was obligated to provide a copy of the cheque. I somewhat doubt that the defendant was motivated by a desire to file a meaningful defence if it requested a copy of the cheque on the last day it had to file a defence. More to the point, I did not think it lay in the mouth of the defendant, having made the request late in the day, to complain that the plaintiff entered default judgment any time after having provided a copy of the cheque.

30     But, even if the defendant were to have requested a copy of the cheque earlier such that the plaintiff was obligated to provide a copy before it was entitled to enter default judgment, my analysis would not change.

31     In the first place, taking a copy of documents and entering default judgment are two independent processes. A request for a copy of any document which is (or should be) set out in the LOD, like a request for particulars, is made not by the plaintiff but by a party on whom the plaintiff’s pleadings and LOD are served. The time afforded to the plaintiff to comply with his obligation to produce a copy takes reference from the date of such request. In other words, it is perfectly possible—in fact, empirically the norm—for a default judgment to be entered without inspection or the taking of copies ever having taken place.

32     The defendant was not prevented from filing a defence because it did not have a copy of a document referred to in the cheque. It could have pleaded to the SOC as far as was reasonably possible and, if a copy of the cheque was furnished later, it could seek to amend or further particularise its defence. Alternatively, if the defendant considered that it could not plead any meaningful defence without first looking at a copy of the cheque, it could have sought an order before the duty registrar extending the time to file its defence until after the plaintiff furnished it with a copy of the cheque. This was not done.

33     If the defendant’s argument is correct, then it must mean that any unfulfilled request for a copy of documents can preclude the plaintiff from entering default judgment. In my view, such a proposition cannot be correct. No rule requires the plaintiff to have fulfilled any request for copies of documents before it may enter default judgment. A defendant who simply requests copies of documents without filing a defence, thinking that this will keep a default judgment at bay, will have to face the consequences of his misplaced assumption.

##### (2)   Failure to file a LOD in compliance with O 108 r 2

34     However, after my attention was brought to the issue of discovery generally, it appeared to me that the plaintiff did not comply with its obligation of filing the LODs in compliance with O 108 r 2.

35      **_First_**, the amended SOC (which was the pleading on which default judgment was entered) was not accompanied by an LOD. In this regard, O 108 r 2(6)(_a_)–(_b_) (when read with O 108 r 2(3)–(4)) requires that an amended SOC be accompanied by an LOD if it pleads any additional fact or refers to any document not referred to in any other pleading filed by that party. In my judgment, both criteria under O 108 r 2(6) are engaged here. The substitution of the cheque number and the name of the bank on the cheque amounted to the removal of some facts and, crucially, the addition of other facts. It also meant that the amended SOC referred to another document not referred to in the original SOC. In this regard, I was not persuaded by the plaintiff’s riposte that the LOD would not have changed because it was simply correcting an error in the SOC—the test for whether a further LOD may be dispensed with is not whether there is an error. Even if the LOD previously filed happened to be sufficient, then what is required is essentially the filing of a nil return.

36      **_Second_**, the LOD that accompanied the SOC did _not_ comply with O 108 r 2(4)(_b_)(i). An LOD must have been filed in Form 234 setting out every document referred to in the pleading which it accompanied. Form 234 contains sections addressing documents of which the plaintiff had no possession, custody or power _and_, if the plaintiff once had possession, custody or power of such documents, when that was last the case and what had become of such documents. However, the plaintiff’s LOD did _not_ refer to any cheque (whether or not the correct or wrong cheque) and was accordingly defective.

37     In my view, these two matters are additional procedural requirements that the plaintiff must meet in Magistrate’s Court actions when serving its SOC on the defendant. As these requirements were not observed, the SOC was not served in accordance with the ROC. And, since the judgment in default of defence is predicated on the SOC having been properly served, non-compliance with these two requirements renders such judgment irregular.

### What should the consequence of the irregularity be?

38     Where a judgment is irregular, the starting point is that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right (_Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 907</span> (CA) (“_Mercurine_”) at \[74\] and \[90\]–\[91\]). However, the court may depart from this rule depending on whether there has been such an egregious breach of the rules of procedural justice as to warrant the setting aside of the judgment as of right (_Mercurine_ at \[76\]). Specifically, the court should consider (among other things) (_Mercurine_ at \[76\] and \[96\]):

(a)     the nature of the irregularity, in particular, whether it consists of:

(i)       entering a default judgment prematurely; or

(ii)       failing to give the defendant proper notice of the proceedings;

(b)     whether the defendant took a fresh step in the proceedings after becoming aware of the irregular default judgment;

(c)     the blameworthiness of the respective parties (_eg_, whether there has been undue delay on the defendant’s part in making its setting-aside application);

(d)     where a judgment is irregular because of the plaintiff’s breach of procedural rules (which would be the case for the majority of irregular default judgments), whether the breach was committed in bad faith;

(e)     whether the defendant has admitted liability under the default judgment; and

(f)     whether the defendant would be unduly prejudiced if the judgment was allowed to stand.

39     If the court departs from such a rule, then it must consider whether the defendant is bound to lose, since if the defendant was bound to lose in a summary judgment application should it be brought subsequently, then the setting-aside would essentially have been in vain. Alternatively, the court must consider if it should exercise its discretion to uphold the judgment to stand subject to some variation or condition (_Mercurine_ at \[92\]–\[93\]).

40     In my view, the judgment should _not_ be set aside as a matter of right. But, neither should I allow the judgment to stand, either on the condition that the plaintiff file a LOD as complies with O 108 r 2 or with an order that the irregularity be excused.

41      **_First_**, the irregularity did not involve an egregious failure of procedural justice such as a failure to give either proper notice of the proceedings or the required time to take steps in the action. As explained above, the LOD is an additional procedural requirement for Magistrate’s Court cases, but its absence does not prevent the defendant from filing a defence (even if it does not allow the defendant to file a meaningful defence). Indeed, it appears from O 108 r 2(1)–(2) that the regime of upfront discovery is motivated more by a broader desire to facilitate negotiations and an expeditious disposal of the matter than to enable the defendant to plead. That said, this irregularity is also not as minor as a typographical error, or an error that does not engage the merits of the dispute (_eg_, an error in the interest rate or costs) and which can be cured by varying the judgment with virtually no prejudice to the defendant.

42      **_Second_**, while I was not prepared to say that the plaintiff had acted in bad faith, the plaintiff’s conduct was far from blameless.

43      **_Third_**, I accept that the defendant acted swiftly in filing the setting-aside application. It appeared to have wanted to file a defence and certainly did not admit liability under the judgment. In this regard, I note that where a defendant had not deliberately ignored the proceedings, the merits of the defence should not be scrutinised as strictly (_Awyong Shi Peng v Lim Siu Lay_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 225</span>).

44     In the final analysis, I considered this action one which the defendant should be allowed to defend if it was not bound to lose.

### Was the defendant bound to lose?

45     While I did not find any merit in the defendant’s contention that the notice of dishonour was defective in that it had referred to the wrong cheque, I thought that the defendant was not bound to lose on the two other issues that it had raised.

46     The **_first_** issue was whether the cheque, as a bill of exchange, had been delivered conditionally.

47     In this regard, a bill of exchange, while being an unconditional order to pay, may be _delivered_ conditionally; its effect is to deprive the transferee of the right to be paid on the bill. In this regard, to minimise uncertainty in the interest of commercial efficacy, the burden lies on the transferor to show strong and clear evidence that he intended to deliver the bill only conditionally (_Millennium Commodity Trading Ltd v BS Tech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 98</span> at \[67\]–\[71\] _per_ Vinodh Coomaraswamy J).

48     The defendant’s representative deposed that the defendant had delivered the cheque on the express instruction that it was not to be presented. In this regard, the plaintiff’s representative had sent an e-mail admitting that the plaintiff had been informed _not_ to encash the cheque that it had received, and asking when it could encash the cheque. The plaintiff produced no further contemporaneous documents showing when the bill could be encashed. Accordingly, I was not prepared to say that the defendant would be bound to fail on this issue.

49     The **_second_** issue was whether there was a total failure of consideration for the bill.

50     In this regard, a bill of exchange, like any contract, is not enforceable unless supported by consideration; if consideration wholly fails, then the contract created by the instrument is discharged and the acceptor is released. Again, the burden is on the defendant to show an absence of consideration (_Millennium_ at \[102\]).

51     The defendant’s representative deposed that the plaintiff was in fact not entitled to a refund under the agreement in the first place, because the defendant had been performing its obligations under the agreement and had issued the cheque only after the plaintiff had badgered the defendant into doing so and had represented that it would only be kept as security. While I thought that this argument was more properly characterised as one that there was a failure of basis for the issuing of the cheque (as understood in the context of unjust enrichment) rather than failure of consideration (in the contractual sense), I was again unable to say that the defendant’s contention was bound to fail.

## Conclusion

52     Accordingly, I ordered that the judgment be set aside and that the defendant have 14 days to file its defence.

53     I ordered that costs of this application be in the cause, as I agreed with the defendant’s twin submissions that the plaintiff should not have entered default judgment in the first place, but that the irregularity on which the judgment was set aside was not exactly one pursued by the defendant.
