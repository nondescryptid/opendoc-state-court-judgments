Damages – Assessment of damages – Personal injuries

30 December 2020 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:

1       The plaintiff is a Senior Vice President with DBS Bank Ltd. He was involved in and suffered personal injury from a motor accident on 25 June 2016, when the car he had been driving was hit from the rear by a vehicle driven by the defendant. Interlocutory judgment was entered at 100% liability in favour of the plaintiff, and the matter is now before me for an assessment of damages.

## Medical background

2       On 26 June 2016, the day after the accident, the plaintiff visited a general practitioner, Dr Clarence Yeo, and complained of back pain and left arm pain. Dr Yeo diagnosed a back contusion and an arm sprain. Dr Yeo then prescribed the plaintiff medication and three days of outpatient medical leave.[^1]

3       On 10 July 2016 and 17 July 2016, the plaintiff visited Dr Yeo again and complained of continued back pain and a sinus infection. Dr Yeo gave the plaintiff a referral to an orthopaedic surgeon, the identity of whom the plaintiff cannot remember, for a further assessment if the pain persisted. But Dr Yeo opined that the “prognosis for a full recovery is fairly good.”[^2] Neither party called Dr Yeo as a witness in these proceedings.

4       On 27 July 2016, a month after the accident, the plaintiff consulted a different[^3] orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Hee Hwan Tak.[^4] Across the four years that followed, the plaintiff consulted Dr Hee numerous times. Based on these consultations, Dr Hee produced six medical reports, the last of which is dated 19 November 2019. Dr Hee also gave expert evidence on behalf of the plaintiff in these proceedings.

5       Separately, on 5 September 2019, the plaintiff was examined by an orthopaedic specialist appointed by the defendant, Dr Kamal Bose. Based on this examination, Dr Bose produced a medical report. Dr Bose also gave expert evidence on behalf of the defendant in these proceedings.

7       With the consent of the parties, Dr Hee and Dr Bose gave their expert evidence concurrently by reference to a list of four issues that the parties had jointly produced:

>     Whether the Plaintiff’s injuries were more likely than not to have been caused / exacerbated / aggravated by the road traffic accident:

>> Neck injuries

>> Back injuries

>> …

>     Whether the Plaintiff requires continued medical treatment in the future, in particular:

>> The anterior cervical discectomy followed by re-construction with C5-6 arthroplasty and C6-7 fusion

>> Post-procedure physiotherapy and medications for 12 months

>     Whether the Plaintiff still suffers from residual disabilities, i.e. lower back pain, left arm pain and numbness and pain on the left side of his face as a result of the road traffic accident:

>> Whether the Plaintiff’s condition is likely to improve, and if so, what is the estimated period of recovery

>> Whether the Plaintiff’s ability to effectively function for activities of daily living

>     Whether the Plaintiff’s ability to effectively function at work is affected.

## Arm injury

8       As diagnosed by Dr Yeo the day after the accident, the arm injury suffered by the plaintiff was a sprain in his left arm. This was treated conservatively with medication and three days of outpatient medical leave. Since then, the plaintiff has not made any further complaints in respect of this arm sprain. In my view, this injury is minor, and the plaintiff has fully recovered from it. I thus assess damages for pain and suffering for this injury at $500.

## Spinal injury

9       The plaintiff submits that the accident caused spinal injuries in his neck (cervical spine) and back (lumbar spine). These injuries, their associated effects, and the expenses therefrom form the bulk of his claim in these proceedings. For the neck, he submits that the accident aggravated the spondylolisthesis at C4-5; caused intervertebral disc bulges at C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7 with associated bilateral exit stenosis at C5-6 and C6-7; and caused significant left nerve root lesions at the C6 and C7 vertebrae (the “Neck Conditions”). For the back, he submits that he sustained an intervertebral disc bulge at L4-5 associated with right lateral recess stenosis (the “Back Conditions”).

10     The defendant accepts that the plaintiff presently suffers from the Neck Conditions and the Back Conditions. But the defendant maintains that the accident caused only a minor back contusion, and that the Neck Conditions and the Back Conditions either pre-existed the accident or are the product of degenerative changes that occurred naturally and were not caused by the accident.

### Neck injury

11     The plaintiff submits that the Neck Conditions are caused by the accident because his neck had been asymptomatic prior to the accident and that pain in his neck emerged only after the accident.[^5] He deposed in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief to the same chronology of the emergence of pain in the neck, and added that the pain was “considerable”.[^6] He clarified in cross-examination that the pain in the neck had emerged on the very night of the accident and reported a pain score of 10/10[^7] (_ie_, the maximum).

12     Similarly, Dr Hee opined that the Neck Conditions are at least 50% due to the accident based on the premise that the symptoms with the neck had emerged “soon” after the accident.[^8] According to Dr Hee, the plaintiff “had symptoms soon after \[the\] accident” and those “symptoms did not subside despite conservative treatment”.[^9]

> Ct:    Q1 - whether neck and back injuries likely to have been caused by accident

> Hee:  Yes, more likely than not.

>> Neck -  Plaintiff had symptoms soon after accident - symptoms did not subside despite conservative treatment - follow up MRIs showed worsening at C5/C6

>> Back -  incurred at same time as neck injuries - but back injury responded reasonably well to conservative treatment and Plaintiff did not complain of neck issues

13     In my judgment, the claim by the plaintiff that the pain and other symptoms in the neck had emerged soon after the accident is not supported by the objective documentary evidence. The first contemporaneously-recorded complaint of pain in the neck (as opposed to the back) was _nine months_ after the accident, on 10 April 2017.[^10] During this nine-month period, the plaintiff had had five consultations with two different doctors: three with Dr Yeo (on 26 June, 10 July, and 17 July 2016) and two with Dr Hee (on 27 July and 5 August 2016). At no time during these five consultations was any pain in the neck personally observed by Dr Yeo or Dr Hee.

> (a)     Dr Yeo did not at any time record any pain or injury in the neck. He observed instead that the plaintiff was free of spinal tenderness and neurological deficits, and had full power of his upper limbs and blood pressure that was not abnormal.[^11] He thus prescribed the plaintiff medication and medical leave, and concluded that the plaintiff had suffered only a back contusion and a left arm sprain with a “fairly good” prognosis of a full recovery.

> (b)     Dr Hee did not on 27 July or 5 August 2016 record any pain in the neck. This was even though Dr Hee had performed a thorough clinical examination of the neck and shoulders of the plaintiff on 27 July 2016. Although the medical report produced by Dr Hee states that the plaintiff had experienced “slight neck pain” and “left arm numbness, weakness, and tingling”[^12] the day after the accident, that statement is not a finding by Dr Hee that the plaintiff had suffered such pain but is simply a record of an assertion by the plaintiff of having experienced such pain previously. During cross-examination, Dr Hee did not deny that there was “no mention of neck injury” in his initial medical report, which was produced following the 27 July and 5 August 2016 consultations.[^13] And Dr Hee had found during his clinical examination that the plaintiff had a good range of motion in the neck with no obvious neurological deficits of the upper limbs.[^14]

14     Perhaps recognising that his claim that his symptoms of neck injury had arisen contemporaneously to the accident is not supported by the objective documentary evidence, the plaintiff appears to take a different view in his closing submissions. He states there that “it must be impressed on the Court that it is common knowledge that neck injury symptoms might not arise immediately in an injured victim.”[^15] But the plaintiff has long insisted that he had from the night of the accident experienced “considerable” pain with a pain score of 10/10. Hence, I struggle to see how this submission assists the plaintiff. I set out the description of the pain in the neck offered by the plaintiff in cross-examination:[^16]

> Q:    \[Reading from Plaintiff’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\] at para 9 - after accident, I suffered considerable pain in neck, back, left arm that I did not experience prior to accident?

> A:    Yes

> Q:    When did you first experience the _neck pain_?

> A:     _The night of the accident_. Not just the neck but the entire back. A week or two after accident, I felt pain at my back.

> Q:    The pain was above the shoulder?

> A:    Yes

> Q:    One or two weeks after accident, where was the pain?

> A:    Lower back. And my arm had tingling sensations.

> Q:    On scale of 1-10, how would you describe _neck pain_?

> A:    10

>     \[Emphasis added\]

15     Although Dr Yeo had not recorded any complaint of pain in the neck, the plaintiff declined to call Dr Yeo as a witness or to even seek a clarification from Dr Yeo, on account that Dr Yeo was simply a general practitioner and was not an orthopaedic specialist.[^17] But I do not think that the recording of a complaint of neck pain is beyond the competence of a general practitioner like Dr Yeo, particularly given the acknowledgement by the plaintiff that Dr Yeo was a “good family doctor” who had seen him in the past.[^18] If the plaintiff believed that the with the opinion of Dr Yeo was incomplete, he should have sought clarification from Dr Yeo, whether in a medical report or by calling Dr Yeo as a witness in these proceedings. The parties having dispensed with the attendance of Dr Yeo, in the words of the plaintiff in his closing submissions, “\[t\]his means that \[Dr Yeo’s\] report is deemed accepted without challenge”.[^19]

16     The plaintiff testified that he wanted a specialist opinion following his consultation with Dr Yeo. Notably, Dr Yeo provided the plaintiff with a referral to an orthopaedic specialist. However, the plaintiff declined to go with the referral and sought his own specialist, eventually settling with Dr Hee. No explanation was provided by the plaintiff on why he declined the referral and sought out Dr Hee.[^20]

17     On a balance of probabilities, I thus reject any suggestion by the plaintiff had he had experienced “considerable” pain or any pain at all in the neck immediately or soon after the accident. With the claims of the plaintiff in respect of a neck injury inextricably intertwined with his chronology of how the pain in the neck developed, my rejection of that chronology suffices for me to reject the claims in respect of a neck injury. Nevertheless, I will briefly consider whether the Neck Conditions were in fact caused by the accident.

18     The Neck Conditions were revealed on a radiological scan that the plaintiff underwent on 1 August 2016 (the “2016 MRI”). The 2016 MRI was ordered by Dr Hee after the plaintiff visited him on 27 July 2016.

19     As Dr Bose testified, there were no clinical abnormalities detected by Dr Hee during his thorough clinical examination of the plaintiff on 27 July 2016, which was one month after the accident. Instead, Dr Hee found that the plaintiff had a good range of motion in the neck with no obvious neurological deficits of the arms.[^21]

>     Clinical examination of the cervical spine revealed good range of motion of the cervical spine, with respect to forward flexion, extension, lateral rotation, and lateral flexion. There were no obvious neurological deficits of the arms. Spurling, Davidson, Lhermitte, Adson, grip and release, finger escape, inverted supinator, Hoffman, Tinel, and Phallen tests were negative. Jaw jerk was normal.

>     Clinical examination of both shoulders revealed good range of motion, with respect to forward flexion, extension, external rotation, internal rotation, abduction, and adduction. Hawkins, cross adduction, and apprehension tests were negative.

20     Dr Hee was referred to this opinion of Dr Bose during cross-examination, Dr Hee accepted that the Neck Conditions were likely to have been pre-existing or degenerative, and that the plaintiff “already had degenerated neck” by the time of the 2016 MRI.[^22]

> Q:    MRI and radiological findings in 2016 showed disc bulges at C4-C7 - are these pre-existing?

> A:    Yes. Likely.

> Q:    Degenerative?

> A:    Yes. Pre-existing degenerative.

> Q:    Bilateral stenosis C5-C7 also pre-existing and degenerative?

> A:    Yes

> Q:    Plaintiff already had degenerated neck in 2016?

> A:    Yes

21     Moreover, the radiologist who performed the 2016 MRI, Dr Tony Stanley, reported that the “bone marrow signal intensity is normal” throughout the cervical spine and lumbar spine.[^23] As Dr Bose explained, such normal bone marrow signal intensity is inconsistent with the existence of a traumatic injury to the neck of a severity that could produce the Neck Conditions. Even if the impact of the accident had caused swelling in the neck, any such swelling would have been minor and would have subsided by the time of the 2016 MRI, as Dr Hee observed. The (limited) severity of such an impact is unlikely therefore to have produced the Neck Conditions.[^24]

22     It is also noteworthy that the recorded complaints by the plaintiff of pain or other issues in his neck manifested only on or around 10 April 2017, which was nine months after the accident. As Dr Bose explained, this long time-gap between the accident and the complaint of pain in the neck suggests that the pain is attributable to a cause other than the accident: cervical spondylosis and nerve root irritation.[^25] Consistent with this, the plaintiff did not take any medical leave for over a year from July 2016 and consulted Dr Hee only twice in the whole of 2017. Similarly, much of the medical expenses that appear to be in respect of the Neck Conditions were incurred only in 2018, which is well over a year from the accident. It is thus unlikely that the accident was the cause of the Neck Conditions.

23     The plaintiff highlights that Dr Bose had examined him only once while Dr Hee had treated him extensively and produced a total of six medical reports on his condition over the course of four years.[^26] The plaintiff adds that given the familiarity of Dr Hee with his condition, the evidence of Dr Hee should be preferred to that of Dr Bose. But this submission does not take the plaintiff far. In assessing the expert evidence, the court will consider not only the familiarity of the expert with the plaintiff but also the quality and cogency of the opinion of the expert in all the circumstances of the case. For the reasons above, I prefer the evidence of Dr Bose to that of Dr Hee.

24     I thus conclude that the Neck Conditions were unlikely to have been caused by the accident. I am therefore constrained to make no award for pain and suffering in respect of the neck injury claimed by the plaintiff. The other amounts sought by the plaintiff in respect of the neck injury, including amounts for future medical treatment, loss of earnings during such treatment, and loss of earning capacity, are likewise disallowed.

### Back injury

25     It is undisputed that, as diagnosed by Dr Yeo, the plaintiff suffered a back contusion in the accident and continued to experience “thoracic back muscle spasm” and continued pain in the lower back for a month after the accident. Further, as recorded by Dr Hee, the plaintiff experienced tenderness upon extension and lateral flexion of the back during the consultation on 27 July 2016.[^27] Nevertheless, the plaintiff has substantially recovered from this back injury and does not continue to complain of pain in the back, as Dr Hee testified.[^28] Dr Bose added that the back contusion should have resolved within four to six weeks without any long term medical or surgical treatment.[^29]

26     I find it likely that the plaintiff recovered relatively quickly from the back contusion that he suffered. Taking account of the effects of the back contusion that included spasms, tenderness, and a limited range of motion, and the fact that these effects persisted for some time despite medication and physiotherapy, I assess damages for pain and suffering for this injury at $3,000.

## Medical expenses

27     Given my finding that the accident did not cause the plaintiff to suffer the Neck Conditions, I am unable to make any award for future medical expenses in respect of the Neck Conditions. I am fortified in this conclusion by the testimony of Dr Hee that his recommendations as to future treatment for the neck “would be the same whether there was an underlying accident or not”.[^30] If there would be no change in the recommended future treatment even if the accident had not occurred, the accident cannot have necessitated the treatment.

28     As for the injuries to the arm and the back, the plaintiff has fully recovered from them. I do not therefore make any award for future medical expenses for them1.

29     For accrued medical expenses, the plaintiff claims $11,827.58 while the defendant submits that the award should be only $7,337.92. In my judgment, much of the $11,827.58 relates to the Neck Conditions, which I have found were unlikely to have been caused by the accident. As for the arm and back injuries, I agree with the opinion of Dr Bose that these injuries should have fully healed in around six weeks, which would give a total amount of medical expenses of the plaintiff, which would give a total amount of approximately $2,876.32. Nevertheless, given the submission of $7,337.92 of medical expenses by the defendant in his opening statement, I award accordingly.

## Transport expenses

30     A fair figure for the cost of each transportation journey is $20. Based on the medical invoices produced by the plaintiff, the plaintiff made a total of eight roundtrips for medical consultations in the eight weeks between the accident and 25 August 2016. Nevertheless, given the submission of $480 of transport expenses by the defendant in his opening statement, I award accordingly.

## Conclusion

31     I thus award the plaintiff a total of $11,317.92.

32     I will hear the parties on costs.
