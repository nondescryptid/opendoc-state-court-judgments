5       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts without qualification-

> **“The Statement of Facts**

_IN THE STATE COURTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE_

_PUBLIC PROSECUTOR v MUHAMMAD SYAFII BIN NOORMAN SHAH_

_STATEMENT OF FACTS_

> **_THE PARTIES INVOLVED_**

> _1_.     _The accused is Muhammad Syafii Bin Noorman Shah, a male Singapore Permanent Resident bearing NRIC No. …... The accused is currently 19 years old. At the material time, the accused was employed at Pizza Hut located at Plaza Singapura Shopping Centre, Orchard Road, Singapore (“Plaza Singapura”)_

> _2_.     _The victim is Tan Tiong Seng, a male Singapore citizen. He is the rightful owner of the OCBC credit card bearing number xxxxx 9544 (“Credit Card”)._

> **_POLICE REPORT_**

> _3_.     _On 4 December 2018, at about 9.12am, the victim lodged a police report on a fraudulent transaction made with his Credit Card on 7 November 2018 for a purchase of $1,299 at Challenger located at Plaza Singapura. The victim stated that he did not make the purchase at the said location and had called the bank to informed them about this._

> **_FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 1 ST CHARGE (DAC-913839-2019)_**

> _4_.     _The accused was a part-time staff at Pizza Hut located at Plaza Singapura between January 2018 to December 2018. Sometime in November 2018, the accused found the Credit Card within the vicinity of the Pizza Hut and kept it.

> _5_.     _On 7 November 2018, at about 11.39am, the accused went to the Challenger store located at Plaza Singapura to purchase an I-Phone worth $1,299. The accused presented the Credit Card to the cashier of the Challenger store (the “Cashier”), and in doing so deceived the Cashier into believing he is the rightful owner of the Credit Card. Therefore, the accused dishonestly induced the Cashier to accept the Credit Card as payment of the said I-Phone and to deliver the said IPhone._

> _6_.     _The accused then sold the phone for about $700 and used the money for his personal expenses._

> _7_.     _On 7 November 2018, the victim received an SMS stating that $1,229 was charged to the Credit Card. The victim immediately called the bank to cancel the Credit Card. The victim has incurred a loss of $1,229. The accused did make full restitution._

> _8_.     _In light of the foregoing, the accused did cheat the Cashier by presenting the Credit Card as payment for the I-Phone, and thereby dishonestly induced the Cashier to deliver the said I-Phone to the accused.

## TIC Charges

6       The accused had also admitted to two other charges to be taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. One charge was a charge under s. 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act for using a credit card belong to another person to perform a transaction. The other charge was under s. 403 of the Penal Code for dishonestly misappropriating a credit card belonging to the same victim as in the 2 proceeded charges.

## Antecedents

7       On 2 August 2016, the accused was produced in the Youth Court. He pleaded guilty to an offence of causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his duty under s. 332 of the Penal Code. He also pleaded guilty at the same time to four other offences of assisting an unlicensed money lender to commit acts of harassment. He was ordered to be detained in the Singapore Boys home for a period of 2 weeks. Upon his release from detention, the accused was also ordered to be placed on 24 months split probation from 13 December 2016 to 12 December 2018. He was made subject to probation conditions including being placed on curfew restrictions and to attend Periodic Training. On 13 December 2016, the probation order was amended by the Youth Court with the probation period extended by 3 months from 15 August 2018. He was also ordered to be placed on electronic monitoring and to attend the Violence Prevention programme. On 16 May 2017, the Youth Court again amended his probation order to require the accused to reside at the Singapore Boys Hostel for a period of 12 months.

8       On 13 December 2016, the accused was produced in the State Courts and was ordered to undergo 24 months split probation subject to conditions including curfew time restrictions and electronic monitoring. On 25 April 2017, the probation order was amended to require the accused to be admitted to the Singapore Boys Hostel from 16 May 2017 with all other conditions to remain.

## Pre-sentence Reports

#### Probation progress report

9       As the accused had re-offended while of probation, I accordingly called for a probation progress report. In her progress report dated 7 November 2019, Ms Jasmine Yee, Senior Probation Officer, stated that continuation of probation for the accused was _not recommended._

10     In particular, Ms Yee stated in her progress report that Syafii’s progress on probation “_had been poor._” It was highlighted that his numerous breaches indicated his failure to exercise consequential thinking, poor decision making “_as well as tendency to test boundaries whenever he perceived he was not being monitored_.” Ms Yee noted also that Syafii’s repeated offending behaviour also highlighted pro-criminal attitudes and his disregard for the law. Significantly, Ms Yee also noted that his continued lack of insight into his behaviour continues to be of hindrance to his rehabilitation.

11     I was mindful that the accused suffered from mild intellectual disability. In this regard, Ms Yee had stated that although Syafii has mild intellectual disability, “_his role in the offences reflected his pro-criminal thinking as evidenced by his planning.”_ Ms Yee also noted that _“Syafii has gone through community-based rehabilitation and intervention over a period of 28 months since the start of his Youth Court Probation Order on 15 Aug 2016. The persistence of his offending behaviour even towards the end of his probation period highlighted that he has failed to internalise the severity of further reoffending and exercise the skills for better self-control. In addition, Syafii’s late nights after probation also suggests the limited effectiveness of the parents’ ability to supervise and exercise control over him”._

#### RTC report

12     The RTC report stated that Syafii was in generally good physical condition. The Psychiatrist Dr Ung Eng Khean who examined Syafii also stated that apart from his mild intellectual disability, no other significant mental illness was detected. Syafii was accordingly certified fit and suitable to undergo the RTC regime.

## Prosecution Submissions

13     The Prosecution noted that the accused had re-offended while on probation. It was submitted that the accused should be sentenced to undergo reformative training (RTC).

## Mitigation

14     The accused stated that he had nothing to say. When pressed by the court, he asked that he again be placed on probation.

## The Court’s Decision

#### Sentencing considerations

15     I had to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the accused. In this case as the accused was a young offender, I had to consider which of the sentencing options of either reformative training or probation was more appropriate.

16     Reformative Training suitability (“RT report”) and Progress Reports were called for. The accused was found suitable for reformative training.

17     Probation was no longer recommended by the probation officer Ms Yee.

18     By virtue of section 9 (5) of the Probation Offenders Act, I would therefore have to re-sentence the accused for the 2016 offences of causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his duty under s. 332 of the Penal Code and also the other offences of assisting an unlicensed money lender to commit acts of harassment ‘_as if he had just been convicted_’ given that he had re-offended while on probation.

#### Sentencing considerations in relation to a young offender

19     I am mindful of the competing sentencing considerations of deterrence and rehabilitation when deciding on the appropriate sentence for the accused, a young offender, who has committed serious offences. Be that as it may, as a starting point, rehabilitation is generally the dominant sentencing consideration when deciding on an appropriate sentence for a young offender aged 21 years and below (see _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice <span class="citation">\[1998\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> at \[21\]_ and followed in _Leon Russel Francis v PP <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 651</span> at \[13\]_.

20     Further, as observed by Steven Chong JA in _Praveen s/o Krishnan v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 324</span> at \[29_, in considering whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing matrix, the court should consider whether the particular offender’s capacity for rehabilitation is demonstrably high, so that it outweighs the public policy concerns that are traditionally understood as militating against probation.

21     As such, it is trite that when sentencing a young offender, the primary sentencing consideration is rehabilitation. However, the Court must also consider whether there is a need to incorporate a sufficient element of deterrence within the overarching focus on the goal of rehabilitation. Where deterrence is necessary, RTC is the preferred sentencing option for young offenders as it incorporates a significant element of deterrence while still being rehabilitative in nature.

22     In the case of _PP v Ong Jack Hong <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 182</span>_, Menon CJ had stated at \[14\] that “….the choice between reformative training and probation is governed primarily by whether there is in the circumstances a need for a degree of deterrence within an overarching focus and emphasis on rehabilitation.… **Simply put, reformative training should ordinarily be preferred over probation if the court considers that there is a need for deterrence.”**

(Emphasis added)

23     On 9 May 2019, the accused was charged with 2 new offences which he had committed on 7 and 8 November 2018 while he was still on probation. He faced a charge of cheating under s. 420 of the Penal Code and another charge of attempted cheating. On 10 October 2019, the accused was convicted of these 2 charges, with another 2 charges that were TIC. Cheating is a serious offence punishable with imprisonment for up to 10 years or with fine or with both.

#### Whether the accused should be placed on probation for the second time

24     The Prosecution had objected to the accused being placed on probation for a second time. I am mindful that the court was not precluded from placing the accused on probation for a second time. In determining whether the accused should be considered for probation for the second time, I was mindful of the factors as laid down by Menon CJ in the case of _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz \[2015\] AGHC 277 at \[57\]_ (“Boaz”) which the court should consider on whether or not to order a second sentence of probation. These factors are as follows:

> (a)     Whether the latest offence in question is serious;

> (b)     Whether the offender’s pattern of offending, seen as a whole, significantly displaces the focus on rehabilitation or at least mandates that greater emphasis be placed on deterrence within an overarching emphasis on rehabilitation. To put it another way, the question is whether the youthful offender’s offending pattern justifies optimism or forebodes an “escalation” from the offender’s previous offences.

> (c)     Whether there is evidence of genuine remorse and a genuine commitment to repent and turn over a new leaf;

> (d)     Whether there is cause of assurance that the risk factors which caused the last attempt at probation to fail have been effectively addressed;

> (e)     Whether there are any countervailing considerations such as the public interest in prevention or deterrence that militate against a fresh order of probation.

25     Having considered the above factors as highlighted in the _Boaz_ case and in the light of the surrounding circumstances of the present case, I agreed with the probation officer’s assessment and did not think that a second term of probation would be appropriate in this case. In particular, I took into consideration and was mindful of the words of Menon CJ in the _Boaz_ appeal case where it was stated at paragraph \[50\] that –

> “………_p_**_robation should not ordinarily be awarded in cases where an offender has reoffended on probation. Reoffending while under probation will generally be regarded as a weighty and relevant consideration militating against a further probation order as it points towards the conclusion that the offender has not learnt his lesson_**_. But, as is almost always the case with sentencing, this is not an inflexible rule and the appropriate sentence must be determined after a fact-sensitive inquiry.”_

> (Emphasis added)

26     Given the accused’s young age at 19 years and therefore rehabilitation remaining as the dominant sentencing consideration, there was clearly also a need for deterrence in view of the accused’s defiance and recalcitrance in choosing to re-offend during the currency of his probation order. Furthermore, for probation to be effective, there must be parental supervision. Here, I noted that the probation officer Ms Yee, in her progress report had stated that the late nights kept by the accused, suggested the limited effectiveness of the parents’ ability to supervise and exercise control over the accused. In essence, given that probation was no longer considered to be suitable, the remaining sentencing options available were either the imposition of reformative training or a term of imprisonment.

#### Whether reformative training or imprisonment is more appropriate

27     I am mindful that imprisonment has been imposed on young offenders. However, in _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> \]_, V K Rajah JA (as he then was) recognised that this would only be appropriate in limited situations:

> “**_If the offence is so heinous and the young offender so devoid of any realistic prospect of being reformed then deterrence must form the dominant consideration_**, _and the statutorily prescribed punishment (probably imprisonment) for the offender would be the obvious choice._ **_I should add that even in such dire situations, the rehabilitation of the offender has not been cast aside_**_; indeed, the present prison environment (assuming imprisonment is ordered) does provide some form of rehabilitation as well. It is, however, not tailor-made for young offenders_ **_unlike_** **reformative training that is implemented in a special facility.”**

> \[Emphasis added\]

28     On the facts of the present case, the offences, while serious, were not so heinous as to bring general deterrence to the forefront and eliminate rehabilitation entirely. The accused himself, while clearly wayward, was only 19 years old and still retains the potential to be rehabilitated. Crucially, unlike normal imprisonment, RTC also has the added deterrence of supervision during the post-release phase which is particularly important given the accused’s hitherto unsupervised lifestyle. I was especially concerned that in view of his mild intellectual disability and the previous lack of effective supervision by his parents, it was crucial for the accused to be effectively supervised even after his release from RTC lest he re-offend again. As elaborated in Saiful Rizam at \[20\]:

> **_Trainees under reformative training are “constructively engaged”_** _during the period of incarceration, and_ **_are subject to a compulsory post-release phase where they are placed under supervision_** _and liable to be recalled if they fail to comply with the requirements imposed on them._ **_This regime involves a combined effort by the trainees’ mentors, family members and senior re-integration officers from the supervision centre to ensure a smooth reintegration of each trainee back into society.”_**

> _\[Emphasis added_\]

29     Turning to the present case, as set out in the progress report by Ms Yee, the accused has clearly made no attempt to make the most of the opportunities given to him while on probation to mend his ways. The accused’s progress report evinces a lack of insight into his actions. His social worker had to his credit, turned up in court to plead for a second chance for the accused to be placed on probation. The parents likewise had informed Ms Yee that they hoped that the accused could be given another chance on probation as they felt that he had since stayed out of trouble. I note here that the accused’s mother stayed in Malaysia and in all likelihood would not be able to exercise close control over the accused for any probation to be effective.

## Conclusion

30     In view of the above, it was clear that a more structured environment was therefore necessary to advance the twin aims of rehabilitation and deterrence, which is readily available in the form of reformative training. Further, reformative training was to be preferred over the accused’s misplaced preference for a second term of probation, in view of his young age. As stated by Menon CJ in _PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> at \[38\]:_

> “_Reformative training allows the courts to sentence the offender to a rehabilitative programme under a structured environment while avoiding the danger of exposing the young offender to the potentially unsettling influence of an adult prison environment._ **_It presupposes that the offender in question is amenable to rehabilitation_** **_within a closed and structured environment_**_such as the Reformative Training Centre.”_

> (Emphasis added)

31     Since the rehabilitative option of reformative training was available as the accused was under twenty-one years of age at the time of conviction for his fresh offences, I saw no compelling reason to favour a second term of probation or even an imprisonment term. In light of the above, I sentenced the accused in respect of both his 2016 and 2018 charges, to undergo reformative training for a minimum of 12 months detention in a reformative training centre with effect from 16 December 2019.

32     I was of the view that being a young offender, this was a fair, appropriate and proportionate sentence.

33     The accused is presently serving sentence.
