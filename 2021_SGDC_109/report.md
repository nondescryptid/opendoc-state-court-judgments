Civil procedure – Costs

14 June 2021

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

## Introduction

1       This is a supplemental judgment on the issue of costs. The full facts of the case are set out in the main judgment at _Bhuta Viral Ashok v UTI International (Singapore) Private Limited & 3 Others_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 41</span> (“Judgment”) which was delivered on 22 March 2021. The abbreviations and references used there will similarly apply in this supplemental judgment.

2       In brief, the plaintiff had made the following claims[^1]:

> (a)     against the 1st Defendant:

>> (i)       a declaration that he was wrongfully dismissed from his employment, and

>> (ii)       damages to be assessed for wrongful dismissal and/or breach of the Employment Agreement;

> (b)     against the 1st to 3rd Defendants:

>> (i)       damages, including aggravated damages, to be assessed for libel, and

>> (ii)       an injunction restraining the 1st to 3rd Defendants from publishing or causing to be published the Words, the Additional Words, or similar words defamatory of the plaintiff in any manner whatsoever; and

> (c)     against the 1st to 4th Defendants, damages to be assessed for conspiracy and malicious falsehood.

3       The plaintiff had succeeded in only his claim against the 1st Defendant for a declaration that he was wrongfully dismissed from his employment. All his other claims against the 1st Defendant as well as those against the other defendants were dismissed[^2].

4       The 1st Defendant had a counterclaim against the plaintiff for loss and damages in the sum of USD59,520.00[^3]. This was premised on the plaintiff’s breach of the Employment Agreement and/or negligence in relation to the “Phoenix Trade Incident” which was one of the findings of misconduct by the Inquiry Committee to justify the plaintiff’s dismissal. I dismissed the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim for lack of proof[^4].

5       By way of a third party action, the 3rd Defendant had claimed against the 1st and/or the 2nd Defendant an indemnity to such an extent as the court may find or give in favour of the plaintiff’s claim together with the costs of this action[^5]. I agreed with the 1st and 2nd Defendants that the 3rd Defendant had failed to satisfy the express terms of the Undertaking signed by her[^6] and dismissed the 3rd Defendant’s claim.

6       The parties had vastly diverse positions as to the appropriate costs orders that should be made following the result of the trial as outlined above.

## Plaintiff’s submissions[^7]

7       Applying the principle of costs following the event, the plaintiff submitted that he should be awarded costs in full as he had substantially prevailed in the suit. He had succeeded in his main claim on the issue of wrongful dismissal. This was the key focus of the trial which took up more than four days of the seven-day trial. On top of that, the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff for USD59,520 was fully dismissed.

8       The plaintiff further submitted that the conduct of the defendants as enumerated below justified the court exercising its discretion to order indemnity costs:

> (a)     They had unreasonably applied to strike out, amongst others, the plaintiff’s central claim that his employment was wrongfully terminated which application was dismissed in its entirety.

> (b)     They had practised selective disclosure of documents _eg_ by refusing to disclose critical documents pertaining to the DBS Deposit Deal to give the court a misleading impression of the plaintiff’s conduct.

> (c)     In their attempt to overcome the deficiencies in their case and their disclosure obligations, they had unreasonably relied on hearsay evidence from Mr Sinha, Mr Khandelwal and Mr Maleri without giving any prior notice to the plaintiff.

> (d)     They employed bullying tactics in making a spurious counterclaim for losses in the DBS Deposit Deal caused by the plaintiff without proper evidence.

> (e)     They fabricated their entire case of ‘misconduct’ against the plaintiff – each of the ‘misconduct findings’ was shown to be baseless.

> (f)     They had attempted to:

>> (i)       sneak in a belated and unpleaded point in naming the plaintiff (without any evidence) as the portfolio manager of the UTI India Debt Opportunities Fund which was reportedly a problematic fund facing ongoing proceedings with regulators in India.

>> (ii)       accuse the plaintiff at trial of sending anonymous complaints to regulators as a troublemaker, which accusation was readily refuted by the documents disclosed.

>> (iii)       belatedly in their submissions rely on the FMC Guidelines to support their misconduct finding that the plaintiff was not supposed to contact counterparties[^8] when this document had not been put to the plaintiff during cross-examination and he did not have the opportunity to address the same.

9       In comparison, the plaintiff is an ex-employee who had pursued his claims against the defendants reasonably, with the wrongful dismissal claim forming the main pillar of his case.

10     In regard to the claims in defamation and conspiracy which the plaintiff had lost, the plaintiff submitted that he should not be ordered to pay any costs. This was because the defendants had conducted their case unreasonably and/or improperly, and with a personal vendetta. Further, the facts of these claims arose out of events relating to the plaintiff’s dismissal, and as far as the conspiracy claim was concerned, this completely overlapped with the main claim.

11     As for quantum of costs, the plaintiff had submitted[^9] the sum of $85,000 (plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed if not taxed) as party-and-party costs, with a one-third uplift should the court award costs on the indemnity basis.

## Joint Defendants’ submissions[^10]

12     The Joint Defendants submitted that overall, they had succeeded in their defences to the plaintiff’s claims. Five out of the six claims made by plaintiff were dismissed. In comparison, the plaintiff had only succeeded on one of his claims, _ie_ his claim for a declaration that he had been wrongfully dismissed, and even then failing entirely in his claim for damages for wrongful dismissal and/or breach of the Employment Agreement.

13     While the 1st Defendant failed in its counterclaim against the plaintiff, it was submitted that this should not affect the overall costs award significantly because the same sub-issue in relation to the Phoenix Trade Incident had been fully ventilated in the main issue of whether the plaintiff had been wrongfully dismissed.

14     Further, the Joint Defendants urged the court to also take into account the fact that the plaintiff failed entirely in his allegation that his dismissal was a retaliation for his alleged whistleblowing action against the 2nd Defendant. As this sub-issue had occupied a substantial amount of court time, it justified an upward lift in the costs to be awarded since it could fairly be said to be an issue which had unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted the proceedings.

15     Additionally, the plaintiff had unreasonably sought to argue that he came within the definition of “employee” in the Employment Act (Cap. 91 Rev. Ed. 2009) then in force in order to render Clause 12 of the Employment Agreement “illegal, null and void”. This was an untenable position taken by the plaintiff as the evidence clearly pointed to him holding a managerial or executive position within the 1st Defendant’s organisation, and he had readily admitted during cross-examination that he had been engaged by the 1st Defendant as a professional. This issue had unreasonably protracted the proceedings as can be seen from the number of pages in the closing submissions and the Judgment required to deal with the issue.

16     The court was also informed of the Joint Defendants’ offer to settle at a mediation on 17 January 2018 by payment of $80,000 and tendering an apology to the plaintiff for the distress he suffered in exchange for a discontinuance of the suit which he had rejected. Had the plaintiff acted reasonably at the mediation, this matter might have been resolved then.

17     Considering the protracted hearings and lengthy submissions, the amount of documentation produced in the proceedings which was voluminous, the Joint Defendants initially submitted that party-and-party costs on a 100% basis should be $150,000 (inclusive of tax and disbursements). Taking into account that the plaintiff had succeeded in obtaining a declaration and that the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim was dismissed, the Joint Defendants submitted that they should be awarded 65% of the party-and-party costs on a 100% basis, _ie_ $97,500 (inclusive of tax and disbursements).

18     As for the 3rd Defendant’s claim for an indemnity, the 1st and 2nd Defendants submitted that they were entirely successful in their defence to her claim. Although the issue between the parties in the 3rd Defendant’s indemnity claim was not particularly complex, it was pointed out that the 3rd Defendant had unreasonably persisted in trying to ventilate her grievances against her former solicitors in putting forward her case. These matters were wholly irrelevant to the issue between the parties and increased the time and resources needed to respond to her case. In the circumstances, it was initially submitted that a reasonable quantum of costs to be paid by the 3rd Defendant to the 1st and 2nd Defendants should be $30,000 (inclusive of tax and disbursements).

19     In response to the court’s query whether there ought to be recognition of the fact that each of the Joint Defendants had succeeded to a different extent vis-à-vis the plaintiff’s claims for relief, the Joint Defendants then revised their submissions[^11] on the quanta of costs as follows:

> (a)     To reflect that the 1st Defendant was successful overall vis-à-vis the plaintiff, an appropriate costs order vis-à-vis the plaintiff and the 1st Defendant should be $10,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the plaintiff to the 1st Defendant.

> (b)     As the 2nd Defendant was successful in his defence to all four claims for relief made against him, the costs order vis-à-vis the plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant should be $25,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant.

> (c)     The 4th Defendant was successful in his defence to the claim for relief made by the plaintiff against him. The costs order vis-à-vis the plaintiff and the 4th Defendant should be $10,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the plaintiff to the 4th Defendant.

20     Based on the Joint Defendants’ revised submission, the total costs vis-à-vis the plaintiff and the Joint Defendants worked out to the sum of $45,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to be paid by the plaintiff to the Joint Defendants.

21     The costs for the third party action was also revised downwards from the initial submission of $30,000. As approximately three-quarters of a day was taken to ventilate the 3rd Defendant’s claim during the trial, it was submitted that a reasonable quantum of costs payable by the 3rd Defendant to the 1st and 2nd Defendants should be $9,000 (inclusive of disbursements).

## 3rd Defendant’s submissions[^12]

22     The submissions of the 3rd Defendant addressed the claims made by the plaintiff against her in defamation and conspiracy, as well as her third party action for an indemnity against the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

23     Both claims brought by the plaintiff against the 3rd Defendant have been wholly dismissed. The 3rd Defendant disclosed that over two years ago, on 12 March 2019, the 3rd Defendant had made a Calderbank offer to the plaintiff for the plaintiff to discontinue all claims between him and the 3rd Defendant. In addition, the 3rd Defendant confirmed her willingness to testify for the plaintiff in the suit. The plaintiff failed to accept the offer and proceeded to prosecute the claims against the 3rd Defendant.

24     As the outcome obtained by the plaintiff in the suit is clearly worse than the 3rd Defendant’s offer, the 3rd Defendant submitted that the plaintiff ought to pay her costs on an indemnity basis from 12 March 2019. On quantum, the 3rd Defendant sought $83,000 in party-and-party costs from the plaintiff.

25     As far as the 3rd Defendant’s claim for indemnity against the 1st and 2nd Defendants was concerned, the 3rd Defendant submitted that there should be no order as to costs:

> (a)     The 3rd Defendant had sought the 1st Defendant’s consent for privileged correspondence with the 3rd Defendant’s previous solicitors to be disclosed in these proceedings, especially in relation to how the 3rd Defendant came to change representation. However, consent was refused. This prejudiced the 3rdDefendant as it was put to her in cross-examination that she did not adduce evidence in support of various assertions when the 1st Defendant well knew that it was because of the refusal of consent that such evidence was not adduced.

> (b)     The 3rd Defendant is an individual while the 1st Defendant is a large profitable company with international business. The proceedings against the 3rd Defendant by the plaintiff was entirely due to the 3rd Defendant’s employment with the 1st Defendant under the instructions of the 2nd Defendant. The 3rd Defendant has been severely prejudiced in being out of pocket to the point of depletion of life savings for legal costs incurred in defending the proceedings brought by the plaintiff and for costs to be ordered against her in the third party proceedings would be further crippling for the 3rd Defendant.

## Applicable principles on costs

26     In dealing with the issue of costs, the court shall have regard to O 59 r 3(2), O 59 rr 6 and 6A of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). The applicable principles governing the court’s determination of costs formulated in _Re Elgindata (No. 2)_ \[1993\] 1 All ER 232 have been endorsed by our Court of Appeal in _Tullio v Maoro_ \[1994\] 2 SLR (R) 501 (“_Tullio_”), _viz_:

> (a)     costs are in the discretion of the court,

> (b)     costs shall follow the event except when it appears to the court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made,

> (c)     the general rule in (b) does not cease to apply simply because the successful party had raised issues or made allegations that failed, but he could be deprived of his costs in whole or in part where he had caused a significant increase in the length of the proceedings, and

> (d)     where the successful party raised issues or made allegations improperly or unreasonably, the court could not only deprive him of his costs but could also order him to pay the whole or part of the unsuccessful party’s costs. This fourth principle implies that a successful party who neither improperly nor unreasonably raised issues or made allegations which failed ought not to be ordered to pay any part of the successful party’s costs.

27     In cases where co-defendants are involved and they succeed in the action, the general principle appears to be that they would be entitled to only one set of costs even when they have separate representation. The court may, however, allow separate costs where reasonable grounds are shown for the severance of defences. See _Singapore Court Practice (Jeffrey Pinsler, SC, gen ed_) (LexisNexis 2017_)_ at para 59/2/6 and also _Wing Joo Leong Ginseng Hong (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v Qinghai Xinyuan Foreign Trade Co Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[201\].

28     Where a plaintiff has joined several defendants, the usual order is for the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendant eventually found not liable to him, since he must _prima facie_ be held responsible for his wrong decision to join the successful defendant in the first place: _Denis Mathew Harte v Tan Hun Hoe and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 19</span> at \[7\]. In that case, the plaintiff who succeeded in his claim against the first defendant but not the second defendant was ordered to pay costs to the latter. The Court there remarked that the plaintiff has to bear the consequence of his own choice of defendants in litigation.

29     In trial proceedings, the normal costs order should be made on an all-encompassing basis. An issue-based approach should only be adopted in unusual cases or when the raising of particular issues has unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted, or added to the costs or complexity of the proceedings: _Khng Thian Huat and Another v Riduan bin Yusof and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 1 SLR(R) 130</span> at \[21\] (“_Khng Thian Huat”_). In _Singapore Shooting Association v Singapore Rifle Association_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 266</span> (“_Singapore Shooting Association_”), the High Court further explained at \[64\] that the issues in the issue-based approach of determining costs refer to separate claims for relief and not discrete elements of a cause of action, and the successful party to whom costs are awarded is the party who has succeeded in the cause of action.

30     Finally, an order for costs on the indemnity basis is the exception rather than the norm. As highlighted in _Airtrust (Hong Kong) Ltd v PH Hydraulics & Engineering Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 103</span> (“_Airtrust_”) at \[49\], indemnity costs may be appropriate in cases where a party’s conduct fell into any of the following categories which were to be regarded as non-exhaustive:

> (a)     where the action was brought in bad faith, as a means of oppression or for other improper purposes;

> (b)     where the action was speculative, hypothetical or clearly without basis;

> (c)     where a party’s conduct in the course of proceedings was dishonest, abusive or improper; and

> (d)     where the action amounted to wasteful or duplicative litigation or was otherwise an abuse of process.

31     The High Court in _Airtrust_ at \[50\] further advocated that:

> (a)s a “baseline inquiry”, a court should ask itself whether the party’s conduct was so unreasonable as to justify indemnity costs. Such conduct had to reflect a high degree of unreasonableness, but the unreasonableness did not have to rise to the level of dishonesty or moral iniquity to attract indemnity costs. But the extent of a party’s dishonest and unscrupulous intentions and actions, where present, were relevant factors for the court to take into account

## My decision

### Separate costs orders are appropriate

32     In applying the principle of costs following the event to derive the appropriate costs orders, the court is faced with the deceptively simple question – who succeeded in this trial? The answers from the opposing parties as seen from their respective Costs Submissions are at polar opposites.

33     The Joint Defendants had helpfully tabulated the various claims made by the plaintiff against each of the defendants and also as between the 1st and 2nd Defendants vis-à-vis the 3rd Defendant in Annex A of their Further Costs Submissions. While the tabulation gives one the impression that the defendants have been overall successful vis-à-vis the plaintiff – purely as a matter of arithmetics on the number of claims which they had won – this approach has to be eschewed. As observed by the High Court in _Khng Thian Huat_ at \[21\]:

> (t)he assessment of costs ought not to be a clinical scientific exercise divorced from considerations of intuitive fairness. The court almost invariably ought to “look at all the circumstances of the case including any matters that led to the litigation”: _Ho Kon Kim v Lim Gek Kim Betsy_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 253</span> at \[12\]…

34     From the documents filed by the parties and the transcripts of the proceedings, it is undeniable that the plaintiff’s claim for wrongful dismissal which sought to challenge the findings of misconduct by the 1st Defendant’s Inquiry Committee took centre-stage at the trial. It is also undeniable that the main relief he sought was a declaration of wrongful dismissal.

35     While the plaintiff has not shown that he suffered any pecuniary loss from the Inquiry Committee’s misconduct findings made against him, as a capital markets licensed representative, he would have had to declare under the ‘fit and proper’ requirements of the MAS licensing regime applicable to his industry that he had been terminated from his employment by the 1st Defendant for misconduct. As any prospective employer would conduct due diligence checks, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to have commenced the action against his former employer in order to remove the blight on his professional records caused by the misconduct report filed with MAS.

36     In my assessment, the plaintiff has clearly succeeded in his cause of action for breach of the Employment Agreement. The primary objective of the plaintiff’s suit was to remove the stigma of him being terminated from his employment for misconduct. His objective has been achieved as he has succeeded in obtaining the declaration that he was wrongfully dismissed for misconduct. While there were matters which he raised which were unmeritorious as submitted by the Joint Defendants, the plaintiff has succeeded in his cause of action against the 1st Defendant. He has also succeeded in defeating the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim against him for breach of the Employment Agreement and/or in negligence.

37     However, the court must also recognise that the plaintiff, in addition to his cause of action against the 1st Defendant for wrongful dismissal, had made separate and distinct claims in defamation, malicious falsehood and conspiracy against the other defendants in their personal capacities. The plaintiff failed in all these other causes of action and the costs order ought to, in all fairness to these defendants, reflect this eventuality.

38     Hence, while the court recognises that an all-encompassing costs order is the norm, it is appropriate on the facts of this case and the manner in which the proceedings were conducted, to make separate costs orders as between the different parties on the basis that the successful party to whom costs are awarded is the party who has succeeded in the cause of action: _Singapore Shooting Association_. The parties (apart from the 1st Defendant) who had been joined by the plaintiff in this suit and had prevailed in their defences are entitled to party-and-party costs against him.

39     I agree with the Joint Defendants’ submission that in light of the adverse position taken by the 3rd Defendant vis-à-vis the Joint Defendants, as evidenced by the claim made by the 3rd Defendant against the 1st and 2nd Defendants, the severance of defences in this case was reasonable. As for the 2nd and 4th Defendants who were jointly represented, from the manner in which the pleadings were formulated in the conspiracy claim against them and the joint conduct of their defence, I do not think that a separate costs order in favour of the 4th Defendant is warranted.

40     Accordingly, costs orders will be made:

> (a)     as between the plaintiff and the 1st Defendant;

> (b)     as between the plaintiff and the 2nd and 4th Defendants collectively;

> (c)     as between the plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant; and

> (d)     in the third party action as between the 1st and 2nd Defendant and the 3rd Defendant.

### No indemnity costs

41     The plaintiff had argued that he should be entitled to costs on an indemnity basis for the reasons outlined at \[8\] above. I do not agree.

42     The pre-trial discovery and striking-out applications are normal incidents of our adversarial system and the court had dealt with them together with the costs of those applications (save for the routine uncontested summonses) in accordance with their merits. As listed in Annex A of PSS (Costs), the plaintiff had been awarded costs for the striking-out, discovery, extension of time and unless order applications.

43     As for the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendants had employed attrition and bullying tactics, and conducted their case with a personal vendetta, the evidence adduced at the trial and the findings of the court do not support this. In fact, as the court had found, the plaintiff’s case on whistleblowing appeared to be his personal vendetta against the 2nd Defendant.

44     Taken together, it cannot be said that the matters complained of by the plaintiff on the conduct of the litigation reflect such a high degree of unreasonableness (as explicated in _Airtrust_) to warrant the penal element of an indemnity costs order.

45     Regarding the 1st Defendant’s offer to the plaintiff of $80,000 and an apology in exchange for the discontinuance of the suit, as the plaintiff’s main concern was the misconduct report arising from his termination of employment which the 1st Defendant was not prepared to withdraw, the plaintiff’s rejection of the offer cannot be considered unreasonable in the circumstances.

46     As for the indemnity costs sought by the 3rd Defendant against the plaintiff based on a “Calderbank offer”, it is pertinent to note that the offer was purportedly made on 12 March 2019 which is a date after the deadline for exchange of AEICs between the parties. All preparatory work including his AEIC had been completed by the plaintiff as at the date of the offer whereas the 3rd Defendant had not complied with the court orders, and in fact required repeated extensions of time for her AEIC[^13] which even culminated in an unless order being made against her. The 3rd Defendant was clearly a relevant and necessary witness (being a member of the Inquiry Committee) and would have been called to testify at the trial. Her offer to testify for the plaintiff in exchange for the discontinuance of the suit against her would smack of witness gratification. It is difficult to see how the terms of her Calderbank offer would have incentivized a settlement with the plaintiff at that stage of the proceedings. I find that it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to have rejected the 3rd Defendant’s offer, and dismiss her argument that she is entitled to indemnity costs from the date it was made.

### Quantum

47     All parties had referred to Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions as a reference for the court to fix costs (“Costs Guidelines”).

48     The issues in this case concern aspects of employment law, defamation and conspiracy. I agree with the Joint Defendants’ submission that the voluminous documents disclosed, the complexity of facts placed before the court and the length of the trial justify a classification of the present dispute as one of “_Complex tort or contract_” as set out in the Costs Guidelines. I would also endorse the suggested daily tariff of $12,000 – this was undoubtedly a document-heavy trial with three volumes of the agreed bundle of documents totalling 2,286 pages, not including additional documents tendered at the trial. The plaintiff’s core bundle of documents alone spanned two volumes totalling 1338 pages. The defendants also had their separate bundles and supplementary bundles of documents. As the trial took seven days, it would be reasonable to allocate four and a halfdays to the wrongful dismissal claim, two days to the claims in defamation, malicious falsehood and conspiracy and a half day to the third party action.

49     Using the Costs Guidelines as reference, I will fix the costs payable by the parties as follows:

> (a)     For the wrongful dismissal claim and the 1st Defendant’s counterclaim, the plaintiff shall have costs of $54,000 (being $12,000 x 4.5 = $54,000). The plaintiff shall also be entitled to reasonable disbursements to account for _inter alia_ the voluminous bundles necessarily prepared for his case. Such disbursements shall be fixed by me if they cannot be agreed between the parties.

> (b)     For the claims in defamation, malicious falsehood and conspiracy, on account of the overlapping facts with the main claim, a reduction of the daily tariff would be appropriate:

>> (i)       the 2nd and 4th Defendants shall have costs of $20,000 inclusive of disbursements;

>> (ii)       the 3rd Defendant shall have costs of $15,000 inclusive of disbursements. The reduced costs to the 3rd Defendant as compared to the costs to the other two defendants is because of the overlap in the work of the defendants. This resulted in her counsel having to spend much less time in cross-examining the witnesses as can be seen in the tabulation provided by the plaintiff in Annex B of PSS (Costs). As pointed out by the plaintiff, the 3rd Defendant’s case was considerably scant in comparison to the other defendants as gauged by the level of detail in her closing submissions[^14].

> (c)     For the third party action which took up about half a day of trial, a fair amount of the costs that the 3rd Defendant is required to pay would be $6,000 inclusive of disbursements. The issue was fairly straightforward – the pleadings, AEICs and submissions were short and the issue was determined on the proper interpretation of the signed letter of undertaking.

## Conclusion

50     In conclusion, my costs orders are as follows:

> (a)     The 1st Defendant shall pay the plaintiff costs fixed at $54,000, with reasonable disbursements to be agreed if not to be fixed by the court.

> (b)     The plaintiff shall pay the 2nd and 4th Defendants costs fixed at $20,000 (inclusive of disbursements).

> (c)     The plaintiff shall pay the 3rd Defendant costs fixed at $15,000 (inclusive of disbursements).

> (d)     The 3rd Defendant shall pay the 1st and 2nd Defendants costs of her third party action fixed at $6,000 (inclusive of disbursements).
