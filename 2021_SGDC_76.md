Tort – Negligence – Causation

16 July 2021

### District Judge Dorothy F M Ling:

## Introduction[^1]

1       This is the plaintiff’s claim against the defendants for his injuries, pain and disabilities, as well as for special damages. He suffered these while he was a construction worker working at Marina Square Complex situated at Raffles Boulevard (“the worksite”).

2       The plaintiff’s case is founded on negligence and a breach of duty of the defendants as employers and/or occupiers of the worksite.

3       As causation was an issue in this case, the trial was not bifurcated for the issues of liability and quantum. However, it was my finding that the cause of the plaintiff’s injuries was not attributable to the defendants. There was therefore no necessity to go on to discuss quantum.

4       The plaintiff being dissatisfied with my decision, has raised the present appeal. I give my explanations for arriving at my decision.

## Facts

### The parties

5       The plaintiff is a Chinese national who was a construction worker in the employment of the first defendant. He came to Singapore to work in 2009 and had always worked for the first defendant. He was cross-deployed to work at the worksite.

6       The fourth defendant was the main contractor at the worksite to do the addition and alteration works (“A&A works”).

7       The A&A works included wet trade works such as plastering, screeding, skim coating, and tiling. Wet trade works was sub-contracted to the third defendant to perform.

8       To carry out the wet trade works, the third defendant engaged the second defendant as its sub-contractor to supply the labour necessary for the job.

9       Pursuant to a contract made on 1 July 2005 between the second defendant and the first defendant,[^2] the first defendant – being the plaintiff’s employer – cross-deployed him and other workers to work at the worksite. The plaintiff was therefore one of the workers who was supplied to the third defendant.

### Background to the dispute

10     On 14 April 2015, the plaintiff’s job at the worksite was to smoothen the surface of a floor slab while his co-workers prepared the cement mix. He did so by using the only tool that was provided to him: an aluminium floor screed which he stated in his affidavit to be “about 4 kilograms in weight, about 1.8 metres in length, 3cm in width and 10cm in height”.[^3] To do his assigned job, the plaintiff would be bending forward and then pulling back at the wet cement to give the surface a smooth finish.[^4]

11     According to the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 4) (“SOC”),[^5] it was about 2.30pm when the plaintiff stood up “to back away”[^6] from the area which he had just completed screeding and to move to another area to do the same, “when he suddenly felt a sharp pain to his back”[^7]. At the witness stand, the plaintiff described this more graphically when he said that when he stood up, he heard a “piaak” sound.[^8]

12     The plaintiff therefore claimed against all four defendants for his back injuries, pain and disabilities and consequential loss which included loss of future earnings and future medical expenses. He alleged breach of their duties of care owed to him.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s case

13     In the plaintiff’s said SOC,[^9] the plaintiff listed out 24 “\[p\]articulars of \[b\]reach and/or \[n\]egligence of the first and/or second\[d\]efendants and/or 3rd \[d\]efendants and/or their employees, servants and/or agents”.[^10] It was further alleged against the fourth defendant – being the main contractor at the worksite – 22 particulars of “breach of \[its\] occupier’s liability and/or statutory duty and/or by the negligence of the fourth Defendants, their employees or agents”.[^11]

14     In the plaintiff’s Opening Statement, thankfully, the scattergun-style pleadings of the defendants’ alleged collective negligence and breaches were narrowed down to the following areas:[^12]

> (a)     “failing to provide safe system of work”;

> (b)     “failure to provide a safe system of work at the worksite, by allowing the Plaintiff to constantly maintain a bending down posture and use the screed to pull back at the wet cement”;

> (c)     “failure to provide proper tools and equipment for the Plaintiff to carry out his work”; and

> (d)     “failure to properly maintain the tools provided to the Plaintiff by allowing the leftover cement to harden\[ \] and st\[i\]ck on the screed, resulting \[in\] the screed weigh\[ing\] heavier than \[its\] … actual weigh\[t\]…”.

15     Testifying for the plaintiff were –

> (a)     the plaintiff himself;

> (b)     Dr Lee Soon Tai, a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, at the Osteoporosis Clinic & Orthopaedic Surgery Pte Ltd; and

> (c)     Dr John Chen Li Tat, a Senior Consultant, Spine Service at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, SGH.

### The defendant’s case

16     It was the defendants’ case that the defendants were not negligent in any way so as to have to be responsible for the plaintiff’s injuries. Prior to his complaining of the pain, the plaintiff was not required to and did not carry anything heavy. He only used the screed which the defendants claimed was made of “lightweight aluminium”.[^13]

17     The defendants also contended that the plaintiff experienced the pain at 10am on 14 April 2015, and not 2.30pm as claimed by the plaintiff.

18     The defendants therefore jointly averred that “the \[p\]laintiff was not involved in any accident which caused or contributed to his alleged pain in the waist or injury”.[^14]

19     They further averred, and also argued in the alternative, that the alleged “pain at the waist” was caused by or contributed to by the plaintiff’s own negligence. The defendants then listed out 20 particulars of negligence on the plaintiff’s part.

20     The defendants also averred that the plaintiff’s pain at the waist was “due to his degenerative lumbar spine/ degenerative (_sic_) disk disease which pre-existed the accident”.[^15]

21     Testifying for the defendants were –

> (a)     Mr Song Xinlong, site manager of the third defendant – that is, the subcontractor at the website;

> (b)     Mr Hu Ya Bin, the foreman/supervisor of the first defendant; the first defendant being the plaintiff’s employer and the one who cross-deployed the plaintiff to the second defendant;

> (c)     Dr Larry Wu of iCare Medical and Wellness Clinic, a family physician and aesthetic doctor;

> (d)     Dr Peter Lee, a medical doctor at Orthopaedic Surgeons; and

> (e)     Mr Abdul Hadi Bin Mohamed Salleh, Principal Investigator of Ariel Protection Pte Ltd.

## Issue to be determined

22     Given that the plaintiff was suing the defendants for negligence which he alleged resulted in his back pain, the principal issue was whether the defendants were negligent. The plaintiff also had to show that the defendants’ negligence resulted in his injuries, that is, that the defendants’ negligence had a causative link to the plaintiff’s injuries. If this issue was established in the positive, the next question to examine would have been whether the plaintiff himself contributed to his own injuries.

23     As the plaintiff’s suit was against all four defendants, the burden was on the plaintiff to also show how each of the four defendants was liable for his injuries.

24     In the plaintiff’s SOC, the plaintiff made it clear that the first to third defendants were to be jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff.[^16] The fourth defendant also contributed to “\[t\]he Plaintiff’s accident”[^17] as occupiers of the worksite.[^18]

25     Further, as this case was not a bifurcated trial on liability only, the plaintiff was also expected to persuade the court on the quantum he was seeking to claim for his injuries. However, it was decided that the issue of the quantum was to be raised only after the preliminary issue of the liability was determined. Given the court’s determination that the defendants were not liable for the plaintiff’s back pain, the issue of the quantum became irrelevant.

## Issue: Whether the defendants were negligent

26     By the case authority of _Miah Rasel v 5 Way Engineering Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 235</span> at \[26\], it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove the following of each and every one of the defendants –

> (a)     that they owed the plaintiff a duty of care, that is, it is a standard of care of that of a reasonable person using ordinary care and skill;

> (b)     that they had breached this standard of care;

> (c)     that the plaintiff suffered loss; and

> (d)     that the defendants’ breach of duty was the cause of the plaintiff’s loss.

27     The burden to prove the above was, of course, on the plaintiff, and to do so on a balance of probabilities.

### The Court’s determinations

#### Plaintiff did suffer ‘loss’

28     I should state upfront that it was indisputable that the plaintiff did suffer “loss”, in the sense that he experienced a “sharp pain in \[his\] back”[^19] on 14 April 2015. Subsequent medical consultation unfolded more serious physical ailments as presented in paragraph 12 of the plaintiff’s SOC.[^20] The plaintiff claimed General Damages, and Special Damages in the form of pre-trial loss of earnings, medical expenses and transport expenses. There is therefore no quarrel that this third ingredient that was necessary to be proven in a negligence case was therefore satisfied.

#### The defendants’ duty of care

29     On the issue of the duty of care, I agreed with the plaintiff’s counsel when he submitted that the duty is non-delegable. In the case of _Chandran a/l Subbiah v Dockers Marine Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGCA 58</span> at \[17\], the Court of Appeal had even stated in unequivocal language that “it is personal and therefore non-delegable”. Regardless of the deployment arrangement therefore, an employer continues to owe a duty of care to its employees. _A fortiori_ in the present case when the plaintiff’s direct supervisor at the worksite was Hu Ya Bin[^21] who was a foreman/supervisor of the first defendant. The duty of care that the first defendant owed to the plaintiff was therefore quite clear.

30     As for the second and third defendants, the second defendant was the one who supplied labour for the works and the third defendant the subcontractor for the works. By their being in a position to control and manage the plaintiff, they stood in the position of an “employer” _vis-à-vis_ the plaintiff. In the case of _Awang bin Dollah v Shung Shing Construction & Engineering_ \[1997\] 2 SLR( R) 746, the learned judge in delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal states (at \[19\]):

>     … an “employer”… means not only the party who actually employs the employee, but _also the one who at the material time exercises or has the right to exercise control over the employee in respect of the work he was engaged to perform_, notwithstanding that there is no contract of employment between him and the party who exercises or has the right to exercise control.

(Emphasis in italics added.)

31     In their position as ‘employers’ – the definition of which is as extended by _Awang bin Dollah_’s case – I therefore further agreed with the plaintiff’s counsel that the second and third defendants owed the plaintiff a duty of care.

32     The defendant’s counsel had submitted that the claim against the second and fourth defendants should be dismissed with costs. The second defendant “only supplied labour to the third defendant and did not have control over the worksite and the activities at the Worksite”.[^22] As for the fourth defendant, they were only the main contractors there and could not be expected to micro-manage the worksite.

33     As earlier discussed, in view of the work arrangement, it is this Court’s determination that the second defendant did have control and management over the plaintiff. Like the plaintiff’s employer, since the second defendant was a labour supplier, it could decide where the plaintiff was to be deployed. In this case, it deployed the plaintiff to work at Marina Square Complex. The second defendant therefore owed the plaintiff some duty of care to ensure the safe condition of his place of deployment, for example. I considered that the extent of the control and management of the worker has a direct correlation to the duty owed to him, and so, also the extent of the liability. The extent of each defendant’s liability to the plaintiff need not be equal.

34     As for the fourth defendant, the defendant’s counsel had cited the case of _Gursahib Singh v Aquatemp Pte Ltd and 2 others_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 127</span> whereat it was held that whether the main contractor or occupier was liable for the plaintiff’s injuries that occurred on the worksite would depend on whether the injuries or accident was as a result of the condition of the site, and whether the occupier had sufficient control of what happens at the site. For example, the occupier would be liable if the occupier was in a position to eliminate danger on the site but did not do so.

35     In the present case, it would be incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that the fourth defendant had sufficient control of the worksite and the activities that went on there. I would agree with the defendants’ counsel that it could not be for the fourth defendant to micro-manage every work activity that went on there. So, did the fourth defendant do enough to fulfil its duty of care to the plaintiff? It was for the plaintiff to prove this on a balance of probabilities and to do this with some specificity. It is insufficient to hold an occupier of a site liable just because it wears the label of an occupier, even if the plaintiff was assigned to work there and so, was a lawful entrant there.

36     In the present case, there was little that the Court could go on to pin liability on the fourth defendant. If just for the fact that they did not stop the ‘dangerous’ activity, as submitted by the plaintiff’s counsel, and so they should be liable, their apportionment of liability would be minimal. Even then, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff managed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the fourth defendant had such management and control over the worksite after it subcontracted the A&A works to the third defendant.

37     The apportionment of liability can be re-visited later, if necessary.

#### Did the defendant breach the duty of care which breach of duty resulted in the plaintiff’s ‘loss’?

38     For a claim of negligence to succeed, all four elements of negligence abovestated[^23] have to be proven. Besides the ‘loss’ that the plaintiff claimed to have suffered, and even if the defendants had breached their duty of care, the question to ask was whether the defendants’ breaches resulted in the back injury that the plaintiff suffered and consequently, the pre-trial loss of income and other special damages. If this was not established, even if the defendant did commit the breaches, the plaintiff’s claims still had to be dismissed.

39     In arguing that the defendants had breached their duty of care, the plaintiff’s counsel cited the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the WSHA”) and submitted in general terms that the WSHA framework and regulations establishes the standard of duty of care between the defendants and the plaintiff. However, despite the otherwise useful overview of the WSHA,[^24] it is not clear to the Court the point the plaintiff was pressing by citing it and its Regulations when very little was submitted on its application to the claim on hand. In any case, as was also acknowledged by the plaintiff, “the mere presence of a statutory duty does not automatically give rise to a concomitant common law duty of care...” (see: _Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd v Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 360</span> at \[37\], following _Animal Concerns Research & Education Society v Tan Boon Kwee_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 146</span> at \[21\]–\[23\]; and _Tan Juay Pah v Kimly Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 2 SLR 549</span> at \[53\]).

40     The duties the plaintiff alleged the defendants to have breached could be narrowed down to two areas: (1) an unsafe system of work; and (2) use of inappropriate tools.[^25]

##### (1)   Unsafe system or method of work?

41     The plaintiff accused the defendants of not providing a safe system of work as the defendants failed to conduct a risk assessment exercise – or to conduct it properly – and that safe work procedure was absent. Plaintiff’s counsel in his Closing Submissions then delved into the Workplace Safety and Health (Risk Management) Regulations (Cap 354A, Rg 8)[^26] to explain ‘risk assessment’ and the purpose it serves. He also questioned if the plaintiff was briefed on what the safe work procedure was. To bolster the argument that there was no system of work, the plaintiff even argued that the defendant’s failure to “comprehensively investigate\[ \] and document\[ \]”[^27] the plaintiff’s injuries showed that there was no system of work. Further, that the investigation into the plaintiff’s injuries was inadequate.[^28] From this, the argument extrapolated into an inference that the defendants “lack\[ed\] … consideration for the health and safety of workers at the worksite”.[^29] Plaintiff’s counsel even highlighted that the plaintiff’s being assigned to work at the worksite breached the Ministry of Manpower’s (“MOM”) cross-deployment rules as laid out in the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 (S 569/2012) (“the EFMA Regulations”).

42     In raising the above, plaintiff’s counsel was in effect urging the Court to find that the plaintiff’s injuries could have been avoided if there was a risk assessment exercise and the plaintiff was briefed on safe work procedures. The plaintiff would not have got injured if there was a system in place to investigate into industrial accidents and there was proper documentation of the investigations. The plaintiff would not have got injured if the defendants had complied with the EFMA Regulations. Because of these breaches on the defendant’s part, the plaintiff suffered the back pain at the waist area. If there was such a magical connection between the employers’ actions and accidents, it would have been easy for MOM to totally eradicate or avoid accidents at workplaces.

43     However, whilst the Court might recognise that there were some failures on the defendants’ parts and some weaknesses in their systems, the Court was unable to see how these failures were a direct causative link to the plaintiff experiencing his back pain. In other words, it was crucial for the plaintiff to link how the failures on the defendants’ parts resulted in the plaintiff suffering his back pain. For the record, the plaintiff did attend the toolbox meeting on the morning of 14 April 2015 – the day when he heard the “piaak” sound when he straightened his back from screeding. This is evidenced by his signature on the toolbox meeting record.[^30] Although the plaintiff disputed that that was his signature,[^31] there was nothing to support the plaintiff’s contention, especially since it was only raised during the trial.

44     Plaintiff’s counsel further argued that the defendants’ method or system of work imposed on the plaintiff was such that it caused the plaintiff’s injuries as it required the plaintiff to constantly maintain a bent-down posture. The plaintiff had also claimed that he did his construction work from Monday to Saturday, from 8am to 7pm (after toolbox meeting from 7am to 8am), except Sundays.[^32] (Although the plaintiff also said that he worked two hours of overtime whenever he worked, it was unclear if the two hours were already included in the 8am to 7pm slot.) His counsel described his work hours as “arduous hours”.[^33] Hence, there was no system of work also because there was no “training and implementation of a safe system of work, which included the proper posture to adopt when performing screedings (_sic_) work”.[^34] This responsibility was imputed onto the defendants.

45     However, from the plaintiff’s own affidavit, although he deposed that most of his work was floor screeding,[^35] he had described his job scope as “varied”.[^36] He stated:

>     “Despite being a plasterer, my job scope was varied and physically strenuous. It includes plastering on the surface of wall, smoothening floor slabs using, (_sic_) carry heavy loads, mixing concrete, bricklaying, general construction work and other odd-jobs as required or assigned in the construction sites. I am required to bend down, climb scaffolds and stairs…”

46     Even if we assumed that the plaintiff had to bend down eight to ten hours a day and for a stretch of a few days, the Court’s difficulty was agreeing with the plaintiff’s counsel that this should be the responsibility of the employers, or the defendants collectively. If an accountant’s work required the accountant to peer at tiny figures for most of the day, and the accountant’s eyesight suffers, would it be the employer’s fault? Would it not be upon the worker himself to take breaks – eye breaks for the accountant, and stretch breaks for the plaintiff? For the plaintiff to undertake exercises to strengthen his back because he would want to perform well at his job? Even if the plaintiff’s work was time-sensitive to meet timelines, surely the plaintiff would know if he might be over-straining his back, and so, take quick breaks to counter the bending forwards. A worker must take care, caution and ownership of his own welfare. He cannot expect his employer to shoulder the responsibility if he chooses to be careless for or compromise on his own safety and well-being. In the present case, given the nature of the plaintiff’s job – and he had been at it since 2009 – he very well knew what it entailed. This was particularly since he was also trained and was experienced. It would therefore be reasonable to expect the plaintiff himself to self-counter the effects of his job. Besides, there was no evidence before the Court that the worker _must_ be constantly working, and constantly screeding if there was screeding to be done and if he were to take a breather, he would be punished. No, there was no such evidence before me. In fact, in plaintiff’s counsel’s opening statement, he faulted the defendants for “_allowing the Plaintiff_ to constantly maintain a bending down posture”[^37] (emphasis added). This suggested that the defendants must punish the plaintiff if he constantly maintained a bending down posture? Surely not.

47     It was also Mr Hu Ya Bin’s testimony about the screeding work that “this work is a safe easy to operate work. It does not involve high risk, it’s not dangerous and it’s one of the most common work.”[^38]

48     The above was on the assumption that the plaintiff’s work was only screeding. As earlier mentioned, the plaintiff himself said that his job was varied, and he might be required to climb scaffolds or stairs, do wall plastering, mix concrete, and other tasks. On a balance of probabilities therefore, this Court was not persuaded that the defendants’ alleged method of work for the plaintiff caused his back pain.

##### (2)   Inappropriate tools?

49     The plaintiff also argued that the tools he was given to use for the screeding was inappropriate. The plaintiff in fact suggested that there are tools that did not require the worker to bend down for stretched periods to screed a large surface area.[^39] The plaintiff then made reference to what was used in his country, China. The Court is grateful to plaintiff’s counsel for inserting a picture of such a screeding device in his Closing Submissions.[^40] From the picture, the device can be likened to a lawn-mower, with its handle up to the waist level of the person using it. The worker would push this device like a gardener would a lawn-mower. This device would have a very long simple horizontal ‘blade’ at the other end of it to smoothen the surface that it is pushed against. It is uncertain, however, if the plaintiff had this particular device in mind when he was testifying. Nevertheless, the point the plaintiff was pushing, was that there was such a device that did not require the plaintiff to squat and bend, or bend from his waist, in order to do screeding. However, this device was not provided to the plaintiff by the defendant.

50     While the Court acknowledged that there may be such a device, there was no evidence before it that such a device was available locally, or that it would be expected of the defendants to procure such a device. The standard of care expected of the employer was to act reasonably, and not extravagantly. It was not the employer’s duty of care to eradicate all danger and risks regardless or expense, but to provide to a reasonable standard. Before this court, there was nothing to suggest that the defendants could and should provide such a screeding device as what the plaintiff suggested was used in China.

51     The plaintiff’s counsel also submitted that the weight of the screed contributed to the plaintiff’s injuries. It was alleged that the screed was not well maintained. As such, the residue cement from previous works would have solidified on the screed, and so, added weight to the screed. In using such a screed, the added weight strained the back of the worker.

52     According to the plaintiff, the aluminium screed was about 4kg in itself.[^41] According to the witness for the third defendant, Mr Song Xinlong[^42] –

>     “the aluminium itself would not weigh more than 1 kg but as time goes by after work has been done, there might be some cement left on the screed. Based on my estimation, it would not weigh more than 2 kg.”

In view of the diverse testimonies on this, the court had not put much weight on this. In any case, as defendant’s counsel had observed – and the Court agreed – it was not the plaintiff’s case that the weight of the screed caused or contributed to the plaintiff’s back pain.

#### Did the plaintiff’s work aggravate his pre-existing condition?

53     The plaintiff argued that if it is the Court’s finding that the plaintiff’s screeding work resulted in the aggravation of the plaintiff’s condition, the defendants should likewise be held liable.

54     According to two doctors’ reports, the plaintiff was “lifting a heavy load from a squatting position”[^43] or “bending his back to carry heavy objects”[^44] when he suffered the back pains. These are the reports of Dr John Chen (PW3) and Dr Larry Wu (DW3) respectively. As to how the doctors came into that information, I would have to agree with the defendant’s counsel that this could only be information that was fed to the doctors by the plaintiff himself. Defendant’s counsel therefore submitted that it was ambivalent how the plaintiff got injured or suffered back pain as he seemed to have given different versions of his account.

55     However, the Court noted from the report of Dr Larry Wu (DW3) that about 12 days after the plaintiff saw Dr Wu on 15 April 2015, the plaintiff went back to Dr Wu again on 27 April 2015, and requested for Dr Wu to amend the plaintiff’s “initial presenting complaint”.[^45] The plaintiff wished for Dr Wu to alter the record that the plaintiff did not “bend his back to carry heavy objects”.[^46] Given the proximity in time between the dates of request for correction and the date of consultation, the Court was inclined to give the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt that Dr Larry Wu might have misheard the plaintiff, as was suggested by the plaintiff when he was cross-examined on this.[^47]

56     However, in the report of Dr John Chen (PW3) of the Singapore General Hospital dated 5 September 2016, Dr Chen also made reference to the plaintiff’s having lifted “a heavy load”.[^48] Dr John Chen reported that the plaintiff was “referred from the A & E Department on the 29 May 2015 when he was seen for acute back pain for one month”.[^49] Whilst it is not clear when exactly the plaintiff saw the doctors of the Singapore General Hospital, it would be post-27 April 2015, that is, the date when the plaintiff sought to correct the records with Dr Larry Wu. It was therefore clear that despite wanting to correct the record with Dr Wu, the plaintiff still repeated the same story to Dr John Chen. The cause of the plaintiff’s back pain becomes very unclear. It must be admitted that any benefit of the doubt that I was prepared to give the plaintiff was extinguished.

57     Following through with the plaintiff’s story that he was screeding when he suffered the back pain, he was also unclear what posture he had adopted before he straightened and heard the “piaak” sound. The plaintiff’s counsel suggested that given the passage of time, memory fades. Whilst that may be so, with regard to the medical reports, it must be borne in mind that these medical reports were recorded contemporaneously at the time of consultation. They would therefore be most proximate in time to the event of the plaintiff’s suffering the back pain. Yet, there is such an ‘error’ in the records?

58     It appears from the medical reports that the plaintiff has a pre-existing lumbar spondylosis condition. The plaintiff’s counsel even suggested that this stemmed from October 2009 when the plaintiff first commenced work as a construction worker at the first defendant’s company. Dr Larry Wu declined to comment on that as he did not see the plaintiff’s MRI records or even knew that the plaintiff had undergone an MRI. Dr Lee Soon Tai (PW2), however, opined that the plaintiff’s pre-existing condition was aggravated by the incident of 14 April 2015. The truth, however, was that the doctors also did not know the plaintiff’s work history or his occupations to be able to opine definitively that his injuries were attributable to the screeding work.

59     Further, from 2009 until 2015, there were no records before the Court that the plaintiff had complained of this condition. It was also suspicious if this was work-related from 2009. In any case, that would have been time-barred. In fact, it was not even an allegation that the plaintiff raised in his affidavit. This Court was also inclined to believe that the plaintiff did not just do screeding work from 2009 to 2015.

60     All taken into consideration, whilst the plaintiff might have some pre-existing condition, it is uncertain if it was related to his screeding work. There were no previous complaints. The MRI done showed up these ailments. Still, the causative link to the screeding work was suspicious on a balance of probabilities, particularly since the plaintiff never complained about it previously.

61     There was another fact which the Court could not ignore: the work records showed that on 12 and 13 April 2015, the plaintiff did not work at the worksite. There is no evidence of what the plaintiff engaged in, that might perhaps have made it ‘conducive’ for the cracking sound at his back on 14 April 2015. Whilst these might be small factors in themselves and perhaps colourless, placed together one with the other, they present a different hue to the case.

62     If this Court must answer directly the plaintiff’s question on whether the screeding work aggravated the plaintiff’s pre-existing condition,[^50] it shall have to be a “no” for the reasons aforementioned.

## Conclusion

63     It must be borne in mind that the legal burden always remained with the plaintiff to prove his case, even if the evidential burden might have shifted. Further, even if the defendant has a bad case – which was not the case here – the plaintiff still had to prove his case. (See: _Goldrich Venture Pte Ltd and another_ v _Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 103</span> at \[78\].)

64     In the present case, the defendant had thrown up sufficient doubts to displace the plaintiff’s proof of his case on a balance of probabilities.

65     Was the plaintiff’s back pain a result of his work activities of 14 April 2015? Even if it was, were the defendants negligent? Even if the defendants were negligent, did that cause the plaintiff’s back pain? Only if all three questions were answered in the affirmative on a balance of probabilities would the plaintiff have sufficiently discharged his burden of proof.

66     Flowing from the above, the Court had not found that it was able to answer all three questions even with a soft “yes”. The plaintiff’s case was therefore dismissed with costs.

67     I shall hear parties on costs.
