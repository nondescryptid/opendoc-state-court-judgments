TORT – Negligence – Damages

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 39/2021.\]

1 November 2021 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The present suits touched on a rather novel point of law. How should a court make awards for injuries or death caused to a pet dog?

## Facts

### The parties

2       On 14 March 2018 at about 5.30pm, a tragic motor accident occurred along Trevose Crescent in the direction of Dunearn Road. The defendant Soh Poh Geok, who was driving her motorcar, collided into two domestic workers known as Janet Quisora Valdez (“Janet”) and Lorena Marinas Cortez (“Lorena”). Janet and Lorena were out walking 2 pet dogs named Max (“Max”) and Ruby (“Ruby”) belonging to Madam Walker Helen Debra (“Madam Walker”) and Mr Rogers Paul (“Mr Rogers”) respectively. Both dogs were adopted by the Rogers before they moved to Singapore and brought the dogs along with them. Janet was the domestic worker employed by the Rogers and Lorena was Janet’s friend.

3       As a result of the accident, Janet and Lorena suffered personal injuries . Their claims were settled without going through trial proceedings. As their claims are not the subject matter of the 2 present suits, I shall refrain from elaborating in my grounds of decision. Instead, the present suits related to claims filed by the Rogers for the 2 pet dogs. MC 6897 of 2019 was a claim for damages for the death of Max (a rare breed of dog known as Tibetan Mastiff). MC 6901 of 2019 was a claim for damages resulting from injuries sustained by Ruby (a Labrador Retriever). The present appeal is against my award of damages for Max. Currently, there is no appeal filed for my award of damages for Ruby. Unfortunately, Mr Rogers, who owned Ruby, passed away due to an illness shortly before delivery of my decision in February 2021.

4       On the first day of trial on 7 December 2020, parties agreed to enter interlocutory judgment in which the defendant was to bear 90% liability for both suits. As these were not bifurcated trials, the assessment of damages took place 2 days later on 9 December 2020. It was a one-day assessment of damages hearing during which 3 witnesses gave evidence in court. They were Mr Chua Ming Kok (“Mr Chua”), President of the Singapore Kennel Club, Mr Gianuario Marotta (“Mr Marotta”) who was Ruby’s regular Veterinarian and Madam Walker. Mr Rogers was too critically ill to attend court and parties agreed to dispense with his court attendance.

5       After hearing all the evidence and considered the written submissions of the parties, I awarded the sums on a 100% basis of $2,700 for Max and $11,199.23 for Ruby with the usual statutory interest from date of writ to judgment. As highlighted earlier, there is only an appeal against my award for Max and I set out the grounds of my decision below. I decided to also expand the coverage of my grounds to include my award for Ruby as both suits involved a rather novel point of law as stated earlier.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

## For Max

6       In the Statement of Claim, Madam Walker claimed the sum of $10,680 or alternatively, damages for her damages, loss and expense arising from the death of Max which died on the spot. She particularised her special damages as $600 for cremation/burial costs and $10,000 as value of Max.

7       The plaintiff[^1] took the position that she was entitled to claim for costs of acquiring a replacement for Max and for cremation expenses to dispose of the dog’s remains. The plaintiff submitted that the normal measure of damages where chattels had been destroyed was the cost of replacement representing the market value of the chattels destroyed as the plaintiff was to be restored to the position she was in before the loss occurred. Costs of disposal of a “large 50 kg carcass of dead weight” was recoverable as a consequential loss. Reasonable cost of proper and legal disposal was therefore recoverable on basic principles.

8       The plaintiff also stated that owners are required by law to dispose of dead pets[^2]. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to claim the costs of such disposal. Further, the amount claimed was not challenged by the defendant as being extravagant or unreasonable. The plaintiff disputed the defendant’s position that death was inevitable as irrelevant. The plaintiff also disputed the defendant’s position that as Madam Walker had testified in court that she was not acquiring replacement pet dogs, no damages ought to be awarded to her. As Mr Chua had given evidence that there was no meaningful market for an adult Tibetan mastiff, the next best valuation was the cost of a Tibetan Mastiff puppy and doing so did not lead to betterment. No discount should therefore be accorded for the costs of replacement pet dogs.

## For Ruby

9       As for Ruby, in the Statement of Claim, Mr Rogers claimed for damages, loss and expense resulting from injuries suffered by Ruby. The injuries were particularised in the Statement of Claim as a severely fractured hip that required surgical intervention. Ruby continued to suffer from significant disabilities such as (but not limited) to weakness and pain in the hip, lameness and difficulty in standing up, walking long distances or running or jumping.

10     In terms of quantification of the plaintiff’s claim[^3], it was $11,219.23 for veterinary expenses prior to trial (“VE”) and $47,964.64 for future veterinary and rehabilitation services (“FVE”). This added up to a total of $59,183.87.

11     The plaintiff’s position[^4] was that the relevant principle applicable was for the plaintiff to be restored to the position he was in before the loss occurred. Not all chattels were to be treated alike when the proper measure of damages was to be determined. Inanimate objects could assume a unique status especially in this instance involving companion animal of 11 years standing in the family. The plaintiff submitted that Ruby’s life expectancy was 15 years so at 11 years, she was two thirds of the way to her life expectancy.

12     The plaintiff also submitted that under section 41C(1)(d) of the Animals and Birds Act (Cap 7, Rev Ed 2002)[^5], the owner has the duty to take reasonable steps to ensure the animal is cared for in accordance with the codes of animal welfare applicable to the animal. Ruby was not a candidate for euthanasia and treatment was recommended to alleviate its suffering. The plaintiff submitted that there was no betterment in this instance by seeking the replacement dog cost. The defendant’s suggestion that a dog’s value did depreciate over time was an unsustainable one.

13     The plaintiff[^6] disputed the defendant’s position that Ruby as a chattel should be a total constructive loss. Not all chattels were to be treated in the same manner and the defendant’s proposition for doing so was one that was not grounded in law nor logic. The plaintiff emphasized that the Veterinarians had recommended treatment for Ruby and reminded that the plaintiff’s claim had not been challenged as one that was unreasonable or extravagant.

### The defendants’ version

## For Max

14     The defendant’s position[^7] was that the plaintiff was not entitled to claim for the cost of cremation as Max would have been cremated upon reaching his natural lifespan and the plaintiff would have ordinarily borne the cost of cremation. Therefore, there was no loss. In addition, there was no legal basis to award cost of cremation. Section 10(3)(c) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, Rev Ed 1999) allows the estate of a person to claim for funeral expenses if death is caused by a tortious act. However, this provision did not apply to the death of a dog.

15     As Madam Walker had testified in court that she did not intend to get a replacement dog for Max, the pleaded cost of replacement should not be allowed. Even if the cost of replacement was to be allowed, the price of a new Tibetan Mastiff was significantly lower than $10,000. If the court were to award costs of replacement as price of a puppy, the plaintiff would be placed in a better position. Hence, the costs of adoption of Max would be an appropriate indication.

16     In support of the defendant’s contention[^8], the court was referred to _Butterworths Common Law Series, The Law of Damages_ (LexisNexis, 1st Edition, 2003) where at paragraphs 14.15 and 14.16, on proof of a destruction of a chattel, the owner is prima facie entitled to damages reflecting the market value of the chattel. The “replacement” measure is not available as of right. If the claimant seeks to reply on “replacement” measure of recovery, he must fulfil two criteria:

> (a)     First, he must genuinely intend to renew: absent such an intent, there is no reason to give him anything more than the market value of what he has lost; and

> (b)     Second, the decision to reinstate is subject to a test of reasonableness.

17     Although Madam Walker had testified that she wanted compensation for pain and suffering caused to her family and Max, she did reiterate that she would not be buying another dog. Such a claim had not been pleaded. However, should the court be minded to award cost of replacement, then the court should take into consideration the fact that Mr Chua had testified that the cost of a Tibetan Mastiff puppy was $8,000. Awarding this amount would lead to betterment as Mr Chua also testified that the desirability of a mature dog is lower than that of a puppy’s desirability. To account for this, it would be logical to deduct two-thirds off the value of a new Tibetan Mastiff when calculating the depreciation amount of a 4 years old dog.

18     The defendant went on to submit in detail how the replacement cost of Max was $2,700. Reference[^9] was made to _The Baltic Surveyor_ \[2002\] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 623 where the English Court of Appeal endorsed Colman J’s method of calculation of damages for a sunken pontoon as taking the likely lifespan of the replacement chattel and then award the proportion of its cost represented by the would-be useful life of the item replaced. Applying to this methodology to the present case, taking the average lifespan of a Tibetan Mastiff as 12 years, the replacement cost awarded based on linear depreciation should be $5,350 (rounded up). As the initial amount used in this computation was $8,000 (which was the cost of a puppy), given that Max was 4 years old dog, with a two-third reduction applied, the value of a replacement dog would be $2,666.67 rounded up to $2,700. The defendant also pointed out that Madam Walker was unable to quantify the costs of her adoption of Max.

## For Ruby

19     Briefly, the nature of the plaintiff’s claim[^10] was that of damage to property and the plaintiff’s claim for VE and FVE amounting to $$59,183.87 exceeds the cost of replacement of Ruby. The concept of Constructive Total Loss (“CTL”) applied to the present claim.

20     In _Wang Sam Lin v Burridge Steven Harold_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGHC 252</span> (“_Wang Sam Lin_”), the High Court considered the defendant’s trespass to the plaintiff’s racehorse as the action of trespass to goods. At \[21\] of the High Court decision, a passage from _Clerk & Lindsell on Torts_ (19th Edition) was cited. Hence, dogs are chattels.

21     There were two methods to assess Ruby’s value. The first method was using the original cost less depreciation. According to Mr Chua, a Labrador Retriever puppy could be acquired for $12,000. Mr Chua opined that Ruby was 9 years old at time of accident and there was no market for a 9 years old Labrador Retriever. In such a situation, _Butterworths Common Law Series, The Law of Damages_ (LexisNexis, 1st Edition 2003) at paragraph 14.10:

> “\[W\]here there is otherwise no meaningful market value, the court must attempt as best it can to value what was lost or rather determinate what it was worth to the claimant. For these purposes, the admissible evidence ranges widely. Courts have taken into account original cost less depreciation, evidence of earnings (in the case of a chattel such as a ship), insurance appraisals, bona fide offers, sales of similar chattels or agreed resale prices.”

22     Applying this to the present case, the defendant submitted that the original cost of a new Labrador Retriever puppy less depreciation would be an appropriate way to assess Ruby’s value. Using a straight-line depreciation to Ruby, Ruby’s value would be $3,700 (rounded up) as the computation was $12,000x 4/13=$3,692.31. However, the defendant submitted that there was a second method which may be more appropriate method, that is, to use the method outlined for Max. This meant using the cost of a puppy and applying two-thirds deduction due to age of the dog (although Ruby was much older than Max), the amount came up to $4,000 ($12,000x1/3=$4,000). Both methods resulted in amounts that were fairly close, that is $3,700 using the first method and $4,000 using the second method.

23     The court ought not to award VE and FVE as these expenses far exceeded the cost of replacing Ruby. Ruby was not “one of a kind” that justified departure from the principle governing CTL. For this exception of “one of a kind” to apply, if the chattel in question was the apple of its owner’s eye and had through special work done to it to become a unique article rendering the market value irrelevant, the cost of repair in excess of its replacement value could be awarded. Here, Ruby was not one of a kind as Mr Chua had testified that this breed of dog was more common that a Tibetan Mastiff and more likely to be more readily available for adoption. It was acknowledged that there was a dearth of local authorities governing award of veterinary expenses.

## Issues to be determined

## Issue 1: Is a pet dog a chattel?

24     This is a legal issue as to whether a dog is a chattel. From the written submissions filed by parties, it appeared that both parties were in agreement that a dog is a chattel. I agreed with this position and found that a dog is a chattel. In this regard, I was bound by the High Court authority of _Wang Sam Lin_.

25     This finding that a dog is a chattel was also in line with the approach taken by most foreign jurisdictions. It followed that the damages to be awarded by this court would be based on this finding that a dog is a chattel or personal property of its owner.

26     As a dog is a chattel, I based my awards on the market value of the dogs as opposed to the dogs’ actual value according to their owners. In this respect, I agreed with the defendant’s submissions which I had outlined at paragraph 16 above that the owner of the chattel is entitled to damages relecting the market value of the chattel and not cost of replacement as Madam Walker had testified that she did not intend to acquire replacement pet dogs. I understood from Madam Walker’s testimony in court that she sought compensation for pain and suffering caused to her family for what happened to the dogs. I did not allow this claim for compensation for pain and suffering because firstly, as rightly pointed out by the defendant, this was not the plaintiffs’ pleaded case. Secondly, as I had applied the market value approach to the subject claims relating to chattels, there should not be an award for the emotional suffering of the owners due to the death or injury caused to the dogs or loss of companionship the dogs had provided to the owners. Hence, I held the view that there was no subjective element to be applied in the quantification of chattels like dogs.

## Issue 2: What are the damages to be awarded for the two pet dogs?

27     This issue is a novel one for which there appears to be a dearth of local authorities. I had applied market value approach in quantifying the award for the dogs. To my mind, this approach entails awarding damages based on the dogs’ pedigree, purchase price, general health and unique traits prior to their death or injury. Evidence on these factors had been presented to this court in the assessment of damages hearing.

28     As stated earlier, I noted that the plaintiffs had not made controversial claims in their pleadings such as loss of companionship/intrinsic value of the dogs or sentimental value of the dogs or pain and suffering of dog owners for loss or injury to the dogs. I also noted that the plaintiffs had also not claimed for punitive damages as this was a case of negligence without elements of malice, wilful or recklessness on the part of the defendant. As it is trite that the plaintiffs were bound by what is pleaded, I confined my decision to assessing cremation cost and loss of value for Max. As for Ruby, my decision was confined to assessing the loss of value and VE and FVE.

29     Before I turn to the specific awards for both dogs, I shall proceed to outline some salient details. Max was a 4 years old Tibetan Mastiff, a relatively rare breed of dog that was killed in the accident. Ruby is a 12 years old Labrador Retriever, a more common breed which was injured badly as a result of the accident. According to the report given by the Veterinarian Dr Priya Streram[^11], Ruby continued to suffer moderate muscle loss in her hindlimbs, muscular pain in the paraspinal muscles from the thoracic to the lumbosacral region, moderate orthopaedic pain and stiffness in the left hip and soft tissue stiffness in the biceps and triceps of the right forelimb.

30     Madam Walker’s evidence in court was that she would not replace both dogs as they were family pets. I was persuaded by the defendant’s submission that in _Butterworths Common Law Series, The Law of Damages_ (LexisNexis, 1st Edition, 2003) at paragraphs 14.15 and 14.16, on proof of a destruction of a chattel, the owner was prima facie entitled to damages reflecting the market value of the chattel. As the “replacement” measure was not available as of right, the claimant must show that she genuinely intended to renew/replace the chattel. Here, I found that based on Madam Walker’s evidence, this had not been satisfied as she had stated that she had no intention to replace the dogs. It followed that I was unable to award replacement costs for both dogs, that is, the cost of purchasing a replacement dog plus other related costs such as cost of immunization, cost of neutering the dog and cost of dog training. Hence, I found that I would award damages based on the market value of the dogs prior to the accident.

31     According to Madam Walker who gave evidence on 9 December 2020, both dogs were adopted. I found that at the time of the accident on 14 March 2018, Ruby was almost 10 years old and Max was approximately 4 years old. I noted that in the Animal Infirmary Pte Ltd Bill 1/68305 dated 14 March 2018[^12], the age of Ruby was stated as 9 years and 10 months which meant that Ruby was nearly 10 years old at time of the accident. Therefore, I found that I should use 10 years old as the basis for calculation of damages payable for Ruby. It was undisputed that both dogs were adopted. It was unchallenged in court that both plaintiffs had made donations equivalent to their market value to the adoption centres. But Madam Walker was unable to recall the exact amount of donations for both dogs although the sums were along the value of more than $2,000. Therefore, I placed reliance on the evidence of Mr Chua to quantify the market value of the dogs.

32     The novelty in the present suits was how this court was to quantify the market value of the dogs. I shall now address this issue of quantification.

## Market value approach in quantification of damages for the dogs

33     In brief, I applied a relatively straightforward formula whereby I took the cost of a puppy of that breed less depreciation to derive the market value of the dog at the time of accident. The difficulty was in how the depreciation was to be calculated. I relied on the evidence of Mr Chua on the market value of a puppy for each breed of dogs as well as the expected lifespan of that breed of dog as a starting point. From there, I applied a depreciation formula.

34     The depreciation formula that I applied was as follows:

> a.     For dogs with half or more of their lifespan remaining at the time of the accident, I applied a two-thirds depreciation discount to the market value of the puppy for that breed of dog. This applied to Max which was around 4 years old when he was killed and he had more than half of his lifespan remaining for a Tibetan Mastiff as the life span of this breed was 12 years.

> b.     For dogs with less than half of their lifespan remaining at the time of the accident, following from a, I applied an equal yearly depreciation discount to the remaining one third value of the puppy for that breed of dog. This applied to Ruby which was around 10 years old. According to Mr Chua, Labrador Retrievers have 12 to 14 years lifespan and I used 13 years as the average lifespan.

## Award for Max

35     In Mr Chua’s AEIC affirmed on 7 April 2020 at paragraph 3, he clearly stated $8,000 as the cost of importing a similar dog from Hong Kong as there were no known local breeders.

36     I noted that Max was not a puppy and was 4 years old at the time of the accident and a Tibetan Mastiff puppy was worth $8,000 according to Mr Chua. I agreed with the defendant that the value of Max should be quantified as $2,700. However, my quantification methodology had slight differences from the one proposed in the defendant’s submissions.

37     As it was undisputed that a puppy was worth more than a mature dog, I found it reasonable and fair to factor in a two-thirds depreciation discount from the price of a puppy in computing the value of Max. Some chattels like motor cars depreciate more in the initial years as compared to the later years. I found it reasonable to factor in higher depreciation in the initial years as mature dogs are less desirable and the likelihood of illnesses or injuries becomes higher in the later years. Therefore, I found that the market value of Max was $2,700 (rounded up) taking into account that Max was 4 years old at the time of the accident. The computation was $8,000 – 2/3 x $8,000 = $2,667 or $2,700 (rounded up). To reiterate, I found that it would not be appropriate to award replacement cost as Madam Walker had testified that she did not intend to replace the dogs.

38     I agreed with the defendant’s written submissions that death was a certainty and as such, there was no legal basis for awarding the cost of the cremation. Section 10(3)(c) of the Civil Law Act specifically provides for funeral expenses for humans. Having found that a dog is a chattel, this provision of the Civil Law Act clearly did not apply. Hence, no award was made for cost of cremation of Max for $680.

39     The plaintiff pointed out that a dog owner is required by law to dispose of the dead animal and therefore, this court should make such an award. I found this argument unmeritorious as this did not detract from the fact that death was a certainty and the cost of disposal of the dead dog would be eventually borne by the dog’s owner regardless of whether Max had been killed in the accident. As I did not award the plaintiff the cost of a replacement dog for reasons as outlined above, the parties’ arguments on betterment was therefore irrelevant.

## Award for Ruby

40     As pleaded in the Statement of Claim and further evidenced at paragraph 15 of Mr Rogers’ AEIC affirmed on 2 April 2020, he made two categories of claims. These were firstly, reimbursement of Ruby’s expenses incurred prior to trial which was a sum of $11,219.23 (“VE”) and secondly, the cost of her future medical care at $47,964.64 (“FVE”).

41     According to Mr Chua, he stated at paragraph 3 of his AEIC that a Labrador Retriever puppy had to be imported from Australia as there were no local breeders and the cost was $12,000. In addition, there was no market for a 11 years old Labrador Retriever. Mr Chua testified that a Labrador’s life span is 12 to 14 years old. Unlike Max which was 4 years old (lifespan of Tibetan Mastiff being 12 years so Max had 8 years left), Ruby was far more advanced in age that she was about 10 years old at time of the accident (3 years of lifespan left). In this instance, it would not be reasonable to use the two-thirds depreciation discount methodology which I had used for Max.

42     As Ruby was an old dog with 3 years of her life span left, it was reasonable for the court to find that there is little residual value. For mature dogs which are in their second half of their lifespan, I found it reasonable and fair to divide the final one third value by the number of life span years remaining. In this instance, the remaining one third value is $4,000 ($12,000 divided by 3). Using 13 years as the lifespan, the mid-point would be 7.5 years. This meant the annual depreciation for a dog past its mid-point in lifespan would be $533 per year ($4,000 divided by 7.5 years). Hence, for Ruby which was 10 years old, her depreciation was quantified as $8,000 (like Max, two-thirds depreciation discount up to 7.5 years of age as the mid-point of her lifespan) plus $1,332.50 ($533 x 2.5 years). This gave a total of $9,332.50 as the depreciation value. The value of Ruby was therefore $2,667.50 or $2,700 (rounded up). In summary, the computation for value of Ruby was $12,000 (value of a puppy of that breed) minus $9,332.50 (depreciation discount).

43     I set out the mathematical illustration of the computation of value of Ruby below:

> Ruby is 10 years old (7.5 years as the mid-point in life span plus 2.5 years) and has a life span of 13 years. The annual depreciation of the second half of her life is $4,000 (one-third value left) divided by the remaining 7.5 years, that is, $533 per year. A new puppy costs $12,000.

Value of Ruby is cost of new puppy minus depreciation value, that is, $12,000-$9,332.50=$2,667.50 or $2,700 (rounded up).

44     Although the formula used for Ruby as stated above might appear to be complex, I found that I would arrive at a very similar result if I had used a straight-line depreciation method as she was nearing her lifespan in comparison to Max. Taking 13 years and using a straight-line depreciation of 10 years, the market value of Ruby would be approximately $ 2,700. This meant dividing $12,000 by 13 years to obtain the yearly depreciation value of $923 per year. For 10 years’ worth of depreciation, her value would have depreciated by $9,230. Her residual value was therefore $12,000-$9,230= $ 2,769 which was very close to the value derived using the earlier formula at $2,700. Hence, I awarded the sum of $2,700 as value of Ruby. In summary, for mature dogs like Ruby, both methods/formulae produced very similar results and could be used to compute the value of a mature dog.

45     I shall now deal with the cost of Ruby’s treatment and transportation costs (“VE”) that had been incurred already.

46     I noted from the defendant’s written submissions that no award should be made for Ruby’s expenses although the defendant had submitted that there were two foreign jurisdiction cases in which such awards were made. I recognized that the Canadian and Australian cases were not binding on me. I also noted the plaintiff’s written submissions that section 41C(1)(d) of the Animal & Birds Act imposes a duty on the owner to take reasonable steps to ensure that the animal is cared for in accordance with the codes of animal welfare applicable to the animal.

47     In view of the cases and local statute that imposes duty on the animal owner to take care of the animal’s welfare, I found that it would be fair for this court to award this amount. Prima facie, it would appear to be unreasonable to make this award as it exceeded the market value of Ruby. However, my view was that these were foreseeable consequential damages arising from the injury, that is, expenditure of funds that would not have been incurred but for the injury sustained as a result of the accident and these were expenses directly related to the injury. In the context of this case, this would be the veterinarian bills including transportation costs, if any. It was foreseeable that professional care was needed to care for Ruby. I found that there was no evidence that the charges for the services rendered by the Veterinarians were excessive nor was there evidence that such services that had been rendered were not medically inappropriate. As rightly pointed out by the plaintiff, the defendant had not challenged the cost of veterinary and related expenses incurred as unnecessary, unreasonable or extravagant.

48     I noted that cost of the receipts produced[^13] totalled $8,499.23 and not $11,219.23 as stated by Mr Rogers. Being special damages, this amount had to be specifically proven by production of receipts. Therefore, I awarded the sum of $8,499.23 as special damages that had been specifically proven.

49     I made no award for Ruby’s FVE. The cost of FVE was $47,964.64 as tabulated in paragraph 15 of Mr Paul Rogers’ AEIC. In view of the advanced age of Ruby, it did not make economic sense for Ruby to obtain future medical care that far exceeded her value. Hence, I made no award for Ruby’s FVE.

50     In summary, the total award for Ruby was $11,199.23 being the addition of $2,700 as value of the dog and $8,499.23 as the VE.

## Conclusion

51     For the above reasons, I made the awards in favour of the plaintiffs as stated earlier. After hearing parties on their submissions relating to costs and disbursements, I fixed the costs and disbursements accordingly to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs.
