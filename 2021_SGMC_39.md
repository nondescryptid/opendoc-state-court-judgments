Civil Procedure – Judgments and orders – Setting aside regular default judgments

16 June 2021

### Deputy Registrar Liu Zeming:

1       This is the Defendant’s application to set aside judgment entered in default of defence on 17 December 2020. The oral arguments took place before me on 25 March 2021, at the end of which I reserved my decision. On 8 April 2021, I gave my decision with brief oral grounds. I now set out the written grounds of my decision.

## Brief Procedural Background

2       On 5 November 2020, the Plaintiff commenced these proceedings against the Defendant, claiming the sum of $30,000. Service of process was effected and the Defendant entered an appearance on 16 November 2020.

3       Despite having entered an appearance, the Defendant did not file any defence. On 1 December 2020, the Plaintiff’s solicitors gave the Defendant’s former solicitors two working days’ notice of the Plaintiff’s intention to apply for default judgment against the Defendant. Despite this, no defence was filed. On 17 December 2020, the Plaintiff requested for judgment to be entered in default of defence. The default judgment was granted on the same day (“**Default Judgment**”).

4       Shortly after the Default Judgment was entered, the Plaintiff commenced execution proceedings and a writ of seizure and sale was issued on 21 January 2021. As at the date of the hearing of this application, the writ of seizure and sale has not yet been executed.

5       On 2 February 2021, the Defendant’s current solicitors were appointed. This present application to set aside the Default Judgment (“**Application**”) was filed on the same day.

## Parties’ Respective Case

6       The Plaintiff’s claim in this action is straight-forward – it is for payment of $30,000 under a settlement agreement dated 25 August 2020[^1] (“**Settlement Agreement**”) and, alternatively, on an dishonoured cheque issued by the Defendant (“**Cheque**”) for the same amount.[^2] Copies of the Settlement Agreement and the dishonoured Cheque were exhibited in the Plaintiff’s affidavit in this Application[^3], and the Defendant did not file any affidavit in response.

7       In fact, the Defendant does not dispute that:

> (a)     there was a Settlement Agreement between the parties;

> (b)     it issued a cheque for $30,000 to the Plaintiff pursuant to the Settlement Agreement;[^4] and

> (c)     the Cheque was dishonoured upon presentation.[^5]

8       The Defendant, however, said that the “_the cheque for the sum of S$30,000 was issued to_ \[the Plaintiff\] _as a refund of his purchase of GTB coins_”[^6] and was issued “_on the basis that the Plaintiff was to return all the GTB in his possession to the Defendant_”[^7] (“**Alleged Refund Arrangement**”). As the Plaintiff never returned any “_GTB coin_” to the Defendant, the Plaintiff was not entitled to the $30,000 “_refund_”.[^8]

9       As for the reason for the delay in making this application, the Defendant explained that this was because its directors were “_initially unable to agree on the course of action to take_”.[^9] No explanation was given as to why there was a default in the filing of defence in the first place.

## The Law

10     There is no dispute between the parties that the Default Judgment was a regular one[^10] and the law for setting aside a regular default judgment is clear. The primary consideration is whether the defendant can show a _prima facie_ defence that raises triable or arguable issues: see _Mercurine Pte Ltd v Canberra Development Pte Ltd_ (“**_Mercurine_**”) <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 907</span> at \[60\]. This is not intended to be a high threshold – it is no stricter than that for obtaining leave to defend in an application for summary judgment under O 14 of the Rules of Court (an “**O 14 application**”): see _Mercurine_ at \[60\].

11     That being said, two additional points must be kept in mind.

12     First, the burden lies on the defendant to “_produce to the Court evidence that he has a prima facie defence_”: see _Evans v Bertlam_ <span class="citation">\[1937\] AC 473</span> at 480, cited with approval in _Mercurine_ at \[64\]. In this regard, it is trite that bare assertions on their own are insufficient to raise a triable issue: see _Prosperous Credit Pte Ltd v Gen Hwa Franchise International Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 53</span> at \[14\]. In the context of O 14 applications, a court will not generally grant leave to defend if all the defendant provides is a mere assertion, contained in an affidavit, of a given situation which forms the basis of his defence: see _M2B World Asia Pacific Pte Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 325</span> at \[19\]. The court is not bound to, and in fact should not, accept the defendant’s sworn evidence _uncritically_. If the sworn evidence is ambiguous, imprecise, inconsistent with contemporaneous documents or inherently improbable, then it may well be that an arguable or triable issue has not been raised despite the sworn evidence. This is so even if the court is not embarking on a detailed examination of the merits at this stage.

13     Second, although the existence of a _prima facie_ defence is a highly significant consideration, it does not mean that a defendant who is able to demonstrate a _prima facie_ defence has an _automatic_ entitlement to have the default judgment set aside. Other factors should also be taken into consideration: _Mercurine at_ \[98\]. Commonly, these include the length of delay in making the application, the explanation given for the delay, why the default occurred and any prejudice that would be caused to the plaintiff or to third parties if the default judgment were to be set aside.

## My Decision

14     For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the Default Judgment should _not_ be set aside.

### Has the Defendant Shown a Prima Facie Defence?

#### The Factual Basis of the Putative Defence

15     As explained at \[8\] above, the main thrust of the Defendant’s case, and the entire factual basis for its purported defence, was the Alleged Refund Arrangement.

16     However, on such a critical issue, the Defendant provided nothing more than bare assertions made in its affidavit. The relevant parts of the affidavit are reproduced below:

> 6.    \[T\]he Plaintiff had failed to reveal that the **cheque for the sum of S$30,000.00 was issued to him as a refund of his purchase of GTB coins** (“GTB”).

> 7.    Thus, the **cheque was issued only on the basis that the Plaintiff was to return all the GTB in his possession** to the Defendant.

> 8.    As the Plaintiff is well aware, the Plaintiff has, to date, failed to return all the GTB in his possession to the Defendant.

> 9.    The **claimed sum of S$30,000 in question is therefore in dispute as the Plaintiff failed to perform the requisite steps for the refund arrangement**.

> 10.    Pursuant to the above, we were under the impression that the arrangement with the Plaintiff was sufficiently clear and that the lack of performance on the Plaintiff’s part meant that the refund transaction in question had been called off.

\[emphasis added in bold and underline\]

17     Apart from the foregoing, there was _no other evidence_ in the Defendant’s affidavit on the Alleged Refund Arrangement.

18     This was notwithstanding that the Plaintiff had, by way of his reply affidavit, exhibited a copy of the Settlement Agreement[^11] which clearly did not contain any express term obliging the Plaintiff to return “_GTB coins_”, or otherwise impose _any_ condition for payment. To the contrary, the Settlement Agreement provided that:

>     “It is a term of this Agreement that no party will pursue any extra claims relating to refunds or conditions of investment, whether dealt with in this Agreement or not…”

19     Belatedly, in the Defendant’s Skeletal Written Submissions filed on 4 March 2021, the Defendant enclosed certain messages exchanged between the parties through the WeChat messaging platform (“**WeChat exchanges**”) which purportedly “_corroborates the Defendant’s assertion…that there was an arrangement for the GTB to be exchanged for monies_”.[^12] No further explanation on the background to these WeChat exchanges was provided.

20     Although this was clearly evidence from the bar, I was prepared to consider whether the Defendant should be allowed leave to adduce these documents as evidence by way of a supplementary affidavit, had these documents been of potential relevance. Therefore, at the oral hearing on 25 March 2021, I invited the Defendant’s counsel to address the court on how these WeChat exchanges purportedly corroborated the Defendant’s case.

21     Counsel for the Defendant then referred me to one particular message dated 21 August 2020 at 6.20PM (“**Message**”),[^13] which counsel for the Defendant explained was a message _from one of the Defendant’s directors to the Plaintiff_. The message was as follows:

>     I’ve already talked to most of them. But the problem can only be solved by cash. They would only give me the B \[the Defendant’s counsel submitted that “B” referred to GTB coins\] because I was going to give them cash. That’s how I could settle it. Because they don’t want to say, \[that they had\] received the cheque, then gave the \[currency\] to you, then they’ll wait. That’s the problem, If the cash is ready, I can settle most of them for you any time. I personally have 60,000 plus dollars and I’ve exchanged 20,000 plus dollars. I’m left with slightly more than 30,000 dollars.

22     The Defendant’s counsel submitted that the Message was evidence of the following arrangement (“**Alleged Refund Arrangement Variant**”):

>     \[The\] Plaintiff is supposed to consolidate GTB from third party purchasers to return to the Defendant. Plaintiff himself also purchased GTB coins. And Defendant was supposed to make payment to the Plaintiff for return of all these GTB coins in the Plaintiff's possession. This refers to GTB coins the Plaintiff himself purchased, and those third parties purchased.

23     I would add at this point that this was the _first time_ the Defendant raised the assertion (by way of oral submissions) that “_“the Plaintiff_ \[was\] _supposed to consolidate GTB from third party purchasers_” and return, not only the GTB coins which the Plaintiff himself allegedly purchased, but also “_those_ \[which\] _third parties purchased_”.

24     In any event, I was unable to see how the Message supported either the Alleged Refund Arrangement or the Alleged Refund Arrangement Variant. I therefore invited the Defendant’s counsel to elaborate on how the Message (or any other document) should be understood to corroborate the Defendant’s case. The Defendant’s counsel submitted, without additional elaboration, that the Message evidenced the Alleged Refund Arrangement Variant.

25     After careful and repeated review of the Message, I was not convinced that it supported the Defendant’s purported defence. The Message appeared to explain certain difficulties which its _sender_ \[i.e. the Defendant’s director\] was facing in resolving claims from third parties, because these third parties were demanding cash payment. There was no mention or even reference in the Message to _any_ arrangement involving a “_return_” of GTB coins _by the Plaintiff to the Defendant_. In fact, the Message referred to the return of certain “_currency_” to the _recipient_ of the Message \[i.e. the Plaintiff\]. Therefore, not only did the Message not “_corroborate_” the Defendant’s case, it painted a picture which is diametrically different from it.

26     Given the peculiarity, I specifically sought confirmation from the Defendant’s counsel that the Message was indeed one emanating from the Defendant’s director to the Plaintiff (and not the other way round). By way of a letter dated 26 March 2021, the Defendant’s counsel confirmed that:

>     \[I\]t is the Defendant’s position that…the \[Message\]…is a WeChat message from the Defendant’s director to the Plaintiff.

27     I am acutely conscious that I should not, on an application such as the present, delve into a detailed examination of the evidence and merits of the putative defence. I am, however, faced with a situation where all the Defendant provided was an ambiguous assertion of a factual situation which formed the basis of his putative defence, and the “_best_” evidence presented to me, from the bar no less, simply did not corroborate the assertion in any meaningful way.

28     This had to be considered against the backdrop that the _undisputed_ contemporaneous documentary evidence (i.e. the Settlement Agreement) made _no reference_ to the Alleged Refund Arrangement (or its variant), and in fact appeared to have excluded it. Furthermore, as the Plaintiff’s counsel pointed out,[^14] even the WeChat exchanges annexed to the Defendant’s skeletal submissions, which purportedly showed correspondence between the parties from August to December 2020, contained no evidence of the Defendant ever requesting the Plaintiff to “_return_” any GTB coins.

29     This was also not a situation where I could envisage obvious difficulties with the Defendant providing _some_ evidence (apart from mere assertion) of its claim. For example, evidence of the Plaintiff’s initial “_purchase_” [^15] of GTB coins, the initial transmission of GTB coins from the Defendant to the Plaintiff, the initial purchase and transmission of GTB coins from the Defendant to the alleged “_third parties_”, discussions on the Alleged Refund Arrangement or even evidence of subsequent follow-ups could have assisted the Court in evaluating whether the Defendant has a _prima facie_ defence. Rather, the Defendant was content to rely on a bare assertion made in its affidavit, without including basic facts such as the number of GTB coins the Plaintiff was supposed to return, the value of those GTB coins and when the GTB coins were to be returned. In any event, the Defendant did not submit that it faced difficulties with adducing evidence of its defence, and did not, despite the Plaintiff’s objections made on this issue,[^16] seek leave to adduce any further evidence.

30     It is the Defendant’s duty on an application such as this to adduce sufficient evidence to establish a _prima facie_ defence. Given the dearth of the evidence before me, the conclusion which I was compelled to draw was that the Alleged Refund Arrangement was a bare assertion from the Defendant, and the Defendant had failed to raise a _prima facie_ defence to the Plaintiff’s claim.

#### The Legal Basis of the Putative Defence

31     In any event, even if I was prepared to tentatively accept the bare assertions of the Defendant as to the existence of the Alleged Refund Arrangement or the Alleged Refund Arrangement Variant, I was not satisfied that they raise a legal defence to the Plaintiff’s claims in this case.

32     From the outset, the Defendant did not clearly explain what was the legal defence it was seeking to rely on. The Defendant’s written submissions put its case as follows:

> 12.    In the present case…the Defendant submits that the cheque was issued only on the basis that the Plaintiff was to return all the GTB coins (“GTB”) in his possession to the Defendant.

> 13.    The Plaintiff failed to return all the GTB in his possession to the Defendant, and the lack of performance on the part of the Plaintiff led the Defendant to believe that the refund arrangement had been called off.

>     …

> 15.    In light of the above, it is submitted that the Defendant has sufficiently established a prima facie defence by showing triable or arguable issues and that the Defendant would suffer injustice if the Defendant were to be unfairly and/or prematurely shut out of the proceedings at this stage.

33     These brief submissions failed to explain nature of the _legal_ defence being asserted. Was the Defendant saying that the return of the GTB is a condition precedent to payment under the Settlement Agreement? Was the Defendant suggesting that there had been a total failure of consideration? Or was the Defendant asserting that it is a term of the Settlement Agreement that the Plaintiff must first return the GTB before the Defendant’s payment obligation arises (i.e. the obligations are sequential)?

34     Although the Defendant need only raise “_triable or arguable issues_”, what is “_triable or arguable_” depended on the nature of the defence being raised. An issue is not “_triable_” or “_arguable_” merely because it is disputed or not admitted – the issue must also be _relevant to a legal defence_.

35     In view of the ambiguity in the Defendant’s position, I sought clarification at the oral hearing from the Defendant’s counsel as to the defence being raised. The Defendant’s counsel submitted that it was relying on the defence of a counterclaim and/or that the Plaintiff had committed a breach of contract.

36     It must be pointed out that a counterclaim is merely a label and therefore it appears that the Defendant is only relying on one legal defence – that of a breach of contract. In my opinion, this is not a legal defence to the Plaintiff’s claim – it neither goes towards defeating one or more elements of the cause of action being asserted, nor sets up an established legal defence to the cause of action alleged. A breach of contract simply gives rise to an independent cause of action, which the Defendant is free to pursue, regardless whether judgment is entered in this action. If the Defendant had filed a defence and raised this claim of a breach of contract therein, this would be a counterclaim which would have been considered together with the Plaintiff’s claim before a final determination was made on both. However, since the Defendant chose not to file a defence, the fact that it believes that it has an independent claim against the Plaintiff arising from the same transaction should not make the judgment obtained by the Plaintiff on its claim liable to be set aside on that basis alone.

37     These hesitations I had were made known to the Defendant’s counsel at the oral hearing and I sought confirmation from the Defendant’s counsel whether, by “_counterclaim_”, he was referring to the defence of set-off or failure of consideration rather than a breach of contract. The Defendant’s counsel answered in the affirmative, without any further elaboration or submission on how the Alleged Refund Arrangement established a _prima facie_ defence of set-off or failure of consideration. Neither did the Defendant’s counsel seek leave to file further submissions on these additional “defences” raised belatedly in the course of the oral hearing.

38     In the absence of any authority or submission from the Defendant on these potential legal defences, it is impractical for me to conduct a meaningful evaluation of these proposed defences. I do, however, make a few preliminary observations.

39     First, it is clear that as a matter of law, set-off is not a defence to an action on a dishonoured bill of exchange, save in exceptional circumstances or upon strong grounds: see _Yeo Hiap Seng v Australian Food Corp Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 336</span> (“**_Yeo Hiap Seng_**”) at \[33\] and _Newman v. Lever_ (1887) 4 T.L.R. 91. This is so even if the counterclaim giving rise to the claim of set-off is connected with or arises out of the same contract in respect of which the cheque was given. A crossclaim relating to the transaction in which the action on a bill of exchange arose is not a defence to the action on the bill of exchange: see _Yeo Hiap Seng_ at \[33\]. No submission was made that there were such “_exceptional circumstances_” or “_strong grounds_” in this case.

40     Second, although set-off can be a substantive defence to the claim founded on the Settlement Agreement, a significant hurdle faced by the Defendant in this case was that its counterclaim was _unliquidated_, and there had been no attempt at providing a _bona fide_ quantification of it.

41     This is an issue because the Defendant clearly cannot establish a legal set-off, which requires the cross-claim to be “_either liquidated or in sums capable of ascertainment without valuation or estimation_”: see _Stein v Blake_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] AC 243</span> at 251; _OCWS Logistics Pte Ltd v Soon Meng Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] SGHC 382</span> at \[8\] and \[12\]. While an equitable set-off does not require the claim to be liquidated, the loss nevertheless has to be quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith: _Braun Electronics Co Ltd v EZY Infotech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 154</span> (“**_Braun_**”) at \[61\].

42     Although this did not mean that the defendant needed to produce a specific or final figure, there must at least be a _bona fide_ attempt at providing a quantification: see _Hiap Tian Soon Construction Pte Ltd and another v Hola Development Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 667</span> at \[36\] – \[38\]. Otherwise, the court would be handicapped in considering whether (and to what extent) the asserted counterclaim exceeds the main claim, and what is the appropriate order to be made in the face of the asserted set-off: _Braun_ at \[62\] – \[64\].

43     In this case, the Defendant’s counterclaim for return of “_GTB coins_” was clearly unliquidated. Yet, the Defendant provided no quantification of the value of this counterclaim, and produced no evidence on the number of “_GTB coins_” to be returned, the value of those “_GTB coins_”, or even the price at which the Plaintiff allegedly purchased the “_GTB coins_” from the Defendant. Accordingly, it was doubtful if the requirement of a set-off (legal or equitable) had been met.

44     Lastly, while failure of consideration may be a possible defence to a claim on a dishonoured bill, _partial_ failure of consideration is only a defence _if_ it was for a liquidated and ascertainable amount: see _Millennium Commodity Trading Ltd v BS Tech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 98</span> at \[104\]. This was not the case here (or, at least, not what had been established on the evidence). It was not clear if the Defendant was relying on total or partial failure of consideration, but given the undisputed position that the Cheque was issued pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, and the Settlement Agreement contained other terms and obligations, including the obligation of a mutual release, it is difficult to see how any failure to return the GTB coins could have been “_total_” in nature. In any event, neither total nor partial failure of consideration was a “defence” _per se_ to a contractual claim. Insofar as it formed the basis of a set-off arising out of a counterclaim, the Defendant faced the same difficulties as highlighted at \[40\] to \[43\] above.

45     In these circumstances, I would have been hesitant to find that the Defendant had established a _prima facie_ legal defence, _even if_ I was prepared to assume the existence of the Alleged Refund Arrangement or the Alleged Refund Arrangement Variant.

### Other Considerations

46     Given my conclusion that the Defendant had not raised a _prima facie_ defence, it was not strictly necessary for me to consider other factors, such as the reasons given for the default and/or delay.

47     For completeness, however, I would add that the reason given by the Defendant for the delay in making the present application (i.e. the board of directors of the Defendant could not “_agree on the course of action to take”_[^17]) was weak at best given that there was no elaboration on the nature of the disagreement amongst the directors of the Defendant. Furthermore, no reason was proffered to explain why a defence was not filed in the first place. By any measure, the reason put forward by the Defendant for the delay was neither strong nor compelling and are not reasons which could have tilted the scale in favour of setting aside the Default Judgment.

## Conclusion

48     For the reasons above, I dismissed the Defendant’s application to set aside the Default Judgment.

49     In this case costs ought to follow the event. The Plaintiff submitted that costs be fixed at $2,000, while the Defendant submitted the sum of $750. Considering that the affidavit and submissions filed by both parties were not substantial, and the hearing before me took less than two hours, I ordered that costs be fixed at the sum of $800, inclusive of disbursements, to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.
