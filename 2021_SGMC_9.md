9 March 2021

### District Judge John Ng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Loy Jit Chan (Male, 38 years old), pleaded guilty and was convicted of the three charges _MAC 903083_, _MAC 903274_ and _MAC 903278_ of 2020 for the offences under Section 9(1)(e) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014) (“RGA”). He admitted to the Statement of Facts (“**SOF**”) in support of the three charges. He also admitted to four other charges – two under Section 8(1) and two under Section 9(1)(e) – of the RGA and gave his consent for these four charges to be taken into consideration for sentence.

2       The Accused was sentenced to a total of twelve months’ imprisonment and the specified minimum fine of $20,000. The Accused has filed an appeal against the sentence. The sentence of imprisonment and the payment of the fine have been stayed pending the hearing of the appeal. He is currently on bail.

## Charges

3       The Charge in _MAC 903083_ of 2020 reads as follows:

>     “That you, between 2016 and 29 March 2020, did assist in the conduct of remote gambling in accordance with arrangements made by your principal, known to you as “Ah Siang”, _to wit_,

>> a)    by managing a master agent account, styled as ‘A1AG0008’ on “_gd86.io_”, which is a remote gambling service that is not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under Section 40 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014), and recruiting and overseeing about 8 agents and 8 to 10 bettors under the said account, beginning sometime in 2016 to 29 March 2020;

>> b)    creating a player account styled as “AIMB1116” on the said website and entering bets on behalf of Low Eng Pah, known to you as “Derek”, using the said player account, between September 2019 to 29 March 2020; and

>> c)    instructing Soo Bee Leong to act as a “runner” to collect and hand over payments from your agents as and when directed by you, sometime between June and September 2019;

>     and as a result you facilitated one or more individuals to commit an offence under Section 8 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014), _to wit_, with a total bet value of $87,898.10 from 15 to 28 March 2020, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 9(1)(e) of the said Act.”

4       The Charge in _MAC 903274_ of 2020 reads as follows:

>     “That you, sometime in about November 2019, did assist in the conduct of remote gambling in accordance with arrangements made by your principal, known to you as “Ah Siang”, _to wit_, by creating and issuing an agent account, styled as “AIAG0356” on “_gd86.io_”, which is a remote gambling service that is not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under Section 40 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014), to one Khoo Tsu Peng, and also settling of accounts with Khoo Tsu Peng, and as a result you facilitated one or more individuals to commit an offence under Section 8 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014), with a total bet value of $25,339.80 from 15 to 28 March 2020, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 9(1)(e) of the said Act.”

5       The Charge in _MAC 903278_ of 2020 reads as follows:

>     “That you, sometime in 2019 or 2020, did assist in the conduct of remote gambling in accordance with arrangements made by your principal, known to you as “Ah Siang”, _to wit_, by creating and issuing an account, styled as “zzz10” on “_ez123.skk268.com_”, which is a remote gambling service that is not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under Section 40 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014), to one Tan Hock Chuan, and also settling of bets with Tan Hock Chuan, and as a result you facilitated Tan Hock Chuan in committing an offence under Section 8 of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014), with a total bet value of $23,927.75 between 18 to 29 March 2020, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 9(1)(e) of the said Act.”

6       It is pertinent to note that the charge in _MAC 903083/2020_ relates to the managing of a master agent account, the charge in _MAC 903274/2020_ relates to creating an agent account and the charge in _MAC 903278/2020_ relates to the creating of a player betting account. These three charges involved 3 different levels within the remote gambling set-up.

7       In terms of hierarchy, the master agent (who runs the master agent account) is above the agent (who operates the agent account) which is above the player (who bets through the betting account). Several playing accounts for the bettors would be under an agent account managed by an agent and several agent accounts would be under a master agent account managed by a master agent. The master agent in this case was the Accused (see Paragraph 7(a) of the **SOF**).

## Statement of Facts

8       The following are the relevant facts in the **SOF**. On 29 March 2020 at about 2.20pm, the Accused was arrested by officers from the Criminal Investigation Department during an island-wide operation on suspicion of committing offences under s 9(1)(e) of the RGA.

9        _Facts for MAC 903083/2020._ In 2016, the Accused established contact with one “Ah Siang”, the principal, through a mutual friend as he was in financial difficulty. “Ah Siang” suggested that the Accused could make money by being an agent for illegal 4D bets. “Ah Siang” tasked the Accused with managing a master agent account, A1AG0008, on a website known as “86boss”, later renamed “gd86.io”. “gd86.io” is a website providing a remote gambling service, that is not provided by an exempt operator or a person otherwise exempt under s 40 of the RGA. The Accused stood to gain commission from bets placed on “gd86.io”, being 12 cents per every dollar bet (see \[6\] of the **SOF**).

10     Acting as an agent, in accordance with instructions from his principal “Ah Siang”, the Accused assisted in conduct which facilitated one or more individuals to commit an offence under section 8 of the RGA as follows:

> (a)     The Accused recruited about 8 agents and 8 to 10 bettors from his group of friends who were existing gamblers. As a master agent, the Accused was able to open player accounts and other agent accounts. The agents, in turn, would be able to recruit more players. It was also open to the Accused, as master agent, to give a commission to his agents. From 15 March to 28 March 2020, betting records reflected that the total bet value from the Accused’s account “A1A0008” amounted to **$87,898.10** from the punters and agents he oversaw (excluding bets which are the subject of the other charges).

> (b)     The Accused recruited his friend, Soo Bee Leong (“Soo”) as a runner, whose job was to collect the bet money placed by players with the Accused’s agents. This arose because Soo had contacted the Accused sometime between June and September 2019, asking if he had any jobs. At the time, as the Accused had several agents, “Ah Siang” had asked the Accused to find a runner and the Accused in turn recruited Soo. For this job, Soo earned $800 a month, which was later increased to $1,200. The Accused facilitated the payment of Soo's salary from “Ah Siang” to Soo.

> (c)     The Accused assisted in entering bets on behalf of one Low Eng Pah whom he knew as Derek. The Accused and Derek had become acquainted through a mutual friend, Khoo Tsu Peng (“Khoo”) in about September 2019. Derek wished to place his illegal 4D bets through SMS, which service "gd86.io" did not provide. Hence, Derek would send his 4D bets to the Accused by SMS. The Accused created a player account "A1MB1116" for Derek. The Accused would key Derek's bets onto the account "A1MB1116". Thereafter, the Accused would meet either Khoo or Derek to receive Derek's payment in cash.

11      _Facts for MAC 903274/2020._ In about November 2019, Khoo requested an agent account from the Accused on “gd86.io”. The Accused created an agent account styled as “A1AG0356” for Khoo. Khoo was thus able to create player accounts and recruit other players. The Accused would give Khoo a commission of 10% based on bets and 5% based on winnings. The Accused would meet Khoo at Toa Payoh to settle the money.

12     Thus, acting as an agent, the Accused had thereby assisted in conduct facilitating one or more individuals to commit an offence under section 8 of the RGA, in that he had facilitated punters to place bets amounting to $25,339.80 through Khoo’s agent account between 15 March and 28 March 2020 on an illegal remote gambling website, namely “gd86.io”.

13      _Facts for MAC 903278/2020_. Sometime in 2019, “Ah Siang” provided the Accused with 2 agent accounts on illegal horse betting sites, namely “kja03” on “ert369.com” and “cc3488” on “ez123.skk268.com”. The Accused earned a commission of 0.015% of the total tickets from players. Both accounts were closed by the time investigations commenced.

14     Sometime in 2019 or 2020, the Accused’s friend, Tan Hock Chuan (“Tan”) requested a horse betting account from the Accused. Thus, the Accused opened an account with the username “zzz10” under his agent account “cc3488” on “ez123.skk268.com”. Tan requested for a 5% rebate, meaning that if Tan lost $100 on the website, he would only need to pay $95 but if he won $100 on the website, he would receive the full winnings of $100. The Accused acted as a middleman by receiving the approval of “Ah Siang” for the request and subsequently forwarding the account username and password to Tan. Either the Accused or Soo would meet Tan on a weekly basis to settle the money. From 18 to 29 March 2020, bets amounting to $23,927.75 were placed through Tan’s account.

15     Thus, the Accused assisted in conduct facilitating remote gambling by others in accordance with arrangements made by a principal, namely “Ah Siang”, by getting agent account login details of “zzz10” from “Ah Siang” and passing it to Tan, arranging for Tan to receive a 5% rebate and settling the betting money with Tan, which allowed Tan to bet $23,927.75 online through the said remote gambling service between 18 to 29 March 2020. In such manner, the Accused facilitated Tan in committing an offence under s 8 of the RGA.

## Antecedents

16     The Accused has previous convictions for the possession and consumption of controlled drugs, offences under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) for assisting illegal moneylenders and for **acting as a bookmaker under the Betting Act** (Cap 21, 2011 Rev Ed). The antecedents (_not including charges taken into consideration_) are tabulated as follows:

17     The only relevant antecedent was that of the previous conviction on 29 March 2012 (highlighted in bold in the table of antecedents above) for the offence of **Acting as a Bookmaker** under Section 5(3)(a) of the Betting Act. There were also 6 other charges (_DACs 3725-29/2011_ and _DAC 3731/2011_) of the same offence of **Acting as a Bookmaker** under the Betting Act which were taken into consideration for sentence.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

18     The DPP submitted for a global sentence of imprisonment of twelve months and $20,000 fine, and put forth the following factors in support:

> (a)     The Accused had a relatively high position and involvement in the syndicate. The fact that the Accused had a master agent account allowed him to propagate further agent accounts. The Accused oversaw about 8 agents and 8-10 bettors. The Accused recruited Soo as a runner to collect payments from his agents.

> (b)     The Accused’s actions facilitated the growth of the unlawful remote gambling website.

> (c)     The high value of bets ($87,898.10 for the first charge) involved, reflected the large scale of the operation.

> (d)     Highly premeditated and elaborately planned.

> (e)     TIC charges.

19     The Prosecution tendered sentencing precedents to show the range of sentences imposed for RGA offences. The DPP was mindful that a few of the precedents had aggravating factors absent from the present case.

20     The DPP cited the case of _PP v Woon Wei Ke Joshua_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 117</span> at \[44\] for the observation of the court in that case that the length of the custodial sentence bears a broad correlation with the bet values involved. The court in that case indicated a range of 3-4 months’ imprisonment where the bet values are from $9,000 to $15,000, and two months’ imprisonment for smaller bet values of about $5,000.

21     The Prosecution also highlighted the mitigating factors which informed their suggested sentences. These were that the Accused did not actively recruit agents from a wide network. He recruited his friends. The Accused pleaded guilty at an early stage and had substantially cooperated during investigations and this facilitated investigations against the other persons involved in the syndicate.

### Mitigation plea

22     The Accused was represented by counsel. A written plea in mitigation (“Mitigation”) was tendered and the following submissions on sentence were made:

> (a)     Timely plea of guilt and cooperation as a sign of genuine remorse. The Accused assisted the police which resulted in successful investigations against his accomplices.

> (b)     The Accused was not the principal offender and was merely assisting him by creating accounts. The Accused did not share in the profits. The Accused had earned a minor amount of profit from the bets placed.

> (c)     The Accused did not solicit members of the public and only sought out his friends who had already been gambling on 4D and horse racing. The Accused was an individual who had unfortunately facilitated his friend’s gambling proclivities.

> (d)     The Accused is married with one young child of 11 years old. The Accused is the sole breadwinner of the family. His wife was suffering from depression and was recently diagnosed with a lump in her breast which required surgery.

23     The counsel sought a global sentence of imprisonment of between 8 to 10 months (see \[10\] of the Mitigation) but in any event, not more than 10 months and a fine of $20,000 (see \[17\] of the Mitigation).

## Sentence

### The Reasons for the Sentence

24     The offence under Section 9(1)(e) of the Act reads as follows:

>     “Any person who, inside or outside Singapore, assists in any conduct described in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d), and as a result facilitates one or more individuals to commit an offence under Section 8 shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.”

The offence is punishable with a specified minimum fine of $20,000 or with a custodial sentence of up to 5 years’ imprisonment or both. A District Court or a Magistrate’s Court has jurisdiction to try any offence under the RGA and has power to impose the full penalty or punishment in respect of the offence (see Section 36A of the RGA).

25     The RGA is a recent piece of legislation passed into law in 2014 and came into effect on 2 February 2015. Before the RGA was introduced, the regulation of gambling activities came under the Betting Act (Cap 21, 2011 Rev Ed) and the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CGHA”). The Betting Act and the CGHA were enacted before the advent of the Internet. They were not targeted at gambling activities carried out online. The RGA was enacted to tackle the problem of remote gambling and to deal with specific features associated with remote gambling.

#### Approach to Sentencing of RGA cases in Koo Kah Yee

26     I have found the recent case of _Koo Kah Yee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 261</span> (“_Koo Kah Yee_”) decided on 27 November 2020 by the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon to be highly instructive for the sentencing of RGA cases. Even though the case of _Koo Kah Yee_ was specifically concerned with the sentencing for the offence under Section 11 of the RGA, the approach used by the Chief Justice and the sentencing factors considered in that case were highly relevant for the sentencing of RGA cases.

27     It is a comprehensive and principled approach and is helpful for the consideration of the appropriate sentence for the present case. I have used it to calibrate the present sentences but with a caveat that it is for a different provision of the RGA and I am fully aware that the punishment for the offence under s 11(1) is higher than that for s 9(1)(e). Ultimately, the calibration of the appropriate sentence would have to account for the harm caused and the offender’s culpability that is based on the assessment of the circumstances of the case and the relevant sentencing factors.

28     The sentencing approach employed by the Chief Justice was the five-step process as he had set out in the case of _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 12</span> (“_Logachev_”). The first step is to identify (a) the level of harm and (b) the offender’s culpability. This first step is based on the relevant offence-specific factors. The second step is to identify the indicative sentencing range. The third step is to identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range. The fourth step is to make adjustments for offender-specific factors such as the lack of antecedents and pleading guilty at an early stage. The fifth and final step is to take a step back and have regard to the Totality Principle.

29     I found the non-exhaustive list of offence-specific factors set out by the Chief Justice at \[55\] of _Koo Kah Yee_ for an offence under s 11(1) of the RGA to be equally applicable for an offence under s 9(1)(e) of the RGA. Section 9 of the RGA deals with the activities of agents for their principals who are the providers of the remote gambling service. The court would consider the degree of harm caused by the offence and the degree of the offender’s culpability by paying heed to the following non-exhaustive factors:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.92%"> <col width="50.08%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors going toward harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors going towards culpability</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) The aggregate value of bets involved</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Involvement of a syndicate</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) Involvement of a transnational element</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(d) Difficulty of detection</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) Degree of planning and premeditation</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Level of sophistication</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) Offender’s role</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(d) Personal gain</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(e) Duration of offending</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

30     On assessing the degree of harm, it was elucidated by the Chief Justice at \[57\] of _Koo Kah Yee_:

>     “The amounts of bets involved in a particular gambling offence is an important factor in the court’s assessment of harm, ... It is established in the context of ordinary gambling offences under s 5(_a_) of the CGHA, which makes it an offence to assist in the carrying on of a public lottery, that the value of bets placed gives an indication as to the size of the illegal operations (see _Lim Li Ling_ (\[38\] _supra_) at \[92\]). _This logic applies equally to remote gambling operations. Generally, the larger the value of bets collected or transacted, the greater the harm_.” (emphasis in _italics_ mine)

And further at \[60\] of _Koo Kah Yee_:

>     “In a related vein, the difficulty of detecting the offences in question may also be a relevant consideration (see _Law Aik Meng_ at \[25(d)\]). It is not surprising that ordinary gambling activities are often carried out secretly in order to evade detection. However, _when gambling activities are offered on remote or online platforms, these tend to add a further cloak of anonymity to both the providers and participants and make detection even more challenging_ …” (emphasis in _italics_ mine)

31     On assessing the degree of culpability, the Chief Justice stated at \[63\] of _Koo Kah Yee_:

>     “A close examination of the offender’s role is also an important determinant of culpability. In the case of organised or syndicated offences, the offender’s role within the group and the tasks performed is a fact-specific inquiry to be undertaken with care (see for example, _Public Prosecutor v Adri Anton Kalangie_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 217</span> at \[35\]). With other factors remaining constant, operatives who are essentially runners carrying out the instructions of their controllers, would generally be less culpable than the masterminds behind the criminal operations. On the flipside, where an accused person played a pivotal role in a syndicate, this is likely to enhance his level of culpability (see _Law Aik Meng_ at \[17\]). More specifically, where an offender recruits others as accomplices into a criminal operation, that would usually be an aggravating factor, as I indicated in _Mehra Radhika_ at \[25\] and \[53\]. This is particularly true where the offender did so intentionally with knowledge of the illicit nature of the activities as opposed to doing so unwittingly …”

32     As for the offender-specific factors, the Chief Justice observed that they generally apply across different offences and cases, and include:

#### Sentencing Framework for s 9(1) RGA cases

33     At \[83\] of _Koo Kah Yee_, the Chief Justice proceeded to set the appropriate sentencing ranges in a tabular form, after having regard to the full range of punishment prescribed under s 11(1) of the RGA. Adopting a similar scheme, I have adapted that table of sentencing ranges for the present case after having regard to the full range of punishment prescribed under s 9(1) of the RGA as follows:

![]([2021] SGMC 0009_Image/[2021] SGMC 0009_image1.png)

In the use of these sentencing ranges, I would repeat the caution of the Chief Justice at \[84\] of _Koo Kah Yee_ that “the above sentencing matrix is not meant to be applied rigidly and the appropriate sentence in each case must be determined with reference to the specific facts.” These sentencing ranges apply to contested cases. With that, I proceed to explain the sentencing steps I had taken and the factors I had considered for this case.

#### Application of the Sentencing Framework

34     In the present case, the following sentencing factors were considered:

> (a)     The dominant sentencing principle is Deterrence – both General and Specific Deterrence. The Accused had one relevant antecedent. He was sentenced to imprisonment of 5 months and a fine of $50,000 on 29 March 2012 for the offence of acting as a bookmaker under Section 5(3)(a) of the Betting Act. This punishment in 2012 had not deterred the Accused from being involved in illegal gambling activities.

> (b)     In respect of the harm, the amounts of bets placed was a significant indication of the harm caused. The following amounts were involved in the respective charges under s 9(1)(e) RGA against the Accused:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.873225354929%"> <col width="33.4733053389322%"> <col width="32.6534693061388%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Amount</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Period</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 903083/2020 (proceed with)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$87,898.10</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 28 March 2020</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 903274/2020 (proceed with)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$25,339.80</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 28 March 2020</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 903278/2020 (proceeded with)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$23,927.75</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18 to 29 March 2020</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 903273/2020 (TIC for sentence)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$5,473.20</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 28 March 2020</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC 903275/2020 (TIC for sentence)</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,525.50</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 28 March 2020</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (c)     In respect of culpability, the role of the Accused was that of a **master agent** (see \[7(a)\] of the SOF). The Accused operated a master agent account and could issue agent accounts for agents under him. The Accused was also able to act as an agent himself and issue player betting account for punters to place bets. The high position of the Accused within the hierarchy is patently clear. He is occupying a level of position just below the principal “Ah Siang”. Furthermore, the Accused even got Soo to work for him as a runner to facilitate his dealings with the agents under him. \[_Incidentally, Soo was sentenced to 9 weeks of imprisonment on one charge under s 9(1)(e) RGA with one other charge under s 9(1)(e) RGA taken into consideration for sentence_.\]

> (d)     Although there is no evidence that the Accused shared directly in the profits of the whole operation, it was admitted by him that he gained 12 cents from every dollar bet (see \[6\] of the **SOF**).

35     Based on the aforesaid considerations, the Accused’s level of harm and the level of culpability for each of the charges proceeded with should be as follows:

> (a)     For the charge in _MAC 903083/2020_, the level of harm should be in the middle of the Moderate range and the level of culpability should be in the middle of the High range. The harm is in the middle of the Moderate range as the value of the bets for this charge amounted to $87,898.10 over 14 days of betting from 15 to 28 March 2020. This is a substantial sum but not enormous. As for the level of culpability, I was satisfied that he fell at the middle of the High band due to his significant involvement and high position within the hierarchy of the set-up (see \[34(c)\] above). He was a master agent with 8 agents under him. He had recruited a runner to facilitate his dealings with these agents. Based on the table of sentencing ranges at \[33\], the assessed level of harm and culpability would give a sentence of 2½ years or 30 months of imprisonment before accounting for offender-specific factors. After accounting for the guilty plea and the cooperation with the authorities in their investigations against the accomplices, the appropriate sentence should be not less than 20 months of imprisonment. It should be higher if due weight is given to his antecedent of acting as a bookmaker in 2012.

> (b)     For the charge in _MAC 903274/2020_, the level of harm should be at the lower end of the Moderate range in view of the lower amounts of bets involved of $25,339.80 over 14 days of betting from 15 to 28 March 2020. The level of culpability should be in the Medium range, bearing in mind that this was an agent account and not a master agent account. As observed earlier at \[7\], the agent account would be at the middle level of the hierarchy of the remote gambling set-up. Based on the table of sentencing ranges at \[33\], the assessed level of harm and culpability would give a sentence of at least 9 months of imprisonment before accounting for offender-specific factors. After accounting for the guilty plea and the cooperation with the authorities in their investigations against the accomplices, the appropriate sentence should be not less than 6 months of imprisonment. It should be higher if due weight is given to his antecedent of acting as a bookmaker in 2012.

> (c)     For the charge in _MAC 903278/2020_, the level of harm should be at the lower end of the Moderate range in view of the amounts of bets involved of $23,927.75 (which is close to the amount of $25,339.80 involved for the charge in _MAC 903274/2020_) and the level of culpability should be at the middle of the Low range. This charge concerns the creation of a betting account which involved only one punter. Based on the table of sentencing ranges at \[33\], this level of harm and culpability would give a sentence of around 4 months. After accounting for the guilty plea and cooperation with the police, the sentence should not be less than 3 months of imprisonment.

36     The aforesaid assessment and calibration of the sentences reflect the key roles played by the Accused and formed the reasons for the substantial custodial sentences that should be imposed in this case.

37     Based on the aforesaid assessment and calibration, the individual sentences to be imposed for each of the charges would have been 20 months, 6 months and 3 months respectively. The Prosecution had submitted for 9 months for the first charge and 3 months each for the other two charges. The global sentence of imprisonment submitted by the DPP was 12 months while my calibration would have been 23 months. I had accepted the positions of the Prosecution and the Defence that only two of the three terms of imprisonment needed to be run consecutively. This would be in line with the totality principle (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[47\] where it was said that the totality principle is one of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions).

38     At the sentencing of the Accused, I had informed him that the global sentence suggested by the Prosecution was on the low side. I would have imposed a higher sentence in the light of my reading of the decision of the Chief Justice in _Koo Kah Yee_ for the sentencing of RGA cases and the application of the sentencing approach and framework based on the facts and circumstances for the present case. In the absence of submissions by the Prosecution for a higher total sentence, I decided against a heavier overall sentence. Although there are significant reasons and a sound basis for a heavier sentence, I decided to accept the DPP’s submission of 9 months for _MAC 903083/2020_ and 3 months for _MAC 903278/2020_ and to run them consecutively.

39     I did not accept the DPP’s submission of imprisonment of 3 months for _MAC 903274/2020_. The suggested sentence would be too low as it failed to account for the fact that this was an agent account, which is on a higher level than a player betting account in _MAC 903278/2020_. A sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for _MAC 903274/2020_ would be inadequate. I decided on a sentence of 6 months for the reasons I had given in \[35(b)\]. This difference did not affect the final total term of imprisonment of 12 months because the sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for the charge in _MAC 903274/2020_ was ordered to run concurrently.

40     On the imposition of a fine for RGA cases, the Chief Justice held at \[39\] of _Koo Kah Yee_:

>     “In the context of remote gambling offences, deterrence similarly calls for the imposition of fines to disgorge the profits of offenders who may also be sentenced to imprisonment. This is essential to dispel the notion that the pecuniary rewards reaped from unlawful remote gambling activities can be enjoyed without consequence. …”

41     As mentioned earlier at \[34(d)\], there is no evidence that the Accused had shared in the profits of the remote gambling syndicate. However, he had admitted that he would receive 12 cents per dollar bet. For the charge in _MAC 903083/2020_, the bets amounted to $87,898.10 and going by the rate of 12 cents per dollar bet, the Accused would have been enriched by about $10,500 based on this charge alone. There was a total of 5 charges under s 9(1)(e) RGA in this case for which the Accused assisted his principal in the remote gambling business for total bets amounting to $144,164.35 (see the table of amounts involved in the 5 charges at \[34(b)\]). Based on the rate of 12 cents per dollar bet, the Accused would have received about $17,300 in total for the 5 charges. Therefore, the sentence of a fine of the specified minimum of $20,000, as submitted by both the DPP and the defence counsel, was justified to disgorge the illegal gains from the unlawful enterprise.

## Conclusion

42     The total sentence of 12 months of imprisonment and the specified minimum fine of $20,000 is on the low side in view of all the sentencing factors which I have highlighted. Nevertheless, I had refrained from giving full weight to the factors justifying a heavier sentence in this case as the Accused had shown remorse by pleading guilty at an early stage and the DPP had confirmed that his cooperation with the police had facilitated their investigations against the accomplices and other members of the syndicate.

43     I was also mindful that the case of _Koo Kah Yee_ was a very recent decision of the Chief Justice issued at the end of November 2020. It was the first High Court case, on appeal from the State Courts, which had given guidelines on the approach to be adopted for the sentencing of RGA cases and had provided a sentencing framework to calibrate the sentences for s 11(1) RGA cases, which could be adapted for use in the sentences for other RGA offences with similar sentencing factors.
