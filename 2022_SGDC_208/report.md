12 September 2022

### District Judge Ow Yong Tuck Leong:

1       The accused, Manmeet Singh Pannu, a 42-year-old male, pleaded guilty to two proceeded charges and consented to one other charge being taken into consideration (“TIC”) for sentencing.

2       The two proceeded charges were:

> (i)     Committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of his remission order by failing to remain indoors at Selarang Halfway House at the specified time in accordance with s 50V of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, 2000 Rev. Ed.). He breached curfew between 6 March and 15 March 2021. The accused was liable to be punished under s 50Y of the Prisons Act with a sentence not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order (“50Y Charge").

> (ii)     Failing to provide a specimen of urine for a urine test under s 31(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185, 2008 Rev. Ed). The accused was previously convicted of similar offences and liable for enhanced punishment under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The maximum penalty was 13 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane (“LT-2 Charge"). The accused was also subject to a remission order and liable to be punished under s 50T of the Prisons Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order (“50T Enhancement").

3       The TIC charge was for committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of his remission order by failing to remain indoors at Selarang Halfway House at the specified time in accordance with s 50V of the Prisons Act. He breached curfew between 19 April and 23 April 2021. The accused was liable to be punished under s 50Y of the Prisons Act with a sentence not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order.

4       I sentenced the accused to seven years, six months’ and 488 days’ of imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, with an enhancement of 326 days’ imprisonment. Pursuant to the Criminal Motion 28/2022 order granting an extension of time, the accused filed an appeal against his sentence on 29 August 2022. The Accused is presently serving his sentence. These are the grounds for the sentence imposed.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

8       Taking into account the accused’s early plea of guilt, the Prosecution submitted the accused be sentenced to 488 days’ imprisonment for the 50Y Charge (consecutive); seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment, with six strokes of the cane for the LT-2 Charge; and 326 days’ imprisonment for the 50T Enhancement (consecutive).

9       The present case was similar to _Amanshah Bin Omar v PP_ (“_Amanshah_”), which was addressed in _Abdul Mutalib bin Aziman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 1220</span> (“_Abdul Mutalib_”) at (\[119\] to \[125\]). In _Amanshah_, the accused also faced a s 50Y charge and a repeat LT-2 charge with s 50T enhancement among his four proceeded charges.

10     For the 50Y Charge, the Prosecution submitted that the present case should similarly be situated at the higher end of Band 2 in the _Abdul Mutalib_ framework for the reasons highlighted in _Amanshah_ (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[120\]). For the accused’s repeat LT-2 Charge with 50T Enhancement, the Prosecution first submitted that there should be a 6-month uplift in the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane as the offender was already convicted of an LT-2 offence previously on 14 September 2016. Furthermore, the 50T Enhancement for the present case should be similarly situated at the mid-point of Band 3 in the _Abdul Mutalib_ framework for the reasons highlighted in _Amanshah_ (_Abdul Mutalib_ at \[121\]).

11     The Prosecutor submitted the following table showing the breakdown in individual sentences for the present case, with comparisons to the sentences in _Amanshah_:

### Mitigation

12     Counsel submitted that the accused be sentenced to 488 days’ imprisonment for the 50Y Charge; seven years’ and three months’ imprisonment, with six strokes of the cane for the LT-2 Charge; and 326 days’ imprisonment for the 50T Enhancement. This was similar to the Prosecution’s sentencing position for the 50Y Charge and 50T Enhancement.

13     On the 50Y Charge, Counsel agreed with the Prosecution that the present matter was most similar to that of _Amanshah_. Counsel agreed with the Prosecution that this matter would fall within the higher end of Band 2 of framework the _Abdul Mutalib_. Counsel submitted that the proposed sentence of 488 days’ imprisonment, being 60% of the maximum sentence of 814 days was fair and just on the facts of the present matter. As per _Amanshah (Abdul Mutalib_ at \[122\]) and given the nature of the offending in the present matter, the indicative sentence for the 50T Enhancement would be 5/6 of the maximum term of 767 days’ imprisonment, being 639 days’ imprisonment. However, this added together with the sentence for the 50Y Charge would be more than the outer limit of the sentence, being 814 days (the maximum for the 50Y Charge). In the circumstances, Counsel urged the court to limit the sentence for the 50T Enhancement to 326 days. This would result in a cumulative total sentence of 814 days for both the 50Y Charge and 50T Enhancement.

14     Counsel urged the court to sentence the accused to seven years’ and three months’ imprisonment, with six strokes of the cane, for the present charge. Although the sentenced proposed by the Prosecution was not excessive in and of itself, Counsel urged the court to consider the principles of totality and proportionality in sentencing. Counsel referred to the principles in sentencing a multiple offender in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ \[2018\] 5 SLE 799 at \[98\]. Given that the aggregation principle provides that the totality principle ordinarily applies with greater force in cases that involve longer aggregate sentences, Counsel urged the court to consider the same and to limit the sentence for the LT-2 Charge to seven years’ and three months’ imprisonment, with six strokes of the cane.

15     In reply, the Prosecution submitted that the court in _Amanshah_ had already taken the totality principle into account when determining that the repeat LT-2 sentence was seven years’ and six months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution referred to the case of _Cheang Geok Lin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 548</span> (“_Cheang_"), which was a Magistrate’s Appeal decided by The Honourable the Chief Justice. The court noted that the sentence for repeat LT-2 offences would normally be eight years’ imprisonment (see _Cheang_ at \[34\]).

### Court’s Decision

16     The sentencing framework principles in _Abdul Mutalib_ apply to the present case (see _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[87\]). The ss 50Y and 50T of the Prisons Act provide a mechanism to rescind the whole or part of the remission period granted to an offender in respect of his original offence(s) so as to deter him from reoffending after his release from prison, while incentivising him to stay crime-free for as long as possible (see _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[35\]).

17     The sentencing court should first determine the imprisonment sentence for the s 50Y offence, given that imprisonment was mandatory for the s 50Y offence. In relation to s 50T, the court had a discretion whether to impose an enhanced sentence. The cumulative sentence imposed under ss 50Y and 50T could not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offender’s earliest offence.

18     The sentencing band approach applied to both sentencing for ss 50Y and 50T. The sentencing band framework comprised a three-fold classification of “low”, “moderate” and “high”, with each classification being tied to the serious breach of the mandatory aftercare conditions or the severity of the fresh offence. The court should identify the appropriate degree of severity within a particular sentencing band and arrive at a fraction or percentage of the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the relevant offence.

19     The sentencing factors relevant to determining the applicable sentencing band was classified into three categories: (a) factors going towards the gravity of the offence committed by the offender while on remission; (b) factors going towards the offender’s rehabilitative prospects; and (c) all other relevant circumstances.

20     I determined the s 50Y offence first. The accused was placed under a structured aftercare regime at SHWH that provided a rehabilitative environment for inmates in the community and help them reintegrate into society. The breach was relatively grave as the accused had stayed away for a substantial duration of 196 hours and 12 minutes until he was arrested (versus 279 hours and 25 minutes in _Amanshah_). The breach was committed very soon, about one month after his release from prisons (versus two months in _Amanshah_). He did not return to the half-way house despite repeated reminders from the staff to do so. The accused demonstrated a lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration on his part. He breached curfew again while on bail, which was the subject of the TIC Charge, see \[3\] above. I placed little weight on the accused’s guilty plea as a mitigating factor. He was caught “red-handed” breaching curfew. I decided that the degree of severity to be at the upper end of Band 2, at 60% of 814 days (the remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offence) and 488 days’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the 50Y Charge.

21     Next, I considered the LT-2 Charge. On the day of arrest on 23 April 2021 for breaching curfew at SHWH, the accused was subsequently placed under arrest for drug consumption. He provided a urine sample which was only sufficient for the purposes of an IUT. The IUT result slip indicated that the accused’s urine sample was tested positive for amphetamine, opiate, and benzodiazepines. The accused was warned that it would be an offence if he failed, without reasonable excuse, to provide his urine sample for urine tests as required. He was offered water, but he refused it. Repeated warnings were administered, and the accused was offered water at 30-minute intervals. The accused was examined by a physician and recorded as being able to pass urine. There was no medical condition or excuse that may impact on his ability to cooperate fully with the testing regime.

22     I decided that a sentence of seven years, six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane would be appropriate in the present case. It is clear that Singapore takes a strict stance on drug and substance abuse. The courts will deal firmly with offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act, including offences involving the circumvention of the urine procurement process, which is key in the detection of a drug consumption offence. The accused’s deliberate refusal to provide his urine specimen to the officers in the present case was likely to be motivated by a desire to conceal his illicit consumption of drugs. Two factors warranted a sentence above the mandatory minimum. The first was the fact that this was a repeat LT-2 offence. The second factor that warranted a sentence above the mandatory minimum was the lack of remorse evident from the fact that the accused had committed the fresh offence while on bail and breaching curfew (see _Cheang_ at \[34\], \[35\] and \[37\]).

23     Turning to the indicative sentence for the 50T Enhancement, I noted that the gravity of the fresh offence, being a repeat LT-2 drug offence was moderate to high. The fresh offence was committed two months after his release from prison. The accused’s prospects of rehabilitation were not promising. He had a string of drug-related convictions, which include drug trafficking, suggesting that he had not been able to rehabilitate himself. The indicative sentence for the 50T enhancement of 639 days, at 5/6 of the remaining remission period of 767 days would be appropriate. In order for the aggregate sentence under ss 50Y and 50T to not exceed the total remission period of 814 days, I reduced the enhanced sentence to 326 days.

#### Aggregate Sentence

24     I ordered the sentence for the 50Y Charge, the LT-2 Charge and the 50T Enhancement to run consecutively. The 50Y Charge and LT-2 Charge were distinct and do not form part of a single transaction. The sentence for the 50Y Charge and the 50T Enhancement have to run consecutively pursuant to ss 50Y(5) and 50T(5). Having regard to the totality principle, taking a ‘last look’ at all the facts and circumstances of the case at hand, I considered the aggregate sentence to be proportionate to the gravity of the accused’s offences and not crushing, having regard also to his drug-related antecedents, his most recent aggregate sentence, and his future prospects (see _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[86\]).

25     The accused was sentenced to an aggregate custodial sentence of seven years, six months’ and 488 days’ of imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, with an enhancement of 326 days’ imprisonment. I ordered the sentence to be backdated to 15 March 2021 and to take into account the periods of remand to exclude the bail period, under s 318 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed).
