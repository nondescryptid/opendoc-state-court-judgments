### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Background to the Case

1       The Accused had committed a massive misappropriation of funds involving S$40,622,169.79 and US$147,000. These funds belonged to various companies and entities. The Accused was given access and/or control over these funds by virtue of him being employed (1) as a liquidator of the companies; (2) as a receiver for the assets of a person; and (3) as an agent to operate a company’s bank account. Instead of applying these funds for their intended purposes or accounting for them back to his principals, the Accused used the funds unlawfully to benefit himself. The Accused also concealed his wrongdoings.

2       Arising from the Accused’s criminal acts, the Prosecution tendered 693 charges for various offences committed by him.

3       The Accused was tried in the High Court for 50 charges of Criminal Breach of Trust as an Agent under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 22 charges under the 1985 Rev Ed and 28 charges under the 2008 Rev Ed) (“the CBT offences”). Briefly, the Accused misappropriated more than S$40 million over a period of ten years in his capacity as a liquidator, receiver and manager. The nett amount misappropriated was around S$24 million after accounting for the monies the Accused misappropriated from one or more victims to repay other victims and concealing his wrongdoings. On his conviction (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 851</span>; <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 72</span>), the Accused was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 25 years and ten months’ (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span>).

4       The Accused appealed against both his conviction and sentence. The Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 757</span>; <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 13</span>).

5       For the remaining 643 charges, the Prosecution opted to proceed against the Accused in the District Court. These 643 charges thus came before me.

## Proceedings in the District Court - present set of charges

6       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following three charges:

> (a)     One charge of Forgery of a Document punishable under s 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Forgery offence”);

> (b)     One charge of Making a False Statement in a Statutory Declaration punishable under s 14(1)(_a_)(ii) of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap 211, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Oath offence”); and

> (c)     One charge of Transferring Benefits of Criminal Conduct under s 47(1)(_b_) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the CDSA”) and punishable under s 47(6)(_a_) of the CDSA (“the CDSA offence”).

7       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. I found him guilty and convicted him accordingly.

8       The Accused then admitted to the remaining 640 charges, which are set out below:

> (a)     Two charges under s 417 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”);

> (b)     182 charges under s 465 of the PC;

> (c)     235 charges under s 14(1)(_a_)(ii) of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap 211, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the ODA”); and

> (d)     221 charges under s 47(1)(b) of the CDSA and punishable under s 47(6)(a) of the CDSA.

9       The Accused consented to having these 640 charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing

10     After having carefully considered the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the Defence’s plea-in-mitigation, I imposed the following individual sentences and aggregate sentence.

> Table A – Sentence passed by the Court

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="7.32%"> <col width="27.4%"> <col width="27.12%"> <col width="38.16%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge Number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-925507-2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Forgery offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Four months' imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-900376-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The Oath offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25 days' imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 (in default, five days' imprisonment)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC-901150-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">The CDSA offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Four months' imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="" colspan="4" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Aggregate Sentence</b> : Four months and 25 days' imprisonment (with effect from the expiry of current imprisonment term being served) and a fine of $1,000 (in default, five days' imprisonment)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

11     As the Accused was then serving a sentence of imprisonment for the CBT offences (see \[3\] above), s 322(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) applied to this case. Section 322(1) of the CPC states:

> **322.**—(1)    Where a person who is an escaped convict or is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced again to imprisonment, the latter sentence of imprisonment must begin either immediately or at the end of the imprisonment to which he was previously sentenced, as the court awarding the sentence directs.

12     I ordered the Accused’s aggregate sentence to take effect from the end of the imprisonment term passed by the High Court (see \[3\] above).

13     The Accused was dissatisfied with the sentences imposed and filed an appeal against sentence.

## Facts of the Case

14     The Accused is a Malaysian citizen with Singapore permanent resident status. He was 66 years of age when he appeared before me.

15     The Accused was a Certified Public Accountant (“CPA”) and an Approved Liquidator registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.

16     The Accused was the managing partner of Ewe Loke & Partners (“ELP”), a Certified Public Accounting firm. ELP was registered on 2 September 1998. From 2002 to July 2012, the partners of ELP were the Accused, Loke Poh Kuen (“Loke”) and Mitsuru Morii (“Morii”).

17     The Accused was a director of E & M Management Consultants Pte Ltd (“E & M”), a firm in the business of providing tax and financial consulting and corporate restricting services. E & M was registered on 20 July 1990 by the Accused, Loke and Morii.

### Role of a company liquidator and receiver

18     A liquidator is an officer appointed when a company goes into winding up or liquidation. When a company is being wound up, the company’s business ceases to operate and its assets and affairs are handed over to a liquidator, whose powers, duties and functions are set out in s 272 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the CA”). The liquidator’s roles include the following:

> (a)     Investigate into the affairs and assets of the company, the conduct of its officers and the claims of creditors and third parties;

> (b)     Recover and realise the company’s assets in the most advantageous manner to the company;

> (c)     Adjudicate the claims of the creditors and ensure an equitable distribution of the company’s assets in accordance with the provisions of the CA.

19     When a company goes into receivership, all assets of the company will be transferred into the control of a receiver. A receiver may be appointed by the court or a creditor, and he is entrusted with custody of the property of the company, including its tangible and intangible assets and rights. His responsibility is to liquidate all available assets and rights of the company, and ensure as much debt as possible is repaid to the creditors.

20     When the Accused was appointed as a liquidator or receiver by virtue of his status as a CPA, he was also subject to the Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities. Under this Code, when a CPA is entrusted with money or other assets belonging to others, he should:

> (a)     Keep such assets separately from personal or firm assets;

> (b)     Use such assets only for the purpose for which they are intended;

> (c)     At all times, be ready to account for those assets, and any income, dividends or gains generated, to any persons entitled to such accounting; and

> (d)     Comply with all relevant laws and regulations relevant to the holding of and accounting for such assets

21     When the Accused was appointed as a liquidator or receiver, he was employed as an agent of these companies, and was authorized to have control over the bank accounts and assets of the companies, in order for him to make payments to creditors and to recover the companies’ assets.

### Commission of the offences

22     The pertinent parts of the SOF which sets out the commission of the three proceeded charges are reproduced below:

> **First Information Reports**

> 10.    The initial complaint was lodged by Hewlett Packard, who had appointed the Accused to manage the members’ voluntary liquidation of its subsidiary companies. The case came to light in late July 2012 when the Accused delayed convening the final meetings for the Hewlett Packard subsidiaries, and confessed that he misappropriated the monies from the subsidiaries.

> 11.    Subsequently, Technology Partners International, Singapore Branch (“TPI”) and Loke Poh Keun, a partner of Ewe, Loke & Partners, lodged reports against the Accused. It was alleged that the Accused had also misappropriated monies from TPI and other companies that he was liquidating.

> **Modus Operandi**

> 12.    Investigation revealed that the Accused misappropriated a total of S$40,623,313.61 and US$147,000 from companies in which he was appointed liquidator, receiver or provided outsourced accounting services. The offences were committed between February 2002 and July 2012.

> 13.    The Accused opened separate bank accounts for each of the companies that he was liquidating so as to facilitate the monitoring of assets in each company. All liquid assets of each company would be transferred into the bank account (opened by the Accused) relating to that company. As a company’s assets are converted into cash, these funds would also be deposited into the bank account designated for that company. As the authorized signatory of these bank accounts, the Accused was entrusted with dominion over the monies in the bank accounts, and was authorised to make payments relating to the companies’ official matters, for e.g. to pay dividends to shareholders, repayments to creditors or liquidation expenses.

> 14.    The Accused withdrew monies from the companies that he was liquidating by issuing, from the bank accounts he had opened for the companies, either cash cheques, or cheques to bank accounts (“intermediary bank accounts”) controlled by him. The intermediary bank accounts where the cheques were deposited into are:

>> a)    Ewe Loke & Partners Maybank Clients’ Account (Account No. XXX);

>> b)    E&M Management Consultants Maybank Clients’ Account (Account No. XXX); and

>> c)    E&M Management Consultants Standard Chartered Account (Account No. XXX).

> The Accused had control of these intermediary bank accounts as he was a signatory of the accounts, and had access to cheques which had been pre-signed by Morii.

> 15.    The Accused then used the monies to gamble or repay his personal debts, or to reinstate the amounts that he had previously misappropriated from the companies.

> 16.    Between July 2009 and July 2012, the Accused misappropriated a total of S$17,381,088.63 and US$147,000 from 6 Hewlett Packard subsidiaries which he was liquidating. He also misappropriated S$11,980,058.16 from 15 other companies that he was liquidating between February 2002 and June 2011.

> 17.    The Accused was also engaged by TPI to manage its accounting needs and bank account in Singapore. The Accused, after he had been entrusted with dominion over the money in TPI’s bank account (Standard Chartered Account No. XXX), misappropriated a total of S$10,581,000 from the said bank account between December 2007 and July 2012.

> 18.    To conceal his misdeeds, the Accused forged bank statements and made false declarations to the Official Receiver.

> 19.    The net loss to the affected companies is approximately S$24 million.

> **Facts relating to the 456th charge (** **_ie_** **the Oath Offence)**

> 20.    On 30 September 2009, Hewlett-Packard appointed the Accused as a liquidator to manage the members’ voluntary liquidation of its subsidiary, Compaq Asia Pte Ltd (“Compaq Asia”).

> 21.    The Accused opened a bank account for Compaq Asia in October 2009 with Maybank and was the sole signatory of the account. The assets of Compaq Asia were moved into this bank account. The Accused was thus entrusted with dominion over the monies in this account in the way of his business as an agent of Compaq Asia.

> 22.    Between 5 November 2009 and 18 March 2011, the Accused issued cheques from this account, amounting to a total of $2,035,040.00, which were made payable to E&M Management Consultants’ Standard Chartered Account, or in cash.

> 23.    None of the funds were used to pay for any expenses relating to Compaq Asia.

> 24.    A liquidator is required to submit a Form 75 to the Official Receiver and Registrar of Companies every 6 months. On the last page of the Form 75, the liquidator has to make a statutory declaration verifying that the form’s contents are a full and true account, and he also needs to declare that he has not received or paid out any monies apart from what is specified in the form.

> 25.    On 15 June 2012, in respect of Compaq Asia Pte Ltd, the Accused made a statutory declaration before Pascal Baylon Netto, a Commissioner for Oaths, with the following false statements, namely, that:

>> a.    The account of receipts and payments set out in above (in the Form 75) contains a full and true account of my receipts and payments in the winding up of that company from Wednesday, October 12, 2011, to Wednesday, April 11, 2012 \[and that\] I have not, nor has any other person by my order of for my cause during that period, received or paid any moneys on account of the Company; and

>> b.    The particulars contained in the statement of the position in the winding up made up to Wednesday, April 11, 2012 set out above are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

> 26.    The above statements in the statutory declaration were false as the account of receipts and payments did not reflect the monies he had misappropriated from the account of Compaq Asia Pte Ltd, or that the said misappropriated monies had in fact been paid to E&M Management Consultants, or in cash to the Accused. Instead, they showed the accounts as though the misappropriations had not taken place.

> 27.    The statement of the position in the winding up (required under Section 317 of the Companies Act) was thus also inaccurate as it did not show the above discrepancies in the accounts. The Accused knew that the above statements were false.

> 28.    The false declaration was submitted to the Official Receiver in order to conceal his acts of misappropriation.

> 29.    By his conduct, the Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 14(1)(a)(ii) of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Chapter 211).

> **Facts relating to 232nd charge (** **_ie_** **the Forgery offence)**

> 30.    In 2007, TPI engaged E&M Management Consultants to manage its accounting needs in Singapore and also manage its Singapore bank account (a Standard Chartered account bearing no. 0102139032). Pursuant to this purpose, the Accused was appointed as TPI’s external accountant.

> 31.    The officers of TPI were Gerald Clark and Arno Franz. They, together with the Accused and Morii, were the 4 signatories of TPI’s bank account. The Accused was made one of the authorized signatories of TPI’s account as part of his role as the company’s accountant. The Accused was thus entrusted with dominion over the funds in the bank account of TPI in the way of his business as an agent of the company. To make any withdrawal from TPI’s bank account, approval from Gerald Clark was required.

> 32.    As two signatories were required for cheque withdrawals or fund transfers from the bank account, the Accused asked Morii to pre-sign blank cheques and transfer request forms. Morii did so, as he trusted the Accused. In fact, Morii was not handling the work for TPI, was poor in his English, and did not in fact realise or notice that he was a signatory for TPI’s bank account.

> 33.    Using the pre-signed cheques, the Accused either issued cash cheques from TPI’s bank account or cheques to a bank account of Ewe Loke & Partners or E&M Management Consultants that was controlled by him. There were a total of 129 transactions involving TPI’s account, and the Accused did not seek approval from TPI for these withdrawals.

> 34.    The Accused then used the monies to gamble, repay his personal debts or to reinstate the amounts he misappropriated from other companies previously.

> 35.    Between 30 May 2011 and 17 May 2012, the Accused misappropriated a total of S$1,860,000 from TPI’s Standard Chartered Bank account (bearing no. XXX).

> 36.    Between 2 June 2012 and 20 July 2012, the Accused misappropriated a total of S$510,000 from TPI’s Standard Chartered Bank account (bearing no. XXX).

> 37.    In order to cover up the above misappropriation of funds, the Accused, sometime in July 2012, forged a Standard Chartered Bank SGD Business$aver Statement, for the period of 1 June 2012 to 30 June 2012, in the name of TPI, in relation to the account bearing number XXX, to reflect a balance of S$248,252.28, when in fact this was not true.

> 38.    The Accused intended for the above forged bank account statement to be believed by the staff of TPI that it was issued by Standard Chartered Bank, so as to cover up his misappropriation of funds by showing a balance as though no wrongdoing had taken place.

> 39.    By his conduct, the Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **Facts relating to 648th charge (** **_ie_** **the CDSA offence)**

> 40.    On 19 May 2010, the Accused dishonestly misappropriated S$700,000 from Technology Partners International Inc (relating to charge TRC 900032/2015), which is an offence under Section 409 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224), by transferring the sum into E&M Consultants Pte Ltd’s Standard Chartered account no.: XXX.

> 41.    On 19 May 2010, from the above misappropriated sum, the Accused transferred S$500,000 to Tan Kim Sing (a gambling junket operator) by way of a cashier’s order from E&M Consultants Pte Ltd’s Standard Chartered account no.: XXX, for the purpose of repaying a loan. This loan arose due to credit extended by Tan Kim Sing to the Accused during gambling trips.

> 42.    As such, the Accused, on 19 May 2010, in Singapore, did transfer property, namely, a sum amounting to S$500,000 to Tan Kim Sing, which property in whole directly represents the Accused’s benefits from criminal conduct, that is, criminal breach of trust as an agent under Section 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 43.    By his conduct, the Accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 47(1)(b) and punishable under Section 47(6) of the CDSA’

## The Accused’s Antecedents

23     The Accused is presently serving an imprisonment term of 25 years and ten months (see \[3\] above). Apart from this, the Accused does not have any other antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

25     In support of its sentencing position, the Prosecution submitted that the sentencing principles of specific and general deterrence were applicable to this case. The Prosecution relied on _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[21\] and \[24\] where the court held :

> 21.    Specific deterrence operates through discouraging effects felt when an offender experiences and endures the punishment of a particular offence. Drawing from the maxim “once bitten twice shy”, it seeks to instil in a particular offender, the fear of re-offending through the potential threat of re-experiencing the same sanction previously imposed.

> … …

> 24.    General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the public by making an example of a particular offender.

26     The Prosecution also submitted that the court should consider the harm caused by the criminal acts and the degree of culpability of the Accused.

27     The Prosecution highlighted that the Accused had forged the bank statements in order to prevent the staff of TPI from finding out that he had been pilfering the company’s funds. The Prosecution further submitted that the forged bank statement and the false statutory declaration were difficult to detect, as the only persons in Singapore who would know that the details in the documents were in fact false would be the Accused. For the forged bank statements, the Accused covered his tracks sufficiently well such that TPI did not discover the misappropriation for five years. This was testament to the difficulty in detecting the forgery of the bank statements. With regards to the false statutory declaration, anyone seeking to check on the accuracy of the declaration made by the Accused would have to face the laborious task of checking the documents on the financial affairs of Compaq and the bank accounts holding Compaq’s assets.

28     The Prosecution also pointed out that the offences committed by the Accused were clearly premeditated. They were meant to serve one specific purpose only and that was to conceal the misappropriation of the funds by him. The Accused had concealed his tracks so well that he was able to pilfer the funds entrusted to him for about a decade.

29     The Prosecution was mindful of the fact that the forgery and false declaration offences did not add to the monetary loss caused by the CBT offences. The Prosecution submitted that this did not make it a mitigating factor. On the contrary, these forgery and false declaration offences resulted in the continuance of the main offending _ie_ the CBT offences.

30     In respect of the commission of the CDSA offences, the Prosecution argued that it reflected one of the main motivators for the misappropriation of the moneys – the Accused had used portions of the misappropriated sums to fund his gambling needs. This was an aggravating factor.

### The Accused’s Plea-in-Mitigation

32     The main thrust of the Accused’s plea-in-mitigation was that the Accused was already 68 years old (at the time of sentencing by this court). The Defence highlighted that Chan J had initially found that the appropriate aggregate sentence of imprisonment for the CBT offences was 28 years. However, given the Accused’s age (which was 65 years old then), Chan J had avoided giving a sentence that was tantamount to a life imprisonment term. Chan J thus ordered only three sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 25 years and ten months. The Defence thus submitted that in the present case, if this court were to make an order that the sentence should commence at the end of the existing sentence for the CBT offences, then such an order would undermine Chan J’s sentencing decision.

### Defence’s Address on Sentence

33     The crux of the Defence submission on sentence was that this court should not view the present three proceeded charges in a _silo_, apart from the CBT offences. The Defence argued that the exercise of the Prosecution’s discretion to stand down the 643 charges (at the High Court stage) and then subsequently proceed with these charges in the District Court cannot alter the context within which these charges had arisen. The Defence submitted that there were two strands to this argument and these submissions are reproduced below:

> (a)     First, while it is trite that the Court would only exceptionally order more than two sentences to run consecutively, it cannot be that this principle can be circumvented by the Prosecution’s decision to simply stand down charges and proceed with them later on and ask that the new sentences be deferred to start at the end of the existing aggregate sentence so as to bypass this principle. If that were the case, a perverse outcome would result and may be illustrated as follows. If an accused person faces four charges, the Prosecution may choose to stand down 1 charge, proceed to obtain a conviction on three charges and (exceptionally) obtain an order that all three sentences are to run consecutively. The Prosecution might then proceed with the one stood down charge and ask that the sentence for the stood down charge run _consecutively_ with the existing aggregate sentence (comprising the three sentences of the charges initially proceeded upon).

> (b)     Second, even if the stood down charges were to resume in another proceeding and were to be treated separately, there is no reason why the Court should defer the commencement of the sentence to the end of the existing sentence. If they were truly to be treated as separate, they ought to run immediately as a matter of course.

34     The Defence therefore submitted that any sentence of imprisonment imposed in respect of the three proceeded charges in the present case should commence at the date of sentencing. In real terms, this would mean that the sentences imposed in the present case would run concurrently with the aggregate sentence imposed by Chan J for the CBT offences.

## This Court’s Decision on Sentence

35     In sentencing the Accused, I followed the two-step sentencing approach enunciated in _Mohammed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>:

> (a)     At the first step, I considered the appropriate sentence for each charge. In this regard, I weighed and assessed the aggravating and mitigating factors and also took some guidance from relevant case precedents; and

> (b)     At the second step, in determining which of the sentences ought to run consecutively or concurrently, I was mindful of the one transaction rule and the totality principle.

36     I would like to highlight that Chan J also adopted this approach (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span> at \[6\]).

37     Thus, having decided the individual sentence for each proceeded charge and thereafter the cumulative sentence, I then proceeded to consider the date on which the sentence of imprisonment ought to commence under s 322(1) of the CPC.

38     When Chan J sentenced the Accused, he had considered the following aggravating factors (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span> at \[26\] to \[29\]):

> (a)     The large amounts involved;

> (b)     The number of charges and victims; and

> (c)     The prolonged period of offending.

39     Chan J had also considered the following mitigating factors (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span> at \[30\] to \[32\]):

> (a)     The co-operation rendered by the Accused during investigations;

> (b)     Allowance given for the indirect partial restitution furnished by the Accused; and

> (c)     The absence of prior criminal antecedents.

40     I was mindful not to double count the above aggravating and mitigating factors during my deliberation on sentence in the present case.

41     That said, I could not ignore the fact that for each proceeded charge in the present case, the Accused had committed numerous similar charges which he had admitted and consented to being taken into consideration (“TIC”) (see \[8\] above). In _Public Prosecutor v UI_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 500</span> at \[38\], the Court of Appeal held:

> But, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased (see _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts_ (LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2003) at p 77). This is commonsensical as the offender, by agreeing to have the TIC offences in question taken into consideration for sentencing purposes, has in substance admitted that he committed those offences. This would _a fortiori_ be the case where the TIC offences and the offences proceeded with are similar in nature (_eg_, if both sets of offences consist of sexual offences against the same victim) As Tay Yong Kwang J stated in _Navaseelan Balasingam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 767</span> at \[17\]:

>> While it may be said that by admitting the charges taken into consideration, the \[offender\] had saved \[the\] court time and the Prosecution the trouble of proving \[those charges\], the counterbalancing effect of having admitted such charges would be that the \[offender\] had committed many more similar offences and that fact must aggravate the charges proceeded with. The benefit to the \[offender\] would be his immunity from being charged or tried for the offences taken into consideration (see s 178(2) of the \[Criminal Procedure Code\]) and he would therefore not have to face further punishment in respect of those offences. \[emphasis added\]

42     The TIC charges in the present case were in the hundreds. In my judgment, this was a significant aggravating factor. After weighing the other aggravating factors and the mitigating factors, the presence of such a large number of TIC charges warranted an increase of the individual sentence for each proceeded charge.

43     Given the magnitude and breadth of offending, I did not harbour any doubt that general and specific deterrence ought to be the primary sentencing objectives in the present case.

44     I now turn to deal with the individual sentence for each proceeded charge.

### The Forgery offence

##### (1)   Prosecution’s submissions

45     The Prosecution referred the court to several cases and the more pertinent ones were:

> (a)      _Tan Kim Huat Jerry v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 100</span>

>> The Appellant was a used car dealer. He sold a secondhand “Porsche Boxster” motor vehicle to a buyer for $110,000. After the transfer of the Porsche to the buyer was registered with Land Transport Authority (LTA), a contractual dispute arose between Appellant and the buyer over the sale of the vehicle. The Appellant called off the sale but the buyer refused to return the Porsche. The Appellant then resorted to forging and sending four documents to LTA in order to induce LTA to believe that the transfer of ownership of the vehicle was a mistake and to undo the transfer, so that the Appellant could regain legal ownership and possession of the vehicle. The forgeries were discovered by an LTA officer. The Appellant pleaded guilty to one charge under s 465 of the PTC with three other charges under s 465 of the PC taken into consideration for sentencing. The Appellant’s sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was upheld on appeal.

> (b)      _Public Prosecutor v Ho Wei Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 121</span>

>> The offender used his home computer, scanner and printer to reproduce a used HDB season carpark label. The forged label was then displayed on his vehicle. In using the forged label, the offender sought to avoid parking fee amounting to $88.20. The district judge found that the offence required thought, planning and premeditation and that this was not an impulsive act or committed on the spur of the moment. Furthermore, the forgery was targeted at the HDB, and the loss was one suffered by a public body in the performance of its public functions. Fraud on the authorities called for a deterrent response. Finally, the court found it necessary to deter similar acts of forgery. The district judge thus sentenced the offender to six weeks’ imprisonment.

> (c)      _Public Prosecutor v Chin Tze Jien Leonard_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 136</span>

>> The offender was a principal consultant of PurpleTrain.com. Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Informatics Holdings Ltd (‘Informatics’). His duty was to market licences of Informatics granting the right to recruit students in certain foreign countries. Feeling obligated to his bosses at Informatics, and being under pressure to produce results, the offender forged a reseller agreement in the sum of $500,000 and also forged the corresponding cheque deposit for 10% ($50,000). He then submitted these forged documents to Informatics, which in turn, went public with the falsely inflated sale figures. The offender pleaded guilty to one count of forgery under s 465 of the PC. Three other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender was given a three months’ imprisonment sentence and also fined $10,000 (in default 3 months’ imprisonment). The district judge held that even though there was no financial gain to the offender, _eg_ in terms of commission, the primary consideration in sentencing was the magnitude of the crime, and the forgery of a document representing such a high value transaction must attract a sentence that would adequately punish and deter similar acts.

46     The case precedents cited by the Prosecution showed the imposition of sentences ranging from four weeks to four months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted that the sentence in the present case should be at the high end of the spectrum for two reasons. First, the aim of the forgery was to avoid detection of the misappropriation offences. Second, the forgery in question was only one amongst a long series of documents which the Accused had to constantly falsify in order to continue hiding his wrongdoings. The Prosecution thus sought a sentence of four months’ imprisonment.

##### (2)   Defence’s submissions

47     The Defence relied on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Lim Kwei Luan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 269</span> (“_Lim Kwei Luan”_) where the offender had forged five monthly statements for a CIMB bank account with the intent of causing Citibank to disburse of loan of $250,0000 to a company in which the offender was a director. The offender’s actions were premeditated and involved significant planning and preparation. The underlying transaction was a high-value transaction meant to defraud a financial institution. The offence was committed by the offender in his capacity as a company director which was a position of trust. In mitigation, the court considered the offender’s clean record; his plea of guilt; and that no loan was disbursed. The district judge imposed a two weeks’ imprisonment term.

##### (3)   Sentence imposed for the Forgery offence

48     I agreed with the sentencing submissions made by the Prosecution (see \[45\] to \[46\] above). I rejected _Lim Kwei Luan’s_ case. On the culpability factor alone, _Lim Kwei Luan’s_ case pales in comparison to the culpability of the Accused. A sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment, when viewed in the context against the Accused’s overall criminality, would have been a mere slap and thus wholly inappropriate.

49     In my judgment, the indicative starting sentence should be an imprisonment term of three months. In view of the large number of TIC charges (see \[8(b)\] above), an uplift of one month’s imprisonment was warranted. The sentence for the Forgery offence was thus four months’ imprisonment.

### The Oath offence

##### (1)   Prosecution’s submissions

50     The Prosecution provided a table of case precedents which suggested that the sentencing benchmark is a custodial sentence of one month’s imprisonment. The Prosecution submitted, without stating more, that the sentencing benchmark should apply.

##### (2)   Defence’s submissions

51     The Defence submitted that the appropriate sentence should be three weeks’ imprisonment. The Defence relied on the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Wang Chin Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 268</span> and _Public Prosecutor v Sulaiman Damanik and another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGDC 175</span>. These two cases concerned supply of a kidney for valuable consideration contrary to the Human Organ Transplant Act. One Tang Wee Sung (“Tang”) required a kidney transplant. Tang engaged Wang Chin Seng (“Wang”) to source for a donor who was willing to donate his kidney for a fee. Sulaiman Damanik (“Sulaiman”) was identified as a potential donor. Sulaiman agreed to donate his kidney for a fee of 150 million rupiah (approximately S$23,700). One Toni was enlisted to act as liaison between Sulaiman and Wang. Sulaiman made a false statutory declaration that he had agreed to participate as a living donor in a kidney transplant surgical operation for Tang and that no monetary or financial gain was procured for his consent. Sulaiman was coached by Wang to lie on oath.

> (a)     In respect of Sulaiman’s offence for making a false declaration under oath, he was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.

> (b)     Wang played an instrumental role in coaching Sulaiman and Toni to make the false declaration. For abetting Sulaiman to lie on oath, Wang was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.

##### (3)   Sentence imposed for the ODA offence

52     The cases cited by the Prosecution are unreported cases. Sentencing precedents without grounds or explanations should bear little weight, if any, because they are unreasoned. Such decisions had to be approached with caution: see _Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span> at \[13(b)\] and _Keeping Mark John v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 627</span> at \[18\].

53     However, I noted that the Prosecution’s submission on the benchmark sentence of one month’s imprisonment was not too far off from _Sulaiman’s_ case.

54     Having reviewed the case precedents cited and bearing in mind the specific facts of the commission of the ODA offence by the Accused, the indicative starting sentence should be three weeks’ imprisonment. After accounting for the TIC charges (see \[8(c)\] above), an uplift was necessary and I arrived at a sentence of a month’s imprisonment for the ODA offence.

55     On the day when the sentence was pronounced, it dawned on the court that for the ODA offence, the court should also impose a fine. Both the Prosecution and the Defence informed the court that the fine component of the sentence is discretionary. Erring on the side of caution, I then revised the sentence for the ODA offence to 25 days’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 (in default, 5 days’ imprisonment).

### The CDSA offence

##### (1)   Prosecution’s submissions

56     The Prosecution provided a table of case precedents for the court’s consideration. The Prosecution highlighted that the sentence for a CDSA offence is generally directly linked to the amount involved. Hence, where the amount involved is in the region of $500,000, the sentence ought to be an imprisonment term ranging from 18 to 24 months. The Prosecution submitted that in the present case, a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment would be fair.

57     It is observed that the cases cited by the Prosecution are unreported cases and such decisions had to be approached with caution (see \[52\] above).

##### (2)   Defence’s submissions

58     The Defence sought a sentence of two month’s imprisonment. The Defence relied on the cases of _Chong Kum Heng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1056</span> (“_Chong Kum Heng”_) and _Public Prosecutor v Ho Mak Yuk_ \[2017\] SDGC 23 (“_Ho Mak Yuk”_).

59     In _Chong Kum Heng_, the High Court set out the broad sentencing ranges for amounts up to $40,000. As the amount involved in the CDSA offence was $500,000, _Chong Kum Heng_ was not helpful. But the Defence pointed out that _Chong Kum Heng’s_ broad sentencing ranges was adopted from the proposed sentencing ranges in _Ho Mak Yuk_. In _Ho Mak Yuk_, the district judge’s proposed sentencing range for amounts from $300,000 to $500,000 would be an imprisonment term of 12 to 13 months. After adjusting for a slight uplift based on _Chong Kum Heng’s_ decision to _“ensure that the respective sentencing ranges suggested do not leave gaps between the respective bands”_ and also to account for accused persons who did not plead guilty and where none of the money misappropriated was recovered, the Defence submitted that the starting indicative sentence should be 12 to 14 months’ imprisonment.

60     From the said starting indicative sentence, the Defence calibrated it downwards on account of the Accused’s plea of guilt as well as the partial recovery of the misappropriated amount in the predicate offence (_ie_ the CBT offences). In the Defence’s assessment, the appropriate sentence for the CDSA offence was two months’ imprisonment.

##### (3)   Sentence imposed for the CDSA offence

61     For CBT offences, the key indicator of the harm perpetrated as well as the culpability of the offender is the amount misappropriated. After this is determined, a preliminary sentence may be derived. Following which, discounts or uplifts to the preliminary sentence may be allowed in the particular case depending on the aggravating and mitigating factors of each case: _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span> at \[9\]. In my view, this sentencing methodology is consistent with that espoused in _Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 606</span> at \[101\], \[104\] and \[109\] which deals with offences under s 44(1)(_a_) of the CDSA.

62     The table of case precedents submitted by the Prosecution did not show or provide a consistent sentencing approach. I was therefore not persuaded by the Prosecution’s argument that the sentence ought to be an imprisonment term ranging from 18 to 24 months. In any event, during oral arguments, the Prosecution conceded that the cases it had cited predate _Ho Mak Yuk_ and the Prosecution accepted the sentencing ranges proposed in _Ho Mak Yuk_.

63     I was therefore inclined to adopt the proposed sentencing ranges in _Ho Mak Yuk_. However, I did not agree with the Defence’s calibration of the indicative starting point. In my assessment, the indicative starting sentence for the CDSA offence should be 15 months’ imprisonment.

64     I disagreed with the Defence that a downward adjustment of the indicative starting sentence was warranted. On the contrary, I found that an uplift was warranted (see \[42\] above). The TIC charges are set out in \[8(a) and 8(d) above\]. In my judgment, the appropriate sentence for the CDSA offence was 20 months’ imprisonment.

65     Having determined the individual sentence for each of the proceeded charges, I turned my attention to the application of s 307(1) of the CPC.

### Section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code

66     Section 307(1) of the CPC states:

> **307.**—(1)    Subject to subsection (2), if at **one trial** a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted must order the sentences for at least 2 of those offences to run consecutively. (emphasis mine)

> (2)    Where a sentence of life imprisonment is imposed by the General Division of the High Court at a trial mentioned in subsection (1), the other sentences of imprisonment must run concurrently with the sentence of life imprisonment, except that where the Court of Appeal sets aside or reduces the sentence of life imprisonment then the Court of Appeal may order any of the other sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

67     The Accused was first tried in the High Court. The Accused’s trial in the High Court was a distinct and separate proceedings from the current case. Therefore, I have to apply s 307(1) of the CPC afresh to the three proceeded charges in the present case.

68     In this regard, in its written submissions, the Prosecution argued:

> 34.    It is also submitted that the forgery and ODA offences are separate and distinct from the CBT offences, though they may flow from the same broad source. This is because each of the CBT offences were complete, in and of themselves. Each act of misappropriation completed the offence, and Ewe had achieved his aim i.e. to obtain money. By committing the forgery and ODA offences, what Ewe wanted to do was to _continue_ committing fresh acts of misappropriation, by concealing his existing wrongs from detection. To conclude that the forgery and ODA offences are part of the same transaction as his CBT offences would be tantamount to accepting that an offender who commits an offence, then destroys evidence of it, would be as culpable as another who does not erase his tracks.

69     I agreed with the Prosecution.

70     In my judgment, the sentences of imprisonment for the Forgery and ODA offences ought to run consecutively. And I so ordered. The combined sentence was therefore four months and 25 days and a fine of $1,000.

71     In _Lim Seng Soon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 1 SLR 1195</span> (_“Lim Seng Soon”)_, the High Court held that the sentence for a CDSA charge should not run consecutively with the matching predicate offence where the two offences were part of the same transaction. As such, in the present case, I ordered the sentence of imprisonment for the CDSA offence to run concurrently with the combined sentences for the Forgery and ODA offences.

72     That said, the cumulative sentence for the Forgery and ODA offences is still less than the 20 months’ imprisonment given for the CDSA offence. I then exercised my sentencing power to revise the sentence for the CDSA offence. In this regard, I relied on _Lim Seng Soon_ where the High Court held that s 307(1) did not negate the fundamental duty of the sentencing judge, which was to ensure that the punishment imposed should fit the crime and the criminal. At \[40\] of the judgment, the High Court held:

> Conversely, where, _but for the effect of s 307(1)_, the sentencing judge would have imposed a _shorter_ total sentence having regard to the central issue of whether the aggregate punishment was proportionate to the offender’s criminality, it would be equally permissible for the sentencing judge to re-calibrate (_ie_ reduce) the _individual_ sentences such that, at the final stage of the sentencing process, after those re-calibrated sentences were ordered to run consecutively, the aggregate sentence is one that is just and proportionate in the circumstances.

73     The sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment for the CDSA offence was thus re-calibrated to four months’ imprisonment and ordered to run concurrently with the cumulative sentence for the Forgery and ODA offences.

74     In my judgment, the aggregate sentence of four months and 25 days’ imprisonment and fine of $1,000 did not run foul of the one transaction rule and the totality principle (see _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>).

### Section 322(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code

75     Let me first summarised the respective positions taken by the Prosecution and the Defence:

> (a)     The Prosecution’s position was:

>> (i)       The sentence for the CDSA offence was to commence immediately (_ie_ on the day the sentence was passed); and

>> (ii)       The combined sentence for the Forgery and ODA offences was to run at the end of the existing sentence for the CBT offences.

> (b)     The Defence’s position was that the three individual sentences should be ordered to run immediately (_ie_ on the day the sentence was passed).

76     I disagreed with the Prosecution and Defence. With regards to the Prosecution’s position, this was a modified application of s 307(1) of the CPC. It is clearly against the plain wordings of s 307(1) of the CPC. With regards to the Defence’s position, it had failed to apply s 307(1) of the CPC.

77     The case of _Public Prosecutor v Hang Tuah bin Jumaat_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 527</span> (_“Hang Tuah”_) clearly demonstrated that s 307(1) of the CPC must be applied first before the sentencing court can proceed to consider s 322(1) of the CPC.

78     In _Hang Tuah_, the offender was convicted by the district judge on one charge of sexual penetration of a minor. On conviction, the offender pleaded guilty to five other charges, four relating to driving without a valid licence and one for the possession of obscene videos. He was sentenced to a total of four years 11 months’ imprisonment.

79     At the time of sentencing, the offender was in the midst of serving a 12 years’ imprisonment for two previous convictions of rape (involving a different victim) and of driving without a valid driving licence. Pursuant to s 322 of the CPC, the district judge ordered the further sentence of four years and 11 months to commence immediately.

80     When dealing with the issue of sentencing under s 322 of the CPC, the High Court in _Hang Tuah_ provided the following principles to guide the sentencing court (see _Hang Tuah_ at \[24\] to \[34\]):

> (a)     First, the discretion conferred under s 322 must be exercised judiciously.

> (b)     Second, the court was not entitled to backdate the sentence of any offender who was an escaped convict or was undergoing a sentence of imprisonment.

> (c)     Third, in exercising its discretion under s 322, the court should have regard to whether the subsequent offence(s) arose in the “same transaction” as the earlier offence(s), and also the totality of the sentence to be served.

> (d)     Fourth, the court ultimately had the primary duty to determine the appropriate sentence which would best ensure that the ends of justice were met. No single consideration could conclusively determine the proper sentence and, in seeking to arrive at the proper sentence, the court had to balance many factors, sometimes rejecting some. One factor that the court should consider was whether the totality of the sentence served was proportionate to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed by the accused.

> (e)     Fifth, in contemplating the totality of the sentences imposed on the accused, the trial judge should consider this question: if all the offences had been before him, would he still have passed a sentence of similar length? If not, the judge should adjust the sentence imposed for the latest offence in light of the aggregate sentence. Whether this is done by imposing a shorter sentence to run consecutively or a long sentence to commence immediately, does not at the end of the day make much difference, although in principle, the judge should, as far as possible, try to impose a sentence that is reflective of the gravity of the latest offence(s) in question.

81     In my judgment, the Fourth and Fifth principles are most applicable to the present case. It is pertinent to highlight that both the Court of Appeal and the High Court were not cognisant of the additional 643 charges that were brought before me. In his grounds of decision pertaining to sentence, Chan Seng Onn J stated:

> 26.    … In each of the charges, the accused devised a complex scheme which involved a mix of cash payments and encashment of cheques into various company bank accounts which he controlled. The careful planning on the accused’s part is therefore apparent.

> 27.    Furthermore, to avoid detection, the accused would use moneys from the bank accounts of his various victims to reinstate the amounts that he had taken from other companies. .… This allowed his scheme to go undiscovered for almost ten years, from February 2002 to July 2012. Such active and consistent steps taken to avoid detection for a prolonged period is a further aggravating factor.

82     As such, the full extent of the Accused’s concealment of his misdeeds by forging bank statements and making false declarations on oath did not feature in the respective decisions of the Court of Appeal and the High Court.

83     Chan J had given a sentencing discount of 15% per charge (see _Public Prosecutor v Ewe Pang Kooi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 166</span> at \[34\]). Had the full extent of the Accused’s misdeeds and all the 643 charges been brought before Chan J, I did not think that he would have given such a high discount per charge. A lower sentencing discount per charge would therefore lead to a higher sentence per charge. The aggregate sentence would accordingly be increased.

84     It also bears repeating that the Forgery and ODA offences are separate and distinct from the CBT offences. These offences were committed in order that the Accused could continue to perpetuate his CBT offences. Needless to say, the sentences for the Forgery and ODA offences ought to run consecutively to each other and also consecutively with the CBT offences.

85     Having regard to the total criminality of the Accused and the principles of totality and proportionality, I ordered the aggregate sentence for the present case to commence at the end of the Accused’s existing sentence.

86     The final order on sentence is as set out in Table A at \[10\] above.

## Conclusion

87     It is my judgment that the aggregate sentence of four months and 25 days’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,000, with the term of imprisonment commencing at the end of the existing sentence, was on the whole proportionate to the Accused’s culpability.
