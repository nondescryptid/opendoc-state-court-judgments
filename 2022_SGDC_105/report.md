Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 – Driving without due care and attention causing grievous hurt under Section 65(1)(a) punishable under Section 65(3)(a) RTA – Disqualification

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9084/2022/01.\]

23 May 2022

### District Judge Kok Shu-en:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a 41 year old female Singaporean who pleaded guilty to a charge of driving without due care and attention under Section 65(1) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276 (“RTA”), punishable under Section 65(3)(a) of the RTA. The charge read:

> “You… are charged that you on 17 October 2020 at about 4.26pm, along River Valley Road towards the direction of Lower Delta Road, Singapore, did drive the motor vehicle bearing registration SLR7115U on a road without due care and attention, to wit, by making a right turn at the junction between River Valley Road and Irwell Bank Road, against the flow of traffic, resulting in a collision with one Mohammad Nazri bin Abutalib (male, 31 years old), who was the rider of the motorcycle bearing registration FBR6218G, who was proceeding straight from the opposite direction along River Valley Road towards Leonie Hill road (with the right of way), causing grievous hurt to the said Mohammad Nazri Bin Abutalib as he suffered a comminuted closed Right Femur Subtronchanteric fracture, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 65(1)(a) punishable under s 65(3)(a) read with s 65(6)(d) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).”

2       I sentenced the accused to 5 weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified her from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 5 years with effect from the date of her release.

3       The accused is dissatisfied with the sentence and has filed an appeal.

## Facts

4       The accused was the driver of motorcar SLR 7115U at the time of the accident. The victim in this case was a 31 year old male food delivery rider, who was the rider of motorcycle FBR 6218G at the time of the accident.

5       On 17 October 2020, the accused left Takashimaya shopping centre while driving SLR 7115U and headed for her home located in the Clementi area. Before driving off, she switched on the global positioning system (“GPS”) application on her mobile phone and entered her home address into the application, placed this at the left side of the steering wheel and proceeded to drive.

6       At about 4.26pm, the accused was driving along River Valley Road towards the direction of Lower Delta Road, along lane one of three lanes. The accused stopped at a junction between River Valley Road and Irwell Bank Road behind several vehicles as the traffic light signal was red. Irwell Bank Road was a one-way road, and road users were not allowed to turn right into Irwell Bank Road at the junction. There were no traffic markings or traffic signs on the road that indicated that road users could turn right at the junction.

7       At the junction, the accused turned on the right signal and moved forward after the traffic light turned green, braking slightly before the junction and before turning right towards the direction of Irwell Bank Road. The right turn that the accused made into Irwell Bank Road was against the flow of traffic. The accused claimed that she was unaware that she was not allowed to make a right turn at the junction, and that she had been following the directions provided by the GPS.

8       At this time, the victim’s motorcycle was travelling straight from the opposite direction and had the right of way. The accused did not stop as the victim’s motorcycle approached, and this resulted in a collision between the victim’s motorcycle and the accused’s vehicle.

9       At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, the road surface was dry, visibility was clear and traffic flow was moderate.

10     The impact of the collision caused the victim to be thrown off his motorcycle and to sustain grievous hurt. He was conveyed by ambulance to the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) and was diagnosed with having a comminute closed right femur subtrochanteric fracture. The victim underwent surgical fixation for the fracture and was placed on partial weight-bearing for four weeks from the date of his operation on 19 October 2020. He was hospitalised at SGH for 12 days from 17 to 29 October 2020 and was given a total of 60 days of hospitalisation leave from 17 October to 15 December 2020.

11     The victim was transferred to Outram Community Hospital for further rehabilitation on 29 October 2019, but he sought discharge on the same day against medical advice. As such, Outram Community Hospital was unable to comment on the presence of permanent disability or prognosis of the injury.

12     Following the incident, the victim did not work for about a year as he suffered pain in his right leg. As at the time of the hearing, the victim still experienced weakness in his right knee and suffered pain when going up the stairs. He had a metal implant in his right knee.

13     As a result of the collision, the accused’s vehicle sustained dents, scratches and cracks on the front left portion, and the front left bumper was slightly dislodged. The front registration plate was also damaged. The victim’s motorcycle had a ripped and twisted front portion and a dented rear rack.

## Antecedents

14     The accused was untraced.

## Parties’ submissions

### Prosecution’s address on sentence

15     The Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of 8 to 10 weeks, as well as the mandatory minimum disqualification period of 5 years.

16     Applying the sentencing framework set down by the District Court in _Public Prosecutor v Cullen Richard Alexander_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 88</span> (“_Cullen_”), the Prosecution took the position that the harm caused in this case of a medium severity, as the victim had suffered a fracture that required surgery and four weeks of partial weight-bearing, and a significant period of hospitalisation leave. It also noted that the incident affected the victim’s livelihood as a delivery driver for a period, and that he continued to suffer weakness in his knee and pain when going up the stairs. It also argued that there was a considerable degree of potential harm, as there were other vehicles along Irwell Bank Road, and the accused could have collided into them had she successfully executed the right turn against the flow of traffic.

17     As for the level of culpability, it submitted that this should be classified as moderate because she had been completely inattentive when making the right turn at the junction, having failed to observe the lack of indications that such a turn could be made. Further, it noted that the accused had also failed to perform the turn in a safe manner, by failing to show down at any point in time after the stop line and turning right.

18     While the Prosecution accepted that the accused had been relying on the GPS for directions, it maintained that this did not excuse her conduct in any way and urged the court to send a signal to road users – considering the prevalent use of GPS – that it remains incumbent on them to comply with traffic rules, to pay attention to the road and take reasonable precautions for the safety and well-being of all road users.

### Defence’s mitigation plea

19     The Defence sought a non-custodial sentence and the mandatory minimum disqualification period of 5 years. Applying the _Cullen_ framework, the Defence took the position that this was a case falling within the low category for both harm and culpability.

20     On the issue of harm, the Defence argued that this was low as that there was only one closed fracture that required only one surgical fixation, and that there was no evidence to suggest that the injury was of a permanent nature.

21     As for the issue culpability, the Defence argued that the this should be at the lowest end of the spectrum for such offences as the accused had acted in a momentary lapse of judgment due to her unfamiliarity with the junction, and because she had been heavily reliant and focused on following the directions on the GPS. The mitigation plea explained that the accused had only driven two or three times since obtaining her driving licence in Singapore in 2019 and had not driven for several months until the day of the incident. The vehicle that the accused was driving was a newly purchased second-hand car that had been collected just the day before the incident.

22     The Defence also urged the court to consider the accused’s personal circumstances, including the fact that she is the primary caregiver to her two young children, one of whom has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. It argued that a custodial sentence would be a devastating blow to the family and the caregiving of the two young children.

## Reasons for the sentence imposed

23     Section 65(3)(a) of the RTA provides that where grievous hurt is caused to another person by the driving of a motor vehicle by an offender convicted of an offence under Section 65(1) of the RTA, the offender is liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.

24     In addition, Section 65(6)(d) provides that a court is to order that an offender facing punishment under Section 65(3)(a) be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a disqualification period of not less than 5 years.

25     In _Tang Ling Lee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 18</span>, which involved an offence of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act which endangered human life under section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), where the offence is committed in the context of a road traffic accident, the High Court considered that the main parameters for determining the appropriate sentence were: (a) the harm caused by the offence, and (b) the culpability of the offender.

26     Both parties referred to the sentencing framework in _Cullen_ in their sentencing decision, which was the first reported decision of the court for an offence under the current iteration of Section 65(3)(a) of the RTA and was intended to provide guidance in the sentencing of such cases with reference to the harm cause and culpability of the offender. The Defence noted that the _Cullen_ framework is meant to apply to cases involving offenders who claim trial, and so it argued that it does not strictly apply to offenders who had pleaded guilty, such as the accused in this case. Nevertheless, they accepted that the framework provided a helpful reference point for the court’s decision.

27     I agreed with parties that the _Cullen_ framework is a helpful starting point from which reference can be taken in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case. In having regard to the framework in _Cullen_, I am mindful that this framework was set out by the court “_to provide some form of guidance_” and is “_not cast in stone_”.

28     Under the _Cullen_ framework, following the identification of the level of harm and culpability of the accused, the court then identifies the applicable sentencing range based on the following sentencing matrix suggested by the court in _Cullen_ at \[134\]:

29     The next step is to identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range. This to be followed by adjustments to the starting point to take into account offender-specific factors, before finally making further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

30     In determining the appropriate sentence in this case, I considered the harm caused by the offence and the accused’s level of culpability by looking at the factors discussed in _Tang Ling Lee_ and in _Cullen_.

### Harm caused

31     Using the working definitions for the different degrees of harm as suggested by the Court in _Cullen_ at \[110\], I was of the view that the harm caused in this case was in the medium range.

32     The victim sustained a comminute closed right femur subtrochanteric fracture, which the Prosecution characterised as a hip fracture. He underwent a single surgery for this fracture and was hospitalised for 12 days and given a total of 60 days of hospitalisation leave. He was placed on partial weight-bearing for 4 weeks from his operation.

33     On these facts, I could not agree with the Defence that the harm in this case was low, which would typically involve injuries that require conservative treatment and with no or short periods of hospitalisation or medical leave. While it is true that there is no evidence that the injuries are of a permanent nature, if there had been such evidence, this would simply have tended to push the categorisation of the harm caused to a more serious level.

34     That said, I noted that the victim had sought, against medical advice, discharge from the community hospital where he was to have undergone further rehabilitation. Thus, while it was not disputed that the victim continued to experience weakness in the knee and pain while climbing stairs even at the time of the hearing, and was also unable to continue work as a food delivery driver for a year after the incident, I did not give significant weight to these facts in my assessment of the harm caused, since it was unclear to me whether and how the victim’s decision to decline in-patient rehabilitation treatment contributed to this sequalae.

35     In addition to the injuries suffered by the victim, I note that there was also significant property damage. As the vehicle damage report indicated, the motorcycle that the victim was riding had its entire front portion ripped and twisted.

36     In _Public Prosecutor v Koh Thiam Huat_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1099</span>, the High Court observed that when considering the harm caused by the offence of dangerous driving under Section 64(1) of the RTA, “_\[a\] related and equally important consideration would be the potential harm that might have resulted, given that driving is an inherently dangerous activity that can pose serious risk to road users and pedestrians alike_”.

37     In this case, traffic flow at the time was moderate and there were several other vehicles at the junction at the time when the accused moved to make the right turn. Given that the accused was not supposed to have been turning right at the junction, it would have been difficult for other users to anticipate or evade the accused’s vehicle. Had she successfully executed the full turn onto Irwell Bank Road, she would have been squarely against the flow of traffic and the potential of a head on collision with oncoming vehicles would have been high. In my view, there was clearly a significant degree of potential harm that could have resulted from the accident.

### Level of culpability

38     On the issue of the accused’s culpability, using the working definitions of the different levels of culpability suggested by the Court in _Cullen_ at \[109\], I was of the view that the accused’s culpability was at the lower end of the moderate level of culpability.

39     In urging the Court to consider the accused’s culpability as being low, the Defence argued that the accused’s conduct arose out of a momentary lapse of judgment and attention and should thus be considered at the lowest spectrum of culpability. It cited an extract from Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (3rd edn, LexisNexis, 2013), as referred to in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Phui Moi_ \[2021\] 2021 SGDC 193 at \[140\], which states that for offences of driving without due care and attention or inconsiderate driving, “_\[a\]s the degree of culpability is the primary consideration when sentencing, cases of momentary inattention or error of judgment should result in fines whilst terms of custody would be appropriate for cases of deliberate serious risk taking or bad irresponsible driving_”.

40     I note that the offence in question in the case of _Tan Phui Moi_ was that under Section 65 of the RTA _before_ the amendments were made in 2019 to enhance the penalty provisions for such offences. The applicable prescribed penalty at that time was a fine not exceeding $1,000, imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or both, with no differentiated penalty provisions depending on the type of hurt caused by the offender. Accordingly, any precedential value to be gained from this case and commentary on the applicable sentencing norms under the old provision was, in my view, limited.

41     As the High Court in _Tang Ling Lee_ observed at \[47\], “_every instance of negligent driving will almost invariably involve a momentary and unfortunate lapse of attention_”. What the court is concerned with when considering the level of culpability are factors such as (a) the manner of driving, _i.e._ how dangerous the driving was and the extent of danger to road users posed by the offender’s conduct, and (b) the circumstances of driving which might have increased the danger to road users during the incident.

42     The degree of carelessness and inattention attention that the accused displayed was significant in this case – she was firstly inattentive to the road markings and signals that would have indicated to her that she was not supposed to turn right and proceeded to do so. By doing so, she was already in violation of her duty to comply with traffic directions and traffic signs, which is an offence under Section 120(3) of the RTA. The illegal right turn placed her in a position against the flow of traffic, which is undoubtedly a dangerous driving behaviour that has serious potential for harm (as I have noted above at \[37\]). In my view, this factor alone pushed the accused’s level of culpability up from the lower spectrum.

43     After she had turned right at the junction, the accused did not slow down or stop for oncoming vehicles proceeding straight from the opposite direction, which again falls below the level of care and attention that was expected of her even if this was a proper turn.

44     The Defence emphasised that the accused had been relying on the GPS when she made the right turn, as she was unfamiliar with the route. While I was prepared to accept that the accused had genuinely been trying to exercise care, in the sense that she had taken steps to do what she thought was safe driving, however that does not detract from the fact that she still fell far off the mark in terms of the level of care and attention that was expected of her. Reliance on GPS navigation cannot be a substitute for paying proper attention to the road, the signs and signals and other road users, and the fact simply is that she should have been paying attention to these things and was not.

45     The Defence also highlighted the speed at which the victim’s motorcycle was travelling and the observation by the witness that it was the victim’s vehicle that had collided into the accused instead of the other way around. As the High Court held in _Guay Seng Tiong Nickson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 3 SLR 1079</span>, “_\[w\]here the conduct of the victim or third parties, whether negligent or otherwise, has materially contributed to the outcome for which the offender is being charged, but has no bearing on the culpability of the offender, it should not affect the sentence imposed_.” The speed at which the victim was travelling on his motorcycle in this case had no bearing on the accused’s failure to pay due care and attention nor does it impact the assessment of the degree to which she had failed to meet the standard of care expected of all drivers. The accused should not even have been in that spot of the junction in the first place.

### The appropriate sentence to be imposed

46     As I have explained above, I was of the view the level of harm in this case was medium while the level of culpability was at the lower end of moderate. Based on the suggested sentencing matrix, the indicative sentencing range would thus be 3 to 6 months’ imprisonment.

47     In _Cullen_, the offender was travelling on a one lane, two-way road divided by a single white line when he picked up speed and encroached into the lane of the victim’s vehicle, against the flow of traffic. This resulted in a head-on collision with the victim who was travelling in the opposite direction. The victim had suffered a lumbar fracture that was treated conservatively, for which he was warded for 3 days and given 48 days of hospitalisation leave.

48     The court in _Cullen_ assessed the level of culpability to be moderate and the harm caused to be medium, and that the appropriate starting point was identified to be in the lower half level of the indicative sentencing range of 3 to 6 months imprisonment. From this starting point, adjustments were made to account for the offender-specific factors, which in this case was primarily the offender’s plea of guilt, arriving at a sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

49     I was of the view that the level of harm suffered by the victim in this case was comparable, if not slightly more serious than that in _Cullen_. While the spine is arguably a more vulnerable part of the body than the femur subtrochanteric region, which is in the upper thigh region of the body, the victim in this case required surgical intervention and a longer period of hospitalisation and medical leave.

50     As for the level of culpability, I was of the view that the accused’s culpability in this case could be considered slightly lower than the offender in _Cullen_. From the facts in _Cullen_, it is not clear why the offender had suddenly crossed the white line dividing the lanes and encroached into the victim’s lane, but the Court had surmised that the offender had either (1) flouted traffic rules by swerving his vehicle and encroaching into the path of the victim’s vehicle, or (2) had been travelling at a high speed as he approached the traffic light junction, and because he failed to slow down ahead of the traffic light, he lost control of the vehicle and swerved to the opposite side of the road suddenly.

51     In comparison, while the accused in this case had similarly flouted traffic rules and had been inattentive to traffic signs such that she made a turn that placed her against the flow of traffic, she had not been travelling at a high speed like the offender in _Cullen_. In fact, she had been driving at a relatively slow speed as she tried to execute what she thought was a proper turn.

52     Taken as a whole, I was of the view that the facts of the present case were slightly less aggravated than those in _Cullen_ and that the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range ought to be around 3 months imprisonment.

53     Turning to the offender-specific factors in this case, while I was sympathetic to the challenges that a period of incarceration may pose to the caregiving arrangements for her young children, I did not think that the circumstances were so exceptional that would warrant any adjustment to the sentence to be imposed.

54     The accused’s medical condition, which Prisons had confirmed they would be able to manage and arrange for adequate treatment, was also not a factor that warranted any adjustment to the sentence imposed whether as a mitigating factor or as a basis for a plea of judicial mercy. I note that this was acknowledged by the Defence, and the point was not substantively pursued in their oral submissions.

55     Nevertheless, there were in my view a few factors that warranted a downward adjustment from the starting point. The accused was untraced and had pleaded guilty to the charge. Prompt voluntary compensation was made to the victim for his outstanding medical bills amounting to $958.80. The accused had been cooperative with the authorities and had gone so far as to contact the driver who had in the vehicle behind her and had witnessed the incident, obtained in-car camera footage from the witness, and provided this to the police. Without these steps, there would not have been any footage of the incident before the court. Taking these factors into consideration, I adjusted the sentence downward to arrive at 5 weeks’ imprisonment.

56     As for the disqualification period, parties were in agreement that the mandatory minimum period of 5 years as stipulated under Section 65(6)(d) of the RTA would be appropriate in this case, and I agreed with this position. The disqualification period was ordered to commence from the date of the accused’s release from imprisonment.

## Conclusion

57     For the reasons set out above, a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment and disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 5 years with effect from the accused’s date of release from imprisonment was imposed. Execution on both the imprisonment term and the disqualification period have been stayed, and the accused is currently on bail pending appeal.
