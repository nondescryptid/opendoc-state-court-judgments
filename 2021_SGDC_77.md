### District Judge Koo Zhi Xuan:

1       The Accused, Mr Lee Xiu Qi, pleaded guilty to the following charge under section 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”):

>     …you, sometime in April 2018, in Singapore, did fraudulently make a false document, _to wit_, a letter granting Planning Permission for proposed additions and alterations to 29G Nim Road Este Villa purportedly issued by one Soh Yu Ting of the Urban Redevelopment Authority dated 16th April 2018, with the intention of causing it to be believed that the said document had been issued by Soh Yu Ting of the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which fact you knew to be false, and have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 465 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       On 6 April 2021, I imposed a sentence of 7 weeks’ imprisonment on the Accused with effect from 20 April 2021. On 19 April 2021, the Accused filed his Notice of Appeal (“NOA”) against sentence.

## Facts

### Statement of Facts

3       The salient portions of the Statement of Facts, which the Accused admitted to without qualification on 9 Nov 2020, are reproduced in the following paragraphs below.

4       At the material time, the Accused was the director of Ah Qi Trading and Construction Pte Ltd. Sometime in March 2018, one Ms Chang (“Chang”), the house owner of the affected unit at 29G Nim Road, Este Villa (“the unit”), approached the Accused to enquire about the building of a roof to cover the 1st level balcony, which is a private enclosed space ("PES"), and the rooftop balcony of the unit. The Accused and Chang agreed to the renovation works. The total cost of the renovation was $24,500.[^1]

5       The Accused submitted an “Application for Renovation to Premises” of the unit to the Management Office of Este Villa (“the MCST”) for approval. The application was approved by the MCST. Renovation works on the unit began and lasted about 5 days in March 2018. Sometime in or around April 2018, the Accused received full payment of $24,500 from Chang.[^2]

6       After the renovation works were completed, Chang informed the Accused that the MCST did not approve of the structure of the renovation works due to certain pillars in them. As a result, Chang requested that the Accused help her obtain approval from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (“URA”). The Accused assured Chang that he had applied for URA approval before and that the application would be approved.[^3]

7       On or about 9 April 2018, the Accused submitted an application for a proposed roof covering of the unit to URA for approval. On 10 April 2018, one Kelvin Yeo from URA informed the Accused that given that the proposed roof covering was more than 2 meters, a change of Gross Floor Area ("GFA") was incurred, and this meant that:[^4]

> (a)     The Accused will need to engage a Qualified Person for the proposed works.

> (b)     The Accused will need to obtain a letter signed by the Secretary or Chairperson of the MCST confirming that the Management Council has given a 90% approval by resolution for the development for the proposed works to the unit.

> (c)     Development charges may be leviable and will be assessed at the formal application stage.

8       The Accused was then invited to withdraw the current application. The Accused withdrew his current application and was refunded the processing fee.[^5]

9       The Accused did not inform Chang or the MCST of URA's reply at \[7\] above, which sets out the prerequisites for URA's approval of the renovation works. This was because the Accused did not want to disappoint Chang. Further, the Accused was worried that URA's reply may result in the dismantling of the renovation works which were already completed.[^6]

10     Sometime in April 2018, the Accused decided to fraudulently make a false document, namely, a letter granting Planning Permission for proposed additions and alterations to the unit purportedly issued by one Soh Yu Ting of the URA dated 16th April 2018 (the “forged letter”). The Accused forged the said document with the intention to commit fraud, in order to deceive both Chang and the MCST that the renovation works he had completed were approved by URA. He did so by editing the text of a genuine URA approval letter which he had received for his previous renovation projects.[^7]

11     Sometime in or around May 2018, the MCST informed Chang that the proposal contained within the forged letter was different from the structure that the Accused had constructed on Chang's property. This was because the proposal did not set out the wooden pillars that the Accused had constructed. Chang requested that the Accused help her resolve this issue.[^8]

12     The Accused proceeded to falsify a further document purporting to amend the forged letter in an attempt to remedy the situation. This document purported to show that Soh Yu Ting of URA granted approval for proposed additions and alterations to the unit "involving a roof with aluminium composite panel sheet, wooden structure and wooden pillar". The Accused passed the further document to Chang to submit to the MCST.[^9]

13     Sometime in January 2019, an Associate Director of the Managing Agent for the MCST (“the Complainant”) sought clarifications from URA on the forged letter. URA then informed the Complainant that the said document was forged and URA did not grant Planning Permission for the Renovation Works on the unit. The various reference numbers in the forged letter did not exist in URA's record. The font on the pages of the forged letter were different from that used by URA, and the validity period stated in the forged letter also differed from genuine documents issued by URA.[^10]

14     Soh Yu Ting from URA confirmed that the renovation works indicated on the forged letter would have resulted in an increase in additional floor area, which may have implications for the levying of development charge, a statutory tax. Based on the works indicated on the forged letter, the development charge was estimated by URA to be $27,090.66. At the material time, while the Accused was aware that a development charge may be leviable, he was unaware of its precise quantum.[^11]

15     On or about 25 January 2019, the Managing Agent for and on behalf of the MCST requested that Chang remove the renovation works done on the unit by the Accused within 7 days. On 1 September 2020, the Accused offered to dismantle “the covering on the 1st storey PES” for Chang for free. On the same day, the Accused also handed a cheque of S$9,000 to Chang, which was the estimated cost of the “Level 1 roofing”.[^12]

16     As of 6 April 2021, the roof in question has not been dismantled yet and was still present at the unit.[^13]

### Further developments subsequent to the hearing on 9 November 2020

17     At the hearing on 9 November 2020, I sought clarification from the Prosecution on the development charge leviable and adjourned the hearing on sentencing.

18     The Prosecution clarified that the development charge is a tax levied by the URA when planning permission is granted to carry out development projects that increase the value of the land. In the present case, the renovation works increased the value of the property due to a resulting increase in GFA. URA also has the discretion to levy the development charge either on the applicant (_ie_, the Accused in the present case) or the property owner.[^14]

19     On 11 January 2021, Defence Counsel wrote to the Court to update that a formal submission had been made by the Accused to URA to determine the actual amount of development charge liable.[^15] Defence Counsel expressed that it was “crucial to factually determine the actual amount of development charge liable … rather than just relying on an estimate”.[^16] This was because:[^17]

>     the URA submission will go towards accurately determining the extent of harm in our client’s case. Generally, the lower the quantum of the development charge liable, the lower the harm caused. Taking this point at its highest and because of the way development charge is calculated, if no development charge is ultimately incurred or if the quantum is $0, then it may be said that the government was not actually a victim on these particular facts.

20     At the hearing on 1 March 2021, the Prosecution tendered URA’s detailed calculation for the development charge leviable for the proposed works. The development charge calculated in that document amount to a figure of $39,650.80. The Accused then sought an adjournment to consider his next steps. At the hearing on 6 April 2021, the Accused proceeded to mitigate without contesting URA’s detailed calculation of the development charge leviable (_ie_, the sum of $39,650.80).

### Antecedents

21     The Accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

22     The Prosecution submitted that at least 10 weeks’ imprisonment should be imposed on the Accused. The Prosecution relied on the following arguments:

> (a)     The Accused’s fraud defeated the statutory purpose of the development charge and effectively defrauded the Government of S$39,650.80.

> (b)     Documents issued by construction authorities such as the URA for addition and alteration works are important documents that may potentially raise issues relating to public safety. Although the forged document in the present case did not relate to public safety, general deterrence remains a relevant sentencing principle and offenders must be deterred from forging documents issued by URA which often have serious public safety ramifications.

> (c)     The Accused forged a document purportedly issued by a public authority – the URA. Forgery of documents issued by public authorities erodes the public’s confidence in the said authority, and this is an aggravated form of forgery justifying a deterrent sentence.

> (d)     The Accused’s act of forgery demonstrated thought, premeditation and careful planning.

23     The Prosecution highlighted the case of _Tay Boon Hui Freddy v Public Prosecutor_ (Magistrate’s Appeal No 260/2012/01) (“_Freddy Tay_”), a matter involving s 466 of the PC, _ie_, forgery of a document “purporting to be made by a public servant in his official capacity” which attracts a higher maximum imprisonment sentence (10 years) as compared to a s 465 PC offence (4 years). The Prosecution submitted that given the higher imprisonment sentence imposed in _Freddy Tay_, a sentence of at least 10 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate here, since the Accused was convicted for a s 465 PC offence. The Prosecution also sought to distinguish the cases the Accused had relied on.

## Mitigation

24     The Accused submitted that if the Court was minded to impose an imprisonment sentence, it should be no more than 2 weeks.

25     The main arguments relied on by the Accused were as follows:

> (a)     The Accused never intended to cheat URA. He had done so because the MCST had approved the Accused’s application in March 2018 in error; it had failed to realise and inform the Accused that URA approval was first required. The Accused’s motivation in committing the forgery was so as not to disappoint Chang. There was an absence of “any motive or desire for purely financial gain” unlike various cases involving “opportunistic cheat\[s\] who had offended purely for financial gain”.[^18]

> (b)     The “actual offending quantum” was $9,000, which was the cost of the renovation works paid by Chang for the roof which was wrongfully constructed. As the Accused has since compensated Chang by paying her $9,000, and has offered to dismantle the roof without cost, Chang has not been put out of pocket and there is therefore no resulting harm.[^19]

> (c)     The Accused is remorseful, has been cooperative with the authorities, and has pleaded guilty at an early opportunity.

> (d)     The Accused’s industry has been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic; and he is the primary breadwinner to his wife and to his aged parents.

26     The Accused highlighted a number of s 465 PC cases involving either the forgery of documents issued by public authorities or the defrauding of public authorities using forged documents. Using these cases, the Accused submitted that an imprisonment sentence of no more than 2 weeks should be imposed in the present case.

27     While the Accused did not dispute URA’s subsequent calculation of the development charge (_ie_, $39,650.80), the Accused submitted at the hearing on 6 April 2021 that the Court should not take into account the quantum of the development charge for sentencing purposes. This is because there was no “virtual certainty that the State would indeed earn this $39,650.80 worth of development charge”.[^20] Such a tax, it was submitted, was one which Chang would most likely be unwilling to pay if the URA submission had been made prior to the renovation works and the amount known to Chang. Given that the forgery has since been discovered, and the exact amount of development charge made known, it is “highly likely” that the roof would be dismantled to obviate the basis of the development charge altogether. On the other hand, if the forgery was not discovered, the development charge leviable “would not have come to light and Chang would not have therefore known that she needs to pay such a development charge”.[^21] The Accused therefore submitted that it would “not be fair” to take into account the development charge quantum for sentencing purposes.[^22]

## The Court’s decision on sentence

### Factors bearing on the seriousness of the offence

28     Section 465 PC states that whoever commits forgery shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both. Offences under s 465 PC vary widely in form and severity.

29     In the present case, given that an official document from a public authority (_ie_, URA) had been forged, it was clear that the custodial threshold has been crossed. While the Accused was charged and convicted under s 465 of the PC, the offence committed here was in fact “analogous to an aggravated form of forgery punishable under ss 466 and 467 of the \[PC\]” (_Xia Qin Lai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 257</span> at \[29\]).

30     As for the appropriate length of the imprisonment sentence to be imposed, this would turn on “an assessment of the offence seriousness which is determined by the _culpability_ in committing the offence and the _harm_ that the offence caused or was likely to cause” (_Public Prosecutor v Younis Adnan Mohammed_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 143</span> at \[25\], emphasis added).

31     In determining the sentence, I first set out some of the harm and culpability factors the Court may wish to consider in a s 465 PC offence, before turning my attention to the _main_ harm and culpability factors in the present case. With these factors in mind, I then considered the relevant precedents which had been tendered to the Court to arrive at what in my view was the appropriate sentence.

32     In determining the harm caused by an offence of forgery, these are some factors (which are non-exhaustive) the Court may consider:

> (a)     Whether the forgery led to a situation where a public authority could be said to have suffered revenue loss;

> (b)     Whether other individuals or entities suffered financial loss;

> (c)     The damage to a financial or regulatory framework as a result of the forgery;

> (d)     The nature of the document forged. All things being equal, the forging of a document issued by a public authority is more serious as it can undermine trust in public documents and/or the affected public authorities. The severity of the harm caused will also depend on what the document is ordinarily used for.

33     In determining the culpability of an offender who has committed the offence of forgery, these are some factors (which are non-exhaustive) the Court may consider:

> (a)     Whether the forged document was intended to be _submitted_ to a public authority to defraud the authority. Such an act could reflect how brazen the accused person was in committing the act of forgery;

> (b)     The motivation of the offender – whether the act was committed for the purposes of financial gain;

> (c)     The extent of planning and premeditation leading up to the offence;

> (d)     The steps taken in committing the act of forgery to avoid detection. All things being equal, a more sophisticated form of forgery will generally warrant a heavier punishment.

34     The Court should also consider whether there are _other_ relevant aggravating or mitigating factors when calibrating the sentence. Some of these factors (which are non-exhaustive) are:

> (a)     The number of charges to be taken into consideration;

> (b)     Whether restitution has been made by the offender to the victims involved;

> (c)     Whether the offender has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and/or has expressed genuine remorse for his wrongdoing.

### Analysing the main harm and culpability factors in the present case

#### The harm caused by the Accused’s offence

35     I considered the main _harm_ factors in the present case to be as follows:

> (a)     First, a public authority (_ie_, URA) had suffered revenue loss as a result of the forgery. The intent and effect of the forgery committed by the Accused was to create the impression that URA had granted Planning Permission for the renovation works in question, even though URA would have granted the Planning Permission in the present case _only if_ a development charge had been paid, amongst other things. The development charge which URA could have legitimately collected was $39,650.80, which is by no means an insignificant sum.

> (b)     Second, the forged letter was one that was purportedly issued by URA, a public authority. The act of the Accused could undermine the trust and reliance in the documents issued by the URA, and such wrongdoing had to be strongly deterred in the interests of the public.

36     In considering the first main harm factor, _ie_, the revenue loss suffered by URA, I disagreed with the Accused’s submission that the quantum of the development charge should not be considered for sentencing purposes because the payment of the development charge was not “virtually certain” (see above at \[27\]). Accepting this submission of the Accused would have the perverse effect of creating a “win-win” situation for offenders who choose to commit such acts of forgeries. It would mean that if their forgeries are discovered, they can immediately volunteer to unravel what was unlawfully done (or to compensate the public authority for the amount lost or defrauded) to argue that no loss or harm was caused to the public authority; but if the forgery was not discovered, either they or the relevant property owners would then stand to gain a windfall at the expense of the public authority. This cannot be right.

37     In my view, the Court should simply consider whether the forgery did in fact lead to a scenario (albeit falsely manufactured) which would reasonably suggest that the applicable tax in question had been paid. If the forgery did in fact lead to such a scenario, this must mean that the public authority was, at the material time, short-changed of public revenue it could have legitimately collected had all the requirements - _which were side-stepped by the offender_’s _act of forgery_ - been satisfied. The offender would have to be responsible for this loss of public revenue caused as a result of the forgery, even if the payment of such a tax was not “virtually certain” prior to the commission of the forgery.

38     In the present case, the Accused had _known_ that development charges _may be_ leviable, before proceeding to forge the forged letter which sidestepped the entire URA regulatory framework. Even though the Accused did not know the precise quantum at the material time, and his main motivation in committing the forgery was so as not to disappoint Chang (rather than to cheat URA), this goes only towards the extent of his _culpability_. It does not detract from the fact that his act had _caused harm_ to URA in the form of the quantum of the development charge leviable.

39     It also bears mentioning that Defence Counsel had earlier taken the position, in his letter to the Court on 11 January 2021, that it was “crucial to factually determine the actual amount of development charge liable” because this determination would “go towards accurately determining the extent of harm in our client’s case….the lower the quantum of the development charge liable, the lower the harm caused … if the quantum \[turns out to be zero\], then it may be said that the government was not actually a victim on these particular facts” (see above at \[19\]). In my view, the Accused could not have his cake and eat it. If no harm could be said to have been caused to URA had the quantum of development charge leviable been calculated to be zero, harm to URA must be recognised if the quantum of development charge leviable was anything more than zero. As it subsequently turned out, the quantum of the development charge leviable was $39,650.80. There was therefore no basis for me to discount the fact that URA was in fact a victim of the Accused’s forgery, having suffered a revenue loss of $39,650.80.

40     In relation to the second main harm factor, _ie_, the nature of the document forged, I agreed with the Prosecution that forging a URA document such as a letter granting Planning Permission could undermine the trust of the public towards documents issued by the URA, and this was a harm to society which justified a deterrent sentence. A letter granting Planning Permission is an important public document certifying that permission had been granted by URA for the renovation works in question, and members of the public should be able to trust that when such documents are tendered or relied upon, they are indeed genuinely produced and authorized by URA.

41     However, I was not persuaded by the Prosecution that I should consider the fact that “documents issued by construction authorities such as the URA often have serious public safety ramifications” as an aggravating factor. In the course of these proceedings, the Prosecution had clarified, on various occasions, that the forgery committed by the Accused did _not_ implicate public safety implications at all. The regulatory framework which the Accused had side-stepped through his forgery was one which was targeted at calculating the development charge leviable, not the safety of the proposed renovation works.

42     For that reason, I could not accept the point about public safety put forth by the Prosecution as an aggravating factor. The Accused should be punished for the actual or potential harm caused as a result of the forgery of _the particular_ document he had forged. He should not be punished more heavily just because _some other documents_ issued by the same public authority could, if forged, have serious public safety ramifications.

#### The Accused’s culpability in committing the offence

43     I considered the main _culpability_ factors in the present case to be as follows:

> (a)     The Accused’s _main_ motivation for committing the forgery was to not disappoint Chang, as he was worried that URA’s reply might result in the dismantling of the renovation works (see above at \[9\]). He had not planned from the start of the project to commit the forgery for financial gain. I would note, however, that it would surely have struck the Accused that had he come clean to Chang resulting in the renovation works being dismantled, this might have adverse financial implications for him. In that sense, _some_ element of financial consideration could have motivated the Accused in his act of forgery, even if he had not “offended purely for financial gain”.[^23]

> (b)     The offence was not a spontaneous or impulsive act committed on the spur of the moment. Some degree of thought and planning clearly went into the act. Not only did the Accused commit the forgery using genuine URA approvals from his previous renovation projects, he had also forged an _additional document_ subsequently, which he also sent to the MCST and Chang to amend the original forged letter to effectively cover up some mistakes made in his initial forgery (see above at \[12\]). Such acts of forgery which "clearly required thought, planning and premeditation” aggravates the offence (_Public Prosecutor v Ho Wei Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGDC 121</span> at \[10\]).

### Calibrating the appropriate sentence in light of the relevant precedents

44     Having determined what the main harm and culpability factors are in the present case, I proceeded to consider how the appropriate imprisonment sentence should be calibrated. In calibrating the sentence, I had difficulty following the Prosecution’s approach, which appeared to be one where a heavy reliance was placed on _Freddy Tay_, a s 466 PC case involving somewhat analogous facts, in order to determine what the sentence for the present s 465 PC offence should be.

45     In my view, the problem with this approach is that there are simply not enough cases for the Court to derive any form of pattern demonstrating how the sentence for a s 465 PC case should be calibrated downwards when juxtaposed with a s 466 PC case of analogous facts. It was therefore not clear to me why a 10 weeks’ imprisonment sentence should be imposed in this case, which the Prosecution has urged me to impose, just because the offender in _Freddy Tay_ had been sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment by the High Court for a s 466 PC offence.

46     In my view, the preferred approach is that advanced in the Accused’s Mitigation Plea, where Defence Counsel had compared and distinguished the present case with _others 465 PC cases_ which bore several similarities (for example, where an official document purportedly issued by a public institution had been forged), in order to determine what the appropriate imprisonment sentence should be based on the relevant harm and culpability factors I have outlined earlier.

47     I therefore considered in greater detail four s 465 PC cases brought to my attention which I found most relevant and helpful in determining what the imprisonment sentence in the present case should be.

48     In _Public Prosecutor v Ang Wee Tat Vida_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 163</span> (“_Vida Ang_”), the offender had pleaded guilty to many charges, and only two of which involved forgery charges. The forgery charges involve the offender emailing forged copies of letters purportedly issued by Singapore Customs to mislead one of his customers into thinking that the vehicle the customer had purchased was pending clearance from Singapore Customs. The District Judge imposed a sentence of 2 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 465 PC offence.

49     In my view, while the document forged in _Vida Ang_ was also a document purportedly from a public authority, I agreed with the Prosecution that the nature and purpose of the documents forged, when compared to the present case, were drastically different. The forgery in _Vida Ang_ was simply meant to placate the customer that his purchase will be delivered soon, whereas the forged letter in this case was to convince Chang and the MCST that the URA regulatory framework had in fact been complied with. Furthermore, the forgery in _Vida Ang_ did not involve any loss in government revenue on the part of Singapore Customs, whereas URA suffered a revenue loss in the development charge leviable. While the Accused sought to highlight that the offender in _Vida Ang_ had faced many more charges and his criminality was more “deep-seated”, the offender in _Vida Ang_ was in fact separately punished for these other offences. I was therefore of the view that the 2 weeks’ imprisonment sentence imposed in _Vida Ang_ was clearly distinguishable, and the sentence to be imposed on the Accused in this case should be far higher than 2 weeks to reflect the greater public harm caused.

50     In _Tan Kim Huat Jerry v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 100</span> (“_Jerry Tan_”), the offender had forged and sent 4 documents to the Land Transport Authority ("LTA"), to induce LTA to believe that the transfer of ownership of a vehicle was a mistake in order to undo the transfer. The High Court affirmed the decision of the District Judge to impose a sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the s 465 PC forgery offence.

51     The offence in _Jerry Tan_ was more serious than that in _Vida Ang._ As the High Court pointed out, the offender had intended to perpetuate fraud on a public authority (LTA) which could have led to the corruption of LTA records (_Jerry Tan_ at \[12\]). However, unlike the present case, no loss of government revenue on the part of LTA occurred as a result of the offender’s forgery. The forgeries were discovered by a LTA officer even before the intended transfer of ownership was undone. Moreover, the documents which were forged were not official documents purportedly issued by a public authority. No other individual or entity was therefore defrauded into believing that a document purportedly issued by a public authority was genuine. As these were the main harm factors found in the present case, I was of the view that the imprisonment term to be imposed on the Accused should be higher than the 4 weeks imposed in _Jerry Tan_.

52     In _Public Prosecutor v Ang Chee Tiong_ (SC-906088-2018) (“_Ang Chee Tiong_”), a sentence of 5 weeks’ imprisonment was imposed on the offender, for his fraudulent use of a forged document (a notice of renovation purportedly issued by the Housing Development Board (“HDB”)) to defraud the home owner that renovation works were approved. The offender then became uncontactable after receiving partial payments for his services to carry out the renovation works.

53     In my view, the main distinguishing factor between the present case and _Ang Chee Tiong_ is the nature of the documents which were forged and the resulting harm caused, even though both were documents purportedly issued by a public authority. The forged document in _Ang Chee Tiong_ (_ie_, an approval for renovation works in a HDB apartment) appeared to be primarily for noise control, whereas the document forged in the present case was for a far more serious purpose, that of computation of development charges leviable and for URA’s planning control. HDB in _Ang Chee Tiong_ was also not defrauded of any revenue as a result of the forgery committed by the offender.

54     I noted that there were some distinguishing factors which were in the Accused’s favour. In _Ang Chee Tiong_, the offender did not make any restitution for the amount he had cheated his victim of, whereas the Accused in the present case had sought to make full restitution to Chang. However, given the presence of greater public harm in this case, in particular the amount of development charge which URA was short-changed, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence to be imposed would have to be higher than the 5 weeks imposed in _Ang Chee Tiong_.

55     In the case of _Public Prosecutor v Renuga Devi d/o Rajagopal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 39</span> (“_Renuga_”), the offender pleaded guilty to forging a HDB payment receipt of $30,600, which she handed to HDB as proof of her final payment to fraudulently induce HDB to hand over the title deed of a HDB flat. She had committed this offence whilst being investigated for her earlier s 420 PC offence. The District Judge sentenced the offender to 4 months’ imprisonment for the s 465 PC offence.

56     In my view, the offence in _Renuga_ was more aggravating when compared to the present case. This is because the offender in _Renuga_ had attempted to defraud HDB by brazenly forging a HDB document and submitting it to HDB for financial gain; which, if undetected, would have been at HDB’s expense. On the contrary, the main motivation of the Accused in committing the forgery in the present case was not to defraud URA. Furthermore, the offender in _Renuga_ had committed the forgery offence even though she was already being investigated for an earlier property related-offence, and the District Judge had considered this to be aggravating as it showed that she “clearly had not mended her ways … but had instead gone on to commit yet another offence of dishonesty and deception” (_Renuga_ at \[16\]). This factor was not present here; it was the Accused’s first brush with the law.

57     That said, in _Renuga_, it was also considered that HDB “did not suffer any material loss as the forgery was detected immediately, and … the alteration of the payment advice was done in a relatively amateurish way and would have been quite easily detected” (at \[17\]). In the present case, URA did suffer revenue loss; and the forgery did not appear to be as amateurish or as easily detectable. In fact, the forged letter had successfully misled Chang and the MCST into believing that URA had given its approval, and the forgery was only detected when URA was asked about it by the Complainant a few months later. Notwithstanding these factors which were not in the Accused’s favour, I was of the view that the sentence to be imposed in the present case should be far lower than the 16 weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Renuga_, as the offender in _Renuga_ was still much more culpable than the Accused.

58     In summary, a careful consideration of these precedents led me to the view that the imprisonment sentence to be imposed in the present case should be higher than the 5 weeks imposed in _Ang Chee Tiong_ but far lower than the 16 weeks imposed in _Renuga_. With this range in mind, I then considered some of the other mitigating factors in the Accused’s favour, namely:

> (a)     The Accused did not appear to have been motivated purely for financial gain when he committed the offence, as compared to cases of a similar nature where financial gain was the _main_ motivating factor. I also took into account the fact that the Accused was himself put in an unenviable situation by the mistake of the MCST in initially approving the renovation works prior to the obtainment of URA’s approval (see above at \[25(a)\]). While this provided me with a fuller understanding of why the Accused had committed the offence, it nevertheless could not be a valid excuse to forge a document purportedly issued a public authority.

> (b)     The Accused had attempted to make restitution to Chang, by refunding her $9,000 for the cost she had paid for the roof, and offering to dismantle it for her for free.

> (c)     The Accused had been cooperative with the authorities, and had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He appeared to be genuinely remorseful for his actions.

59     Having considered the entire factual matrix of the present case, and all of the relevant precedents mentioned above, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence should be 7 weeks’ imprisonment.

60     A sentence of 7 weeks’ imprisonment is sufficiently lengthy to serve the purpose of deterrence. It would send a clear message (both to the Accused and other would-be offenders) that the forging of documents issued by public authorities, especially an important one like a letter granting Planning Permission, is a serious offence; and that offenders who commit such offences can expect a significant imprisonment term if such forgery should result in a public authority being short-changed of revenue it could have legitimately collected.

61     At the same time, I was satisfied that the sentence imposed was not so severe to be disproportionately crushing. Even though a sufficiently deterrent sentence had to be imposed, I gave due weight to the fact that the forged letter in the present case did not implicate public safety, the Accused’s main motivation for committing the offence did not appear to be for financial gain, and this was the Accused’s first brush with the law. As such, the sentence I imposed was much lower than the 16 weeks’ imprisonment sentence which the offender in _Renuga_ received, even though there was significant revenue loss on the part of URA in the present case (whereas no loss was caused to HDB in _Renuga_).

## Conclusion

62     In conclusion, I was of the view that the imprisonment sentence of 7 weeks I had imposed was appropriate and justified.

63     The Accused was on bail pending his surrender to the Court when he filed the NOA. On 20 April 2021, I granted a stay of execution of the sentence pending appeal. The Accused has also been granted bail pending appeal.
