Estate Agents Act 2010 – Section 44 – Whether parties may, by agreement, deviate from the forms prescribed by the Estate Agents (Estate Agency Work) Regulations 2010

19 October 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Lim Mei Yee Elaine:

1       This is the defendant’s application to strike out the claimant’s claim for the commission due to it under a Commission Agreement concluded between the parties on 19 December 2021. In gist, the basis of the application is that:

> (a)     Pursuant to section 44(1) of the Estate Agents Act 2010 (Cap 95A, 2011 Rev Ed) (the “Act”), the claimant has no _locus standi_ or cause of action due to its failure to use the relevant prescribed form for the Commission Agreement.

> (b)     Furthermore, the Courts are not the appropriate forum to adjudicate the claimant’s claim, in light of section 66(1) of the Act read with regulation 5(1) and the Third Schedule of the Estate Agents (Dispute Resolution Schemes) Regulations 2011 (the “2011 Regulations”).

2       After considering the evidence and submissions of the parties, I grant the application and strike out the claimant’s claim. As the application raises novel issues on the proper interpretation of the abovementioned statutory provisions, I set out the full reasons for my decision.

## Background

3       The claimant is an estate agency company incorporated and operating in Singapore. Ms Tjoa Lie Hung @ Joan Tjoa (“Ms Tjoa”) was the salesperson from the claimant company who had attended to the defendant.

4       The defendant is the owner of a residential property at 13 Prome Road Singapore 328321 (the “Property”).

5       On or about 19 December 2021, the parties concluded a Commission Agreement in respect of the sale of the Property (the “Agreement”).[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) Under the Agreement, the defendant (who was then also a salesperson) agreed to appoint the claimant to market and sell the Property, and to pay the claimant commission equivalent to 1.5% of the sale price of the Property with the prevailing GST upon the completion of the sale. It is common ground that the Agreement is not in accordance with the relevant prescribed form referred to in section 44(1) of the Act: see \[18\] and \[20(e)\] below.

6       Pursuant to the Agreement, the claimant procured a purchaser for the Property, the Property was sold for the price of S$3.98 million, and the sale was completed on or about 19 May 2022. However, the defendant did not pay the claimant any commission under the Agreement. In correspondence exchanged between the parties and/or their solicitors in June 2022,[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) the defendant took the position that:

> (a)     the claimant had been negligent in performing its duties owed to her in the sale of the Property, resulting in the Property being sold at S$520,000 less than its market value;

> (b)     accordingly, she wished to claim the following reliefs from the claimant:

>> (i)       damages in the sum of S$520,000;

>> (ii)       damages for the late completion interest and settlement sum she had paid to the purchaser; and

>> (iii)       a waiver of the claimant’s commission under the Agreement;

> (c)     pursuant to the Council of Estate Agencies’ (“CEA”) dispute resolution scheme, she elected to resolve the said claim by mediation followed by arbitration at the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers, which is an approved mediation centre and arbitration centre under the said scheme.

7       The claimant refused to participate in the CEA’s dispute resolution schemes on the basis that it had no obligation to do so.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) Instead, it commenced this action for the defendant’s failure to pay the commission due to it under the Agreement in the sum of S$63,879.

## Summary of the parties’ respective cases

8       The defendant seeks to strike out the claimant’s claim under Order 9 r 16(1)(a)–(c) of the Rules of Court 2021 (“ROC 2021”) on two main grounds:

> (a)     First, pursuant to section 44(1) of the Act, the claimant has no _locus standi_ or cause of action because it did not use the relevant form prescribed by the Estate Agents (Estate Agency Work) Regulations 2010 (the “2010 Regulations”).[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> (b)     Second, pursuant to section 66(1) of the Act read with regulation 5(1) and the Third Schedule of the 2011 Regulations, the Courts are not the appropriate forum to adjudicate the claimant’s claim. The claimant is required to participate in the dispute resolution schemes of the defendant’s choice which, in this case, is mediation and/or arbitration under the CEA’s dispute resolution schemes.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

9       The claimant opposes the present application for two reasons:

> (a)     Section 44(1)(a) of the Act allows parties to deviate, by agreement, from the relevant prescribed form. On the facts, the parties had agreed to deviate from the relevant prescribed form. Ms Tjoa had initially prepared a commission agreement in accordance with the relevant prescribed form, and had forwarded it to the defendant on 15 September 2021 for her execution. However, the defendant, who was also a salesperson, informed Ms Tjoa over a phone call that she wanted a simple commission agreement, not exceeding one page, which contained only certain terms, and that she would surely make payment of the commission and the remainder of the terms would not be necessary (the “Alleged Representations”). Ms Tjoa acceded to the defendant’s request and eventually prepared the Agreement which was executed by the parties.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> (b)     In any event, the defendant is, by reason of the Alleged Representations, estopped from denying the validity of the Agreement.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

10     The defendant denies that Ms Tjoa had sent her a commission agreement prepared in accordance with the relevant prescribed form on 15 September 2021, and that the parties had agreed to deviate from the prescribed form at her request.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) In the defendant’s affidavit in support of the present application, she claims that she only became aware that the Agreement contravened the Act and its subsidiary legislation after being advised by her lawyers of the same.[^9]

## Legal principles governing striking out applications

11     Under Order 9 r 16(1) of ROC 2021, the Court may order any or part of any pleading to be struck out or amended, on the ground that:

> (a)     it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence;

> (b)     it is an abuse of process of the Court; or

> (c)     it is in the interests of justice to do so.

12     As the grounds for striking out in Order 9 r 16(1)(a) and (b) mirror Order 18 r 19(1)(a) and (d) of the Rules of Court 2014 (“ROC 2014”), existing caselaw on the latter provisions remains relevant in illuminating the threshold for striking out claims under Order 9 r 16(1)(a) and (b).

13     Thus, where an application is made under Order 9 r 16(1)(a), a claim should be struck out only if upon examination of the allegations in the pleadings, the alleged cause of action is certain to fail: see Jeffrey Pinsler, SC, Singapore Civil Practice Volume 1 (LexisNexis, 2022) (the “Black Book 2022”) at \[24-11\] and \[24-14\], citing among others _Gabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 649</span> (“_Gabriel Peter_”) at \[21\]. No evidence is admissible on an application made under this ground: see Order 9 r 16(2). Claims without legal basis, the absence of, or major defects in, the particulars of pleadings, and pleadings which are insufficiently certain to establish a legal basis, would fall under this ground: see the Black Book 2022 at \[24-18\] and \[24-21\].

14     Order 9 r 16(1)(b) entitles the Court to use its summary power in circumstances where there has been an improper use of the court process. Examples in caselaw of such improper use include the bringing of an action for a collateral purpose or in circumvention of legislative requirements which the claimant had to fulfil: see the Black Book 2022 at \[24-44\] – \[24-48\], citing among others _Gabriel Peter_ at \[22\] and _Abdul Razak Ahmad v Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 MLJ 287</span>.

15     Order 9 r 16(1)(b) is wide enough to encompass Order 18 r 19(1)(b) (i.e. scandalous, frivolous or vexatious pleadings) and Order 18 r 19(1)(c) (i.e. pleadings that may prejudice, embarrass or delay a fair trial) of ROC 2014. Caselaw on these two limbs of Order 18 r 19(1) will therefore continue to be relevant: see the Black Book 2022 at \[24-30\]. Thus, this ground would cover claims which are obviously unsustainable, whether legally and/or factually. A claim is legally unsustainable where it is clear as a matter of law that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts he seeks to prove, he will not be entitled to the remedy he seeks. A claim is factually unsustainable where the factual basis for the claim is fanciful because it is entirely without substance: see the Black Book 2022 at \[24-31\], citing among others _The ‘Bunga Melati 5’_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 546</span>.

16     Order 9 r 16(1)(c), on the other hand, is a new provision in ROC 2021 which has no precedent in Order 18 r 19 of the ROC 2014. It is residuary in nature and intended to empower the Court to strike out an action if this outcome is necessary to achieve the interests of justice. This ground overlaps with the grounds under Order 19 r 16(1)(a) and (b) as those subparagraphs provide specific instances of when a pleading or part of it operates contrary to the interests of justice: see the Black Book 2022 at \[24-113\].

## Whether the claimant has no _locus standi_ or cause of action because it did not use the relevant form prescribed by the 2010 Regulations

### The relevant statutory provisions

17     The material portions of section 44 of the Act are reproduced below:[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

> “**Estate agency agreement required as regards certain proposals and undertakings**

> **44.—(1**)     **Subject to subsection (4), where an estate** agent proposes or **undertakes (whether for a commission or other fee or not) to perform estate agency work** for a client, whether as regards a particular property or not, **a right or other cause of action whereby agreed sums**, damages or any other relief or remedy **may be recovered or obtained in legal proceedings** as regards the proposal or undertaking **shall lie at the suit of the estate agent if, and only if** —

>> (a)     **an estate agency agreement** embodying the terms of the proposal or undertaking, being an agreement between the estate agent and the client which is **in the form prescribed and which contains such particulars (if any) in respect of the proposal or undertaking as are prescribed** for the purposes of this section **has been entered into** **and, in the case of a written document, properly executed**; and

>> (b)    the estate agent was a licensed estate agent at the time when the estate agency agreement was so entered into and executed.

> (2)    Subject to subsection (4), where an estate agent makes a proposal or gives an undertaking to perform estate agency work for a client as described in subsection (1), the agent shall be entitled to recover from, or to require the payment by any other person of, any amount in respect of any outgoing paid or payable by the agent as regards any acquisition or disposition of any property to which the proposal or undertaking relates if, and only if —

>> (a)    an estate agency agreement between the estate agent and the client which is in the prescribed form and contains, in respect of the proposal or undertaking, such particulars (if any) as are prescribed for the purposes of this section has been entered into and, in the case of a written document, properly executed;

>> (b)    the estate agency agreement expressly provides for such recovery or reimbursement; and

>> (c)    the estate agent was a licensed estate agent at the time when the estate agency agreement was so entered into and executed.

> …

> (**4**)     **Regulations made under section 72 may exclude any class or description of estate agency work from the operation of subsections (1) and (2).**

> (my emphasis)

18     For the sale of residential property, the prescribed forms of estate agency agreement (referenced in sections 44(1)(a) and 44(2)(a)) are set out in Regulations 10(1)(a) and (2)(a) of the 2010 Regulations. These provisions state that the agreement shall either be in Form 1 (Estate agency agreement for the sale of residential property) or Form 5 (Exclusive estate agency agreement for the sale of residential property) of the Third Schedule of the 2010 Regulations.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

19     Section 44(4) provides that regulations may be made to exclude any class of estate agency work from the operation of sections 44(1) and (2). Regulation 11 of the 2010 Regulations in turn sets out the scenarios which are excluded from the operation of sections 44(1) and (2):[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> “Section 44(1) and (2) of the Act shall not apply to any estate agency work —

>> (a)    in respect of property situated outside Singapore;

>> (b)    in respect of commercial or industrial property;

>> (c)    in respect of any actual or proposed collective sale of property under the provisions of Part VA of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap. 158);

>> (d)    in respect of any actual or proposed sale by a developer of property developed by the developer pursuant to a licence issued under the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act (Cap. 130); and

>> (e)    which is not expressly excluded by paragraphs (a) to (d) and for which there is no prescribed agreement under regulation 10.”

### The parties’ dispute over the applicability of section 44(1) of the Act

20     The defendant submits, based on the plain wording of section 44(1) of the Act and Parliament’s intention behind the section, that the section clearly operates to bar the claimant’s claim since it is undisputed that:

> (a)     the claimant is a licensed estate agent at the time the Agreement was concluded;

> (b)     the defendant is a “client”, which is defined in section 3 of the Act to include “_any person who … retains or otherwise uses the services of, or otherwise engages or employs, an estate agent, whether directly or through a salesperson_”;

> (c)     the work performed by the claimant under the Agreement is “estate agency work”, which is defined in section 3 of the Act to include “_any work done in the course of business for a client … (a) being work done in relation to the introduction to the client of a third person who wishes to acquire or dispose of a property …”_;

> (d)     none of the scenarios listed in regulation 11 of the 2010 Regulations (which are excluded from the operation of sections 44(1) and (2)) apply in the present case; and

> (e)     the Agreement is not in the relevant prescribed form, namely Form 1 or Form 5.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) Among other things, the Agreement does not contain (i) the duties of the estate agent set out in Schedule 2 of Form 1 or 5, or (ii) the dispute resolution clauses in Clause 9 of Form 1 or Clause 11 of Form 5, which require parties to resolve any dispute arising from the agreement through the CEA’s dispute resolution schemes.

21     The claimant does not challenge the matters set out at \[20(a)-(e)\] above. However, the claimant contends that the phrase “_and, in the case of a written document, properly executed”_ in section 44(1)(a) (the “Underlined Phrase”) permits parties to deviate, by agreement, from the relevant prescribed form. This is because the word “document” has a meaning that is much wider and does not refer to any of the prescribed forms. The claimant submits that since the parties had agreed to deviate from the relevant prescribed form and to enter into the Agreement, the claimant is not precluded under section 44(1) from bringing this action.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

22     The defendant disagrees with the claimant’s proposed interpretation. The defendant submits that the Underlined Phrase merely provides that insofar as the parties enter into a written estate agency agreement in the prescribed form, that agreement must be properly executed, i.e. in accordance with the requisite formalities for the execution of written contracts.

### The proper meaning of section 44(1) of the Act

23     In determining the proper meaning of section 44(1), I am guided by the approach to statutory interpretation laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Tan Cheng Bock v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 850</span> at \[54\]:

> (a)     Section 9A of the Interpretation Act mandates the purposive approach to statutory interpretation.

> (b)     The Court must start by ascertaining the possible interpretations of the provision, having regard not just to its text but also to its context within the statute (in which it is situated) as a whole.

> (c)     The Court must then ascertain the legislative purpose or object of the provision and the part of the statute in which it is situated. The Court then compares the possible interpretations of the provision against the purpose of the relevant part of the statute. The interpretation which furthers the purpose of the written text should be preferred to the interpretation which does not.

> (d)     In this regard, it may be necessary to distinguish between the specific purpose of the provision in question, and the general purpose of the part of the statute in which the provision is found. If the general purpose sheds no light on the object of the specific provision, it may be necessary to examine the specific purpose separately.

> (e)     The purpose should ordinarily be gleaned from the text itself. The court must first determine the ordinary meaning of the provision in its context, which might give sufficient indication of the objects and purposes of the provision, before evaluating whether consideration of extraneous material is necessary.

> (f)     Consideration of extraneous material may only be had in three situations:

>> (i)       If the ordinary meaning of the provision (taking into account its context in the statute and purpose or object underlying the statute) is clear, extraneous material can only be used to confirm the ordinary meaning but not to alter it.

>> (ii)       If the provision is ambiguous or obscure on its face, extraneous material can be used to ascertain the meaning of the provision.

>> (iii)       If the ordinary meaning of the provision (taking into account its context in the statute and the purpose or object underlying the statute) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, extraneous material can be used to ascertain the meaning of the provision.

> (g)     In deciding whether to consider extraneous material, and if so what weight to place on it, the Court should have regard to the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the statute and the purpose or object underlying the statute); and the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage. The Court should also have regard to:

>> (i)       whether the material is clear and unequivocal;

>> (ii)       whether it discloses the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention underlying the statutory provision; and

>> (iii)       whether it is directed to the very point of statutory interpretation in dispute.

24     Applying this approach, I find that section 44(1) does not permit parties to deviate, by agreement, from the relevant prescribed form. Section 44(1) confers a licensed estate agent the right to seek relief in legal proceedings in respect of its undertaking to perform estate agency work for a client, **only if**:

> (a)     the agreement embodying the terms of the undertaking is in the relevant form prescribed under the 2010 Regulations; **and**

> (b)     the said agreement has been properly executed, meaning that it complies with the requisite formalities for the execution of written contracts.

25     The only exceptions to the operation of section 44(1) are the scenarios set out in regulation 11(4) of the 2010 Regulations.

26     I reach this conclusion for two reasons.

#### The text of section 44(1) and its context within the Act

27     First, when one has regard to the text of section 44(1) and its context within the Act, section 44(1) only admits of one ordinary meaning, namely that which I have set out above.

28     It is clear from the word “and” in the Underlined Phrase that the two requirements set out in section 44(1)(a) – _first_, the estate agency agreement must be in the prescribed form and _second_, the said agreement must be properly executed – are cumulative. Hence, both requirements must be met in order for the estate agent to have the right to seek relief in legal proceedings in respect of its undertaking to perform estate agency work. If Parliament had intended for the two requirements to be alternatives and the second requirement to be an exception to the first requirement (as the claimant now suggests), one would have expected that to be clearly conveyed through the text of section 44(1)(a), for example, by substituting the Underlined Phrase with the words italicised and underlined below:

> “(a)  an estate agency agreement embodying the terms of the proposal or undertaking, being an agreement between the estate agent and the client which is in the form prescribed and which contains such particulars (if any) in respect of the proposal or undertaking as are prescribed for the purposes of this section has been entered into ~and, in the case of a written document, properly executed~ _or, in the case where parties agree to depart from the form and particulars prescribed, a written estate agency agreement embodying the terms of the proposal or undertaking has been properly executed_;”

29     Furthermore, sections 44(1) and (2) both begin with the phrase “Subject to subsection (4)”. Section 44(4) in turn points to the making of regulations to exclude certain scenarios from the operation of sections 44(1) and (2). This shows that the exceptions to the requirement in sections 44(1) and (2) to comply with the relevant prescribed form, are to be found only in the regulations to the Act. In this regard, regulation 11(4) of the 2010 Regulations comprehensively sets out the scenarios which are excluded from the operation of section 44(1) and (2): see \[19\] above. None of those scenarios include the parties’ agreement to deviate from the relevant prescribed form.

30     The definition of the term “estate agency agreement” in section 3 of the Act also supports my interpretation of section 44(1). The term “estate agency agreement” is defined to mean “_one or more_ **_written documents_** _embodying the terms agreed for the time being between an estate agent and a client of such agent being terms on and subject to which estate agency work is done by such agent for the client_” (my emphasis). The reference in this definition to “written documents” mirrors the use of the words “written document” in the Underlined Phrase. This suggests that the Underlined Phrase is simply intended to reinforce that an estate agency agreement in the relevant prescribed form, which would be in writing, must be properly executed in order to confer on the estate agent the right to sue on the agreement.

31     Turning to the context of section 44(1) within the Act:

> (a)     the section is situated in Part IV of the Act titled “Duties and Liabilities”, which sets out the duties and liabilities of licensed estate agents and salespersons; and

> (b)     the section is titled “Estate agency agreement required as regards certain proposals and undertakings”.

32     Nothing in the said context is inconsistent with my interpretation of section 44(1).

#### The legislative purpose of section 44

33     Second, the legislative purpose of section 44 of the Act confirms my interpretation of section 44(1)(a).

34     During the Second Reading of the Estate Agents Bill (Bill No. 19/2010) (the “Bill”), Mr Mah Bow Tan, then the Minister for National Development, explained the rationale of section 44 as follows:

> “**We have received feedback from consumers that there are unfair clauses in some of the estate agency agreements** such as the auto-extension of the exclusivity period in the exclusive agreement to sell a property. **To protect consumers from such clauses, CEA will be empowered to prescribe standard agency agreements for property transactions**. I would like to clarify that these agreements are those between the consumer and the agent, and not those between the buyer and seller, or landlord or tenant.”[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> “… To address Assoc. Prof Straughan’s suggestion to consult the public: yes, the standard agreement has gone through many rounds of consultation with the industry players and with consumer associations like CASE; in fact, **we have been cooking this whole Bill for more than a year and the standard agency agreement was one of the things that everybody agreed was a good thing to have. It will allow for add-on clauses, it will allow for other flexibilities that do not contradict the prescribed clauses of the agreement. Our main intention is to protect the consumer**, and we will endeavour to do so as much as possible without micro-managing the industry as Mr Lim Biow Chuan mentioned just now.”[^16]

> (my emphasis)

35     Furthermore, the Explanatory Statement to the Bill describes Section 44 as follows:

> “Clause 44 provides for estate agency agreements between estate agents and their clients. **An estate agent who performs estate agency work without the required agreement will not be able to recover any fees or seek any remedy in legal proceedings. Regulations may exclude any class or description of estate agency work from the operation of this clause.”** (my emphasis)

36     The abovementioned authorities make it clear that:

> (a)     Parliament’s intention behind the requirement in section 44 to use the relevant prescribed form, is to protect consumers from the presence of unfair clauses in estate agency agreements;

> (b)     such protection is granted by prescribing **mandatory** contents for such agreements, which **must** be adhered to in order for the estate agent to recover fees or seek any remedies under the agreement (my emphasis);

> (c)     the scenarios (if any) in which such protection will not apply (“Exclusions”), will be set out in regulations.

37     There is no mention in the parliamentary debates on the Bill, or the Explanatory Statement to the Bill, that parties’ agreement to deviate from the relevant prescribed form is an exception to the requirement in sections 44(1) and (2) to comply with such forms. On the contrary, Minister Mah’s explanation set out in \[34\] above leaves it beyond doubt that what parties can agree on is to add to (as opposed to subtract from) the relevant prescribed form, provided that the additional clauses do not contradict the prescribed clauses in the form. This restriction is also reflected in the notes to Clause 10 of Form 1 and Clause 12 of Form 5, which provide that:[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

> “**The printed terms prescribed in this form of Agreement cannot be deleted or varied**. If the parties wish at any time to agree to or add on any other terms, they must be in writing, dated, inserted as Additional Terms below and initialed by the parties … **The Additional Terms cannot conflict with, vary or otherwise limit the prescribed terms of this Agreement**” (my emphasis).

38     In the premises, the legislative purpose of section 44 confirms that there is no room to deviate from the relevant prescribed form by the agreement of parties, unless one of the scenarios listed in regulation 11(4) of the 2010 Regulations applies (which is not the case here).

### The claimant’s estoppel argument

39     As mentioned above, the claimant’s alternative submission is that the defendant is estopped from denying the validity of the Agreement by reason of the Alleged Representations, which the claimant had relied upon to its detriment by concluding the Agreement and performing services thereunder. I am unable to accept this submission for two reasons.

40     First, the only evidence adduced by the defendant in support of the Alleged Representations are:

> (a)     Ms Tjoa’s assertions in her affidavit that these representations were made;[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) and

> (b)     a completed Form 5 which Ms Tjoa had allegedly forwarded to the defendant via WeChat on 15 September 2021, but without any supporting evidence that the said form was in fact transmitted to the defendant over WeChat.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19)

41     Unfortunately, such limited evidence at this interlocutory stage is insufficient to discharge the claimant’s burden of proving, on the balance of probabilities, that the defendant had made the Alleged Representations.

42     Second, through its estoppel argument, the claimant is essentially seeking to circumvent the operation of section 44(1) of the Act and to enforce the Agreement on the basis of the defendant’s alleged agreement, communicated to the claimant, to deviate from the relevant prescribed form. In light of my views above on the proper meaning of section 44(1), I do not think the claimant can be permitted to do so, even if the Alleged Representations were in fact made.

## Conclusion

43     Given that the Agreement does not comply with Form 1 or Form 5, the claimant is, by reason of section 44(1) of the Act, precluded from obtaining any relief under the Agreement in legal proceedings. In the premises, I strike out the claimant’s claim under Order 9 r 16(1)(a)–(c) on the ground that it is legally unsustainable. It is unnecessary for me to further decide whether the Courts are the appropriate forum to adjudicate the claimant’s claim.

44     At this juncture, I pause to acknowledge that my decision to strike out the claimant’s claim may appear to be unduly harsh. However, I am constrained to give effect to section 44(1) which, in my view, clearly provides that non-compliance with the relevant prescribed form precludes the estate agent from recovering any relief in respect of its undertaking to perform estate agency work, except in the scenarios set out in regulation 11 of the 2010 Regulation.

45     Furthermore, I do not think the claimant’s inability to sue on the Agreement necessarily means that it is left without any recourse against the defendant. If the claimant is able to establish a cause of action against the defendant without having to rely directly on the Agreement (for example, in fraudulent misrepresentation or unjust enrichment), it may still be able to recover damages for the losses it suffered in this transaction.

46     On the issue of costs, having heard parties’ submissions, I award the defendant costs of $7,500 (all in) for the suit and the present application.
