### District Judge John Ng:

## Enhanced Sentence under Section 50T Prisons Act

1       Section 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Chapter 247, 2000 Rev Ed) provides as follows:

> “(1)  When a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order made under Division 2 or 3, the court may, **_in addition_** to imposing any sentence on the person for that offence, impose an **_enhanced sentence_** for that offence as follows:

>> (a)    Imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the commission of the offence;”

(emphasis in **_italics_** mine)

2       The present case concerns the principles and approaches to be adopted and the factors to be considered in the calibration of the **enhanced sentence** under s50T(1)(a)[^1].

#### The Brief Facts

3       The Offender is Mohamad Dom Bin Matsaad (hereinafter referred to as “Dom”). On 5 January 2019, Dom and Mohamad Zaino Bin Toha (“Zaino”) were involved in an affray, arising from a misunderstanding between them. Dom had agreed to accompany Zaino to his workplace as it was Zaino’s first day at work as a laundry worker. Dom was required to be present at the workplace because he had recommended Zaino for the job. Unfortunately, Dom had overslept and did not turn up for the appointment. That night, Zaino confronted Dom and demanded an explanation. Dom explained that he had overslept but Zaino did not believe him and accused him of lying. A fracas transpired and they exchanged pushes and punches. Both of them were charged in court for committing the offence of Affray under s276B of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed)(“Penal Code”).

#### The Sentence

4       Dom pleaded guilty before me and was convicted accordingly for the single offence of Affray. He was sentenced to **one week’s imprisonment** for the offence. Since Dom was subjected to a Remission Order made by the Commissioner of Prisons and sentenced to imprisonment by me for an offence which had been committed during the period of remission, he was **liable to be given an additional term of imprisonment as an enhanced sentence**.

5       Having carefully considered the objectives of the Conditional Remission System that introduced the enhanced sentence, the rationale for the imposition of an enhanced sentence under s50T(1)(a) and the various factors to be taken into account in s50T(3), an **enhanced sentence of 30 days** was imposed, to run consecutively (as mandated by s50T(5)) to the **sentence of one week’s imprisonment** for the offence of Affray.

## The Oral Grounds for the Enhanced Sentence

6       I had given the following Oral Grounds on the day of imposing the sentence for the Affray offence and the enhanced sentence _for breaching the basic condition_ of the Remission Order:

> “1.    This case touches on the sentencing of persons subject to the Conditional Remission System (“CRS”), who went on to commit an offence during the remission period. By committing an offence during the remission period, the person would have breached the basic condition of the Conditional Remission Order. If the person is sentenced to a custodial sentence (_i.e._ imprisonment, reformative training, corrective training or preventive detention) for that offence, the sentencing Court may impose an additional sentence of imprisonment on the offender. In the Conditional Remission Order, this additional sentence is termed as the “enhanced sentence”. The maximum length of the enhanced sentence is the length of the remaining remission period after the new offence was committed.

> 2.    The Singapore Prisons Service implemented the CRS in 2014. When a prisoner has served the requisite portion (presently set at the two-third mark) of his sentence, he shall be released (if he had not breached prison discipline) for the remainder of his sentence under a Conditional Remission Order issued by the Commissioner of Prisons. The remaining portion of the unserved sentence is suspended.

> 3.    In this case, the prisoner Mohamad Dom Bin Matsaad (“Dom”) was issued a Conditional Remission Order (under Section 50I(1)(a) of the Prisons Act, Chapter 247, Rev Ed 2000 (“the Act”)) on 3 December 2018 and released from prison on that day. Under the terms of the Conditional Remission Order, the remaining portion of his sentence from 3 December 2018 to 22 December 2020, a period of just over 2 years, was suspended. He was placed on CRS for the offences of LT1 drug consumption, Voluntarily causing hurt and Failure to report for urine test.

> 4.    On 5 January 2019, Dom got into a sudden unpremeditated fight with Mr Mohamad Zaino Bin Toha (“Zaino”), a fellow resident of the halfway house (Selarang Halfway House) they were staying in. Both of them were staying there under the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme. On that day, Dom was supposed to accompany Zaino to his new workplace. It was Zaino’s first day at work as a laundry worker. Dom was the one who had recommended Zaino to work at that place and was therefore required to be present with Zaino. However, Dom had overslept and did not turn up.

> 5.    Later that same day, Zaino confronted Dom and both of them got into a fight. That was how both of them came to be charged for the offence of Affray. Zaino pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment for the offence of Affray.

> 6.    The Court, the Prosecution and the Defence in this case are generally of the view that an imprisonment term of one week is also the appropriate sentence for Dom, mainly on the basis of the Parity Principle. Furthermore, Dom has criminal records for offences of violence. A fine would not be a sufficient sentence. The sentence of imprisonment of one week is justified on the sentencing principle of specific deterrence as well as for the reason that there were serious injuries suffered by the other party to the affray. A short custodial sentence is warranted in view of the significant harm caused in the affray.

> 7.    Moving on to the calibration of the enhanced sentence under the CRS. This case involved one _Breaching Offence_ (referring to the **Affray** offence) and three _Remission Offences_ (referring to the **LT1 drug consumption (“LT1”)** offence, **Voluntarily causing hurt (“VCH”)** and **Failing to report for urine test**, as reflected at Paragraph 4 of the latest Summary Sheet dated 24 October 2019 prepared by the Singapore Prison Service). Based on the Summary Sheet, Dom is liable for up to 713 days of enhanced sentence. The bulk of the remission duration is attributable to the period of remission for the **LT1** offence. The sentence of imprisonment for the **LT1** offence was 5 years and 6 months _i.e._ 66 months. The remission period for the **LT1** sentence would be 22 months. The sentence imposed for the **VCH** offence was an imprisonment of 8 months. The remission period for the **VCH** sentence would be 2.7 months.

> 8.    The Prosecution has initially submitted for an enhanced sentence of imprisonment of 237 days (the equivalent of about 8 months) based on a framework of sentencing bands. It was then revised to 177 days (which is about 6 months) to pay heed to the totality principle. In the Prosecution’s 3rd and final submissions on sentence dated 11 November 2019, based on a Proposed Sentencing Approach instead of the sentencing bands framework, the number of days to be imposed under Section 50T(1)(a) of the Act was calibrated at 77 days (or 2.5 months). This approach of the Prosecution is for a situation when the total remission period consisted of components from different offences under remission (as in the present case):

>> (a)    identify the different portions that make up the full remaining duration of the remission period based on the nature of the offences: Section 50T(3)(b) of the Act (_Paragraph 13 of PP’s submissions of 11 November 2019_);

>> (b)    derive the notional unexpired term of imprisonment for the similar offence for which the offender was originally sentenced. This can be derived by applying the proportion of the sentence received for that similar offence to the remaining duration of the remission order (_Paragraph 14 of PP’s submissions of 11 November 2019_);

>> (c)    adjust the notional starting point upwards or downwards by considering other factors listed in Section 50T(3)(a),(c) & (d) of the Act (_Paragraph 16 of PP’s submissions of 11 November 2019_).

> I found this approach suitable to be applied to the present case but the calibrated enhanced sentence of 77 days’ imprisonment has to be adjusted downwards to take into account the full circumstances of this case.

> 9.    I had previously indicated to the Prosecution that I would not give any significant weight to the **LT1** sentence simply because it is an entirely different type of offence from the breaching offence of **Affray**. This would be in line with Section 50T(3)(b) of the Act which requires the court to consider whether the breaching offence is of a similar nature to the remission offence. **Affray** is an offence of violence disturbing the public peace. The commission of the **Affray** was not drug-related and the offence did not in any way show Dom returning to drugs or taking for granted his remission for the drug offences. The Prosecution had taken this indication on board and revised their calibration from 177 days to 77 days accordingly.

> 10.    On the other hand, the offence of **Affray** is similar in nature to the **VCH** offence for which Dom was sentenced to 8 months. The proportion of the remaining duration of the remission period attributable to the **VCH** sentence is 77 days. \[_Calculation: (8 months out of the total sentence of 74 months) multiplied by the remaining length of remission duration of 713 days i.e. (8 divided by 74) multiplied by 713._\]

> 11.    Being similar in nature, it would be reasonable to peg the enhanced sentence at 77 days as a starting point. However, it is recognized by the Prosecution that **Affray** is generally an offence of lesser gravity than an offence of **VCH**. **Affray** is punishable with up to one year’s imprisonment while **VCH** is punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment _i.e._ twice the maximum punishment for **Affray**. Therefore, an adjustment downwards is to be made.

> 12.    Bearing in mind that the **VCH** sentence was 8 months long and the sentence to be passed for the **Affray** offence is one week, a substantial downward adjustment of the enhanced sentence is only fair. Section 50T(3)(a) of the Act stipulated that the court shall consider the gravity of the breaching offence. A downward adjustment of more than half of the 77 days proposed by the Prosecution would be in order.

> 13.    Furthermore, the background for the fighting incident between both of them was one that arose out of a situation in which both offenders were trying to mend their ways. Dom had overslept, causing Zaino to be unhappy for being stood up in relation to the recommended job. I would consider the background for the offence of **Affray** to be relevant under Section 50T(3)(d) of the Act. In the light of these circumstances, an enhanced sentence of 30 days would be more than adequate to meet the objectives of CRS and the purpose of the punishment under s50T(1)(a) of the Act.

> 14.    The Prosecution had submitted that there ought to be an upward adjustment of the 77 days in view of the fact that Dom had committed the offence of **Affray** very soon after he was given the remission order under CRS, a mere 33 days after his release. The DPP then took into account that this upward adjustment is balanced by the downward adjustment under the gravity limb reflecting the minor nature of the **Affray** offence and therefore the enhanced sentence calibrated by the Prosecution is 77 days.

> 15.    I am of the view that there should not be any upward adjustment as the factor of time had been accounted for at the First stage of the Prosecution’s Proposed Sentencing Approach at Paragraphs 13 to 15 of PP’s Sentencing Submissions of 11 November 2019. In arriving at the calibration of 77 days, the Prosecution had already factored in the commission of the offence of **Affray** on 5 January 2019, which was 33 days after his release from prison on 3 December 2018. If Dom had committed the offence later, the calibration period would have been lower and _vice versa_.

> _Sentence_ :

> 16.    After considering all the relevant factors for this case and the comprehensive submissions by both the Deputy Public Prosecutor and Defence Counsel, the sentence for the **Affray** offence under the Penal Code is one week's imprisonment and the enhanced sentence under Section 50T(1)(a) of the Act is an imprisonment term of 30 days.”

7       To be able to impose the **enhanced sentence** created by s50T(1)(a) correctly, we need to have a working understanding of the Conditional Remission System and the objectives in mind.

## The Conditional Remission System

8        **Part VB** of the Prisons Act provides for the **Remission of Sentences**.

#### The objectives of the Conditional Remission System

9       The purposes of the remission of sentences are spelt out in s50E(1) as follows:

> “This Part makes provision for the remission of sentences for the purpose of –

>> (a)    encouraging good conduct and industry by prisoners who are serving their sentences; and

>> (b)    facilitating the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration into society.”

10     Section 50I stipulates, _inter alia_, that the Commissioner of Prisons shall make a remission order when a prisoner has served two-thirds of all the consecutive terms of imprisonment to which the prisoner was sentenced. It is also provided _inter alia_ under s50K(1)(a) that where a remission order is made under s50I, the remainder of the prisoner’s sentence **_shall be suspended_**.

11     At the Second Reading of the Prisons (Amendment) Bill on 20 January 2014, the then Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs Mr Masagos Zulkifli stated that the Bill amends the Prisons Act to introduce the Conditional Remission System and the Mandatory Aftercare Scheme. On the Conditional Remission System (“CRS”), he said:

> “Let me touch on the objective of the CRS. Our remission system has not changed since the mid-1950s when Singapore was a British Colony. Currently, inmates are granted one-third remission for good conduct and behaviour in prison, that is, if they have not breached prison discipline. There are no conditions imposed upon their release. In contrast, many jurisdictions have moved away from their colonial precedents. The UK and its former colonies like Canada, New Zealand, and Hong Kong have, over time, implemented parole or conditional release systems that impose conditions on inmates when they are released. This creates the incentive for good behaviour upon release. Drawing upon the best practices in other jurisdictions, Singapore will be introducing the CRS. The CRS seeks to deter ex-inmates from re-offending by subjecting them to conditions upon their release. All inmates will be subject to the CRS upon release.”[^2]

12     Before the implementation of the CRS, prisoners could expect that they would have completed their terms of imprisonment after serving two-thirds of their sentence. The remaining one-third of their sentence **_shall be remitted_** and the prisoners would be released **_unconditionally_**. After the implementation of the CRS, the remaining one-third of their sentence **_shall be suspended_** (see s50K(1)(a)) and the prisoner shall be given a remission order. Pursuant to s50S, all remission orders are subject to the _basic condition_.

#### The mechanics of the Remission Order

13     In every remission order granted by the Commissioner of Prisons under s50I, the following can be found in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3:

> “**Grant of remission**

> The Commissioner of Prisons hereby makes this remission order in accordance with Section 50I of the Prisons Act upon you having served the required portion of your sentence. The remaining portion of your sentence from (_the date of release from prison_) to (_the date of the last day of the remission period_) is suspended and is also the period during which this remission order is in effect.

> **Basic condition of remission order**

> 2.    While this remission order is in effect, you must comply with the following basic condition in accordance with Section 50S of the Prisons Act:

>> You –

>>> (a)    must not commit any offence (not including an offence of committing a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition of this remission order) while this remission order is in effect; and

>>> (b)    must not be convicted of that offence and sentenced to any of the following:

>>>> (i)    a sentence of imprisonment (not including a default sentence imposed for failure to pay a fine);

>>>> (ii)   corrective training;

>>>> (iii)   reformative training;

>>>> (iv)   preventive detention.

> **Breach of Basic Condition**

> 3.    If you breach the basic condition as stated in paragraph 2, you may be given an enhanced sentence by the Court in addition to any punishment given for the offence stated in paragraph 2. The duration of the enhanced sentence will be determined by the Court, but it will not exceed the remaining duration of this remission order at the date the offence was committed.”

14     The above three paragraphs, contained in every standard remission order issued to all prisoners placed on the CRS, are drafted based on s50S. Section 50S(1) provides as follows:

> “(1)  It is the basic condition of every remission order made under Division 2 or 3 that the person released under the remission order –

>> (a)    shall not commit any offence (not including an offence under section 50Y(1)) while the remission order is in effect; and

>> (b)    shall not be convicted of that offence and sentenced to any of the following:

>>> (i)    a sentence of imprisonment (not including a default sentence);

>>> (ii)   corrective training;

>>> (iii)   reformative training;

>>> (iv)   preventive detention.”

15     Where there is a breach of this **basic condition**, it is provided for in s50S(2) as follows:

> “(2)  Where a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order, he shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition on the date of the commission of the offence.”

16     It is timely at this point to understand the phrase “enhanced sentence” as coined in the Prisons Act. At first blush, the phrase gives the impression of imposing a higher or longer sentence for the Breaching Offence (_i.e_. the offence of Affray in this case) which was committed within the remission period. That is an erroneous impression and it is vital to bear this in mind. The enhanced sentence is not additional punishment for the Breaching Offence but rather it is a sanction for the _breach of the basic condition_ of the remission order. This is a very important distinction. Bearing this in mind would avoid confusion in applying the appropriate principles and obviate conflation in assessing the factors in s50T(3) that the court shall consider in deciding whether to impose any enhanced sentence and the length of the enhanced sentence.

17     In deciding _whether to impose_ an enhanced sentence and _how long_ that **additional sentence** should be, the court has to embark on a distinct and separate exercise of its sentencing discretion to impose a sanction for the breach of the basic condition. This is distinct and different from that of determining the punishment for the offence committed during remission.

18     As stated in the Oral Grounds, the phrase “Breaching Offence” refers to the offence committed during the period of remission resulting in a breach of the basic condition of the remission order. To refer to the offence for which a prisoner had been sentenced and was placed on conditional remission, the phrase I had used is “Remission Offence”. In the present case, the Remission Offences were the **LT1 drug consumption (“LT1”)** offence, the offence for **Voluntarily causing hurt (“VCH”)** and the **Failing to report for urine test** offence.

## Determination of the Enhanced Sentence

19     The commission of an offence during the remission period results in a breach of the basic condition of the remission order. It is crucial to note that the calibration of the “enhanced sentence” requires the judge to embark on an additional sentencing exercise that is distinct from deciding the sentence for the Breaching Offence, in this case the offence of Affray. This distinct and separate sentencing exercise to determine the “enhanced sentence” is specifically for the **_breach of the basic condition_**.

#### Why a distinct and separate sentencing exercise?

20     The determination of the enhanced sentence under section 50T(1)(a) is a distinct and separate sentencing exercise because of the following reasons:

> (a)     There are two decisions to be made in this _enhanced sentencing_ exercise. The second decision contingent upon the first decision. The first decision is whether an enhanced sentence is warranted and the second, if it is warranted, what the length of the enhanced sentence should be.

> (b)     The enhanced sentence is an additional sentence (but not a “new sentence”). It is not a “new sentence” because the court is not called upon to generate a sentence from scratch or from nothing in the first place. Instead, the court is being tasked to decide _how much of the remaining suspended sentence_ ought to be served in prison. The length of the enhanced sentence available to be imposed is limited by the remaining duration of the suspended sentence as at the time of commission of the Breaching Offence. It is _not a fresh punishment_. It is **based** entirely on and limited by a sentence or sentences already passed or set in the past.

> (c)     Section 50T(3) stipulates that the Court shall consider the gravity (of the Breaching Offence), the similarity of the Breaching Offence with the Remission Offence(s), how long the person remained crime-free after being released on remission and all other relevant circumstances in deciding whether to impose any enhanced sentence.

> (d)     By virtue of the stipulations in s50T(3), the sentencing court has to be concerned not only with the nature of the Breaching Offence but also with the Remission Offences for which the person was placed on conditional remission.

> (e)     Even though the general sentencing principles of punishment, deterrence (general and specific), rehabilitation, prevention, protection and retribution are relevant, it is critical that the court pay heed to the objectives of the CRS and the need to safeguard and not undermine the integrity and functioning of the CRS when determining the enhanced sentence.

> (f)     The separate exercise will ensure there is no double-counting of sentencing factors already calibrated into the sentence for the Breaching Offence _per se_.

#### Factors to be considered by the court for the enhanced sentence

21     To look for the factors to be considered in determining the enhanced sentence, the mandatory port of call is s50T(3). Section 50T(3) reads as follows:

> “(3)  In deciding _whether to impose any enhanced sentence_ under subsection (1) or (2) with respect to any offence, and if so _the length of the enhanced sentence_, the court shall consider –

>> (a)    the _gravity_ of the offence;

>> (b)    whether the offence is of a _similar nature_ to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;

>> (c)    the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and

>> (d)    all other relevant circumstances.”

(emphasis in _italics_ mine)

22     As stipulated in s50T(3)(a)-(d), the factors to be taken into account in determining whether to impose an enhanced sentence and the factors to decide on the length of the enhanced sentence are the same. Before examining what each factor means, it is important to bear in mind that the statutory provision does not give any indication as to the weight to be assigned to each of the factors. Let us look at each of the factors in turn.

##### (a)   Gravity of offence

23     The first factor to be considered is the gravity of the offence under s50T(a) _i.e._ the gravity or seriousness of the Breaching Offence. It seems logical to think that the more serious the Breaching Offence, the imperative to impose an enhanced sentence is stronger. What is less obvious would be the reasons why this should be so. Distilling the reasons is vital for a proper and fair calibration of the enhanced sentence. It will be critical for assigning value to the factor and to avoid the unfairness of double-counting of a sentencing factor. Let me illustrate this point with the following hypothetical example:

> Assume a Breaching Offence of Trafficking in a small quantity of heroin was committed by an offender who was under a remission order and his Remission Offence was for the offence of Robbery at Night for which he was sentenced to 3 years of imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. After serving 2 years, he was released under a remission order for the remaining one year of his sentence. Further, assume that he had committed the Breaching Offence merely 6 months after release under the remission order. The court is to decide the enhanced sentence _i.e._ how much of the remaining 6 months of the suspended sentence for the Robbery offence is to be completed in prison.

24     In this hypothetical example, it is obvious that Trafficking in a controlled drug is a grave offence and he is being punished for it with at least 5 years and 5 strokes. The fact that it is a very serious offence cannot be the reason _per se_, or without more, for imposing an enhanced sentence. That would infringe the rule against double-counting. The offender is already being punished for the serious offence of Trafficking. Thus, we need to look at the objectives of the CRS to find the proper reason for imposing an enhanced sentence.

25     Incidentally, the point has to be made and not forgotten that no matter how grave or serious the Breaching Offence is, the enhanced sentence is limited to what is left of the suspended sentence as at the date of the commission of the Breaching Offence. This point reiterates the fact that in calibrating the enhanced sentence, the court is not crafting a “new sentence” to punish additionally for the Breaching Offence but rather to decide on _curtailing the serving of the remainder of the suspended sentence outside prison_.

26     The CRS was structured to provide an _incentive_ for persons to stay crime-free for as long as possible, at least for the duration of the remission period, after being released back into the community, having served two-thirds of their sentences in prison. It operates on a _daily-reducing basis_ of the final-third of the sentences passed by the courts for the Remission offences. Looked at conversely, the **enhanced sentence** serves as a disincentive for persons to re-offend during their remission period. Therefore, a reason for imposing the enhanced sentence must be to send a signal to every person released on remission that it is incumbent upon them to remain crime-free to enjoy the privilege of serving out the last third of their sentences for the Remission Offences outside prison.

27     The commission of an offence by a person during his remission period apparently shows that the freedom extended to that person is being abused instead of being treasured. The period granted for the person to serve his remaining sentence outside the prison gates has turned into a problem instead of an opportunity for rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. The gravity of the Breaching Offence can therefore be a reflection of the poor attitude of that person towards the opportunity given for him to mend his ways and chart a new course away from trouble with the law.

28     The seriousness of the Breaching Offence also provides an indication that the person should no longer be allowed to remain outside prison for the remainder of that sentence as he has shown himself to be a danger to society. In other words, an enhanced sentence for the remainder of the remission period is also warranted to protect others and to prevent further harm from occurring for that remaining period.

29     With reference to the hypothetical example at Paragraph 22, since Drug Trafficking is a very serious offence, how much of the remaining 6 months of the suspended sentence ought to be imposed as an enhanced sentence? Such a specific question cannot be answered at this point as the factor of “gravity” in s50T(3)(a) is only one of the factors to be considered. We need to consider the other factors stipulated in s50T(3)(b), (c) and (d).

##### (b)   Similarity of offence

30     The next factor to be considered under s50T(3)(b) can be referred to simply as the factor of “similarity”. The consideration of this factor requires looking at the nature of the Breaching Offence and the Remission Offence. Like the first factor of gravity, there is no indications as to what aspects of similarity the court should be concerned with and the weight to be assigned to the level of similarity. Must it always mean the greater the similarity, the longer the enhanced sentence?

31     One can only intuitively surmise that if the Breaching Offence is very similar to the Remission Offences, the greater the need to impose an enhanced sentence and the longer the enhanced sentence to be imposed. The Prosecution had submitted that the similarity (of the Breaching Offence and the Remission Offences) confirms in the starkest possible manner that such misbehaviour is characteristic of the offender.[^3]

32     As a start, the court would have to compare the similarity in terms of the general types of offences. It is not as simple as it looks. Do you look at the statute creating the offences and classify them as very similar just because they come under the same Act? For example, it cannot be that all offences under the Road Traffic Act should be seen as similar. Likewise not all offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act are alike, although, it is easier to justify the similarity for drug offences as most, if not all, the offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act are meant to combat the dreaded drug menace. What about broad statutory instruments, like the Penal Code, which covers the whole gamut of criminal activities?

33     In the Penal Code, offences are categorised into _property offences_ such as theft and cheating, _offences against persons_ such as hurt and sexual offences and even offences relating to road traffic accidents. Comparisons based on broad types appear easy enough but the difficulty arises when it comes to offences of the same type under one broad classification and of a different type under another broad classification. For instance, cheating and theft are broadly property offences, but each offence is made up of different elements. One can say cheating and theft offences share the same mental element of dishonesty and classify them as very similar. On the other hand, one could see them as different in nature when looking at the key elements of deception for cheating and deprivation of possession for theft.

34     Thus far, the discussion on the factor of similarity has been restricted to a singular comparison of one Breaching Offence and one Remission Offence. The level of complexity goes up a notch when comparisons have to be made of one Breaching Offence with two and more Remission Offences. The case at hand presents precisely such a problem.

35     The present case is a situation of one Breaching Offence and three Remission Offences, the sentences for two of them being run consecutively. A more detailed analysis of this issue will be given in the later part of this Grounds of Decision under the **Calibration of the Enhanced Sentence** for this case. For now, the points to note would be how to deal with the situation where the Remission Offences are different in nature (_e.g._ a drug offence and an offence of violence) and where the Breaching Offence is only of a violent nature. Does the court ignore the remission period for the drug offence and calibrate the enhanced sentence based only on the remaining period for the offence of violence? This is possible if the sentences for the two different type of offences were running consecutively.

36     What do you do if the sentences were running concurrently and one sentence is longer than the other? (A discussion of such a scenario, giving rise to such a question, is beyond the scope of this Grounds of Decision as it was not necessary for the decision made in this case. Therefore, the question would not be addressed and the parties were not asked to address this point.)

##### (c)   Length of time after release

37     The third factor the court shall consider for an enhanced sentence is that of the length of time after release, to the point of time of commission of the Breaching Offence during the remission period under s50T(3)(c). Actually, this factor is already in-built into the CRS, in that the earlier the person re-offends after release from prison, the length of time available to be imposed will be longer. Conversely, no matter how _grave_ or how _similar_ the Breaching Offence might be to the Remission Offences, if the offence was committed with one week remaining before the end of the remission period, the maximum enhanced sentence can only amount to one week.

##### (d)   All other relevant circumstances

38     The last factor specified in s50T(3)(d) is the catch-all provision stating “all other relevant circumstances”. This provision is of course wide and all-encompassing and would have to be developed as the CRS encounters more cases through the years. For a hypothetical example of this factor, consider the situation of a person who was placed on remission for a drug consumption sentence and subsequently committed theft during the remission period _with the intention to buy drugs_. Before he could buy and consume any drugs, he was arrested and subsequently convicted for theft. In such a situation, it would be reasonable to take into account this circumstance and impose a longer enhanced sentence than for the situation where the theft offence was committed with no link to drugs.

39     From the above discussion of the various factors to be considered by the court, one can see that the sentencing exercise of determining the enhanced sentence is not as simple as it looks. There are two or more offences to be compared and considered _i.e._ at least one Breaching Offence and one Remission Offence. More importantly, in assessing the various factors, primacy must be given to the rationale and objectives of the CRS. Attention has to be paid to the operational aspects before drawing any definitive conclusions.[^4]

40     The last thing to mention about this sentencing exercise is to be alive to the many limitations in imposing and calibrating the length of the enhanced sentence and to pay attention to the Summary Sheet prepared by Prisons. For every case involving enhanced sentencing under s50T(1)(a), a few documents have to be scrutinized. In the Charge for the Breaching Offence, the details of the liability for an enhanced sentence must be specified. These details would include the start and end dates of the remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons and the remaining duration of the remission order as at the date of the commission of the offence. The exact number of days available for the enhanced sentence must also be stated clearly in the charge.

41     A copy of the “Remission Order under Section 50I of the Prisons Act” is submitted to the court, together with a computer-generated CRS Summary Sheet confirming several details such as the start and end date of the remission order, the maximum length of enhanced sentence that could be given, the offence date, the aggregate length of all the enhanced sentences that can be imposed, the aggregate list of offences and sentences for which the remission order was given and any enhanced sentence served over the entire duration of the remission order.

42     The CRS Summary Sheet prepared by Prisons is a very important document as it contains information that the court has to rely upon and take into account, in order to avoid mistakes in the calibration of the enhanced sentence. This is necessary in view of the limits and restrictions placed upon the imposition of the enhanced sentence. Section 50T(2)(b) provides that if a person commits 2 or more offences in breach of the basic condition of his remission order, the aggregate length of all the enhanced sentences shall not exceed the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the earliest offence committed. It is also stipulated in the Summary Sheet that any period of imprisonment served pursuant to recall to prison shall count towards reducing the total enhanced sentence that could be imposed.

## Prosecution’s Submissions & Proposed Frameworks

43     The Summary Sheet as of 23 May 2019 prepared by Prisons for the present case stated that the remaining duration of the remission order for Dom is **718 days**, based on the offence date of 5 January 2019. However, the maximum length of the enhanced sentence that can be imposed in this case was indicated as **713 days** of imprisonment. I directed the DPP to ascertain from Prisons on the discrepancy of 5 days between 718 and 713 days reflected in the Summary Sheet. The DPP then obtained from Prisons another Summary Sheet as of 24 October 2019 and this Summary Sheet[^5] contained the clarification that Dom was recalled to prison for 5 days from 10 to 14 January 2019. Therefore, the 5 days had to be excluded.

#### The Initial Proposed Framework

44     The Prosecution initially submitted an enhanced sentence of **237 days** to be imposed under s50T(1)(a). The DPP proposed a sentencing framework to calibrate the appropriate enhanced sentence as follows:

> (a)     At the first stage, consider the factors under s50T(3)(a)-(c). Based on these factors of _gravity_, _similarity_ and _time_, the case would be placed within a sentencing band. Each band would have the indicative starting points.

> (b)     At the second stage, depending on the presence of “any other relevant circumstances” referred to in s50T(3)(d), the indicative starting sentence would then be adjusted upwards or downwards.

> (c)     In determining the “gravity of the offence” under s50T(3)(a), regard may be given to the punishment which the offence attracts and the anticipated sentence to be passed for the Breaching Offence.

> (d)     In determining the “similarity” of the offences under s50T(3)(b), regard may be given to the “ingredients” of the offences sharing common elements or showing similar propensities.

> (e)     As for the length of time the person did not commit any offence whilst under the remission order, the earlier the person re-offends, the higher the enhanced sentence should be.

45     I raised several points on the initial proposed framework for the DPP to address. The DPP took them on board and revised the proposed enhanced sentence from **237 days** to **177 days**. The reason given for this revision was that the Prosecution recognised that the main bulk of the remaining duration of the remission period was due to the **LT1** sentence, which is dissimilar to the Affray offence committed during the remission period. Therefore, the DPP reduced the proposed enhanced sentence by 60 days.

46     I noted that the Prosecution had reduced the proposed enhanced sentence by 60 days and queried the DPP as to how the reduction of 60 days had been derived. In the absence of an elucidation for the reduction, I asked a broader question of whether the whole of the remission portion for the **LT1** sentence might be properly and fairly disregarded in determining the enhanced sentence to be imposed, since the Affray offence had nothing to do with drugs and was not drug-related.

47     I had also noted that the proposed sentencing bands framework was based on assigning equal weightage to the factors of “gravity”, “similarity” and “time”. I queried if that was a sound proposition.[^6]

#### The Final Proposed Framework

48     The DPP took time to consider the additional points and came up with the Prosecution’s final proposed framework with the following changes to their initial framework:

> (a)     The sentencing bands approach was abandoned. Instead, in a case where an offender had committed an offence whilst under a remission order imposed for multiple offences of different natures, the DPP submitted that it would be appropriate and only fair at the first stage to identify the different portions that make up the full remaining duration of the remission period based on the nature of the offences.

> (b)     The next step in this first stage is to derive the notional starting point for the enhanced sentence. The Prosecution submitted that the starting point should be based on the notional unexpired term of imprisonment for the similar offence for which the offender was originally sentenced.

> (c)     At the second stage, after deriving the notional starting point, the first step is to adjust the notional starting point upwards or downwards by considering the other factors listed in s50T(3)(a), (c) and (d).

49     Applying the above framework to the facts and circumstances of this case, the DPP re-calibrated the proposed enhanced sentence from **177 days** to **77 days**.

50     The figure of **77 days** was effectively the notional starting point derived by applying the proportion of the sentence received for the **VCH** offence to the remaining duration of the remission order _i.e_. (8/74 months) x 713 days. (“8” refers to the 8 months’ imprisonment for the **VCH** offence and “74” refers to the global sentence of 74 months for the offences of **LT1** and **VCH**. These two sentences had been ordered to run consecutively.)

## Court’s Approach in this case

51     Bearing in mind the objectives of the CRS, I am of the view that the imposition of any enhanced sentence must:

> ·    serve the purposes for which a person was placed on remission, and

> ·    preserve the integrity of the operation of the CRS.

If the person does not seize the opportunity to reintegrate into society and instead breach the basic condition of the remission order by re-offending during the remission period, it is an abuse of the privilege of completing the remainder of the custodial punishment outside the prison walls. Such a breach of the basic condition would certainly warrant the imposition of an enhanced sentence. An enhanced sentence is not a fresh punishment but a “clawback” of the privilege to have the remaining one-third of the sentence completed outside prison.

52     Committing an offence while outside prison during the remission period would undermine the CRS. A person granted the remission order is supposed to abide by the basic condition and complete serving his unexpired sentence within the community. Instead, he had used his freedom to cause harm to society. For such a person, who should have been serving his sentence in prison (and thus incapacitated from carrying out activities detrimental to society), causing harm with his conditional liberty would hugely undermine the CRS. The CRS could then be seen as failing in its objectives.

53     That was why the then Senior Minister of Home Affairs Mr Masagos had to issue a warning that “…, at the end of the day, even with the additional support and aftercare provided to the ex-offender, it is ultimately the responsibility of the individual not to re-offend. If he does, he will be dealt with swiftly and strictly by the law.”[^7]

54     Nonetheless, if it can be shown that the breach of the basic condition would not undermine the CRS or did not reflect a lack of commitment on the part of the person to stay crime-free and reintegrate into the community, there would be no reason to revoke that privilege by imposing an enhanced sentence.

55     The assessment of whether the breach of the basic condition warrants an enhanced sentence is made by reference to the factors in s50T(3). This is the first stage. If an enhanced sentence is warranted, the determination of the length of the enhanced sentence is also made by reference to the same factors in s50T(3). This would be the second stage.

56     How are the factors in s50T(3)(a)-(d) to be utilized in deciding whether to impose an enhanced sentence? At this first stage, the factors listed in (3)(a) of “gravity” and (3)(b) of “similarity” are fairly self-evident in most cases. To commit a grave offence certainly warrants the cessation of the remaining remission period. To commit another offence of the same nature likewise warrants the person to serve the remaining portion of the remission period back in prison since it reveals in the most blatant way the lack of rehabilitative potential and leaves little room for reformation. Obviously, if the similarity is of a lesser degree than sameness, then an enhanced sentence would still be warranted but the difference would have to be reflected in the length of the enhanced sentence to be imposed.

57     The factor of “time” listed in (c) is less straightforward to apply at this first stage. In principle, the sooner the breach of the basic condition, by committing another offence, occurs after release, the stronger the need to impose an enhanced sentence. However, the commission of a minor offence which is dissimilar to the Remission Offences, committed very soon after release, would not readily warrant an enhanced sentence by virtue of the shortness of time from release. This is why I did not agree with the Prosecution’s initial framework in which the three factors of “gravity”, “similarity” and “time” were given equal weight.

58     The factor in s50T(3)(d) covers “all other relevant circumstances” and by definition will depend on the specific circumstances, whether mitigating or aggravating. Nothing more need be said at this juncture.

59     Once, it is clear that an enhanced sentence is warranted, we move to the second stage of deciding the length of the enhanced sentence using the same factors. This stage is a lot trickier, as is to be expected, when any sentence has to be calibrated on a sound basis with clear reasoning. It is often _easier to identify and recognise_ the relevant factors and _very difficult to assign value_ to each factor. It is made more difficult when a factor has to be considered in juxtaposition with other factors.

60     I am of the view that the **starting point** in determining the length of the enhanced sentence should begin with the full period remaining of the remission order as at the date of the commission of the offence leading to the breach of the basic condition. We start with the full remaining remission period on the basis that in principle there has been a _fundamental violation of the conditional release_. It is a **basic** condition and that is the least to be expected of the person that he should not re-offend during the remission period. If he did, the full remaining period of conditional remission should be revoked, as a starting position. This is what I would call the “institutional perspective”.

61     From the “personal perspective”, by which I am referring to the perspective of the person granted conditional release, he ought to have the mind-set and perspective that he has been given the opportunity to serve out the remainder of his sentence outside prison. It is a precious opportunity for which he must do his utmost to keep himself out of trouble with the law. If he fails to do so, his freedom will be curtailed and he can expect to serve out the remainder of the suspended sentence behind prison walls. Therefore, from both the perspectives of the individual and the institution, the **starting position** for the enhanced sentence should be to impose the full period remaining on the remission order.

62     The duration of the remaining period, as at the date of the commission of the offence, is the limit of the length of the enhanced sentence that can be imposed. To start with the maximum number of days left of the remaining period, provides the court with a reliable anchor from which concrete values could be assigned to the factors listed in s50T(3). Let me illustrate with two examples. The first example is when there is very little left of the remission period. The second example is when there is a long time left of the remission period at the time of the re-offending.

63     If a person _only had a few days left_ of the remission period when he re-offended, even if the gravity of the Breaching Offence is low and it is similar but not identical to the Remission Offence, if an enhanced sentence is warranted, it will be reasonable to impose the full remaining period as the enhanced sentence. It would be meaningless otherwise.

64     On the other hand, if the person had re-offended soon after release on remission and has many months left, or even years (as is common for the remission periods of Drug Trafficking and LT drug consumption offences), having the full remaining period of remission as a starting point, would help to focus the mind of the sentencing judge on a tangible period of time by which the judge can see the effect and impact of each factor on the enhanced sentence to be calibrated in concrete terms. In this way, there would be a meaningful assignment of value to the factors of gravity, similarity and any other relevant circumstances.

65     Although the suggested starting point is the full remaining remission period of the Remission Offence, this starting point is immediately qualified by the situation where there is more than one type of Remission Offences to be considered. The case at hand is a prime example of such a situation. Dom committed the offence of **Affray** while on conditional remission for the offences of **LT1** and **VCH** (and Failure to report for urine test but this was ordered to run concurrently and therefore rendered nugatory for our consideration). As the Prosecution had acknowledged through the revisions of their initial proposed framework, it would only be right not to take into account the portion of the remission period for the **LT1** sentence. The **Affray** offence is not a grave offence and is entirely dissimilar to the **LT1** Remission Offence. Therefore, the starting point should exclude the portion of the remission period for the **LT1** sentence.

66     The next step in the second stage requires the assigning of value to the factors of _gravity_ and _similarity_. It is easier to approach this step by assigning value to the factor of _similarity_ first. When the Breaching Offence and the Remission Offence are similar, we are immediately afforded a direct basis of comparison.

67     So, for the present case, where the Breaching Offence is **Affray** as compared to the Remission Offence of **VCH**, the Breaching Offence is less serious by virtue of its nature as well as the statutory punishment prescribed for **Affray** being up to one year’s imprisonment. **VCH** is punishable by up to 2 years’ imprisonment.[^8] The **Affray** offence is an offence of violence and is similar to the **VCH** Remission Offence although comparatively minor. Therefore, the enhanced sentence would have to be calibrated down from the full remaining remission period for **VCH**. The exact number of days and the reasons for the figure are addressed at the latter part of this Grounds of Decision.

68     The assigning of value for the factor of gravity where the Remission Offence and the Breaching Offence are dissimilar is the least precise by virtue of the very fact that it is very difficult, in common parlance, “to compare apples and oranges”. Of course, if the Breaching Offence is very grave, regardless of its dissimilarity with the Remission Offences, the temptation is to impose the full remaining remission period. However, to do so purely on the grounds of the Breaching Offence being a very serious offence would invariably attract the criticism of double-counting. The seriousness or gravity of the Breaching Offence is already reflected in the heavier punishment for that offence.

69     There has to be a separate and sound basis to determine the value of the _gravity_ factor. In my view, that separate basis should be one of how such a grave offence revealed the attitude of the offender towards CRS and to what extent the CRS had been undermined by the grave offence. The poorer the attitude of the offender, the longer the enhanced sentence should be. If the CRS has been significantly undermined, the enhanced sentence has to be higher to achieve a stronger deterrent effect to preserve the CRS.

70     The _final step_ in the calibration of the length of the enhanced sentence would be the consideration of the factor in s50T(3)(d) which is to look at all other relevant circumstances. One such possible circumstance is the oft-cited sentencing factor of pleading guilty to the offence. In my view, it would be erroneous to take into account such a factor since pleading guilty to the Breaching Offence is totally irrelevant. The breach of the basic condition of a remission order is an automatic and direct consequence of the conviction of the offence committed during the period of the remission order.

71     In summary, the court’s approach is as follows:

> Stage 1

> ·    If the Breaching Offence is _not grave_ **and** _not similar_ to the Remission Offence or any of the Remission Offences if there are more than one, there is little reason to impose an enhanced sentence, unless the circumstances of the re-offending reveal a blatant disregard for the law or a total lack of interest to remain offence-free.

> ·    If the Breaching Offence is _grave_ **or** _similar_ to the Remission Offence or any of the Remission Offences if there are more than one, an enhanced sentence would be warranted. With that, we move on to Stage 2.

> Stage 2

> ·    Where there are two or more Remission Offences for which the person was placed on remission, the first step is to decide which of the Remission Offences should not be included in the calibration of the enhanced sentence for the Breaching Offence.

> ·    The second step is to utilize the maximum remaining remission period of the relevant Remission Offence as the starting point and calibrate the length of the enhanced sentence based on the gravity and similarity factors stipulated in s50T(3).

> ·    If the Breaching Offence (e.g. VCH) and the Remission Offence are identical (e.g VCH) or more serious (e.g. Voluntarily Causing Grievous Hurt), the full remaining remission period should be imposed.

> ·    If the Breaching Offence is of the same type but less serious than the Remission Offence, assess the relative severity of the two offences and determine the length of the enhanced sentence. This is a value judgment by the sentencing judge.

> ·    If the Breaching Offence is a grave offence but is of a different type from the Remission Offence, a significant length of the remaining remission period ought to be imposed. Again, the actual length would depend on the value judgment being exercised by the sentencing judge. The graver the Breaching Offence is (_e.g_. robbery or rape), even if it is of an entirely different nature from the Remission Offence (_e.g_. drug trafficking), it is more than reasonable to expect the full remaining remission period to be imposed on the basis of it being a blatant abuse of the opportunity to complete the suspended sentence outside prison and within the community.

> ·    Throughout the steps at Stage 2 of the enhanced sentencing exercise, one thing must be borne in mind and that is to avoid double-counting in the factors for the calibration of the sentence of the Breaching Offence _per se_ and the factors for the calibration of the enhanced sentence for the _breach of the basic condition_ of the Remission Order.

> ·    Finally, the last step of Stage 2 is to take into account all other relevant circumstances under s50T(3)(d). At this step, the court may consider if there are other factors such as possibly relating to the health, physical or mental, of the offender. The health of the offender could be relevant in appraising the nature of the re-offending or it could be relevant to the effects of a longer incarceration. There could also be situations where there were extenuating circumstances for the re-offending that revealed it was an unpremeditated one-off incident and not a failure of the person to be reformed or lead to the CRS being undermined. In such situations, it is arguable that to impose an enhanced sentence might compromise the efforts made by the person to reintegrate into society.

## Calibration of the Enhanced Sentence of 30 days

72     Utilizing the approach described above, I proceeded to consider and calibrate the enhanced sentence in this case after deciding on a sentence of imprisonment for the **Affray** conviction.

73     To recap, for the reasons I had given at Paragraph 6 of the Oral Grounds, I sentenced Dom to imprisonment of 1 week for the offence of **Affray**. Consequently, as Dom was under a remission order[^9] at the time of the commission of the offence, he had breached the basic condition of his remission order. He was therefore liable for an additional enhanced sentence. As at the date of committing the Affray offence, he had 718 days remaining of his remission period of which 713 days (or close to 2 years) were available to be imposed as an enhanced sentence.

74     The first stage is to determine if an enhanced sentence is warranted for Dom in this case. According to s50T(3)(a), we look at the gravity of the Breaching Offence. Here, it is obvious that Affray is not a grave offence. This factor alone would suggest that an enhanced sentence is not called for.

75     Next, for the factor in s50(3)(b), we look at the similarity of the Breaching Offence and the Remission Offences. As alluded to earlier, if there was only one Remission Offence for comparison, it is simple and straightforward. In this case, Dom was placed on conditional remission for 3 offences – **LT1** drug consumption offence, **VCH** offence and Failure to Report for Urine Test.

76     If Dom had only been on conditional remission for the drug offences, taking into account that the Breaching Offence of Affray was not grave and not drug-related in any way, I would have no difficulty deciding that there was no need for an enhanced sentence to be imposed. This would be so, even though he had committed the offence of **Affray** within a very short time of 33 days after his release from prison and put on CRS.

77     However, one of the Remission Offences was the offence of **VCH**, which is an offence of violence. **Affray** is also an offence of violence, albeit the gravamen of this offence is a disturbance of the public peace. Bearing the similarity in mind and the re-offending so soon after release from prison, I was of the view that an enhanced sentence was warranted. There were no other relevant circumstances, to be considered under s50(3)(d), that would change that view. With that, we move on to the second stage to determine the length of the enhanced sentence.

78     At this second stage to determine the length of the enhanced sentence, where there are two or more Remission Offences to take into account, the first step is to decide if any of the remission periods attributable to the different Remission Offences should be excluded from consideration. It is not controversial that it is only fair to exclude the remaining remission periods of the Remission Offences that are dissimilar and unconnected in any way to the Breaching Offence. Both the Prosecution and the Defence share this view. Therefore, the remission periods for the offences of **LT1** and Failure to Report for Urine Test would not be included in the calibration of the length of the enhanced sentence.

79     As an aside, it is pertinent to note that the idea of apportionment of the remission periods where there are more than one Remission Offence can be found within the Prisons Act. Section 50K(3) that deals with apportionment and the working out of the period of the remainder of the prisoner’s sentence where 2 or more consecutive sentences are imposed, it is stipulated as follows:

> “(3)  If the remission order is made under section 50I and 2 or more consecutive sentences are imposed on the prisoner in respect of whom the remission order is made, the remainder of the prisoner’s sentence shall be the period worked out according to the following steps:

>> (a)    first, apportion the total time (in days) the prisoner has spent serving his aggregate sentence among each of the consecutive sentences (including default sentences) as if each sentence is served in the same proportion;

>> (b)    second, work out the portion (in days) of each of the consecutive sentences (including default sentences) which is not served after taking into account the portion which is deemed under paragraph (a) as having been served;

>> (c)    third, add the portion of each of the consecutive sentences (excluding default sentences) worked out under paragraph (b) which is not served.

80     In the present case, the proportion of the remaining period of remission attributable to the **LT1** offence is 636 days. (There is no attribution to be given to the sentence for the Failure to Report for Urine Test offence as it was ordered to run concurrently.) When we subtract this 636 days from the 713 days of total remission period remaining for all the Remission Offences, we would have **77 days**. This is the number of days remaining of the remission period attributable to the Remission Offence of **VCH**.

81     After establishing the maximum remaining remission period of the relevant Remission Offence, the next step in Stage 2 is to use this **77 days** as the starting point and calibrate the length of the enhanced sentence based on the factors in s50T(3)(a)-(d).

82     Here, the Breaching Offence is **Affray** and the relevant Remission Offence is **VCH**. **Affray** is generally considered less serious than **VCH** and therefore the gravity of the offence is lower. This is also reflected in the punishments prescribed for **Affray** and **VCH**. **Affray** is punishable with imprisonment of up to 1 year while it is up to 2 years for **VCH** at the material time. (**VCH** is now punishable with up to 3 years’ imprisonment with effect from 1 January 2020.) Bearing the lower gravity of the offence in mind, it would be reasonable to reduce the calibration of the enhanced sentence from the starting point of 77 days by at least half, which puts us in the range of 35 to 40 days.

83     After taking into account the factors of _gravity_ and _similarity_, the next factor is the time period from release before re-offending. As mentioned before, the time factor is already an in-built or inherent aspect of the CRS. The sooner the re-offending, the higher the number of days available for the enhanced sentence. This point is thrown into sharp relief when the maximum remaining remission period is the starting position.

84     Finally, we consider the factor in s50T(3)(d) of all other relevant circumstances. In this case, a very relevant circumstance is the reason for the **Affray**. The incident arose from a misunderstanding. Dom had helped Zaino to secure a job and he had to be present at the place of work on Zaino’s first day but Dom had overslept. Zaino was disappointed that Dom had not kept his promise and did not accept his explanation when he confronted him at the Selarang Halfway House front gate. Both got into an argument and it escalated into a fight. This formed the facts of the **Affray** offence.

85     It is clear that the **Affray** happened without premeditation and did not reveal any blatant disregard for the law or a poor attitude towards the CRS. More significantly and quite ironically, the incident arose out of a situation in which both offenders were trying to mend their ways. Zaino was keen on getting the job that Dom had recommended. I would consider this rather unique background to the incident of **Affray** to be a highly mitigating and relevant circumstance under s50T(3)(d) and impose an enhanced sentence lower than the range of 35 to 40 days that was based on _gravity_ and _similarity_.

86     If the background to the **Affray** incident is seen as unique and mitigating, why should the court still impose an enhanced sentence, since it is discretionary and not mandatory? The reason for still imposing the enhanced sentence in this case is to preserve the integrity of the CRS and to send out a deterrent message to all persons placed on conditional remission that a basic breach of the condition of the remission order undermines the rehabilitative efforts of all concerned.

87     All considered, an enhanced sentence of **30 days** was imposed.

## Conclusion

88     Although it seems like a tedious exercise whenever enhanced sentencing under s50T(1)(a) is called for, in cases where it involves only one Breaching Offence and one Remission Offence, the exercise is simple and can be quickly and easily completed.

89     The suggested Approach, based on the objectives of the CRS under the Prisons Act, should prove itself useful when there are multiple Remission Offences (with consecutive sentences) involved in the enhanced sentencing exercise. It is hoped that the suggested Approach – adopted for the calibration of the enhanced sentence in this case – can be helpful for other cases to achieve the desired equilibrium between facilitating the rehabilitation of prisoners and their reintegration into society and safeguarding the integrity of the CRS.

90     At the end of the day, when all is said and done, it is in the interests of the person who has been ordered to be on Conditional Remission by the Commissioner of Prisons not to commit **any** offence during the remission period. It is apt to reiterate that it is a **basic** condition. Such a person ought to have the mind-set and perspective that he has been given the opportunity to serve out the remainder of his sentence outside prison. If he fails to do so, his freedom will be curtailed as he can expect to serve out the remainder of the suspended sentence behind prison walls.

91     It remains for me to record my appreciation to the DPP and the DC for their assistance in the course of the proceedings for this case. The Prosecution had filed this appeal against sentence and applied for a stay of execution on the sentence. The application was granted and Dom has not begun serving his sentence. In the meantime, Dom is still subject to the Remission Order dated 3 December 2018 that will remain effective until the end of the remission period on 22 December 2020. A copy of the Remission Order issued by the Commissioner of Prisons to Dom under s50I is attached as Annex A and a copy of the revised Summary Sheet is attached as Annex B.

[^1]: Unless otherwise specified, the provisions cited throughout the rest of this Grounds of Decision refer to provisions in the Prisons Act (Chapter 247, 2000 Rev Ed).

[^2]: Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (20 January 2014) vol 91.

[^3]: The Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence dated 4 October 2019 at \[10\].

[^4]: In the case of _PP v Chandrasegaran s/o Raman_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 105</span>, there was a point raised about imposing the full remaining remission period to avoid “a perverse outcome” for a s50Y(1) offence. _In PP v Danny Eliezer Vaswani_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 181</span>, the same point was made about “the moral hazard” if the full remission period is not imposed as an enhanced sentence under s50T(1)(a). DPP had obtained clarification from Prisons that the Remission Order and the remission period remains valid and effective even after the enhanced sentence is imposed and served (see Footnote 4 of the Prosecution’s Further Submissions on Sentence of 11 November 2019). Therefore, the problem of “a perverse outcome” or “the moral hazard” would not arise.
