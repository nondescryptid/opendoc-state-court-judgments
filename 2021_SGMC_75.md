### District Judge Sheik Umar Bin Mohamed Bagushair:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff brought this claim against the Defendant for the injury and losses she suffered when she fell whilst on an escalator at the Adelphi Shopping Centre (“Premises”) on 29 June 2017 (the “Accident”). The Premises were managed by the Defendant. At the time of the Accident, the Plaintiff was 68 years old.

2       The trial before me was bifurcated and took place over two days. Two witnesses gave evidence on the Plaintiff’s behalf: The Plaintiff and her husband Mr Rolland Sandosham (“Mr Sandosham”). Mr Sandosham was on the escalator with the Plaintiff when the Accident happened. Three witnesses gave evidence on the Defendant’s behalf: Mr Wong Yeow Keong (“Mr Wong”), the operations manager from Hitachi Elevator Asia Pte Ltd (“Hitachi”), Ms Chang Mei Foong (“Ms Chang”), the building manager for Propmag Management Service Pte Ltd (“Propmag”) and Mr Wong Wei Kiat (Huang Weijie) (“Mr Huang”), an eyewitness to the Accident. Hitachi had supplied and maintained the escalator the Plaintiff was on when the Accident happened and Propmag are the Premises’ managing agents.

3       On 16 July 2021, I entered interlocutory judgment in the Plaintiff’s favour at 100%. I gave brief reasons for my decision. I now set out my detailed grounds.

## Parties’ pleaded positions

4       A number of pleading points were raised and so it makes sense for me to first set out the parties’ pleadings and address those arguments. For example, the Defendant argued that since it was the Plaintiff’s case that “the escalator suddenly and without warning, violently jerked forwards and backwards” and that resulted in the Plaintiff falling, it was not open to the Plaintiff to make a more general assertion that the escalator had malfunctioned and that resulted in the Plaintiff falling.

5       In Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2), the Plaintiff asserted that the Accident occurred as follows:

> On the aforesaid date, whilst the Plaintiff and her husband were travelling on an escalator (“the escalator”) from the basement to Level 1 in the premises, the escalator suddenly and without warning, violently jerked forwards and backwards, causing the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s husband to fall onto the steps of the escalator. As a result, the Plaintiff sustained severe injuries. The Plaintiff avers that at all material times, both she and her husband were holding onto the handrails of the escalator.

6       The Defendant’s pleaded response in its Defence (Amendment No 2) was essentially a bare denial:

> 4.    Paragraph 3…is denied in its entirety and the Plaintiff is put to strict proof. The Defendants deny that the escalator violently jerked forwards and backwards, causing the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s husband to fall onto the steps of the escalator, as alleged. The Defendants aver that the Plaintiff’s version of the alleged accident in her Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) is materially and fundamentally different from and/or inconsistent with her initial/ contemporaneous version, namely that it was her husband who had fallen on her first and had caused her to lose balance and fall next, and therefore, that it is a latter addition/ concoction and an afterthought devoid of any factual substratum. It is also denied that the escalator was in a defective and/ or dangerous condition. Causation is disputed and the Plaintiff is put to strict proof on all her allegations.

> ..

> 6.    The Defendants briefly aver that the accident was due to the Plaintiff and/ or her husband’s negligence. Further and/or in the alternative, the Defendants aver based on the Plaintiff’s initial/ contemporaneous version that the Plaintiff’s husband fell backwards onto the Plaintiff and had caused the Plaintiff to fall backwards and/ or onto the steps of the escalator and that this constituted a _novus actus interveniens_ and the Defendants cannot be liable to the Plaintiff.

7       I make the following observations about the pleadings set out above. First, it appeared that the Defendant was not mounting a positive case and had put the Plaintiff to strict proof as to how the Accident happened. This is of course something it is entitled to do. However, there are evidential implications to such an approach. The law draws a sharp distinction between bare denials and positive allegations. This distinction bears significant evidential implications. If a defendant denies part of a claim, he is “not entitled to call evidence of fact contrary to the plaintiff’s contention without first setting out his positive case in his defence” (_Singapore Civil Procedure 2020_, vol 1 (Hon Justice Chua Lee Ming ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th ed, 2020) (“_Singapore Civil Procedure_”) at para 18/13/4)). However, the Defendant called Mr Huang to give evidence as to what transpired. Although at various points during the trial, the Defendant Counsel emphasised that the Defendant was _not_ taking a position on how the Accident occurred, ultimately, the Defendant adopted Mr Huang’s evidence. This can be seen from paragraph 137 of its closing submissions where the Defendant set out “what happened” based on Mr Huang’s evidence, the essence of which was as follows (“Mr Huang’s Version”):

> i.    The Plaintiff and her husband…were on the escalator going up from the basement to level 1. The escalator was in motion and had not stopped…

> ii.    When \[Mr Sandosham\] reached level 1, he lost his balance and fell forward…

> iii.  The Plaintiff, who was close behind \[Mr Sandosham\], tripped over \[him\] and fell forward…

8       Strictly speaking, the Defendant was _not_ entitled to adduce or rely upon Mr Huang’s evidence about how the Accident occurred given it had not put forth a positive case as to what occurred. Notwithstanding this, I did not think Mr Huang’s evidence should be excluded. This was because the Plaintiff did not object to Mr Huang’s evidence. The Plaintiff did not file a notice to object to Mr Huang’s evidence. Neither did she object to Mr Huang giving evidence at the trial. Finally, the Plaintiff did not argue in her closing submissions that Mr Huang’s evidence should be excluded because the Defendant failed to set forth a positive case about how the Accident occurred. The situation is therefore not dissimilar from _Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat and others_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 3 SLR(R) 265</span> (“_Nagase_”). In that case, the court found that although the defendants had pleaded bare denials and were therefore prevented from raising certain defences, as the plaintiff failed to object at an earlier stage (raising an objection only in its closing submissions), the court declined to exclude the defences or the evidence in support of the defences (_Nagase_ at \[165\]–\[177\]).

9       My second observation about the pleadings is the Defendant’s reliance on “the Plaintiff’s initial/ contemporaneous version that the Plaintiff’s husband fell backwards onto the Plaintiff and had caused the Plaintiff to fall backwards and/ or onto the steps of the escalator” (which for convenience I will refer to as the “Initial Version”). The Defendant says that based on the Initial Version, the Plaintiff’s present account is an “addition/ concoction and an afterthought devoid of any factual substratum” and further that it gives rise to an act of _novus actus interveniens_. Although the Plaintiff’s present account of the Accident is now different from the Initial Version, the Defendant’s position (although not stated so explicitly) is that the Plaintiff must be _bound_ to the Initial Version. Putting aside for the moment whether the Defendant’s position can be supported by authority, I had a more fundamental difficulty with this because the Initial Version is not even the version of events that the Defendant has adopted (_ie_, Mr Huang’s Version). Mr Huang’s version is that Mr Sandosham had fallen _forward_, and that the Plaintiff tripped over him and had also fallen _forward_. But in the Initial Version, Mr Sandosham had fallen _backwards_ onto the Plaintiff and this caused the Plaintiff to also fall backwards. I did not think it was open to the Defendant to say, on the one hand, that what happened was Mr Huang’s Version, and on the other hand, insist that the Plaintiff must be bound to the Initial Version that on the Defendant’s own case is wrong. If the Initial Version was wrong, then surely the Plaintiff cannot be criticised for moving away from it, which she has done.

10     Therefore, my view is that the only two competing versions of the Accident is the Plaintiff’s present account (as set out in her Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2)) and Mr Huang’s version. Neither party is relying on the Initial Version as being correct and for all intents and purposes, it should be ignored and not relied upon. It follows from this that at least two of the Defendant’s arguments falls away. First, in so far as the Defendant says that the Plaintiff’s present account is an “addition/ concoction and an afterthought devoid of any factual substratum” because of the Initial Version, that argument cannot be accepted, since the Defendant’s position is that the Initial Version is not what actually happened. Second, in so far as the Defendant relies on the Initial Version to argue _novus actus interveniens_, that argument falls away, again because the Defendant accepts that the Initial Version is not what actually happened.

## The facts

11     At around 11 am on 29 June 2017, the Plaintiff was with her husband Mr Sandosham and had just finished having a meal at a café at the basement of the Premises. The Plaintiff and Mr Sandosham then made their way to level 1 by taking the escalator.

12     The Plaintiff says that they were both holding on to the handrail while on the escalator. Mr Sandosham was standing one step in front of the Plaintiff, to her right. Mr Sandosham was therefore holding on to the right handrail and the Plaintiff was holding on to the left handrail. As the escalator passed the middle section and was about to reach level 1, “the escalator suddenly and without warning, violently jerked forwards and backwards, causing the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s husband to fall onto the steps of the escalator.”

13     The Defendant disputed the Plaintiff’s version of events and argued that:

> (a)     The Plaintiff did not hold on to the handrail.

> (b)     The escalator did not “violently \[jerk\] forwards and backwards”.

> (c)     The Plaintiff did not fall onto the steps of the escalator.

14     The Defendant relied on the testimony of an eyewitness Mr Huang, as well as a number of other documents that had been produced in evidence.

### Whether the Plaintiff held onto the handrail

15     Firstly, the Defendant disputed that the Plaintiff was holding onto the handrail. I can dispose of this argument quickly because there is no evidence to support the Defendant’s position. Mr Huang’s evidence was that he “cannot recall” whether the Plaintiff was holding onto the handrail. This was not a denial. Indeed, it meant that it was entirely possible that the Plaintiff _was_ holding onto the handrails, but Mr Huang simply could not remember whether that happened.

16     The Plaintiff and her husband confirmed that they were holding onto the handrails at the time. I accepted their evidence, not only because there was no contradictory evidence, but also because I thought it more likely, given that the Plaintiff was almost 70 years old, that she would indeed be holding onto the handrail while riding the escalator.

### Whether the escalator had violently jerked forwards and backwards

17     Secondly, the Defendant denied that the escalator had “violently jerked forwards and backwards”. The Defendant made two distinct arguments.

#### The Defendant’s argument that Mr Huang’s evidence was to be preferred over the Plaintiff’s evidence

18     The first argument was that Mr Huang did not witness the escalator “violently jerk\[ing\] forwards and backwards” and Mr Huang’s evidence should be preferred. His evidence on this point was as follows:

> …I did not see the escalator jerking forward and backward or stopping suddenly or stop moving at all or at any time. There was no violent jerking forward and backward of the escalator.

19     In my view, Mr Huang’s evidence does not necessarily contradict the Plaintiff’s evidence. It must be remembered that the jerking of the escalator happened suddenly and within a short time. From the time Mr Huang first saw the Plaintiff till she lost her balance and fell, only “a matter of seconds” had passed. In fact, I cannot imagine that the whole jerking took more than a split second. Furthermore, Mr Huang explained that he had focused on the Plaintiff and Mr Sandosham when “they tripped over.” That is to say, before that, Mr Huang was not focused on observing the Plaintiff and Mr Sandosham. Consequently, it seems to me more than possible that Mr Huang did not see the jerking of the escalator, even if it happened.

20     Even if I was wrong on this, I would prefer the Plaintiff’s evidence over Mr Huang’s evidence. First, the Plaintiff’s evidence is corroborated by Mr Sandosham who was on the escalator. The Defendant argued that Mr Sandosham’s evidence had no value because he was not an independent witness, presumably because he was the Plaintiff’s husband. I could not accept this, for the following reasons:

> (a)     Mr Sandosham was on the escalator together with the Plaintiff when the Accident occurred, and his evidence was highly relevant. I do not think it is fair to assume, without more, that Mr Sandosham’s relationship with the Plaintiff meant he was not an independent witness.

> (b)     The Defendant Counsel did not put to Mr Sandosham that he was not an independent witness. Given the materiality of such an assertion (which if accepted would have the effect of excluding all of Mr Sandosham’s evidence), I did not think it was fair to argue that Mr Sandosham was not an independent witness without first giving him an adequate opportunity to respond to such an assertion.

> (c)     Finally, it seemed to me that the Defendant’s approach to Mr Sandosham’s evidence was selective. The Defendant readily accepted Mr Sandosham’s evidence, given on the stand, that his injuries were limited to bruises on his palms, as it supported the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff and Mr Sandosham fell forwards. However, the Defendant was not prepared to accept any other evidence from Mr Sandosham, in particular evidence that supported the Plaintiff’s case. If indeed the Defendant was correct to say that Mr Sandosham was not an independent witness, then _none_ of his evidence should be accepted. That the Defendant urged me to selectively accept only Mr Sandosham’s evidence that supported its case, and ignore the rest of his evidence, in particular evidence supporting the Plaintiff’s case, suggested to me that the Defendant’s argument about Mr Sandosham’s alleged lack of independence was not a serious or a principled one.

21     A second reason why I preferred the Plaintiff’s evidence over Mr Huang’s evidence is that the circumstances surrounding the Accident are likely to be strongly etched in the Plaintiff’s mind, rather than Mr Huang’s mind. The Accident had shocked the Plaintiff. In contrast, Mr Huang was an eyewitness who could not be said to have been shocked by the Accident. In fact, Mr Huang said that after witnessing the Accident, he brought the Plaintiff and Mr Sandosham to the security counter and did not stay around and left soon after, because it was not a “huge matter”. All things being equal, it seemed to me that a person who experienced an event and was shocked by it would more accurately recall the details of the event than a bystander who merely witnessed the event.

22     A third reason for preferring the Plaintiff’s evidence was that whilst the Plaintiff may have been confused or unsure about some aspects of her evidence, her evidence about what happened on the escalator was clear. I did not think the other aspects of her evidence which she was unclear or unsure about affected the credibility of her account of the Accident. It is also unrealistic to expect the evidence of any witness, much less one who was almost 70 years old, to be perfect in every respect. When the Plaintiff was giving evidence on the stand, she struck me as someone who was trying her best to answer the questions posed to her even though she was unsure or unclear about certain aspects of her evidence. She did not strike me as someone prone to exaggeration or hyperbole. Certainly, my impression of her was not of someone “unwieldly, difficult, uncooperative and unreliable…\[and\] who was unable to give credible, consistent and cogent evidence…” as argued by the Defendant. I therefore thought that the Plaintiff’s account of the Accident was credible. This is not to suggest in any way that Mr Huang lied. I am sure Mr Huang’s evidence was given in good faith, based on his best recollection of events that happened several years ago. However, for the reasons set out above, I preferred the Plaintiff’s evidence over Mr Huang’s evidence.

#### The Defendant’s argument that the Plaintiff’s evidence was inconsistent with her past pleadings and medical reports

23     Next, the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff’s present account of the Accident was inconsistent with her past pleadings as well as her medical reports. In her earlier pleadings and medical reports, the Plaintiff’s position was that the escalator had jerked forward _and stopped moving_. For example, in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (filed on 8 August 2019) she pleaded that “the escalator suddenly and without warning, violently jerked forward _and stopped moving_ \[emphasis in italics added\].” Similarly, in the medical report of Dr Siow Weiming dated 9 April 2018 (“Dr Siow’s Report”), Dr Siow had recorded the Plaintiff informing him that “the escalator suddenly jerked forwards _and stopped suddenly_ \[emphasis in italics added\].” The Plaintiff’s present pleaded position does not say that escalator had stopped moving and the Defendant therefore argued that there was an inconsistency.

24     I could not accept the Defendant’s argument. In respect of the Plaintiff’s past pleadings, I could not see how they had any legal or evidential effect. Neither party is now asserting that the escalator had stopped suddenly. The Defendant’s own position, based on Mr Huang’s evidence, is that the escalator did _not_ stop suddenly, and that it stopped only after he pressed the emergency stop button. I found it puzzling that the Defendant nevertheless insisted that this assertion (which had been expressly abandoned by the Plaintiff and was not accepted by the Defendant) was relevant in deciding whether the Plaintiff’s account of the Accident was to be believed.

25     The Plaintiff’s past pleadings also have no evidential value whatsoever. The fact that the Plaintiff had taken a certain position in her past pleadings did not mean _ipso facto_ that there is evidence of the same. Pleadings are _not_ evidence. But no one has produced evidence, in the form of witness testimony, that the escalator had stopped suddenly. The Plaintiff’s pleaded position and her AEIC evidence is that the escalator jerked forwards and backwards. Mr Sandosham’s evidence was similar. Mr Huang’s evidence is that the escalator did not jerk forwards and backwards and did not stop suddenly. As there is no evidential basis for the assertion that the escalator had stopped suddenly, I do not see how the assertion is relevant at all. Certainly, it would be wrong to argue that this assertion is equally probative as the Plaintiff’s assertion that the escalator had jerked forwards and backwards, as if these two assertions were supported by evidence and were being equally pursued by the Plaintiff. They were not.

26     I also think that, as a point of principle, it is wrong to rely on a party’s past pleadings as evidence to contradict that party’s present pleaded position. A party is entitled to amend its pleadings. There are certain limitations of course – for example, the amendments would not be allowed if they can be struck out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (“ROC”). But that is generally a high bar. Otherwise, a party can amend its pleadings to entirely abandon past pleadings or take positions in the amended pleadings which contradict the previous pleadings.

27     If the Defendant is correct to rely on the Plaintiff’s past pleadings as evidence to contradict the Plaintiff’s present pleaded position, then this would be a significant infringement on the Plaintiff’s right to amend her pleadings. In the future, all parties would only be able to amend their pleadings in a way that would not contradict earlier versions of their pleadings. I see no reason in principle or in authority which would support such a position. In fact, I consider that O 18 r 10 of the ROC implicitly gives a party significant freedom to amend its pleadings, so long as its pleadings are consistent with one other. So for example, if a plaintiff in his reply makes an allegation of fact that is inconsistent with his statement of claim, he will have to amend his statement of claim to remove that inconsistency. The Defendant has not pointed me to any authority that would allow me to rely on the Plaintiff’s previous pleadings as evidence to contradict the Plaintiff’s present pleaded position.

28     I turn to the medical reports. I do not agree that the Defendant can rely on the Plaintiff’s medical reports to contradict her version of events. The two doctors who prepared the reports, Dr Siow and Dr Peng, were not called as witnesses and their medical reports have not been admitted into evidence.

29     I readily acknowledge however that in two High Court decisions, the courts had partly relied upon the medical reports of doctors who had not yet been called to give evidence to assess the accuracy of the plaintiff’s account. The first case was _Cai Xiao Qing v Leow Fa Dong (by his next friend Leow Chye Huat)_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 67</span> (“_Cai Xiao Qing_”), which was an appeal from the District Court’s trial on liability. The District Court found that the defendant car driver was 90% liable, with the plaintiff cyclist 10% liable. On appeal, Lai Siu Chiu J allowed the appeal and reduced the defendant’s liability from 90% to 70%. One of the issues that had to be decided was whether the plaintiff cyclist was riding his bicycle or walking beside his bicycle at the time of the accident. If it was the former, the plaintiff’s liability would increase. Lai J said the following in relation to this issue (at \[23\]):

> It was clear to me that the respondent was cycling at the material time, and not walking beside his bicycle as he claimed. My reasons for this finding are threefold:

>> (a)    In a medical report of Dr Faizal bin Kassim attached to the statement of claim, it stated that “Mr Leow was allegedly involved in a road traffic accident earlier the same day where he was a cyclist that was _cycling_ past a zebra crossing...” (emphasis added); and

>> (b)    In a stern warning issued by the traffic police to the respondent, it was recorded that “the cyclist has been given a warning letter for _riding_ other than in an orderly manner and without due regard to the safety of others” (emphasis added).

>> (c)    The respondent applied to amend his pleadings in the midst of trial.. This seemed to be a concession on his part.

30     It can be seen that the medical report was one of three pieces of evidence that Lai J relied on before concluding that the plaintiff’s account was incorrect.

31     The second case is the unreported decision in _Xu Zhengbin v Sen Li Construction Pte Ltd & Anor_ (Suit 173 of 2016) (“_Xu Zhengbin_”), which was given after a trial on liability. In that decision, Audrey Lim JC (as she then was) had to decide whether the plaintiff had injured his wrist while carrying out certain works on 27 September 2014. Lim JC disbelieved the plaintiff’s account of events and his claim was dismissed. Amongst the evidence she considered was the medical report of a doctor who was not called to give evidence. The report appeared to contradict aspects of the plaintiff’s account. However, the court found that it would have come to the same conclusion even if the doctor’s report was disregarded. In essence, the reliance on the medical report was not central or key to the court’s conclusions.

32     Whilst I think that _Cai Xiao Qing_ and _Xu Zhengbin_ can be distinguished on the basis that the court did not _solely_ rely on the medical reports to conclude that the plaintiff’s account was not correct, I accept that the cases could stand for the proposition that medical reports of doctors can be relied upon as evidence even though the doctors were not called as witnesses and the medical reports had not been admitted into evidence.

33     Consequently, if I am wrong in holding that the Defendant cannot rely on the medical reports to contradict the Plaintiff’s version of events as the doctors were not called as witnesses and the medical reports have not been properly adduced into evidence, I consider that, in any event, the difference in the accounts to not be significant and can be explained.

34     I set out again the difference in the accounts. The Plaintiff says that the escalator “violently jerked forwards _and backwards_”, whilst in Dr Siow’s Report, the Plaintiff is recorded as stating that the escalator “jerked forwards _and stopped suddenly_” and in Dr Peng’s report, the Plaintiff is recorded as stating that the “escalator _stopped suddenly_”. The difference is therefore between the Plaintiff now saying that the escalator had jerked backwards when she had previously said that the escalator had stopped. I consider the difference between these two accounts to be minor. Furthermore, while on the escalator, it may be difficult for the Plaintiff to distinguish precisely between the escalator stopping suddenly or jerking backwards. This was because the escalator had first jerked forwards, and regardless of whether the escalator stopped or jerked backwards, the Plaintiff would have felt the same thing, and lost her balance. As I stated earlier, all of this happened within a split second and if the Plaintiff could not be entirely sure whether after the escalator jerked forwards it had stopped or had jerked backwards, I do not think the Plaintiff can be faulted.

### Whether the Plaintiff had fallen forwards or fallen onto the steps of the escalator

35     The Plaintiff said that she fell onto the steps of the escalator. Mr Huang’s evidence is that:

> Both \[Mr Sandosham\] and \[the Plaintiff\] fell forward when they reached the top of the escalator at the upper landing floor plate at Level 1. They did not fall onto the steps of the escalator. Nor had they fallen to the bottom of the steps of the escalator.

36     The Defendant argued that Mr Huang’s evidence should be accepted over the Plaintiff’s evidence.

37     For the reasons set out at \[20\] to \[22\], I preferred the Plaintiff’s evidence over Mr Huang’s evidence.

38     The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff’s account is different from the Initial Version, which was set out in her pleadings and her medical reports. For example, in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim dated 8 August 2019, the Plaintiff had asserted that “the escalator suddenly and without warning, violently jerked forward and stopped moving, _causing the Plaintiff’s husband to fall backwards on to the Plaintiff_ \[emphasis in italics added\].” Similarly, in Dr Siow’s Report, he had recorded the Plaintiff saying that the “escalator suddenly jerked forwards and stopped suddenly _and her husband was unable to maintain his balance and fell backwards onto her_ \[emphasis in italics added\].” The Defendant argued that this version of events, _ie_, the Initial Version, was inconsistent with the Plaintiff’s evidence.

39     I am unable to agree with the Defendant, for three reasons. First, I would repeat what I had said at \[9\] to \[10\] above. The Plaintiff had abandoned the Initial Version and the Defendant’s position is that the Initial Version did not happen. As I said above, it was not open to the Defendant to say, on the one hand, that what happened was Mr Huang’s Version, and on the other hand, insist that the Plaintiff must be bound to the Initial Version that on the Defendant’s own case is wrong. If the Initial Version was wrong, then surely the Plaintiff cannot be criticised for moving away from it, which she has done.

40     Second, I would repeat what I said above at \[24\] to \[32\]. I do not think the Plaintiff’s previous pleadings, or her medical reports, can be used as evidence to contradict the Plaintiff’s account of events.

41     Third, even if I accepted Mr Huang’s evidence, that the Plaintiff had fallen _backwards_, rather than fallen _onto the steps of the escalator_, the Plaintiff nevertheless fell. I have already found above that the escalator violently jerked forwards and backwards. On either party’s case she had fallen and injured herself.

## The Defendant’s duty of care towards the Plaintiff

42     The Defendant acknowledges that it owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff.

## Whether the Defendant breached its standard of care

43     The Plaintiff argued that the Defendant had breached its standard of care because of its failure to do the following:

> (a)     Causing or permitting the escalator to be or become or to remain in a defective or a dangerous condition, so that it was liable to and did in fact suddenly and violently jerk forwards and backwards causing the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s husband to fall onto the steps of the escalator.

> (b)     Failing to take any or any proper or effective measures, whether by periodic examination or inspection or to ensure that the escalator was not defective.

> (c)     Failing to institute or enforce any or any adequate system for the inspection and maintenance of the escalator whereby the defect might have been detected and repaired so that the Plaintiff’s accident might have been prevented.

> (d)     Failing to carry out any or any proper or timely repairs to the escalator.

> (e)     Failing to take any or any reasonable care to see that the Plaintiff was or would be safe in using the premises for the purpose for which she was permitted to be there.

> (f)     Failing to warn the Plaintiff that the escalator was faulty and/or in a dangerous condition.

> (g)     Operating and/or maintaining the escalator which was faulty and/or in a dangerous condition.

> (h)     Permitting the Plaintiff to use the escalator when they knew that it was faulty and/or in a dangerous condition.

> (i)     Causing or permitting the escalator to be or become or remain a danger and a trap.

> (j)     In the premises, failing to discharge their duty of care owed to the Plaintiff.

44     The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff had “led no evidence to prove the particulars of negligence or breach that she had pleaded.” The Defendant raised a number of points in support, but I did not find them to be persuasive or relevant. Curiously, the Defendant did not grapple with what I thought was the obvious issue, which was whether the Defendant had breached its standard of care by allowing the escalator to continue operating when it knew it had malfunctioned.

45     In determining the appropriate standard of care, the court would normally look at the following factors (_MCST Plan No 2668 v Root George Hugo_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 3 SLR 787</span> at \[27\]):

> (a)     The likelihood and risks of harm.

> (b)     The extent of harm.

> (c)     The costs of avoiding harm.

> (d)     The industry standards and common practice.

46     It is not disputed that:

> (a)     At around 9:45 am on the day of the Accident, the Premises’ security staff found that the left handrail of the escalator had stopped moving. They proceeded to call Hitachi to service the escalator. They also shut the escalator down. However, no barriers or notices were placed around the malfunctioning escalator.

> (b)     During the shift change of the Premises’ security staff at around 11 am, the new staff were not informed that the escalator had malfunctioned. The Premises’ security staff in the new shift therefore turned on the escalator.

47     I considered that the causative event that led to the Accident was the fact that the Plaintiff was allowed to use the escalator even after the Defendant became aware that it had malfunctioned. In my view, the Defendant had breached its standard of care by failing to do the following:

> (a)     Failing to barricade the escalator after shutting it down. This would not only prevent anyone from using the escalator, but it would also highlight to the security staff who was coming in after the shift change that the escalator had malfunctioned and was not to be switched on.

> (b)     Failing to put in place an adequate system so that the Premises’ security staff taking over from the staff of the previous shift were properly briefed about escalators that had malfunctioned and should remain switched off.

48     If either of the above actions had been taken, the Plaintiff would not have taken the escalator and the Accident would not have happened. The actions were easy to implement with little to no cost. The failure to implement them could have led to serious harm – for example a child on the escalator or someone not holding onto the handrail could have fallen down the escalator steps, leading to serious injury. While the likelihood and risks of harm arising from the failure to implement the actions may not have been high, I did not think they were low and therefore I considered the risks to be moderate. As for industry standards and common practice, no evidence was put forth as to what should be done if an escalator was faulty – for example, whether it should be barricaded immediately, or only later, when it was being examined and serviced.

49     The Defendant appeared to suggest that just because the left handrail was not moving, it did not follow that the escalator had malfunctioned. I am afraid I have to disagree with this attempt at hair-splitting. Whilst an escalator can malfunction in different ways, some of which are more serious than others, ultimately the Defendant cannot run away from the fact that it shut down the escalator after finding that the left handrail was not moving. If it thought that the escalator was perfectly safe, it would not have done this.

### Mr Wong’s opinion evidence

50     Relying on Mr Wong’s evidence, the Defendant argued that the malfunctioning escalator could not have caused the escalator to jerk back and forth as pleaded by the Plaintiff. Mr Wong’s evidence was as follows:

> On the morning of the material date, we were informed that the left hand rail was not moving. **In my professional experience, if the left rubber handrail does not move or operate as required, it will not result in the escalator jerking forward, jerking backward or stopping** \[emphasis in bold added\].

51     I am unable to accept Mr Wong’s evidence as set out above, and his opinion evidence generally, for the following reasons. Firstly, Mr Wong was proffered as a factual, rather than an expert witness. Consequently, his evidence did not satisfy even the most basic of requirements under O 40A of the ROC and Appendix A, Form 12 of the State Courts Practice Directions.

52     Second, I do not think there is sufficient evidence for me to conclude that Mr Wong is an “expert” under s 47(2) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) (“EA”). Mr Wong gave evidence that his highest qualification was a diploma in mechanical engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Although he had worked with Hitachi for 25 years, he was presently an operations manager, which suggests a managerial position. Although an expert can be skilled due to experience rather than special study (_Urs Eller v Cheong Kiat Wah_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 106</span> at \[36\]), there was no evidence before me as to what Mr Wong did in his 25 years in Hitachi. Consequently, there isn’t sufficient basis for me to conclude that Mr Wong had the necessary skill (even by way of experience) to be an “expert”.

53     Third, since Mr Wong was still an employee of Hitachi, who was responsible for servicing the escalator, he had an interest in the outcome of these proceedings. It was in Hitachi’s interest that the court find that the escalator’s malfunction could not possibly have caused the Accident as a contrary finding could expose it to potential liability. However, Mr Wong’s interest did not mean his evidence was automatically inadmissible. Where an expert witness has a connection with one of the parties or otherwise has an interest in the outcome of the proceedings, then although the interest does not automatically render his evidence inadmissible, the interest may nevertheless affect the weight of the evidence (_Kauffman, Gregory Lawrence and others v Datacraft Asia Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGHC 174</span> at \[31\]). Given Hitachi’s strong interest in not being exposed to potential liability, I could not give Mr Wong’s evidence much weight.

54     Fourth, Hitachi did not examine the escalator after the Accident to determine the cause of the malfunctioning handrail. Consequently, I thought it was somewhat presumptuous for Mr Wong to state unequivocally that the escalator malfunction could not have caused the escalator to jerk forwards and backwards.

55     Finally, I thought the undisputed evidence strongly pointed to the escalator malfunction causing the Accident. The escalator was over 25 years old at the time of the Accident. The malfunction to the left handrail was serious enough that the Defendant shut down the escalator. The Defendant would not have done this if it thought that the escalator was safe to operate despite the malfunction. After the Accident, Hitachi had replaced the left handrail chain and left hand tension chain. These were the parts that affected the operation of the left handrail. If these parts had not been malfunctioning or if it was not necessary to replace the parts, they would not have been replaced.

56     We therefore had an escalator that had operated for 25 years, that malfunctioned, and after the Accident required some parts to be replaced. Putting all these together, it seemed to me that there was more than sufficient evidence to conclude that the malfunctioning escalator had caused the escalator to jerk forwards and backwards when the Plaintiff was on it, resulting in the Accident. Hitachi or the Defendant could have provided rebuttal evidence to establish that the malfunctioning escalator did _not_ cause the Accident. It could have examined the escalator to determine the cause of the escalator malfunction. It could have prepared a report from an expert explaining why the escalator malfunction could not have resulted in the escalator jerking forwards and backwards and causing the Accident. None of this was done.

## Whether the Accident caused the Plaintiff’s injuries

57     The Defendant argued that the Accident did not cause the Plaintiff’s injuries. A number of arguments were raised. They centred on the contents of the Plaintiff’s medical reports and the Plaintiff’s failure to adduce a further medical report which purportedly existed and also her refusal to provide particulars and answers to interrogatories about her pre-existing medical conditions.

58     I should first say that the Defendant’s arguments at points were contradictory. For example, the Defendant argued that since the Plaintiff had not called either Dr Siow or Dr Peng, their reports were inadmissible and therefore there is no evidence of her injuries:

> The Plaintiff had refused to call the treating doctors…to adduce their respective reports and give evidence, and had thereby shielded them from cross-examination. Hence, the two reports are hearsay and inadmissible.

59     Yet, the Defendant _relied heavily_ on the contents of the same reports to argue that there was a break in the chain of causation. These two arguments could not be fairly reconciled. Either the reports were admissible or they were not. However, I will give the Defendant the benefit of the doubt and assume that these contradictory arguments were being made in the alternative.

60     The trial has been bifurcated. For the purposes of the trial on liability, I do not need to find that _all_ of the Plaintiff’s damages were caused by the Accident. However, in order to establish a cause of action in negligence, it must first be shown that _some_ loss had been caused, though the quantum of the loss can be assessed at a later stage (_Tan Woo Thian v PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 1 SLR 1166</span> at \[7\] (“_Tan Woo Thian_”)). In this case, there is no doubt in my mind that the Plaintiff was injured in the Accident and suffered _some_ loss, based on the following:

> (a)     The Plaintiff and Mr Sandosham’s evidence.

> (b)     The fact that the Plaintiff had visited the Singapore General Hospital’s Accident & Emergency department on the day of the Accident.

> (c)     Ms Chang’s AEIC where she stated that after the Accident, she had spoken to the Plaintiff who “complained of left leg pain and scratches on her bottom lip.”

> (d)     Mr Huang’s evidence that he observed the Plaintiff falling down.

61     In relation to the Defendant’s reliance on the medical reports, I would repeat what I said at \[28\] above – that the medical reports are not in evidence as neither doctor has been called. It would follow that I should not be looking at the contents of the medical reports.

62     But even if I was wrong, and the contents of the medical reports can be relied upon even though the doctors were not called as witnesses, the evidence supports a finding that the Plaintiff was injured after the Accident. This is clear from the following paragraph of Dr Siow’s Report:

> She was seen in the A&E department on the same day \[of the Accident\] where clinical examination showed bruising to her lower lip together with tenderness to the left / hip gluteal region. Hip range of motion was full actively and passively. She was treated as \[sic\] for a left hip contusion and referred to the orthopaedic specialist outpatient clinics.

63     The Defendant argued that the subsequent injuries recorded in the report (such as a fracture of the left iliac wing, which is a fracture to an area in the pelvic region) were only diagnosed when the Plaintiff went for further appointments and so it could not be said that these subsequent injuries were caused by the Accident.

64     For the purposes of the bifurcated trial on liability, it is not necessary for the Plaintiff to prove the full extent of her loss. She needs to only prove that _some_ loss had occurred. The Defendant may very well be right that the fracture was not caused by the Accident and if it can establish that during the assessment of damages, then the Plaintiff’s damages would be reduced. But that does not mean that liability in negligence is not established because the Plaintiff did at the very least suffer from a left hip contusion.

65     The effect of my decision that liability is established would mean that it would not be open to the Defendant to argue at the assessment of damages hearing that the Plaintiff’s damages should be zero. The Defendant is otherwise free to argue what the Plaintiff’s damages should be.

## Conclusion

66     For the reasons set out above, I entered interlocutory judgment in the Plaintiff’s favour at 100%. Costs of the trial were reserved to me as I will be hearing the assessment of damages.

## Leave to Appeal

67     On 26 July 2021, the Defendant filed an application seeking leave to appeal against my decision _vide_ MC/SUM 3536/2021. I heard parties on 27 August 2021.

68     The Defendant argued that there were _prima facie_ errors of law and there was a question of general principle to be decided for the first time.

69     The Defendant argued that there were _prima facie_ errors of law because:

> (a)     The court had “placed the burden \[of proof\] upon the Defendant and/or shifted the burden onto the Defendant.” The court had faulted the Defendant for inconsistencies in its case but had ignored the Plaintiff’s inconsistences and found that she had discharged her burden of proof notwithstanding the inconsistencies in her evidence.

> (b)     The court had either not applied or incorrectly applied the principles relating to burden of proof.

> (c)     The court had displaced the Plaintiff’s pleaded case and accepted an entirely different case that was not pleaded.

70     The Defendant argued that there was question of general principle to be decided for the first time in relation to the application of _Tan Woo Thian_ to personal injury claims, and that a decision from the High Court “on the application of the principles set out in _Tan Woo Thian_ insofar as it relates to a personal injury claim would greatly assist in clarifying the legal position”.

71     As the sum in dispute is less than $60,000, leave to appeal is required (s 21(1)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322)). The principles applicable to the grant of leave to appeal are not controversial. They can be summarised as follows (_Abdul Rahman bin Shariff v Abdul Salim bin Syed_ \[1999\] 3 SLR 138):

> (a)     Leave to appeal may be granted where the applicant is able (at \[31\]):

>> (i)       To demonstrate a _prima facie_ case of error of law that has a bearing on the decision of the trial court.

>> (ii)       To show that there is a question of law decided for the first time or a question of law of importance upon which a decision of a higher tribunal would be to the public advantage.

>> (iii)       To show a question of law on which there is a conflict of judicial authority and a pronouncement from a higher court in the judicial hierarchy is desirable.

> (b)     Leave of court should not be granted when there are mere questions of fact to be considered (at \[31\]). Where the argument was that there was an erroneous conclusion on the facts of the case, leave to appeal should be denied (at \[30\]).

72     Having carefully considered the Defendant’s arguments, I dismissed the application. Although apparently couched as errors of law, the Defendant’s arguments were really arguments disputing my conclusion on the facts. I have considered all the evidence put forth, including the Defendant’s evidence and the inconsistencies which the Defendant says permeates the Plaintiff’s evidence. I have set out my reasons for preferring the Plaintiff’s evidence over Mr Huang (see \[20\] to \[22\] above). I have set out my reasons for not being able to accept Mr Wong’s opinion evidence (see \[51\] to \[55\] above). I concluded that the Plaintiff had discharged her burden of establishing that the Accident occurred as pleaded.

73     However, even if there was an error (_eg_, I should have accepted Mr Huang’s evidence over the Plaintiff or I should have accepted Mr Wong’s opinion evidence), this was no more than an erroneous conclusion on the facts of the case. Leave cannot be granted on this basis.

74     The Defendant’s argument in relation to _Tan Woo Thian_ in its closing submissions was that the Plaintiff “must suffer the same fate as the appellant in _Tan Woo Thian_, for the simple reason that she has led no evidence to establish that the Defendant’s alleged breaches did in fact cause the types of losses she claims to have suffered.” Effectively, the Defendant argued that I had misapplied _Tan Woo Thian_, and that a correct application would have led to the conclusion that the Plaintiff had failed to establish causation. The question of law to be decided for the first time is how _Tan Woo Thian_ would apply to personal injury cases where the trial is bifurcated.

75     I disagree that I had misapplied _Tan Woo Thian_ or that there was a question of law to be decided for the first time arising from the application of _Tan Woo Thian_ to personal injury cases. Unlike the appellant in _Tan Woo Thian_, the Plaintiff had led evidence that she was injured as a result of the Accident (see \[60\] to \[62\] above). Even the Defendant’s witness Ms Chang had stated that after the Accident, the Plaintiff “complained of left leg pain and scratches on her bottom lip.” In _Tan Woo Thian_, the appellant failed to produce any evidence of the various losses he suffered, apart from bald assertions in his AEIC. _Tan Woo Thian_ does not compel the Plaintiff to prove the full extent of her loss at the bifurcated trial on liability. She only needs to prove _some_ loss. Given that the principles set out in _Tan Woo Thian_ are not novel and in fact follow a long line of authorities (see _eg_, _Salcon Ltd v United Cement Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 4 SLR(R) 353</span> at \[24\] and _Jurong Primewide Pte Ltd v Moh Seng Cranes Pte Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 360</span> at 77), there is no question of law to be decided for the first time arising out of the applicability of the principles in _Tan Woo Thian_ to personal injury claims.

76     MC/SUM 3536/2021 is therefore dismissed, with costs fixed at $800 (all in) to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.
