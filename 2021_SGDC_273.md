### District Judge Marvin Bay:

##### INTRODUCTION

### The charge

1       The accused person: Murugarajan A/L Munian (“Mr Murugarajan”), entered a guilty plea in respect of a single charge of trafficking of _methamphetamine_[^1] which was framed as follows:

> (_Mr Murugarajan is_) charged that (_he_), on 11 February 2020, at or about 5:33 p.m., in a vehicle bearing registration number JPF 3201 stationed near the drop-off point of Rivervale Plaza along Rivervale Lane, Singapore, did traffic in a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, by having in (_his_) possession for the purpose of **_trafficking two (2) packets containing not less than 248.2 grammes of crystalline substance which were analysed and found to contain_** **_not less than 166.99 grammes of methamphetamine_**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and (_he has_) thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and punishable under Section 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the said Act.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Applicable penalties for trafficking of methamphetamine

2       The offence of trafficking under section 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) carries a mandatory minimum term of five years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane for the lowest quantities, with an incremental step-up of penalties for higher quantities. The Second Schedule of the MDA provides for capital punishment to be imposed in instances where more than 250 grammes of _methamphetamine_ is trafficked. Below the capital cut-off point, the trafficking of a quantity of _methamphetamine_ of “not less than 167 grammes and not more than 250 grammes” will carry a **_maximum_** penalty of 30 years’ imprisonment or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane. It should also be noted that there is a **_minimum_** penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane in instance where “_not less than 167 grammes_” of methamphetamine is trafficked. _Per_ the charge of trafficking “_not less than 166.99 grammes of methamphetamine_” that he agreed to plead guilty to, Mr Murugarajan was able to avoid this critical cut-off point of 167 grammes for _methamphetamine_ trafficking, and consequently, he faced a **_maximum_** (rather than minimum) term of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Put in more precise terms, Mr Murugarajan was allowed to avoid a heavier penalty that he would have been liable for because of an agreement between the prosecution and defence for him to plead guilty to a reduced charge. The circumstances will be elaborated on further in these grounds.

### Background to the appeal

3       This an appeal was brought by Mr Murugarajan against my sentence of 14 years and nine months’ imprisonment, with 11 strokes of the cane. The sentence was backdated to Mr Murugarajan’s arrest on 11 February 2020. As can be discerned from the above, a highly relevant aspect of this case is the fact that Mr Murugarajan had pleaded guilty to a **_reduced_** trafficking charge involving his trafficking “_not less than 166.99 grammes[^2] of methamphetamine_”, which, as indicated above, carried a **_maximum_** term of imprisonment term of 20 years. This is despite the fact that the real aggregate amount assayed from the two bundles of crystalline substance found at the point of his arrest contained, in **_actuality, an aggregate of 168.44g_** of _methamphetamine_. For completeness, the two bundles of “_not less than 124.2g_” and “not less than _124.0g_” of crystalline substance found on in Murugarajan’s possession were found[^3] to contain respective quantities of **_84.39g_** and **_84.05g_** of _methamphetamine_, amounting to a 168.44g of the narcotic drug. Without the revision to the charge to reflect “_not less than 166.99g of methamphetamine_”, Mr Murugarajan would have faced a mandatory **_minimum_** of sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

### Application of full-spectrum sentencing

4       In view of the amount of _methamphetamine_ involved, Mr Murugarajan should have faced a sentence at the extreme-right end of the sentencing spectrum for the applicable band upon the reduced trafficking charge for trafficking “_not less than 166.9g of methamphetamine_” was set, even as he was spared the mandatory minimum term of 20 years’ imprisonment for the next band. To elaborate from the reference above, the 20-year imprisonment term would have been applicable as the **_starting point_** for the sentencing band applicable to the quantity he had **_factually_** trafficked, without the national downward adjustment limiting the quantity of narcotics afforded by the reduction of the charge.

### The accused faced an indicative starting sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment on the reduced trafficking charge

5       Notwithstanding the **_notional_** maximum sentence for the band of the reduced charge of under 167g of _methamphetamine_ being 20 years’ imprisonment, the starting **_baseline_** sentence at the farthest end of the band, for a quantum at the very brink of 167g of the narcotic drug, would be **_15 years’ imprisonment_** with caning. This baseline starting sentence is well established from case authority, notably from an extrapolation of principles discerned from the guideline judgment of _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”). _Vasentha_ involved the trafficking of _diamorphine_, where this case involves _methamphetamine_. The operating sentencing principles after a proportional conversion (determined as 1g of _diamorphine_ to be equivalent to 16.7g of _methamphetamine_).

### Quantity based sentencing schedule for first time diamorphine traffickers established in Vasentha v PP

6       In _Vasentha_, Sundaresh Menon CJ reiterated that the **_quantity_** of the drug concerned would be the principal factor in consideration in establishing the starting point for the sentencing of trafficking offenders. In this regard the honourable Chief Justice reiterated that courts “_should generally utilise the full spectrum of possible sentences_”[^4] when imposing penalties for drug trafficking cases before them. This would entail ensuring that “_indicative starting points would span the range of possible sentences but stop short of the statutory maximum sentence_”, which was a term of 20 years’ imprisonment with caning for the offending band Mr Murugarajan had pleaded guilty to.

7       In _Vasentha_, his Honour added that “_(I)n general, because of the importance of the degree of harm as a sentencing consideration, the starting points should be broadly proportional to the quantity of diamorphine (ie, the greater the quantity, the higher the sentence)”_, and proceeded to set out the following schedule showing the indicative starting points on this basis, for first time offenders trafficking in _diamorphine_, with incremental sentencing bands predicated on the quantity of the narcotic drug trafficked_[^5]_.

8       To be clear, these sentences were intended as indicative **_starting_** points, based only on the quantity of _diamorphine_. These was still room for adjustments where necessary to, for a more precise characterisation of an offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, where the case merited such. CJ Menon allowed for the possibility that _“(i)n a case where no adjustment is necessary, the indicative starting point may well be the appropriate sentence to be imposed._ Also, as the indicative starting points were not intended to be rigid or inflexible categories, his Honour added that _“(t)he precise sentence to be imposed in each case would depend on the specific circumstances of that case.”_

### Quantity based sentencing schedule for first time methamphetamine traffickers based on schedule set out in Vasentha v PP

9       In _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span>; <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 217</span> (“_Alan Loo_”), Chao Hick Tin JA proposed to hold, based on parity between the statutory sentencing ranges, that 1g of _diamorphine_ should be equivalent to 16.7g of _methamphetamine_, stating at \[17\]:

> _Indicative starting points where the drug trafficked is methamphetamine_

> 17    I am cognisant of the fact that the drug trafficked in _Vasentha_ was diamorphine whereas the drug in this case was methamphetamine. Trafficking one gram of diamorphine is of course not necessarily equivalent to trafficking one gram of methamphetamine. But I consider that it is possible to derive some sort of conversion scale, or “exchange rate”, so to speak, between diamorphine and methamphetamine. This is because the Second Schedule of the MDA prescribes the exact same minimum and maximum punishments for trafficking between 10g and 15g of diamorphine and trafficking between 167g and 250g of methamphetamine – the minimum is 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and the maximum is imprisonment for life or 30 years and 15 strokes of the cane. **_This means that, all other things being equal, an offender who traffics between 10g and 15g of diamorphine is to be considered _****as culpable** **as** **_a person who traffics between 167g and 250g of methamphetamine. Doing the arithmetic, the culpability of an offender who traffics one gram of diamorphine is equivalent to the culpability of an identically-situated offender who traffics 16.7g of methamphetamine_**.

10     Pursuant to this reasoning a similar tabular structure for equivalent sentencing bands for _methamphetamine_ can be extrapolated in the following terms:

### Premises established

11     The point of the foregoing in the introductory part of these grounds is to establish the following premises:

> (a)     The accused has been accorded a considerable concession in being able to plead on a reduced charge of trafficking 166.99g of _methamphetamine_ where he would have faced a mandatory **_minimum_** sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment had he been convicted on a charge for trafficking the amount actually analysed of 168.44g of _methamphetamine_.

> (b)     The case authority of _Vasentha_ has placed the starting-point sentencing baseline for 9.99g of _diamorphine_ at 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane.

> (c)     The case authority of _Alan Loo_ had proposed an extrapolated ‘exchange-rate” to draw the equivalency of 1g of _diamorphine_ to 16.7g of _methamphetamine_ as a measurement unit in sentencing_._

> (d)     In view of the above the starting-point sentencing baseline for the “_at least 166.99g_” of methamphetamine trafficked by Mr Murugarajan should be computed to be **_15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane_**.

> (e)     While adjustments were certainly mandated to address the individual circumstances of each case, _Vasentha_ and other cases authorities have made it plain that the quantity of drugs trafficked is still the most important determinant in sentencing, this is so because the amount trafficked is closely corelated to the potential **_harm_** that the drugs would cause. From these pronouncements, it is clear that, absent truly exceptional circumstances, there should not be any substantial deviation from the quantum-based starting point. Indeed, _Vasentha_ has made it patent that it would also be entirely **_proper_** to mete the starting-point indicative sentence, in a paucity of presenting circumstances which might justify an adjustment.

### Prosecution’s and defence’s respective positions on sentence

12     The prosecution had asked for an uplift of three months over the indicative sentence of 15 years, principally on that the accused had committed the offence with view to a pecuniary reward and that he had also sought to conceal the two packages. The defence on the other hand had asked for a markedly lower sentence, making several revisions to their sentencing position from 13 years imprisonment[^6] with nine strokes of the cane, to 13 years’ and six months’ imprisonment with ten strokes of the cane[^7] to proposing that the sentence must be “_less_ (than) the _14_ (years’ imprisonment) _meted out in_ (a cited case)”[^8]

### The Appeal

13     This appeal is against the sentence I had meted out of 14 years’ and nine months’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. The accused has deemed the sentence to be manifestly excessive and contended that the sentence should be similar to that of _Public Prosecutor v Kogilan Saravanan[^9] (“Kogilan”)_, which counsel had “_recently handled_”[^10] The accused there had received a sentence of 13 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane for the offence of trafficking “_not less than 9.99g of diamorphine_”.

14     I will not pre-empt my analysis of the case with extraneous discussion here, save to say at this juncture that _Kogilan_ was an unreported decision. The case was not appealed, and no formal grounds were ever given. _Kogilan_ thus had little if any precedential value. (_Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terrence_ \[2020\] SGHC at \[86\]). Notwithstanding this, I will juxtapose the instant case with _Kogilan_ in the interest of ensuring consistency in sentencing_._ To this end, I will demonstrate the material differences I had found between the two cases, not least the stark disparity of the ages of Mr Murugarajan in the instant case and the accused in _Kogilan_.

### Statement of Facts

15     In the Statement of Facts which Mr Murugarajan accepted without qualification, he gave a detailed account of his role in trafficking the quantity of _methamphetamine_ from Malaysia to his counterparty in Singapore a certain Romzy Bin Rafa’at, as well as background information on his preparatory acts. The Statement of Facts[^11] is set out _verbatim_ to allow a full appreciation of the specific facts Mr Murugarajan had actually pleaded guilty to, with passages relevant to his sentencing highlighted.

> 1    The accused is one Murugarajan A/L Munian, a 41-year-old Malaysian male bearing (_ID stated_) (D.O.B. 6 December 1979). At the material time, the accused was working as a forklift driver and was driving a car bearing registration number “JPF 3201” (the “car”).

> 2    The co-accused is one Romzy Bin Rafa’at, a 47-year-old Singaporean (D.O.B. 30 October 1973). At the material time, the co-accused was working in odd jobs as a mover and forklift driver.

> II.    FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGE (DAC-903145-2020)

> 3    Sometime in February 2020, an unidentified Malaysian male (“A1”) asked the accused to deliver **_two bundles of drugs and one bottle of cough syrup to the co-accused in Singapore in exchange for payment of RM 1600_**. The accused agreed to this arrangement and was accordingly paid RM 1600. A1 also informed the **_accused that he would be collecting payment of S$5,800 from the co-accused for the drugs_**.

> 4    On 11 February 2020 in the morning, the accused left Malaysia with two black-taped bundles (the “bundles”) and a bottle of black liquid (the “bottle”) in his car. At about noon, the accused reached Singapore and drove to Blk 227C Compassvale Dr, Singapore (“Blk 227C”), to meet the co-accused. While on the way to Blk 227C, **_the accused placed the bundles under the red carpet of the floorboard of the driver seat, and the bottle on the floorboard of the front passenger seat. The accused did so in order to conceal these items._** The accused had pressed his fingers on the bundles and felt that they contained something stone-like. From this, the accused knew that the bundles contained “Ice” (i.e. street name for methamphetamine).

> 5    The accused reached Blk 227C at around 5pm. Shortly thereafter, the co-accused got into the car and asked the accused for the items. The accused then lifted up the floor mat of the driver seat and showed the bundles to the co-accused.

> 6    The co-accused told the accused that he needed to withdraw money to make payment of S$5,800 to the accused. The accused then drove to Rivervale Plaza, Singapore. At around 5.25pm, the co-accused alighted at the drop-off point and went to the automated teller machine at NTUC Fairprice in Rivervale Plaza. Whilst waiting for the co-accused, the accused then drove for a short while before parking near the drop-off point of Rivervale Plaza along Rivervale Lane, Singapore.

> 7     **_At around 5.33pm, a party of CNB officers arrested the accused. Shortly thereafter, the accused informed SGT Yogaraj S/O Ragunathan Pillay of the location of the bundles and the bottle. They conducted a search of the car and recovered the bundles_** (subsequently marked as “D1” and “D2” respectively) **_from under the red carpet of the floorboard of the driver seat_** and the bottle (subsequently marked as “E1”) from the floorboard of the front passenger seat.

> 8    Exhibits “D1” and “D2” were cut open, and each of them was found to contain a clear plastic packet of crystalline substance. The two clear plastic packets were subsequently marked “D1A1” and “D2A1” respectively. They were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis, and found to contain the following:

>> 1.    (_identification number_) D1A1 One packet of not less than 124.2 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found **_to contain not less than 84.39 grams of methamphetamine_**

>> 2.    (identification number) D2A1 One packet of not less than 124.0 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to **_contain not less than 84.05 grams of methamphetamine_**

> 9    The respective HSA certificates listed at \[8\] above were issued by Dr. Ong Mei Ching, an analyst with the HSA, and are annexed hereto as Annex A and B respectively.

> 10    In total, the drug exhibits listed at \[8\] above were found to contain not less than 166.99 grams of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev. Ed. 2008) (“MDA”). The accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to traffic in methamphetamine.

> 11    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused, on 11 February 2020, at or about 5:33 p.m., in a vehicle bearing registration number JPF 3201 stationed near the drop-off point of Rivervale Plaza along Rivervale Lane, Singapore, did traffic in a Class ‘A’ controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, by having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking two (2) packets containing not less than 248.2 grams of crystalline substance which were analysed and found to contain not less than 166.99 grams of methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and punishable under Section 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the said Act.

### Antecedent history

16     The accused had no prior criminal antecedents.[^12]

**_Mitigation_**

17     Counsel submitted a detailed mitigation plea which, in my opinion, tended to downplay Mr Murugarajan’s culpability. The main thrusts were Murugarajan’s role as a “_mere courier_”, and that he had not been “_involved in directing or organising drug trade on a commercial scale_”.[^13]Counsel added that the accused “_did not have a regular clientele and had not trafficked in a variety of drugs_”. Counsel contended that Mr Murugarajan “_was not involved in a drug syndicate_”. I would observe that counsel’s assertion was not actually disproven, but it was nevertheless not explicitly the prosecution’s case that the accused was part of a syndicate, notwithstanding the quantity of drugs found, and the manner of the two bundles being packaged in practically **_equal_** weights of 124 grammes of crystalline substance. While the prosecution has cast Mr Murugarajan’s role to be higher than the most **_basic_** form of courier activity of simply conveying the drugs from point to point, given that he was also involved in **_collecting_** payment as well, the DPP had never characterised his elevated level of activity to identify the accused as a syndicate member. I therefore placed no weight at all on this aspect as a factor in sentencing.

### Contention that the accused did not take active steps to avoid detection

18     Other aspects of the mitigation plea focused the absence of aggravating factors. Counsel listed four such factors which were beyond dispute, including the accused person’s absence of antecedents, that there were no other charges to take into consideration, that he had only trafficked in a single type of controlled drug, and that the accused had not committed the offence while he was on bail. The only other factor which attracted a substantial level of dispute was counsel’s assertion that “_Murugarajan did not take active steps to avoid detection_”.[^14]

### Explicit admission to concealment in Statement of Facts

19     In my view, this did not comport with the admitted facts showing that the accused had “_placed the bundles_ (containing methamphetamine) _under the red carpet of the floorboard of the driver seat_”. For good measure to demonstrate Mr Murugarajan’s intent to conceal his illicit cargo, he had also placed “_the bottle_ (of black liquid that he had been asked to convey to his counterparty in Singapore) _on the floorboard of the front passenger seat_”. This was bolstered with a specific reference that “**_The accused did so in order to conceal the items_**”.[^15] I will reserve the specific submissions on this area to the analysis later in these grounds, as I will need to set out the factual matrix of _Kogilan’s_ case to allow a contextual understanding of the points counsel was making.

### Comparison with Kogilan’s case

20     To be clear, I had already expressed my view that _Kogilan_ itself, as an unappealed case from a district court. did not hold any significant precedential value. My reason for referencing this case is because of counsel’s own indexing of that case, and claiming certain **_parallels_**, with the present circumstances concerning Mr Murugarajan. In all, defence and prosecution made over 50 references to _Kogilan_ in the transcript for the instant case.

21     While ever mindful of the principle that “_unreported cases carry little if any precedential value because they are unreasoned_”, as expressed in _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terrence_ \[2020\] SGHC at \[86\], I have embarked on an analysis of _Kogilan_, noting it involved the same genre of offence, and where counsel has claimed parallels in the respective factual matrices, where the accused there used a broadly similar _modus operandi_. Where counsel had made me aware that _Kogilan_ had recently been dealt with in a different district court, a juxtaposition of _Kogilan_ with the instant case will help demonstrate that there has been due care in the deliberation of Mr Murugarajan’s sentence to yield a consistently just and appropriate sentence, in keeping with the specific merits of the case. Simply stated_, Kogilan’s_ case would be a useful **_reference point_** for me to explain the bases for Mr Murugarajan’s sentence.

22     This principle of consistency in sentencing was stated by Menon CJ in _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> where his Honour had held that ‘_Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system. This is rooted in the notion that all are equal before the law…To put it simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished_’. The gist of counsel’s arguments was that the accused here should receive a sentence that was equal to (or even shorter) than that meted out in _Kogilan_. While I would naturally accept as a basic premise that, all things being equal, like cases ought receive like sentences, my eventual analysis was that there were aspects of _Kogilan’s_ case which were **_materially different_** from the instant case, and also that these were sufficient to **_elevate_** Mr Murugarajan’s level of culpability from that in the former case.

### Statement of Facts for Kogilan’s case

23     To allow a comparison with Mr Murugarajan’s case, the circumstances of _Kogilan’s case_ as disclosed by the Statement of Facts set out, are now set out. The Statement of Facts states[^16]:

> The accused is Kogilan Saravanan (“Kogilan”), a 24-year-old male Malaysian national bearing FIN no. (_id number stated_) (D.O.B.: 1 November 1996).

> 2.    The co-accused is Yap Guan Lye (“Yap”), a 65-year-old male Singaporean bearing (id stated) (D.O.B.: 22 September 1955).

> **_Background leading to Kogilan’s arrest_**

> 3.    On 10 October 2018, sometime before 7.10am, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) proceeded to Yap’s address at Block 105 Teck Whye Lane, Singapore (“Block 105”) pursuant to a tip received that there was going to be a drug transaction between the accused persons.

> 4.    At about 7.10am the same day, Yap was spotted at the void deck of Block 105. At the same time, **_Kogilan was seen entering the carpark of Block 105 on a Malaysian registered motorcycle (registration no. JRS 4849) (the “motorcycle”) and alighting from his motorcycle. Kogilan then walked over to Yap, retrieved a green box file (the “green box file”) from his bag and handed it to Yap._** The two thereafter parted ways, and Kogilan rode the motorcycle out of the carpark, whilst Yap took the lift up Block 105 to his unit at #XXX (the “unit”).

> 5.    At about 7.20am, Kogilan was arrested on his motorcycle in front of Block 26 Teck Whye Lane by the first team of CNB officers. **_He was found with, inter alia, one black haversack containing $8,300 in cash which was seized for investigations._**

> 6.    At around 7.25 am, Yap was arrested by the other team of CNB officers near the kitchen window in his unit. When the CNB officers first entered the unit, Yap ran to his kitchen window and flung the green box file as well as a smaller ziplock of heroin (street name for diamorphine) out of his unit window. These items landed on the grass patch below Yap’s unit window. As such, at about 7.30 am, the CNB officers escorted Yap down to the grass patch below his unit window and recovered, inter alia, the following items that were thrown out of the window by Yap: (_Three plastic packets and one ziplock bag containing a brown granular substance and a broken green file_).

> 7.    Kogilan and Yap were then escorted to CNB Central Police Division Headquarters for further investigations.

> **_Facts pertaining to the Charge (DAC-931789-2019)_**

> 8.-10.    (_The brown granular substance found in the three plastic packets and the ziplock bag are found to contain not less than 1,255 grams of granular/powdery substance, and found, upon analysis, to contain not less than 12.68 grams of diamorphine_.)

> 11.    Investigations revealed that prior to his arrest, Kogilan, who was in need of money, approached a moneylender in Malaysia who he referred to as “Anneh” for assistance. “Anneh” informed Kogilan that he would be able to loan him RM1,500 **_if Kogilan assisted him to bring some box files into Singapore and hand them to Yap._** Kogilan agreed.

> 12.    Pursuant to “Anneh’s” instructions, Kogilan made two deliveries to Yap at Block 105 on 5 October 2018 and 8 October 2018. During both these deliveries, Yap would hand Kogilan S$4,500 in cash in return for a box file. Yap would thereafter open the box files, which contained heroin.

> 13.    On “Anneh’s” instructions, Kogilan would then proceed to bring the cash back to Johor Bahru, Malaysia where he would convert it into Malaysian ringgit. Kogilan would then be allowed to a keep a portion of the cash as payment for the delivery, and hand over the remaining sum to one of “Anneh’s” runners. Kogilan was paid RM1,500 and RM900 for these two deliveries respectively.

> 14.    Subsequently, sometime before 10 October 2018, Kogilan reached out to “Anneh” again and indicated that he was in need of money and wanted to borrow RM3,000. “Anneh” agreed to loan Kogilan RM2,000 and pay him an additional RM1,000 on the condition that he assisted “Anneh” to bring a box file containing diamorphine into Singapore and hand it to Yap. Kogilan agreed.

> 15.     **_As such, on 10 October 2018, at about 5.50am, Kogilan reached the Johor Bahru customs where he met up with one of “Anneh’s” runners who handed him the green box file for delivery to Yap_**. The green box file contained the three plastic packets of heroin marked “A1”. **_These three plastic packets contained not less than 9.99g of diamorphine in total_**.

> 16.     **_Kogilan kept the green box file in his bag and travelled into Singapore, where he met up with Yap at the void deck of Block 105 at about 7.10am the same day. Upon meeting up with Yap, Kogilan removed the green box file from his bag and handed it to Yap, who paid him S$8,300 in cash in return for the diamorphine_**. Kogilan was then arrested whilst leaving Block 105.

> 17.    Kogilan is not authorized to traffic in diamorphine under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. By delivering not less than 9.99g of diamorphine, a Class A controlled to Yap, Kogilan has committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA.

> \[Emphasis added\]

24     Kogilan Saravanan (“Mr Kogilan[^17]”) thus faced a reduced charge of trafficking not less than 9.99g of diamorphine, where the Health Sciences Authority’s Analytical Toxicology Lab had in fact uncovered not less than 12.68g of _diamorphine_ from the contents of the box file.

### Age as a sentencing factor in Kogilan’s case

25     It should be noted that Mr Kogilan was born on 1 November 1996, and hence would have been only **_21 years and 11 months_** old at the date he was arrested for the diamorphine trafficking charge on 10 October 2018. The mitigatory ground of Mr Kogilan’s youth was not lost to his counsel (also Mr Hariharan in that case) who had, in his mitigation plea, emphasized the accused’s “_young age_” and urged the court “_to consider that_ (Mr Kogilan) _was just 21 years old when he committed the offence_”. Counsel in that case had asked for a sentence of 13 years’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. The prosecution in a succinct address had also seen a basis to titrate downward from the starting point of 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane from the _Vasentha_ framework:

> 5    In the present case, given the large amount of diamorphine involve (9.99g), the indicative starting point would be a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. The accused had also trafficked the drugs for personal, financial gain.

> 6\. However, the Prosecution is mindful that the accused’s culpability falls on the lower end of the scale insofar that he performed only a limited function under direction. Taking this into consideration, as well as the fact that the accused has pleaded guilty which is evidence of his remorse, a downward adjustment in his sentence can be made. Accordingly, the **_Prosecution submits that a sentence of 14 years and 10 strokes of the cane would be commensurate with the accused’s overall culpability_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Other differentiating aspects of Kogilan’s case

26     A feature of the case which was also notable would be the fact that Mr Kogilan had **_been given_** the drugs in question that had been pre-packed into a box file, which was in turn placed on a bag that he had apparently kept on his person. Mr Kogilan’s task included successfully navigating the Singapore customs and immigration checkpoint on his Malaysian registered motorcycle. On the facts, Mr Kogilan had apparently not even directly **_handled_** the drugs, as the arrangement had been for the box file to be opened by his counterparty Yap Guan Lye, upon his delivery to the latter in Singapore.

27     The difference between the situation in _Kogilan_ and the instant case in this respect is quite stark, with Mr Murugarajan admitting to not just handling the bundles, but also pressing the bundles with his fingers to feel their ‘_stone-like_’ consistency, and even **_hiding_** them under the carpeting of the floorboard of the driver’s seat. The facts disclose that Mr Murugarajan was fully aware that he was handling _methamphetamine_, and conscious of the mass and heft of the crystalline substance that he was trafficking, although perhaps not that they would yield 168.44g of methamphetamine on analysis. For ease of reference, the salient passage from the Statement of Facts[^18] is set out below:

> While on the way to Blk 227C (_to meet the co-accused_), the accused placed the bundles (_of drugs_) under the red carpet of the floorboard of the driver seat, and the bottle (_of black liquid_) on the floorboard of the front passenger seat. The accused did so in order to conceal these items. The accused had pressed his fingers on the bundles and felt that they contained something stone-like. From this, the accused knew that the bundles contained “Ice” (i.e. street name for methamphetamine).

### Kogilan’s unsophisticated manner of trafficking suggested naivete

28     The fact that Mr Kogilan would simply undertake a serious offence without checking in the contents, and bearing the drugs, enclosed in a box file, in a bag which was itself borne in **_plain sight_** on his person (since there is no indication that he had stowed away his bag on any part of the motorcycle) does indicate a very considerable level of intrepidity and **_naivete_**, which one might circumstantially ascribe to callowness of youth. While the precise dimensions of the bag and box file were not stated in the tendered documents, the placing of the latter in the former receptacle seemed unsophisticated and risky, especially where Mr Kogilan had been required to make his way past the customs checkpoint, where any odd bulge or irregular shape that might be discerned from his bag could have given him away to an alert officer. Mr Murugarajan, on the other hand, already past 40 years of age, and a married father of five children[^19], had the cognitive wherewithal to take the precautionary measures described above.

29     For completeness, the co-accused Yap Guan Lye (“Mr Yap”) in _Kogilan’s_ case, who was aged 63 at the time of his arrest, was not offered the concession of any reduced charge, and upon the rejection of his counsel’s representations to the Attorney General’s Chambers, the case had been transferred to the High Court for Mr Yap to stand trial for a capital charge of trafficking 20.43g of _diamorphine_, and a lesser charge of possession of 19.12g of _methamphetamine_. To be clear, there is no question of Mr Yap’s greater culpability as the co-accused had been charged with trafficking of a quantity higher than the 12.68g of _diamorphine_ delivered by Mr Kogilan.

30     In respect of the single proceeded charge[^20] under section 5(1)(a) of the MDA, Mr Kogilan was sentenced on 27 April 2021, and received a sentence of **_13 years’ and six months’ imprisonment_**, along with ten strokes of the cane, with his sentence backdated to 11 October 2018[^21].

### Prosecution’s position on sentence for the instant case

31     Returning now to Mr Murugarajan’s case, the learned DPP had cited _Vasentha_, where the honourable Chief Justice had established starting points for sentencing premised from the quantity of drugs trafficked, and where subsequent authorities which clarified and built on the sentencing framework, to explain the prosecution’s position that the starting sentence for Mr Murugarajan’s trafficking of 166.99g of _methamphetamine_ should be “_at least 15 years’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane_”.[^22]

32     The learned DPP expounded on the further steps in the prosecution’s analysis which would, in their view, justify an **_uplift_** of **_three months’_** imprisonment above the indicative sentence for a final sentence of 15 years and three months’ imprisonment with caning of 11 strokes:

> 5.    … Thereafter, the actual sentence to be imposed will be adjusted from the indicative starting points based on the culpability of the accused, and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors (see \[49\] to \[76\] of _Vasentha_). A factor that increases the accused’s culpability is where the accused was “_motivated by financial or other advantage, whether operating as part of a drug syndicate or alone (eg, to sustain offender’s own drug habits_)”[^23] (emphasis added). An example of an aggravating factor is where the accused had attempted to conceal or dispose of evidence of the offence.[^24]

> 6.    In the present case, an uplift of 3 months’ imprisonment ought to be applied to account for: a. **_the accused’s financial motivation in trafficking in the drug exhibits_** (to receive payment of RM1600 for the delivery); and b. **_the accused’s attempt to conceal the bundles under the floor mat of the driver seat_**.

> 7.    In this regard, the accused’s plea of guilt has already been taken into account in submitting on the uplift.

> 8.    The Prosecution therefore submits for a sentence of at least 15 years’ and 3 months’ imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane.

> \[Emphasis in bold italics added\]

### Defence’s arguments why the accused should receive a sentence that was the same or even lower than Kogilan’s case

33     Counsel argued that _Kogilan_ and Mr Murugarajan was “_on the exact same facts_” and proceeded to venture that there were ‘_even less aggravating facts I would say_”[^25], before again reiterating that “_the facts are exactly the same, there is no difference_”.[^26] This appeal to commonality appeared to be an attempt to inveigle a sentence similar to the 13 year and six-month term of imprisonment that the accused in _Kogilan_ had received, which was, of course, a full year-and-a-half from the indicative starting point. Counsel made this quite plain when he reiterated again to “_submit that a sentence similar to what was ordered in Kogilan Saravanan is the correct sentence in this case, taking into account all of the precedents that_ (he had_) cited and the submissions (_he had_) made”[^27]_

34     I will merely state that counsel had been rather selective in identifying certain similarities in the _modus operandi_ and declaring that the facts were exactly the same, attaching a **_consequential expectation_** that the sentence should, following the dictates of consistency in sentencing, also be the same. I was of the view that such an exercise in ‘_cherry picking_’ **_similarities_** and ignoring obvious **_differences_**, which might either be aggravating factors or plain differentiations in the manner of offending, with possible implications in **_culpability_** for the purpose of sentencing, was inherent unsound and unjustified. Some of these have been alluded to in the foregoing, and I will elaborate further in latter part of these grounds.

## ANALYSIS

### Whether the accused had taken active steps to conceal the offence and whether this ought be considered as a culpability factor or as an aggravating factor

35     On the DPPs identification of Mr Murugarajan’s “_attempt to conceal the bundles under the floor mat of the driver’s seat_” as an “_aggravating factor”_[^28], learned counsel had protested that there would be no basis to deem Mr Murugarajan’s actions to amount to an aggravating factor, as he had not undertaken any “_active steps to conceal the drugs_”. Counsel had taken a passage from _Public Prosecutor_ v _Muhammad Ikrimah bin Muhammad Adrian Rogelio Gelaura_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 107</span> (“_Ikrimah_”) where Aedit Abdullah J had expressed his view that “…_not all attempts to conceal drugs should be regarded as an aggravating factor. It is inherent in almost all importation offences for the drugs to be concealed_”.

36     In my judgment, the opposing contentions should be weighed against Mr Murugarajan’s specific admission to having “_placed the bundles_ (containing methamphetamine) _under the red carpet of the floorboard of the driver seat_” in the Statement of Facts[^29]. On the facts disclosed, I am satisfied from the facts disclosed that Mr Murugarajan made a **_deliberate_** attempt to conceal the packages knowing the nature of their contents, and hence hide the fact that he was trafficking drugs.

37     A close reading of the relevant passage in _Vasentha_ will be helpful in parsing the difference between an accused person’s actions which would go towards an analysis on **_culpability_**, and which ought be considered at the next stage of considering **_aggravating_** and mitigating factors. In _Vasentha_ the honourable Chief Justice had held:

> 50    In my judgment, the inquiry into the offender’s culpability would require a holistic assessment of all the circumstances. **_This may include such considerations as whether special efforts were made to avoid detection_** (see, eg, PP v Mohamed Sohaili bin Mohamed Supri <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGDC 289</span> (“Sohaili”) (S/No 12 of the table) at \[22\]; as well as Kovalan (S/No 23 of the table), where the district judge considered that it was appropriate to increase the sentence given that the accused had tried to conceal the drugs to avoid detection (at \[19\]).

> 51    Having regard to the past cases, I formulate a list of indicia for assessing an offender’s culpability as follows

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.04%"> <col width="66.96%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Indicia</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Higher</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">• Directing or organising drug trade on a commercial scale (eg, having regular clientele or offering wide variety of drugs)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">• Involving others in the operation whether by pressure, influence, intimidation or reward</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">• Being motivated by financial or other advantage, whether operating as part of a drug syndicate or alone (eg, to sustain offender’s own drug habits)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">• <b><em>Taking active steps to avoid detection of the offence</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lower</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">• Performing only a limited function under direction</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">• Being engaged by pressure, coercion and intimidation, or <b><em>being involved through naivety and exploitation</em></b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> 52    This is a non-exhaustive list that is merely illustrative and should be developed with the accretion of our case law. Adjustment for aggravating and mitigating factors

> 53     **_The next step in the sentencing process_**, having taken into account the quantity of diamorphine and the culpability of the offender, would be to adjust the sentence to reflect the **_aggravating and mitigating factors_** that apply in the case at hand.

> Aggravating factors

> 54    I start with the main circumstances that have been recognised by the courts as aggravating in drug trafficking cases. These include:

>> (a)    the presence of relevant antecedents;

>> (b)    offences taken into consideration and the offender’s involvement in other offences;

>> (c)    the commission of an offence on bail;

>> (d)     **_the attempt to conceal or dispose of evidence of the offence;_** and

>> (e)    trafficking in a variety of drugs.

>> \[Emphasis added\]

38     A close examination of the framework would show that an accused “_taking active steps to avoid detection of the offence_” should be assessed with higher **_culpability_**, whereas any “_attempt to conceal or dispose of evidence of the offence_” would count towards **_aggravation_**. This distinction in fact does **_not_** favour Mr Murugarajan’s situation as the culpability assessment occurs at a **_higher_** order in the sequence for the evaluative process, with the consideration for aggravation or mitigation at a **_subsequent_** step of the sentencing analysis. Indeed the culpability assessment is a critical assessment in assessing the nature and extent of Mr Murugarajan’s offending, coming only secondary to the primary **_foundational_** step of basing an indicative starting point based on the quantity of drugs involved.

39     Attempts to dispose of evidence of the drug offence[^30] would come in as an aggravating factor in the subsequent analysis, to allow an adjustment on a tentative sentencing point that has already been plotted from the quantitative and culpability analyses. The rationale is clear as such acts of attempted concealment or disposal of evidence of the crime only come in at the peri-offence (i.e. while offence is being committed) or post-offence stage (e.g. by flushing trafficked drugs down a toilet bowl into the sewerage system when arrest is imminent with an arresting party presenting at the door), whereas the taking of active steps to avoid detection of the offence would go to the heart of the offence itself, evidencing premeditation and planning, as well as possibly showing a level of independence and discretion in the making of decisions of how and where to hide the drugs. There is no issue of disposal of evidence in either case, as Mr Kogilan had already delivered the _diamorphine_ when he was arrested (and it was Mr Yap who had made a bid to dispose of his combined stash of drugs), and Mr Murugarajan had been arrested after he had parked his car, and thus would not have been availed any opportunity to deal with the _methamphetamine_ that was still in the vehicle he had driven, even if he were so inclined.

### Why a relatively higher level of culpability should be accorded against the accused in the instant case

40     Using _Kogilan_ as a foil (since the defence is using the sentence imposed there as an acceptable sentence in this case), Mr Murugarajan appeared to have been allowed far greater autonomy in planning where and how he would hide the drugs, given that he had been afforded a chance to handle the packages, and apparently full discretion to choose where he would secret them within the more capacious confines of a motor vehicle, where Mr Kogilan was given a box file which he which he had to perilously convey by a bag from a more visually exposed motorcycle. Given Mr Kogilan’s situation, where he was not to open the box file, and which was only opened by the counterparty; Mr Yap, upon conveyance, it is entirely conceivable that he had limited awareness of the quantity he (Mr Kogilan) was trafficking, save a hint from the amount of money that he had collected. Hence, while there was a level of commonality in the _modi operandi_ in the two cases, the circumstances are readily distinguishable in Mr Murugarajan’s active concealment, which demonstrated planning, pre-meditation, and freedom of action, which were not features of _Kogilan’s_ case. Given this, Mr Murugarajan’s culpability would properly be assessed to be at a greater level that Mr Kogilan. Further, the discussion above would allow room for a circumstantial case that Mr Kogilan, then aged 21, had become “_involved through naivety and exploitation_”, which would be a factor justifying a reduction of his culpability.

### A contextualised reading of the cited passage in Ikrimah

41     Addressing now learned counsel’s contention where he had cited the pronouncement in _Ikrimah_ that “_not all attempts to conceal drugs should be regarded as an aggravating facto_r”[^31], I would agree with the prosecution’s contention[^32] that _Ikrimah_, which concerned _(inter alia_) an **_importation_** of “not less than 249.99g of _methamphetamine_’ an offence under section 7 of the MDA, addressed situations which were more congruent to **_importation_** of controlled drugs rather than for the offence of **_trafficking_** under section 5 of the MDA. This must be so given the clear stipulation in _Vasentha_ that ‘_taking active steps to avoid detection of the offence_” was indeed within the field of _indicia_ militating for greater culpability.

42     A careful reading of the entire passage in _Ikrimah_ will yield a more nuanced understanding of what Aedit Abdullah J intended, which was to caution against an unthinking finding of aggravation in every instance of concealment, **_without_** first considering if this aspect of the case had **_already_** been factored into considerations of planning and premeditation in assessing culpability in importation cases, and hence fall inadvertently into the trap of “**_double-counting”_**, and overweighing the offender’s culpability (if the fact of concealment were to be peremptorily ‘_tacked on_’ as an aggravating factor). Importation cases are especially susceptible to such “_double-counting_”, given that concealment would be an almost universal feature of such illicit drug importation across borders, if the nefarious enterprise were to have any prospect of success. The context is quite clear in Justice Abdullah’s framing of the premise in the preceding paragraph[^33] of _Ikrimah_ is set out:

> 53    The Prosecution argued that the fact that the Accused had personally concealed the imported drugs in the car was a **_separate aggravating_** **_factor_**, **_over and above_** **_indicating that the Accused had_** **_premeditated and planned_** the commission of the offence (\[19\] above). Hence, **_the Prosecution’s case seems to be that concealment of imported drugs ultimately counts as_** **_two aggravating factors._**

> 54     **_However, not all attempts to conceal drugs should be regarded as an aggravating factor._** It is inherent in almost all importation offences for the drugs to be concealed. There are hardly any accused persons who would import drugs into Singapore by placing the drugs openly on the car seat or walking into Singapore with the drugs in his hand in a transparent plastic bag. **_Accused persons will naturally conceal the drugs that they intend to import. Treating all forms of concealment as an aggravating factor would lead to the conclusion that all, or almost all, offences of importation are aggravated._**

> 55    Attempts to conceal the drugs being **_imported_** should only be regarded as an aggravating factor where the circumstances suffice to distinguish them from typical **_importation_** offences, such as when they are being concealed in an unusually sophisticated manner to avoid detection. An example of this can be seen in _Kalangie_, as was raised by the Defence (\[31\] above).

> 56    Nevertheless, the lack of concealment and/or the lack of sophisticated concealment are not mitigating factors, but are at best neutral.

> 57    In the present case, while the Defence described the Accused’s concealment of the drugs as not being sophisticated, he did **_hide the drugs in the boot_**, **_which was a clear attempt to evade detection._** It may not have succeeded, but such failure could neither absolve nor mitigate.

> \[Emphasis added\]

43     Taking a cue from the final reproduced paragraph, I would only observe that if hiding drugs in a boot can be deemed “_a clear attempt to evade detection_”, it must necessarily follow that hiding drug parcels under the floormats should be construed to show Mr Murugarajan “_taking active steps to avoid detection of the offence_”.

### Accused’s ‘co-operative’ behaviour in a situation where he had no other viable options

44     Counsel had attempted to characterise Mr Murugarajan to have been co-operative with police. In his own words, defence counsel contended[^34]:

> When the CNB officers approached my client, he told them exactly where the drugs were. This is not a case where they had to bring it to Woodlands Checkpoint for backscatter imaging to retrieve the drugs.

45     From a situational point of view, Mr Murugarajan’s purported co-operation was the only rational course of action he could have taken. Notably, he had at the time been apprehended while outside his car. To recapitulate, the sequence of events preceding his arrest begins after he was told by the co-accused, Romzy Bin Rafa’at (“Mr Romzy”); who was the counterparty of the trafficking transaction, that the latter needed to withdraw money to make payment of S$5,800 to Mr Murugarajan. The duo had proceeded to Rivervale Plaza. At around 5.25pm, Mr Romzy alighted at the drop-off point and had gone to the automated teller machine at NTUC Fairprice in Rivervale Plaza. As he waited for Mr Romzy, Mr Murugarajan had driven for a short while before parking near the drop-off point of Rivervale Plaza along Rivervale Lane. It was while he was out of the vehicle at 5.33pm, that he had been apprehended by a party of CNB officers. The Statement of Facts records that the accused informed had ‘_shortly thereafter_’ informed CNB Sergeant Yogaraj S/O Ragunathan Pillay of the location of the drug bundles and the bottle of ‘_dark liquid_’.

46     It would be quite patent from the situation set out above that Mr Murugarajan had limited options. He was a Malaysian national who had entered Singapore for the express purpose of trafficking drugs, and had been on foot, at the time of his arrest, and hence cut off from the vehicle he had come in with, and where the drugs were hidden. It would have been clear to him from the fact he had been interdicted by **_anti-narcotics_** authorities near a mall, that he had somehow been compromised, either from intelligence received or through a means of detection he was unaware of.

47     From this standpoint, it would have been futile for him to ‘_stonewall_’ the CNB officers, who would have easily traced his then parked vehicle from its point of origin, using registration and surveillance resources installed at the border checkpoint he had used to enter Singapore. If CNB officers would have little trouble tracing his car, they would similarly have little difficulty finding the two bundles containing _methamphetamine_ under the carpeting floorboards once the vehicle had been positively identified as the one he had used.

48     Unlike the situation of trying to search for drugs and contraband in the dynamic setting of a causeway queue of vehicles, the officers would not at all be pressed for time, or have any constraint to conducting a thorough search of a parked vehicle flagged as one used by a trafficking suspect. Mr Murugarajan, with the lived-in experiences of a 41-year, would have realised the **_futility_** of continued resistance, and extended the measure of co-operation seen. This ‘co-operation’ seemed, rather, born from the realisation by a mature person, that metaphorically speaking; “_the game was up_”, with nothing actually done that was especially effusive, spontaneous, or extraordinary as to suggest genuine remorse on Mr Murugarajan’s part.

### The plea of guilt also carries little mitigatory weight

49     In the presented situation, Mr Murugarajan’s decision to co-operate and indeed subsequently tender a plea of guilt must necessarily have limited value. In _Wong Kai Chuen Phillip_ v _Public Prosecutor_ \[1990\] 2 SLR (R) 61; <span class="citation">\[1990\] SGHC 79</span> (“_Phillip Wong_”), Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was), had warned against according undue weight in mitigation pleas to instances where ostensible co-operation with authorities was cited as evidence of remorse, but where the accused, in reality, had no other feasible option. The offender in _Phillip Wong_ was a solicitor who had criminally misappropriated some $1.84 million from the client’s account of his firm. At \[13\], Chan J observed:

> 13    Although the appellant surrendered himself to the CAD, it is significant to note that this event occurred at a time when **_he really had no other choice._** He had no choice because the Council of the Law Society had taken over the clients’ account of his firm and it was only a question of time before his misdeeds came to light… {Emphasis added\]

50     This degradation of the value of a guilty plea rendered in an absence of viable options has also been alluded to by the Chief Justice in _Vasentha_ where his Honour had held[^35]_:_

> It is well accepted that an admission of guilt that reflects genuine remorse is a mitigating factor. **_However, the courts have frequently given little weight to the offender’s plea of guilty in cases where the offender has been caught red-handed and has little choice but to plead guilty._** In most drug trafficking cases, given the presumptions in the MDA, an offender caught red-handed with the drugs in his possession will plead guilty. The courts have generally been reluctant in such cases to give significant mitigating weight to the plea of guilty…

> \[Emphasis added\]

51     In the same vein, co-operation with the authorities required a truly exceptional act such as the revelation of the offender’s **_upstream_** drug contacts or a willingness to testify against the co-accused. Mr Murugarajan is not known to have provided any useful actionable intelligence against the individuals who had supplied the _methamphetamine_. For the latter consideration, there was no demonstration of any assistance by the accused in the case against Mr Romzy (who had been charged with offences involving trafficking and possession of an assortment of drugs, and whose case is still pending at the time of rendition of these grounds). In _Vasentha_, Menon CJ had held:

> The courts have generally considered that the offender’s co-operation is not a strong mitigating factor where there is overwhelming evidence against the offender…As I have noted above, this applies with even greater force to drug trafficking cases in the light of the presumption. On the other hand, substantial mitigating weight may be given in cases where the offender extends his co-operation beyond his own confession. In _PP v Wong Jia Yi_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGDC 53</span> (“_Wong Jia Yi_”), the accused pleaded guilty to a drug trafficking charge. In deciding the appropriate sentence, the district judge took into account the fact that **_she “co-operated fully with the police, even to the extent of providing information as to her drug source”:_** W_ong Jia Yi_ at \[36\]. Similarly, the district judge in _Koh Bak Kiang_ at \[20\] gave substantial mitigating weight to the fact that the accused had co-operated with the authorities and was **_willing to be a witness for the Prosecution in the trial against his accomplic_**e.

### Continuing (but limited) relevance of youth as a mitigating factor in high volume trafficking and importation cases

52     As indicated in the foregoing, my impression was that the reduction in the term imposed in _Kogilan_ seemed predicated on the accused’s **_age_** and, more importantly, the fact that Mr Kogilan had carried out the trafficking in such a reckless and uncalculated manner that it was impossible not to draw an impression of him as a **_guileless_** and **_suggestible_** young man.

53     To recapitulate, Mr Kogilan had simply agreed to the perilous arrangement, having taken a box file, which he never checked for weight or contents, placed the same in his bag, and borne the items through the checkpoint by motorbike without apparent contemplation that the drugs he had not seen fit to examine might carry a considerable imprisonment term, or even breach the capital cut-off point. This was a combination which would, by case authority, have merited an assessment of diminished culpability, and consequently a downward adjustment in sentence to reflect this aspect.

54     In _Ikrimah_, Aedit Abdullah J expounded on the applicable principles when sentencing the offender, aged 23[^36] to a term of 26 years’ imprisonment. The offender there had admitted to (_inter alia_) importing “_not less than 249.99 g of methamphetamine_” The Court of Appeal in _Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 557</span> (“_Kalangie_”) had established[^37] an indicative three band sentencing range where if the _methamphetamine_ imported fell between the third band of 217.00g to 250.00g, the starting indicative sentence of between 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes was proposed.

55     The Court of Appeal in _Kalangie_ had applied a two-stage framework which was adapted from that established in _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span> (“_Suventher_”) for _methamphetamine_ importation, where the latter case had involved the importation of _cannabis_. The first stage involved identifying the indicative starting point based on the quantity of drugs, as the quantity is directly related to the harm to society and consequently the gravity of the offence. The second stage involves adjusting the indicative starting sentence upwards or downwards to consider the offender’s culpability, and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. These factors mirrored those set out in _Vasentha_,[^38] which involved a charge of trafficking in _diamorphine_. Justice Abdullah accordingly noted that “_The corresponding starting sentence_ (for the offender in _Ikrimah_) _should be 29 years as 249.99g is at the highest end of that spectrum_.”[^39]

56     For _Ikrimah’s_ case, a sentence of **_26 years’_** imprisonment and caning was finally imposed, with the global sentence aggregated to 27 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Mr Ikrimah’s youth was accorded a **_limited_** amount of consideration as one of the factors justifying a downward adjustment of the indicative sentence. This was evident from the offender’s sentence being adjusted leftwards to the lowest end of the band for 217g to 250g of _methamphetamine_ imported, which ranged from 26-29 years’ imprisonment, and where the amount trafficked, at “_not less than 249.99g_” was as at the tip of the highest end of the band, falling just short of the level for capital punishment, and attracting a prescribed maximum term of 30 years’ imprisonment with caning.

57     In rebuffing defence counsel’s initial call for a sentence of **_22 years’_** imprisonment[^40] with caning, Aedit Abdullah J elucidated on the need to strike a balance in the sentencing of young offenders who had committed extremely grave offences, such as in the trafficking or importation of high quantities of controlled drugs[^41], with considerations of rehabilitation and reform playing a less pronounced role against the prevalent need to send stronger deterrent and retributive messages against the purveyors of illicit narcotics :

> In my view, the fact that the Accused was young when arrested, or that he was a new courier, could not be of much mitigation value in light of the huge quantity of drugs imported**_. Youth lessens culpability most when the offence was committed impulsively or because of lack of maturity_**; shoplifting from a dare, or because of a desire to fit in, or a desire to obtain the latest fashion accessory, are prime examples of situations where **_immaturity may attract some reduction of sentence_**. There, the hope is that the offence will not be repeated as the offender becomes older. In such situations, youth may attract hope for rehabilitation and reform. **_However, such concerns play a smaller role where the offence in question is more serious and involves greater criminality._** The importation of drugs is such an offence. The severe consequences are well known; the harm resulting from such acts is pernicious and affects society as a whole.

58     Other aspects of _Ikrimah’s_ case were broadly similar with Mr Murugarajan’s situation, with an absence of antecedents in both instances. Both has also pleaded guilty and appeared to be couriers, who worked for fairly small sums; being $1500 for Mr Ikrimah and RM 1600 for the instant accused. The High Court did note the “_amateurish_”[^42] manner of Mr Ikrimah’s unsuccessful attempt to hide the drugs in his car boot, although this was not specifically tied to his youth.

59     Another case demonstrating this nuanced approach to sentencing relatively young offenders found trafficking a large quantity of drugs would be that of _Public Prosecutor v Pham Duyen Quyen_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_Pham HC_”) who was first sentenced in the High Court, with the sentence affirmed in the Court of Appeal in _Pham Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor_ \[2017\] 2 SLR 591 (“_Pham CA_”) to argue that youth is a mitigating factor. Aedit Abdullah J referenced this case in _Ikrimah_, stating that[^43]:

> 44    …The High Court _(in Pham HC)_ had considered that the accused was 24 at the time of hearing (at \[1\]), **_which was rather young, and treated it as a mitigating factor (at \[58\]). This was noted but not reversed_** in _Pham CA_ (at \[58\]).

> …

> 46    This was noted in _Pham HC_ itself, relied on by the Defence. There, the High Court stated at \[58\]:

>> In my decision on sentence, **_I took into account the mitigating factors, principally that she was a first offender_** **_and rather young_**. However, I could not ignore the fact that a large quantity of Methamphetamine was involved, even though the charge had been reduced to a non-capital offence. It was necessary for the sentence to reflect this large quantity, and also to reflect the sentences that have been imposed in similar cases.

>> \[Emphasis added\]

60     Justice Abdullah then observed that Lee Sieu Kin J in _Pham HC_ had duly noted the youth of the offender, and considerations of her as a youthful offender weighed against the huge amount of drugs imported, and consequently that “_a heavier sentence was necessary to reflect the large quantity_.”[^44] The offender _Pham Duyen Quyen_ (“Ms Pham”), who had been charged under section 7 of the MDA for importation of “_not less than 249.99g_” of methamphetamine, received a sentence of **_24 years’ imprisonment_**. In that case, she had been convicted after a nine-day trial[^45].

### Differentiating the cases of Pham HC, Ikrimah and Kogilan with the instant case

61     What is of especial relevance to instant case would be that the principal mitigating factor in _Pham HC/Pham CA_ and _Ikrimah_ was the relative youth of the offender, even where the amounts of methamphetamine imported in both instances were at “not less than 249.99g” would have pegged their sentences at the highest end of the _Kalangie_ spectrum of 29 years’ imprisonment. The fact that Ms Pham, aged 24, received a sentence of 24 years’ imprisonment, and Mr _Ikrimah_, aged 23 received 26 years; imprisonment attests from this notional starting point of 29 years’ imprisonment, to the continued, albeit limited, relevance of considering the youth, and concomitantly the immaturity of the offender in the downscaling of culpability, even as the potential harm of the huge quantities of drugs they carried remain high.

62     To allow a better contextual understanding of the significant sentencing discount in _Pham HC_, I should add that the factual background set out in Lee Sieu Kin J’s decision in Pham HC pointed to her as being extremely **_immature_**, to the extent of her having, just nine months before her arrest for the _methamphetamine_ importation offence, held idiosyncratic beliefs about the ‘_end of the world_’ occurring on a specific date[^46]. This was a point that had no bearing on her defence and hence she would have had no motive to fabricate such a detail.

> ‘On 19 December 2012, Pham travelled to New Delhi, India for the first time. **_She had seen on the Internet articles stating that the world was going to end_** on 21 December 2012 and she wanted to visit India before this.’

> \[Emphasis added\]

63     Mr Ikrimah, who received a heavier sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment with caning (amounting to a discount of three years from the indicative 29-year indicative sentence), was, as gleaned from the factual matrix rather more mature, despite being a year younger. At age 23, he was married and able to drive a car. While Mr Ikrimah was more infused into the drug trade, his candour and co-operation were notable, and he had assisted investigations to uncover drugs which were secreted elsewhere from the scene of arrest.

64     The more cogent comparison is of course _Kogilan_ where after the necessary adjustments to take into account the differing relative weight for the sentencing categories between _diamorphine_ there and _methamphetamine_ in the instant case, the indicative point of 15 years’ imprisonment was the **_common_** starting point for the first stage analysis. Mr Kogilan, as described earlier, displayed _naivete_ and an appetite for risk which was congruent to an impression that he was highly immature individual, who had not thought to even make a bid to examine his illicit consignment.

65     From the foregoing, I would hold the view that the ages of the Ms Pham, Mr Ikrimah and Mr Kogilan, who were respectively aged 24, 23 and 21 at the time of their offences, as well as certain aspects suggesting their lack of maturity, to have a significantly diminished their **_culpability_**. This was quite **_explicitly_** expressed in the High Court decisions of _Ikrimah_ and _PhamHC_, and **_implicitly_** so from my extrapolation of the known circumstances in the unreported decision of _Kogilan_. This aspect would not apply to reduce the culpability of Mr Murugarajan, who at 41 years, was two decades older than Mr Kogilan, at the time of his arrest.

### There are no merits in this case which would justify the accused being allowed any further significant discount from sentence

66     I could not agree with counsel’s sentencing position that the accused be sentenced to no more than 13 years and six months imprisonment (with caning). This would be impermissibly low. My analysis would begin with a consideration of the full perspective, starting with the fact that Mr Murugarajan had already been sentenced under a **_reduced_** charge, being factually found with quantity of drugs which would have placed him in a category that provided a mandatory **_minimum_** sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment (with caning).

67     I am, of course, mindful that the Court of Appeal in _Suventher_ has indicated that a sentencing court should not regard the Public Prosecutor’s decision to amend the charge to a lesser one as justifying a **_higher_** sentence in itself[^47]. The injunction against creating a higher starting point is a recognition that the bands in the framework should serve as a universal reference point for sentencing. These were intended to replace the need to plot specific sentencing points derived from the **_actual_** quantity trafficked in a particular case, with a notional increment in such a case if the quantity were actually higher. This proscribed approach would entail ‘_tacking_’ on additional terms of imprisonment if the quantum of drugs were factually **_higher_** (e.g “_168.44g_”) on toxicological analysis than the amount stipulated on the charge (e.g.”_166.99g_”), to allow a sentence lower than the mandatory minimum sentence for the bracket above (e.g. 20 years’ imprisonment with caning for “_not less than 167g_”). Hence it would not be appropriate for me to consider a sentence higher than the 15-year imprisonment term stipulated within the band **_solely_** on account of the higher actual quantity of drugs involved in a case.

68     I am suggesting that the **_corollary_** must also be true, which is that the court should be **_especially_** meticulous and cautious in sentencing to scrupulously avoid giving **_unmerited_** discounts in such cases, where the offender has already been conferred such an advantage. It is clear that _Ikrumah_ and _PhamHC_ stand as clear authorities that after establishing the indicative ‘starting-point’, reductions to sentences at the second stage are well justified where lowered culpability is assessed on account of an accused person’s **youth** and associated impulsivity or _naivete_. It would, nevertheless, be incumbent on the court to guard against an unwarranted extension of such reductions, especially where the case involves an utterly unremarkable factual matrix, where the offender is effectively a man in his early middle age, who would have been expected to have been capable of calculating the risks-against-benefits of his enterprise known better.

69     Counsel has, from a study of his submissions, attempted to persuade that a sentence for 41-year-old Mr Murugarajan comparable to that meted to the 21-year-old accused in _Kogilan_ was _apropos_. The question of age disparity aside, I could not agree with this proposition in a situation where practically all other aspects of their roughly similar _modus operandi_ did not really place Mr Murugrajan in any position where any major concessions on sentence which were warranted in _Kogilan_, would have been justified in the instant case as well.

### Whether financial gain is a factor in sentencing for trafficking cases

70     I will start with the question of the significance of Mr Murugarajan’s pecuniary motive in sentencing. Here, the DPP had the highlighted the accused’s financial motivation in trafficking in the _methamphetamine_ bundles to receive payment of RM1600 for the delivery and identified as an basis for an uplift.[^48] Learned counsel had conversely downplayed the rather paltry sum received in the instant case to be insignificant to sentencing, citing _Kalangie_ and _Ikrimah_ to state that that “_most drug traffickers or importers have been motivated by some form of financial or material gain and that the presence of such motivation did not render the offence materially more serious or the offender more culpable than any other case of drug trafficking or importation_.”[^49] As financial gain was a near-universal feature, the defence case was that there ought have been a truly exceptional aspect to the financial arrangement to justify an uplift.

71     The learned DPP pointed out that counsel had cited authorities from drug **_importation_** cases, whereas Mr Murugarajan had been charged with **_trafficking_**. I agreed with the DPP’s point, that while importation almost invariably involved a monetary transaction, trafficking could take many forms, with some permutations involving the supply of drugs without consideration, such as a drug user casually sharing drugs from his own ‘_stash_’ with his friends or associates. Trafficking in cases with a clear pecuniary motive suggested a more formalised, transactional activity involving co-ordination by multiple parties (and potentially including criminal syndicates), and hence might form a basis for elevated culpability.

72     Most crucially, Menon CJ had clearly specified “_Being_ **_motivated by financial_** _or other_ **_advantage_**_, whether operating as part of a drug syndicate or alone_” as a basis for enhanced **_culpability_** in _Vasentha_. In application of the foregoing to the instant case, I accept that _Vasentha_ sets out an unequivocal basis to elevate culpability. That being said, the level of uplift would be slight, given the modest sum that Mr Murugarajan was paid, as well as the fact that the prosecution was not asserting syndicate involvement.

### While the present case has parallels with Kogilan, the instant facts show greater premeditation and planning, and hence should be assessed with greater culpability

73     The parallels of the two cases are principally premised on the similar _modi operandi_ seen, where the two Malaysian traffickers played a role as couriers who also **_collected_** the payment for the drugs in Singapore. As DPP Hidayat Amir points out, this would have omitted any paper or electronic trial of the illicit supply of drugs that would have put authorities on alert that trans-border drug transactions were occurring. There were however critical differences, not least by the fact that Mr Murugarajan travelled by car and made a bid to conceal the _methamphetamine_ under a red carpet at the driver’s side floor of the vehicle. As alluded to above, the accused had handled the bundles and was fully cognisant of their nature and mass. Unlike Mr Kogilan, who was simply given a box file that he was not to open, Mr Murugarajan had some discretion as to how and where to conceal his illicit cargo.

### In contrast, Kogilan lacked autonomy and performed limited functions under direction

74     This conferment of discretion was a critical difference in assessing the level of planning and premeditation involved, since Mr Mururajan, with the freedom of action and use of a car, would be in a far better position to “_take active steps to avoid detection of the offence_”, which was a culpability enhancing criterion in _Vasentha_. The converse would be true in _Kogilan_, where the offender had a distinct lack of such autonomy, and thus would be closer to “_performing only a limited function under direction_”, which is that of conveying a pre-packed box file to the intended recipient, and which was a factor ameliorating culpability per the criteria articulated in _Vasentha._ This was, of course, over and above permissible reductions in culpability on account of Mr Kogilan’s youth and associated higher probability that he had “_become involved through naivety”_ which is yet another culpability reducing factor.

75     It was plain to defence counsel that _Vasentha_, and subsequent cases setting out the equivalency translations for _methamphetamine_ against the _diamorphine_ involved in that case, had set out a plain baseline The indicative band should, for the typical _methamphetamine_ trafficker trafficking 166.99g be **_15 years’_** imprisonment with caning of **_11 strokes_**. While this is an indicative starting point, I would believe that adjustments ought be made only where truly cogent and defensible reasons, _per_ the criteria set out in the _Vasentha_, exist. This being necessary to lend a level of constancy and rigour to the sentencing process, and preserve the deterrent value of imposed sentences. Thus, where a case is entirely **_typica_**_l_ or **_unremarkable_**, a run through of _indicia_ for shifting culpability and aggravating/mitigating factors ought not, metaphorically speaking, cause any significant ‘_shifting of the needle_’.

76     In my judgment, Mr Mururarajan’s case must be considered such an unremarkably ‘_average_’ trafficking case. While there are no powerful reasons for elevating culpability or factors **_gravely_** aggravating the offence ( quite aside from the more marginal bases expressed above) from the indicative first look sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment, the case has also been particularly sparse in mitigating. Counsel had sought a **_sharply reduced_** sentence of 13 years and six months imprisonment with ten strokes of the cane.

### Cherry-picking similarities between Kogilan and the instant case, while ignoring essential differences, to ask for a similar sentence, would lead to undue leniency

77     As seen from the discussion, the defence had sought to ‘_shoehorn_’ the factual matrix of _Kogilan_ to the present case to advocate a similar sentence based principally on superficial similarities in their mode of collecting cash proceeds while undertaking the process of trafficking. As discussed above, this mode, in itself, would have **_added_** a measure of **_culpability_** to the activity as it effectively removed a potentially incriminating step for the principals to separately collect payment, an activity which could have generated paper or other communication trails which could have exposed these upstream individuals, entities or syndicates, to discovery of their illicit activity. This modality of simultaneous delivery and collection would thus have allowed a level of deniability and subterfuge that was beneficial to these principals.

78     Counsel’s selective exercise of militating for the same sentence as _Kogilan_ because of one perceived parallel would amount to a ‘_cherry-picking_’ of perceived similarities beneficial to his narrative, while ignoring or minimizing obvious differences. As mentioned, Mr Murugarajan was almost **_twice_** as old as Mr Kogilan, and exercised considerably more planning and pre-meditation. The accused’s **_maturity_** was quite evident from his eloquent and earnest and eloquently worded personal mitigation plea[^50] which was rendered in skilled penmanship with a level of stroke fluency that suggested a strong command of the English language, and a facility for written business and personal communications.

79     Mr Murugarajan referenced the personal hardship that would be visited on his family, and expressed contrition where he “_sincerely apologise_(d) _for all_ (his) _ill actions_”. For the former point made, the case of _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span>, has made it plain that the notion of financial and other hardships being visited on an offender’s family from his lawful punishment would, absent exceptional circumstances, not constitute any mitigatory ground. For the latter, the earlier discussion will show that Mr Murugarajan had not demonstrated any timely or effective remorse or anything which would translated to actions that were substantively helpful to the investigations, or in bringing Mr Murugarajan’s co-offenders, or for that matter, his principals, to book.

80     There is thus no basis to assess any equivalency for sentence between _Kogilan_ and the instant case. The perceived parallels in their manner of trafficking are too superficial and inconsequential to militate for a similar sentence, where Mr Murugarajan ought from a juxtaposition of the respective factual matrices be accorded with significantly greater culpability, and a moderate increment from the aggravating factors mentioned in the foregoing.

81     As covered in the forgoing, the fundamental operating principles have been set out in _Vasentha_ and other cases authorities. This being that while adjustments may be justified to address the individual circumstances of each case, the quantity of drugs trafficked is still the most important determinant in sentencing, this is so because the amount trafficked is closely corelated to the potential **_harm_** that the drugs would cause. The authorities have clearly stipulated that, absent truly exceptional circumstances, there should not be any substantial deviation from the quantum-based starting point. These cases have also indicated that it would not be inappropriate to mete the starting-point indicative sentence, where there are no good reasons to justify an adjustment.

82     In the instant case, this indicative starting point has been unequivocally established to be 15 years imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane. Blindly allowing a decrement of one year and six months from the sentence because of perceived parallels with _Kogilan_ would be contrary to the case authorities and have led to Mr Murugarajan, a 41-year-old offender, who was allowed free reign to plan on where he would hide his drugs, and who only co-operated when he had no real options, receiving the same sentence as a naïve 21-year-old who was demonstrably risk-blind while acting on directions when he undertook his nefarious mission to traffick in controlled drugs.

83     Given the clear guidelines enunciated in _Vasentha_, a sentencing court must do its duty in exercising care and discernment in handling high quantity drug trafficking cases. According undue leniency in undeserving cases would lead, over time, to a derogation of the quantity-based indicative benchmarks, and concomitantly, an erosion of their effectiveness as deterrents in promoting certainty of terms of punishment.

84     I should add, for completeness, that the accused in _Kogilan_ had admitted to having made prior deliveries using the same _modus operandi_ before he was arrested in respect of the act of trafficking upon which the proceeded charge was premised, and this was reflected in the Statement of Facts there, while Mr Murugarajan’s Statement of Facts has been silent on this regard. I do not propose to read too much into this aspect, as these deliveries had not been framed as TIC charges, and the nature and quantity of drugs (if indeed the deliveries involved drugs) was indeterminate, as Mr Kogilan had never opened the box file on those occasions as well to examine what he was conveying. Indeed these details seem, from the context, to be **_self-reported_** by Mr Kogilan to the investigating officer. (Mr Yap, the co-accused was, from the related facts, demonstrably non-cooperative) There is nothing to suggest any adjustment to the sentence imposed as a result of these facts, and any notion of higher culpability from this disclosure should be counterbalanced by the fact that Mr Kogilan’s volunteering of inculpatory information showed him to be a forthright and candid offender, who was ostensibly keen to express remorse for his actions.

85     Ultimately I recognised that there ought be some value placed on Mr Murugarajan’s relatively early plea of guilt, as well as his lack of antecedents. While I was mindful of the reasons prosecution’s submissions for an uplift of three months, I noted the modest sum that Mr Murugarajah had sought, and that he had been motivated by desperate financial straits rather than greed in an absence of want. In addition, while there had been an attempt at concealment, this had not taken the elaborate form such as that in cases like _Kalangie_ (who had secreted pellets of _methamphetamine_ within his own body by ingestion and suppository-style insertion). I was thus persuaded that the countervailing culpability considerations, aggravating/mitigating features, and offender specific factors would justify an adjustment **_below_** the indicative stating point of 15 years; imprisonment and 11 strokes of the cane for the trafficking of 166.99g of _methamphetamine_.

### Decision on Sentence

86     Accordingly, the following sentence was imposed:

87     Mr Murugarajan’s sentence was backdated to the date of his arrest, which was 11 February 2020.

88     All considered, I do believe that the foregoing will show the imposed sentence to be a condign punishment, which was observant of applicable precedents, addressing the stark need for effective deterrence for the offence of drug trafficking, but also a sentence that concomitantly would not be regarded as either crushing, or one that was unresponsive to, or inconsonant with Mr Murugarajan’s rehabilitative prospects.

### Present status of accused person
