\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9022/2019/01 \]

22 April 2019

### District Judge Kenneth Yap:

The accused, a taxi driver, pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 324 of the Penal Code for voluntary causing hurt to another taxi driver by means of fire. The offending act was somewhat novel, the accused having sprayed a can of insecticide three times at the face of another taxi driver at a busy intersection. On the third occasion, the accused used a lighter to ignite the aerosol spray, causing a flash fire which resulted in first degree burns to the head of the victim. The accused was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment and 18 months’ disqualification from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences. I deferred the sentence so that the accused could begin service after the Chinese New Year period. He subsequently filed an appeal against sentence, and was granted bail pending appeal.

### The Charge

2       The charge under s 324 is reproduced for convenient reference:

You … are charged that you, on the 1st day of May 2017, at or about 8.00pm, at the traffic light junction of Harbourfront Walk and Telok Blangah Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to Lam Choon Chai by means of fire, to wit, by spraying insecticide at Lam Choon Chai, and igniting the aerosol stream with a lighter, causing the victim to suffer first degree superficial burns to the left ear, cheek and neck, and singeing of the left head hair and left eyebrow, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

3       The offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment, fine, caning, in any combination of such punishments. Under s 42(2) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276), the offender convicted under this provision can, in addition to the punishment imposed, be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or such period as the court may think fit.

### Statement of Facts

4       The accused is a male Chinese taxi driver, aged 66 years.

5       The victim is one Mr Lam Choon Chai, a male Chinese aged 61 years. He was also a taxi driver, under the employ of a different company.

6       On 1 May 2017, at about 8.00 pm, while the victim was waiting in line in his taxi at the Vivocity taxi stand to pick up passengers, the accused abruptly cut into his lane. This almost caused the victim’s taxi to collide into the wall. The victim did not confront the accused at this point, and both proceeded to pick up passengers from the taxi stand. Both parties then drove towards the traffic light junction of Harbourfront Walk and Telok Blangah Road.

7       When the taxis came to a complete stop at the red light junction, the victim wound down his front left passenger window and started hurling vulgarities at the accused over the earlier incident, which involved some colourful Hokkien epithets denigrating the latter’s mother.

8       In response, the accused alighted from his taxi, taking a can of insecticide from his taxi with him. The accused then stretched his hand into the victim’s taxi through the open front left passenger window, pointed the can of insecticide at the victim, and sprayed the insecticide twice at the victim from a distance of about 30 cm from the face of the victim. During the second spray, some of the insecticide entered the victim’s eyes, causing him irritation and pain. The victim’s passenger, witnessing the incident, shouted at the accused.

9       After the second spray, the accused returned to his taxi. He retrieved a lighter from his taxi, returned to the victim’s taxi, and sprayed the insecticide at the victim a third time. This time, the accused placed the lighter in front of the insecticide spray can, lit it, and ignited the aerosol stream, creating a flash fire. The flash fire lasted for about three seconds.

10     As a result of the flash fire, the victim called for police assistance. He was later conveyed to the hospital by ambulance, and was diagnosed to have suffered from first degree superficial burns to the left ear, cheek and neck, and singeing of the left head hair and left eyebrow as a result of the flash fire.

11     The can of insecticide, which was seized for investigations, had indications on its packaging that its contents were flammable and that contact with the skin, eyes and clothing should be avoided.

12     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed an offence under s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

### Antecedents

13     The accused is untraced.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

14     The prosecution sought a sentence of at least fourteen months’ imprisonment, as well as a disqualification order, the duration of which was left to the court.

15     As a starting point, the prosecution took the position that this was a case involving medium culpability and low harm within the context of a harm-culpability sentencing matrix. The learned prosecutor made general reference to the following five-step methodology laid out by Sundaresh Menon CJ in respect of applying a sentencing matrix in the High Court decision of _Logachev Vladislav v PP_ at \[76\]-\[84\]:

(i)     Identifying the level of harm caused by the offence, and the level of the offender’s culpability;

(ii)     Identifying the applicable indicative sentencing range within the matrix;

(iii)     Identifying the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range, with reference to the factors in (i);

(iv)     Adjusting the starting point to take into account offender-specific factors; and

(v)     Making further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

16     The prosecution also highlighted that the sentencing range laid out in the second step should generally utilise the full spectrum of possible sentences that can be imposed for the offence, in order to reflect the gravity with which Parliament views that particular offence (per _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ (“Vasentha”) at \[46\], and _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ \[2014\] SLR 892 at \[60\]).

17     The prosecution then posited that the accused should be considered as having medium culpability under the first step for the following reasons:

(a)     The accused’s act was vastly disproportionate to any provocation issued by the victim;

(b)     The accused committed the acts despite there being a passenger in the car who had shouted at the accused;

(c)     There was an element of premeditation as the accused returned back to his car to procure the lighter;

(d)     The offence took place at a traffic light junction, while the signal was red.

18     In the prosecution’s view, the offence was considered one involving low harm as the burns on the victim were superficial, although the potential for serious harm was high.

19     The prosecution then proposed the following sentencing matrix, which set the appropriate starting range for a low-medium finding on the harm-culpability matrix at at least one year’s imprisonment:

20     The prosecution added that as this was a case of road rage, there was a strong need for deterrence, and that the sentence would accordingly have to be higher than the indicative minimum start point of 12 months.

21     By way of comparison, the prosecution highlighted that in the case of _PP v Rahim bin Hasan_ (DAC 944995/2017), the accused was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment for a charge of mischief by fire under s 435 of the Penal Code for throwing a Molotov cocktail. The s 435 offence carries the same maximum term of imprisonment as the present s 324 offence. It was noted that no injuries were suffered in _Rahim bin Hasan_, unlike in the present case, although in _Rahim_’s case the offender was traced for two counts of voluntarily causing hurt. Given the overriding need for deterrence in a road rage case, the prosecution maintained that a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment was warranted.

22     Finally, the prosecution also sought a compensation order to be made in relation to the medical costs incurred by the victim.

### Mitigation Plea

23     Counsel for the defence highlighted that the accused had undergone an acrimonious divorce in 2005 which resulted in him losing his family. He had also lost his former job as an area manager for Ericsson due to the divorce. The accused had been driving a limousine service taxi for approximately seven years. Since the incident, the accused had effectively lost his livelihood and is no longer driving for the limousine service.

24     The accused is also diagnosed with high blood pressure and suffering from stress anxiety. The ongoing investigations and court proceedings had taken a serious toll on his health, and he had suffered a coronary attack for which he was warded for an emergency operation. He had also received psychiatric treatment as he was experiencing severe mental anxiety and stress.

25     With regard to the incident, the accused claimed that the assault only occurred after numerous occasions of altercation, verbal insults and gesturing between the parties. It was explained that the accused had taken the aerosol can and lighter out of the car because he was fearful of any physical contact with the victim.

26     Counsel for the defence highlighted that the accused was an upright citizen with an unblemished record. The violence displayed on the day in question was a one-off incident and completely out of character. The accused expressed his deep regret and apologised to the victim, and was ready and willing to compensate him for medical expenses. The defence also pointed out that the accused had been forthright and candid in the process of investigations, and had chosen to plead guilty rather than waste the court’s resources. Accordingly, the defence sought for compassion to be demonstrated in this case and that a minimal sentence be imposed.

### The Sentence

27     The sentencing objective in this case, involving as it did an act of extreme and vicious road rage, must surely be one of general deterrence.

28     The key plank of the prosecution’s submissions is that the starting sentencing range for an offence on the low-medium confluence of the harm-culpability matrix should be upwards of one year’s imprisonment. Given that the maximum sentence for a s 324 offence is up to seven years’ imprisonment, I did not find this to be excessive. Under the prosecution’s proposed table, the highest sentencing range, which would apply to an offence of high culpability and serious harm, would be upwards of 4.5 years’ imprisonment. That provides sufficient headroom for an uplift for extremely egregious cases, while suitability utilising the full spectrum of the sentencing range (per _Vasentha_). Accordingly, I was in broad agreement with the prosecution’s sentencing table for s 324.

29     I was also in full agreement with the prosecution that the offender’s culpability should be considered at the medium level, and that the harm caused was low. Turning first to the extent of harm, I noted that the extent of injuries suffered by the victim were fairly minor. According to the medical report, his left head hair and left eyebrow were singed, and there were first degree burns around the left ear, cheek and neck, with no blisters. The victim was discharged after the medical examination, and incurred medical expenses of $115. All this suggested that while the element of fear and alarm was high, the injuries suffered by the victim were minimal, which supported a finding that the case be considered one of low harm.

30     I turn next to culpability. The use of fire in an act of assault elevates the severity of the offence, given the potential for uncontrollable consequences. This is especially so when a flash fire is ignited within a vehicle with two passengers seated within, in the middle of a busy road intersection with other road users in the vicinity. Had the flash fire in turn ignited a larger conflagration, the consequences could have been unthinkable. Further, while I note that the incident was triggered by the victim’s verbal provocation and was not premeditated, the accused’s act of spraying the aerosol can three times, with the final assault being preceded by his return to his car to obtain a lighter, demonstrates extreme recklessness and blatant disregard for the danger posed to human life. In that regard, there can be no credence to the claim that the accused had felt that he was under physical threat or had been acting in self defence. The victim had never exited his vehicle, and if the accused could return to his taxi to obtain the lighter, he could have easily retreated to the safety of his vehicle and driven away. To my mind, there was no doubt that the accused’s actions must clearly bring him within the range of medium culpability, given that fire was employed for the purposes of an assault under such dangerous circumstances.

31     The fact that the assault was an act of road rage further justifies an uplift from the minimum starting point of one year’s imprisonment. The litmus test for whether the deterrent sentencing policy associated with road rage offences should apply is whether the facts disclose that the violence perpetuated by a road user was as a result of real of perceived slights arising from other road users, stemming from differences that arise in the shared use of our roads, per _Public Prosecutor v Lim Yee Hua and Anor_ , at \[21\] and \[25\]. In this case, the genesis of the altercation was the manner in which the accused had cut into the victim’s path earlier at the VivoCity taxi stand. There can be no doubt that this was a quintessential road rage offence. An uplift to within the middle part of the range of one to two years’ imprisonment would have been justified as an expression of the deterrent stance taken by the courts against such behaviour.

32     A perusal of the authorities provided by the prosecution would also show that a sentence of imprisonment between the range of one to two years would not be excessive. At the outset, I would note that the offences involving the application of heat, but which carry no risk of a conflagration by fire, belonged to a relatively lower degree of culpability. Accordingly, in cases involving assault by way of splashing of a mug of hot fishball noodle soup (_PP v Kho Ah Yeow_, DAC 941530/2015, where the offender was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment), the pouring of hot water (_PP v AEV_, MA 384/2009, for which the offender was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment on appeal), the pressing of a lit cigarette against the face (_PP v Law Shijie_, DAC 927939/2014 & Ors, where the offender was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment), or the use of a lighter to burn the skin (_PP v Peter Elangovan s/o Adaikkalasamy v PP_, MA 312/2009, where the offender was sentenced to 11 months’ imprisonment), the sentences imposed would understandably be of lesser than one year’s imprisonment.

33     Quite conversely, where the assault involved a serious risk of a conflagration, the sentence under s 324 would be significantly higher. In _PP v Tan Choon Song_ (DAC 11795/1994), the offender threw a packet of ignited petrol at the victim’s head, which the victim managed to block with his arm, but which led to his clothing catching fire. The victim suffered partial thickness burns on his forearm, right flank and both his thighs as a result. Some of the burns required excision and split skin grafting. The offender in that case was sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. This would likely be uplifted further if the offence was repeated in the present day, as the maximum imprisonment term under s 324 at the material time was five years, as compared to seven years at present. Granted, the throwing of a petrol bomb presents a much higher risk of conflagration than the present case involving the ignition of an aerosol spray. The appropriate penalty in the present case must therefore lie in between those cases that involved only the application of heat or a controlled flame in the assault, and those which involved the use of ignitable solid fuel. This reinforced my view that a sentence somewhere along the mid point of the sentencing range of one to two years would have been fair in this case.

34     I turn next to offender-specific considerations. I take note that the accused was contrite, had cooperated with the authorities, and had pleaded guilty. He is also a first offender. However, I found that there was somewhat limited value to the plea of guilt as the evidence against the accused was largely uncontroverted (per _Chia Kah Boon v PP_ at \[12\]), given the clear injuries suffered by the victim and the observation of the incident by his passenger. Nevertheless, I considered that the accused’s plea of guilt still saved time and resources that would otherwise have been incurred at trial. Taking this into account, this mitigating factor would bring the appropriate sentence to the lower end of the sentencing range of one to two years’ imprisonment.

35     As for the accused’s personal circumstances and health condition, I did not find them so exceptional that they constituted a mitigating factor. The learned prosecutor had confirmed that the accused’s heart condition could be adequately addressed by the prisons service. In addition, having applied my mind to the totality principle, I likewise did not find the sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment to be crushing to an offender of the accused’s age and condition.

36     For the above reasons, I found that the sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment requested by the prosecution was amply justified and so imposed this sentence on the accused.

37     With regard to the issue of disqualification, I was satisfied that the commission of the offence “arose from or was connected with a dispute between the offender and that other person over the use of the road or public place”, within the meaning of s 42(2)(c) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276). Under s 42(2), the court is granted a broad power to disqualify an offender from driving for life or for such period as the court depends fit. In exercising the discretion granted by this provision to disqualify an offender from driving, the court should “bear in mind the need for deterrence of unruly or violent behaviour as well as the need to protect other road users.” (per Tay Yong Kwang JA in _PP v Fizul Asrul bin Efandi_ at \[13\]). Mindful of the brazen nature and potential harm that could have been caused by the act of igniting a flash fire, the alarm such an act would have caused to other road users, and the need to protect other road users from any further aberrant behaviour by the accused, I found that a disqualification of 18 months from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences was appropriate.

38     Finally, I acceded to the prosecution’s request to order compensation in the sum of $115 to be paid by the accused to the victim, pursuant to s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

39     The accused’s sentence was deferred to 19 February 2019. He filed his appeal in the interim, and was granted a stay of execution on the order of imprisonment and disqualification on 14 February 2019, with bail pending appeal fixed at $8,000. He is presently released on bail pending appeal.
