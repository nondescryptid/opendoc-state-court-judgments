\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9217/2022/01.\]

17 November 2022

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The accused, Mr Shermen Button, a 33-year-old male Singapore citizen had pleaded guilty to the following charges:

1st Charge

> are charged that on 3 December 2021 at or about 3.49 a.m., along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 towards Upper Thomson Road after Central Expressway, near lamppost 142, Singapore, did drive a motorcar bearing registration number SJX170Y, when you were under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles, to wit, you had been disqualified by a Judge of the State Court, Singapore, from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months with effect from 11 May 2021 to 10 May 2022 and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 43(4)(a) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276.

2nd charge

> are charged that on 3 December 2021 at or about 3.49 a.m., along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 towards Upper Thomson Road after Central Expressway, near lamppost 142, Singapore, being the driver of ride motorcar bearing registration number SJX170Y, whilst there was not in force in relation to the use of the said vehicle by you, such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third-party risks that complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed) and you have thereby contravened Section 3(1) of the Act which contravention is an offence that is punishable under Section 3(2) and Section 3(3) of the Act.

2       The accused was first charged in court for the present offences on 30 March 2022. The matter was subsequently adjourned for representations and further representations to be made by Defence Counsel as well as the replies by the Prosecution.

3       On 21 October 2022, the accused pleaded guilty to the two charges as set out above and admitted to the Statement of Facts without any qualification. The remaining charge for furnishing false information to a public servant in MAC 901976-2022 under s 177(1)(_a_) of the Penal Code was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. After considering the accused’s written plea in mitigation and the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence, I sentenced the accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="9.28%"><col width="31.46%"><col width="59.26%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S/No</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Charge No.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sentence</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 904484 of 2022</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eight weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 24 months with effect from date of release.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 904485 of 2022</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$1,000 in default five days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 24 months with effect from date of conviction.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total:</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eight weeks’ imprisonment and fine of $1,000 in default five days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 24 months with effect from date of release.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

4       The accused sought a deferment of the sentence until 31 October 2022 for him to settle his personal affairs. He was allowed to make payment of the fine on his surrender date _ie_ 31 October 2022.

5       The accused, being dissatisfied with my decision, had filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentence and order of disqualification on 31 October 2022. He is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. A stay of the payment of the fine as well as the disqualification order was ordered pending the hearing of his appeal.

6       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

7       The accused was the driver of motorcar bearing registration number SJX170Y, at the time of the incident. The vehicle belongs to the accused’s company and he is the sole proprietor of the company. The complainant is Sergeant Sheikh Abdul Muzzammil Bin Sheikh Abdul Feisal from the Traffic Police Department.

#### Facts of case

8       On 3 December 2021 at or about 3.49am, the accused was driving one motorcar, SJX170Y along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 towards Upper Thomson Road after Central Expressway, near lamppost 142, Singapore, when he was stopped for checks by the complainant. The complainant ascertained the driver to be that of the accused. Upon screening, it was found that the accused had driven the said motorcar while under disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles. The accused had been disqualified by a Judge of the State Court, Singapore, from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months with effect from 11 May 2021 to 10 May 2022.

9       As the accused was under disqualification from driving, there was no insurance policy or such a security in respect of Third-Party Risks that complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) in relation to the use of the said motorcar by the accused. The accused has also contravened s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed) and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3(2) read with s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation Act (Chapter 189, 2000 Rev Ed).

10     Further investigations revealed that on 3 December 2021, at about 2.30am, the accused went to retrieve the said motorcar from Golden Hill Estate, which was left behind by the last user, with the intention to drive back to his residence at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. While the accused was travelling along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 towards Upper Thomson Road after Central Expressway, he was stopped by the complainant.

#### Conclusion

11     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had committed the offences:

> (a)     Driving Whilst under Disqualification under s 43(4)(a) of the Road Traffic Act, Chapter 276; and

> (b)     Using Vehicle without Insurance Coverage under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act, Chapter 189.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

12     The prescribed penalty for a first offender under s 43(4)(_a_) of the Road Traffic Act (“RTA”) is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both. Pursuant to s 42(1) of the RTA, as the offence is in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, the Court shall order the offender from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court thinks fit.

13     The prescribed penalty for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risk and Compensation) Act (“MVA”) is fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both. S 3(3) of the MVA provides that a person convicted of an offence under this section shall be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the RTA for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction or to a longer period of disqualification unless there are special reasons not to make the order.

### Antecedents

14     On 8 October 2019, the accused was convicted in Court 21 for an offence of speeding under s 63(4) of the RTA. He was sentenced to a fine of $750 in default three days’ imprisonment.

15     On 11 May 2021, the accused was convicted in Court 7B for an offence of permitting another person to use a motor vehicle without the requisite insurance coverage under s 3(1) of the MVA. He was sentenced to a fine of $600 in default two days’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months with effect from 11 May 2021. He was also convicted for an offence permitting an underaged person to drive a motor vehicle under s 64(2) of the RTA. He was sentenced to a fine of $600 in default two days’ imprisonment.

16     The accused had also compounded two offences for failing to conform to red light signal under s 120(4) of the RTA on 16 November 2016 where he paid $200 and on 12 April 2019 where he paid $400.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

17     The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least eight weeks’ imprisonment with 24 months’ disqualification for the charge under s 43(4)(_a_) of the RTA as the accused was a first offender and the maximum fine $1,000 with 24 months’ disqualification for the charge under s 3(1) of the MVA as he had a relevant previous conviction.

### Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

18     In his written plea in mitigation, apart from providing the accused’s personal background, his Defence Counsel Mr Kalidass Murugaiyan had set out the circumstances leading to the present charges.

#### Circumstances leading to the offences

19     It was highlighted that the accused is the sole proprietor of Paradise of Cars, a business centred on car rentals. The vehicle bearing license plate number SJX170Y is one of the cars the business offers for rental. The car was initially parked in the vicinity of the accused’s friend’s residence. The accused had a customer who had arranged for the car to be rented in the morning of 3 December 2021. It was the usual practice for the accused to use his residential address as the pickup point for customers to collect and return the rented cars.

20     The Defence had submitted that the accused had driven the car as he as he was unable to find a driver willing to drive it to his residence on his behalf. As the customer was going to collect the car in the morning, he needed time to have the car ready for a handover in the morning. This was why he wanted to have the car back at his residence earlier.

#### Sentencing considerations

21     The Defence had acknowledged that while the sentencing precedents do not support the imposition of a fine, the Court was urged to consider a non-custodial term for the s 43(4)(_a_) of the RTA charge, a fine of up to S$600 for the insurance charge, and a global disqualification period of 12 months.

22     It was submitted that the starting point for a first offender for an offence of driving while under disqualification is an imprisonment term of four to eight weeks: _Fam Shey Yee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 927</span> at \[12\](“_Fam Shey Yee_”). It was further submitted that a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment and a 12-month disqualification were imposed in _Public Prosecutor v Soyed Foysal Ahamed Pavel_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 131</span>. The accused in that case was previously under a 6-month disqualification order.

23     It was highlighted that in _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Fathani Bin Khairuddin_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 143</span> (“_Abdul Fathani_”), a sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment and a 42-month disqualification order were imposed for a s 43(4)(a) charge as well as a S$600 fine and 12-month disqualification order were imposed for the insurance charge. It was highlighted that the Court had considered the fact that the accused in that case appeared to have no intention of giving up his driving license in spite of a court order and that the offence was committed about six months after the initial disqualification of 23 months for drink driving. It was the Defence’s position that from the sentencing precedents, it does appear that a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment is the norm.

24     The Defence had sought to distinguish the precedents above on the following basis:

> (a)     It did not appear that the accused drove for a long distance. This necessarily limits the potential risk to other road users

> (b)     The traffic at the material time would have been minimal. This further curtailed the potential risk to other road users when there were barely any to speak of.

> (c)     The incident occurred after more than half of the disqualification period had passed. It was not a situation of the accused having offended early into the disqualification.

> (d)     Save for this incident, the accused had duly complied with the disqualification notwithstanding his position as the owner of a car rental business. Due consideration should be accorded to how the accused adapted to the disqualification accordingly such that his clients would drive the rental cars to and from his residential address. It was submitted that the accused’s friends would on occasion help him drive the vehicles as well.

> (e)     The accused acted spontaneously. Had he made better plans, he would have the necessary arrangements to avoid even being in a scenario of having to rent out a car with no driver available to ferry it back to his residence beforehand. This would have been consistent with his business practice of relying on others for help precisely so that he could abide by the disqualification order.

25     In the present case, it was submitted that the traffic at the material time would have been minimal. Moreover, it was not a situation of the accused going for a joyride. Misguided as he was, the accused drove out of concern for his customer who was to take over the car in the morning. It was further submitted that there appeared to be no suggestion that the accused was driving in a dangerous manner.

#### Disqualification order

26     As regards the period of disqualification, it was submitted that the High Court in _Kwan Weiguang v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 121</span> had identified several factors relevant and material in the calibration of the disqualification period:

> (a)     The manner of driving, such as having exhibited poor control, reckless driving, excessive speeding, and rambunctious or intemperate behaviour: at \[65\].

> (b)     The risk and danger to road users, such as offending during heavy traffic and driving a heavy vehicle: at \[66\].

> (c)     The extent of harm and potential harm, considering the volume of traffic, number of pedestrians, speed and manner of driving, and type of vehicle: at \[67\].

> (d)     The competence of the offender and attitude towards other road users; where there is a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users and a lack of personal responsibility, it is within the public interest to remove such a driver from the roads for a substantial period of time: at \[68\].

> (e)     Past driving records may reveal whether an offender is an unsafe driver with a cavalier attitude towards road safety: at \[71\].

#### Conclusion

27     It was the Defence’s position that the accused had been demonstrably remorseful for his conduct. It was submitted that he had erred in a moment of folly, and all his efforts in abiding by the law was foiled by his mistake at the material time. It was further submitted that the accused was not a recalcitrant offender who is a menace to other road users. He has learned his lesson for good.

28     Given the foregoing, the Court was urged to consider a non-custodial term for the s 43(4)(_a_) of the RTA charge, a fine of up to S$600 for the insurance charge and a global disqualification period of 12 months. It was orally submitted that if the Court was of the view that a custodial term was to be imposed, in the alternative, a sentence of four to six weeks’ imprisonment can be considered.

#### Prosecution’s Reply

29     In response to the Defence’s address on sentence, it was submitted that the starting point for an offence of driving while under disqualification is eight weeks’ imprisonment. In _Public Prosecutor v Peng Jianwen_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 93</span> (“_Peng Jianwen_”), the High Court had affirmed that the starting point for such an offence is 8 weeks’ imprisonment. In the present case, the accused had only served half of the disqualification period. There was no reason to deviate from the usual starting point of eight weeks’ imprisonment.

## My decision on sentence

### Sentencing principles

#### s 43(4)(a) of the RTA

30     Driving while under a disqualification order is considered a serious road traffic offence. Yong Pung How CJ said in the case of _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) 581 at para \[43\]:

> Driving while under disqualification is about as serious an offence as a motorist can commit. Not only does it compromise the safety of our roads; it also creates problems in ensuring adequate compensation for luckless victims.

31     General and specific deterrence are the main sentencing consideration when dealing with offences under s 43(4) of the RTA (_PP v Lee Cheow Loong Charles_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 961</span> and _Muhammad Saiful bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1028</span> (“_Muhammad Saiful_”). Deterrence is an important principle that underlies our sentencing jurisprudence and it is directed at keeping crime rates in check (_PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[18\]). General deterrence aims to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of a particular offender (_Meeran bin Mydin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 1 SLR(R) 522</span> at \[9\]).

32     Prior to the 2019 amendments to the Road Traffic Act, the maximum prescribed punishment for both a first and repeat offender for an offence of driving while under disqualification under s 43(4) of the RTA was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both. Since the amendments to the RTA on 1 November 2019, the punishment for a repeat offender under s 43(4)(_b_) of the RTA has been enhanced to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding six years or to both, to provide stronger deterrence against re-offending. The present charge was committed after the 2019 amendment to the RTA.

33     From the sentencing precedents relied upon by both the Prosecution and the Defence, it is evident that the starting point for an offence of driving while under disqualification has been enhanced from four to eight weeks’ imprisonment in _Fam Shey Yee_ to a starting point of eight weeks’ imprisonment after the amendments to the RTA in both _Abdul Fathani_ and _Peng Jianwen_.

34     Driving whilst under a disqualification order is a strict liability offence. This was held by the High Court in _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) 581 (“_Chng Wei Meng_”) at \[19\] and affirmed in _Muhammad Saiful_ at \[23\]). As such, the mere act of driving under a disqualification order is all that had to be proven for the offence to be made out: See \[23\] of _Muhammad Saiful_. In that case, Sundaresh Menon CJ had considered some specific types of mitigating and aggravating factors namely:

> (a)     Knowledge of the disqualification order;

> (b)     Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law;

> (c)     Length of time from expiry of the original disqualification order;

> (d)     Weight of surrounding circumstances.

#### Knowledge of disqualification order

35     In the present case, the accused was convicted on 11 May 2021 in Court 7B for an offence of permitting another person to use a motor vehicle without the requisite insurance coverage under s 3(1) of the MVA. He was sentenced to a $600 fine and a 12 months’ disqualification and this sentence has not been set aside as no appeal was filed against this sentence. Hence, the accused was clearly aware that he was under a disqualification order when he drove the car on 3 December 2021.

#### Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law

36     It was submitted that the accused had made a spontaneous decision to drive the car as he was unable to find a driver to drive it to his residence and that a customer was going to collect the car in the morning. I found it odd that the accused would make a spontaneous decision at 2:30am to collect the car when he was aware that a customer was going to collect the car that very morning. In my view, it was more likely that the accused had intentionally and in flagrant disregard of the law chosen to drive the car in the early hours of the morning in the hope of evading detection by the police.

37     In addition, I was mindful that in the present case, a charge under s 177(1)(_a_) of the Penal Code had been taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. The accused had admitted that he had furnished false information in respect of his NRIC number to the complainant at the material time. In my view, this is an aggravating factor as he had sought to conceal his wrongdoing from the complainant.

#### Significant distance travelled

38     The accused had driven from Golden Hill Estate and intended to drive back to his residence at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 but was stopped along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 towards Upper Thomson Road. The Defence had argued that it did not appear that the accused had driven for a long distance. With respect, this estimation is inaccurate as a Google Map search indicates that the distance between Goldhill and his residence is between 10.8 km and 12.3 km depending on the route taken. Hence, it was clear that the accused had driven a significant distance before he was stopped by the complainant.

#### Length of time from expiry of the original disqualification order

39     By then, the accused was almost at the 7-month mark of his 12 months’ disqualification order. Although I agreed with the Defence that it was not a situation of the accused having offended early into the disqualification, he still had another five months of his disqualification to serve before he was permitted to take the requisite steps to obtain his driving licence again.

40     Based on the above factors, there were clearly no extenuating or exceptional circumstances for the accused to drive while under a disqualification order. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that there were no good reasons to depart from the usual sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment and to impose a non-custodial sentence as submitted by the Defence.

41     In the alternative, the Defence had urged the Court to impose a sentence of between four to six weeks’ imprisonment. In my view, such a sentence could only be considered had the offence been committed prior to 1 November 2019. In the present case, as the accused had intentionally and in flagrant disregard of the law, chosen to drive the car on 3 December 2021 for a significant distance, a sentence below the starting point of eight weeks’ imprisonment would clearly be inadequate. Furthermore, he had sought to evade detection when he gave false information in relation to his particulars to the complainant.

42     Based on the above and as there were no exceptional circumstance that warranted a departure from the imposition of the usual custodial sentence, I was of the view that a custodial sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment for the s 43(4)(_a_) of the RTA charge was fair and justified.

#### Disqualification order

43     As observed by Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Muhammad Saiful_ at \[18\] a disqualification period shorter than the original disqualification period would do little to deter future like-minded offenders. It is an important punitive element for offences of drink driving and under s 43(4) of the RTA. He further observed at \[19\] that a disqualification order also prevents these offenders from driving and endangering themselves and other road users. The imposition of another, longer disqualification period would help ensure that such drivers are kept off the roads for a longer period of time.

44     In view of the above, I was of the view that a disqualification order for a period of 24 months for all classes of vehicles was necessary both as a form of specific and general deterrence. A disqualification order that is twice the original order is also necessary as a form of punitive element in the present case in view of the aggravating circumstances in the present case. Furthermore, in the present case, there were no mitigating circumstances which would suggest that a 24-month period is disproportionate. Hence, a 12-month disqualification period as submitted by the Defence would clearly be inadequate.

45     I had ordered the disqualification order to take effect from the date of release as the starting point where an accused is sentenced to a disqualification order as well as a period of imprisonment, the former should commence at the end of the period of imprisonment. This follows as a matter of common sense since an accused would already be physically incapacitated from driving during his term of imprisonment without any need for a disqualification and an overlap between a disqualification order and a concurrent term of imprisonment would undermine the penal effect of the disqualification order (see _Muhammad Saiful_ at \[39\] and \[46(a)\].

### S 3(1) of the MVA

46     As set out above, the accused was previously convicted for a similar offence under s 3(1) of the MVA on 11 May 2021. This sentence had not been set aside as no appeal was filed against this sentence. As the accused was previously fined $600 and disqualified for a 12-month period, the same sentence as proposed by the Defence would be wholly inadequate. Furthermore, I noted that the Defence had not pointed to any special reasons for the Court not to impose a disqualification order or a shorter period of disqualification. In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the maximum fine of $1,000 should be imposed on the accused in view of his re-offending within seven months after his earlier conviction.

47     In the present case, a disqualification order for a period of 24 months for all classes of vehicles was necessary both as a form of specific and general deterrence. A disqualification order that is twice the original order is also necessary as a form of punitive element in the present case, in view of the aggravating circumstances in the present case. I had ordered the disqualification to take effect from the date of conviction as expressly provided under s 3(3) of the MVA.

48     In my view, a fine of $1,000 in default five days’ imprisonment and disqualification for a period of 24 months from the date of conviction was fair and justified in the circumstances.

## Conclusion

49     The accused was aware that his disqualification order for his previous offences commenced from 11 May 2021. His offences were discovered when he was stopped for checks by the complainant along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 in the early hours of 3 December 2021 when he was on the way home. This present case serves to illustrate the difficulty in detecting such offences under the RTA and the MVA and the need to impose deterrent sentences as part of the Court’s sentencing consideration.
