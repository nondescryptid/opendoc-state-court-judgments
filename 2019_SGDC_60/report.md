## Facts

3       Mr Effrizan admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts, which set out the following material facts.

4       On 8 October 2018, at about 11.30 p.m., police officers conducted a check on Mr Effrizan at 50 Kallang Road, Lavender MRT Station, Singapore.

5       The police officers seized the following items from Mr Effrizan:

(a)     one straw and one packet containing granular/powdery substance (later collectively marked “EK-A1”);

(b)     one packet containing crystalline substance (later marked “EK-A2”); and

(c)     two aluminium foils and one rolled up paper (later collectively marked “EK-A3”).

6       Mr Effrizan admitted to ownership of the aforementioned seized items. Mr Effrizan was then arrested on suspicion of having committed offences under the MDA and brought to the Central Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations.

### Facts pertaining to DAC-934306-2018 (the “Repeat LT2 Charge”)

7       Following his arrest, on 9 October 2018, Mr Effrizan provided two bottles of his urine samples which were marked and sealed in his presence. These were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (the “**HSA**”) for analysis on the same day.

8       The two urine samples were analysed, and two certificates were issued by HSA analysts Chan Si Jia and Kwok Yi Ling Miiko under section 16 of the MDA, bearing Lab. No. AT-1833-09773-001-031 and Lab. No. AT-1833-09773-002-03 respectively. Both the certificates stated that on analysis, the urine samples analysed contained methamphetamine.

9       Methamphetamine is a Specific Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

10     Mr Effrizan admitted to consuming “ice” prior to his arrest. “Ice” is the street name for methamphetamine. To consume “ice”, Mr Effrizan used the “chasing the dragon method”, in that he put some “ice” on a piece of aluminium foil. He then heated the bottom of the foil and inhaled the “ice” fumes with a piece of rolled up paper.

11     Mr Effrizan was not authorised to consume methamphetamine under the MDA or any regulations made thereunder. He has therefore committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

12     Further, Mr Effrizan had, on 27 July 2001, been convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, being morphine, under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and had been punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA with five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to-date. Mr Effrizan shall therefore now be punished under section 33A(2) of the MDA (for ease of reference, offences punishable under section 33A(2) of the MDA will be referred to in the remainder of these grounds as “**LT2**” offences).

### Facts pertaining to DAC-938608-2018 (the “Enhanced Possession Charge”)

13     On 15 October 2018, the exhibit marked “EK-A2” was sealed in a tamper-proof bag and sent to the HSA for analysis.

14     On 9 November 2018, Chin Shi Liy Reenie, an analyst from the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate bearing Lab No. ID-1832-02478-002 under section 16 of the MDA, stating that the exhibit marked “EK-A2” was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.54 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.36 gram of methamphetamine.

15     Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

16     Mr Effrizan admitted knowing that the exhibit referred to in \[13\] above contained methamphetamine. He admitted that on 8 October at about 11.30pm, he was in possession of the said exhibit, which was meant for his own consumption.

17     Mr Effrizan is not authorised under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to have in his possession a Class A Controlled Drug. He has thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA.

18     Mr Effrizan had previously on 22 June 2005 been convicted of an offence of possession of a Controlled Drug under Section 8(a) of the MDA and had been sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. The conviction has not been set aside to-date. He shall now be liable for enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA.

### Facts pertaining to DAC-938610-2018 (the “Drug Utensils Charge”)

19     The exhibits collectively marked “EK-A3” comprised two aluminium foils and one rolled up paper.

20     The accused admitted that on 8 October 2018, he was in possession of exhibit “EK-A3”, which are utensils intended for the consumption of a Class A Controlled Drug, methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. Mr Effrizan has thereby committed an offence under section 9 punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

## Charges Taken into Consideration for the Purposes of Sentencing

21     Mr Effrizan consented to having two other charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. These two charges are respectively:

(a)     DAC-934307-2018: Consumption of monoacetylmorphine, a Specified Drug, under section 8(b)(ii) punishable under section 33A(2) of the MDA; and

(b)     DAC-938609-2018: Possession of a Class A Controlled Drug, to wit, one straw and one packet containing not less than 2.56 grams of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.05 gram of diamorphine under section 8(a) punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

23     In addition to the foregoing convictions, based on the records tendered by the prosecution, Mr Effrizan has been the subject of a number of rehabilitation as well as supervision orders dating back to 1996.

## The parties’ submissions

### Prosecution’s submissions

24     Before me, the prosecution sought the following sentences:

(a)     In respect of the Repeat LT2 Charge, seven years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane;

(b)     In respect of the Enhanced Possession Charge, two years’ imprisonment; and

(c)     In respect of the Drug Utensils Charge, three months’ imprisonment.

25     The prosecution was also content for the Repeat LT2 Charge and the Drug Utensils Charge to run consecutively.

26     In seeking a sentence of seven years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the Repeat LT2 Charge, the prosecution highlighted that Mr Effrizan was a repeat LT2 offender and that a sentence of seven years and three months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane had been imposed the last time Mr Effrizan had been convicted of an LT2 offence in 2012. The sentence sought by the prosecution for the Repeat LT2 Charge therefore represented a three-month uplift from that imposed for Mr Effrizan’s previous LT2 conviction.

27     As for the sentence sought in respect of the Enhanced Possession Charge, it was pointed out that this was the minimum length of the sentence which could be imposed on Mr Effrizan pursuant to section 33(1) of the MDA as he has already been convicted once before of possession of a controlled drug in 2005.

### Mr Effrizan’s submissions

28     Mr Effrizan tendered two letters in mitigation.

29     In his first letter, dated 7 December 2018, Mr Effrizan made a general appeal for leniency and highlighted that he is presently responsible for the care of his elderly parents. In this letter, he also appeared to attributed his relapse into drugs to a strong desire to show his family that he was still able to succeed notwithstanding his previous convictions, with the consequence that he overlooked the importance of living in moderation.

30     Mr Effrizan’s second letter tendered in mitigation was dated 4 March 2019 and took a decidedly different approach. In the main, in this second letter, Mr Effrizan appealed to this Court to sentence him to “D.R.C.” (which I understood to be a reference to “drug rehabilitation centre”) instead of imprisonment under the LT2 regime, on the basis that he should be classified as a “pure abuser”. In support of this request, Mr Effrizan made reference to “new changes on the \[MDA\] Amendment” as well as to two persons, identified as one “Salim” and one “Aziz” who had apparently enjoyed “conversion” from the “LT” to “DRC”.

31     Neither of Mr Effrizan’s two letters made any express mention of the Enhanced Possession Charge or the Drug Utensils Charge.

## The appropriate sentence for each charge

### Repeat LT2 Charge

32     Mr Effrizan appeared to believe that whilst he was liable to be punished as an LT2 offender, that is, pursuant to section 33A(2) of the MDA, he was nevertheless entitled, as a “pure abuser”, to be sentenced instead to some other manner of regime in a drug rehabilitation centre due to “new changes” to the MDA.

33     Based on Mr Effrizan’s reference to “pure abusers” and “new changes” to the MDA, I understood Mr Effrizan to be referring, in his second mitigation letter, to recent amendments to the MDA that have been tabled in Parliament In the form of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill (Bill No. 51/2018, the “**Bill**”).

34     The Minister, in his speech during the second reading of the Bill on 15 January 2019, had made reference to a category of “pure” drug abusers as persons who “only consume drugs” as being distinct from “those who also face charges for other offences. For example, trafficking, property offences, violent offences”.

35     Insofar as Mr Effrizan was seeking to rely on the Bill in support of his request to be sentenced to “DRC”, this point may be dealt with in short order – whilst the Bill was passed in Parliament on 15 January 2019, as at the date of Mr Effrizan’s sentencing on 4 March 2019, the amendments introduced by the Bill had yet to come into operation.

36     Accordingly, in ascertaining the sentencing options available to this Court in the instant matter, no regard can be had to the provisions of the Bill. For the avoidance of doubt, in stating the foregoing, this Court is not to be taken as expressing a view as to the effect of the amendments to be introduced by the Bill. In particular, nothing in these Grounds should be construed as an indication that Mr Effrizan’s arguments would be successful if only the provisions of the Bill were already in force when he was sentenced on 4 March 2019.

37     I turn then to the provisions of the MDA as it stood as at 4 March 2019, being the date when Mr Effrizan was sentenced. The relevant provision in this regard is section 33A(2) of the MDA, which provides that

(2)    Where a person who has been punished under subsection (1) is again convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b) or an offence of failure to provide a urine specimen under section 31(2), he shall on conviction be punished with —

(a)    imprisonment of not less than 7 years and not more than 13 years; and

(b)    not less than 6 strokes and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.

38     It will be apparent from the foregoing that once an accused person has been convicted of an offence punishable under section 33A(2) of the MDA, the Court is to impose the punishment provided for thereunder. No basis was made known to this Court for sentencing Mr Effrizan, in respect of the Repeat LT2 Charge, in any other manner.

39     As to the sentence of imprisonment and caning to be passed, I begin by noting that deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle for the Repeat LT2 Charge.

40     Bearing the foregoing in mind, the length of the sentence imposed as a result of Mr Effrizan’s previous LT2 conviction must be one highly relevant factor. As highlighted earlier, Mr Effrizan was sentenced to seven years and three months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for his previous LT2 conviction in 2012.

41     Notwithstanding the substantial term of imprisonment mentioned in the preceding paragraph, which was imposed only in 2012, Mr Effrizan has now been convicted again of an LT2 offence.

42     It was observed by Choo Han Teck J in _PP v Ali bin Bakar_ \[2012\] SGHC at \[6\] that,

In crime, higher frequency must generally attract harsher punishment unless there are good reasons to the contrary.

43     Consistent with the above-cited principle, in my view the custodial sentence to be imposed cannot be shorter than the seven years and three months’ imprisonment imposed in respect of Mr Effrizan’s previous LT2 conviction. This is because there is no reason to believe that the deterrent effect of a custodial sentence of less than seven years three months in respect of the Repeat LT2 Charge would, if imposed, be sufficient to meet the need for specific deterrence.

44     To the contrary, it is relevant that not only did the sentence imposed for his last LT2 conviction not have the requisite deterrent effect, Mr Effrizan’s current LT2 offence was committed within what would have been a relatively short period (around two years) from when he completed serving the sentence for his previous LT2 conviction.

45     Account also has to be taken, in my view, of the fact that apart from the three charges of which he was convicted, two other drug-related charges were also taken into consideration, one of which was for the consumption of a different specified drug, being monoacetylmorphine.

46     All in all, therefore, the relatively modest three-month uplift sought by the prosecution for the custodial element of the sentence imposed on Mr Effrizan for his last LT2 conviction was appropriate.

47     Similar reasoning applies to the six strokes of caning sought by prosecution for the Repeat LT2 Charge. This was the same number of strokes imposed for Mr Effrizan’s previous LT2 conviction in 2012 and there is no reason to believe that a lower number would meet the need for specific deterrence for his latest conviction.

48     Separately, as I have highlighted earlier, Mr Effrizan sought to attribute his relapse into drugs to his desire to prove himself to his family following his previous convictions. With respect, I see no basis for treating these circumstances as a factor that should be recognised in mitigation of the sentence to be imposed for the Repeat LT2 Charge.

49     By virtue of the foregoing, I agreed with the prosecution’s sentencing position and imposed a sentence of seven years and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the Repeat LT2 offence.

### Enhanced Possession Charge

50     The facts of this charge are summarised in \[13\] to \[18\] above. As Mr Effrizan had, on 22 June 2005 been previously convicted of an offence of possession of a controlled drug pursuant to section 8(a) of the MDA, upon being convicted of the Enhanced Possession Charge, he was liable to enhanced punishment under section 33(1) of the MDA such that the minimum sentence to be imposed for the Enhanced Possession Charge would be two years’ imprisonment.

51     The prosecution sought the aforesaid statutory minimum term of imprisonment. I also note that for his previous conviction of possession of a controlled drug, a sentence of 15 months was imposed on Mr Effrizan.

52     In the premises, I saw no reason to depart from the prosecution’s submission and duly imposed the statutory minimum of two years’ imprisonment for the Enhanced Possession Charge.

### Drug Utensils Charge

53     As noted earlier, the prosecution sought a sentence of three months’ imprisonment for the Drug Utensils Charge.

54     I note that whilst this was the first occasion on which he had been convicted under section 9 of the MDA, Mr Effrizan has a significant number of previous convictions for drug-related offences.

55     I was of the view that the sentence of three months’ imprisonment sought by prosecution was reasonable. This sentence is broadly in line with the sentencing trends found from a search of the Sentencing Information and Research Repository for males above the age of 21 years old who pleaded guilty to offences under section 9 of the MDA, as the median sentence passed in the 10-year period between 4 March 2009 and 4 March 2019 was 12.9 weeks (ie. around 3 months).

## The aggregate sentence

56     As Mr Effrizan was convicted and to be sentenced to imprisonment for three distinct offences, pursuant to section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed, the “**CPC**”), this Court was obliged to order the sentences for at least two of those offences to run consecutively. As was recognised by the Court of Appeal in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ (“**Mohamed Shouffee**”) at \[77\], to properly give effect to section 307(1) of the CPC, the

… total term of imprisonment for the sentences that are ordered to run consecutively must exceed the term of imprisonment that is imposed for the highest individual sentence.

57     It will be appreciated that the custodial element of the sentence imposed for the Repeat LT2 Charge, being seven years and six months’ imprisonment, exceeds by some distance the custodial sentence for the Enhanced Possession Charge (two years’ imprisonment) and the Drug Utensils Charge (three months’ imprisonment) and, indeed, even the _sum_ of the custodial sentences imposed for the latter two offences. Therefore, in order to give effect to section 307(1) of the CPC, the Repeat LT2 Charge must be one of the charges ordered to run consecutively.

58     The next question to be considered is whether the Enhanced Possession Charge, the Drug Utensils Charge or both of these should be ordered to run consecutively with the Repeat LT2 Charge.

59     The answer to be the foregoing is to be found in a consideration of two other principles which were referred to by the Court of Appeal in _Mohamed Shouffee_, namely, the one-transaction rule and the totality principle.

60     Turning first to the “one-transaction” rule, this was described by the Court of Appeal at \[32\] of its judgment in _Mohamed Shouffee_ as

… an evaluative rule that is directed towards the ultimate enquiry that a sentencing court is engaged in: whether an offender should be doubly punished for offences that have been committed simultaneously or close together in time.

61     Further, the one-transaction rule is to serve

… as a filter to sieve out those sentences that ought not as a general rule to be ordered to be run consecutively.

62     Mr Effrizan was arrested on 8 October 2018 at about 11.30am and, at this time, had seized from him the items which formed the subject matter of both the Enhanced Possession Charge as well as the Drug Utensils Charge.

63     I note that the drug which formed the subject matter of the Enhanced Possession Charge was methamphetamine whilst it was also admitted that the items forming the subject matter of the Drug Utensils Charge were utensils to be used in the consumption of methamphetamine (_vide_ \[16\] and \[20\] above).

64     Further, the Repeat LT2 Charge stems from the consumption of methamphetamine on or about 8 October prior to his arrest.

65     Given the common identity of the drug forming the subject matter of all three charges for which Mr Effrizan was convicted as well as the fact that the acts of consumption and possession (of both drug and drug paraphernalia) forming the subject matter of the charge were linked very closely in time and space, I had no difficulty in concluding that it would be inappropriate to order all three charges to run consecutively as in my view that would clearly offend the one-transaction rule. The question which remains therefore is which of the Enhanced Possession Charge and the Drug Utensils Charge ought to be ordered to run consecutively with the Repeat LT2 Charge so as to give effect to section 307(1) of the CPC.

66     In considering this issue, regard must be had to totality principle espoused by the Court of Appeal in _Mohamed Shouffee._

67     In _Mohamed Shouffee_ the Court of the Appeal cited with approval the following formulation of the totality principle:

\[T\]he principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender a ‘crushing sentence’ not in keeping with his record and prospects.

68     After considering the facts of the case before me, for the reasons set out below, I ordered the imprisonment sentence for the Repeat LT2 Charge to run consecutively with the imprisonment sentence for the Drug Utensils Charge, leading to an aggregate imprisonment sentence of seven years and nine months’ imprisonment.

69     I first considered that Mr Effrizan’s conviction on the Repeat LT2 Charge is the most serious of the three charges for which he has now been convicted, given that this carries an imprisonment sentence of between seven and 13 years as well as caning.

70     If I had ordered the Enhanced Possession Charge (for which the statutory minimum of two years’ imprisonment had been imposed) to run consecutively with the Repeat LT2 Charge, this would have resulted in an aggregate sentence of nine years six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

71     I note that Mr Effrizan was sentenced to seven years and three months’ imprisonment (in addition to caning) for his previous LT2 conviction in 2012.

72     Juxtaposed against the sentence imposed for his previous conviction, I took the view that an aggregate sentence of nine years six months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane would have been “substantially above the normal level of sentences” for the circumstances surrounding Repeat LT2 Charge and thus offend the totality principle.

73     I note that in _Cheang Geok Lin v PP_ , Sundaresh Menon CJ remarked that the sentence for a second LT2 conviction should be a term of imprisonment of about eight years (_vide_ \[34\] of the judgment). In particular, in _Cheang Geok Lin_, Menon CJ noted with apparent approval the decision in _Yusran bin Yusoff v PP_ , wherein a sentence of eight years’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane for a second LT2 conviction had been upheld.

74     Further, an imprisonment sentence of nine years and six months would be substantially harsher than that which the prosecution had sought for the Repeat LT2 Charge. This would also be a significant uplift on the sentence imposed for Mr Effrizan’s last LT2 conviction in 2012 (seven years and 3 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane) as well as the sentence imposed for the drug _trafficking_ charge of which Mr Effrizan had been convicted in 2005 (eight years’ imprisonment with eight strokes of the cane).

75     It also bears adding that ordering the Repeat LT2 Charge and the Enhanced Possession Charge to run consecutively would make it difficult to adjust the individual sentences so as to meet the requirements of the totality principle, as the statutory minimum had already been imposed for the Enhanced Possession Charge and the sentence for the Repeat LT2 Charge involved only a minimal uplift from Mr Effrizan’s previous LT2 conviction.

76     Conversely, ordering the Repeat LT2 Charge and the Drug Utensils Charge to run consecutively resulted in an aggregate sentence of seven years and nine months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane. In my view, this would meet the requirements of the totality principle.

77     First, an aggregate sentence of seven years and nine months’ imprisonment with six strokes of the cane is not substantially above the normal level of sentences for a repeat LT2 offence (_vide_ \[73\] above).

78     Secondly, I did not consider that such an aggregate sentence would be crushing on Mr Effrizan and not in keeping with his record and prospects.

79     Mr Effrizan was 39 years old at the time of sentencing. He is thus not yet at an age where the aggregate sentence imposed herein could be regarded as crushing and excessive as he would be in his forties when he has completed serving the said sentence.

80     Further, as will be noted from the list of antecedents reproduced at \[22\] above, Mr Effrizan’s association with drugs extends to 1994 and has seen him subjected to no fewer than three separate sentences of at least five years’ imprisonment. In addition, his most recent conviction in 2012 was also for an LT2 offence, for which a sentence not very different from the aggregate sentence passed herein was imposed. In light of these considerations, in my view it cannot be said that the aggregate sentence imposed herein is not in keeping with Mr Effrizan’s past record and prospects.

## Conclusion

81     By reason of the foregoing, Mr Effrizan was sentenced to an aggregate of seven years and nine months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, with the individual sentences set out at \[2\] above. The commencement date of the aggregate imprisonment term was backdated to 17 October 2018, the date of Mr Effrizan’s remand.
