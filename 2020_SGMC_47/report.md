Criminal Law – Penal Code Offence – Theft

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Prisons Act – Enhanced sentence for breach of basic condition of remission order

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9834/202/01.\]

22 October 2020

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the accused, a 62-year-old male Singapore citizen. On 24 June 2020, he pleaded guilty to one charge of theft under s 379 of the Penal Code, (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”) and he was also liable for enhanced sentence of 706 days under s 50T(1)(a) of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed) (“PA””) for breaching the basic condition of his remission order. On 20 July 2020, I sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment and enhanced sentence of 176 days. On the accused’s request, I allowed him to commence serving his sentence on 3 August 2020.

2       On 1 October 2020, by consent, the High Court granted the accused’s application for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal within 14 days. On 2 October 2020, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal stating that he was dissatisfied with his sentence. I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The charge

3       The charge (exhibit C1A) that the accused pleaded guilty to read as follows (“the Theft Charge):

> Charge

> You, are charged that you, on 5 April 2020, at about 12.07 p.m., outside the New Econ Supermarket at Block 103 Yishun Ring Road #XXX, Singapore, did commit theft of cash amounting to S$110.00, out of the possession of Tan Bock Kwee, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed),

> and further, that you, from 11 November 2019 to 11 March 2022, were subjected to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap. 247, Rev. Ed. 2014) (“PA”) which remission order is subjected to the basic condition under Section 50S(1) of the PA and while the remission order is in effect you, on 5 April 2020, committed the aforesaid offence and upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under Section 50S(1)(b) of the PA, shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order, and you are thereby liable to be punished under Section 50T(1)(a) of the PA with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 706 Days from 5 April 2020 to 11 March 2022 for that offence.

## The statement of facts

4       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts without qualification:

> The accused is Kamsani Bin Ani, male / 62 years old (Date of Birth: 22 May 1958), a Singaporean bearing NRIC No. SXXX. At the material time, the accused was employed as a cleaner.

> 2    The victim is Tan Bock Kwee, male / 86 years old, a Singaporean.

> 3    The informant is Tan Guan Yu, male / 29 years old, a Singaporean. He is the store manager of New Econ Supermarket located at Block 103 Yishun Ring Road #XXX, Singapore (“the store”).

> **FIRST INFORMATION REPORT**

> 4    On 5 April 2020 at about 12.34 p.m., the informant called for police assistance after the victim approached him and informed that someone had picked his pocket outside the store.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO MAC-904210-2020 - THEFT**

> 5    Investigations revealed that on 5 April 2020 at about 12.07 p.m., the victim was outside the store when he took out cash amounting to S$110.00 from his wallet and placed them in the left pocket of his tee-shirt. Shortly after, the victim saw the accused walking towards him and thereafter grazed against his body.

> 6    Suspecting something amiss, the victim checked his T-shirt pocket and discovered that the S$110.00 cash that he had just placed therein was missing. Alarmed, the victim quickly approached the informant to seek the latter’s assistance to view the store’s CCTV that was facing the exit of the store. The CCTV footages showed the accused coming very close to the victim.

> 7    From the CCTV footages and follow-up investigations, the Police managed to trace the accused to his residence. When the Police interviewed the accused, he admitted to the theft. The accused also admitted that as he was coming out of the store, he saw a stack of cash protruding out of the victim’s T-shirt pocket. When he saw the cash, he formed the dishonest intention to steal it. As such, he decided to walk very close to the victim and thereafter used his right hand to remove the stack of cash from the victim’s T-shirt pocket.

> 8    The accused surrendered the cash amounting to S$110.00 to the Police and it was seized as case exhibit. He was then arrested.

> 9    By committing theft of the cash amounting to S$110.00, out of the possession of the victim and without the latter’s consent, the accused has committed an offence of theft, punishable under s 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> **BREACH OF CONDITIONAL REMISSION ORDER**

> 10    Investigations further revealed that from **11 November 2019 to 11 March 2022**, the accused is subjected to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“PA”) which remission order is subjected to the basic condition under s 50S(1) of the PA. While the remission order is in effect, the accused, on **5 April 2020**, committed the aforesaid offence. Upon his conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under s 50S(1)(b) of the PA, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of your remission order. He is thereby liable to be punished under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, i.e. **706 Days** from **5 April 2020** to **11 March 2022** for that offence.

> 11    The accused admits to the offence and stands charged accordingly.

## Antecedents

5       The accused had a string of property and drug antecedents. When his property antecedents were read out during his plead guilty mention on 24 June 2020, the accused had disputed the accuracy of the sentence that he received on 16 December 2011 in respect of a theft in dwelling charge under s 380 of the PC. Serial number 23 of the criminal records (see exhibit P5) reflected that the accused was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, but the accused informed the court that the sentence he had received was 15 months’ imprisonment. The matter was thus adjourned to 20 July 2020 to enable the Prosecution to verify the sentence. On 20 July 2020, the Prosecution tendered a Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions (Theft Related Offences Only) (see exhibit P9) which confirmed that the accused’s version that he had received a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment in 2011 was correct.

6       The accused’s previous convictions are tabulated below with his theft related antecedents highlighted for easy reference.

8       The Prosecution submitted for at least 12 months’ imprisonment for the Theft Charge and at least 176 days of enhanced sentence (see Prosecution’s Sentencing Position at exhibit P6). It highlighted the following aggravating factors to justify the 12 months’ imprisonment term it was seeking:

> (a)     The accused had a lengthy list of theft and theft-in-dwelling antecedents and the Theft charge in the present case was his 14th conviction for a similar offence.

> (b)     His last sentence for theft under s 379 of the PC involving a sum of $279 (recovered) was in 2013 where he was given 15 months’ imprisonment.

> (c)     After his release from prison, the accused went on to commit drug offences and he was convicted on 21 May 2015 for an LT2 offence and a drug possession offence. Therefore, the fact that his last theft antecedent was in 2013 should be given little weight.

> (d)     Not long after his last release from prison in 2019, the accused again re-offended by committing the present offence on an elderly victim. The accused was clearly not deterred by lengthy incarceration.

9       In respect of the accused’s liability for enhanced punishment under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA, s 50T(3) of the PA lays down four factors (“the four factors”) which the court is required to consider before it imposes any enhanced sentence. In this regard, the Prosecution had put forth a proposed sentencing framework (see exhibit P7) and submitted that an enhanced sentence of at least 176 days out of the maximum length of 706 days should be imposed. I reproduce below the Prosecution’s analysis of the four factors in the present case:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.08%"> <col width="67.92%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factor</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Analysis</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Section 50T(3)(<em>a</em>):</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">the gravity of the offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">· The nature of the present offence of theft is relatively minor.

10     Having analysed that the accused’s overall level of recalcitrance was generally low, the Prosecution next proposed that the indicative starting point for the enhanced sentence should be calibrated according to the following sentencing bands:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.22%"> <col width="49.04%"> <col width="37.74%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Description</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range (for a claim trial case)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low level of recalcitrance</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>1 day to 1/3</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate level of recalcitrance</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>1/3 to 2/3</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High level of recalcitrance</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>2/3 to maximum</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

11     The Prosecution put the accused’s overall level of recalcitrance at the lower end of Band 2 and submitted that the indicative starting enhanced sentence would be 235 days, 1/3 of the maximum sentence of 706 days.

12     As the accused had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, the Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting sentence should be adjusted downwards, and it therefore submitted for at least 176 days of enhanced sentence _ie_ 3/4 of 235 days.

## Mitigation plea

13     The accused told the court that he was a father of 2 sons. His wife had just been discharged from hospital due to a mild stroke and he was her caregiver. He suffered from diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol and eczema. He knew what he had done was wrong and he regretted what he had done. He also requested for the minimum sentence and he asked for his sentence to be concurrent sentences. He further asked to be allowed to defer his sentence to after Hari Raya Haji.

## Prescribed punishments

14     The prescribed punishment for an offence of theft under s 379 of the PC is an imprisonment term of up to three years or fine or both. Pursuant to s 50T(2)(b) of the PA, the maximum length of the enhanced sentence that could be imposed in the present case was 706 days which was the remaining duration of the remission order (see exhibit P4).

## Sentencing considerations

### The Theft Charge

15     The dominant sentencing principle in this case would be that of deterrence. The relevant sentencing factors for theft would include the value of the item stolen, the circumstances of the offence, whether it involved a vulnerable victim and if the accused had similar antecedents.

16     The accused was first convicted of theft under s 379 of the PC in 1977, more than 40 years ago, for which he was given a fine. Although he was involved in drug offences between 1977 and 2006, he managed to stay away from property offences for almost 30 years until 2006 when he was convicted of his second theft related offence under s 380 of the PC. Regrettably, he had not stopped re-offending since his second theft related conviction in 2006. He continued to commit theft related offences even though he was receiving increasingly longer sentences. His last theft conviction was under s 379 of the PC in December 2013 for stealing $274 from a fish stall for which he was given a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment (“2013 theft conviction”). In that case, acting on information provided, the police managed to arrest the accused and recovered the stolen sum of $274 (see the statement of facts at exhibit P8). Despite having served 15 months’ imprisonment for his 2013 theft conviction, the accused was undeterred, and he went on to commit the present offence.

17     For the present offence, it was through the efforts of the police in viewing the CCTV footages and follow-up investigations that the accused was apprehended. It was aggravating that the accused had pickpocketed from a particularly vulnerable victim, an elderly victim aged 86. Nonetheless I noted that the amount pickpocketed was $110 which was lower than the stolen sum of $274 in his 2013 theft conviction. I also considered the fact that the offence did not appear to have been pre-planned.

18     There was an interval of a few years between the accused’s 2013 theft conviction and the present offence which he committed in April 2020. In this regard, it would be important to note that not long after his release from serving the 15 months’ imprisonment for his 2013 theft conviction, the accused was convicted of drug offences in 2015 including a LT2 charge for which he was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment. I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that little weight should be given to the fact that the accused did not re-offend in the interim for the simple reason that the accused was being incarcerated for drug offences during this period.

19     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I also considered the accused’s early plea of guilt and that he had surrendered the sum of $110 which he pickpocketed.

20     Given the circumstances of this case, the accused’s lengthy theft related antecedents and having regard to his last sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment for his 2013 theft conviction which involved a bigger value, I was of the view that 12 months’ imprisonment term was an appropriate sentence and I sentenced the accused accordingly for the theft charge.

### Enhanced sentence under s 50T(1)(a) of the PA

21     The relevant provisions of s 50T of the PA stipulate as follows:

> (1)    When a person commits an offence in breach of the basic condition of his remission order made under Division 2 or 3, the court may, in addition to imposing any sentence on the person for that offence, impose an enhanced sentence for that offence as follows:

>> (a)    Imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order, as determined based on the date of the commission of the offence.

> ………………….

> (3)    In deciding whether to impose any enhanced sentence under subsection (1) or (2) with respect to any offence, and if so the length of the enhanced sentence, the court shall consider —

>> (a)    the gravity of the offence

>> (b)    whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced;

>> (c)    the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and

>> (d)    all other relevant circumstances;

> ………………….

> (5) Notwithstanding any provision in any written law, **a term of imprisonment imposed on any person as an enhanced sentence under this section shall run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed on him**.

> \[emphasis in bold mine\]

22     S 50T(3) of the PA makes it clear that the court must first consider whether or not to impose an enhanced sentence and if it so decides that an enhanced sentence is warranted, the court must next consider the length of the enhanced sentence subject to the remaining duration of a person’s remission order. S 50T(3) also requires the court to have regard to the four factors set out under s 50T(3)(a) to (d) in its deliberation of the matter. The four factors are: (a) the gravity of the offence, (b) whether the offence is of a similar nature to the offence for which the person under a remission order was originally sentenced, (c) the length of time for which the person did not commit any offence after being released under that remission order; and (d) all other relevant circumstances.

23     The accused was placed on a remission order for a period of two years and four months from 11 November 2019 to 11 March 2022 in relation to drug offences. The accused was fully aware of the consequences of any breach of the order as he had acknowledged that the contents had been fully explained to him and fully understood by him when he signed on it on 11 November 2019 (see exhibit P2). In the present case, having regard to the four factors, I was satisfied that an enhanced sentence ought to be imposed. The Theft Charge was not a grave offence given that it was punishable with a fine or maximum imprisonment of three years or both. It was also dissimilar in nature from the drug offences. Nonetheless, the accused committed the Theft Charge less than five months into his remission order. I was therefore of the view that an enhanced sentence was warranted to address the accused’s recalcitrant conduct of re-offending.

24     In respect of the appropriate length of enhanced sentence to be imposed, I found the Prosecution’s proposed sentencing approach and framework to be persuasive. In this regard, there seemed to be some confusion in the Prosecution’s specific submissions for this case. On one hand, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s overall level of recalcitrance was “generally low” but on the other hand, it submitted that he would come within its proposed sentencing Band 2 under “Moderate Level of recalcitrance” (see the tables at \[9\] and \[10\] above). In any event, the Prosecution’s submission that the indicative starting sentence should be 1/3 of the maximum sentence of 706 days _ie_ 235 days would also place the accused’s level of culpability under Band 1.

25     Notwithstanding that an enhanced sentence was necessary in this case, given that the breaching offence ie the Theft Charge was not grave in nature and dissimilar to the drug offences, I was of the view that the appropriate range of enhanced sentence should fall under Band 1 _ie_ between one day to 235 days. It was also significant and relevant that the accused pleaded guilty to the Theft Charge. As such, I agreed with the Prosecution that there should be a further discount to the indicative starting sentence of 235 days. The Prosecution submitted that the enhanced sentence in this case should be 176 days after the further discount. Overall, I thought that enhanced sentence which the Prosecution was submitting for was fair. Accordingly, I imposed an enhanced sentence of 176 days in this case.

### Whether the enhanced sentence should run concurrently or consecutively

26     Under the law, an enhanced sentence is required to run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment because s 50T(5) of the PA provides as follows:

> Notwithstanding any provision in any written law, **a term of imprisonment imposed on any person as an enhanced sentence under this section shall run consecutively to all other terms of imprisonment imposed on him**.

> \[emphasis in bold mine\]

27     During his mitigation plea, the accused had urged the court to order his sentence for the Theft Charge to run concurrently with the enhanced sentence. At that time, the State Prosecuting Officer had pointed out in court that the sentences could not be concurrent[^1]. I had then also informed the accused that it “has to run consecutively”[^2] prior to pronouncing the sentence. It has now come to my attention that when I delivered the sentence that the accused was to serve 12 months’ imprisonment for the Theft Charge and 176 days for breach of the conditional remission order, I had inadvertently said that “the sentences had to be concurrent because that was the law”[^3]. I had clearly meant to say that the sentences had to be consecutive because the law did not allow the court to order otherwise.

## Conclusion

28     On the facts of this case, I was of the view that the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and enhanced sentence of 176 days was fair and appropriate.

29     The accused is currently serving his sentence.
