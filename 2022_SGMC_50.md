Criminal Law – Voluntarily causing hurt – Vulnerable victim

25 August 2022

### District Judge Soh Tze Bian:

## CHARGE

1       The accused person, Ng Koon Poh (“AP”) who was unrepresented had claimed trial to the following charge:

> “…you on the 8th day of August 2021, at or about 6.20pm, at Apt Blk 326A Sumang Walk #XXX, Singapore 821326, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Chong Yoke Sin (“_the victim_”), a vulnerable victim as he is visually impaired, to wit, by using your hand to punch the victim’s left eye area twice, thereby causing hurt to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 read with Section 74A of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.”

2       Sections 323 and 74A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and state, _inter alia_, as follows

> “323. Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 334, voluntarily causes hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

> 74A(2).    The court may sentence the offender to punishment not exceeding twice the maximum punishment that the court could, but for this section, impose for the offence, if at the time of committing the offence the offender knew or ought reasonably to have known that the victim was a vulnerable person.

4       The prosecution’s case is as follows:

> (a)     The victim is one Chong Yoke Sin @ Wong Yong Fatt (“V”), a 64-year-old man who is fully blind. He shared a rental flat with the AP. Their relationship turned sour sometime in March 2020, when a police report was filed by V against the AP for abusing him. The AP was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment arising from the police report[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

> (b)     On the fateful day of 8 August 2021, when the AP wanted to go fishing, and was preparing a sandwich in the kitchen, V displayed frustration with some noise in the kitchen by shouting. Out of anger and thinking that V purposely shouted to hinder his fishing trip, the AP charged towards V who was lying on the bed listening to his radio and punched him once on his right side of the face, near his temple. When V took evasive action and turned his head to the left, the AP went over to the left side of the bed and landed another punch to V’s left side of the face, at his left temple near his left eye.

> (c)     The undisputed facts are as follows:

>> (i)       The AP whom V refers to as “Andrew” have been housemates for more than four years and about six years. V is fully blind in both eyes and partially deaf of which the AP is aware. He and V are housemates. On 8 August 2021 at about 6.00pm, both V and the AP were living at Blk 326A Sumang Walk #XXX Singapore 821326 (the “**Flat**”). V was laying on the bed listening to his radio. The AP was in the kitchen, which is about 10 steps away from V’s bed, which is in the living room. The AP was in the kitchen preparing food for a fishing trip. V shouted from the bed. The AP then came over to V’s bed from the right side of V’s bed, which is a narrow passage, and an altercation ensued.

>> (ii)       After the altercation, V took his walking stick and left the Flat. He was walking fast with a walking stick towards the lift lobby. He took the lift down to the first floor where he met PW2. At some point, the police arrived and attended to V. The responding police officers placed the AP under arrest. V was conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital (“**SGH**”) where he was attended to by PW7 at about 7.19 pm. On examination, V was found to have tenderness over the left maxilla and left ophthalmic area and abrasion over the left orbit. V was admitted to the Extended Diagnostic and Treatment Unit for observation and also underwent a CT scan. V was discharged on 9 August 2021 and issued with four days of hospitalisation leave and routine medication.

>> (iii)       V was a vulnerable person by reason of his physical disability, being his visual impairment and the AP knew of this. The injuries suffered by V are as stated in PE1 and PE2. The contents in PE6, PE7 and PE8 are accurate. V was issued with a medical certificate in PE10.

> (d)     The prosecution would, at the trial, seek to prove the following facts in respect of the charge preferred against the AP:

>> (i)       The AP had punched V.

>> (ii)       The contact was at V’s left temple near the left eye and not on his forehead.

>> (iii)       The AP intended to cause hurt or knew that it was likely that he would cause hurt to V.

>> (iv)       The AP ’s act of punching V caused the injuries suffered by V, and the aforesaid injuries were not already present on V.

## CLOSE OF THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

5       At the close of the prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that there was some evidence not inherently incredible which satisfied each and every element of the charge preferred against the AP. Accordingly, I administered the standard allocution to the AP who elected to give evidence in his own defence.

## ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION

6       After consideration of the submissions of both parties, I have decided on the issues for my determination as follows:

> **_Issue (1): Whether the victim, PW1, is a credible and truthful witness ?_**

> (a)     I accepted the prosecution submission that V is a credible and truthful witness for the following reasons as stated by the prosecution:

>> (i)       V’s demeanour throughout the proceedings was forthcoming and candid. There were times when he agreed with the AP. For example, V agreed with the AP that he gave Sunshine bread to him every morning and that he was loud when he said “Oh, oh!”.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) He also agreed with the AP that he assisted him to tune his radio to 99.5.[^3]

>> (ii)       V’s account at trial was internally consistent on the material aspects of the charge. During examination in chief, V gave a compelling, consistent and clear account of the events. He testified that at about 6.00 pm, the AP was cooking, and he was listening to the radio. He heard thumping sounds on the sink and then shouted twice “Oh, oh”. The radio was on low volume. Because the noise sounded like knocking with some object, he thought that the AP was doing it on purpose. Other than shouting twice, he did not say anything else. Thereafter, the AP came over and hit him first on the right-side temple region. Then he felt pain and moved towards the left side. The AP then came over to his left side and hit him on the left temple region. The AP used a closed fist to hit the temple close to his eye. V felt giddy and painful. He got up, used a key to open a cabinet to get his wallet and IC, took his walking stick and went out of the Flat. He then took the lift down and met PW2. PW2 noticed some redness on his face and asked him what happened. He said that he was going to call the police. PW2 then assisted in calling the police for him. When the police came, an ambulance was called, and he was brought to SGH. At SGH, he was examined by a doctor for injuries and a scan was done. He was admitted until the next day, 9 August 2021. He was given a piece of paper, but he did not know what it was.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

>> (iii)       During cross-examination, when the AP stated that all he did was to tap V’s head, V immediately rejected the statement and said “No, you did not just tap on my head. You actually hit me.”[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) Similarly, when the AP put to V that V “did not call the police. He will have called from home. So that was a lie”, V disagreed and said “No, the call to the police was made downstairs, not on my bed”.

>> (iv)       V’s account in his police statement was consistent with all material aspects of the charge, being the manner and contact of the attack on his left side of the face. In the aforesaid statement, he implicated the AP who was his housemate as his assailant and stated without a doubt that he was punched on his “left face near the eye area” when the AP came over to the left side of his bed[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6).

>> (v)       V’s account in his statement in D1 as to the details of when and how the attack came about was inconsistent with his evidence at trial. In D1, V stated that incident happened at around 11.00 am when his housemate used something to hit the toilet door and it created a very loud sound. Thereafter, V stated that the AP came over to the left side of the bed first and then he turned around and he went over to the right side of the bed and punched him for the “2nd time at the same area”. In this regard, I agreed with the prosecution that V’s evidence must be viewed in the context of his age and disabilities. V is a 64-year-old man with partial deafness and blindness. It is not entirely implausible for V to have had a lapse in memory, or confusion as to the exact details surrounding the commission of the offence. As V himself put it, “I think I was confused, and also because I’m not able to see”.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

>> (vi)       I agreed with the prosecution that as regards the timing of the incident, it is undisputed that it happened sometime before 6.23pm, at about 6.00pm. Further, there would be no reason for V to lie about the timing of the incident. When asked by the AP as to why the timing states 11.00 am in DS1, V was sure that the incident on 8 August 2021 was at around 6.00pm and not 11.00am.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) The only inference for the difference in timing in D1 is that V was confused. This is supported by V’s explanation that he could have mixed up the incident with another incident that happened in 2020 when he was hit outside the house.[^9] This is not entirely implausible given that PW5 testified that V had visited the Emergency Department in March 2021 because of an assault on the right side of the face.[^10]

>> (vii)       In relation to how the loud sound came about, I agreed with the prosecution that this is irrelevant to the charge and as V was blind, he could not state for certainty where the sound was coming from (i.e. whether it was from the toilet door or the hitting of a sink). The fact remains that V heard a loud sound which sounded like knocking with an object in the kitchen.

>> (viii)       In relation to area of contact, V was consistent in that in D1, he said the 2nd time was at the same area. This could be inferred to mean the temple area near the eye. This is consistent with his evidence at trial as it was at the same area, but on the right temple near his eye. The statement was not specific to state that it was at the 2nd time on the left side of the temple near the eye. In any case, the present charge only pertains to the left side of the temple near the eye and not the right side of the temple near the eye. In this regard, V was consistent that he was hit on the left side of the temple near the eye at least once.

>> (ix)       In relation to manner of attack, the only real inconsistency between D1 and V’s evidence at trial is whether the AP came from the left side of the bed first or the right side of the bed first. I agreed with the prosecution that this sequence, i.e. left first then right, or right first then left, is irrelevant to the charge and is a minor discrepancy that can be attributed to human fallibility or a lapse in recollection. V also testified that he was confused. He testified that “it should be a punch on my right side first, then on my left side. I think I was confused when I told the officer that he punched me on my left side first, then my right side”.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) In this regard, the AP’s own testimony does not dispute that he went to the right side of the bed (narrow passage) which corroborates V’s account at trial that it was the right side of the bed first. What is of cardinal importance is that V was consistent in both his statement and his evidence at trial that the AP did in fact go over to his left side of the bed to hit him on the left temple near his eye.

>> (x)       V’s evidence was also externally consistent on the material aspects of the charge. V recounted his version of events close to the time of the incident to two separate independent witnesses, being PW2 and PW6. PW2 and PW6’s account of what V recounted to them is corroborative of the fact that V maintained his version immediately after the incident on 8 August 2021 when they attended to him, i.e. that he was punched by his housemate. V went further in respect of what he recounted to PW2 and demonstrated with his closed fist that he was hit on both sides of his face, near his temple. Both PW2 and PW6 testified that they noticed some injury on the left side of V’s face. PW2 testified that it was a bruise on the left cheek and a cut near the eye, and PW6 testified that it was redness around the left eye. This is independent and objective evidence of injuries seen on V right after the incident. The medical evidence also supports that the injuries were seen on the left temple and near the left eye. As was held by the High Court in respect of a charge for voluntarily causing hurt, the fact that the medical evidence was based on the complainant’s self-reporting did not undermine the complainant’s evidence as his self-reporting was itself corroborative[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12). In the present case, V told several third parties that he was punched by the AP on the left temple near the eye. This can be treated as corroborative evidence as was held by the High Court in _Chung Wan v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 858</span> at \[50\]_ that subsequent complaints by the complainant (to the doctor leading to the diagnosis of tenderness) may be treated as corroboration provided that the statement implicating the accused person was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence.

>> (xi)       There were also some inconsistencies between what is written in the medical reports (PE1 and PE2) and the evidence that V gave at trial in relation to manner of the attack. Both reports state that V alleged that he was punched twice on his left side of the face/left eye. At trial, however, PW5 and PW6 testified that they did not examine V and referred to the medical notes instead.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) Thus, the evidence in PE1 and PE2 in relation to what V alleged happened should not be given weight. Instead, weight should be placed on PW7’s evidence, as he was V’s examining doctor. In this regard, while PW7 stated that V alleged that the flatmate landed two blows to himself over his left orbit, PW7 candidly accepted that he may have missed out V’s gestures to the right side of his face during examination as it was in an emergency setting.[^14] He further added that when it comes to elderlies, a detailed history is done using a mixture of gestures and words.[^15] This is wholly consistent with V’s evidence at trial that he pointed to both sides of his temple as follows:

>>> “Q    Mr Chong, earlier on, I asked you if you could explain why the medical report states that you were punched twice on the left eye, and you said that, “After I was hit that day, I was feeling giddy, so when I spoke to the doctor.” Can you continue?

>>> A    I think at that time, I did point to the doctor to the left and right side temples. But I think when I spoke, I was confused at that time, and I also cannot remember what I said at the time.[^16]”

>> (xii)       V maintained during examination in chief that he pointed to the two spots (being the left and right temples) to the doctor.[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) Further, V’s explanation that he was confused and giddy at the time and cannot actually remember what he told the doctors is plausible given his age, and the fact that the attack happened just about an hour before he was seen by the doctor. In any case, the inconsistency pertains only to whether there was a blow to the right side of the face and does not in any way undermine V’s consistent evidence that there was a blow to the left side of his face, being the left temple near his eye which is the subject of the charge preferred against the AP.

>> (xiii)       There were some minor inconsistencies in relation to what V testified at trial and what PW2 and PW9 testified at trial. V had stated that when the police came and saw him, they knew it was not the first time they went --- they did not speak to him, but they went straight up for Andrew (ie the AP).[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) While PW8 gave consistent evidence that he did not speak to V[^19], PW9 testified that he attended to and spoke to V.[^20] V had also stated that he did not tell PW2 about how he was hit, but she noticed some redness on his face.[^21] PW2, on the other hand, testified that V said that he was beaten by the AP.[^22]

>> (xiv)       In relation to the inconsistency pertaining to the evidence of V and PW9, I agreed with the prosecution that this can be attributed to V’s lapse in memory. PW9’s evidence was cogent and stated clearly that he was the one who engaged and attended to V. This must be the case as PW9 testified that he was the one who made the decision to call the ambulance. Furthermore, PW9’s evidence is corroborated by PW8, who said that “my partner interviewed” the victim.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) It is likely that when V was referring to “police”, he was referring to PW8, who testified that he attended to the AP when the AP came down the block.[^24] As for the inconsistency in relation to the evidence of V and PW2, there was no real inconsistency as PW2 later clarified that V had demonstrated to her how he was hit.[^25] Further, this can also be attributed to V’s lapse in memory. In this regard, in the case of _Chung Wan v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 858</span>_ where there were some inconsistencies in the evidence of the complainant, the High Court agreed with the District Judge’s view that “while the complainant’s memory was faulty, this did not raise a reasonable doubt on its own as to undermine the prosecution’s case” as even if it might be that the complainant sought to embellish his version of events, the core of his testimony regarding the slap was sound and corroborated.

>> (xv)       In dealing with the above inconsistencies in relation to V’s evidence and that of other prosecution witnesses, I bore in mind that minor inconsistencies in a witness’ testimony could be disregarded if his testimony was substantially consistent and the minute details that varied did not discredit the witness, and there is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must either be believed in its entirety or not at all. A court is fully competent to accept one part of the witness’ testimony and to reject the other[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) and is not obliged, as a matter of course, to dismiss the credibility of the witness and reject his entire testimony out of hand, but is perfectly entitled, notwithstanding minor inconsistencies, to hold that a particular witness is in fact a witness of truth and to accept the other aspects of his testimony which are untainted by discrepancies.[^27]

>> (xvi)       In the present case, the AP did not once put to V that by reason of the inconsistencies in D1, V was lying in his evidence at trial as V has no reason to lie or falsely incriminate the AP[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28). I took the view that the inconsistencies of the evidence of V and other prosecution witnesses are not of such nature as to impair the strength of the prosecution’s case and V’s evidence regarding that there was a blow to the left side of his face, being the left temple near his eye which is the subject of the charge preferred against the AP, was sound and corroborated.

>> (xvii)       In this regard, I rejected the AP’s contention that V’s account of the incident is inconsistent and do not add up and should not be accepted by this Court. I accepted the prosecution submission that the AP‘s claim that V is not a credible and truthful witness is untenable. While there are discrepancies between V’s testimony in Court and his police statement as well as what V had recounted to PW7, there are reasonable and innocent explanations for the discrepancies which do not necessarily mean that V is a dishonest and untrustworthy witness out to embellish and frame the AP. V had given perfectly reasonable and commonsensical explanations for the discrepancies as follows:

>>> (1)       When asked why he had stated in his police statement that he was hit on the left temple near the left eye twice, V stated that he meant to tell the officer that he was “punched twice”[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) and that he was “confused when I told the officer that he punched me on my left side first, then my right side”[^30].

>>> (2)       When asked why he told PW7 that he was punched twice on the left eye, the accused person said “I meant to say left side once”[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) and that he did “point to the two spots to the doctor”[^32].

>> (xviii)       I accepted the prosecution submission that both versions of V’s testimonies ultimately incriminate the AP as having punched him. If V was a dishonest witness out to embellish his evidence to frame the AP, it makes no sense that he would recount in court a version that incriminates the AP to a lesser extent (twice on same area, as opposed to once on each side). Clearly, it would have been in V’s interest, if he truly wanted to frame the AP, to stick to the account he had given in his police statement, i.e., that he was punched twice by the AP at the same area. Instead, V chose to speak the truth that he was punched on each side once. His testimony in Court should be preferred. V’s change in evidence is an innocent one of confusion and misunderstanding, exacerbated by his blindness. There is nothing malicious or insidious about the discrepancies. There is no reason why this Court should not accept V’s account in court.

> (b)     I have also considered and found no merit in the AP’s submissions on the following issues for the reasons below:

>> (i)       Contrary to the AP’s submissions, the fact that V is visually impaired (fully blind to be exact) does not mean that he is unable to describe to the police officer the whole incident (in full details) about the AP moving to the right and left of his bed (as mentioned in his statement) to hit him. V’s blindness does not impair his ability to sense his surroundings familiar to him and described them as such to the police officer. The AP never put his case to V during cross examination for V’s explanation. An article on “How Do Blind and Visually Impaired People Get Around?”[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) stated as follows:

>>> “**Being blind or visually impaired doesn’t mean you automatically lose the independence of getting to and from places whenever you please.** Several techniques and methods can help people get around safely regardless of their amount of vision…..

>>> **When in familiar places, visually impaired people generally know the layout and memorize where things are**. Learning to travel in different or unfamiliar places is done by using orientation and mobility (O&M) skills**. Orientation is the actual planning of how to get to and from places. Blind and visually impaired people use other senses – like sound, touch and smell – to orient ourselves to their surroundings**. So, if I am walking outside and know there is a school nearby, then I can assume that it is near when I hear children playing and laughing. Likewise, the smell of freshly baked bread and cookies tells me I am near a bakery.

>>> **Memory is also important when traveling as a person without vision.** We memorize important street names, locations, etc. Contrary to common belief, we do not count our steps! **Those with low vision may use their other senses along with their remaining vision to get around**.” (emphasis mine)

>> (ii)       As I found the AP not to be a credible and truthful witness but found the V to be such a witness, I accepted V’s evidence that the AP’s fist was clenched when he hit V as a blind man like V can still sense what touched and hit him and described it as such, and is not just based on his thoughts or beliefs on how the incident actually turned out, as contended by the AP. The AP never put his case to V during cross examination for V’s explanation. An article on “Visually-impaired touch”[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) stated as follows:

>>> “**Blind individuals rely on their sense of touch for pattern perception**, much as the rest of us depend on vision…

>>> ….The age of onset of blindness has implications for how well people use their sense of touch. For example, if people are Congenitally Blind (CB), that is, born without sight or lose it soon after birth, they will not benefit from visual experience or visual imagery. However, they may have an advantage conveyed by their education in mobility skills. **People who lose sight later on in life, the Late Blind (LB) or adventitiously blind, retain the influence of visual experience and are likely to retain memory of visual imagery. Low vision may increase reliance on the sense of touch, but sight of the hand and crude large object perception may aid mobility and touch perception….**

>>> **Many studies demonstrate advantages in pattern perception in the late blind and the beneficial role of visual experience and imagery**, but this is context dependent. If a task involves reading Braille, one might expect that age of onset matters, with much later onset of blindness a negative predictor of skill. If tasks involve situations that control for differential familiarity, one may see comparable or lower performance by CB and sighted individuals compared to the LB, when using their sense of touch. **Late blind persons may have the combined benefits of haptic and visual experience.** Again, there are large individual differences and the effects of visual experience can be negative, when one is blinded very late in life. Under typical circumstances in the sighted, vision is used to guide touch, but this advantage is lacking in the totally blind, or blindfolded individual. **Blind participants tend to be much faster than blindfolded sighted individuals using their touch for pattern perception**.” (emphasis mine)

>> (iii)       In this regard, I rejected the AP’s submission and agreed with the prosecution that V, being visually impaired, would not have been able to see whether a closed fist was used. This point was not put by the AP to V during cross-examination at all. At no point during the trial did the AP confront V with this. V was therefore not given any opportunity to respond to this allegation. This was simply not the AP’s case which was instead a bare denial. The aforesaid allegation is clearly an afterthought, conveniently concocted by the AP to buttress his case. In any event, even though V was blind and not able to see how he was hit, his other senses were not impaired. Probative weight should be placed on V’s evidence that he could feel how he was hit. In terms of sensory impact, V is clearly able to differentiate between a punch and a slap. In fact, V said that “if it was his open palm, it wouldn’t be so painful”[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35). When confronted by the AP that “I just tapped his head”, V said “No, you did not just tap on my head. You actually hit me”. Furthermore, it is axiomatic that if a person is punched, he would feel a fist. If a person is tapped, he would have felt fingers. The difference between a punch and a tap would be obvious to any reasonable person, and any reasonable person would be able to feel the impact of a closed fist as opposed to the impact of a tap. A fist would invariably feel harder and more forceful than the use of fingers. This is precisely why V testified at trial that he thought that it was a fist because it was “so painful”[^36]. Moreover, while the AP has every reason to downplay his act of violence on V, V has no reason to embellish this. It was not the AP’s case at trial that V harboured any grudge or anger towards him or that V was being dishonest in his testimonies. When V was asked if he had any reason to falsely implicate the AP, he said no[^37]. This was unchallenged by the AP.V ’s behaviour post-incident (which is undisputed by the AP in material aspects) supports the conclusion that V was punched rather than tapped. The AP admitted that V was effectively “running away” from the flat. Furthermore, PW2 gave evidence that V was “actually shivering” and was “desperately asking for help”[^38]. There would also be no reason for V to have felt “giddy” and “painful” after the “tap” if it had been gentle and not forceful[^39]. This fact that V felt giddy and painful was unchallenged by the AP at trial. PW7 also corroborates that V complained of giddiness after he was punched but that the giddiness had resolved[^40].

>> (iv)       As regards the AP’s submission that V would not have been able to see if he had moved to the right or left of V’s bed, it is implicit in this submission that V is not able to differentiate between the right and left side. I agreed with the prosecution that to this end, if this were truly the AP ’s case, he should have confronted V with this. This was not done. During trial, V was able to clearly tell the Court that he was hit on the right first, and then the left. He rightly pointed to the right first, and then the left. He was able to tell the Court that his bed is situated on the “right side of the main door” and that the “kitchen will be just after the living room…about 10 steps” away[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41). Further, the fact that the AP first came to his right (i.e. a narrow passage next to the bed) was accepted by the AP at trial[^42]. In addition, V told the Court that after the incident, he used a key to open a cabinet to get his wallet and he also retrieved his walking stick[^43]. Clearly, V was well orientated to the space in the unit. Further, by the AP’s own evidence, i.e. that V was sitting up and facing the right wall when the AP approached him and V was aware what was going on around him. When asked how V was able to know that he was approaching, the AP said “By hearing the voice, he knows”[^44]. Similarly, V would have been able to hear the AP’s movements. Moreover, V’s ability to feel pain and contact on his body has not been doubted. When asked where he felt the pain, V said “on the sides of my head where he hit me, the left --- sorry, the right first and then the left”. When asked if he was hit on the forehead, V said “no, no, the sides, not the forehead”.[^45] V’s evidence as to where he felt the point of contact (i.e. each side of his head) must be given full weight.

>> (v)       As for the AP’s submissions that V’s statement in D1 and V’s testimony in Court was inconsistent in respect of the events preceding the attack, in particular that V was inconsistent as to whether he was hit on the right temple near the right eye first, or whether he was hit on left temple near the left eye twice, I accepted the prosecution submissions that these inconsistencies relate to the sequence of events preceding the material act and are immaterial to the charge as what is material is that V’s testimony in Court was unshaken and consistent that he was punched at least once on the left eye near the left temple.

> **_Issue (2): Whether each of the prosecution witnesses, PW2 to PW9, is a credible and truthful witness ?_**

> (a)     I accepted the prosecution submissions that PW2 to PW9 are credible, truthful and independent witnesses. These witnesses were internally consistent and externally consistent on all material elements of the charge. The AP is unable to proffer any reason as to why they might have been motivated to lie. Their evidence at trial in relation to the material aspects was unchallenged by the AP:

>> (i)       PW2: The AP challenged her evidence that she called the police. He told PW2 that the police were already there before V came down the block.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) I rejected the AP’s submissions that PW2 is not credible based on the injuries that she had reported seeing for the following reasons as submitted by the prosecution:

>>> (1)       PW2, being a neutral and uninterested party, has no reason to embellish her evidence as to what was relayed to her by V, and what injuries she observed on him.

>>> (2)       PW2 is not medically trained and is a lay witness. She can only describe the injuries she observed based on her recollection of what she saw in layman terms. In relation to her observation of a bruise, PW2 said that she “saw a bruise on the left cheek, blue-black”. While PW2 clearly saw an injury on V, she could be mistaken as to the exact nature and description of the injury. What is important is that PW2 saw some injury on V’s left cheek which was consistent with V’s claim that he was hit by the AP on the left temple near the left eye. This is also consistent with PW5’s evidence that V had “pain over the left cheek, and then the left temple”[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47).

>>> (3)       In fact, V corroborates PW2’s evidence that she saw some injury to his face. He said, “After I got downstairs, this Malay neighbour who knows Andrew as well noticed --- who’s a friend of Andrew noticed that there was some redness on my head --- sorry, on my face”. He repeated this when he said, “I did not tell her, but she noticed some redness on my face”[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48).

>>> (4)       In relation to the cut to the eye, this is consistent with PW7’s evidence that he noticed an abrasion at the medial to left orbit which means under the eye[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49). PW5 clarified that an abrasion means a “superficial wound”[^50]. PW7 also clarified that it is similar to an “area of redness…and some skin flakes around the area”[^51]. While a cut and an abrasion is not stricto senso the same, given that PW2 is not medically trained, this is not a material inconsistency. Importantly, a superficial wound/redness/skin flakes would be visible to the eye and easily observable by PW2.

>>> (5)       In relation to the cut on the lip, this is not relevant to the charge. In any case, it is plausible for PW7 to have missed out the documentation of some of the injuries during the setting of an emergency ward. PW7 gave evidence that “In the Emergency setting where it’s sometimes quite hurried, and yes, it’s possible, miss out certain things”[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52).

>>> (6)       Further, nothing was put to PW2 during trial that she was being untruthful or dishonest. The AP did not confront PW2 with the medical evidence (i.e., the lack of a bruise being documented) for PW2 to respond to it. The AP’s submission that the injuries as observed by PW2 do not add up to the victim’s version of the story is not true.V’s evidence that the AP punched him once on the left temple near the left eye is consistent with PW2’s observation of the location of the injuries – on the left cheek and on the eye. As stated by the AP himself in his submissions, had he punched V, the injuries would have been “bruising or maybe even cuts”[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53).

>> (ii)       PW3: The AP did not cross-examine the investigation officer at all.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54)

>> (iii)       PW4: The AP did not cross-examine the social worker at all.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55)

>> (iv)       PW5: The AP raised that V has sores on the whole head. PW5 responded that she was not the examining doctor and the AP had no further questions for her.94

>> (v)       PW6: The AP raised that V has sores on his whole head. PW6 responded that he did not see V in person and the AP had no further questions for him.[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56)

>> (vi)       As submitted by the prosecution, the AP had conceded that PW5 and PW6 were truthful witnesses. He erroneously stated that PW5 and PW6 “both raised that PW1 had sores on his whole head”[\[note: 57\]](#Ftn_57). This is a misrepresentation of what happened. When PW5 was confronted by the AP that V “has a sore for almost 6 years, up to the neck”, PW5 candidly stated that she did not examine the patient personally[^58]. When PW6 was confronted with the allegation that V has serious sores on the whole head, PW6 stated “actually, I didn’t see him in person…I did record based on the documentation on the days he’s seen”[^59]. They did not at any point raise or agree with the AP’s contention that V had sores on his whole head.

>> (vii)       PW7: The AP raised that V has sores all over his body and head. PW7 responded that it is less likely that the injuries happened by themselves without anyone touching him. The AP had no further questions for him.[\[note: 60\]](#Ftn_60) I accepted the prosecution submission that the AP does not dispute that PW7’s evidence was credible and truthful. The injuries observed on V were on the left eye area which contradicts the AP’s evidence that the tap was on the forehead. By accepting that PW7 was credible and truthful, the AP has accepted that the victim suffered injuries on his left eye area near the temple.

>> (vii)       PW8: The AP cross-examined PW8 on whether he was carrying fishing equipment at the point of his arrest.[\[note: 61\]](#Ftn_61)

>> (viii)       PW9: The AP cross-examined PW9 that he was not handcuffed and that he was with the victim when the police arrived.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62)

>> (ix)       I agreed with the prosecution submissions that the AP’s claim that he was not handcuffed during his arrest and that any available CCTV footage at the HDB lift landing and at the police station would have captured the footage is irrelevant to the charge.

> (b)     As can be seen from the above, other than for PW7, the AP did not cross-examine any of the prosecution witnesses on any material aspects relating to the charge. The only inference is that it is not the AP’s case that these witnesses are not credible or truthful witnesses and the AP had further confirmed that he was not stating that the police officers were lying as follows:

>> Q    So according to you, the police officers who saw you with fishing equipment are lying, lah

>> A    I don’t say they are lying. I did not say. They didn’t even mention that they talk to the Malay couple first. They mention they talk. So I didn’t even bo---have a chance to question them on such thing. I not say they are lying. Because the---this is a problem. It’s serious enough. Where got time to think of fishing already?[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63)

> (c)     I have considered and found no merit in the AP’s submissions on this issue for the following reasons:

>> (i)       While the AP accepted that PW2 had received the information directly from V and so it is only fair she explained or demonstrated to the court in the manner that V had put it to her, I rejected the AP’s contention that PW2's evidence is not credible based on the injuries that she reported seeing (bruise on V's left cheek, small cut on the eye and up) which does not add up to PW1's version of story and the medical reports provided as I have accepted V’s story and the medical evidence as proof of such injuries.

>> (ii)       As all three doctors, being PW5, PW6 and PW7 stated that the injuries as seen on V is consistent with him being punched and their evidence was not challenged by the AP during his cross-examination, I rejected the AP’s contention that their evidence were not truthful or credible based on how they carried out their examination of and report on V.

>> (iii)       While the AP is correct that the evidence provided by PW2 to PW9 is largely based on V’s version of story and how he relayed the incident to them, this does not render their evidence unacceptable, as the High Court had held in _Haliffie bin Mamat v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[30\] and \[66\]_ that in respect of a charge for voluntarily causing hurt, the fact that the medical evidence was based on the complainant’s self-reporting did not undermine the complainant’s evidence and his self-reporting was itself corroborative. Further, subsequent complaints by the complainant (to the doctor leading to the diagnosis of tenderness) may be treated as corroboration provided that the statement implicating the accused person was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence, as was held by the High Court in _Chung Wan v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 858</span> at \[50\]._ In our present case, V’s self-reporting statements implicating the AP were made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence to the doctors and other prosecution witnesses and are similarly acceptable as corroborative evidence.

> **_Issue (3): Whether the AP is a credible and truthful witness?_**

> (a)     I agreed with the prosecution submissions that the AP is not a credible and truthful witness and his evidence should not be accepted for reasons as advocated by the prosecution as follows:

>> (i)       The AP’s vacillating versions at trial, and different version in his statement speaks of his lack of credibility. During evidence-in-chief, the AP stated that he prodded V’s head. He repeated that everything happened fast but that he did not punch V.[\[note: 64\]](#Ftn_64) During cross-examination, however, the AP proffered three different versions of what happened:

>>> (1)       He walked over to V and used his left hand to slap V’s forehead. There was only one slap to the forehead.[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65)

>>> (2)       He did not slap V’s forehead. He tapped the forehead with his fingers.[\[note: 66\]](#Ftn_66)

>>> (3)       There were two taps on the forehead both with the left hand using the left to right motion. Other than these incidents, there were no other incidents of him hitting V.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)

>> (ii)       The AP’s three versions are inconsistent with his police statement in PE5 which he did not challenge its admissibility or accuracy at any point during the trial and wherein he stated that there was one prod on V’s forehead, followed by a slap on the forehead once and then he “hit him for a second time on his forehead”. Read with A3 in PE5, there was one prod on V’s forehead, and two slaps on V’s forehead. In total, according to the AP’s version in PE5, there were three instances where the AP hit V on his forehead. .

>> (iii)       When confronted with these inconsistencies in his police statement in PE5, the AP changed his version during cross-examination yet again and accepted that there were three instances, but he was only thinking about “the two serious one \[sic\]”.[\[note: 68\]](#Ftn_68) He further added that he was thinking of the “one that you all take it as slapping him on the forehead”. By saying that, the AP accepted that there were two instances in which he slapped V on the forehead. However, he changed his version yet again and said that “main permanent thing is about the two tapping on the forehead so that is the one that is counted for. So, the prodding is just I just making a statement”.[^69] Once again, the AP reverted to his third version, being that there were two tapping incidents on the forehead, and one prodding incident.

>> (iv)       From the AP’s vacillating versions of what happened, it is clear that the AP cannot keep his story straight. He was not able to state with certainty and consistency whether it was a tap, a prod, or a slap. In fact, the AP admitted that “I don’t know how they interpret as a punch, slap or --- or tap. So I leave it for whoever investigate to decide”.[\[note: 70\]](#Ftn_70)

>> (v)       When confronted with his statement, the AP’s credibility was impeached when he gave a fourth version of events - being that there was one prod to the forehead and subsequently two slaps to the forehead. This was despite the fact that throughout the cross-examination, the AP was specifically asked if anything else happened and maintained that it was not a slap :

>>> Q    And you testified during your evidence-in-chief that you went over to his bed and slapped him, and you said, “You are in your comfort zone.” Is that correct?

>>> A    I didn’t slap. I tap the forehead. If --- I don’t know how they interpret it as a punch, slap or --- tap. So I leave it for whoever investigate to decide.

>>> Q    So you did not slap but you tap the forehead, is it?

>>> A    Yes.

>>> …

>>> Q    And other than this tapping of the forehead once with your four fingers and saying “Where is your brain?, did you hit Mr Chong?

>>> A    No. It was a second time again on the forehead.

>>> \---

>>> Q    So other than for these two times, were there any other incidents of you hitting him?

>>> A    No, I walk away. I move away.[\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71)

>> (vi)       The AP also testified that other than a slap to the forehead, nothing else happened between him and V as follows:

>>> “Q    Pause there. Okay. So you are saying that other than the slap to the forehead, nothing else happened between you and the victim. Is it?

>>> A    Nothing.

>>> Q    Did you mean that there was only one slap to the forehead? Correct?

>>> A    Yes. “[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72)

>> (vii)       The AP was not able to state with certainty and consistency how many times he hit V. In respect to the amount of force that was used, the AP was also inconsistent in his evidence. When asked if he would describe his slap as forceful, the AP stated that it was “not gentle but not forceful”.[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73) He demonstrated to the Court the strength of the slap. When the DPP put to him that it appears forceful, he readily agreed with the DPP.[^74] Subsequently, the AP said that he did not use much strength and that he “know(s) how to exert the right amount of strength”. When confronted with the fact that he had agreed with the DPP earlier that it was forceful, the AP said, “if you were to ask me, I say it was --- to me, that is not forceful”.[^75]

>> (viii)       The AP had sought to attribute his different versions to semantics and a matter of interpretation which I have rejected as the AP had made it clear at trial that he was being careful of what he was saying at trial because it would be used against him. There is therefore no reason for the AP to have used interchangeable or loose terms to describe exactly what he did – particularly when he made it a point to correct the use of the word “slap” to “tap”.

>> (ix)       The AP’s explanation as to how the two taps happened was that it happened continuously. He said “I tap him, after that he answer me, again I tap him, “Use your brain and --- and do things”.103 He subsequently contradicted himself:

>>> Q    What do you mean that if you do not answer me with the right answer, it may sound ---

>>> A    Because there was the interval.

>>> Q    Like I’m guilty?

>>> A    The second slap came --- tap on the forehead was when he used the police to provoke me. So it’s not something that happen all within few second. Everything happens.

>>> …

>>> Q    So there was an interval of the tap, therefore you told me that there was only one tap, is it?

>>> A    Yes.

>>> Q    I put it to you that you’re not being truthful on the stand. Agree or disagree?

>>> A    Disagreed.[\[note: 76\]](#Ftn_76)

>> (x)       The AP’s version was that the interval between the two slaps was due to V using the police to provoke him. However, the AP’s version shifted yet again when he said that actually, in between the first tap and the second tap, a neighbour had intervened and told him not to “not to touch” V. It was only after the neighbour left that he gave the second tap to V.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) The AP was also inconsistent as to whether the neighbour saw him hit V. First, the AP stated that the neighbour did not see him give the first tap on V’s forehead. Subsequently, the AP stated, “the neighbour witness \[sic\] the first incident so he saw that he was punched but I don’t take the tapping as a punch or assault”. When asked to clarify if he was saying that the neighbour witnessed the first incident being him tapping the victim on the forehead, he said “yes” immediately followed by a “no, no”.[^78]

>> (xi)       The AP’s lies are brought to the fore when his evidence is looked at in its entirety:

>>> (1)       As regards his relationship with V, the AP lied to the Court that he was on good terms with V as at 8 August 2021 as he subsequently conceded that he was estranged from V as follows:

>>>> Q    But, Mr Ng, your relationship with him as of 8th August 2021 was already estranged. Right? Was already not on good terms. Correct?

>>>> A    Not really, Your Honour. We still eat together, I still buy food, he still request me favour. So I will say it’s --- it’s a normal relationship.[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79)

>>>> …

>>>> Q    Do you agree with me that it is not on good terms?

>>>> A    Not on good terms --- not from me. It’s from him, maybe.[^80]

>>>> \---

>>>> Q    Would you say that your relationship with \[V\] was on good terms after the incident?

>>>> A    Yes, it was on good terms.[^81]

>>>> \---

>>>> Q    In fact, \[V\] and you were not on good terms at this point in time. He had already made a police report against you for hitting him. You were also advised not to hit him anymore. Correct?

>>>> A    Yes.[^82]

>>>> \---

>>>> Q    Would you not agree with me that your relationship with him was estranged as of 8th August 2021?

>>>> A    Yes, it does get worse. After --- if I try not to talk to him, it does get worse.[^83]

>>> (2)       The AP lied to the Court that he did not have anger management issues[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84) when he later conceded that he needed counselling for his anger management.[^85] He also lied to the Court that he did not have any issues with V’s daily habits as he subsequently conceded that he found V’s listening to the radio every day as annoying and irritating.[^86]

>>> (3)       The AP lied to the Court that he had lowered his tone to speak to V during the altercation.[\[note: 87\]](#Ftn_87) In fact, he admitted that it was inconsistent with his earlier version that both he and V were shouting at each other and that he had raised his voice.[^88]

>>>> Q    How did you try?

>>>> A    I spoke to him. I try to change and lower my tone. I used to change my tone.

>>>> Q    So you’re saying that after speaking to him and asking why he behaved this way, you then changed your tone. And after he answered you rudely, you tried to change your tone and ask him the same question again?

>>>> A    I always change my tone when talk to him.

>>>> Q    I’m talking about the 8th August 2021.

>>>> A    Yes, I change.[^89]

>>> (4)       The AP lied to the Court that after the altercation, everything had cooled down[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90) and he subsequently admitted to the Court that it had not in fact calmed down.

>>>> Q    Earlier on, you said that when everything calm(ed) down then he left and you followed him. Now you are saying that if the problem is serious enough, where got think of fishing? Which is it? Was it calmed down, or was the problem so serious that ---

>>>> A    No, we haven’t calm down.[^91]

>> (xii)       The AP’s story that V was sitting up when he tapped his forehead twice and did not move away once – is entirely unbelievable given that it is natural human response to take evasive action if one is struck. Furthermore, it is implausible when seen in the proper context – that both V and the AP were not on good terms. V would most certainly not have sat there and allowed the AP to prod his forehead once, and then slap his forehead three times without flinching or moving away. What is more logical is that V was taken completely off-guard when the AP charged at him as he was lying down and punched him on the right-side of his face at the temple near his eye first. V immediately turned his head to the other side, exposing his left side of the face. The AP then went over to the left side of the bed and punched V on the left side of the face, at the left temple near the left eye. V then immediately got up from the bed and left the Flat hurriedly.

>> (xiii)       The AP’s evidence is not externally consistent with the injuries as documented by the doctors (PW5 to PW7) who had stated that the injuries as seen on V is consistent with him being punched, as opposed to merely tapped as follows:

>>> PW5

>>> Q    Are the injuries consistent with Mr Chong being punched at the left temple near the eye at least once?

>>> A    Yes.[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92)

>>> PW6

>>> Q    Is left eye pain and abrasion consistent with being punched in the left temple near the left eye at least once?

>>> A    Yes.[^93]

>>> PW7

>>> Q    Would it be consistent with being punched on the left temple

>>> near the left eye ---

>>> A    That ---

>>> Q    --- at least once?

>>> A    --- that’s also possible.[^94]

>> (xiv)       The AP ’s evidence is also not externally consistent with the evidence of PW2 and PW9. PW2’s testimony[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95) when taken together unambiguously supports V’s version that he was hit on the left temple region as not only did PW2 herself see a bruise on V’s left cheek and a small cut on the eye, but she also saw V point to the left temple with his fist. PW9’s evidence[^96] that in respect of V’s injuries, he noted down that there was some redness on the left eye area on V at the material time which further corroborates that the fact that V was hit at that area. The AP ’s testimony that he did not bring his fishing equipment down is also inconsistent with PW8’s evidence[^97] in Court. I noted that the AP made no submissions on this issue of whether he himself is a credible and truthful witness as he had stated that:” I have shared my opinion and side of the story and leave the rest for the court to decide.”[^98]

> **_Issue (4): Whether the prosecution has established its case against the AP beyond a reasonable doubt ?_**

> (a)     As the charge faced by the AP is one of voluntarily causing hurt to a vulnerable person under s 323 read with s 74A(2) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**PC**”), the elements of the charge are:

>> (i)       the AP punched V’s left temple near the left eye at least once;

>> (ii)       the AP did so with the intention to cause hurt or knowing it to be likely that he would thereby cause hurt to V ;

>> (iii)       the AP thereby caused V to sustain a superficial abrasion wound over the left eye area measuring 0.5cm and tenderness over left maxilla and left frontal bone area;

>> (iv)       V was a vulnerable person by reason of his physical disability, being his visual impairment; and

>> (vi)       the AP knew that V was a vulnerable person.

> (b)     It is undisputed that V was a vulnerable person by reason of his physical disability, being his visual impairment and the AP knew of this, as acknowledged by the AP in his submissions[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99). The injuries suffered by V are as stated in PE1 and PE2. The contents in PE6, PE7 and PE8 are accurate. V was issued with a medical certificate in PE10. However, the prosecution would need to address the following issues which are the disputed material facts.

> _Whether the AP punched or tapped V?_

> (c)     I agreed with the prosecution submissions that the AP had punched V’s left temple near the left eye at least once and it was a punch and not a tap as alleged by the AP for reasons as submitted by the prosecution as follows:

>> (i)       V consistently maintained both in his police statement and his evidence at trial that the AP punched him. In his police statement in D1, at \[3\], V stated:

>>> Subsequently, he came over to the left side of my bed and **punch** \[sic\] me on my left face near the eye area. I turn around and he went over to the right side of my bed and **punch** \[sic\] me for the 2nd time at the same area. **\[Emphasis** added\]

>> (ii)       At trial, V demonstrated to the Court that the AP used a closed fist to hit his left temple region. He testified as follows:

>>> Q    And then you said that he came over and he hit over. Can you explain to the Court how he came over and how he hit you?

>>> A    So the---he--when he came over, he hit me first on my right temple region. Then I felt pain and I moved towards the left side. He then came over to my left side and then he hit me on my left temple region.

>>> Q    Just now, you demonstrated to the Court how he hit you. And is it correct for me to say that he used a closed fist to hit the temple close to your eye?

>>> A    I think it was a fist, because I think if it was his open palm, it wouldn’t be so painful.

>>> Q    And would you describe that as a punch?

>>> A    Yes, I would call that a punch.[\[note: 100\]](#Ftn_100)

>> (iii)       V told PW2 that he was punched close in proximity to the time of the incident. PW2 testified that when she saw V at the void deck, V told her that the AP punched him:

>>> Q    Now, Mdm Nur, can you tell the Court what happened on 8th August 2021 which led you to call the police?

>>> A    …Then he said that Uncle Ng which is Mr Ng – we call him Uncle Bird – he actually --- he say that he beat him, like, punch him like that, yah.

>>> …

>>> Q    So earlier on, you demonstrated to the Court what Mr Chong showed you Mr Ng did to him.

>>> A    Yes, correct.

>>> Q    Can you repeat the demonstration for the Court?

>>> A    Uncle was holding the phone like that, then he say, like punch, yah, both left and right like that.

>>> Q    So would it be accurate to say that he pointed to his left temple and right temple with his fist?

>>> A    Yah, correct.[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101)

>> (iv)       V also told PW7, who was the attending doctor at SGH, that “his flatmate landed two blows to himself”.[\[note: 102\]](#Ftn_102) This is encapsulated in PE2, being the medical report prepared by Dr Garcia, Anna Marie (PW5), which stated at \[2\] that “According to the patient, on 8th August 2021, his flat mate punched him over the left side of the face twice”. PW5 testified that she referred to PE6, PE7 and PE8 in the preparation of her report.[^103] From PE6, which is the A&E Patient Case Record dated 25th April 2022, it is clear that at the point of triage, V’s chief complaint was that his “left eye get punched twice”. The word “punch” is seen repeated in PE6, PE7 and PE8 even when V was seen by different persons, being Dr Stanley Low Yi Xian in the EDTU (as seen from PE7) and the physiotherapist Seow Chuanyuan (as seen from PE8). In addition, the medical evidence supports the fact that V was punched, as opposed to merely tapped. All three doctors, being PW5, PW6 and PW7 stated that the injuries as seen on V is consistent with him being punched. PW7 testified that some degree of abrasion is expected for someone on the receiving end of the punch due to the element of friction.[^104] In addition, PW7 testified that that a gentle tap would be less likely to cause the injuries as seen on V.[^105]

>> (v)       PW9, who was one of the arresting officers that attended to V at the scene, testified that he spoke to V and asked him if he required any immediate medical attention.[\[note: 106\]](#Ftn_106) V replied that he was in pain as he “got punched by the defendant”[^107].

>> (vi)       Although V is blind, his reasoning as to why he thought it was a punch was sound. The AP’s version of a mere tap on the forehead, or a prod, would not be as painful as a punch. Further, V would be able to differentiate a punch from a mere tap as V had been punched before.

>> (vii)       As I have found the AP not to be a credible and truthful witness, I rejected the AP’s evidence that he merely tapped V and did not punch V as the AP’s submissions that “I do agree that physical contact was made but do not agree to them being in the form of punches”[\[note: 108\]](#Ftn_108) as the contact was a tap contradicts his various versions at trial, i.e., that it was a slap on the forehead, and his version in his police statement, i.e., that it was a prod to the forehead. The AP’s deliberate use of the word “tap” at trial and in his submissions sought to downplay and trivialize what he had done to V. Further, the use of the word “tap”, which is defined in the Cambridge English Dictionary as “to hit something gently” is oxymoronic to the AP’s admissions at trial that it was forceful and the admission in his submissions that the “tap” was presumably forceful enough to cause abrasions[^109]. Other than stating that V was tapped on the forehead, the AP did not raise any argument to support his bare allegation that the contact was not on the left temple near the left eye. He has also not raised any evidence to show that injuries were seen or observed on V’s forehead and did not even ask PW7 or PW2 if any redness or injury was seen on V’s forehead. PW7’s evidence that he did not notice any injury to V’s forehead and that if he had, it would have been documented, was unchallenged by the AP. If the AP had truly hit V’s forehead forcefully as he had demonstrated in Court, V’s forehead would undoubtedly have at least some redness or tenderness and PW2 and PW7 would have observed the same on V’s forehead. The AP’s self-serving evidence that the contact was a tap should therefore be outrightly rejected.

>> (viii)       V’s evidence as to the manner of attacks was consistent and wholly reliable. When the AP put to V that he “just tapped his head”, V flatly rejected that and said "no, you did not just tap on my head. You actually hit me”[\[note: 110\]](#Ftn_110). V’s evidence that he was punched was consistent in his police statement in D1, his evidence in trial and what he said to PW2 and PW7. He even demonstrated to PW2 that a closed fist was used to punch him. V did not deviate from this evidence once. There is no reason for V to lie to PW2, the police, PW7 and the Court that he was hit on the left temple near the left eye by the AP if he had truly been hit on the forehead. There is no material difference in terms of egregiousness of an attack on the temple and on the forehead. There is a clear and constant thread that underpins V’s evidence. V’s evidence was therefore unshaken and unwavering and should be believed.

>> (ix)       Accordingly, I found that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the AP had punched V, as opposed to having tapped V.

> _Whether the contact was at V’s left temple near the left eye or on his forehead?_

> (d)     I agreed with the prosecution submissions that the AP had hit V on his left temple near the left eye and not on his forehead for the following reasons as submitted by the prosecution:

>> (i)       V’s evidence that he was hit on the temple near the left eye is corroborated by PW2, PW9, V’s police statement, what V told the doctor at SGH, and medical evidence.

>> (ii)       During evidence in chief, V testified that the AP first came over and hit him on the right temple region. He felt pain and he moved towards the left side. Thereafter, the AP came over to his left side and hit him on the left temple region.[\[note: 111\]](#Ftn_111) When asked where he felt the pain, V said that he felt the pain on the sides of his head where he was hit, being the right first and then the left.[^112] V rejected the proposition that he was hit on his forehead instead and said “no, no, the two sides, not the forehead”.[^113]

>> (iii)       PW2 is an independent and objective witness. PW2 testified that she had been V and the AP’s neighbour for more than three years. In fact, she stated that she referred to the AP as “Uncle Bird” and that it was the AP who told her that V was blind or what to do when her kids were playing outside.[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114) As a neighbour to both V and the AP, and having interacted with the AP, PW2 would have little reason to falsely implicate the AP or fabricate evidence. PW2 had testified that she saw that V was “shivering” and looked like he desperately needed help. She noticed that there was a bruise on V’s left cheek, a small cut on the eye and the lip. PW2 also said that V had pointed to his left temple and right temple with his fist when he was describing how he was punched by the AP.[^115] Additionally, PE3, being the First Information Report corroborates that PW2 noticed that V’s left cheek was red, and that V was afraid. Taken together, PW2’s testimony unambiguously supports V’s version that he was hit on the left temple region. Not only did PW2 herself see a bruise on V’s left cheek and a small cut on the eye, but she also saw V point to the left temple with his fist.

>> (iv)       PW9, a police sergeant, testified that he attended to Block 326A Sumang Walk on 8 August 2021. He met PW2 and subsequently spoke to V. He testified that V recounted that he was in pain. As such, he requested the ambulance to attend to V. He attended to V until the ambulance came. PW9 testified that in respect of injuries, he noted down that there was some redness on the left eye area on V at the material time.[\[note: 116\]](#Ftn_116) The fact that redness on the left eye area was seen by PW9 on V further corroborates that the fact that he was hit at that area.

>> (v)       V’s police statement in D1 is consistent with his testimony at trial insofar as it relates to where the contact of the hit was. In D1 at \[3\], V stated “he came over to the left side of my bed and punch me on my left face near the eye area”. This is consistent with V’s testimony in Court that he was hit on the left temple region, being the left side of his head.

>> (vi)       V had told the SGH doctors as follows. In PE2 at \[2\], it is stated that V said that he was punched over the left side of his face by his flatmate. In PE1 at \[3\], it is stated that V was punched on his left eye by his housemate. In both medical reports, references were made to either the left side of the face, or the left eye. No references were made at any point to the forehead. When PW5 was asked to explain why she described the area of contact as the left side of the face, she clarified that she used the general term “face” as it was unclear whether it was the left eye, the left orbit, or the bony socket.[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117) When PW6 was asked to explain why he described the area of contact as the left eye, he clarified that he was referring to the “general term around that eye area”.[^118] PW7 testified that what V had in fact told him was that the blows landed on his left orbit, which he understood to mean near or around the left eye.[^119] From PE1 and PE2, it is clear that V complained of left eye pain or left retroorbital pain.[^120] PW5 explained in Court that V explained of pain behind the left eye.[^121] It is clear that had V been in fact hit on the forehead and not at the left temple near the left eye, there would have been no reason for V to have had left eye pain. At trial, the AP did not at any point challenge what was stated in PE1 and PE2 or put to the doctors that the area that was hit was actually the forehead, and not the left temple near the left eye.

>> (vii)       The medical evidence stating where the injuries were observed leave no doubt that V was hit at the left temple near the left eye. PE2 states that the injuries were tenderness over the left maxilla and left ophthalmic area and abrasion over the left orbit. PW5 explained that this means that V had pain over the left cheek, abrasion around the left eye and pain over the lateral aspect of the forehead, being the left temple near to the eye. She added that the abrasion was 0.5cm and that V had pain over the left cheek and the left temple.[\[note: 122\]](#Ftn_122) She concluded that the injuries were consistent with V being punched at the left temple near the eye at least once.[^123] PE1 states that the injuries noted were superficial abrasion over left eye area measuring 0.5cm and tenderness over the left maxilla and left frontal bone area. PW6 concluded that the injuries were consistent with V being punched at the left temple near the eye at least once.[^124]

>> (viii)       PW7 testified that he conducted his medical examination by both a visual inspection and palpitation.[\[note: 125\]](#Ftn_125) He noticed that there was an abrasion at the medial to the left orbit, which means below and to the right of the left eye. He further noticed there was pain below the left eyeball, and some pain to the left of the left eye. He concluded that it was consistent with V being hit on the left temple near the left eye.[^126]

>>> Q    Looking at where you observed the injuries, is the location of the injuries consistent with an attack to the left temple area near the eye?

>>> A    Yes, it will be possible.[^127]

>> (ix)       In short, the medical evidence shows that the injuries observed on V were, amongst other places, at the left side of his face, close to his left eye and at the left temple area. The areas where the injuries were observed show that the contact must have been at these locations.

>> (x)       As I have found the AP not to be a credible and truthful witness, I rejected the AP’s evidence that he slapped V ’s forehead twice and prodded it once which is also contradicted by the medical evidence. When PW7 was asked whether he noticed any injury to V’s forehead, he said that he did not and if there was anything significant, he would have recorded it down. Further, PW7 added that there was no complaint by V of any pain or tenderness to his forehead. PW7 agreed with the prosecution that the injuries are more consistent with a contact being made to the temple near the eye, rather than the forehead.[\[note: 128\]](#Ftn_128)

>> (xi)       The AP gave evidence that two slaps on the forehead would not cause redness or tenderness to the forehead despite the fact that V saw the doctor very soon after the incident.[\[note: 129\]](#Ftn_129) He added that while V would have felt a sudden kind of pain as a result of the slap on his forehead, he will not feel the pain on his forehead as there is “not much nerve in that area”.[^130] I rejected the AP’s aforesaid evidence as he is not a medical expert and is not in a position to give his opinion on this matter. His evidence as to whether V would or would not feel pain is speculative. Further, his evidence as to whether there would be redness or tenderness is also speculative and should be disregarded. The AP did not at any point in time question any of the doctors as to whether two slaps on the forehead would cause redness or tenderness to the forehead. He did not put to the doctors that two slaps on the forehead would _not_ cause redness or tenderness to the forehead. The AP’s version, therefore, is wholly uncorroborated, and in fact, contradicted by medical evidence. Moreover, although the AP stated that V would not have felt pain on the forehead, he later contradicted himself and agreed with the DPP that that had V been slapped on his forehead twice, he would have felt pain on the forehead and that he would have told the same to PW2 contemporaneously. He further accepted that V did not in fact complain to PW2 about any pain to the forehead.[^131]

>> (xii)       Based on the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the AP punched P on the left temple near the left eye at least once.

> _Whether the AP intended to cause hurt or knew that it was likely that he would cause hurt to V ?_

> (f)     I agreed with the prosecution that the AP intended to cause hurt or knew that it was likely that he would cause hurt to V for the following reasons as stated by the prosecution:

>> (i)       During cross-examination, the AP admitted that he knew that by hitting V, he would likely cause hurt to V:

>>> Q    I put it to you---that when you hit Mr Chong, you knew that he would feel pain.

>>> A    Yes.[\[note: 132\]](#Ftn_132)

>> (ii)       However, the AP claimed that he did not intend to cause pain to V as “from the way I tap him, I know that it will not cause any harm”. He likened the situation to be like him “slapping my son hand”.[\[note: 133\]](#Ftn_133) He added that it was “like I making you wake up. Like same like a mother do to the children. Slap their hands and all that stuff”.[^134] Subsequently, the AP conceded that given his estranged relationship with V, he actually did not have any right to hit V as a form of corrective measure.[^135] In fact, he conceded that his relationship with V was not like a parent and child.[^136] Furthermore, the AP conceded that he was angry at the material time. He therefore had the motive to cause hurt to V:

>>> Q    So, on 8th of August, when you walked towards \[V\], did you feel provoked?

>>> A    Yah. I feel provoked.

>>> Q    And when you feel provoked, did you feel angry?

>>> A    I feel yes, at the moment I was angry.[^137]

>>> \---

>>> Q    So, I ask you for the last time, on 8th of August 2021, when you walked over to\[V\], in order to hit him, were you angry?

>>> A    Yes.[^138]

>> (iii)       The AP further agreed that he was frustrated with V for screaming at him.[\[note: 139\]](#Ftn_139) He also admitted that when he walked to the right-hand side of V’s bed, he was walking fast.[^140] I see no reason for the AP to have closed the distance between him and V in a fast pace, if not for the fact that he wanted to be in close striking distance to him. The AP’s explanation as to why he walked towards V was because he wanted to know why he screamed.

>>> Q    What was your intention in walking towards him?

>>> A    To ask him what was his reason for behaving like that.[^141]

>> (iv)       The AP gave evidence that V was still lying down at the point, and they were shouting with each other. His intention was to question V. When he walked over to V, he said “your age, you have a head to think. You are in your comfort zone. You have a chance to sleep, eat well. Why do you need to behave this way?” and he said that he was just frying an egg and was going fishing. Thereafter, the AP gave evidence that V just replied “You go and fish, lah”[\[note: 142\]](#Ftn_142). Later, the AP changed his evidence and said that he initially asked V “why do you need to scream like that? Why do you have to scream” and then V replied, “Why you care?”. Then the AP said “I just fry egg and I going fishing” and then V replied him rudely, “Go Lah!”. That is when the AP tapped V’s forehead and said that he was in his comfort zone. It is only when he replied to him rudely that he tapped his head. When asked again what his intention as to why he did so, he said that “because I want him to wake up. Don’t behave this way. You are in your comfort zone. There’s no reason to behave this way. Spoil the peace”.[^143] When confronted with the fact that there was no need to prod the forehead of the victim if he merely wanted to reason with him, the AP agreed as follows:

>>> Q    You agree with me that there is no reason for him \[sic\] to touch him at all… to cause physical harm?

>>> …

>>> A    I agree with you.

>>> Q    In the context of you walking over to him to reason with him, you agree with me that there is no reason for you to touch him?

>>> A    Yes

>>> Q    You could have spoken to him?

>>> A    I spoke. I did try.

>>> …

>>> Q    Yes or no? You could have spoken to him and tried again if you really wanted to reason with him. Right? Yes or no?

>>> A    Yes.[^144]

>> (v)       When asked if there was any other reason as to why he walked towards V other than the fact that he wanted to reason with him, the AP said no. He also conceded that he could have reasoned with V from the kitchen and that he did the exact opposite of the advice which was to walk away from the conflict when he walked towards V.[\[note: 145\]](#Ftn_145)

>> (vi)       As pointed out by the prosecution, the AP did not raise any argument in relation to whether he intended to cause hurt to V or knew that it will be likely that he will cause hurt to V by using force on him, and such silence on this issue in the AP’s submissions is telling of his acceptance that there is overwhelming evidence against him in relation to the mens rea of the offence. Hence, the only inference to be made from the AP’s aforesaid admissions is that he intended or knew that he was likely going to cause hurt to V when he walked towards V and when he punched V on the left temple near the left eye.

> _Whether the AP ’s act of punching V caused the injuries suffered by V, or whether the aforesaid injuries were already present on V?_

> (g)     I agreed with the prosecution that the injuries observed on V are as a result of the AP’s act of punching V on the left temple near the left eye and these injuries were not already present on V for the following reasons as submitted by the prosecution:

>> (i)       The AP confronted the various doctors with an allegation that V had sores on his head. However, at no point did the AP adduce any evidence to prove that V had sores on his face and not even that V had sores at the specific locations where the injuries were observed by PW7. The AP further said that if there were sores, it would be because “he tends to lie down too long on the pillow” and it will be “more on the forehead” and less on the front of the head.[\[note: 146\]](#Ftn_146)

>> (ii)       The AP emphasised that the back of the head has a lot of sores.[\[note: 147\]](#Ftn_147) Nothing was said in respect of the left temple of the head/face. While the AP stated that he had a photograph to show that V’s head was full of sores, he did not at any point adduce this for the Court’s reference or put his case to V in order for V to agree or disagree.

>> (iii)       In any event, PW7 clearly responded to, and dismissed the AP’s allegation at trial:

>>> Q    Okay. So, regarding the Mr Chong, what he based on, do you think that those things can be caused, like abrasion, by itself without anyone touching him? Is it possible?

>>> A    I think it’ll be less likely.[\[note: 148\]](#Ftn_148)

>>> …

>>> A    Yah. Because for these abrasions to occur, usually they don’t occur spontaneously, there has to be an element of friction, be it with an object or another foreign body.[^149]

>> (iv)       PW7 was also clear in stating emphatically that the report was made taking into account his condition at the point in time, which describes whatever is seen at the point in time.[\[note: 150\]](#Ftn_150) The inference from this is that PW7 did not see any sores on V’s face at the material time. Even if he did, he took into account the physical condition at the point in time and recorded abrasions. V was seen close to the time of the incident such that there could not have been any intervening event that could have caused the said injuries. In fact, V was immediately conveyed to SGH by way of ambulance when the police arrived.

>> (v)       I agreed with the prosecution submissions that :

>>> (1)       the AP did not dispute in his submissions that V did in fact suffer the injuries as stated in the medical reports. He did not challenge PW7’s evidence that such injuries were sustained by V. He did not even state in his submissions that in fact, PW7 was wrong to have said that there was an abrasion measuring 0.5cm and tenderness on the left temple near V’s left eye. His contention is that if he had punched V, the injuries sustained would have been more serious. This entirely misses the point that injuries were caused in the first place by the AP’s actions - if the AP did not even hit V on the left temple near the left eye area in the first place, there would not even have been any injuries on V’s left temple near the left eye area at all. The AP’s point that the injuries were not serious enough and inconsistent with being punched is beside the point given that the AP’s case in the first place is that he hit the forehead, and not the temple. The AP has not been able to explain to this Court how the injuries on the left temple near the left eye came about.

>>> (2)       As regards the AP’s submissions that V had pre-existing sores, there is no reason to doubt V’s account that he sustained the injuries after he was punched by the AP. The AP’s claim that V had sores all over his head which have been present for years and the injuries are therefore sores around his head runs contrary to logic. If that were indeed the case, then PW2, having been familiar with V as his neighbour, would have known that what she observed on V were sores rather than injuries. Furthermore, PW7, who gave evidence that he is familiar with acute injuries[\[note: 151\]](#Ftn_151), and who is a trained medical doctor, would clearly have been able to differentiate between sores and an injury.

>>> (3)       The AP’s contention that the injuries suffered by V would have been more serious if he had been punched is mere conjecture and speculation. The AP is not medically trained to give evidence on what sort of injuries one would expect if a person were punched. As stated by the PW7, it depends on how the person was punched and the amount of force used.[\[note: 152\]](#Ftn_152) The AP did not cross-examine the doctors on this point at all. He should therefore be precluded from making any such submission. The AP ought to have medical evidence to buttress his submission, which is sorely lacking. Furthermore, there is no medical evidence adduced by the AP stating that the injuries on V are _inconsistent_ with being punched on the left eye near the left temple.

>>> (4)       The AP claimed that if he had indeed punched V at the left temple near the left eye, the injuries caused would be bruises. In support of this, he referred to the medical report for his antecedent when he had pleaded guilty to an offence of punching V several times over his right eye region causing bruising over the right peri-orbital region measuring 2 x 2 cm, and mild tenderness over the right maxillary region, just a year prior to the present incident. If the AP wished to rely on the medical report for his antecedent, he should have admitted the same in the trial. Further, each case should be viewed independently and decided on its own set of facts. It is wholly inappropriate for the AP to make comparisons to what happened in the past. In any case, with reference to the medical report for the AP’s antecedent, the report stated that V was punched six times over his right eye. It is therefore perfectly understandable that V suffered bruises over the area given the number of blows made to his right eye. This is as opposed to the present incident, where only one blow was made to the left eye area near the left temple.

>>> (5)       The AP’s pure speculation cannot trump the clear medical evidence that the injuries as observed on V were consistent with the fact that he was punched on the left eye near the left temple. V was injured and his injuries were not self-inflicted or arose from accident as the evidence points unequivocally to the fact that the AP caused these injuries and none of his explanations can absolve him of the charge.

>>> (6)       The AP appears to be running two mutually exclusive defences. If his case is that he did not hit the left eye area near V’s left temple at all, then he must provide the Court with an explanation on how the injuries as observed by PW7 and PW2 on V came about. His explanation proffered i.e., that there were sores on V’s face is simply not enough given the clear medical evidence that there were injuries. If his alternative case is that he hit the forehead, as he alleges, and if he accepts that the hit was “forceful”, then the AP must be able to explain to the Court why no redness was observed on V’s forehead by PW2 and why PW7 did not document any tenderness/redness on V’s forehead at all despite doing a thorough physical examination on V’s head. If it was in fact the case that the forceful hit was on V’s forehead, then this would not have been so easily missed by PW7, even in the rush of an emergency setting.

>>> (7)       The AP’s explanations do not in any way explain why V’s left temple and left eye had visible and documented injuries. Hence, the medical evidence must be preferred over the AP’s mere speculation. This makes the AP’s version of events implausible, given the sheer lack of contemporaneous evidence to support it.

> **_Issue (5): What is the AP’s defence to the charge, and has the AP raised a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case ?_**

> (h)     The AP stated in his submissions that V was not being punched but tapped on his forehead and whether it was regarded as forceful on V or not, he did not clench his fist and hit V with punches as accused. His defence as stated in his submissions[\[note: 153\]](#Ftn_153) was as follows:

>>> “_I do agree that physical contact was made. However, \] did not punch PWI as I have been accused of._

>>> _If I truly had intended to hurt PWI with a punch, the injuries are likely to be more serious (such as bruising or maybe even cuts) instead of just "abrasions and redness"._

>> (i)       It is clear that the AP’s defence to the charge is a bare denial that he punched V at all. He further denied that he intended to hurt to V. Instead, his case is that he merely tapped V ’s forehead twice as he wanted to wake him up, like a parent to a child. I have found the AP not to be a credible or truthful witness and his version of events is simply illogical and inconsistent with not only V ’s evidence, but also the objective and corroborative evidence of other prosecution witnesses and documents adduced by the prosecution at the trial. I see no merit in the AP’s submissions and found that the AP has no defence to the charge.

## CONCLUSION FOR THE TRIAL

7       My determinations on Issues (1) to (5) above and the unmeritorious AP’s submissions I found above have been made after my consideration and weighing of the merits of the parties’ arguments for which the AP who had acted in person gave no plausible arguments or explanations, unlike the prosecution whose legal and factual positions I preferred to that of the AP and which I had accepted_._ I was satisfied that the AP has no defence and that the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt on the charge in MAC-907226-2021 which has been preferred against the AP. Accordingly, I found the AP guilty and convicted him of the aforesaid charge.

## SENTENCE

#### Sentencing framework

8       The sentencing framework for an offence under s 323 PC _simpliciter_ is as laid out in _Low Song Chye v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> [^154](“**_Low Song Chye_**_”)_ at \[77\] – \[78\] with a two-step sentencing process as follows:

> (a)     First step – consider the actual harm caused by the offence, and determine the appropriate band for a first-time offender who pleads guilty:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="12.12%"><col width="56.24%"><col width="31.64%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Hurt caused</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Low harm:</b> no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to 4 weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Moderate harm:</b> hurt resulting in short hospitalization or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 4 weeks’ to 6 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Serious harm:</b> serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">necessitates significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between 6 to 24</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (b)     Second step – adjust according to the offender’s culpability and all other relevant factors.

9       In respect of the first step, I agreed with the prosecution that the present case falls within Band 1 of _Low Song Chye_ as minor hurt, in the form of tenderness and abrasion, was caused. This is counter-balanced by the fact that V was admitted to the hospital for a day and given four days of hospitalisation leave. The hurt was also of sufficient gravity that Dr Edgar Yeo, in consultation with Dr Chinmaya Joshi were of the view that CT scan should be ordered:

> Q    Did you assess the injuries to be serious enough to warrant a CT scan?

> A    In this case, it would not be unreasonable to carry out the CT scan because there may be certain injuries or fractures that may not be picked up on just a gross examination.[\[note: 155\]](#Ftn_155)

#### Sentencing considerations

10     I accepted the prosecution submission that based on the first step alone, an appropriate sentence would be a custodial term of up to one week, but I took the view that an uplift of two weeks (instead of at least three weeks as submitted by the prosecution) will adequately take into account the following sentencing considerations:

> (a)     Enhanced punishment of up to four years' imprisonment is applicable, since V is vulnerable victim under s 74A of the Penal Code. V is a 64-year-old man with blindness. He is also partially deaf. The AP was already aware of V's condition when he lived with V for about six years. Instead of showing consideration for V's condition, the AP responded disproportionately to V's shouting. By virtue of his blindness, V could not have been able to anticipate an attack, nor see the AP’s approach to him.

> (b)     The AP has a relevant antecedent for which he was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment in respect of an offence committed against the same victim.

> (c)     The previous antecedent was recent being on 26 August 2020.

> (d)     In _PP v Loi Chye Heng_ _<span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 90</span>_, the Court recognised that abuse of position of trust is an aggravating factor[^156]. In the present case, the AP occupied a position of trust and responsibility vis-à-vis V. He was a caretaker to V, as his housemate. The AP gave evidence that V was reliant on him and agreed that by virtue of him staying with V and helping V with his chores, he was V's sole caretaker[^157].

> (e)     I found nothing mitigating in the AP’s oral mitigation plea.

## CONCLUSION ON SENTENCE

11     In the light of the above, I sentenced the AP to three (3) weeks imprisonment for the charge preferred against him in MAC-907226-2021. In my view, the aforesaid sentence which I have imposed on the AP was not manifestly excessive or inadequate, but wholly appropriate and commensurate with the nature and extent of the AP’s culpability, and was a sufficient deterrent sentence tempered with proportionality without the effect of a crushing sentence.

[^156]: In this case, the accused person was convicted and sentenced to one charge under s 323A of the Penal Code read with s 74A(2) of the Penal Code. The Court imposed an uplift of four months' imprisonment on account of the fact that the victim was vulnerable (due to mental retardation and old age). The Court took into consideration the fact that the accused did not occupy a position of trust and responsibility vis à-vis the victim and was not a caretaker of the victim in arriving at the amount of uplift to be imposed.
