Tort – Negligence – Industrial Accident

1 August 2019

### District Judge James Leong Kiu Yiu:

## Introduction

1       The Defendant is in the business of, inter alia, building construction work. The Plaintiff was a construction worker from India employed by the Defendant under a work permit. The trial of this matter concerned the claim of the Plaintiff against the Defendant for injuries purportedly sustained in an industrial accident in the course of his employment. It was the Plaintiff’s pleaded case that the accident occurred at about 11.30 am on 15 January 2016 at a construction site in Yishun. The Defence was premised on a denial that the Plaintiff sustained the injuries in the course of his employment on the date and place as pleaded i.e. on 15 January 2016 at Yishun. Contributory negligence was not pleaded in the Defence.

## Decision

2       Following the conclusion of the trial and the exchange of written submissions, I ordered on 13 June 2019 interlocutory judgment for the Plaintiff with interest and costs to be reserved to the Registrar hearing the assessment. On 26 June 2019 the Defendant appealed against my decision to the High Court. Elaborating on the brief oral reasons that I delivered on 13 June 2019, these are my written grounds of decision.

## The Trial

3       The trial was heard over three days on 22-23 October 2018 and 25 February 2019. Four witnesses testified for the Plaintiff and one witness testified for the Defendant as follows:

> i.     The Plaintiff (PW1);

> ii.     Mr Satthapan Ganesan (PW2): A former employee of the Defendant who worked as a safety supervisor at the relevant time;

> iii.     Dr Henry Chan(PW3): The 1st treating doctor who treated the Plaintiff on 19 January 2016 at CHANLAI Healthcare Clinic;

> iv.     Dr Thant Zin (PW4): The doctor who treated the Plaintiff on 21 January 2016 at Bless Medical Centre Pte Ltd;

> v.     Mr Alangaram Anthonysamy (DW1), The Defendant’s project coordinator.

4       After hearing the evidence of all the witnesses, directions were given for the exchange of written submissions. The Plaintiff and the Defendant exchanged one set of closing submissions dated 29 April 2019 (“PCS”) and 30 April 2019 (“DCS”) respectively. This was followed by the reply submissions of the Defendant dated 16 May 2019 (“DRCS”).

## Chronology of Events

5       The chronology of events below is reproduced from the table at page 7 of PCS. Save for the first event which was keenly disputed and essentially the crux of the case, there was no significant dispute regarding the other events in the chronology.

## The Defendant’s Case

6       The case of the Defendant is outlined at \[2\] of DCS as follows:

> a.     The Plaintiff is a foreign worker from India and at all material times he was employed by the Defendant under work permit as a construction worker.

> b.     At the material time the Defendant had projects in 2 worksites, namely, the Yishun worksite and the Jurong Island worksite;

> c.     The records produced by the Defendant shows that the Plaintiff was working at the Jurong Island worksite on 15.1.2016. The Plaintiff shifted to the Yishun worksite the following day i.e. 16.1.2016;

> d.     The Plaintiff did not sustain any workplace injury on 15.1.2016 at the Yishun worksite;

> e.     The Defendant further contends that the Plaintiff had only complained of eye pain on 19.1.2016 and was given a medical chit to see the doctor, which the Plaintiff did so at about 11.30am;

> f.     The Defendant contends that the pleaded case of the Plaintiff being that he sustained workplace injury on 15.1.2016 cannot stand;

> g.     The Defendant will refer to the Notice of Assessment by the Commissioner for Labour denying work injury compensation under WICA on the ground that an injury arising out of and in the course of work has not been established.

## Analysis

7       Analysing the totality of the evidence for the Plaintiff, I found that the Plaintiff’s version of the accident was supported and corroborated by PW2. There was no evidence of any collusion, ulterior motive or benefit that PW2 would derive from testifying in this case. The Plaintiff’s version of events i.e. that the accident occurred on 15 January 2016 was also broadly consistent throughout as told to the different doctors that he saw, save for the one instance of his wanting to change before PW4 the date of the accident from 15 to 19 January 2016.

8       The account of the accident was also consistent in the Incident report filed. While these may well be self-serving as suggested by counsel for the Defendant, they may also be an indication of the truth of the testimony. After all, if the various accounts of the accident had been inconsistent, they would surely have been relied upon to attack the credibility of the Plaintiff.

9       Turning to the four-day delay in seeking treatment, I did not find the explanation of the Plaintiff to be unreasonable. While it would be optimal if medical attention was received immediately, different persons would have different thresholds for pain. The circumstances of the Plaintiff as a foreign worker would also have to be considered. In this regard, the trust he placed in his employers to only seek treatment when permitted four days later and even reporting for work in the interim was equivocal.

10     As for the medical evidence presented at trial, it was pertinent to note that there was no suggestion or evidence that the injuries were inconsistent with the account of how the accident occurred i.e. by metal debris from the tip of the nail. The submissions focused instead on whether it occurred on 15 January 2016 as contended by the Plaintiff or at a later date as contended by the Defendant. Considering that the two treating doctors PW3 and PW4 were called by the Plaintiff essentially to testify in relation to what transpired at the medical examinations before them rather than on whether the injuries were consistent or inconsistent with how it was alleged to have occurred, I was not persuaded by the submissions of the Defendant that their testimony supported the fact that the accident did not occur on 15 January 2016. In this regard, if the Defendant wanted to rely on expert medical opinion to support their claim that the accident could not have occurred on 15 January 2016 or that it could not have occurred in the way the Plaintiff alleged that it did or was perhaps natural or even self-inflicted, they could and should have requested for a medical re-examination before a specialist better qualified to touch on these issues.

11     In my view, the strongest evidence for the Defendant was potentially the attendance records for the two worksites. In this regard, clearer and better record keeping beyond scribbled signatures on an attendance sheet or tamper resistant records would have helped establish the Defence. Ideally, this evidence should be independent, for example from the main contractor or the Jurong Island authorities rather than the time sheets that were exhibited by DW1 without clear explanation or verification as to their authenticity. It is pertinent to note that save for DW1, no attempt was made to call any of the Plaintiff’s other co-workers to assert that he was not at Yishun on 15 January 2016. While DW1 does attest to that in his AEIC, he may well have been mistaken since it is not apparent that he was there throughout, especially given his managerial and supervisory responsibilities. This is in contrast to PW2 who gave clear testimony that the Plaintiff was at Yishun on 15 January 2016.

12     While the Defence made reference to the protective qualities of the safety goggles provided, the point was not fully developed in the AEIC of the Defendant’s sole witness DW1. There was also no credible evidence at trial that the googles, if properly worn, would have prevented the injury.

13     As for the ruling of the Assistant Commissioner for Labour being determinative, the closing submissions did not refer to any controlling authorities in support of the purported definitive nature of the findings of the Assistant Commissioner. In the absence of any material as to the basis for the determination or authority as to the effect of such a finding, the fact that the Plaintiff was not successful in his workmen compensation claim was not conclusive either way. It was also noted that only one of the two persons involved in the proceedings before the Assistant Commissioner i.e. DW1 was called for the trial. Furthermore, it is pertinent that the Notice of Assessment of Compensation at DBD8 itself expressly allowed a party to dispute the assessment within 14 days of the date of service and contained the following Comissioner’s Directions:

> **“(1**)     **To all parties:**

>> (a)    In pursuance of the Work Injury Compensation Act, I have made an assessment on the outcome of the claim as stated in Part II above.

>> (b)    Any party who agrees to this assessment do not have to reply to the Ministry. The party who wishes to dispute this assessment must give notice of his objection to me using the attached prescribed form stating PRECISELY all ground(s) of objection WITHIN 14 DAYS from the date of service of this Notice. The Ministry will inform all parties if an objection is received. Any ground of objection received outside this 14-day period shall be disregarded.

>> (c)    This Notice of Assessment shall be deemed to have been agreed upon by all parties and shall have the effect of an Order under the Act on-

>>> (i)    the 15th day after the Notice is served where no objection is received by me within 14 days after the service of the Notice; or

>>> (ii)   the 29th day after the Notice is served where all objections so received by me are withdrawn within 28 days after the service of the Notice.

> No appeal shall lie against such an Order.

> (**2**)     **To claimant:**

>> (a)    You will NOT be able to withdraw your claim after an Order referred in the above paragraph 1(c) has taken effect. However, under section 33(2B) of the Work Injury Compensation Act, you would still retain the right to institute a civil suit to seek damages against the employer. This is applicable only where the said Order is in respect of an assessment for no compensation payable for the claim on the ground(s) that the accident is found not to be work-related and/or the employee is deemed not covered under the Act.”

14     The fact that the Plaintiff did withdraw his claim within the period allowed by way of letter dated 15 April 2016 at DBD24 to proceed under Common Law as acknowledged by the letter of 19 April 2016 from the Ministry of Manpower at DBD25 militates against the determinative nature of the ruling. This is reinforced by the commissioner’s direction to the claimant reproduced above that expressly permits the claimant to institute a civil suit even if the claim was not withdrawn.

## Conclusion

15     In light of all of the above, I formed the view that the Plaintiff had succeeded in establishing his case on a balance of probabilities. While the evidence could have been clearer or stronger, the fact remained that the Plaintiff had furnished sufficient cogent evidence in support of the claim and the Defendant was unable to successfully rebut the Plaintiff’s case.

16     Separately, while there would certainly have been an element of personal responsibility as to how the accident occurred, I was unfortunately constrained from apportioning liability as contributory negligence was not pleaded in the Defence.

17     Accordingly, interlocutory judgment for the Plaintiff for damages to be assessed with interest and costs reserved to the Registrar conducting the assessment was entered for the Plaintiff.
