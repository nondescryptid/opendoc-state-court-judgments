Tort – Defamation – Justification

Tort – Defamation – Qualified privilege – Malice

20 May 2020

### District Judge Tan May Tee:

1       This is the second libel action brought by the plaintiff against the defendant arising out of their interactions with each other as council members of a management corporation. An order had been made for the suits to be heard one after the other, and both actions were fixed for trial before me.

2       The plaintiff is a senior lawyer, having been in practice for close to fifty years. The defendant is a homemaker. She previously worked as an auditor over 30 years ago but gave up her profession in 1991 to take care of her children.

3       Both parties reside at the condominium development called Casa Merah and being subsidiary proprietors, they are part of the condominium’s management corporation, The Management Corporation Strata Title No. 3534 (“MCST”) pursuant to the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap 30C) (“BMSMA”). At the MCST’s sixth Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) in April 2016, they were elected to serve on the MCST’s management council (“MC”). The plaintiff had in fact served as the honorary secretary (“Secretary”) from the fourth MC and he continued his appointment as Secretary in the fifth and sixth MC. Concurrently, he was also involved in the sub-committees overseeing the security and the landscaping of the condominium at the material time. The defendant’s involvement in the MC started from the sixth AGM. She had decided to step forward for election as she found the maintenance and security of the Casa Merah grounds to be on the decline and she wanted to do her part to improve the estate by participating in the MC.

4       In the first suit, DC/DC 594/2017 (“DC 594”), the plaintiff’ had accused the defendant of defaming him in an email that she had sent on 25 October 2016 to all the MC members and the managing agent of the condominium, Melana International Pte Ltd. I delivered judgment dismissing the plaintiff’s claim in a written judgment, _Govinda s/o Aramvally Gopalan v Teoh Chooi Sian_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 111</span>, issued on 30 April 2020. While I found that the defendant’s email was defamatory of the plaintiff – it imputed that the plaintiff was not suitable to be the Secretary and should retire since he was incapable of handling the responsibility of ensuring that the minutes of MC meetings were accurate – I also found for the defendant on her defences of justification and qualified privilege. In my assessment of the evidence in DC 594, the malice allegations levelled by the plaintiff were not proven. They did not cross the high threshold necessary to negate the protection of qualified privilege accorded to the defendant in the publication of her defamatory email.

5       Among the matters pleaded[^1] by the plaintiff as malice in DC 594 was the complaint that the defendant had made about the plaintiff’s conduct to the Law Society of Singapore (“Law Society”) on 1 December 2016 (“the Complaint”) under s 85(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) (“the LPA”). The Complaint was considered and eventually dismissed by the Law Society’s Review Committee constituted under s 85(6) of the LPA.

6       The plaintiff’s second libel action in this suit is founded on the contents of the Complaint.

## Background

7       The parties first encountered each other at the AGM on 16 April 2016. During the AGM, the defendant had raised queries about the MCST’s then ongoing litigation with its former managing agent, Knight Frank Estate Management Pte Ltd (“Knight Frank”). This was a suit brought by Knight Frank against the MCST in the District Court in DC Suit No. 2341/2015 (“KF suit”).

8       As recounted in my judgment in DC 594, the KF suit was a claim by Knight Frank against the MCST for unpaid fees under its managing agent agreement. In turn, the MCST had counterclaimed damages for various breaches of contract. The MCST had appointed Central Chambers Law Corporation as its solicitors, and the fifth MC had authorised the plaintiff to liaise with them for the conduct of the litigation. The fifth MC had also given a signed mandate to the plaintiff to settle the suit. The contents of the settlement mandate were regarded by the plaintiff as privileged and not to be disclosed to the defendant. The non-disclosure of the details of the KF suit was to become the source of strife between them. The KF suit was eventually settled on the day of trial on terms to be kept confidential as between the parties in that suit.

9       The sixth AGM saw the election of seven new members to the MC. They included the defendant and two other subsidiary proprietors, Amy Chan and Tan Beng Choo (“Tan”), whom the plaintiff named as the defendant’s good friends and members of her “camp”. This was denied by the defendant as she was introduced to Tan only on the day of the AGM by Amy Chan[^2]. The antagonism between the parties which began in the AGM continued in the MC meetings. At the first MC meeting in May 2016, the defendant did not support the plaintiff’s appointment as Secretary. The plaintiff perceived that the defendant, together with Amy Chan and Tan, had harboured a grudge against him for his refusal to disclose the settlement mandate in the KF suit at the sixth AGM. As outlined in my judgment in DC 594, the hostility between the parties is discernible from the email exchanges between the parties. These emails which carried various discussion threads were also copied to the other MC members as well as the managing agent[^3].

10     Tan was subsequently removed as a council member at an extraordinary general meeting (“EOGM”) of the MCST held on 5 November 2016. This resulted from a complaint of misconduct arising from WhatsApp messages that Tan had sent to the chairperson of the MC, Alice Ng, which were regarded as defamatory. As Tan had refused to apologise to the chairperson, the MC members by a majority resolved that an EOGM be convened for her removal by the MCST. At the EOGM the plaintiff, as Secretary, had outlined the details of the misconduct to justify Tan’s removal, and the resolution for Tan’s removal was carried by a majority vote of the subsidiary proprietors who attended.

11     According to the plaintiff, the defendant was bitter with the removal of Tan at the EOGM. She then sent the Complaint against him to the Law Society in collusion with Tan and Amy Chan both of whom had also sent complaints. The plaintiff was informed in March 2017 that all the complaints had been dismissed. As the defendant (and presumably Tan and Amy Chan as well) had made statutory declarations supporting the matters stated in their complaints in compliance with the LPA, the plaintiff lodged police reports alleging that they had made false statements against him constituting offences under the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap 211). As no action was taken by the police against the defendant, the plaintiff then commenced this suit in November 2017[^4].

## The defamatory words

12     The plaintiff’s case is that the following words which appear as the four main headings in the Complaint are defamatory of him[^5]:

> _“(a_)     _The Lawyer's use of his status and expertise as an advocate and solicitor to make threats of legal proceedings in attempts to prevent council members of MCST 3534 ("Council Members") from exercising their rights and properly carrying out their duties._

> (_b_)     _The Lawyer's improper advice on and mishandling of the case against Knight Frank in DC Suit No. DC/DC 2341/2015 ("the Suit")._

> (_c_)     _The Lawyer's insistence that payment be made for the provision of unlicensed guards by April Security._

> (_d_)     _The Lawyer's failure to properly review the contract with April Security.”_

13     Further, in summarising the Complaint, the defendant had published the following words which are also defamatory of the plaintiff:

> “_The Lawyer's conduct has reached such a level of egregiousness that I can no longer ignore it. As the Lawyer has brushed aside all reminders to him to conduct himself appropriately, I believe that his bullying, overbearing, and/or negligent conduct must be brought to the Law Society's attention so the Law Society can take action to prevent this individual from continuing to tarnish the professional image of lawyers.”_

## Plaintiff’s claim

14     The plaintiff pleaded[^6] that the words in the Complaint as identified above (“the Words”), in their natural and ordinary meaning, meant and/or were understood to mean that:

> (a)     he had misused his status as an advocate and solicitor to make threats of legal proceedings with the motive of preventing council members from exercising their rights and properly carrying out their duties as council members;

> (b)     he had as a lawyer given improper advice and mishandled the case involving the MC;

> (c)     he had also wrongly insisted that payment be made of unlicensed guards;

> (d)     he had as a lawyer incompetently reviewed the contract with April Security; and

> (e)     in addition to being a bully and negligent, he had been defiant by refusing to conduct himself appropriately and was tarnishing the professional image of lawyers.

15     The plaintiff also pleaded[^7] by way of innuendo that the Words meant and were understood to mean that he was unfit to be a member of the legal profession or of the MC, being incompetent, intimidating and capable of condoning illegal activities.

16     It was further pleaded in the alternative[^8] that the Words are also capable of having a lesser meaning in that they intended to mean that the plaintiff was a dishonourable man and an incompetent lawyer.

17     The plaintiff claims[^9] that by virtue of the Words, he has been embarrassed and humiliated and has suffered damage to his reputation and standing as a practising advocate and solicitor, as the honorary Secretary of the MC, and as a member of the previous and the current MC.

18     In his claim for damages, including aggravated damages, the plaintiff pleaded reliance on, inter alia, the following matters[^10], namely:

> (a)     the tone and language used by the defendant in the Words; and

> (b)     the Words were published by the defendant maliciously, knowing they were false, or recklessly, not caring whether they were true or false.

## The Defence

19     The defendant admitted that she had sent the Complaint and that it contained the Words. She, however, denied that the Words bore or were capable of bearing the meanings as pleaded by the plaintiff and/or any meaning that was defamatory of the plaintiff. Even if the Words were defamatory, she raised the defences of justification, fair comment and qualified privilege to exonerate any liability.

### Justification

20     The defendant pleaded that even if the Words were capable of conveying the defamatory meanings pleaded by the plaintiff, they were true in substance and in fact, as outlined below:

> (a)     “_The Lawyer's use of his status and expertise as an advocate and solicitor to make threats of legal proceedings in attempts to prevent council members of MCST 3534 ("Council Members") from exercising their rights and properly carrying out their duties_”

>> (i)       The plaintiff had prevented the managing agent (“MA”) from answering a query posed by the defendant while she was carrying out her duties as an MC member. In the correspondence exchanged with the defendant, the plaintiff had referred to his status and expertise as an advocate and solicitor when he denied the defendant's request for information on the contractors engaged by the MCST. In particular, the defendant referred to the email from the plaintiff dated 25 May 2016 in which he had stated that he had reason to believe that the defendant was seeking confidential information related to the KF suit and his position was akin to “_in-house legal counsel for the MCST_” who would zealously protect the MCST’s interest to the confidential information. He had also challenged the defendant to sue him if she felt that he had made a baseless allegation against her.

>> (ii)       The plaintiff also prevented the MC from further discussing the settlement of the KF suit and implied that potential legal proceedings may be taken against the defendant when she queried the settlement. In his email dated 14 October 2016, he expressly referred to his status as an advocate and solicitor in which he reminded her “_in (his) capacity as an Officer of the Court_” that she should seek independent legal advice before she made any further comments in breach of the court order. He also reserved the MC’s rights against the defendant.

> (b)      _The Lawyer's improper advice on and mishandling of the case against Knight Frank in DC Suit No. DC/DC 2341/2015 ("the KF suit")_

>> (i)       All that the defendant knew of the KF suit was that it had been commenced by the former MA for unpaid management fees in the amount of $61,525.65, costs and interest, and that a counterclaim was filed by the MCST in the suit.

>> (ii)       The KF suit was pending at the end of the term of the fifth MC and the plaintiff was in charge of instructing solicitors and managing the conduct of the suit. After the plaintiff was re-elected to the sixth MC, he continued to perform the same role.

>> (iii)       The members of the sixth MC were not apprised by the plaintiff as to the substantive matters in the KF suit. The suit was settled on the first day of trial on 26 September 2016 The defendant thereafter sought clarification by way of an email sent on 13 October 2016 on whether there was any basis for withholding payment of the management fees to the MA and whether the suit could have been prevented. The plaintiff stopped the defendant from discussing the matter and implied that legal proceedings may be taken against her when she queried the settlement.

> (c)      _The Lawyer's insistence that payment be made for the provision of unlicensed guards by April Security_

>> (i)       April Security and Investigation Pte Ltd (“April Security”) was the former security company providing security services, including the provision of security guards, to Casa Merah.

>> (ii)       The plaintiff, as a member of the Security Sub-committee, met with the management of April Security on 5 October 2016 to discuss the issue of outstanding payments due from the MCST. April Security acknowledged that it had deployed unlicensed security guards to Casa Merah but nonetheless sought reimbursement for the salaries and foreign worker levies it had paid to these unlicensed guards.

>> (iii)       In an email sent on 10 October 2016 at 3:49pm, the plaintiff asked the MC to make payment to April Security for the provision of the guards notwithstanding that they were unlicensed. The plaintiff justified payment by saying that he was “trying to avert legal action which is time consuming and expensive.”

> (d)      _The Lawyer's failure to properly review the contract with April Security_

>> (i)       The plaintiff, as a member of the Security Sub-committee, had reviewed and approved the contract with April Security on behalf of the MC.

>> (ii)       The contract was found lacking in key clauses stipulating the scope of April Security's services.

### Fair comment

21     The defendant pleaded that the Words contained the following comment or expression of opinion, namely:

> (a)     The plaintiff had abused his status and expertise as an advocate and solicitor to prevent MC members from exercising their rights and carrying out their duties.

> (b)     The plaintiff had provided improper advice and mishandled the case against the former MA.

> (c)     The plaintiff insisted on paying for unlicensed guards even though this was wrong.

> (d)     The plaintiff had failed to properly review the contract with April Security.

> (e)     The plaintiff’s conduct has reached a level of egregiousness which the defendant could no longer endure.

> (f)     The defendant believed that the plaintiff's conduct was bullying, overbearing and/or negligent.

She relied on the same facts set out for her justification defence in support of a defence of fair comment.

### Qualified privilege

22     Even if the Words were defamatory, the defendant’s case is that they were published on an occasion of qualified privilege[^11] based on the following:

> (a)     The plaintiff is an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.

> (b)     The Complaint was made to the Law Society which regulates the professional standards expected of lawyers in Singapore.

> (c)     As a member of the public, the defendant had a legitimate interest to make the Complaint and communicate the Words to the Law Society.

> (d)     The Law Society, as the regulator of professional standards amongst lawyers in Singapore, had a legitimate interest to receive and/or be informed of the plaintiff's conduct as set out in the Complaint.

> (e)     In the circumstances, the defendant and the Law Society had a common and corresponding interest in the subject matter of the Complaint.

## Issues

23     Based on the pleadings and submissions of the parties, the issues before the court are:

> (a)     whether the Words in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory of the plaintiff;

> (b)     if the Words were defamatory of the plaintiff, whether they were true in substance and in fact;

> (c)     if the Words were defamatory of the plaintiff, whether they were communicated on an occasion of qualified privilege;

> (d)     if the Words were communicated on an occasion of qualified privilege, whether the defence of qualified privilege is defeated by malice; and

> (e)     if the defendant is found liable in defamation, what is the appropriate award of damages that ought to be made to the plaintiff.

24     While the plaintiff had included a plea of innuendo, he did not plead any particulars of the facts and matters relied on, as required by O 78 r 3 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5), to support a meaning other than the natural and ordinary meaning of the Words. Hence, any possible issue of an innuendo meaning arising from Words can be disregarded.

25     Although fair comment is pleaded as one of the defences, it is no longer an issue the court has to deal with. This defence has been abandoned, as informed by counsel for the defendant in her Closing Submissions[^12].

### Whether the Words in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory of the plaintiff

26     The general principles applicable to the construction of words based on their natural and ordinary meanings have been succinctly stated by the Court of Appeal in _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard v Koh Sin Chong Freddie_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 1 SLR 506</span> (“_Chan Cheng Wah”_) at \[18\]. The cardinal principle is that the natural and ordinary meaning must be that which is conveyed to an ordinary reasonable person. However, in determining the scope of possible meanings that the words may bear, it is needful to consider the class of reader of the impugned publication, see _Chan Cheng Wah_ at \[19\].

#### Class of reader

27     In the present case, where the Words are set out in a complaint lodged with the Law Society, the class of reader would be limited to the relevant members of the Law Society to whom the Complaint had been circulated. In the ordinary course of how complaints against practitioners are dealt with under s 85 of the LPA, the likely readers of the Complaint would have included the council members of the Law Society, the administrative personnel at the Law Society’s secretariat, the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel as well as the two persons appointed to the Review Committee (comprising an advocate and solicitor of not less than 12 years’ standing and a Legal Service Officer who has not less than 10 years’ experience) under s 85(6) of the LPA.

#### Natural and ordinary meanings

28     Taken in the context of the entire Complaint, the natural and ordinary meanings of the pleaded Words would be that the plaintiff, being a member of the legal profession, had been guilty of inappropriate conduct in that he had:

> (a)     abused his status as an advocate and solicitor to make threats of legal proceedings in order to prevent the MCST council members from exercising their rights and properly carrying out their duties;

> (b)     given improper advice to, and mishandled the MCST’s case against its former managing agent;

> (c)     wrongly insisted that payment be made by the MCST for unlicensed guards; and

> (d)     failed to properly review the contract with the MCST’s security service provider, April Security.

29     Further, the Words in the summary of the Complaint meant that the plaintiff had been negligent, had also been overbearing and a bully and his refusal to conduct himself appropriately despite reminders to do so was egregious and had tarnished the professional image of lawyers.

30     The natural and ordinary meanings of the Words as set out above implied, at the very least, that the plaintiff had behaved or conducted himself in an egregious manner such that it had tarnished the image of the legal profession as a whole. This imputation of misconduct on the part of a senior lawyer is clearly defamatory as it would undoubtedly lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally, and in particular of the Law Society.

### If the Words were defamatory of the plaintiff, whether they were true in substance and in fact

31     To succeed in a defence of justification, the defendant is required to establish the truth of the ‘sting’ or imputation of the defamatory statements. As stated by the Court of Appeal in _Chan Cheng Wah Bernard_ at \[43\], it is the imputation contained in the words which has to be justified, not the literal truth of the words.

32     The defendant had sought to justify each of the four heads of her Complaint from the details set out in the body of the Complaint as well as the supporting documents annexed thereto.

#### The Lawyer's use of his status and expertise as an advocate and solicitor to make threats of legal proceedings in attempts to prevent council members of MCST 3534 ("Council Members") from exercising their rights and properly carrying out their duties.

33     In relation to the first head of the Complaint, the defendant pointed to two specific email exchanges between her and the plaintiff in which he had referred to his status as a lawyer which she had perceived to be intimidating. She had sent the emails in her capacity as a member of the sixth MC carrying out her duties.

34     She also referred to the emails exchanged on the drafting of the minutes of the fifth MC meeting of 14 September 2016 (the date was wrongly stated as 12 September 2016 in the Complaint). When she maintained her objection to the recording of the “extended mandate” for the KF suit in the minutes even though it was not discussed at the meeting, the plaintiff had instructed the MA to disregard it. The plaintiff had also accused her of malice after she had sent her email of 25 October 2016 agreeing with her fellow council members on the way the minutes were recorded, which is the subject matter of DC 594.

(A)   “In-House Legal Counsel”

35     The first email chain started with the defendant’s email dated 16 May 2016 which she had sent to the MA when she first assumed her role on the sixth MC. The MA had informed the MC members of the renewal of the security services contract with April Security and she had replied to ask how the contract had been awarded, and whether staffing of the security guards had been presented to the council for discussion. She had in the same email requested information on the term contractors that had been engaged by the MA.

36     The plaintiff took upon himself to respond by asking her to state her reasons for the documents before he would direct the MA to provide them and told her to specify any wrongdoing by the MA or MC members if she had such information. In reply, the defendant stated that she required the information on the term contracts to enable her to discharge her duties diligently under s 61 of the BMSMA. She also highlighted that when MC members request for information, this did not equate to any suspicion of wrongdoing. The exchange continued with the plaintiff saying that he had reason to believe that the information or documents she was seeking pertained to issues in the KF suit which he feared might be relayed to Knight Frank to the detriment of the MCST. The defendant was understandably upset by the accusation and she replied saying,

> “As an educated person, you should know better than to make baseless accusations. The information that I am asking for is related to contracts that are currently being performed. If you have proof of any ties that I have to Knight Frank, please produce it. If not, REFRAIN from making this accusation again.”

37     The plaintiff responded and made reference to his position as a lawyer in the following terms:

> “My position in the MCST is akin to In-House Legal Counsel for the MCST and to zealously protect the MCST’s interest in the course of the civil suit in particular, to confidential information. My concern is that this information may be relayed to KF. Hence I premised my statement with the remarks “reason to believe” with the emphasis to protect the MCST’s interest during the civil suit.

> …

> If you still insist that I have made baseless accusations against you, you should sue me quickly or put this matter to rest once and for all”_._

(B)   “Officer of the Court”

38     The second email exchange[^13] was after the KF suit was settled. The plaintiff had reported to the MC on the settlement in his email dated 12 October 2016 setting out in summary the payments that the MCST had made. In response, one of the MC members, Roger Hu, sent three consecutive emails the last of which was on 13 October 2016 at 510pm asking whether the total payable by the MCST including legal costs amounting to $81,500 had exceeded their budget. He noted that the MCST owed Knight Frank $45,000, which sum had to be paid in any event. He also made the observation that the MCST was now paying an additional $35,874 at the end of the case and the MC should prepare to answer any queries that might be raised by the subsidiary proprietors at the AGM.

39     The defendant then queried in her email sent on 13 October 2016 at 6.25pm why the amount owed to Knight Frank was withheld since if the sum had been paid, the MCST would not have been sued and there would be a savings of $35,000 instead. She ended her email by asking if anyone would care to enlighten the council. One of the MC members who had also served from the fifth MC, Abdul Rashib, replied at 7.48pm to give his recollection of the issues which had led to the MCST withholding payment. The defendant responded at 8.57pm the same day to thank him for the explanation given.

40     The next day, 14 October 2016 at 6.57pm, the plaintiff sent an email addressed to the defendant stating as follows:

> “Dear Miss Teoh,

> I would remind you (in my capacity as an Officer of the Court) that you get independent legal advice before you make any more thoughtless comments on the matter in breach of the Order of Court (para 4) and expose unwitting Council members to also be in breach. You will note that in my email to members I carefully avoided making any comments on the reasons why we resisted the KF claims.

> All rights are reserved.”

##### Did the plaintiff abuse his status as advocate and solicitor by obstructing access to documents and information?

41     The defendant testified that she had understood the words “akin to an in-house legal counsel” in the plaintiff’s email of 25 May 2016 to mean that he was exercising his professional skills as a lawyer to help the MCST and had considered her request for information and documents through the perspective of a lawyer for the MCST. She had found it egregious that the plaintiff had challenged her to take legal action against him when she asked him for proof of his accusation that she had ties with Knight Frank.

42     She was also not provided the information on the term contracts that she had sought for the purpose of performing her duties as a council member.

43     The plaintiff had asserted in his AEIC that the defendant’s complaint that he had obstructed her access to documents was false[^14]. In cross-examination, the plaintiff was adamant that all the information and documents sought by the defendant had been duly provided as could be seen in his three emails, save for the settlement mandate in the KF suit[^15].

44     Having examined the email exchanges in the Agreed Bundle of Documents (all of which had been agreed as to authenticity as well as content), I found that the defendant had only been provided the scope of duties of the sub-committees in accordance with the plaintiff’s direction to the MA. As for the term contracts, she had simply been referred to the documents circulated at the sixth AGM. For other documents, the defendant was directed to make an application to the MA under s 47 of the BMSMA. She was subsequently allowed to view the managing agent and security services contracts at the MA’s office.

45     The underlying reason for the plaintiff’s reluctance to furnish or share information and documents with the defendant was his suspicion of a mala fide intent on her part. In his AEIC[^16] as well as his letter[^17] to the Law Society’s Inquiry Panel in response to the Complaint, he had reiterated his belief that the defendant’s quest for information was so that it could be relayed to Knight Frank to the detriment of the MCST. The tenor of the entire chain of communications between the plaintiff and the defendant seemed to be permeated by his suspicion of the defendant’s affiliation with Knight Frank

46     The defendant had categorically denied the plaintiff’s allegation. She had, from the very first MC meeting, declared to the entire council that she had no personal interest in the KF suit which had been recorded in the minutes of that meeting[^18]. Upon assuming office as a council member, she had also signed two separate declarations[^19]. The first declaration was to safeguard confidential information of the MCST. The second declaration was to act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of her duties and responsibilities as well as an undertaking not to use her position as a council member to gain directly, or indirectly, an advantage for herself or any other person, or to cause detriment to the MCST. These are statutory requirements imposed by s 60 and s 61 of the BMSMA, and any breach committed by a council member is tantamount to an offence which upon conviction could render the offender liable to a fine or to imprisonment.

47     In my view, it was unreasonable of the plaintiff, and also unfair, to persist in maintaining his allegation against the defendant when he was not prepared to back it up with any evidence. The defendant was understandably indignant at the accusation levelled against her and had told the plaintiff to refrain from making his accusation which went unheeded. No admissible evidence had been adduced in this suit or in DC 594 to support the plaintiff’s allegation against the defendant. Without such evidence, the plaintiff’s assertion of the defendant’s alleged association or affiliation to Knight Frank has to be regarded as conjecture.

48     Touching on the issue of giving access to documents, the plaintiff had stated in his AEIC as follows:

> 42.    I was the Hon Sec under the provisions of Section 56 of the BMSMA. The Defendant knew my duties therein. Similarly, if she was concerned about her duties to the MC, she could exercise her rights under Sections 47 and 113 and also exercise her rights during the 5th and 6th AGM under the BMSMA.

> 43.    During my term as Hon Sec of the 6th MC, the MA alerted me that the Defendant was frequently visiting the MA's office without prior notice and asking for confidential information of the SM for KF Suit. I then realised she had unusually keen interest in the KF Suit.

> 44.    The MA requested the Defendant to state her reasons for requesting documents and or to comply with Section 47(1) of the BMSMA as elaborated above. The Defendant although familiar with Section 47(1) did not comply. It was in this context that I wrote the email on 25th May 2016 @ 10.38 to clarify that I was in a similar position as an inhouse counsel with a duty to protect the confidentiality and interest of the MC pending the Mediation of the KF Suit.

49     It would appear that the plaintiff had directed the MA to require council members to apply under s 47 BMSMA and pay the prescribed fee to peruse the records maintained by the MCST including previous MC minutes and contract documents. In his response to the Law Society, he had stated that:

> “… I advised the MA that any Member requesting for documents/Minutes of Previous Council Meetings/matters pertaining to the 5th MC has to comply with the requirements of s47(1) of the BMSMA. This is to prevent the MA from being bogged down by unnecessary work caused by frivolous applications by any member conducting his own probe into the affairs of the previous MCs. Hence the Member has to do so in compliance with the BMSMA explained in my email (see email dated 24 May 2016 of Teoh’s Annexure)”

50     In making the reference to s 113 BMSMA, the plaintiff’s position must be that the defendant could have made the necessary application to the Strata Titles Board as her recourse for being denied access to the documents or information sought. Reading both s 47 and s 113 BMSMA, I did not think that these provisions were intended to apply to council members of a management corporation who, in the bona fide exercise of their due diligence duties under s 61 BMSMA, wish to have access to the documents and records of the MCST. Sufficient administrative controls could be easily put in place, such as allowing access only at the MCST’s management office, to prevent abuse or unauthorised disclosure of any confidential information.

51     While the defendant was eventually allowed to view some of the documents at the MA’s office, this was only in August 2016, some three months after she had made the initial request to the MA on 16 May 2016.

52     In paragraph 4a(iv) of the Complaint (reproduced below), the defendant had stated as follows:

> “The Lawyer instructed the MA not to carry out my request and asserted himself as the only person who should be giving directions to the MA. He also alleged that I wanted to obtain the information in order to give it to Knight Frank (which is a completely baseless allegation conjured by him out of thin air.) As there is completely no link between the contracts of the current term contractors of the MCST and the Knight Frank case … I can only infer that his allegation was made purely to obstruct my rightful access to the documents as a member of the Council.”

The defendant’s request, as she had clarified in her email of 24 May 2016, was for the contracts in the then current term (i.e of the sixth MC) which she wanted to peruse in the discharge of her duties as a council member. Given the plaintiff’s responses in his emails which displayed suspicion and antagonism and included a description of his position in the MCST as “akin to in-house legal counsel”, the defendant’s complaint of obstruction by the plaintiff of the performance of her duties, viewed objectively, was substantiated.

##### Did the plaintiff abuse his status as advocate and solicitor by threatening council members with legal proceedings?

53     The defendant had referred to the email exchanges[^20] on the settlement of the KF suit culminating in the plaintiff’s email time-stamped 14 October 2016 at 6.57pm in which he had admonished her as an “Officer of the Court” not to make any more “thoughtless comments” in breach of the Order of Court and stated that “All rights are reserved.” This email had clearly ended all discussion by the MC on the KF suit, the terms of settlement as encapsulated in the Order of Court dated 26 September 2016 and the arithmetic of the payments that the plaintiff had set out in his email of 12 October 2016 to the entire MC.

54     The Order of Court reflecting the settlement in the KF suit had stipulated in paragraph 4 as follows:

> “4. All parties to this Suit and/or their agents, servants and associates shall not repeat any of the allegations made in this action to any other persons or entities in any manner whatsoever.”

55     The plaintiff provided an explanation of his 14 October 2016 email by referring to the correspondence from Mr Ronnie Tan of Central Chambers Law Corporation, the MCST’s counsel, who had highlighted the obligation of confidentiality imposed by the Order of Court. This is the relevant portion in his AEIC:

> 46.    Given Central’s letter I commented (being a lawyer), I was also an officer of the Court. I merely advised her that she ought to get independent legal advice before disregarding the Court Order or go further into the merits of the MC’s Defence/Counterclaim which I feared she would do. This comment was not targeted at her alone but to all the other Council members who may be misled by the Defendant’s email. In reserving my rights, I merely intended to protect the MC’s interest if she disregarded the Court Order which resulted in any action by KF against the MC. The Defendant is entitled to disregard my advice.

56     The defendant’s position was that the plaintiff stifled all discussion as to his handling of the KF suit by making reference to himself as an officer of the Court to give a perverted interpretation of the Order of Court. She had understood that the prohibition in the Order of Court did not apply to council members and had used the word “perverted” to mean that the plaintiff had given a ridiculous interpretation to the Order[^21].

57     Reading paragraph 4 of the Order of Court, I thought that the interpretation given by the plaintiff was too restrictive. The prohibition was against repeating the allegations to _other_ persons or entities. If, for instance, the defendant were a company managed by a board of directors, taking the plaintiff’s interpretation, the directors would then be prohibited from discussing any part of the case amongst themselves should they be required to come up with an explanation to their shareholders as to the reasons for the settlement. This could not have been the intent of paragraph 4 of the Order. Surely, within the board of directors, and in the case of the MCST, the council members inter se, the prohibition would not apply. This is because each of them would be legally obliged to comply with the undertakings given to the MCST upon assuming office not to divulge to outsiders any confidential information shared with them.

58     While the plaintiff had said in his AEIC that his comment was directed to all council members, he had in fact addressed his email specifically to the defendant, rebuking her for her “thoughtless comments” and reserving his rights. Another MC member, Abdul Rashib, who had responded to the defendant’s email on the same day had shared various details of the MCST’s claim against Knight Frank[^22]. Abdul Rashib was, however, not taken to task by the plaintiff. When the plaintiff was cross-examined[^23] as to why he did not similarly administer a reprimand to Mr Rashib, the answer he gave was, “He was a council member. What authority have I got to reprimand him on this?”

59     Based on the email exchanges disclosed in the Agreed Bundle and the plaintiff’s own testimony, the defendant’s conclusion that the plaintiff had been selective in using his status as “Officer of the Court” to administer his warning against any further discussion of the KF suit was well supported.

60     Objectively considered, the use of the phrase “(a)ll rights are reserved” coupled with a reminder from an “Officer of the Court” to get independent legal advice in relation to comments made which were categorised as “thoughtless” by an advocate and solicitor could be construed as a threat of legal proceedings. It is therefore unsurprising that the defendant, as a lay person, had perceived it to be a threat. While the plaintiff may have been well-intentioned in preventing an unwitting breach of the Order of Court, the thrust of his email directed solely the defendant was to stifle any further discussion of the KF suit by issuing a warning in his capacity as a lawyer. Accordingly, I find that the defendant was justified in her complaint that the plaintiff had abused his status to make threats of legal proceedings in order to prevent the MCST council members from exercising their rights.

#### The Lawyer's improper advice on and mishandling of the case against Knight Frank in DC Suit No. DC/DC 2341/2015 ("the KF suit")

61     In support of this head of her Complaint, the defendant had stated _inter alia_ as follows:

> i.     The Lawyer was at all material times advising the MCST as his client, as admitted by the Lawyer himself in his email dated 24 May 2016 at 10.21PM to the Council, where he said “My position in the the MCST is _akin to In-House Legal Counsel for the MCST …”_

> …

> iv.     The Claim was so weak that on the first day of trial, the Judge again advised settlement, whereupon the matter was settled on that same day with the MCST making full payment of the sum claimed by Knight Frank.

> v.     To the best of my knowledge, the Lawyer had advised the previous Council to proceed with the claim, and this was done in spite of Chambers Law having advised on settlement (as I was informed by Ronnie Tan of Chambers Law, whom I managed to speak with when I attended Court on the first day of trial on 26 September 2016).

62     It was put to the defendant in cross-examination that the above statements were false and reckless since:

> (a)     it would have been clear to her that the plaintiff was not the lawyer acting for the MCST and the MCST was not his client;

> (b)     the MCST had not made full payment of the claim to Knight Frank as shown in the email sent by the plaintiff to the MC members; and

> (c)     she had no evidence to prove that the plaintiff had advised the MCST to proceed contrary to the advice given by Mr Ronnie Tan of Central Chambers.

63     In response, the defendant pointed out that she had not said that the plaintiff was “acting” for the MCST. She maintained throughout the cross-examination[^24] that she had used the words “advice” and “advising the MCST as his client” in her Complaint because the plaintiff had, in his email of 24 May 2016, held himself out to the MC that his position was that of an in-house counsel. This, in her mind, meant that he was assuming the position of being the MCST’s lawyer albeit in the role of in-house legal counsel in giving advice[^25]. She vehemently disagreed with the position put to her by counsel for the plaintiff that she had framed the Complaint in such a way as to mislead the Law Society into believing that the plaintiff was the lawyer for the MCST when she knew very well that he was not.

64     With regard to the MCST making full payment, this was also not a false statement. She had relied on the MCST’s accounts which showed that the outstanding management fees owed to Knight Frank then was about $46,000.00 and the MCST had made full payment of this sum in the settlement. As for the MCST wanting to proceed with the claim, this was what had been told to her by Mr Ronnie Tan when she spoke to him in court on the day of trial.

65     Reading the full particulars of the second head of the Complaint against the backdrop of her testimony during cross-examination, it was reasonably clear to me that the defendant was not alleging that the MCST was the plaintiff’s client in his law practice. Her complaint was that the plaintiff, in his self-assumed role as in-house legal counsel, had kept all information pertaining to the KF suit under the cloak of confidentiality and MC members like herself were left in the dark as to its details. This part of the complaint would appear to be true from my perusal of the documents. The minutes of the meetings of the sixth MC showed that only procedural updates (filing of pleadings, affidavits, trial date) were given. No details as to the subject matter of the claim or the issues in dispute could be found in the minutes of the 6th AGM when the defendant first made her queries on the suit. But this was likely because the plaintiff as “in-house counsel” had determined that the details of the suit should not appear in any of the minutes. Some details of the MCST’s claim were revealed in Abdul Rashib’s email, but this was on 13 October 2016, _after_ the KF suit was settled.

66     In relation to the assertion that the MCST’s claim was so weak that on the day of trial, Mr Ronnie Tan had advised the MCST to settle the suit, no independent evidence was adduced by the defendant. The plaintiff had submitted that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the defendant for her failure to call Mr Ronnie Tan as a witness to support her assertion. I did not think that Mr Ronnie Tan could be compelled to testify even if he had been subpoenaed since he would be obliged to maintain solicitor-client privilege to keep all matters discussed between him and the MCST confidential. Although this current suit has arisen from the parties’ dealings as MC members, it is still a personal matter between them. As such, I would decline to draw any adverse inference against the defendant for her failure to procure Mr Ronnie Tan’s testimony.

67     As to the defendant’s further assertion that the plaintiff had advised the previous council to proceed with the claim in spite of advice from the MCST’s lawyers on settlement, there was also no independent evidence tendered to the court in support thereof. The plaintiff had denied the allegation. He sought to circumscribe his role in the case to that of acting as a coordinator only vis-à-vis the MCST and the appointed lawyers. In all likelihood, however, since he was the only practising lawyer on the MC and had been given the mandate to represent the MCST in the suit, it would be unrealistic to assume that he had not given any legal input into the case, especially since he had ascribed to himself the role of in-house legal counsel. As for the MCST’s decisions to proceed with the claim initially and eventually to settle, these decisions were made by the majority of the council members at the material time.

68     The instructions to defend the KF suit were given during the term of the fifth MC and the mandate to the plaintiff was also given during the same term. The sixth MC had endorsed the decision of the fifth MC at its first meeting in May 2016. While the defendant may have had her reservations due to the scant information provided, the reality is that the decision was carried by a majority of the MC members. Unless there is clear evidence of fraud or misrepresentation, the plaintiff cannot be faulted for the decisions that had collectively been made by the MC. The grievances which the defendant had for being kept in the dark on the details of the suit is a separate matter.

69     On my assessment of the evidence adduced, the defendant has failed to discharge her burden of proving that the plaintiff had given improper advice on or mishandled the KF suit, even in his self-ascribed role of in-house legal counsel.

#### The Lawyer's insistence that payment be made for the provision of unlicensed guards by April Security

70     For this head of the Complaint, the defendant’s case was that April Security had acknowledged the deployment of unlicensed security guards to Casa Merah but had nonetheless sought reimbursement from the MCST for payments made to these guards. The plaintiff met with the management of April Security on 5 October 2016 to discuss the issue of outstanding payments due to April Security. Subsequently, in his email of 10 October 2016, the plaintiff asked the MC to make payment to April Security for the provision of the guards notwithstanding that they were unlicensed. The plaintiff justified the payment by saying that he was “trying to avert legal action which is time consuming and expensive”. The defendant was therefore concerned that the plaintiff was condoning an illegal act[^26] and had failed to act in the best interests of the MCST.

71     The plaintiff claimed that he could not possibly have known that unlicensed guards had been deployed at Casa Merah. April Security had apparently deployed these guards who were still undergoing training as they were facing a manpower shortage at the material time. It was not his duty, but that of the MA, to verify that the Casa Merah guards were licensed. He had merely commented that legal suits are time consuming and expensive, and April’s request for an amicable settlement was worth considering. He did not pressure the MC in any way as it was ultimately within the MC’s discretion to decide on the matter regardless of his personal view.

72     The plaintiff’s assertion in his AEIC that he could not possibly have known that April Security had deployed unlicensed guards at Casa Merah is contradicted by the documentary evidence. It appears that as early as 2 November 2015, the issue of unlicensed guards had been brought up at the Security Sub-committee meeting which he had attended as a sub-committee member[^27]. Nonetheless, the plaintiff’s email of 10 October 2016 to the MC members could not be construed as exerting pressure on the MCST to make payment for the unlicensed guards.

73     The plaintiff was entitled to state his views as a member of the MC, and it was ultimately for the entire MC to decide whether or not payment should be made. Accordingly, I find that the defendant has not proven her complaint that the plaintiff had insisted on payment to be made by the MC for the unlicensed guards.

#### The Lawyer's failure to properly review the contract with April Security

74     Under this head, the defendant’s complaint was that the plaintiff had reviewed and approved the contract with April Security on behalf of the MC as a member of the Security Sub-committee. The contract was found to be lacking in key clauses stipulating the scope of April Security’s services[^28] such as the number of guards the MCST was required to pay for.

75     The plaintiff’s evidence was that he was never briefed nor paid to review the contract as an advocate and solicitor. It had been prepared and used by the previous MA which he found to be adequate and satisfactory in all aspects.

76     As the contract with April Security was not produced in evidence to the court, I am unable to make any finding as to its adequacy or otherwise. This head of complaint is, therefore, not proven.

#### The Lawyer’s egregious conduct – bullying, overbearing, negligent

77     These were the descriptions used by the defendant in the penultimate paragraph of the Complaint. As a lay person, the defendant said she felt “intimidated by the Plaintiff who repeatedly used his status as a lawyer and his reference to the law”.[^29]The defendant explained[^30]during her cross-examination that she had hoped the Law Society would “stop his intimidating ways”. She had also listed the various instances during which she felt threatened by the plaintiff’s use of phrases such as “Officer of the Court” to portray himself as a lawyer to use his status to intimidate and threaten[^31] her. She hoped that the Law Society would “uphold the conduct of a lawyer not to use the status to intimidate laypeople like us”.[^32]

78     The plaintiff denied that he had misconducted himself in any manner. He pointed out that he had volunteered his services as honorary Secretary of the MC for the interest and benefit of the Casa Merah residents without remuneration. He had not at any time acted for the MCST in the KF suit. Neither had he reviewed any contract nor given advice on any of the contracts or matters relating to the sixth MC as an advocate and solicitor. Hence, he could not be guilty of negligence in any way whatsoever as an advocate and solicitor. He had also not been negligent in carrying out his duties as Secretary of the MC under s 56 of the BMSMA. The plaintiff emphasised that the Law Society’s Review Committee had dismissed the Complaint in its entirety for being frivolous, vexatious and misconceived.

79     The plaintiff had furnished to the Review Committee his response[^33] to the Complaint detailing how each of the allegations made was baseless, irrelevant and/or misleading. He set out as background his involvement as the Secretary in the MC, the interactions that he had with the defendant, Amy Chan and Tan, and repeated his suspicion of the defendant’s personal interest in the KF suit. He also recounted the MCST’s removal of Tan at the EOGM and his belief that this had incensed the defendant and precipitated the Complaint.

80     The plaintiff’s response highlighted that the matters complained of had arisen in connection with the exercise of his duties as the honorary Secretary. This was a position for which he had volunteered his services for the benefit and interest of the Casa Merah residents with no personal agenda. He believed that the defendant was motivated by malice because of the letter that he had written to her after her defamatory email dated 25 October 2016 (which was the subject of his libel action in DC 594).

81     It is pertinent to note the views of the Review Committee in respect of each head of the Complaint. This is what their report stated:

> (a)     1st complaint: We are of the view that the matters set out in the 1st complaint are not serious enough to constitute misconduct. Therefore, the 1st complaint should be dismissed for being frivolous and lacking in substance.

> (b)     2nd complaint: There is no evidence that the Respondent was acting for the MC in the Lawsuit in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor. Instead, it appears from the evidence that the Respondent’s role was merely to liaise with the MC’s solicitors in relation to the Lawsuit. Accordingly, the 2nd complaint is misconceived and should be dismissed.

> (c)     3rd complaint: The decision to pay the security provider was a matter of discretion for the Respondent, as a member of the MC. The 3rd complaint is therefore misconceived as well as frivolous and vexatious.

> (d)     4th complaint: There is no evidence that the Respondent was reviewing the contract in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor. Instead, he did so in his capacity as a member of the MC and found the contract to be adequate and satisfactory. Hence, the 4th complaint is frivolous, vexatious and misconceived.

82     Reading the contents of the Review Committee’s Report, it seems that they had regarded the second, third and fourth heads of the Complaint as misconceived as the matters complained of are what would normally fall within the scope of inadequate professional services under s 75B of the LPA. As there was no solicitor-client relationship between the plaintiff and the MCST at any time, the complaints would be misconceived. From the defendant’s evidence in cross-examination, she had explained that she made the complaints in the context of the plaintiff having assumed the role of the MCST’s in-house counsel.

83     As to the first head of complaint, the Review Committee took the view that they were not serious enough to constitute misconduct. While the Report had also categorised the complaint as frivolous and lacking in substance, it bears noting that the Committee’s views would have been based solely on a perusal of the written complaint, the plaintiff’s response and the various documents therein annexed. Unlike the court, they did not have the benefit of hearing the parties and their testimonies under cross-examination. Neither did they have the opportunity of examining the full range of the correspondences exchanged between the parties and amongst the MC members.

84     Having heard the parties’ testimonies and examined the records of their dealings in the Agreed Bundles of Documents, it is my finding that the evidence adduced by the defendant overall is insufficient to prove the defamatory sting of the Words that the plaintiff’s conduct was so egregious that it has tarnished the professional image of lawyers. That said, however, I am of the view that the grievances for which the defendant was attempting to find some form of redress through the Complaint were not entirely unfounded. The abrasive and hostile comments found in the plaintiff’s emails (examples of which are found in the judgment in DC 594) displayed a measure of high-handedness. She was genuinely intimidated and upset by the plaintiff’s conduct, and understandably so, since she, like the plaintiff, was also volunteering her time for the betterment of the estate.

### If the Words were defamatory of the plaintiff, whether they were communicated on an occasion of qualified privilege

85     The legal principles of the defence of qualified privilege are well established. The Court of Appeal in _Lim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 4 SLR 331</span> (“_Lim Eng Hock Peter_”) at \[34\] had endorsed the following summary in _Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore_ vol 18 (LexisNexis, 2004 Reissue) at paragraph 240.155:

> The defence of qualified privilege attaches to the occasion on which the words are published, rather than to the words themselves. It would be contrary to the purposes for which qualified privilege exists if the law applied an objective test of relevance to every part of the defamatory matter, as a precondition to the existence of the privilege. Words wholly unconnected with and irrelevant to the occasion may not be privileged; but generally, irrelevant and unnecessary words having some relation to the occasion will be within the privilege but will constitute evidence of express malice.

86     As to what could be regarded as occasions of privilege, the High Court in _Gao Shuchao v Tan Kok Quan & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 115</span> (“_Gao Shuchao_”) at \[35\] had referred to the following passage from _Gatley on Libel & Slander_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) at paragraph 14.9:

> “… the tendency of the courts has been to regard most privileged occasions under the common law as very broadly classifiable into two categories: first, where the maker of the statement has a duty (whether legal, social or moral) to make the statement and the recipient has a corresponding interest to receive it; or, secondly, where the maker of the statement is acting in pursuance of an interest of his and the recipient has such a corresponding interest or duty in relation to the statement, or where he is acting in a matter in which he has a common interest with the recipient.”

87     In his closing submissions, counsel for the plaintiff had contended that qualified privilege did not apply as the plaintiff was not acting as the lawyer for the MC, see below:

> “94.  The Defendant claims that she made the Defamatory Allegations on an occasion which entitles her to a defence of qualified privilege. The defence of qualified privilege protects the communication between the maker and the recipient only if there is a duty on the part of the Defendant to inform and a corresponding duty by the LSS to receive it. Only a fair and accurate record of the communication will be recovered (_sic_.) But this applies only if the MC was the Plaintiff's client. The Plaintiff was not the lawyer for the MC. Therefore with respect to the defence in respect of the _1_st_and 3_rd_set of Defamatory Allegations_, qualified privilege fails at the outset as the _lawyer’s conduct_ relied on by the Defendant did not amount to professional misconduct under S85(1) LPA that merited a complaint to the LSS.

> 95.    As to the _2_nd _and 4_th _Defamatory Allegations_ the Plaintiff was again not the lawyer for the MC and therefore could not have provided inadequate professional service within the meaning of 75B LPA to merit a complaint to the LSS. There is no basis nor could she have the _honest belief_ that the Plaintiff had either misconducted himself under S85(l) or provided inadequate service as the MC's lawyer under 75B LPA….”

88     This was clearly a misapprehension of the basis for the defendant’s Complaint. She had explained in her AEIC[^34] that she was of the view that the plaintiff was using his status as a lawyer and his knowledge of the law against the MC members which she did not think was proper for a lawyer. She understood that any member of the public could make a complaint against a lawyer if the “_lawyer’s conduct is not of a standard expected of a lawyer as a member of an honourable profession or as an officer of the Supreme Court._” Such a complaint need not be brought by that lawyer’s client and may be brought by “_any person against a lawyer who has not been appointed to act for him_” as stated on the Law Society’s website at https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/Lawyer-Regulation/Complaints/.

89     I understood from the defendant’s evidence that she was making the complaint against the plaintiff for his conduct towards his fellow MC members and not in the context of any solicitor-client relationship between the MC and the plaintiff. Such complaints of “conduct that is not of a standard expected of a member of an honourable profession” are allowed under the LPA and have been dealt with by the Law Society. Counsel for the defendant had cited the example of such a complaint in _Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDT 6</span> in which the misconduct complained of was in the nature of threats and abusive words which the lawyer had uttered towards her sister’s school teacher. The Disciplinary Tribunal had found the provocative and aggressive conduct of the lawyer towards the complainant and the school to be unacceptable, such conduct being regarded as “inappropriate” and “unbecoming” of a solicitor.

90     The plaintiff himself during cross-examination[^35] had accepted that members of the public could make complaints to the Law Society even without there being any solicitor-client relationship between the solicitor and the complainant.

91     The defendant had made the Complaint to the Law Society in pursuance of a legitimate interest borne out of her grievance against the plaintiff arising from his conduct in the MC which she had found to be overbearing and intimidating. The Law Society being the professional body that regulates the overall conduct of Singapore lawyers would correspondingly have a legitimate interest in the subject matter of the Complaint.

92     Accordingly, I find that the Complaint was made on an occasion of qualified privilege notwithstanding there being no solicitor-client relationship between the plaintiff and the MCST.

### Whether the defence of qualified privilege is defeated by malice

93     In _Gao Shuchao_ at \[37\] and \[38\], the High Court gave a succinct summary of the applicable principles on malice as follows:

> “37    … Malice can be found in two instances: (a) where it can be shown that the defendant had knowledge of falsity or was reckless as to the truth of the defamatory statement; or (b) where although the defendant may have a genuine or honest belief in the truth of the defamatory statement, he had the dominant intention of injuring the plaintiff or some other improper motive (_Lim Eng Hock Peter_ at \[38\]; _Golden Season Pte Ltd and others v Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 751</span> at \[92\]).

> 38    The inquiry as to the statement-maker’s state of mind under instance (a) is a subjective rather than an objective exercise and the threshold to be met is high (_Ezion Holdings Ltd v Credit Suisse AG_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 137</span> (“_Ezion_”) at \[25\]). The high threshold has been explained by Lord Diplock in _Horrocks v Lowe_ <span class="citation">\[1975\] AC 135</span> at 150 (“_Horrocks v Lowe_”), as approved in _Maidstone Pte Ltd v Takenaka Corp_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 752</span> (“_Maidstone_”) at \[48\]:

>> … In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognise the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be ‘honest’, that is, a positive belief that the conclusions that they have reached are true. The law demands no more.”

Further, at \[39\], \[40\] and \[43\] of _Gao Shuchao_, the High Court explained that:

> (a)     There is no malice where the defendant is merely careless, impulsive or irrational in believing the statement to be true. It has to be proven that the defendant knew that the defamatory statement was false or was “reckless to the point of wilful blindness” for malice to be found.

> (b)     The high threshold for finding malice is in line with the rationale underpinning the privilege, _ie_, that the defendant has a moral, social or legal duty to disclose the information and the recipient has an interest in receiving it. A defendant should not be penalised for making an honest mistake, where he published statements that he genuinely believed to be true.

> (c)     Evidence of a defendant’s conduct and action prior to the publication of a defamatory statement, at the time of the publication and after the publication including the entire surrounding circumstances, must be viewed in totality in determining whether there was malice.

94     It is trite that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove malice. In the plaintiff’s reply, he pleaded[^36] the following matters as particulars of malice on the part of the defendant:

> (a)     making the Complaint falsely alleging that the plaintiff had acted in his capacity as advocate and solicitor despite knowing that he was acting as honorary secretary of the MC;

> (b)     consistently finding fault with the plaintiff including questioning the plaintiff’s mandate to represent the MC in the KF suit;

> (c)     attending the hearing of the KF suit, and seeking information from the MCST's lawyer which she was not authorised to receive;

> (d)     together with “members of her camp”, deliberately disrupting the MA and the plaintiff from carrying out their functions by sending approximately between 600 to 1,200 emails each to the MA and the plaintiff some of which were in breach of the Code of Conduct and Declaration of Non-Disclosure as well as the Practice Directions agreed by the MC;

> (e)     deliberately harassing the plaintiff / MA with frivolous requests for information on account of the plaintiff being the honorary secretary and in the Security and Landscape Sub-committees when she was at all times aware that she could make a formal application in accordance with the provisions of the BMSMA;

> (f)     refusing to attend an emergency meeting called by the chairperson to settle the unnecessary disputed issue in the Minutes of the MC meeting on 14 September 2016 relating to the mandate given to the Plaintiff in the KF case;

> (g)     refusing to reply to the plaintiff’s email seeking clarification on her alleged interference in court in seeking confidential information from MCST's lawyers pending the negotiations of a settlement in the KF suit on 26 September 2016;

> (h)     refusing to reply to the plaintiff’s email seeking clarification on her alleged defamatory remarks in her email dated 25 October 2016 (which was the subject matter in DC 594); and

> (i)     having a hand in sending out malicious and false anonymous flyers (poison pen letters) on 3 November 2016 to all the subsidiary proprietors to attack the plaintiff prior to the EOGM and to cause alarm to all the subsidiary proprietors on the state of the sinking fund, security and landscape matters in the condominium.

95     The plaintiff pleaded further that the defendant's dominant motive in making the Complaint was to malign and discredit him in the eyes of his peers in the legal profession.

#### Making complaint falsely that plaintiff had acted in his capacity as advocate and solicitor despite knowing that he was acting as honorary Secretary

96     The defendant gave evidence that she made the complaint as she perceived from her interactions with the plaintiff that he was using his status as lawyer to put down and bully other MC members. She had read from the Law Society’s website that any member of the public could make a complaint against a lawyer even where there was no solicitor-client relationship. Her motive in laying the complaint to the Law Society was to bring to their attention the plaintiff’s threatening and intimidating conduct which was not of the standard expected of a lawyer. The following extract[^37] from her cross-examination is pertinent:

> Q    Right. Whatever the reason, Ms. Teoh, if you were unhappy with the way Mr. Gopalan was doing his duties as an---as a Honorary Secretary, you have a lot of remedies that you could have chosen, right? You could have, for example, move the resolution to remove him as council and then call the AGM to re---EOGM to remove him just like Ms. ‘Tan’ was removed, right? You could have done that.

> A    Can I explain why I did not do that?

> …

> Q    Why?

> A    Because for me, it’s his conduct as a lawyer. So, that is why I thought in my opinion, Law Soc is the avenue where I can make a complaint against a lawyer whose conduct is below the standard expected of.

> Q    Alright. Anyway, I put it to you that if you really were dissatisfied with his duty as a Honorary Secretary---

> A    No. It’s his---

> Q    not---not---wait---

> A    his---

> Q    let me finish.

> A    conduct as a lawyer, Mr.---

> Q    not---

> A    Bajwa.

> Q    letting---no, not letting you see the minutes, right? Not giving you confidential information, resisting all your---whatever you want. You could have done, according to the law, a resolution that the---at the council level and then that the AGM to get rid of him, correct?

> A    No, Mr. Bajwa, I disagree. Because to me, his conduct as a lawyer. To me, it’s not of a standard that is expected of a lawyer who uses his status to intimidate and to threaten.

97     The defendant had made the Complaint as she had an issue with the manner that the plaintiff had conducted himself. She hoped that the Law Society could put a stop to his intimidating ways. That was her dominant motive. It was not to malign and discredit him in the eyes of his peers as counsel for the plaintiff had contended.

98     She had read the contents of the Law Society’s website[^38] before making the Complaint which fell within the general rubric of “professional misconduct” in s 85(1) of the LPA. The plaintiff had also conceded during cross-examination[^39] that the bounds of professional misconduct were not circumscribed in the website. The defendant had given an explanation for each of the four heads of the Complaint. It could not, therefore, be regarded as irrational or reckless as to amount to malice even though the Law Society’s Review Committee had dismissed it entirely.

#### Consistently finding fault with the plaintiff including questioning the plaintiff’s mandate to represent the MC in the KF suit

99     There is no elaboration in the plaintiff’s AEIC as to how the defendant was consistently finding fault with him. In relation to questioning his mandate to represent the MCST in the KF suit, this issue had been canvassed in DC 594. In the email exchanges on the minutes of the fifth MC meeting and sixth MC meeting, the defendant was not challenging the plaintiff’s mandate. As I had found, the issue discussed in the emails circulating to the MC members and the MA was the accuracy of the minutes. With regard to the fifth MC meeting on 14 September 2016, I had found that there was no mention of an extended mandate given to the plaintiff and the MA to represent the MCST at the trial. The accuracy of the minutes was a concern raised not just by the defendant but other MC members as well.

100    The plaintiff’s AEIC had cited the defendant’s antagonism, aggressive and hostile attitude and sarcastic emails sent by the defendant. As I had found in DC 594, an examination of the email exchanges shows that the plaintiff had been equally, if not more, guilty of the same. The emails which he sent included a challenge to sue him, described her as someone with a “penchant for wasting time” and accused her of making “thoughtless comments”. In any case, the court has to be guided by the ruling in _Gao Shuchao_ at \[44\] and \[53\] that an antagonistic tone, rudeness and even a refusal to apologise, without more, is insufficient to prove malice.

#### Attending the hearing of the KF suit, and seeking information from the MCST's lawyer which she was not authorised to receive

101    The defendant had explained in her AEIC in DC 594 that when she attended court on the day of trial, it was Mr Ronnie Tan who had of his own volition spoken to her after Rickey Choo, the MA’s representative, introduced them. She had gone to observe the court proceedings which she understood were open to the public. Her testimony was not challenged in cross-examination.

102    In any case, as it turned out, the MCST’s lawyer had to speak to each of the MC members on the day of trial to obtain a fresh mandate for settlement. The allegation that the defendant’s communications with the lawyer amounted to malice has no basis.

#### Deliberately disrupting/harassing the plaintiff and the MA from carrying out their functions by requests for information and sending numerous emails

103    The plaintiff alleged as an instance of malice that the defendant and members of her camp had deliberately disrupted him and the MA from carrying out their functions by sending approximately 600 to 1,200 emails each to the MA and to him. This was a gross exaggeration unsupported by the evidence.

104    The defendant had sought a specific discovery order for the “600 to 1,200 emails” pleaded by the plaintiff. Pursuant to the order, the plaintiff disclosed 576 emails. During cross-examination, the plaintiff had first identified Amy Chan and Tan as members of the defendant’s camp. When confronted with the emails in the Agreed Bundles, he then widened the defendant’s camp to include other MC members. This effectively included all the seven new members of the sixth MC. A perusal of the Agreed Bundles showed that they comprised all the emails exchanged among the council members over a period of time on various operational issues in the estate. The plaintiff could not explain how these emails were deliberately disruptive. The defendant was not the sole author of the emails. They contained various threads of discussion and served as the communication channel for the MC members. I failed to see how they could be attributed as malice on the part of the defendant.

#### Not replying to the plaintiff’s emails of 28 September 2016 and 26 October 2016 seeking clarification / information, not wanting to attend emergency meeting

105    No elaboration was given by the plaintiff in his AEIC as to how the defendant’s omission to reply to his two emails amounted to malice.

106    The email that the plaintiff sent on 28 September 2016 was in fact addressed to the chairperson, Alice Ng, and not to the defendant. It was part of the chain of emails starting with the email which the defendant had sent to Mr Ronnie Tan and copied the MC members after she returned home from the court on the day of trial of the KF suit as she had explained in her AEIC in DC 594. In his email, the plaintiff had questioned the defendant’s presence in court and communication with Ronnie Tan as undermining the mandate given to him to represent the MCST. As it turned out, the defendant, as a member of the MC, had to give consent to the settlement which she did after her conversation with Ronnie Tan that day. The defendant had already apprised all the MC members of her attendance in court. It was puzzling why a further clarification was needed from the defendant, and how her omission to do so when the email was not directed specifically to her could be regarded as malice.

107    As to the second email dated 26 October 2016, this was sent by the plaintiff in response to the defendant’s defamatory email of 25 October 2016 in which she had taken objection to the minutes of the MC meeting. The defendant had given a valid explanation in DC 594 as to why she did not respond to the plaintiff. I had found in DC 594 that the plaintiff had read the defendant’s defamatory email out of context.

108    The emergency meeting called by the chairperson after the defendant’s email of 25 October 2016 did not materialise as most of the MC members were unavailable.

109    Considering the caustic and derisory language directed at the defendant that the plaintiff had used in his emails at the material time, I fail to understand how the defendant’s lack of response to the plaintiff’s email of 26 October 2016 or her not wanting to attend the emergency meeting called by the chairperson could be seen as malice.

#### “Poison pen letter”

110    What the plaintiff described as the “poison pen letter” was a flyer[^40] that had been sent to all subsidiary proprietors of Casa Merah on 3 November 2016 just before the EOGM on 5 November 2016. He believed that the defendant had a role in it and that it was meant to attack him prior to the EOGM. However, no direct evidence was adduced to implicate the defendant. From the cross-examination of the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s allegation was not substantiated.

111    The flyer made no mention of the plaintiff[^41]. The issues raised in the flyer included rats and termite infestation, dying trees, poor maintenance of the landscape, payment for security guards, the managing agent’s performance of duties, and the expenditure of the MCST’s funds including the provisions made for the KF suit. Except for the KF suit for which the plaintiff had a specific mandate, the other matters would fall within the purview of the different sub-committees and the council as a whole. On the issues touching on landscaping and security, the plaintiff was not the sole person on those sub-committees. It is a reasonable conclusion that the plaintiff’s suspicion of the defendant was borne out of his personal hostility and dislike of the defendant.

#### Malice not proven

112    The defendant had made the Complaint as she believed that the Law Society was the avenue for her to raise her grievances on the plaintiff’s conduct. Her belief was premised on what she had read on the Law Society’s website. She had provided detailed particulars of each head of her complaint and believed them to be true. The evidence adduced before me does not show that the defendant was actuated by such improper motives in making the Complaint as to deprive her of the protection of privilege.

### If the defendant is liable in defamation, what is the appropriate award of damages that ought to be made to the plaintiff?

113    The issue of damages does not arise since I have found that the defendant has succeeded in her defence of qualified privilege.

## Conclusion

114    The defendant’s Complaint to the Law Society contained words which were defamatory of the plaintiff. The Complaint was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. The plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the Complaint was actuated by malice. He failed to discharge that burden. In the result, the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.

115    I shall hear parties on costs.
