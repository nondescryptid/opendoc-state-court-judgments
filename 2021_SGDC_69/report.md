Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Attorney-General – Powers

Companies – Schemes of arrangement – Moratorium

9 April 2021 - Judgment reserved

### District Judge Clement Julien Tan Tze Ming:

1       The defendant company, Libra Group Limited (“LGL”) faces three charges for failing to pay the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) contributions of its employees, offences under Section 58(b) of the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap. 36) (the “CPF Act”). On 17 September 2019, LGL applied for moratorium protection under the now-repealed Section 211B of the Companies Act (Cap. 50, 2006 Rev. Ed.) (“Section 211B CA”), to pursue debt-restructuring by way of a scheme of arrangement. The High Court granted the moratorium order on 14 October 2019, for a period of six months. Subsequent orders were made to extend the duration of the moratorium order. As at the date of this judgment, the moratorium order remains in force.

2       LGL was first charged for the CPF offences on 2 July 2020. From the outset, LGL’s position was that these proceedings fall within the ambit of the moratorium in Section 211B(1)(c) of the Companies Act. Therefore, the CPF Board (“CPFB”) ought to have been precluded from commencing or continuing these proceedings in breach of the moratorium. CPFB takes a contrary position, maintaining that the proceedings can continue. Originally, the hearing was fixed on the basis that LGL was seeking a stay of these proceedings, on account of the moratorium. However, in its written submissions, LGL instead sought the withdrawal of the CPF charges or the adjournment of the proceedings until the restructuring of the company is completed. Either way, this judgment seeks to address the issue of whether criminal proceedings fall within the ambit of the moratorium in Section 211B(1)(c) of the Companies Act.

3       I answer this issue in the negative. Applying the rules of statutory interpretation, it would appear that Section 211B(1)(c) CA should be interpreted widely to cover criminal proceedings. However, doing so would result in a clear conflict with Article 35(8) of the Constitution in which case, the latter must be given primacy. I will elaborate below.

## Interpretation of Section 211B(1)(c) of the Companies Act

4       The now-repealed Section 211B(1) CA provides as follows:-

> **Power of Court to restrain proceedings, etc., against company**

> **211B.** – (1)    Where a company proposes, or intends to propose, a compromise or an arrangement between the company and its creditors or any class of those creditors, the Court may, on the application of the company, make one or more of the following orders, each of which is in force for such period as the Court thinks fit:

>> (a)    an order restraining the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the company;

>> (b)    an order restraining the appointment of a receiver or manager over any property or undertaking of the company;

>> (**c**)     **an order restraining the commencement or continuation of any proceedings (other than proceedings under this section or section 210, 211D, 211G, 211H or 212) against the company, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;**

>> (d)    an order restraining the commencement, continuation or levying of any execution, distress or other legal process against any property of the company, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;

>> (e)    an order restraining the taking of any step to enforce any security over any property of the company, or to repossess any goods held by the company under any chattels leasing agreement, hire-purchase agreement or retention of title agreement, except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes;

>> (f)    an order restraining the enforcement of any right of re-entry or forfeiture under any lease in respect of any premises occupied by the company (including any enforcement pursuant to section 18 or 18A of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap. 61)), except with the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as the Court imposes.

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

5       It remains unsettled as to whether criminal proceedings fall within the ambit of Section 211B(1)(c) CA. The phrase “any proceedings” is not defined in the Companies Act. There are also no reported decisions on this issue.

6       That being the case, the scope of Section 211B(1)(c) CA falls to be determined in accordance with the established principles of statutory interpretation. Statutory interpretation is a purposive endeavour, in that an interpretation that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law must be preferred to an interpretation that would not do so: Section 9A(1) Interpretation Act (Cap.1, 2002 Rev. Ed.) (see also _Re IM Skaugen SE and other matters_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 979</span> at \[27\] (“_Re IM Skaugen_”)). The three-step approach to purposive interpretation is that as laid down by the Court of Appeal in _Tan Cheng Bock v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 850</span> (“_Tan Cheng Bock_”) at \[38\] to \[54\], and summarised in _Re IM Skaugen_ (above) as follows:

> (a)     First, a court should ascertain the possible interpretations of the provision in question, by determining the ordinary meaning of the words in the provision, aided by rules and canons of statutory construction.

> (b)     Second, a court should then ascertain the legislative purpose of the provision and the part of the statute in which the provision is situated. In this regard, it may be necessary to consider the specific purpose of the particular provision in question, although it should be presumed that a statute is coherent as a whole, such that its individual provisions should as far as possible be read consistently with both the specific purpose of the provision and the general purpose of the underlying statute (_Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[40\]-\[41\]). In ascertaining the legislative purpose, extraneous material may be a useful aid to interpretation, but primacy must be accorded to the text of the provision and its statutory context (_Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[43\]); hence, extraneous material should not contradict the express text of the provision except in very limited circumstances (_Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[50\]).

> (c)     Third, a court should compare the possible interpretations of the provision against the purpose of the relevant provision and prefer the interpretation which furthers the purpose of the written text (_Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[54(c)\].

7       Applying the principles of statutory interpretation, I find that there are compelling reasons why Section 211B(1)(c) CA should be read to include criminal proceedings. First, on its plain and natural meaning, “any proceedings” should be given an expansive construction to cover all judicial proceedings, civil and criminal. In this regard, it has been held that quasi-judicial proceedings such as arbitration proceedings also fall within the ambit of Section 211B(1)(c) CA (see _Re IM Skaugen_ at \[86\]). Second, parliament had specifically identified certain proceedings that are to be excluded from the scope of Section 211B(1)(c) CA. These are proceedings that may be brought against the company under Sections 210, 211B, 211D, 211G, 211H and 212. If parliament had intended a similar carve-out for criminal proceedings, it could have stated so expressly. It did not do so. Third, at various instances in the Companies Act, the draftsman had used the words “civil proceedings” (see for e.g., Sections 216, 383 CA) and “criminal proceedings” (see for e.g., Sections 8H(1)(a), 172B CA), depending on which particular category of proceedings was being referred to in the provision in question. If Section 211B(1)(c) CA was intended to be limited to civil proceedings, the provision would have referred to “civil proceedings” as opposed to “any proceedings”. In fact, there are instances where the draftsman had used the words “any proceedings” to compendiously include both criminal and civil proceedings (see for example, Sections 208A and 386AO CA). Fourth, I find no reason for reading down the phrase “any proceedings” to mean only civil proceedings. The _ejusdem generis_ rule has no application in this specific context.

8       I turn now to consider the legislative objective behind Section 211B(1)(c) CA. This was explained by Mr. Edwin Tong SC, a member of the ILR Committee and Restructuring Committee during the second reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (10 March 2017) vol 94), as follows:

> The moratorium is crucial because it suspends actions against a debtor company. Without a moratorium, a scramble usually takes place when creditors think that someone else is going to steal a march on them, and consequently everyone moves in to liquidate the company. This undermines any prospect of being able to reach a more beneficial arrangement. It drives a company towards litigation and ultimately kills value in the company. In contrast, a moratorium holds the line and keeps all creditors on an even keel. This is vital, so that companies in distress can have some ‘breathing space’ in order to put in place an effective and mutually beneficial rescue plan.

9       In _Re IM Skaugen_ at \[42\], Kannan Ramesh J summarised the legislative purpose of Section 211B of the Companies Act, as follows:

> An applicant was allowed a default 30-day breathing space – the Automatic Stay – which could be extended on terms if the s 211B(1) application was allowed, and thereafter for further periods also on terms, in order to either develop and propose a restructuring plan, or if one had been proposed, to refine and mature it based on engagement with the relevant creditor community, with the end objective in both situations being a vote on the plan at a scheme meeting if one was ordered under s 210(1).

10     Later in the judgment at \[83\], the Honourable Judge further noted that although the moratorium in Section 211B(1) CA “_is primarily for the benefit of the debtor in enabling it to pursue its restructuring efforts without the constant threat of litigation, it also protects the interests of creditors generally by precluding certain creditors from acting unilaterally in self-interest to obtain payment from a debtor to the detriment of other creditors_”.

11     With these policy objectives in mind, I am obligated under Section 9A(1) of the Interpretation Act to prefer the expansive construction of Section 211B(1)(c) CA (which covers criminal proceedings) to the narrower construction (which does not cover criminal proceedings), as it is the former which “_promote\[s\] the purpose or object underlying the written law_”. In my view, there is no question that criminal proceedings brought against a company would distract it from its restructuring efforts. It would be an encroachment into the ‘breathing space’ that the moratorium is meant to provide. Furthermore, in most cases where a corporate entity is convicted of a crime, the typical sanction would be a fine. An unpaid fine could trigger the issuance of an order of attachment against the property of the company: Section 319(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Procedure Code. This only adds to the financial woes of the company that is already in distress and scuppers any potential arrangement that the company has with its creditors.

12     In this regard, the prosecution sought to draw a distinction between (a) the prosecution of a company for criminal offences which, on conviction, may result in a fine and/or other statutory payments being imposed on the accused company, and (b) the enforcement or recovery of these fines and/or statutory payments.[^1] The prosecution submitted that the effect of a Section 211B moratorium only relates to the latter. I do not agree that such a distinction matters. An analogy could be drawn with civil claims – (a) a claim under a cause of action which, if liability is found, may result in damages being awarded and/or costs orders made, and (b) the enforcement or recovery of the award of damages and/or such costs orders. In the context of a civil claim, there is no question that both the bringing of the claim, whether in court or other quasi-judicial settings, and the recovery and enforcement of the judgments or orders made thereunder, fall within the scope of the Section 211B moratorium. The same reasoning should therefore apply in the context of criminal prosecutions.

13     Finally, the defence referred to the Parliamentary Debates on the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 and the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Bill (the “IRD Bill”), contending that Parliament had clearly intended for the moratorium to cover all proceedings, including criminal proceedings. Conversely, the prosecution objected to the use of the Parliamentary Debates in interpreting Section 211B(1)(c) CA. The prosecution submitted, in the main, that the use of such extraneous material did not meet the requirements laid down in _Tan Cheng Bock v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 850</span> at \[54\] (“_Tan Cheng Bock_”).

14     I agree with the prosecution’s submissions. I found the Parliamentary Debates, at least the extracts that were brought to my attention, to be of no assistance.

15     The defence relied on the following excerpts taken from the second reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (10 March 2017) vol. 94):-

> **Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (West Coast)**:

> …

> What happens when rehabilitation efforts fail? I will focus on two pressing concerns. First, when workers are not paid their salaries while the company undergoes rehabilitation; and second, the impact on workers’ salary claims when rehabilitation efforts fail and the company is wound up.

> First, statutory moratoriums and impact on workers’ salary claims. In our existing judicial management regime, the making of the judicial management order brings into force, no other proceedings or legal process shall be commenced or continued against the company except with the consent of the judicial manager or with leave of the court. The policy intent behind the institution of the statutory moratorium makes good sense and many jurisdictions have in place similar regimes. It allows the company to continue its business with reprieve from creditors while it attempts to nurse itself back to financial health or to achieve a more advantageous realisation of the company’s assets than would be effected on a winding up.

> The statutory moratorium is clearly geared to the interest of the company in distress and the ambit of the moratorium has been interpreted in a purposive manner to include processes initiated whether in court or by way of arbitration or a step in such process. **This would presumably extend to criminal proceedings and quasi-legal proceedings such as the bringing of trade disputes to the Industrial Arbitration Court.**

> ..

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had stated that they were unable to assist employees of a firm under judicial management as MOM was not able to inquire into salary claims of employees covered under the Employment Act while the statutory moratorium was in force, except with the consent of the judicial manager or with the leave from the High Court.

> …

> First, an exception to the statutory moratorium could be made for MOM to be allowed to investigate and take action against companies for unlawful labour practices under the Employment Act while the moratorium is in place without having to seek the consent of the judicial manager or leave of Court. By the same token, there should also be an exception to allow Unions to refer their industrial disputes to the Industrial Arbitration Court during the moratorium without the need of leave of Court nor the judicial manager’s consent.

> **Ms Indranee Rajah**:

> …

> With respect to this set of amendments on restructuring, Mr Tay asked a question of whether or not you could exempt employee claims from the moratorium. But I think that would defeat the purpose of a moratorium. See, with restructuring, what you are really trying to do is: the company is in trouble, it is bleeding, it has got a problem. You are trying to give it breathing space where it is kind of like a “time out”. And the “time out” enables you, hopefully, to get in rescue financing or to see how to restructure it so that it can continue as a going concern.

> If it is done well and one properly, then these employees, hopefully, will be able to get their salaries and continue to hold on to their jobs. The difficulty of exempting them from a moratorium is that just as you are talking to somebody who is prepared to give you rescue financing, then suddenly an employee claim comes and then another group of employee claims comes. And the management is trying to fight and hold off these claims as you are talking with the people who are going to put in financing. It does not enable the management to focus on getting the company back on its feet. So, the restructuring context is slightly different and the whole idea of the moratorium is to give the company time to take stock of all the different debts and try to get it back on its feet, hopefully, for the betterment of all the creditors including the employees and have the employees continue in employment.

16     In my view, the passages from the second reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 do not shed any light on the issue at hand. It is quite clear that the passages were concerned with employees’ salary claims and Mr. Patrick Tay had prefaced his speech as such. While Mr. Patrick Tay remarked that he presumed criminal proceedings were also caught by Section 211B(1)(c) CA, that was all it was. It was not an unequivocal statement and it received no confirmation or support from the other parliamentarians, in particular, the Minister who moved the motion for the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017 to be read a second time in Parliament. It can hardly be said to be representative of the “_collective will and intent of Parliament_” (see _Tan Cheng Bock_ at \[113\]). Regrettably, this may have been a missed opportunity to clarify this area of law. However, considering the issues raised by Mr. Tay were in the wider context of employees’ salary claims, it is understandable that the thrust of Ms. Rajah’s response was to address that very issue.

17     In _Tan Cheng Bock_, the Court of Appeal laid down principles on the use of extraneous material to aid in the construction of statutes pursuant to Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1, 2002 Rev. Ed.), and the weight to be accorded to such extraneous material. The Court of Appeal held, at \[54(iii)-(iv)\], that:

> (iii)  Consideration of extraneous material may only be had in three situations:

>> (A)    If the ordinary meaning of the provision (taking into account its context in the written law and purpose or object underlying the written law) is clear, extraneous material can only be used to confirm the ordinary meaning but not to alter it.

>> (B)    If the provision is ambiguous or obscure on its face, extraneous material can be used to ascertain the meaning of the provision.

>> (C)    If the ordinary meaning of the provision (taking into account its context in the written law and the purpose or object underlying the written law) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, extraneous material can be used to ascertain the meaning of the provision.

> (iv)  In deciding whether to consider extraneous material, and if so what weight to place on it, the court should have regard to the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the written law and the purpose or object underlying the written law); and the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage. The court should also have regard to (A) whether the material is clear and unequivocal; (B) whether it discloses the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention underlying the statutory provision; and (C) whether it is directed to the very point of statutory interpretation in dispute.

18     Having regard to the principles laid down in _Tan Cheng Bock_, I decline to consider the Parliamentary Debates in respect of the second reading of the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2017, for the reasons as set out in \[16\] above.

19     I reach the same conclusion in respect of the Parliamentary Debates on the IRDB. Section 211B of the Companies Act was repealed and re-enacted as Section 64 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act (“IRDA”). I accept the defence’s contention that consideration of the Parliamentary Debates on the IRDB could be relevant in ascertaining Parliament’s intention on account that Section 211B CA has been reaffirmed by way of its re-enactment in Section 64 of the IRDA. However, I found nothing in the Parliamentary Debates for the second reading of the IRDB that directly addressed the issue at hand. For completeness, the defence relied on the following excerpt (second reading of the IRDB (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (1 October 2018) Vol. 94):

> Mr Patrick Tay:

> …

> For example, in February 2015, Vela Diagnostics came under judicial management in Singapore. Staff were informed that they could not be paid until new funding from investors was secured. **MOM had stated that they were unable to assist employees for a firm under judicial management as the Assistant Commissioner for Labour at MOM was not able to inquire into salary claims of employees covered under the Employment Act while the statutory moratorium was in force, except with the consent of the judicial manager or with leave from the High Court**.

> …

> Finally, **there should also be exceptions to the statutory moratorium – MOM could be allowed to investigate and take action against unlawful labour practices under the Employment Act without having to seek the consent of the judicial manager or obtain leave of Court**. Unions should also be allowed to refer cases to the Industrial Arbitration Court for arbitration and not having to resort to industrial action.

> \[Emphasis in bold added by the defence\]

20     The defence submitted that the excerpt refers to “_criminal proceedings relating to employee claims_”, and it “_discloses Parliament’s intention to protect companies under moratoria from all proceedings, including criminal proceedings relating to employee claims_”.[^2] In my view, this submission is without basis. Arguably, Mr. Patrick Tay may, indeed, have been referring to criminal proceedings relating to employee claims. However, that was, at best, a proposal to expand the scope of the moratorium in the IRDB to include such proceedings. Unfortunately, this also received no endorsement or confirmation from the other MPs. Senior Minister of State for Law, Mr. Edwin Tong Chun Fai, who moved the motion for the second reading of the IRDB, confined his response to Mr. Tay’s speech to the manner in which employees’ claims for unpaid salaries are dealt with in a restructuring scenario and an insolvent liquidation scenario.

21     Undoubtedly, there is a tension between two competing interests, namely, the enforcement of criminal law on the one hand and, on the other, the protection of debtor companies and their creditors during restructuring. In my view, there may be good reasons for according primacy to the latter policy objective in the present instance. Whilst the criminal law is intended to protect the public by punishing miscreants and advancing its objectives such as deterrence and retribution, these objectives are somewhat more muted where companies, being the product of legal fiction, are concerned. Public opprobrium arising from corporate wrongdoing tends to be directed more at the individuals and actors responsible for the criminal acts (for example, the directors or employees of the company), rather than the company itself. In this respect, the moratorium in Section 211B CA does not preclude the bringing of criminal proceedings against such individuals. Furthermore, imposing a fine on a company that is already in financial distress can be likened to flogging a (nearly) dead horse, thereby calling into question the efficacy of the criminal law in such situations.

22     This is not the forum for delving into jurisprudential issues on whether corporate entities should attract criminal liability or the efficacy of imposing criminal sanctions on corporate entities. There is no question that criminal sanctions can achieve its objectives where corporate entities are concerned – for example, through the stigma and the negative impact on the company’s reputation following a conviction or where a fine is large enough to impact a company’s bottom-line – thereby disincentivising the company from further engaging in criminal behaviour. The point I make here is that there may be little to achieve in pursuing criminal proceedings against a company in distress. In any case, Section 211B(1)(c), if interpreted to include criminal proceedings, does not mean that no criminal proceedings can be brought at all. Rather, insofar as the company is being alleged of having committed a serious offence, this may well be a relevant consideration for the High Court when deciding if leave should be granted, but this is a separate issue altogether.

23     In sum, I agree with the defence’s position that Section 211B(1)(c) CA should be interpreted widely to include criminal proceedings. However, there remains one hurdle to surmount, which I will turn to now.

## Incompatibility between Section 211B(1)(c) CA and Article 35(8) of the Constitution

24     The prosecution submitted that all criminal prosecutions fall within the control and direction of the Attorney-General in his capacity as the Public Prosecutor: see Section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Rev. Ed.). The present proceedings, brought under the CPF Act, is no exception: see Section 67 of the CPF Act.[^3]

25     The prosecution further submitted that interpreting Section 211B(1)(c) CA to include criminal proceedings would thus result in an incompatibility with Article 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Rev. Ed. 1985, 1999 Reprint) (the “Constitution”), which provides as follows:

> The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.

26     This is because such an interpretation would “_effectively subject the commencement and/or continuance of criminal proceedings to the discretion of the judiciary, which is contrary to the constitutional power of the Attorney-General as expressly conferred under Art 35(8)_”.[^4] According to the prosecution, Article 4 of the Constitution further mandates that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land and ordinary legislation, such as the Companies Act, cannot be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with any of the Articles of the Constitution.

27     In _Law Society of Singapore v Tan Guan Neo Phyllis_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 239</span> (“_Phyllis Tan_”), a three-judge coram of the High Court considered the interplay between Articles 35(8) and 93 of the Constitution, and held at \[145\] that the Attorney-General has an unfettered discretion as to _when_ and _how_ the prosecutorial powers conferred by the Constitution are to be exercised, free from interference from the courts, save where the exercise of such power is unconstitutional. It bears reproducing the relevant excerpts of the holding, as follows:

> \[144\] …

> These two provisions expressly separate the prosecutorial function from the judicial function, and give equal status under the Constitution, and neither may interfere with each other’s functions or intrude into the powers of the other, subject only to the constitutional power of the court to prevent the prosecutorial power from being exercised unconstitutionally. Indeed, this is not even a true “interference” inasmuch as the exercise of a function unconstitutionally is, in effect, not an exercise of that function at all and which it is therefore the duty of the court (pursuant to the Constitution itself) to prevent.

> \[145\] In relation to public prosecutions, Art 35(8) makes it clear that the _institution, conduct or discontinuance_ of any criminal proceedings is a matter for only the Attorney-General to decide. **This means that, except for unconstitutionality, the Attorney-General has an unfettered discretion as to when and how he exercises his prosecutorial powers.** This also means that it is improper for the court to prevent the Attorney-General from prosecuting an offender by staying the prosecution …

> \[Emphasis in bold added\]

28     In _Lim Chit Foo v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 19</span> (“_Lim Chit Foo_”), the Court of Appeal affirmed this position at \[20\]:

> \[20\] … It is clear on the one hand that under Art 35(8) of the Constitution, it is the prerogative of the Attorney-General to “institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence”. This is echoed in s 11 of the CPC, which stipulates that the Attorney-General as Public Prosecutor shall “have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under \[the CPC\] or any other written law”. On the other hand, it is equally established that once charges have been brought before the court, criminal proceedings are subject to the overall supervision and control of the court.

29     I agree with the prosecution’s submissions. From the above-cited passage from _Lim Chit Foo_, criminal proceedings are instituted when charges are brought before the court. Once instituted, the court then has overall supervision and control of the proceedings. The crucial takeaway is that, until and unless criminal proceedings are _instituted_, vide the bringing of charges before the court, there can be no proceedings for the court to assume supervision and control over. There appears to be nothing in the Constitution that empowers the courts to restrain the Attorney-General from instituting criminal proceedings.

30     The effect of interpreting Section 211B(1)(c) CA to include criminal proceedings would be that no criminal proceedings can be instituted without first obtaining leave of court. This appears to be inconsistent with Article 35(8) of the Constitution since the Attorney-General ought to have unfettered discretion as to _when_ criminal proceedings are to be instituted. When a moratorium order is made by the High Court in accordance with Section 211B CA, and Section 211B(1)(c) CA is interpreted to include criminal proceedings, that would be tantamount to a restraining order on the Attorney-General from instituting criminal proceedings against the company unless leave of court is first obtained. This, in my view, clearly represents an erosion of the Attorney-General’s constitutional powers as the key to instituting criminal proceedings is handed over to the courts.

31     Citing \[22\] of _Lim Chit Foo_, the defence contended that the Attorney-General’s prerogative under Article 35(8) of the Constitution refers only to the “_decision and the discretion to initiate, maintain and terminate a criminal prosecution_”. The defence thus submits that even in situations where “_charges have not been brought before the Court, the Attorney-General’s decision to bring charges against any prospective defendant \[alone\] would mean that the prosecutorial discretion has been exercised_”. For completeness, \[22\] of _Lim Chit Foo_ is reproduced, as follows:

> Thus, even though the Attorney-General is said under Art 35(8) to have the power to “initiate, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence” it is clear that this refers to the decision and the discretion to initiate, maintain and terminate a criminal prosecution. It does not vest in the Attorney-General the power to determine how the proceedings as a whole, involving both the Prosecution and the Defence, will be managed and conducted. That, plainly, is a function and responsibility of the court.

32     I disagree with the defence’s reading of _Lim Chit Foo_. Such a reading robs the constitutional power conferred on the Attorney-General of any meaning. Article 35(8) of the Constitution expressly refers to, amongst other things, the Attorney-General’s power to institute criminal proceedings. The only way in which the Attorney-General can meaningfully exercise this power is by bringing charges before the court. In my view, the defence’s contention that this power merely equates to the making of a decision by the Attorney-General makes little sense. A decision by the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings can only be said to be taken or manifested when charges are brought before the court. Anything short of that would be pointless.

33     In my view, \[22\] of _Lim Chit Foo_ has to be read in its entirety and in context. I do not think the Court of Appeal intended that as ascribed by the defence. Rather, the Court of Appeal’s focus was on the interpretation of the phrase “_initiate, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence_” found in Article 35(8) of the Constitution and, in particular, on the scope of the Attorney-General’s powers in the conduct of criminal proceedings. My view is fortified by the fact that the key issue that the Court of Appeal had to grapple with in _Lim Chit Foo_ was whether the practice of standing down (or adjourning the prosecution of certain) charges was a matter within the prosecutorial direction of the Public Prosecutor or the exercise of judicial power under Article 93 of the Constitution. This is an issue pertaining to the _conduct_ of criminal proceedings. The Court of Appeal’s point in \[22\] of _Lim Chit Foo_ was essentially this. It is for the Attorney-General to decide when to initiate, press on or terminate criminal proceedings. But once charges are before the court and proceedings are afoot, the management, overall supervision and conduct of proceedings would be within the court’s domain. This is consistent with the decision in _Phyllis Tan_.

34     There were several cases that were brought to my attention. These cases concerned the scope of moratoriums in restructuring or insolvency regimes in other jurisdictions. _Biosource Technologies Incorporated v Axis Genetics Plc (in administration)_ \[2000\] 1 BCLC 286; _In re Rhondda Waste Disposal Ltd_ \[2001\] Ch 57 (“_Re Rhondda Waste_”); _In the matter of Frankice (Golders Green) Limited Hudson and Ors v The Gambling Commission_ \[2010\] EWHC 1229 (Ch); _Burwood Council v Pan Pac Investments Pty Ltd (No.2)_ \[2019\] NSWLEC 29; _Cowie v Perth Demolition Co Pty Ltd_ \[2019\] WASC 476; _P. Mohanraj & Ors v Shah Brothers Ispat Pvt Ltd_ (2021) ibclaw.in 24 SC (“_P. Mohanraj_”) where the Indian Supreme Court held that the moratorium in Section 14 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 includes criminal proceedings, overruling an earlier decision by the Bombay High Court in _Tayal Cotton Pvt Ltd v The State of Maharashtra & Ors_ (2019) 1 Mah LJ 312.

35     These cases, unfortunately, provide little assistance in the present instance. This is chiefly because the courts in these cases were not confronted with a constitutional argument as was raised in the present case. The cases largely turned on the interpretation of the legislation in question. Furthermore, whilst the underlying rationale of the moratoria in the other jurisdictions is largely similar to that in Section 211B CA, the wording and structure of the various legislation differ. This alone behoves me to regard the interpretation approaches taken by the courts in those cases with circumspection. If anything, the decisions in _Re Rhondda Waste_ and _P. Mohanraj_ would appear to lend some support to my interpretation of Section 211B(1)(c) CA, as set out above.

36     Accordingly, notwithstanding my views on the manner in which Section 211B(1)(c) CA should be interpreted, I find the constitutional argument raised by the prosecution to be dispositive of the issue that I had set out to address. Section 211B(1)(c) CA cannot be interpreted in a manner which impinges on the Attorney-General’s constitutional power to institute, maintain or terminate criminal proceedings. LGL’s application for a stay of these proceedings is therefore without basis and dismissed. I would allow CPFB to proceed with the current proceedings against LGL.

37     As regards LGL’s alternative submission that the proceedings be adjourned until its restructuring is completed or upon the expiry moratorium, there is no question that the adjournment of proceedings pertains to the conduct of proceedings which falls within the court’s exercise of its powers. There may be some force to this submission, considering the present context where the commission of the offences, being LGL’s failure to pay its employees CPF contributions, are inextricably intertwined with its financial plight. However, this falls outside the scope of this judgment and is to be addressed separately pursuant to Section 238(1) of the CPC.
