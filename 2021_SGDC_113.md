\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/RAS 14/2021.\]

22 June 2021

### District Judge Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       The present appeal arose out of DC/SUM 148/2020 filed in DC 589/2020 (the “**Suit**”), which is the Defendant’s application to stay the Suit commenced by the Plaintiffs before the District Court on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_. The learned Deputy Registrar (“**DR**”) allowed the application and stayed the Singapore action in favour of the Malaysian courts. The Plaintiffs appealed against the DR’s decision by way of a Registrar’s Appeal under Order 55B of the Rules of Court (“**ROC**”). I heard the Registrar’s Appeal, and allowed the appeal as I was, among other things, of the view that Malaysia was not clearly the more appropriate for the dispute. The Defendant is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed the present appeal to the High Court under Order 55C of the ROC.

## Background Facts

### The Parties

2       The 1st Plaintiff, Kiran Global Alkali Sdn Bhd (“**KA**” or “**1st Plaintiff**”) is a company incorporated in Malaysia, and a subsidiary of Kiran Global Chems Limited (“**KGCL**”), a company incorporated in India. KGCL is the parent company of the Kiran group of companies (the “**Kiran group**”), which is in the business of manufacturing industrial chemicals, including sodium silicates. The Kiran group operates in a number of countries in the Middle East and Africa.

3       The 2nd Plaintiff, PTAL International FZE (“**PTAL**”) is a wholly owned subsidiary of KGCL, and is incorporated in the United Arab Emirates.

4       The founder of the KGCL is Mr. Manmohan Singh Jain (“**M.S. Jain**”). The CEO of KGCL is Mr. Fernando Rufus Navis Charles (“**Rufus**”). Both are based in India.

5       The Defendant is Mr Param Deep Singh, a businessman who has been involved in the trade of oils and oil seeds, and chemical trading for more than 30 years. M.S. Jain and the Defendant have been friends for more than 40 years, having known each other when they worked for a company in India, before the Defendant moved to Singapore in the 1980s.

6       In 2013, the Kiran group decided to expand into Southeast Asia. To that end, Kiran Global Chemicals Sdn Bhd (“**KGC**”) was incorporated under the laws of Malaysia on or around 2 April 2013.

7       In 2013, KGC encountered legal issues when it attempted to acquire certain land in Malaysia (the “**Earlier Land Transaction**”). KGC was concerned whether the seller was the true owner of the land, and eventually withdrew from the deal. The counterparty to the Earlier Land Transaction had then threatened to sue KGC for failing to conclude the deal.

8       The Defendant learnt of KGC’s troubles and offered to help KGC source for a suitable plot of land in Malaysia to set up a local office and factory to produce sodium silicates.

### The Land Deal

9       On or around 4 July 2013, the Defendant successfully secured a letter of offer for KGC to purchase another plot of land, namely a land in Tanjong Langsat, Plot PLO 208 (the “**Land**”). The seller was a Malaysian entity called Johor Corporation, and the total purchase price was RM 2,186,654 (the “**Land Deal**”).

10     The Letter of Offer (the “**Letter of Offer**”) issued by Johor Corporation to KGC provided for the payment of the initial 30% of the purchase price to Johor Corporation as follows:

> (a)     10% of the purchase price amounting to RM218,665.40 was to be paid within 2 weeks of the Letter of Offer, i.e. 18 July 2013;

> (b)     KGC was to execute the sale and purchase agreement within 1 month from the date of receipt of the 10% payment; and

> (c)     20% of the purchase price was to be paid upon signing of the sale and purchase agreement.

11     On 30 August 2013, the Kiran group transferred the sum of RM 218,665.40, being 10% of the purchase price, to the Defendant. According to the Plaintiff, KGC did not have a Malaysian bank account at that time. It was thus agreed with the Defendant that the Defendant would receive funds on behalf of KGC in the Defendant’s Singapore bank account, and thereafter make payment to Johor Corporation[^1]. Payment of the first 10% of the Purchase Price was duly effected by the Defendant to Johor Corporation.

12     As it turned out, the sale and purchase agreement was not executed by KGC on 30 September 2013 as envisaged under the Letter of Offer. According to the Plaintiffs, the delay in the execution of the sale and purchase agreement was occasioned by Kiran group’s concerns about potential lawsuits due to the Earlier Land Transaction which had surfaced around that time.

13     In view of the potential lawsuits affecting KGC, Kiran group eventually decided to incorporate a new company in Malaysia for future business transactions in Malaysia. Pursuant thereto, the 1st Plaintiff, KA, was incorporated on 9 January 2014. Defendant was made a director, as well as a one-third shareholder, of KA. Rufus was also appointed as a director of KA.

14     The plan was for KA to take over the operations of KGC, including the purchase of the Land from Johor Corporation. Johor Corporation was duly informed of this arrangement in or around February 2014[^2], and agreed to KGC’s request to change the name of the buyer from KGC to KA. [^3]

15     In or around March 2014, Johor Corporation sent fair copies of the sale and purchase agreement (the “**Sale and Purchase Agreement**”) to KGC. KGC did not execute the Sale and Purchase Agreement as the name of the purchaser was still reflected as KGC, and not KA as previously requested by KGC. It was not disputed that the 20% purchase price to be paid to Johor Corporation upon execution of the Sale and Purchase Agreement was not effected in March 2014.

### The Disputed Cash Transfer

16     At or around the same time, on 1 March 2014, a sum of US$150,000.00 (the “**Sum**”) was transferred by the 2nd Plaintiff, at the instructions of the KGCL, to the Defendant’s Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (“**OCBC**”) account in Singapore. The Sum forms the subject matter of the present dispute. The Plaintiffs’ case was that the Sum was intended for payment of the 20% payment price upon the execution of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. However, as the Sale and Purchase Agreement sent over by Johor Corporation in March 2014 still reflected KGC as the purchaser, it was decided by KA, upon consultation with the Defendant, that the payment of the 20% purchase price would be placed on hold pending the rectification of KA as the buyer under the Sale and Purchase Agreement. Defendant had informed M.S. Jain and Rufus that he would pay the Sum to Johor Corporation after the latter had corrected the error and reflected KA as the buyer under the agreement[^4].

17     The Defendant did not dispute that he received the Sum in his OCBC bank account in Singapore and thereafter withdrew it for his own use. His sole defence, however, was that the Sum was paid to him by way of salary for the work he had undertaken on behalf of the Kiran group in Malaysia. He claimed that at the time he was asked to assist M.S. Jain in Kiran group’s Malaysian venture, an agreement was reached between him and M.S. Jain whereby he would be paid a sum US$6,500.00 on a monthly basis as compensation for services rendered by him. The payments would commence with effect from April 2013[^5]. It was further agreed that once KGC became operational, the Defendant’s remuneration would increase to US$10,000 a month. The agreement was, however, not reduced into writing, and no documentary proof of the remuneration agreement was produced in these proceedings. Defendant contended that given his long-standing friendship with M.S. Jain, he had no reason to doubt that such an oral agreement would not be honoured.

18     The Plaintiffs admitted that it was agreed between M.S. Jain and the Defendant that he would be remunerated for his services to KA and/or KGC. However, the definitive terms of his remuneration or compensation were never formally discussed, much less, agreed. At any rate, the Sum was not intended to be applied in payment of the Defendant’s salary. Instead it was meant to effect payment of the 20% of the purchase price which would have become due once the draft Sale and Purchase Agreement sent by Johor Corporation in March 2014 had been signed. But for the fact that the Vendors had not rectified the name of the purchaser from KGC to KA, the Sale and Purchase Agreement would have been signed, and the 20% payment made, in March 2014.

## The Suit

19     On 26 February 2020, KA and PTAL caused a writ to be issued against Defendant before the Singapore courts (DC 589/2020 (the “**Suit**”)).

20     The claims by the 1st Plaintiff against the Defendant are for (i) breach of trust by misappropriating monies held on trust; (ii) breach of fiduciary duties by the Defendant as a director of KA, and (iii) unjust enrichment.

21     The claims by the 2nd Plaintiff against the Defendant are for (i) breach of trust by misappropriating monies held on trust and (ii) unjust enrichment.

## Defendant’s stay application

22     The Plaintiffs contended that the Defendant had, through his lawyers, requested additional time to file a Defence and to make without prejudice proposals to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs granted the Defendant the indulgence, and refrained from entering a judgment in default of defence against the Defendant. This point was not disputed by the Defendant.

23     However, instead of filing a defence or putting forward any without prejudice proposals, on 20 April 2020, the Defendant’s counsel filed the present application DC/SUM 1482/2020 (“**SUM 1482**”) to stay the Suit on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_ under Order 12, Rule 7(2) of the Rules of Court.

24     In SUM 1482, the Defendant argued that the Malaysia was the more appropriate forum for the trial of the present action. In view of the stay application, the Defendant did not file a Defence in these proceedings. It was, however, apparent from the Defendant’s affidavits filed in support of SUM 1482 that his sole defence was that the Sum was made to him as payment for alleged salaries and expenses owed to him.

## Hearing before the Deputy Registrar

25     SUM 1482 was first heard on 8 January 2021 before the learned Deputy Registrar (“**DR**”) who granted the application and stayed the Singapore action in favour of the Malaysian courts. The key reason relied upon by the DR in ordering the action be stayed in favour of Malaysia was that the Defendant had indicated that he wished to call witnesses from Johor Corporation to prove his case that the monies were paid to him as remuneration rather than by way of purchase monies for the transaction with Johor Corporation. The DR was of the view that it was too early for him to rule out the probative value of such evidence, and therefore the case ought to be heard in Malaysia where the Johor Corporation witnesses were located.

26     The learned DR recognised that if the stay of the Singapore action were allowed, part of the Plaintiffs’ claim (in particular, the unjust enrichment claims) would have been time barred in Malaysia. The DR further acknowledged that the Defendant “may well be utilising the stay application for tactical reasons”. That notwithstanding, he found that the Plaintiff ought to have considered this possibility when formulating their own litigation strategy, including by filing a protective writ in Malaysia upon the Defendant filing the stay application. The limitation period for the unjust enrichment claim in Malaysia was close to expiring, but had yet to expire at the time SUM 1482 was filed. Since the Plaintiffs had chosen not to file a protective writ in Malaysia, they were the “true authors of \[any resulting\] prejudice”.

27     Having found that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum, the DR proceeded to grant the Defendant’s application and stayed the Singapore action in favour of the Malaysian courts.

## The Registrar’s Appeal

28     The application came before me by way of a Registrar’s Appeal brought pursuant to Order 55B of the Rules of Court. The sole issue before me was whether the DR was right in staying the Singapore proceedings in favour of the Malaysia based on the principles of _forum non conveniens_.

29     Having considered the parties’ submissions, I was of the view that Malaysia was not _clearly_ the more appropriate for the trial of the substantive dispute in this matter. Even if it were, I was of the view that the justice of the case would warrant that a stay _not_ be granted. I accordingly allowed the appeal and dismissed the Defendant’s application to stay the Suit on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_.

30     As the Defendant has filed an appeal against my decision, I set out the full grounds of my decision below.

## The law

31     The applicable test for determining whether an action should be stayed on the grounds of forum non conveniens is well settled. The test is as laid down in _Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1987\] AC 460</span> (“_Spiliada_”), which has been affirmed in numerous local decisions, including the recent local Court of Appeal decision of _Rappo, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 265</span> (“_Rappo”_).

32     The test is applied in 2 stages: the court will “first determine whether, _prima facie_, there is some other available forum that is more appropriate for the case to be tried. If the court concludes that there is _prima facie_ a more appropriate alternative forum, the court will ordinarily grant a stay unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nonetheless not be granted” (_Rappo_ at \[68\]).

33     Under the first stage of the test, the Defendant, who is applying for the stay, has the burden of showing that Malaysia is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” than Singapore for the trial of the substantive dispute between the parties (_Rappo_ at \[69\]).

34     The Court of Appeal further cautioned that “it is the _quality_ of the connecting factors that is crucial in this analysis, rather than the quantity of factors on each side of the scale. Parties in modern commercial litigation are often well connected, with relational and business ties to many different jurisdictions. The task of the court in this context is not to draw up a balance sheet of _tenuous or insubstantial points of contact_ with different fora in the expectation that the jurisdiction with the largest number on its side prevails at the close of the analysis. Rather, _the search is for those incidences (or connections) that have_ the _most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute_” (_Rappo_ at \[70\]). _\[Emphasis added\]_

35     A non-exhaustive list of connecting factors which the court would consider in determining whether the alternate forum proposed was the more appropriate forum included: (i) the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses; (ii) the connections to relevant events and transactions; (iii) the applicable law to the dispute; (iv) the existence of proceedings elsewhere (_lis alibi pendens_); and (v) the “shape of the litigation”, which is a shorthand for the manner in which the claim and the defence had been pleaded: (_Rappo_ at \[71\]).

### Stage 1 of the Spiliada test

#### Personal connections of the parties and the witnesses

36     The Plaintiff’s claim was in essence based on breach of trust (arising either from an agency relationship, or from a breach of director’s fiduciary duties) and/or unjust enrichment.

37     The substantive dispute in the present case ultimately converged on the purpose for which the US$150,000 (the “**Sum**”) was transferred by the 2nd Plaintiff at M.S. Jain’s directions to the Defendant. Specifically, the issue to be determined was whether the intended purpose of the Sum was to: (i) effect payment to Johor Corporation pursuant to the Land Deal entered into by KA with Johor Corporation (as Plaintiffs contended), or (ii) to effect payment of remuneration due to the Defendant for services rendered to KGC and/or KA (as the Defendant contended).

38     Against this backdrop, it was, in my view, the discussions, understanding and agreements between the Defendant, M.S. Jain and Rufus on how the monies were to be applied that formed the critical evidence on which the outcome of the case would turn. The key witnesses who could shed light on the real purpose for which the Sum was transferred would necessarily be the Defendant, M.S. Jain, and Rufus, the parties who were directly privy to these discussions.

39     In this regard, it was not disputed that the Defendant is a Singapore resident. He is ordinarily resident in Singapore, and his assets are presumably substantially located in Singapore. M.S. Jain and Rufus, on the other hand, were Indian nationals resident in India, with no clear links with Malaysia. There were no issues as to the willingness and/or compellability of these three key witnesses to testify in the Singapore proceedings. As far as these three critical witnesses were concerned, the convenience of witnesses did not point towards Malaysia as being the more appropriate forum.

40     The Defendant, however, argued that certain Malaysian witnesses would need to be called in support of his defence that the monies were paid as part of his remuneration. In particular, the following witnesses would need to be called:

> (i)     Johor Corporation representatives, to testify that the Kiran group did not intend to execute the Sale and Purchase Agreement, and thus, no sums were due to be paid by KA to Johor Corporation, at the time the Sum was transferred to the Defendant in March 2014[^6];

> (ii)     Johor Corporation representatives, to establish the extent of the Defendant’s contributions leading up to the Land Deal; this, the Defendant contended, was relevant in establishing the Defendant’s entitlement to reimbursements and expenses and for work done so as to justify his remuneration[^7];

> (iii)     Johor Corporation’s lawyers, Azmi and Associates, to show that at the time of transfer, the contracting party had yet to be changed from KGC to KA, and therefore the “intention on KA’s part to make payment to Johor Corporation for the 20% purchaser price _had \[not arisen\]_ when the transfer was effected”[^8];

> (iv)     Johor Corporation’s lawyers, Azmi and Associates, to give testimony on the delay in the execution in the Sale and Purchase Agreement[^9];

> (v)     the company secretary of KA, in respect of the work done by the Defendant on behalf of KA and/or KGC[^10].

41     In _JIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 391</span>, the Court of Appeal held that a court hearing an application for a stay should not predetermine the witnesses the parties should call. However, the Court of Appeal also acknowledged that a defendant applying for a stay should not be permitted to assert without substantiation that it required foreign witnesses just to manufacture a connecting factor. The court noted at \[67\]:

> “We acknowledge, on the other hand, that a defendant applying for a stay _should not be permitted to assert, without substantiation, that it requires foreign witnesses because that would make it easy for defendants to manufacture a connecting factor. Our view was that a defendant should at least show that evidence from foreign witnesses is at least arguably relevant to its defence_.” _\[Emphasis added\]_

42     For the reasons discussed below, I am of the view that the Defendant had not shown that the Malaysian witnesses it wished to call were “arguably relevant” to establishing his defence. The requisite threshold had thus not been met.

43     As noted above, the crux of the dispute was the purpose for which the Sums were transferred to the Defendant’s account on 1 March 2014. The key witnesses who could shed light on this issue were the immediate parties to this arrangement, i.e. M.S. Jain, Rufus and Defendant. Any evidence from third parties such as Johor Corporation or Azmi and Associates appeared to me to be of very limited relevance.

44     In so far as Defendant wished to call Johor Corporation and Azmi and Associates to testify that the Sale and Purchase Agreement was _not_ signed in March 2014, and hence no payments were due to be paid on 1 March 2014, this fact was not even disputed. Rufus alluded to this fact in paragraph 20 of his first affidavit dated 11 August 2020. The Defendant confirmed the same at paragraphs 50-52 of his first affidavit dated 20 April 2020, namely that KA was waiting for the Sale and Purchase Agreement to be rectified to reflect KA as the purchaser before executing the agreement.

45     Defence Counsel submitted alternatively that it was the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiffs did not want to sign the contract as KGC had become uncertain of “whether it wished to continue with its business in Malaysia through KGC” due to the earlier land dispute[^11]. Further, the reason why KA took no steps to proceed with the purchase between February 2014 to August 2014 was because “KGCL had shelved the idea of setting up a factory and was intending to scale down its business in Malaysia” due to financial constraints and lack of financing. Instead of building a full plant to manufacture sodium silicate in Malaysia, KGCL would install a dissolving unit, and focus on the stock and sale of products manufactured in India and market locally in Malaysia[^12]. Defendant argued that Johor Corporation witnesses could testify as to KA’s reasons for not proceeding with the Sale and Purchase Agreement in or around March 2014.

46     I was not persuaded by the Defendant’s attempts to artificially elevate the importance of the Johor Corporation and Azmi and Associates witnesses in these proceedings, none of whom were particularised despite the Defendant’s avowed intention to call them. First, it is difficult to understand how Johor Corporation, a third party, would be privy to the internal discussions within KGCL and/or KA as to the Kiran group’s future directions or business plans in Malaysia. In none of the affidavits filed by the Defendant was it mentioned that these development plans were discussed with external parties like Johor Corporation or Azmi and Associates. For example, Johor Corporation’s letter of 17 August 2014 made no reference to the Kiran group’s development plans in Malaysia. Johor Corporation’s sole query to KGC in that correspondence was to find out why the Sale and Purchase Agreement was not executed despite a valid copy being despatched to KGC. Any suggestion that Johor Corporation or Azmi and Associates knew, or were in a position to testify as to the real reason why KA had delayed signing the Sale and Purchase Agreement, was entirely speculative and improbable.

47     Indeed, Rufus’ affidavit and Defendant’s affidavit suggested that Plaintiffs and Defendant were in fact _ad idem_ as to the real reason why the Plaintiffs did not sign the Sale and Purchase Agreement in March 2014. The non-execution of the agreement was not because of any plans to downscale operations in Malaysia, but rather because the name of the buyer had not been changed from KGC to KA in the Sale and Purchase Agreement yet as requested by KGC to Johor Corporation in February 2014.

48     Rufus’s first affidavit thus stated at \[19\]-\[20\]:

> “19.  Around 4 March 2014, PTAL International FZC (“PTAL) on behalf of KA made payment of USD 150,000.00 to \[Defendant\] …. This was in order to make payment of a tranche under which was immediately due upon signing the Sale and purchase Agreement which was issued pursuant to the Letter of Offer.

> 20.     _However, Johor Corporation had issued the draft Sale and Purchase Agreement between Johor Corporation and KGC, not KA. \[Defendant\] informed me and Jain that he would pay on this sum of USD 150,000.00 after Johor Corporation had corrected the error and issue the Sale and Purchase Agreement to KA instead_. As we trusted him, we said no more about this for the time being. I wish to highlight that PD Singh had been corresponding with Johor Corporation about this issue, as can be seen from the letter from Johor Corporation dated 17 August 2014 exhibited at page 54 of his affidavit …..” _\[Emphasis added\]_

49     The reasons set out in Defendant’s first affidavit as to why the Sale and Purchase Agreement sent over by Johor Corporation in March 2014 was not signed matched Rufus’ account. Defendant deposed at paragraphs \[48\] to \[52\] of his first affidavit:

> “48.  Thereafter _KGCL and/or KGC were reconsidering whether they wanted to complete the purchase of Land_. There were discussions about opening up about a plant in Poland as opposed to Malaysia. There were also discussions for me to enter into a joint-venture with KGC and expand operations in Malaysia and South-east Asia.

> 49.    Due to these discussions, the payment schedule as set out in the Letter of Offer was effectively suspended and no longer applied.

> 50.     _After pro-longed discussions, it was eventually decided_ _that KA would be incorporated._ _KA would take over operations of KGC and this included taking over the purchase of the Land. Johor Corporation was duly informed of this in or around February 2014_.

> 51.     _While Johor Corporation had sent a Sale and Purchase Agreement to KA in or around March 2014, this was not executed as it continued to refer to KGC as the purchaser_ _. Johor Corporation had requested for several documents from KGC which were never sent, preventing them from changing the name of the purchaser from KGC to KA_. This is reflected in a letter dated 17th August 2014 from Johor Corporation to KGC annexed at \[54-56\] at PDS-1.

> 52.    In the circumstances, contrary to what has been pleaded by the Plaintiffs _the payment of 20% of the purchase price was never to take place in or around March 2014. Parties were still in discussions about changing the purchaser from KGC to KA_. The earlier timeline as set out in the Letter of Offer no longer applied either.” _\[Emphasis added\]_

50     In light of the common ground between the parties as to why the Sale and Purchase Agreement was not executed in March 2014, I found it difficult to see what further light Johor Corporation and Azmi and Associates representatives could shed light on this point.

51     The Defendant’s further contention that witnesses _from Johor Corporation_ could testify as to “the issue of the Defendant’s contributions leading up to the Land purchase and beyond, \[which is\] relevant to ascertaining \[the Defendant’s\] entitlement to reimbursement and expenses”[^13] stands on an even weaker footing. Firstly, the Defendant’s claim that he was entitled to remuneration for work done was not disputed by the Plaintiff (see \[18\] above). The Plaintiffs’ sole contention was that the details of his remuneration had yet to be expressly discussed and agreed between the parties. In any event, it was difficult to understand how Johor Corporation, an external party, would be in a position to testify was to what the private salary arrangements discussed between KA and Defendant were, much less the precise amount of the remuneration agreed to be paid by KA to Defendant. Matters of salary were surely issues that were discussed exclusively between the Kiran group and the Defendant.

52     As the Court of Appeal noted in _Rappo_, it is the _quality_ of the connecting factors, i.e. the connections that have the “most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute” that will affect the court’s assessment of whether Malaysia or Singapore is the more appropriate forum for the trial of the dispute (see \[25\] above). Thus, in _Rickshaw Investments Ltd v Nicolai Baron van Uexkall_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 1 SLR(R) 377</span> (“_Rickshaw Investments”)_, the Court of Appeal found that as the “_key witnesses_” to the dispute were located in Singapore, this was a factor that pointed to Singapore being the most natural forum to hear the substantive disputes in that case.

53     Having regard to the fact that the _key witnesses_ (i.e. M.S. Jain, Rufus and the Defendant) were all either willing and/or compellable to testify in Singapore, I did not think the Defendant’s professed intention to call the Malaysian witnesses would shift the balance of convenience significantly in favour of Malaysia. The evidence these Malaysian witnesses would purportedly be asked to give have not, in my view, been shown to be arguably relevant to Defendant’s defence, having regard to matters that may reasonably be expected to be within their knowledge, as well as the undisputed facts between the parties as borne out by the affidavits filed in these proceedings.

#### The connections to relevant events and transactions

54     I noted that the Plaintiff’s case was that the Sum was transferred to the Defendant to effect part payment in connection with the Land Deal entered into by 1st Plaintiff (a Malaysian company) with Johor Corporation (another Malaysian company).

55     While the underlying land transaction involved Malaysian companies and Malaysian immovable property, these, in my view, were not critical elements of the present dispute. Indeed, the present dispute did not relate directly to the Land Deal, which only formed the background of this dispute. The links to Malaysia, solely by virtue of the situs of the land and the place of incorporation of the Malaysian buyer and seller, would not shift the balance of convenience significantly in favour of Malaysia. Indeed, there was no dispute relating to the Plaintiff and its Malaysian counterparty relating to the Sale and Purchase Agreement, which had since been concluded.

56     The dispute in this particular case related, instead, to the purpose for which the Sum was transferred. In this regard, the Sum was transferred from an account in the United Arab Emirates, to the Defendant’s OCBC bank account in Singapore. The recipient of the monies was the Defendant, a Singaporean national resident in Singapore. The monies were then withdrawn from the Singapore account by the Defendant. Accordingly, the alleged breach of duty by the Defendant took place in Singapore. It was not even the Defendant’s case that the monies were transferred out of Singapore, including to any account or parties in Malaysia. The links with Malaysia were again tenuous.

#### The applicable law to the dispute

57     In the present cases, the authorities cited by Plaintiff suggest that the claims based on unjust enrichment would be governed by Singapore law. The proper law for an unjust enrichment claim would be the law of the place where the unjust enrichment occurred. In the present case, this would be Singapore, as the funds were transferred to a Singapore bank account: see _Thahir Kartika Ratna v PT Pertambangam Minyak dan Gas Bumi Negara (Pertamina)_ <span class="citation">\[1994\] 3 SLR(R) 312</span>.

58     Plaintiffs submitted that claims of breach of trust based on an agency relationship would similarly be governed by Singapore law as the funds were received by Defendant (as agent) on behalf of KCGL (as principal) in Singapore. The duty of the Defendant as agent was thereafter to apply these funds from Singapore to effect payment to Johor Corporation as directed by KGCL.

59     The principles relating to the choice of law with regards to claims in equity, including for breach of trust arising from an agency relationship, are not entirely clear: see _Rickshaw Investments_ at \[75\] et seq. It used to be thought that the _lex causae_ for claims in equity would generally be the _lex fori_. The Court of Appeal in _Rickshaw Investments_ had since clarified that a more nuanced approach would need to be adopted, as the “adoption of the _lex fori_ as the _lex causae_ for all issues arising in equity will fail to recognise the disparate doctrine and causes of action arising in equity (i.e. whether arising under contract, tort, breaches of fiduciary duties, etc.)”.

60     In this regard, to the extent the Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of trust arising from an agency relationship effectively sought a disgorgement of the enrichment received in circumstances where the recipient had acted inconsistently with the beneficiary’s rights under the trust, it is arguable that the claim could properly be classified as a claim for unjust enrichment: see _Dicey, Morris & Collins on The Conflict of Laws (15th Ed 2012)_ (“_Dicey, Morris & Collins”)_ at \[36-064\]. The proper law for an action for breach of trust arising from agency in this instance should therefore similarly be governed by the proper law for unjust enrichment claims, namely Singapore law (see para \[57\] above). This point is, however, not clear beyond doubt, as the relevant passage from Dicey, Morris & Collins was dealing with an action for knowing receipt, which is a similar, but nonetheless distinct, equitable doctrine.

61     On the other hand, it was not disputed that the First Plaintiff’s claims against the Defendant arising out of breach of fiduciary duties owed to KA would be governed by Malaysian law: see _Oro Negro Drilling Pte Ltd and others v Integradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro SAPI de CV_ \[2020\] 1 SLR 0226 (at \[59\]); and _Focus Energy Ltd v Aye Aye Soe_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 1086</span> (at \[31\]).

62     Even if the claim for breach of fiduciary duties and/or breach of trust arising out of an agency relationship were governed by Malaysian law, this would not affect the balance of convenience _if_ Malaysian and Singapore law on the issues in question were similar. In _CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 543</span>, the Court of Appeal thus noted that if the relevant foreign governing law was substantially similar, it would not be a significant factor in shifting the balance of convenience in favor of another forum:

> “However, such advantages will not be obtained in the instant case because Singapore law on unjust enrichment is similar, if not identical, to that prevailing in England. Singapore courts would be able to apply English law without the aid of foreign experts. On this basis, the applicable law factor, even if it were English law, would not be a factor of much significance_.”_

63     In this regard, legal advice received from the Plaintiffs’ Malaysian counsel suggested that the law on breach of trust in respect of director’s duties and breach of trust in respect of an agency relationship are similar in Singapore and Malaysia: see Rufus’ first affidavit at pp 102-110. This point was not seriously challenged by the Defendant.

64     Indeed, the Deputy Registrar, the Plaintiff Counsel and the Defendant Counsel all agreed that the applicable law of the dispute was a neutral factor in the present case.

#### Lis alibi pendens

65     There is no _lis alibi pendens_ as such in the present case. While the Defendant had asserted in his affidavits that he would be mounting a counterclaim against, _inter alia_, the 1st Plaintiff for conspiracy to deprive the Defendant of his directorship and shareholding in KA, to date no proceedings in respect of the same has been commenced in Malaysia or anywhere else.

66     Further, based on his affidavits, the Defendant’s claim was that his one-third shareholding was unlawfully transferred to one Atul Jain, M.S. Jain’s son. He indicated that he would be seeking damages for the value of share illegally transferred, or in the alternative, an order that the transfer of his shareholding to Atul Jain be invalidated and that he be re-instated as a one-third shareholder of the 1st Plaintiff, with damages to be assessed[^14].

67     Against this backdrop, the Defendant’s purported “counterclaim” for fraudulent transfer of his shares appeared to me to be a wholly separate matter which had nothing to do with the present Suit, which was for recovery of the Sum. The Defendant’s “counterclaim” ought not hamper the progress of the present lawsuit. I agree with Plaintiff Counsel that it was telling that despite the Defendant’s protestations of fraud having been perpetrated against him, no action has to date been commenced by him against the perpetrators of the fraud, suggesting that the claim of _lis alibi pendens_ was raised for purely tactical reasons.

#### Shape of the Litigation

68     The “shape of the litigation” relates to how the parties’ case had been pleaded and argued.

69     In their Statement of Claim, apart from seeking payment of a monetary sum, the Plaintiffs had additionally sought, among other things:

> (i)     all necessary accounts and inquiries \[to be taken\] to enable KA and/or PTAL to trace and recover the assets mentioned above (paragraph 24(d) SOC); and

> (ii)     Order for the delivery up or transfer to KA and/or PTAL of the said assets (paragraph 24(d) SOC).

70     These are not uncommon remedies sought in an action brought to recover monies misappropriated in breach of trust.

71     It is trite that a foreign judgment will only be recognised in Singapore under statute if it involves the payment of a sum of money: see Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed), and Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act (Cap. 265, 2001 Rev Ed).

72     Even if the common law principles of recognition were relied upon, it is similarly a requirement that the foreign judgment must be for a debt or a definite sum of money: see _Dicey, Morris & Collins_ at \[14R-020\], \[14-021\] and \[14-022\], and _Sadler v Robins_ (1808) 1 Camp. 253.

73     Given that the specific remedies sought by the Plaintiffs included non-monetary relief such as an action for account, it was appropriate, and indeed necessary, for the Plaintiffs to have commenced the Suit in Singapore to facilitate the enforcement of these remedies against the Defendant. If the Plaintiffs had to pursue its claims in Malaysia, then even if they were successful, the Plaintiffs would have faced significant difficulties in enforcing any non-monetary awards granted by the Malaysian courts in Singapore.

### Conclusion on Stage 1 of the Spiliada test

74     Having considered the factors above, I am of the view that the Defendant had not shown that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum for the trial of this action. The witnesses whom the Defendant wished to call from Johor Corporation and Azmi and Associates have not been particularised, and their locations are unknown at this time. The evidence they were able to give in aid of the Defendant’s case appears speculative, and at any rate did not appear to go to the core of the dispute between the Plaintiffs and Defendant – namely, establishing the actual purpose for which the Sums were transferred to the Defendant. Indeed, this fact would, from an objective standpoint, only have been known to the immediate parties to the fund transfer, i.e. M.S. Jain, Rufus and the Defendant, who are resident in India and Singapore respectively.

75     While these Malaysian witness (e.g. representatives Johor Corporation and Azmi and Associates) might confirm or shed light on some subsidiary issues (e.g. that the contract was not in fact executed in March 2014; the reason for the non-execution was due to the failure to reflect KA as the purchaser; and that the Defendant had done work for KGC and/or KA in connection with the Land Deal), these subsidiary issues were, however, not severely disputed based on the affidavits filed by the parties. The Defendant’s professed desire to call these witnesses would therefore not significantly tilt the balance of convenience in favour of Malaysia given the factual matrix of the present case.

76     On the other hand, the Plaintiff had pointed out significant connecting factors with Singapore. For one, the Defendant is resident in Singapore and does not appear to have any assets in Malaysia. The Defendant is compellable as a witness in Singapore court proceedings. The two other _key witnesses_ - namely M.S. Jain and Rufus – have also evinced their willingness to testify before the Singapore courts.

77     The moneys which formed the subject matter of the present dispute were further transferred from the United Arab Emirates to a Singapore account, and thereafter allegedly wrongfully disbursed by the Defendant in Singapore from such account. In the event action the Plaintiffs succeeds in its claim, enforcement action is likely to take place in Singapore. This would potentially include the taking of an account of the monies paid into the Defendant’s OCBC account.

78     Under Stage 1 of the Spiliada test, the legal burden lies on the Defendant to demonstrate that Malaysia was a “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” forum than Singapore for the trial of the substantive dispute between the parties. Having regard to the _quality_ of the connecting factors to the two jurisdictions, I was not persuaded that the Defendant had discharged his burden of showing that Malaysia was “clearly or distinctly” more appropriate for the trial of this action.

### Stage 2 of the Spiliada test

79     Even if I were to conclude that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum under the first stage of the Spiliada test, I was of the view that the justice of the case nonetheless required that a stay of the Singapore proceedings _not_ be granted.

#### Claims partially time-barred in Malaysia

80     The writ in the present action was filed on 26 February 2020. The monies were allegedly wrongfully appropriated by the Defendant in or around 1 March 2014, but was only discovered by the Plaintiffs in August 2014.

81     As Professor Tang Hang Wu noted in _Principles of the Law of Restitution in Singapore (Singapore Academy of Law, 2019 ed)_, the limitation period of an unjust enrichment claim is likely to be 6 years[^15], following the pronouncements of the court in _eSys Technologies Pte Ltd v nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 2 SLR 1200</span> at \[41\]. The learned author reasoned that unjust enrichment claims would be regarded as a form of _quasi contract_, and would accordingly fall within s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163, 1986 Rev Ed) (“**Limitation Act**”). Under s 12 of the Limitation Act, the 6-year time period would further run from the time of discovery of the fraud by the Defendant. Based on the Plaintiffs’ affidavits, the Plaintiffs only discovered the misappropriation of the Sum in August 2014. If Malaysia law were similar to Singapore law on this issue (and it has not been contended otherwise), the unjust enrichment claim had thus become time barred by August 2020.

82     Separately, the Plaintiffs had also pleaded an action for an account: see paragraph 24(d) of the Statement of Claim (“**SOC**”). Under ss. 6(2) and 12 of the Limitation Act, the time bar for bringing an action for an account is 6 years. If Malaysia law were similar to Singapore law on this issue, the Plaintiffs’ claim for an account would similarly have become time barred by August 2020.

83     It followed from the above that if the Singapore proceedings were stayed in favour of Malaysia, a significant number of the causes of action pleaded by the Plaintiff would have become time barred in Malaysia by now.

#### Plaintiffs acted reasonably in commencing the Suit in Singapore

84     Defence Counsel, however, cited _Brinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp and another v PT Airfast Services Indonesia and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 2 SLR(R) 345</span> (“_Brinkerhoff”_) in support of her argument that the fact that some of the Plaintiffs’ causes of action had become time barred in Malaysia was not relevant for present purposes. If there was another clearly more appropriate forum for the trial of the action, a stay should generally be granted even if the plaintiff’s action was time-barred there. In _Brinkerhoff_, the Court of Appeal thus stayed the Singapore proceedings in favour of Indonesia, the more appropriate forum, even though the plaintiff’s had become time-barred in Indonesia.

85     The factual matrix of _Brinkerhoff_ was, however, very different from the present case. The plaintiff in _Brinkerhoff_ was the executor of a passenger who died when a charter flight operated by the defendants crashed. The accident took place in Indonesia. The aircraft in question was registered in Indonesia, and subject to the standards of airworthiness prescribed by the Indonesian aviation authorities. The witnesses who could give evidence on the crash (the persons who saw the crash, the air traffic controllers, and different Indonesian governmental divisions involved in an air crash investigation) were all based in Indonesia. The plaintiff was an American citizen living in Bangkok. He had no connection whatsoever with Singapore other than the fact that he boarded the ill-fated flight from Singapore. On these facts, the court found that it was abundantly clear the whole transaction had more real and substantial connections with Indonesia than Singapore. The plaintiff, nevertheless, failed to provide any basis for explaining why he acted reasonably in not commencing proceedings in Indonesia, but chose instead to file the action in Singapore one day before the action became time barred. The plaintiff thereafter also did not make any effort to show why a stay of the Singapore proceedings ought not be granted, other than to state that the action had become time barred in Indonesia.

86     In contrast, in the present case, as discussed above, there were significant and important connecting factors with Singapore, including the fact that the Defendant who was sued was resident in Singapore, had assets in Singapore, had dissipated the funds in question from Singapore, and any action for account would probably involve OCBC Bank in Singapore. The links with Malaysia were, on the other hand, tenuous.

87     In this regard the following passage by Lord Goff in _Spiliada_ which was quoted by the Court of Appeal in _Brinkerhoff_ is instructive:

> “Indeed, …. if there is another clearly more appropriate forum…, a stay should generally be granted even though the plaintiff’s action would be time-barred there. But, in my opinion, _this is a case where practical justice should be done. And practical justice demands that, if the court considers that the plaintiff acted reasonably in commencing proceedings in this country, and that, although it appears that_ (putting on one side the time bar point) _the appropriate forum for the trial of the action is elsewhere than England, the plaintiff did not act unreasonably in failing to commence proceedings_ (for example by issuing a protective writ) _in that jurisdiction within the limitation period applicable there, it would not …… be just to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit of having started proceedings within the limitation period applicable in this country._” _\[Emphasis added\]_

88     In the present case, I am of the view that practical justice demands that the Defendant, having acted reasonably in commencing the action in Singapore in view of the connecting factors with Singapore as discussed above, should not be deprived of the benefit of having commenced the proceedings in Singapore within the applicable limitation periods.

#### Plaintiffs’ failure to file a protective writ in Malaysia not unreasonable

89     The Defendant argued alternatively that, when SUM 1482 was filed, the Plaintiffs ought to have preserved their rights by filing a protective writ in Malaysia as the limitation period for the unjust enrichment claim was due to expire in Malaysia in three to four months’ time. Given that it failed to do so when it was still possible for a protective writ to be filed in Malaysia, the Plaintiff had only themselves to blame.

90     I did not think Plaintiffs acted unreasonably in not filing a protective writ in Malaysia. Based on the latest affidavits filed by the parties’ Malaysian lawyers, it was unclear whether the concept of protective writs existed in Malaysia. The Plaintiffs’ Malaysian[^16] counsel highlighted the prescriptive language of Order 6 rule 7(2A) of the Malaysian Rules of Court 2012, which provides that in the event a writ is issued, attempts must be made to serve the writ within one month of the date of sealing, failing which an application for a renewal of the writ may not be allowed. Order 6 rule 7(2A) of the Malaysian Rules of Court 2012 provides as follows:

> “an application for a renewal of a writ _must_ be made before the expiry of the writ, ex parte by notice of application supported by affidavit showing that efforts have been made to serve the defendant within one month from the date of issue of the writ and that efforts have been made subsequent thereto to effect service” _\[Emphasis added\]_

91     Plaintiffs’ Malaysian counsel further cited the Malaysian apex court decision of _Duli yang Maha Mulia Tunku Ibrahim Ismail ibni Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj Tunku Mahkota Johor v Datuk Captain Hamzah bin Mohd Noor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 4 MLJ 149</span> (“_Duli Yang Maha Mulia’_) which emphasized that Order 6 Rule 7 (2A) in the Rules of Court 2012 would be strictly enforced by the courts. The Malaysian courts would require that service of any writ be done at the earliest possible time, to prevent abuse by plaintiffs in filing writs and then sleeping on them. Zaki Azmi CJ delivering the judgement of the Malaysian Federal Court noted as follows:

> “\[31\]  _In my opinion the object of the new O 6 r 7 was to make it really tight as to when a writ can be renewed. The word 'must' appearing in O 6 r 7(2A) is not usually used in Malaysian legislations_. Normally the word used is 'shall'. So in this case, _when the word 'must' is used, the intention is to fully ensure that it is complied with_ _and no discretion is to be given as far as the compliance with the prerequisites is concerned__. 'Must' is a very strong word; in my opinion it is stronger than the word 'shall'._

> …

> \[36\]  The words 'Subject to para (2A)' in the impugned O 6 r 7(2) further strengthens the argument that before the court could exercise its discretion to renew a writ, para (2A) must be satisfied. It must be further noted that in para (2A) the applicant must show, inter alia, that efforts had been made to serve the defendant within one month of the date of the issue of the writ. _This all the more supports the argument that the applicant must use all due diligence to effect service at the earliest possible time._

> ….

> \[39\]   _I strongly believe that O 6 r 7(2A) of the RHC was introduced to prevent abuse by the plaintiffs in filing writs and sleeping on them without making efforts to serve them. This practice of inactivity is something which courts loathe. It is against the administration of justice. It creates a backlog and results in a false number of pending cases. In my opinion, courts should take serious a view of such cases._ If not, they will continue to remain in the list of outstanding cases. _As such, O 6 r 7(2A) of the RHC must be strictly enforced as required by the rule.”_

> _\[Emphasis added\]_

92     Plaintiffs’ Malaysian counsel further pointed out that the Malaysian Court of Appeal decision of _Huang Min (in her personal capacity as the mother of the deceased, Zhang Meng and for the benefit of the deceased’s family as defined under the Carriage by Air Act 1974) & Ors v Malaysian Airline System Bhd & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 MLJ 450</span> (“_Huang Min_”) further clarified that the intention to file a “protective writ” did not constitute sufficient grounds to stay proceedings in Malaysia. The Malaysian Court of Appeal noted:

> “\[81\] While we consider as palpable the appellants’ explanation that the purpose of filing the _protective writ_ was to protect their rights under the Malaysian law in view of the jurisdictional challenge by the first to third respondents in the US suits, _this does not constitute a sufficient ground to justify putting the progress of the Malaysian suit on hold_.”

> _\[Emphasis added\]_

93     Defendant’s Malaysian counsel[^17], on the other hand, rendered a legal opinion stating that “Malaysian law does practice and adopt the concept of \`a protective writ’ in its jurisprudence”. Malaysian courts are prepared to exercise their procedural discretions “to stay or to suspend the operation of the legal action for good reasons, especially were the stay or suspension is requested for reason that other actions in other tribunals and courts are ongoing”. Counsel cited the decision of _Andre Ravindran S Arul v Duli Yang Amat Mulia Tunku Ibrahim Ismail Ibni Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 6 MLJ 110</span> (“_Andre Ravindran_”) where James Foong J held that the filing of a protective writ was allowed under Malaysia law.

94     The difficulty with _Andre Ravindran_, as the Plaintiffs’ Malaysian counsel noted was that it went against the principle set out in the more recent Federal Court decision of _Duli Yang Maha Mulia_ insofar as the construction of Order 6 Rule 7(2A) of the Rules of Court was concerned. It might therefore properly be regarded as having been overruled by the Malaysian Federal Court in _Duli Yang Maha Mulia_.

95     Defendant’s Malaysian counsel next cited Vernon Ong JCA’s judgment in _Huang Min_, where His Honour stated that “it has been accepted that an exceptional case may be made out where the proceedings sought to be stayed were started purely to protect the claimant’s limitation position….. It follows that once the court had made a finding that the Malaysian action is a protective writ, the requirement of special circumstances have been satisfied” (at \[20\]).

96     However as Plaintiffs’ Malaysian counsel pointed out, Vernon Ong JCA was delivering a dissenting judgment in _Huang Min_. His pronouncements of the legal effect of protective writs in Malaysia may accordingly not be persuasive authority even in Malaysia.

97     Based on the opinions of the Malaysian lawyers outlined above, there was, in my view, significant uncertainty (and it was indeed doubtful) whether the concept of protective writs existed in Malaysia, especially in light of the ruling of the Malaysian apex court in _Duli yang Maha Muli_, the majority view in _Huang Min_, and the prescriptive language of O 6 r 7(2A) of the Malaysian ROC.

98     Against this backdrop, I did not think the Plaintiff could be faulted, or be deemed to have acted unreasonably, for not commencing and prosecuting parallel actions in Malaysia just to pre-empt any application by the Defendant to stay the Singapore action on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_. Doing so would have created a multiplicity of proceedings, with attendant costs consequences.

99     Plaintiffs’ counsel also pointed out, which I accepted, that the decision not to file a protective writ in Malaysia was a _considered decision_ the Plaintiffs made after seeking the advice of Malaysian counsel before the applicable limitation periods in Malaysia ran out. The advice of Malaysian counsel that the concept of protective writs did not exist in Malaysia was first obtained in May 2020, before the limitation period for the unjust enrichment claims and the action for account in Malaysia expired in August 2020. This was borne out by Plaintiff’s Malaysian counsel’s legal advice dated 11 March 2021 on the status of protective writs in Malaysia. At paragraph 7 of the legal opinion, the Plaintiffs’ Malaysian counsel stated that the written legal opinion was “an expansion of the _oral advice furnished in May 2020_”[^18]. Against this backdrop, I am of the view that the Plaintiffs did not act unreasonably in failing to take out a protective writ in Malaysia before the limitation period expired.

### Conclusion on Stage 2 of the Spiliada test

100    Having regard to the time bar issue discussed above, even if I had found Malaysia to be a more appropriate forum, I did not think it would be just in the circumstances to stay the Singapore proceedings in favour of Malaysia. The Plaintiffs’ reasons for commencing the action in Singapore were by no means tactical in nature. The Plaintiffs had, in my view, acted reasonably in commencing proceedings in Singapore. There were important connecting factors to Singapore. The nature of the relief sought (e.g. an action for an account) further rendered it appropriate for the Plaintiffs to commence the action in Singapore to avoid enforcement difficulties. The Plaintiffs had also not acted unreasonably in failing to commence proceedings (for example by issuing a protective writ) in Malaysia. All things considered, I was of the view that practical justice demands that the plaintiff should not be denied the benefit of having started proceedings within the limitation period applicable in Singapore, which would be inevitable outcome if the Singapore proceedings were stayed.

## Judgment

101    For these reasons, I allowed the appeal, and dismissed the Defendant’s application to stay the Suit on the grounds of _forum non conveniens_. I further gave the Defendant leave to file its defence within 21 days of the date of my order.
