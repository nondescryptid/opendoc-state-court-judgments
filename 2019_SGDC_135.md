2 July 2019

### District Judge Christopher Tan Pheng Wee:

## Introduction

The Accused is a 37-year-old male. He claimed trial to the following charge under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”) for unauthorised consumption of methamphetamine:

> DAC 915446/2018

> … you, on or before 23 April 2018, in Singapore, did consume a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act …, to wit, methamphetamine, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act … ;

> and further,

> that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 22 January 2013, … convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, morphine, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act … and punished under Section 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under Section 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act … .

I found the Accused guilty and sentenced him to 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment, with 6 strokes of the cane.

2       The Accused, who is currently serving his sentence, has appealed against his conviction.

## The Prosecution’s Evidence

3       On 23 April 2018, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) raided a unit at Block 544 Woodlands Drive 16. The Accused returned to the unit during the raid and was duly arrested by the CNB officers. He was then brought to the CNB office at Ang Mo Kio Police Division, where he underwent an Instant Urine Test (“IUT”).

4       The CNB officer escorting the Accused during the IUT procedure was one Staff Sergeant Ahmad Fadzly (“SSgt Fadzly”). Under the supervision of SSgt Fadzly, the Accused urinated into a master bottle.[^1] Thereafter, the Accused transferred some of the urine from the master bottle into two smaller blue-capped bottles[^2] - these were sealed, labelled and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. As regards the urine remaining in the master bottle, some of this was siphoned into a test tube and used to conduct the IUT[^3] (while the rest of the urine in the master bottle was disposed of[^4]).

5       Upon conclusion of the IUT, a result slip[^5] was generated which contained the entry “Amphetamine: POS”, meaning that the IUT found the Accused’s urine to be positive for amphetamines. Amphetamines are a class of drugs which includes methamphetamine.[^6] Subsequently, HSA reverted with the following:

> (a)     A certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1833-04060-002-03,[^7] signed by HSA Analyst Maggie Tiong Su Su (“Maggie Su”); and

> (b)     A certificate bearing Lab No. AT-1833-04060-001-03,[^8] signed by HSA Analyst Zhang HuiFen Hannah (“Hannah Zhang”).

Both certificates affirmed that the Accused’s urine samples in the blue-capped bottles contained methamphetamine.

6       After the IUT, the Accused gave a long statement dated 23 April 2019 (i.e. within the day of the arrest) that was recorded by SSgt Fadzly (“the First Long Statement”)[^9]. In it, the Accused stated that he consumed cough syrup three days prior to his arrest and had thrown away the syrup bottle:[^10]

> … I do not know why my urine is tested positive. I did not consume drugs. I only consumed cough syrup that I bought at Geylang lorong 23. I bought a bottle of cough syrup for $10 and have finished consuming it. There is no more balance. I have thrown away the said bottle after I finish consuming it. The last time I consumed it was 3 days ago.

7       About a week later, on 30 April 2018, the Accused gave another long statement (“the Second Long Statement”).[^11] This was recorded by CNB’s Investigation Officer for the Accused’s case, Woman Staff Sergeant Joanne Ng (“W/SSgt Joanne”). In the Second Long Statement, the Accused again mentioned that he had consumed illicit cough syrup a few days before his arrest:[^12]

> … I do not know why my urine is tested positive for methamphetamine. I only consumed the cough syrup which I bought from a Chinese guy which I saw at Geylang Lorong 23 a few days before my arrest. I bought the bottle of cough syrup for $10 or $15/- I cannot remember. The size of the cough syrup bottle is similar to the ones sold at the doctor’s clinic. It contained about ¾ full of cough syrup. I drank the bottle of cough syrup one shot to get high because I am a ‘heroin’ addict and I did not want to consume or smoke ‘heroin’ anymore as I know I am LT-2 liable, should I get caught. As such, I buy these illicit cough syrup from Geylang to curb \[_sic_\] with my ‘heroin’ addiction and withdrawal. I have already consumed everything before getting arrested. This is my first time buying cough syrup from the ‘Chinese guy’ and I do not know his name or contact no. Other than that, I did not consume any other controlled drugs or medications. …

The Second Long Statement, which was about one-page long, was recorded over a span of 15 minutes. Specifically, recording commenced at 2.45pm and ended at 3.00pm.

8       Immediately after recording the Second Long Statement, W/SSgt Joanne proceeded to execute the preparatory steps (e.g. reading of the charge) for recording the Accused’s cautioned statement under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) (“the Cautioned Statement”). She commenced these steps at 3.00pm and, at 3.04pm, began recording the Cautioned Statement proper. The Cautioned Statement was recorded over a span of one minute, i.e. from 3.04pm to 3.05pm. In the Cautioned Statement,[^13] the Accused denied taking Ice (the street name for methamphetamine) and re-iterated that he took cough syrup. He also added that he had taken two illicit sex enhancement pills, saying that he finished consuming the cough syrup and sex enhancement pills two days before his arrest:

> I do not know why my urine is tested positive for methamphetamine. I really never take ‘ice’ and I know what ‘ice’ is. I also got take illicit cough syrup and sex enhancement pills before I was arrested but I have already finished consuming all the cough syrup and 2 sex enhancement pills the day before my arrest. The pills were light green capsules which I bought for $5/- each together with the cough syrup from the Chinese guy. I do not have any of these left on me during my arrest when the CNB came as I have finished it all.

9       About three months after the Cautioned Statement was taken, while the Accused was in remand, he sent CNB a letter dated 2 August 2018. According to the Prosecution, the Accused had (through this letter) indicated that he consumed Lipodrene Hardcore (“Lipodrene”) and Ephedrine prior to his arrest.[^14] These are weight loss supplements.[^15]**_Neither_** Lipodrene[^16] nor Ephedrine[^17] will give rise to methamphetamine in the urine, if consumed.[^18] Ultimately, the 2 August 2018 letter was not tendered in evidence as the Prosecution said that it contained material prejudicial to the Accused.[^19] The Accused similarly did not seek to admit the 2 August 2018 letter and also did not dispute the Prosecution’s depiction of its contents.[^20]

10     On 21 September 2018, the Accused filed his Case for the Defence,[^21] wherein he denied taking Ice and claimed that he had consumed some supplements which may contain methamphetamine:

> I’m denying to \[_sic_\] the charge as I did not consume any crystalline substances commonly known as “ICE”. However, I did consume some supplements which may contains \[_sic_\] methamphetamine. Therefore, my urine samples contained methamphetamine as a result of my consumption of these supplements.

11     Subsequently, at a pre-trial conference, the Accused informed that he had consumed a substance called Desoxyn prior to his arrest. According to the Prosecution’s records, the pre-trial conference at which the Accused first raised the issue of Desoxyn consumption was held on 31 January 2019.[^22]

## Submission of No Case to Answer

12     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Accused submitted that he had no case to answer. He did not dispute that methamphetamine _was_ found in his urine. However, he argued that the Prosecution failed to establish that the methamphetamine in his urine came from illicit methamphetamine sources (such as Ice), as opposed to prescription medication. [^23]

13     To buttress his submission, the Accused highlighted the following points:[^24]

> (a)     Upon his arrest, he was not found in possession of anything incriminating that related to consumption of Ice;

> (b)     He had no records of ever having consumed Ice in the past; and

> (c)     His statements did not contain any confessions.

14     The Prosecution, for its part, pointed out that the Accused did not challenge the procedures by which his urine samples had been tested positive for methamphetamine. These procedures are prescribed by s 31 of the MDA, the relevant portions of which read:

> **31**.     **Urine tests**

> (1)    Any officer of the \[CNB\] … may, if he reasonably suspects any person to have committed an offence under section 8(b), require that person to provide a specimen of his urine for urine tests to be conducted under this section.

> …

> (4)    A specimen of urine provided under this section shall be divided into 3 parts and dealt with, in such manner and in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed, as follows:

>> (a)    a preliminary urine test shall be conducted on one part of the urine specimen; and

>> (b)    each of the remaining 2 parts of the urine specimen shall be marked and sealed and a urine test shall be conducted on each part by a different person, being either an analyst employed by the Health Sciences Authority or any person as the Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint for such purpose.

15     As such, the Prosecution highlighted that the presumption in s 22 of the MDA has been triggered. This provision states:

> **22**.     **Presumption relating to urine test**

> If any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).

16     I was of view that there was evidence which was not inherently incredible that established every element of the charge. Specifically, I agreed with the Prosecution that the evidence was sufficient to trigger the operation of s 22 of the MDA. As elucidated by the Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 46</span>,[^25] s 22 presumes the presence of both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ for the offence under s 8(b) of the MDA:

> The significance of compliance with s 31(4)(b) is that if there are positive results from both of the urine tests carried out pursuant to this subsection, the s 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of s 8(b), consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine samples. This means that both the _actus reus_ and the _mens rea_ of the s 8(b) offence are presumed by s 22 …

The onus thus fell on the Accused to adduce evidence rebutting that presumption.

17     I invited the Accused to give evidence in his own defence and read to him the allocution under s 230(1)(m) of the CPC. The Accused elected to give evidence on the stand.

## The Defence

18     The Accused’s defence was that the methamphetamine in his urine did not come from illicit sources (such as Ice) but rather came from Desoxyn. The Accused claimed that he had consumed Desoxyn prior to his arrest[^26] to help him lose weight.[^27] He also relied on the evidence of the HSA analysts Maggie Su and Hannah Zhang, who testified at trial that:

> (a)     Desoxyn is used for the treatment of obesity and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder;[^28]

> (b)     Desoxyn **_can_** give rise to methamphetamine in the urine if consumed;[^29] and

> (c)     It is not possible to distinguish whether the methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine came from illicit drugs or from Desoxyn.[^30]

19     The HSA analysts had also testified that Desoxyn is not registered as a therapeutic product in Singapore[^31] and cannot simply be bought off the shelf.[^32] Even a doctor wishing to prescribe it for a patient needs to first apply for a licence from HSA’s Health Product Regulation group.[^33] Nevertheless, the Accused testified that he was able to procure Desoxyn over Facebook,[^34] from a seller by the name of DJ Fahmy.[^35] He had chatted with DJ Fahmy over Facebook messenger to confirm the transaction details of the sale,[^36] before meeting face-to-face with DJ Fahmy to take delivery of the Desoxyn.[^37] The Accused was even able to describe DJ Fahmy with some detail: “a Malay guy… quite good looking … quite fit”.[^38] However, the Accused was no longer able to furnish DJ Fahmy’s contact details or produce the records of his Facebook chats with DJ Fahmy, as the Accused’s Facebook account had been deleted.[^39] The Accused said that upon his arrest, he had asked his girlfriend to delete his Facebook account as he did not want people looking for him over Facebook, now that he was in prison.[^40]

20     The Accused explained that he purchased only one bottle of Desoxyn from DJ Fahmy.[^41] He paid $1,200 for that bottle,[^42] which contained 100 Desoxyn tablets.[^43] He then proceeded to consume one or two Desoxyn tablets per day,[^44] every day.[^45] At this rate of consumption, the Accused was able to finish the entire bottle of Desoxyn in a span of about two months,45 with the very last Desoxyn tablet being consumed just two days before the arrest.[^46] As such, by the time the Accused was arrested, he was no longer able to produce the Desoxyn bottle to CNB.[^47]

21     The Accused explained that prior to consuming Desoxyn, he had been consuming another weight loss supplement, Lipodrene[^48] (this was the supplement which he had raised to CNB in his 2 August 2018 letter - see paragraph 9 above). The Accused had also purchased the Lipodrene from DJ Fahmy[^49] and had continued consuming Lipodrene even after embarking on his Desoxyn regimen.[^50] As with the Desoxyn bottle, the Accused no longer had any remaining Lipodrene bottles to produce to CNB by the time of his arrest.[^51]

22     Although the Accused could not produce the Desoxyn bottle, his brother Muhammad Aidil bin Haron (“Aidil”) was able to print an image of the Desoxyn bottle resembling that which the Accused purchased. Aidil, who was the only witness called by the Accused (apart from himself), testified that sometime in June or July 2018,[^52] the Accused intimated to him that the methamphetamine in his urine could possibly have come from Desoxyn.[^53] Aidil testified that the Accused then asked him to print an image of the Desoxyn bottle which the Accused purchased.[^54] Aidil duly conducted a search over Google for the Desoxyn bottle, but the search results yielded multiple images, from which Aidil was unable to positively identify the bottle resembling that which the Accused had purchased.[^55] Consequently, Aidil randomly picked the first image which he came across and printed it.[^56] He then brought the printed image to prison and showed it to the Accused, who confirmed that the bottle in the image exactly resembled the bottle he had purchased.[^57] The printed image of the Desoxyn bottle was admitted in evidence and marked as Exhibit D1.

23     When Aidil was on the stand, he also testified that he actually _saw_ the Accused consuming from the Desoxyn bottle, while the Accused was staying with him. He saw the Accused consuming Desoxyn more than once,[^58] during the one week[^59] ending three to five days[^60] before the arrest.

## Findings on Liability

24     The Accused faces a charge under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA, which reads:

> **8**.     **Possession and consumption of controlled drugs**

> Except as authorised by this Act, it shall be an offence for a person to —

>> …

>> (b)    smoke, administer to himself or otherwise consume —

>>> …

>>> (ii)   a specified drug.

25     As highlighted at paragraphs 15-16 above, the presence of methamphetamine in the Accused’s urine triggers the operation of s 22 of the MDA, which presumes both the _actus reus_ and _mens rea_ for the offence under s 8(b). The Accused bears the burden of rebutting that presumption on a balance of probabilities: see _Cheng Siah Johnson v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] SGHC 84</span>.[^61]

26     At the conclusion of the case, I was firmly of the view that the Accused failed to rebut that presumption. His defence of Desoxyn consumption was devoid of merit, for the following reasons:

> (a)     He raised his alleged consumption of Desoxyn only very late in the day and offered no reasonable explanation for that delay. This showed that his defence was an afterthought.

> (b)     The Accused was unable to produce a single shred of evidence proving his alleged purchase of Desoxyn.

> (c)     Aidil’s testimony, which sought to corroborate the Accused’s claim of having consumed Desoxyn, lacked credibility.

I elaborate on each of these points below.

## Accused’s Delay in Raising his Alleged Consumption of Desoxyn

27     The Accused had numerous opportunities to alert the authorities to his alleged consumption of Desoxyn. These opportunities came in the form of:

> (a)     the First Long Statement, recorded on the day of the Accused’s arrest;

> (b)     the Second Long Statement and the Cautioned Statement, recorded one week after the arrest;

> (c)     the Accused’s letter to CNB, dated 2 August 2018; and

> (d)     the Case for the Defence, filed on 21 September 2018.

The circumstances surrounding these occasions are examined below.

#### Accused’s failure to raise Desoxyn consumption in his statements to CNB

28     By the Accused’s own testimony, he had been consuming Desoxyn every day, for a continuous stretch of about two months, right up to two days before his arrest. His Desoxyn regimen would thus have been fresh in his mind at the point of arrest. Yet, when he gave the First Long Statement to SSgt Fadly on the day of his arrest, no mention of Desoxyn was made (the First Long Statement is extracted at paragraph 6 above).

29     The Accused explained that when SSgt Fadzly was recording the First Long Statement, he merely informed the Accused that the latter’s urine tested positive but failed to elaborate that it was positive for _amphetamines_.[^62] As a result of this omission, the Accused erroneously assumed that his urine tested positive for opiates and this in turn led him to raise his consumption of cough syrup. This account was contradicted by SSgt Fadzly, who testified that the Accused was made aware that his urine tested positive for amphetamines. Specifically, SSgt Fadly said that he showed the IUT result slip to the Accused.[^63]

30     I asked the Accused what he would have included in the First Long Statement if SSgt Fadzly had specifically drawn his attention to the fact that his urine tested positive for amphetamines. The Accused replied that he would have been prompted to list more of the substances which he had consumed prior to his arrest:[^64]

>   
| 

Amin:

 | 

… I said I took cough mixture because I assumed that my urine is tested positive for opiate. If I had known my urine is tested positive for amphetamine, I would have think some more what I have eaten, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

… okay, assuming Staff Sergeant Ahmad \[Fadzly\] had told you specifically that you tested positive for amphetamine, what would you have done during the statement recording? What would you have done? What would you have said?

 |
| 

Amin:

 | 

I would have provide more alibis for why my urine is tested positive for amphetamine.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Sorry, what alibi?

 |
| 

Amin:

 | 

What medication I took.

 |

  
  

Presumably, the Accused’s argument was that if his attention had been specifically drawn to the presence of amphetamines in his urine, he could have applied his mind to the full range of supplements ingested by him prior to arrest. This would have allowed him to recall the Desoxyn which he had consumed.

31     However, this excuse clearly rings hollow when one looks at what transpired one week after the arrest, when the Second Long Statement and Cautioned Statement were recorded. By that point, the Accused already knew that his urine had tested positive for methamphetamine. Still, he failed to raise Desoxyn in any of these statements:

> (a)     In the Second Long Statement (extracted at paragraph 7 above), recorded by W/SSgt Joanne on 30 April 2019, the Accused merely repeated his original defence that he had consumed cough syrup. The Accused went so far as to end the Second Long Statement by saying: “**_Other than that, I did not consume any other controlled drugs or medications_**.”

> (b)     In his Cautioned Statement (extracted at paragraph 8 above), which was recorded by W/SSgt Joanne immediately after recording the Second Long Statement, the Accused re-iterated that he had consumed cough syrup and also went on to add that he had consumed two sex enhancement pills.

By the time the Cautioned Statement was recorded, the charge would already have been read to the Accused and he would have been cautioned (pursuant to the procedure under s 23 of the CPC) about the adverse consequences of omitting to mention matters relevant to his defence. Apparently, this was enough to prompt him to mention the sex enhancement pills, over and above the cough syrup. Yet, Desoxyn remained conspicuously absent from both statements.

32     During the trial, the Accused explained that W/SSgt Joanne had been very fast in recording the Second Long Statement, with the result that he could not think properly.[^65] At one point, the Accused went so far as to allege that W/SSgt Joanne had rushed him when taking the Second Long Statement.[^66] The Accused also explained that after recording the Second Long Statement, W/SSgt Joanne had immediately proceeded to execute the preparatory steps (under s 23 of the CPC) for recording the Cautioned Statement. These steps, which included the reading of the charge, had been conducted over a span of only four minutes, i.e. from 3.00pm to 3.04pm. The Accused said that these additional four minutes were still insufficient to give him space to think.[^67] Thereafter, the Cautioned Statement was recorded over the span of one minute, i.e. from 3.04pm to 3.05pm.

33     I found the Accused’s claim of having been rushed to be without merit. Objectively, I did not see how the allocation of 15 minutes for recording the Second Long Statement (which stretched for only one page), and five minutes for the Cautioned Statement process (comprising four minutes for reading the charge and caution plus one minute after that for recording the Cautioned Statement) could be described as a “rush”. Under cross-examination, the Accused conceded that W/SSgt Joanne never said or did anything to rush him[^68] and that, ultimately, he did not feel rushed.[^69] The Accused also agreed that he was given a chance to read through his statements[^70] and that while he was doing so, he was similarly not rushed.[^71] The evidence thus shows that the Accused _had_ the opportunity to raise all matters relevant to his Defence. He made full use of that opportunity by mentioning cough syrup and sex enhancement pills in his statements. His failure to raise Desoxyn is thus telling.

34     The Accused explained that he had thought to mention the cough syrup and sex enhancement pills because these were items purchased from the black market.[^72] Presumably, the Accused was saying that given their illicit source, these two items would have been more likely in his impression to contain banned substances. These illicit items would thus have been at the forefront of his mind when he was articulating his defence, as compared to substances with more legitimate origins (such as Desoxyn). To this end, the Accused regarded Desoxyn as “prescription medication”[^73] which he had purchased online from Facebook.[^74]

35     I did not think that the Desoxyn which the Accused claimed to have procured quite carried the air of legitimacy which he sought to portray, particularly given the circumstances surrounding its alleged purchase. He did not buy it from some legitimate online retail merchant. Rather, the Accused claimed to have bought it from a Facebook persona by the name of DJ Fahmy, whose contact details the Accused could not furnish. This did not sound like a legitimate source. It could not have been, given that Desoxyn is not a registered therapeutic product in Singapore and even doctors need a licence to purchase it (see paragraph 19 above). As such, if the Accused’s instinct (when raising possible defences to W/SSgt Joanne while she was recording his statement) was to raise substances consumed by him that had questionable origins, it is hard to understand why he did not allude to Desoxyn as well.

36     It is incumbent on accused persons, when giving their long statements to the authorities, to highlight exculpatory matters within their knowledge. The omission to do so may render the defence less believable, unless there are good reasons for that omission. This principle was set out by the Court of Appeal in _Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGCA 12</span>, which held:[^75]

> 18    … In our view, because an accused has such a right against self-incrimination when he makes a long statement under s 121, no adverse inference, in general, may be drawn against him for failing to state any fact or circumstance which may incriminate him in any way.

> 19    If, however, the fact or circumstance that is withheld will exculpate the accused from an offence, a court may justifiably infer that it is an afterthought and untrue, unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for the omission to mention that exculpatory fact or circumstance. This accords with common sense – if an accused believes he is not guilty of an offence that he might be charged with, he would be expected to disclose why he has such a belief. For a self-confessed trafficker like the Appellant, consumption would be an exculpatory fact. Furthermore, an exculpatory fact or circumstance has more credibility if disclosed to an investigating officer at the earliest opportunity after arrest.

Reverting to the present case, I was unable to discern any valid reason for the Accused’s failure to raise his alleged Desoxyn consumption in the First Long Statement (recorded by SSgt Fadzly) or the Second Long Statement (recorded by W/SSgt Joanne).

37     That it was imperative for the Accused to clearly set out his defence must have become all the more apparent after W/SSgt Joanne executed the preparatory steps (under s 23 of the CPC) for recording the Cautioned Statement. The Accused would have been expressly cautioned about the adverse consequences that could arise from his failure to fully articulate his defence. As regards cautioned statements, the Court of Appeal in _PP v Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chukwudi_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGCA 33</span> had this to say:[^76]

> At this point, ie, the obtaining of the cautioned statement, it is incumbent on an accused person, if he was in fact innocent, to come clean with any facts or matter in his defence. If he fails to do so, the court may draw an adverse inference against him. Under s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2012 (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC 2012”), the court is expressly empowered to draw appropriate inferences on the failure of accused persons, upon being charged with an offence, to state facts which he could reasonably be expected to mention when so questioned.

38     Reverting to the present case, the Accused has failed to offer any credible explanation for why he repeatedly failed to mention the defence of Desoxyn consumption in every one of his statements to CNB. This is clearly grounds for drawing an adverse inference against him, insofar as the believability of that defence is concerned.

#### Accused’s failure to raise Desoxyn consumption in the 2 August 2018 letter

39     The events transpiring after the recording of the Accused’s statements to CNB further undermine his defence.

40     It was Aidil’s evidence that in **_June or July 2018_**, the Accused told him about Desoxyn and asked him to print the image of the Desoxyn bottle (see paragraph 22 above). To this end, the Accused agreed that by June or July 2018, he _was aware_ of the possibility that Desoxyn could give rise to methamphetamine in the urine.[^77] Yet, when the Accused sent the letter dated 2 August 2018 to CNB, he did not raise his consumption of Desoxyn. Instead, the letter indicated that he had consumed Lipodrene and Ephedrine, both of which (as confirmed by the HSA analysts’ testimonies) will **_not_** give rise to methamphetamine in the urine. The omission to raise Desoxyn even at this very late stage, by which time the Accused was (by his own evidence) pointedly aware of the critical significance of Desoxyn, was stark.

41     According to the Accused, up to the point when the HSA analysts testified at trial, he was unaware that Desoxyn could give rise to methamphetamine in the urine.[^78] I did not think that this assisted in explaining the Accused’s failure to mention Desoxyn in his 2 August 2018 letter. As a preliminary point, one sees from the image of the Desoxyn bottle (in Exhibit D1) that it has a single description printed on the front label: “Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets”. These words stand out in large conspicuous font. The Accused admitted that he could have seen this.[^79] He must have, given that he had allegedly consumed from this bottle every day, over a period of two months.

42     Even if I give the Accused the benefit of the doubt and take the position that he was unaware that Desoxyn contained methamphetamine, the fact is that he similarly did **_not_** know if Lipodrene contained methamphetamine.[^80] If the Accused had seen fit to raise Lipodrene in his 2 August 2018 letter to CNB, despite being uncertain about its chemical contents, it is baffling why he omitted to raise Desoxyn (the chemical contents of which the Accused was similarly unfamiliar with) in that same letter. The raising of Lipodrene but not Desoxyn was particularly inexplicable, given the Accused’s claim that he bought _both_ items from the same person (i.e. DJ Fahmy - see paragraph 21 above). The Accused’s consumption of Desoxyn could not have been any less fresh in his mind than his consumption of Lipodrene, given his claim that he stopped consuming Desoxyn only two days before his arrest.

43     It was not as if the Accused was consuming so many substances that it became difficult for him to keep track of what he had. Apart from Desoxyn and Lipodrene, the only other supplements that the Accused claimed to have consumed were amino acids and whey protein.[^81]

#### Accused’s failure to raise Desoxyn consumption in the Case for the Defence

44     Even after the 2 August 2018 letter, the Accused had yet another opportunity to raise his defence of Desoxyn consumption. This was when he filed his Case for the Defence on 21 September 2018.

45     By way of observation, the Case for the Defence did not allude to the consumption of cough syrup or sex enhancement pills, despite these items having previously been raised by the Accused in his statements to CNB. The Accused explained the omission by saying that he had, by the time of preparing the Case for the Defence, already ascertained from fellow inmates that cough syrup and sex enhancement pills will not give rise to methamphetamine in the urine.[^82]

46     Given that the Accused had (just three months before filing the Case for the Defence) asked his brother to print the image of the Desoxyn bottle, the Accused must have been acutely aware of the pivotal place which Desoxyn held in his defence. Yet, the Accused failed to mention Desoxyn in his Case for the Defence and instead gave the vague statement that he had consumed “some supplements which may contains \[_sic_\] methamphetamine” (see extract from the Case for the Defence, at paragraph 10 above).

47     The Accused tried to explain that he did not have a lawyer to advise him how to fill out the Case for the Defence.[^83] I found it hard to see why the Accused needed a lawyer to tell him to explicitly mention Desoxyn. The Accused had been adept in articulating a slew of possible substances to exculpate himself, both in his Cautioned and Long Statements and in his 2 August 2018 letter to CNB. There was no conceivable reason for him to suddenly drift into reticence in his Case for the Defence, in light of how central Desoxyn was to his case and given that he had just been apprised by his fellow inmates that cough syrup and sex enhancement pills were red herrings.

#### Conclusion on the Accused’s delay in raising Desoxyn consumption

48     The evidence shows that the Accused had numerous opportunities to alert the authorities to his alleged consumption of Desoxyn. His repeated failure to do so strongly supports the inference that the alleged consumption of Desoxyn was an afterthought which the Accused had concocted after having some time to think matters through.

## The Absence of Any Trace of the Accused’s Desoxyn Purchase

49     The Accused was also unable to adduce any evidence to prove his alleged purchase of Desoxyn.

50     The bottle of Desoxyn which he professed to have purchased was never produced. The Accused claimed to have finished the entire bottle of Desoxyn tablets just two days before his arrest. In this regard, one cannot help but note the extraordinary coincidence in timing: the Desoxyn was fully consumed and the bottle disposed of before the arrest (leaving no physical traces), but just close enough to the arrest (i.e. two days before) for the methamphetamine to still be in the Accused’s system.

51     The Accused was also not able to produce the bottle of Lipodrene, which he allegedly purchased from DJ Fahmy as well. In short, there was no trace of any of the items purchased from DJ Fahmy.

52     The Accused was unable to furnish DJ Fahmy’s contact details. He was also not able to produce any record of communications with DJ Fahmy, whether over Facebook or any other medium. Conveniently, the Accused said that when he was arrested, he asked his girlfriend to delete his Facebook account as he did not want people looking him up now that he was in prison. I found this explanation difficult to accept. There is no reason why the Facebook account could not have been left in existence, even if the Accused were in prison. All the more so in this case where the Accused would have known that he had purchased substances over Facebook which could (and eventually did) turn out to be central to his defence. It is inconceivable that he would have deleted all traces of his Facebook communications just like that.

53     Clearly, DJ Fahmy was a figment of the Accused’s imagination.

## Lack of Credibility in Aidil’s Evidence

54     The Accused called his brother Aidil as a witness to testify that he actually _saw_ the Accused consuming from the Desoxyn bottle. Specifically, Aidil testified that he saw the Accused consuming the Desoxyn over the stretch of about a week, up to the point of three to five days before the arrest.

55     As a preliminary point, the fact that Aidil is connected to the Accused (being his brother) is not a ground in and of itself to discount his testimony: _Public Prosecutor v Tan Chui Yun Joselyn_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 19</span>.[^84] Aidil’s evidence will have to be scrutinized with an open mind.

56     By way of background, Aidil was staying at Block 327 Sembawang Crescent at the material time.[^85] This was also the Accused’s official residential address, as reflected in the First Long Statement.[^86] However, the Accused mentioned in the First Long Statement that he was no longer staying at his official residential address as he knew that he was “wanted” for not reporting for his urine test.[^87] He had thus chosen to reside with his friend at Block 544 Woodlands Drive 16. This account comported with the fact that the Accused was ultimately arrested at Block 544 Woodlands Drive 16. As such, the fact that the Accused was no longer residing with Aidil at Block 327 Sembawang Crescent does not sit well with Aidil’s testimony that he was able to witness the Accused consuming from the Desoxyn bottle, right up to three to five days prior to the arrest. There was thus a need to carefully examine the evidence pertaining to the residential arrangement at Block 327 Sembawang Crescent, to see if it was internally consistent.

57     The Accused testified that he **_had his own room_**.[^88] However, it was also his evidence that he consumed Desoxyn _outside_ of his room.[^89] This thus afforded Aidil the opportunity to witness the Accused consuming Desoxyn, despite the Accused having a room of his own. However, Aidil’s evidence was markedly different. Specifically, in testifying as to how he managed to witness the Accused consuming Desoxyn, Aidil said that he **_shared a room_** with the Accused.[^90] The room-sharing arrangement thus formed the canvass against which Aidil painted vivid details of how and when he caught sight of the Desoxyn bottle and the Accused’s consumption therefrom. Specifically, Aidil testified that:

> (a)     he spotted the Desoxyn bottle on a dressing table which both he and the Accused used;[^91] and

> (b)     there was an incident when he woke up and saw the Accused consuming from the Desoxyn bottle.[^92]

Aidil’s evidence, which was grounded against the backdrop of two brothers sharing a room, thus ran directly counter to the Accused’s evidence that the Accused had his own room and Aidil witnessed him consuming Desoxyn outside of that room.

58     In the course of oral submissions, the Accused tried to reconcile Aidil’s evidence by explaining that he and Aidil _did_ share a room but that was some 10 years ago.[^93] It seems that the more the Accused tried to plug the holes in his alibi, the more leaks it sprung. Aidil’s evidence was that he witnessed the Accused consuming Desoxyn over the week that ended about _three to five days before the arrest_. As such, in referring to the room-sharing arrangement, which formed the very context against which Aidil witnessed the alleged Desoxyn consumption, Aidil was talking about the arrangement in existence just prior to the arrest. It was ridiculous to suggest that Aidil was talking about an arrangement existing more than 10 years ago, which would have had absolutely no bearing on the case.

59     There were also other inconsistencies in Aidil’s testimony that demonstrated the unreliability of his evidence. Initially, Aidil claimed that when he saw the Accused consuming from the Desoxyn bottle, he had **_asked_** the Accused about the bottle. Specifically, he asked “What’s this?”, to which the Accused replied that it was his medication:[^94]

> Q… And then you went to ask your brother?

> AYah, I---I went to ask him, yah. What is this? And says for his medication something like that--- And I just ignore it, lah.

> …

> Qyou asked him while he was inside the room as well?

> AUh, other---other---uh, yes, you we---when he was inside the room, lah.

> …

> QAnd then your brother also explained to you what it was?

> ANo, he didn’t explain it to me.

> QOkay.

> AHe just, uh, told me that it’s---it was his medication and I didn’t probe him anymore.

Under cross-examination, Aidil was confronted with the fact that the Accused, in his testimony, never mentioned anything about Aidil asking him about the Desoxyn:[^95]

> Q\---you remember clearly, you asked your brother, “What happened? What was this bottle?” Right?

> AYes.

> QAnd then he said it was his, right?

> AYes, correct.

> QYour brother, in his evidence has not told us any of this.

> AMmm.

After this, Aidil changed his evidence and testified that despite seeing his brother consuming from the Desoxyn bottle more than once, Aidil **_never_** asked him what the bottle was:[^96]

> QSo, just to confirm, you saw \[the Accused\] more than once?

> AYes, correct.

> QAnd despite seeing more than once, you never did ask him what was the bottle---

> ANo---

> Qcorrect?

> Anever.

60     The Accused tried to dismiss these contradictions as “minor discrepancies”.[^97] I did not agree – they were clearly material.

61     The flaws in Aidil’s purported recollection are underscored by his inability to even remember what the Desoxyn bottle looked like. To recap, Aidil’s evidence was that when the Accused asked him to print an image of the Desoxyn bottle, Aidil did a Google search. The search results threw up many images and Aidil was unable to pinpoint the image that resembled the bottle which the Accused had consumed from. As such, Aidil resorted to randomly picking the very first image (which, coincidentally, the Accused confirmed to be the correct image). Specifically, Aidil could not even remember the shape of the bottle - he did not know if it was square or round.[^98] Now, if he could so clearly remember seeing the bottle on the dressing table, and he could recall seeing the Accused consuming from the bottle _more than once_ (see paragraph 23 above), it is hard to see why Aidil could not even say whether the bottle was square or round.

62     Overall, I found Aidil’s evidence to be unreliable and consequently insufficient to exculpate the Accused.

## Conclusion

63     In my opinion, the Accused failed to rebut the presumption under s 22 of the MDA, for the following reasons:

> (a)     He failed to mention his alleged consumption of Desoxyn despite repeated opportunities to do so. This defence was clearly an afterthought.

> (b)     There was not a single trace of evidence to prove the alleged purchase of Desoxyn from DJ Fahmy. The Accused’s explanations as to how all such traces came to be extinguished were not worthy of belief.

> (c)     The evidence given by Aidil (that he saw the Accused consuming Desoxyn) was inconsistent and contradicted by the Accused’s own testimony.

64     Consequently, I find that the charge under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA has been proven beyond reasonable doubt and I convict the Accused accordingly.

65     The Accused’s antecedents are set out below:

In particular, the Accused’s conviction in 2013 under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA resulted in him being sentenced under s 33A(1) of the MDA. As such, his conviction in the present case before me renders him liable to enhanced punishment under s 33A(2) of the MDA, which prescribes a minimum term of 7 years and 6 strokes of the cane.

66     In his mitigation, the Accused asked to be sentenced to the minimum punishment.[^99]

67     Given that the Accused claimed trial, I did not afford him the sentencing discount that would ordinarily have been extended to an accused person who pleads guilty. I thus sentenced the Accused to an imprisonment term of 7 years and 3 months, i.e. three months above the statutorily prescribed minimum imprisonment term. I also sentenced him to the statutorily prescribed minimum of 6 strokes of the cane.

68     The Accused now appeals against his conviction.
