### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The two accused persons are Malaysian nationals. They were instructed by one “Richard Yeoh” to come to Singapore to receive and launder large sums of money which represented benefits of criminal conduct of the said “Richard Yeoh”. The money was fraudulently obtained from victims in Singapore pursuant to what is commonly called “police impersonation scams”. Pursuant to such scams, the victims would receive calls from unknown persons impersonating as police officers who would deceive and pressure the victims into transferring or handing over sums of money to other intermediaries on the instructions of these police imposters. The money collected from the victims was eventually received by the accused persons.

2       The two accused persons were respectively charged with two charges. The respective first charge was for being concerned in an arrangement to collect the benefits of criminal conduct and the respective second charge was for fraudulent possession of money for which they were unable to provide a satisfactory account.

3       The accused persons were represented by counsel and claimed trial to the said charges. At the conclusion of the trial, they were convicted of both their charges.

4       The first accused was sentenced to an aggregate of 54 months’ imprisonment. The second accused, who was under 21 years old, was ordered to undergo Reformative Training for a period of six months. They both appealed against their conviction and sentence. The sentences have been stayed pending the appeal.

## Charges

5       For ease of reference, I set out the two charges against the first accused, Chow Zhi Hong (“Chow”), as follows:

>      First Charge

>     You… are charged that you, on 1 June 2018, at Money Matters Foreign Exchange, 11 Collyer Quay #02-32 The Arcade, Singapore, in common intention with Poon Hong Kuan, were concerned in an arrangement, to wit, you collected cash totalling $369,900 from Chow Wai Chung on behalf of one “Richard Yeoh” (also known as “Lao Ban”), which money represented “Richard Yeoh’s” benefits of criminal conduct, having reasonable grounds to believe that by the arrangement, the retention by “Richard Yeoh” of the benefits of his criminal conduct would be facilitated, and having reasonable grounds to believe that “Richard Yeoh” was a person who engaged in criminal conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 44(1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (the “Act”), Chapter 65A, read with Section 34 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, and punishable under Section 44(5) of the Act.

>      Second Charge

>     You… are charged that you, on 4 June 2018, at Apt Blk 318 Ubi Avenue 1 #XXX, Singapore, did have in your possession cash in the sum $597,450/-, which may be reasonably suspected of being fraudulently obtained, and for which you failed to account satisfactorily how you came by the same, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184.

6       The two charges against the second accused, Poon Hong Kuan (“Poon”), are similarly framed.

## Prosecution’s case

7       The first accused, Chow, was a 33-year-old male Malaysian national at the time of the offences. He is also known as ‘Kent’.

8       The second accused, Poon, was an 18-year-old male Malaysian national and a Singapore Permanent Resident at the time of the offences. He is also called ‘Peter’. They will be referred collectively as ‘the accused persons’ in these grounds.

9       The prosecution’s case, as summarised in the prosecution’s opening statement, is set out in the following paragraphs.[^1]

10     On 1 June 2018, in the vicinity of ‘Money Matters Foreign Exchange’, a shop-space located at The Arcade, the accused persons collected a sum of about $369,900 from PW8 Chow Wai Chung (“Wai Chung”). This sum of money formed the subject-matter of the first charge. The said sum of money comprised of funds collected from victims who were cheated by police impersonators. The prosecution’s case was that the accused persons collected the money from Wai Chung on behalf of one “Richard Yeoh” (hereinafter referred as “Richard”), whom they worked for. They also referred to Richard as “Lao Ban” i.e. their boss.

11     A few days later on 4 June 2018, police officers raided the residence of the accused persons at Blk 318 Ubi Ave 1, #XXX, Singapore (“the flat”) and seized a sum of $597,450. This sum of money formed the subject-matter of the second charge. The accused persons were carrying the money in their respective and they were about to leave the flat when they were arrested.

12     The accused persons are respectively charged with one count under s 44(1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, Chapter 65A (“CDSA charge”) read with s 34 of the Penal Code, Cap 224, for having the common intention with each other to be concerned in an arrangement to collect cash on behalf of one Richard, which cash represented the said Richard’s benefits of criminal conduct, having reasonable grounds to believe that by such arrangement, the retention by Richard of the benefits of his criminal conduct would be facilitated, and having reasonable grounds to believe that Richard was a person who was engaged in criminal conduct; and,

13     They are also charged with a second charge under s 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, Chapter 184 (“MOA charge”) for having possession of cash amounting to $597,450 which was reasonably suspected to have been fraudulently obtained and of which they were unable to give a satisfactory account.

14     The _actus reus_ of the respective offences was not in dispute. In other words, it was not in dispute that the accused persons had collected the cash from Wai Chung on 1 June 2018 in respect of the CDSA charge. They were also in possession of the amount of cash on 4 June 2018 in respect of the MOA charge.

### CDSA Charge – Money represented benefits of “criminal conduct”

15     Pursuant to s 47A(1) of the CDSA, the prosecution took the position that it did not bear the burden of proving the particulars of the predicate offence (i.e. the criminal conduct) beyond reasonable doubt. It was sufficient for the prosecution to only adduce “some evidence” linking the property that the accused persons dealt with to the predicate offence.[^2]

16     The prosecution’s case was that the victims of the police impersonation scams were cheated into transferring money to Wai Chung, directly or indirectly through other intermediaries. Wai Chung has since been convicted in the State Courts on 18 January 2019 for an offence under s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA in respect of his role in handing over the money collected from the victims to the accused persons on 1 June 2018. The prosecution’s case was that the money that Wai Chung handed over to the accused persons were the proceeds of the predicate cheating offences committed against these victims of the police impersonation scams.

17     The prosecution’s case was further that the accused persons were working for Richard who was engaged in criminal conduct and that they had reasonable grounds to believe that Richard’s benefits of his criminal conduct would be retained.

18     The prosecution’s case, as evidenced by the accused persons’ statements to the police, was that their dealings with Richard were so suspicious that an individual standing in their shoes would have had reasonable grounds to believe that he was dealing with fraudulently obtained funds. The accused persons in fact admitted in their statements, _inter alia_, that:

> (i)     there was no legitimate business purpose for them to receive such a large sum of money from Wai Chung;

> (ii)     the accused persons were offered regular monthly payments for their role in assisting Richard to receive and deal with funds;

> (iii)     the manner in which the monies was collected from Wai Chung did not look like a genuine business transaction; and more importantly, that

> (iv)     the accused persons suspected that Richard was engaged in illegal activity.

### MOA Charge – money was fraudulently obtained

19     In respect of the MOA charge, the prosecution’s case was that the accused persons had reasonable suspicion that the sum of $597,450 was fraudulently obtained and that they failed to give a satisfactory account to the police of how they came to be in possession of the money. The prosecution’s position was that the only inference which could be drawn from the circumstances of the possession and seizure was that the money had been fraudulently obtained. The money did not belong to the accused persons and they were not engaged in any lawful remittance business or for that matter, any licensed business in Singapore. The accused persons also lied about the source of the money when they were questioned by the police at the time of the seizure and arrest.

## Prosecution’s Evidence

### Facts Not in Dispute

20     The following summary of facts were not materially disputed.

21     Thus, it was not disputed that Richard had asked the accused persons to come to Singapore to collect cash for him in Singapore. He paid them a monthly salary to do so. The accused persons received instructions through group chat messages sent to their phones by a “Loong Ge” who was Richard’s assistant.

22     Following these instructions, the accused persons collected cash at the shop from various persons between May 2018 till about 2 June 2018. They were arrested on 4 June 2018.

23     In particular, on 1 June 2018, the accused persons received instructions to collect cash from someone who was later established to be Wai Chung. A photograph of the serial number of a Singapore two-dollar note was sent to the group chat to be used for identification at the time of collection. Wai Chung met Poon at the shop on the same day at 6:44 p.m. They identified each other by way of the serial number that was circulated to the group chat. Wai Chung then handed over the cash to Poon who counted the cash using a counting machine. As the cash was being counted, Chow returned to the shop. Wai Chung left after the cash had been counted. There was minimal conversation between Wai Chung and the accused persons. They had never met before.

24     The following day on 2 June 2018, the accused persons collected more cash from unknown persons.

25     Finally, on 4 June 2018, the police (CAD) raided the flat and arrested the accused persons who were about to leave the flat with their backpacks carrying cash.

### CDSA Charge

26     In respect of the CDSA charge, the prosecution led evidence to prove that the cash in respect of the CDSA charge was handed over by victims of police impersonation scams directly, or through other first-layer intermediaries, to Wai Chung. Wai Chung was an intermediary himself who then passed the money to the accused persons at the shop.

27     The four victims of the impersonation scams were called to testify as prosecution witnesses. They were PW1 Kang Swee Ling, PW2 Png Suat Huay, PW3 Loo Lan and P4 Wang Qian Qian. The four victims’ testimonies are summarised by the prosecution in their submission.[^3] Their testimonies were not materially disputed given the nature of the defence. The essence of the victims’ testimonies was that they had received calls from unknown persons who identified themselves as police officers and who then deceived and pressured the victims into parting with their money.

28     The first victim, PW1 Kang Swee Ling, a housewife, testified that she received a call on 1 June 2018 in the morning from a female caller who claimed to be calling from Outram Park police station. The caller spoke in Mandarin and told PW1 Kang that she was under investigations by the police in China for opening an account and laundering illegal money. The caller informed that the investigating officer will contact the witness. The witness then received an overseas call from a person who identified himself as ‘Wang’. This person also sent a photo of himself in police uniform to the witness. ‘Wang’ said he had arrested a suspect who claimed that the witness had sold her credit card details for money-laundering purposes. This accusation was false but it made the witness very worried. ‘Wang’ threatened to freeze the witness’s accounts and assets and requested her to transfer money for ‘verification’ purposes. He spoke in a threatening manner. Out of fear, the witness transferred $100,000 (which were proceeds from the sale of her property) to one Teo Pei Wen as instructed.[^4] She lodged a police report[^5] in the evening of 1 June 2018 when she could not contact ‘Wang’ and realised that she had been cheated. Her evidence was not disputed by the defence.

29     The second victim, PW2 Png Suat Huay, was also a housewife in her fifties. She lodged a police report on 2 June 2018 that she had been similarly cheated.[^6] She testified that she received a call the day before from someone who identified himself to be a police officer from China. He sent the witness his identification document with the purported logo of the Police Headquarters of China. He falsely accused the witness of having sold her credit card details to a suspect and said her card was being used illegally. He instructed the witness to withdraw money from her accounts failing which he would freeze her accounts. He also warned the witness that she would be sentenced to five years jail if she did not follow his instructions. Out of fear, the witness withdrew a total of $270,000 (comprising of fixed deposits) and handed the money to an unknown man who was waiting for her outside the bank. Her evidence was not disputed by the defence.

30     The third victim, PW3 Loo Lan, told of a similar ruse. She was a 69- year old housewife who had lodged a police report of being cheated.[^7] She testified that she received a call on 30 May 2018 from someone claiming to be from Interpol, China. This person spoke in Mandarin and alleged that the witness was complicit in child-trafficking. She was frightened. She was referred to another person claiming to be from the Public Security Bureau of China. The witness was also accused of having sold her credit card details to a bank employee which was not true. The witness was referred to a third ‘officer’ who threatened to freeze her accounts if she did not withdraw money from her accounts. In the end, the witness withdrew $15,000 from the bank and handed the money to someone at the National Stadium.

31     The fourth victim, P4 Wang Qian Qian, though not an elderly person being only 23 years old, was also similarly duped. She received a call informing that there was a parcel from China addressed to her and that it contained a credit card which was illegal. She told them the parcel did not belong to her but the caller insisted otherwise that she had to ‘settle’ the matter to avoid repercussions. The witness was asked to contact the customs authorities in China. The caller offered to link her up with the said Chinese authorities. The victim then received a call from a ‘Li Zhenghao’ who said that he was investigating the matter. The victim provided this person with her bank account details in order to prove that the illegal credit card did not belong to her. She also withdrew a total of $7,700[^8] on 31 May 2018 as instructed and was further instructed to hand over the money to an ‘investigator’ at Bright Hill Temple. The witness lodged a police report when she eventually realised that she had been cheated.

32     In summary, the above four victims were cheated and deceived into withdrawing cash totalling almost $393,000 which was then passed on either directly or indirectly to Wai Chung. The defence did not dispute their evidence but sought only to establish from some of the victims or intermediaries whether the cash were in $100 notes or predominantly so. The point that the defence was trying to establish will be examined in due course.

33     Two of these four victims (PW3 Loo Lan and P4 Wang Qian Qian) met Wai Chung in person and handed over $15,000 and $7,700 directly to him respectively on 30 and 31 May 2018. PW3 Loo Lan and Wai Chung identified each other’s photographs in court. PW4 Wang Qian Qian and Wai Chung also confirmed that they met at a certain temple where the former handed over cash to the latter.

34     The other two victims, PW1 Kang Swee Ling and PW2 Png Suat Huay, testified that they handed over or transferred $100,000 and $270,000 to first-layer intermediaries PW5 Teo Pei Wen and PW6 Lu Wei Cai respectively. These intermediaries testified that they were similarly deceived and instructed by police impersonators to receive the money from the two victims.

35     One of the two first-layer intermediaries was PW5 Teo Pei Wen, a 21-year old cashier. She testified that she received a call from a female who identified herself as ‘Zhang’ from Interpol. She accused PW5 Teo of selling her bank card to a syndicate. PW5 Teo was frightened and said that she did not do so. ‘Zhang’ then requested for PW5 Teo’s bank account details. ‘Zhang’ also said that the syndicate would be transferring money into PW5 Teo’s account and instructed PW5 Teo to withdraw the said money. Thereafter, as instructed, PW5 Teo withdrew a total of $100,000 from her account[^9] and handed the money to Wai Chung at the National Stadium. She was told that Wai Chung was also from Interpol.

36     The second first-layer intermediary was PW6 Lyu Wei Cai, a 35-year old Chinese national who was working here as a cook. He testified that he received a call purportedly from the Chinese Interpol and spoke to two persons, ‘Lu’ and ‘Zhang’. They requested PW6 Lyu to assist in the investigation of a money-laundering case. PW6 Lyu agreed to assist and as instructed, he met the second victim, PW2 Png, outside a UOB branch on 1 June 2018 and collected a total of $270,000 in cash from her. He also took a photograph[^10] of the victim and sent it to ‘Zhang’ who then instructed him to hand the money to Wai Chung at St Andrew’s Church.

37     The following diagram depicts the money trail from the victims as described above:[^11]

![]([2020] SGDC 0279_Image/[2020] SGDC 0279_image1.png)

38     The testimonies of the two intermediaries that they handed over the money (totalling $369,900) to Wai Chung on 1 June 2018 was not disputed by the defence except that for PW6 Lyu, the defence alleged that he was part of the syndicate. PW6 Lyu denied the insinuation. The defence also asked if the cash was in $100 notes. In any event, the sum of $369,900 formed the subject-matter of the CDSA charge against the accused persons. This sum of money comprised the two sums of money ($99,900 and $270,000) that the two intermediaries had received from the first two victims and handed over to Wai Chung and which was then handed over to the accused persons at the shop.[^12] The prosecution did not include, as part of the subject of the CDSA charge, the smaller sums of money that were received from the other two victims.

39     Wai Chung’s testimony was that he handed over the money that he had collected from PW5 Teo and PW6 Lyu, to the accused Poon at the shop located at The Arcade. Chow returned to the shop as the money was being counted. At least $369,900 were handed over to Poon in a white plastic bag. The money comprised of the money obtained from the victims and therefore represented proceeds of crime.

40     It was not in dispute that Wai Chung was prosecuted and dealt with for his role in receiving money from the victims. He pleaded guilty on 18 January 2019 to a charge under s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA and was sentenced to 40 months’ imprisonment.

41     The prosecution also led evidence to prove that the accused persons were in fact runners employed by and assisting Richard, their ‘Lao Ban’, in his money-laundering operation. The accused persons were asked to come to Singapore to facilitate Richard’s money-laundering activities. The arrangement in Singapore was such that the accused persons would receive instructions through an intermediary, ‘Loong Ge’, to collect cash from individuals and to hand over the money to other individuals or to carry out bank transfers of money. The accused persons were also instructed to register a shell company and to open a corporate account in order to carry out the money-laundering activities under the guise of a legitimate business. It was not in dispute that neither Richard nor the accused persons were licensed to provide any form of financial services in Singapore.

42     They did so in Singapore between May 2018 until they were arrested on 4 June 2018. They were told to operate from the shop at The Arcade. It was not in dispute that the shop was not in operations in that it was not open to the public for business. The accused persons claimed that the shop was being renovated. In any event, as noted earlier, it was not in dispute that there was no license to run any money remittance or currency exchange business in Singapore. Richard paid the accused persons a salary for their role.

43     The statements of the accused persons were admitted, after an ancillary hearing, to prove that the accused persons had reasonable grounds to believe that Richard was engaged in criminal conduct. There were multiple red flags which indicated to the accused persons that Richard was engaging in criminal activities. They admitted in their statements that they suspected that Richard was in fact involved in money-laundering.

44     The accused persons therefore had reasonable grounds to believe that they were facilitating Richard to retain benefits of his criminal conduct.

### MOA Charge

45     In respect of the MOA charge, evidence was led that on 4 June 2018, a team of officers from the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”) visited the accused persons’ residence at Blk 318 Ubi Ave 1, #XXX, Singapore (“the flat”). The accused persons were about to leave the flat and were each carrying a backpack filled with cash totalling $597,450 (“MOA money”). They were questioned regarding the source and ownership of the money. When they were unable to provide the CAD officers with a satisfactory explanation as to why they were in possession of such a large amount of money, they were placed under arrest and the MOA money was seized.

46     The CAD officers reasonably suspected that the seized cash was fraudulently obtained given the following unusual circumstances at the time of the arrest of the accused persons:

> i.     the accused persons were carrying a large amount of cash and leaving a modest, unremarkable and residential public housing flat; and

> ii.     the cash comprised of huge wads of notes bound by rubber bands and stuffed into two backpacks, without any form of security or protection.

47     In addition, much suspicion was aroused when they were asked about the source of the money. Thus, Poon did not respond whereas Chow claimed that the money belonged to them. They then informed that the money comprised of cash that was handed over to them on 1 June 2018 by Wai Chung and by other unknown persons at the shop between 1 and 2 June 2018. All the cash was collected for Richard’s business. The CAD officers did not accept their conflicting and inconsistent explanations.

### Statements of Accused Persons

#### (i) Chow’s Statements

48     A total of six statements were recorded by CAD from Chow. Counsel for the defence had informed the court that the defence was not challenging the voluntariness of the statements and had no objections to the statements being admitted in evidence. No allegations of any threat, inducement or promise (“TIP”) were raised by counsel. On that basis and by consent of the parties, the statements were admitted in evidence as voluntary statements in the course of the prosecution’s case. However, after the defence was called and only when Chow was cross-examined by the DPP, Chow changed his position and alleged that the statements had not been given voluntarily. I therefore directed for an ancillary hearing to be held in respect of the statements. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were provided voluntarily by Chow and I re-admitted all the statements in evidence.[^13]

#### Ancillary hearing for Chow’s statements

49     The prosecution recalled the recorders of the statements, PW7 Derrick and PW10 Ryan, to testify as to the circumstances of the recording of the statements. PW7 Derrick recorded the first statement (P16) and PW10 Ryan recorded the remaining statements.

50     In summary, Chow alleged that:

> a.     he was not allowed to amend his statements;

> b.     the contents did not reflect what he said;

> c.     the statements were not recorded on the dates which appear on the statements;

> d.     the recorders promised to mitigate and go easy on him if he cooperated; and

> e.     would slam on the table and threaten to make matters worse for him if he refused.

Essentially, Chow alleged that he was both induced and threatened by the recorders to co-operate and he signed his statements, and that apart from the first statement, the remaining statements were recorded at one go.

51     The recorders both testified that there was no TIP made to Chow. I found that both recorders were truthful and had little reason to prevaricate. For example, it was rightly pointed out by the prosecution that PW10 Ryan conceded that Chow did ask how long he would be imprisoned but the recorder replied that he was not in any position to advise the accused. The recorder’s account of events was also consistent with his field diary which was not disputed by counsel.[^14]

52     As for PW7 Derrick, it was also not disputed that his role in the investigations was very limited apart from recording only one statement from the accused.[^15] He therefore had very little vested interest to set the accused up or threaten or induce him to confess.

53     I also considered that the accused generally agreed, during cross-examination, that the recorders did read the statements back to him. He also conceded that they gave him the opportunity to amend his statements. This would be consistent with and supported by the evidence of the recorders that the statements were voluntarily given and properly recorded. I therefore accepted the testimonies of the recorders as being the truth.

54     On the other hand, Chow’s evidence was completely illogical and fraught with inconsistencies, apart from the fact that his position completely contradicted his initial instructions to counsel regarding the voluntariness of his statements.

55     He made many allegations of TIP against both recording officers which I found to be exaggerated and embellished. I therefore found that his allegations were groundless and concocted and further, the accused would have had every reason to lie to weasel out of the statements which the defence had not objected to from the start. The about-turn which he made as to voluntariness of the statements after his defence was called and when he was crossed-examined was testament to the unreliability of Chow’s allegations of TIP. It was clear to me that when confronted by the learned DPP with the admissions he made in his statements, he was desperate and decided to come up with these allegations of TIP, which were obviously contrary to his instructions to his counsel up till that point in time.

56     The fact that the allegations were fabricated at the eleventh hour is demonstrated in Chow’s evidence which was rather vague as regards the threats or promises that were made to him. For example, he was unclear about what the recorder allegedly wanted him to confess. Many of the allegations of TIP were also conspicuously not put to the recorders. Throughout his evidence, the accused kept vacillating between whether the statements were involuntary or that they were concocted by the recorders. At one point, he had to be led in examination-in-chief by his counsel before he could say that one of the answers was not made by him. He also vacillated between whether he was aware of the inaccuracies in the statements when he signed the statements or whether he only found out about them some nine months later when the statements were made available to the defence. He clearly would have been aware of the inaccuracies (if any) at the time of the recording because he could read the statements for himself. As I had observed, despite his claim during his evidence-in-chief that he was unable to read English, I noticed (as did the DPP) that during cross-examination, the accused read his statements on his own and merely required the interpreter to explain one or two English words. This was yet another illustration that the accused is an inveterate liar.

57     With reference to the allegations against PW7 Derrick, the single statement which he recorded was in parts favourable to the accused. Therefore, when asked by the DPP how he would have re-phrased the statement had there been no coercion, the accused could not and did not offer any substantive changes to the statement.

58     I also found the allegations against PW9 Ryan to be unsubstantiated and difficult to believe. Despite the alleged threats and threatening behaviour, the accused conceded that the recorder had read the statements back to him and had also explained the jurat before asking the accused to sign on the statements. I found that the allegations of the threats did not sit well with that concession i.e. I found it incredible that the recorder would threaten the accused but would yet take pains to read the statements to accused. I did not see why the recorder would bother to do so if was indeed true that he had made threats against the accused in the first place. Therefore, the accused’s acknowledgement that the recorder had read the statements to him was more consistent with the recorder’s evidence that the statements had been properly recorded. Accordingly, I also rejected the accused’s allegations that all the statements were recorded at one go and not on the different dates as reflected in the statements. It was most likely that the accused may have been confused by the fact that the two cautioned statements[^16] under s 23 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68)(“CPC”) in respect of both charges would have been recorded from him on the same occasion which probably led him to make the allegation, albeit misconceived, that all his statements were recorded at the same time.

59     I also agreed with prosecution’s submission that when the two cautioned statements were recorded and served on him, it would have been obvious that he was then being charged with the two charges and that the recorder’s promises (as alleged) to help him or to reduce the number of charges were therefore illusory and cannot be taken seriously. Despite this realisation, the accused nonetheless expressed remorse for his offences in the statements and asked for leniency. Therefore, I found that even if there had been any TIP, these did not operate on the accused’s mind and did not give him reasonable ground for supposing that he would gain any advantage or suffer any disadvantage.

#### (ii) Poon’s Statements

60     Three of Poon’s statements were admitted in evidence by consent as voluntary statements.[^17] An ancillary hearing was conducted in respect of a fourth statement to determine whether the statement was given voluntarily. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the said statement was provided voluntarily by Poon and I admitted it in evidence.[^18]

#### Ancillary hearing for Poon’s statement

61     The fourth statement was a cautioned statement recorded from Poon under s 22 of the CPC. The statement was recorded by PW9 ASP David Tan on 5 June 2018. PW9 David was also referred to as “IO David” in the course of the ancillary hearing.

62     The allegations made by Poon against IO David were essentially that the recorder induced him to make a statement by promising _inter alia_ to plead for leniency on Poon’s behalf, reducing the sentence and reducing the severity of or the number of charges against him. Poon also alleged that the recorder told him that the police already knew what Poon and Richard were up to and that Poon had better co-operate or else the police would increase the number of charges. Finally, it was also alleged that some parts of the statement were different from what he had said. For example, he told IO David that he (Poon) did not think that his boss, Richard, was involved in any illegal activities. However, the statement was recorded otherwise i.e. that Poon thought Richard was involved in illegal activities.

63     IO David denied all these allegations. As a preliminary observation, many of Poon’s allegations were more relevant to the issue of the weight to be given to the statement (or portions of the statement) rather than the voluntariness of the statement. Thus, when Poon was cross-examined, he alleged that some parts of the answers were not given by him and other parts were not accurately recorded. These allegations were irrelevant to the question of whether the statement was voluntarily provided by him. Accordingly, I did not consider these allegations insofar as the issue of voluntariness was concerned.

64     Another preliminary observation that I made, and I agreed with the submission by the prosecution in this regard, was that words to the effect of “you had better tell the truth” do not automatically constitute an inducement, threat or promise which vitiates voluntariness (_Ismail bin Abdul Rahman v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 74</span> at \[86\]). IO David was conducting investigations and to ascertain the truth of the matter. Even if he had said those words, it would not (without more) amount to a threat or inducement.

65     In any event, these allegations (i.e. that the police already knew about Poon and Richard’s illegal activities and that IO David threatened to increase the number of charges if Poon did not cooperate) were not even put to the recorder by the defence counsel. Poon only came up with these allegations after he took the stand during the ancillary hearing. It was also correctly pointed out by the prosecution that how these allegations, even if true, had affected Poon was not entirely clear or ventilated. Even though Poon claimed that IO David had repeatedly cajoled him to co-operate, it was never made clear by the defence whether Poon only provided a confession as a consequence of the threats and not otherwise.

66     I further found that the other allegations were vague, largely devoid of details and constantly being altered, shaped and embellished. Poon conceded that IO David did not actually spell out the charges that he had allegedly threatened to level at Poon. When pressed during cross-examination, Poon claimed that IO David told him “_for example, if_ \[Poon\] _had two charges_, \[IO David\] _would reduce one._” I found this testimony to be completely unconvincing. Even if IO David had said that to the accused, it is entirely doubtful if the accused (or anyone in the accused’s position) would have taken IO David’s words seriously. Therefore, the threat (had it been made) would not have operated on Poon’s mind.

67     I also rejected Poon’s claim that he was frightened during the recording of the statement. I observed that despite his youth, he was not as vulnerable or innocent as he would like the court to believe. He certainly had the courage and presence of mind to request IO David to make corrections to his statement.

68     I also found Poon’s testimony and allegations to be inconsistent, conflicting and confused. For example, he advanced two inconsistent claims with regards to the inaccuracies in the statement. On the one hand, he said he was aware at the time of recording that the statement was inaccurate. On the other hand, he also said that he found out that the statement was inaccurate some nine months later when he asked his mother’s friend to interpret the statement to him. When confronted with the inconsistent positions and asked which was the correct position, he provided another twist to the allegation saying that when the statement was interpreted to him by the said friend of his mother, he then realised that the recorder had omitted to record some portion of what he said. In any event, I observed and found that Poon was able to read the statement in court. Except for one or two words where he asked the court interpreter to explain to him, he was able to read almost the entire statement on his own.

69     Therefore, his allegations that he only found out about the inaccuracies or missing parts must be untrue and made up. Accordingly, I found Poon to be an unreliable and incredible witness and I rejected his allegations. I agreed with prosecution’s submission that Poon’s allegations of TIP are groundless and mere afterthoughts. I also noted that when a subsequent statement (P23) was recorded from Poon, he was provided an opportunity to amend his earlier statement but he did not do so. This showed that he had no issues with the said earlier statement.

70     On the other hand, I accepted that IO David’s evidence was resolute and consistent. I found him to be truthful and accepted his testimony that no TIP was made to Poon. He was fair-minded and did not attempt to embellish his evidence even if was not able to remember the details. He was also candid enough to entertain the possibility that Poon might have been nervous considering that it was his first experience in providing a police statement but IO David denied threatening Poon into making the statement. I accepted IO David’s testimony that the statement was properly and accurately recorded. This was entirely consistent with the length of time taken to record the statement.

71     Having admitted all the statements of both accused persons in evidence, I will elaborate on the relevant portions of the statements below.

## Defence Case

72     Essentially, the accused persons claimed that Richard ran legitimate businesses in Malaysia, and that they were merely his employees. Further, most of Richard’s customers in Singapore were licensed moneychangers. Hence, they believed that the money-collection activities which they engaged in on Richard’s behalf in Singapore, were legitimate

73     Insofar as the events on 1 June 2018 are concerned, the accused persons believed that Wai Chung was just another customer from a licensed moneychanger. The accused persons claimed they had no grounds to believe that the CDSA cash constituted proceeds of crime in any way. After receiving the CDSA cash from Wai Chung, they passed most of that cash to a licensed moneychanger in The Arcade before returning to their flat.

74     The accused persons further claimed that on 2 June 2018, they met another customer at the shop and collected a sum in excess of $500,000 from him. When the accused persons were arrested on 4 June 2018, the MOA money found in their possession largely originated from the cash collection on 2 June 2018 and not 1 June 2018. Their explanations to the arresting officers at the scene and their oral testimonies satisfactorily explained how they came by the MOA money.

## Court’s Findings and Decision

### Elements of the CDSA Charge

75     The applicable law is not in dispute.

76     The seminal case setting out the legal principles applicable to offences under s 44 of the CDSA charge would be the High Court decision in _Ang Jeanette v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1</span> (“_Ang Jeanette”_). The facts and circumstances in _Ang Jeanette_ were as follows. The accused in that case was charged with five counts under s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA for remitting more than $2m on various occasions to A, having received the money in Singapore from B on the instructions of C. She claimed trial to the charges. At the trial, the prosecution called an investigator from the United States (“US”) to testify. The US investigator gave evidence that fraud had been committed in the US involving hundreds of victims who had transferred money to various foreign bank accounts, including bank accounts in Singapore. Unlike the present case, none of the victims in _Ang Jeanette_ were called to testify in Singapore. Notwithstanding that, at the conclusion of the trial in _Ang Jeanette_, the accused was convicted on the evidence of the US investigator that the money that was transferred to the Singapore accounts was in fact derived from such fraud.

77     The conviction was upheld by the High Court which had no difficulty accepting the US investigator’s evidence that bank fraud, involving the US accounts from which moneys had been transferred to the Singapore accounts, had occurred.[^19] The High Court held that an element of the _actus reus_ of the CDSA offence was that the moneys were benefits of criminal conduct. In order to show criminal conduct, the prosecution must adduce some evidence to link the moneys to some act that might constitute one or other of the offences (or classes thereof) listed in the Second Schedule to the CDSA (“predicate offence”).[^20] An offence of cheating would be one such predicate offence.

78     The High Court made it clear that “it is not necessary for the Prosecution to satisfy the court beyond a reasonable doubt that all the constituent elements of a specific offence listed in the Second Schedule \[of the CDSA\] have been met.”[^21] The court further stated that “\[t\]here is no reason to assume that Parliament intended the Prosecution to go through the awkward and costly exercise of summoning foreign witnesses to prove all the ingredients of a foreign offence when these predicate offences are often in practice difficult to pin down.”[^22]

79     The High Court was satisfied that the prosecution had adduced enough evidence that convincingly showed that the persons who committed the bank fraud procured the movement of funds from the US bank accounts with the intention to dishonestly take those funds out of the possession of the rightful US bank account-holders. The High Court was of the view that this constituted either theft or cheating under the Penal Code. The High Court said that “_the persons who procured the transfer of moneys from the US bank accounts by impersonation had done so by deception and had fraudulently or dishonestly induced the bank officers in the US so deceived to deliver the moneys to the holders of the Singapore banks’ accounts in question; in other words, cheating (as it is defined in s 415 of the Penal Code) had occurred. The moneys which were transferred into the Singapore bank accounts from the US bank accounts can be seen as “stolen property”, i.e., the property the possession whereof has been transferred by theft, or in respect of which cheating has been committed, whether the transfer has been made or cheating has been committed within or without Singapore, as defined under s 410(1) of the Penal Code_.”[^23]

80     There was, of course, no issue of sufficiency of evidence in the present case. The four victims were called as prosecution witnesses and they testified that they were the victims of police impersonation scams as described above. Their evidence was not materially disputed by the defence.

81     In summary, the High Court in _Ang Jeannette_ held that:

> a.     the prosecution is to prove, as an element of the _actus reus_ of the offence under s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA, that the money was benefit of criminal conduct;

> b.     in order to prove that money was derived from criminal conduct, there must be some evidence to link the money with some act that might constitute a predicate offence, from which the money was derived and in which the other person was or had engaged, or from which such other person had benefited;

> c.     there could also be circumstances where the only logical and reasonable inference is that the money involved in the arrangement was criminal property, and that the other person had engaged in or benefited from the criminal conduct;

> d.     the prosecution does not have to satisfy all the elements of the predicate offence beyond a reasonable doubt;

> e.     if the elements of the _actus reus_ of the s 44(1)(a) CDSA offence are made out, it will generally not be difficult to establish that the impugned arrangement facilitated the retention or control by or on behalf of the other person of his benefits of criminal conduct;

> f.     having “reasonable grounds to believe” involved a “lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation”; and

> g.     the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved but must reason from that position like an objective reasonable man.

82     In the present case in respect of the CDSA charge, the prosecution has to prove the following key elements beyond reasonable doubt, in addition to the element of common intention under s 34 of the Penal Code i.e. that:

> a.     they received money from Wai Chung which represented benefits of “criminal conduct”;

> b.     the accused persons had reasonable grounds to believe that (i) Richard engaged in criminal conduct; and (ii) they were part of an arrangement which facilitated Richard to retain the benefits of criminal conduct.

### (a)   Money received were benefits of criminal conduct

83     At the outset, the defence did not seriously dispute this and I found that the victims were cheated of their money. As depicted in the diagram of the money trail set out above, I found that the victims’ money made their way directly, or through another layer of money-mules, to Wai Chung.

84     It was also not disputed and I found that the accused persons did receive money from Wai Chung. The accused persons accepted that they were working for Richard and that they received the money from Wai Chung by Richard through Loong Ge. What was in dispute was whether they knew or had reasonable grounds to believe that the money was derived from criminal conduct and also that Richard was engaged in such conduct. Therefore, I found that the element of common intention by both accused in receiving the money from Wai Chung was made out.

85     The defence’s case appeared to suggest that the money that Wai Chung handed over to the accused persons was not the same cash that Wai Chung had received from the victims. The implication was that Wai Chung had disposed of the victims’ money instead of handing it over to the accused persons. I rejected this suggestion which was nothing but conjecture and speculation. I accepted Wai Chung’s testimony that he received the money from the victims and the money-mules and thereafter gave the money to the accused persons on 1 June 2018. He did not spend or keep any of the money which was collected. More importantly, as rightly pointed out by the prosecution, the defence did not put or even suggest to Wai Chung that he had kept some of the money or that the money handed over to the accused persons did not originate from the victims. Therefore, his evidence as to the source of the money was unchallenged.

86     I accepted Wai Chung’s testimony insofar as the collection and handing over of the money to the accused persons was concerned. He did not know the accused persons and has never met them before. There was no suggestion that he had any reason or motive to lie or implicate them. He has in fact pleaded guilty to his charge and had already been sentenced for his role. He had nothing to gain by telling untruths or implicating the accused persons. His testimony was consistent and credible.

87     I was satisfied from the collective evidence of the victims and the intermediaries (PW1 – PW6) including Wai Chung’s evidence, that the money which formed the subject-matter of the CDSA charge was derived from the police impersonation scams. Therefore, I found that the said money constituted benefits of criminal conduct.

### (b)   Accused persons had reason to believe they facilitated Richard’s retention of benefits

88     The next key issues may be taken together as the core issue of the entire case i.e. whether the accused persons had reasonable grounds to believe that the money which was the subject matter of the CDSA charge constituted benefits of Richard’s criminal conduct and that they were facilitating Richard to retain these benefits by collecting the money for him.

#### Reason to believe

89     The _mens rea_ of having "reason to believe" (or reasonable ground to believe) involves a "lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation": _Ow Yew Beng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 536</span> at \[10\]. This point was very recently reiterated by Hoo J. in her oral judgment in _PP v Yeo Kong Meow_ (MA 9289 of 2019 at \[13\]).

90     I agreed with prosecution’s submission and it was clear from the evidence that there were more than sufficient red flags planted around the suspicious and shady nature of Richard’s business and the circumstances of how the accused persons had assisted in that business. I found that these red flags, collectively, would have given cause to a reasonable person standing in the shoes of accused person to believe that Richard was engaging in criminal conduct and that the money handed to them by Wai Chung were benefits of Richard’s criminal conduct, and therefore, they were facilitating the retention by Richard of the said benefits.

#### Reds flag – Richard’s illegal activities in Malaysia

91     Notwithstanding their claims on the witness stand, both accused persons admitted in their statements (which were admitted in evidence) that they suspected that Richard, who was their boss, was involved in illegal activities in Malaysia i.e. unlicensed moneylending and money laundering.

92     Thus, Chow made the following admission in his statement (P33):

>   
| 

Question 3:

 | 

Why did these two persons give you the cash?

 |
| 

Answer:

 | 

Sometime around November or December 2017, my boss in Malaysia by the name of Richard Yeah (+60 XXX) instructed me to come to Singapore to work in a money-changer. My boss said he was going to open a money-changer here in Singapore. At that time, my boss was already involved with a secret society in Malaysia, doing unlicensed money-lending. I came to Singapore and stayed in a rented flat in Clementi at that time. During my time in Singapore, I would receive instructions from one 'Loong' (+60 XXX) who is Richard's right-hand man.

 |
| 

Question 7:

 | 

Are these monies related to criminal activities?

 |
| 

Answer:

 | 

I am not sure where the monies came from as I did not dare to ask. But given that Loong and my big boss both have close links to the secret society in Malaysia, it is possible that my big boss is helping the secret society there to launder money over here

 |

  
  

93     Likewise, Poon stated the following in his statement (P25):

>   
| 

Question 7:

 | 

What do you know about Lao Ban?

 |
| 

Answer:

 | 

I think he is involved in illegal activities, like money laundering. I did not put too much thought into it as I needed the money. I was paid S$1,500 a month. Kent would pass me the money in cash every month.

 |

  
  

94     Even though the accused persons tried very hard to impugn the accuracy of their statements, I found that the statements accurately reflected what they had told the recorders. Accordingly, I gave full weight to the statements as highlighted in respect to their harboured suspicions concerning Richard’s connection with the secret society and his illegal activities.

95     Thus, I rejected Chow’s claim that his answers were not accurately recorded. I agreed with the prosecution that he vacillated on his position regarding the accuracy of the recording of his statement (P33) in the course of the trial, just as and as much as he had shifted his position on the voluntariness of his statements. His stance with regard to the accuracy of the statement altered drastically from having no specific allegations during the prosecution’s case to disputing the statement’s accuracy at a very late stage during cross-examination after his defence was called.

96     I also noted that Chow’s instructions to his counsel contradicted his own testimony. Thus, counsel put to the recorder during the ancillary hearing that all Chow had said was that he saw Richard with members of secret society.[^24] However, Chow testified that this information was fabricated by the recorder. Chow then conceded in cross-examination that Richard was seen with secret society members in Malaysia.[^25] This flip-flop in evidence clearly showed that Chow was not a credible witness. It also showed that Chow saw Richard associate with secret society elements and therefore, Chow would have been put on notice that Richard may be engaging in criminal activities.

97     In respect of Poon, I also rejected his contention that what he told the recorder was “_I_ **_don’t_** _think he (i.e. “Richard’) is involved in illegal activities, like money laundering_” (emphasis added).[^26] Furthermore, it was not put to the recorder that he had changed the meaning of the sentence by converting a denial into an affirmation by omitting the phrase “don’t”. It was also not put to the recorder that he did not read or had inaccurately read the statement back to Poon or that Poon was not allowed to change the sentence. The fact remained, and I so found, that Poon was given an opportunity to amend this sentence but did not do so. I also found that Poon was able to read the statement in English (as he had done so during the trial) and he understood what was written but he chose not to amend the sentence in question.

#### Red flags –Richard’s unlicensed activities in Singapore

98     Richard was never identified by the defence or called to give evidence as a defence witness. Considering the defence’s claim that Richard was a relative of Poon, the said claim was certainly cast in much doubt when this person was not even called and did not come forward to exonerate the accused persons.

99     Putting that aside, there were certainly a number of red flags surrounding Richard’s business in Singapore and what the accused persons were told to do to facilitate that business. It was not in dispute that the accused persons were employed by Richard and instructed to come to Singapore to help set up his business. Thus, Chow said in his statement that he was asked to come to Singapore to set up a money-changing business here.[^27] The accused persons took over a shop space at The Arcade. Chow further said that he was instructed to meet various persons at The Arcade and collected money from them which was then passed on to other persons or deposited into a bank account. Poon’s account of their role in Singapore was similar i.e. to collect money from customers and deposit the money into bank accounts.[^28]

100    It would have been obvious to the accused persons, or to any reasonable person in their shoes for that matter, that what they were being asked to do did not resemble money-changing transactions. There were multiple clear red flags here. For one thing, the transactions did not involve foreign currencies. All the cash collected and transferred or deposited into bank accounts were Singapore dollars. Another clear red flag, and this was not disputed, was that Richard did not have a license to carry out a money-changing business in Singapore.

101    Yet another red flag, and perhaps the clearest and brightest, must be that they were ‘operating’ from and collecting money within the shop at The Arcade which was not even open to the public for any kind of business, let alone money-changing business. In other words, it ought to have struck them that the shop space was merely being used as a front or shell for Richard to conduct his business. The accused persons claim that the shop was being renovated but no evidence was produced in support of that claim. In short, the accused persons were ostensibly tasked to start a money-changing business without a valid license and they conducted transactions in an empty shop which was not open to the public for business and which transactions were not activities in relation to any money-changing business. These circumstances ought to have put them on notice that they were not in fact being employed to run a legitimate money-changing business.

102    It was pointed out by the prosecution and which I agreed that during the course of the trial, the accused persons’ instructions to their counsel as to the nature of Richard’s business constantly shifted. This was demonstrated by the different versions of the questions that were put to the recording officers. Thus, it was put to one recorder that it was a money-remittance or moneylending business.[^29] It was also put to another recorder that it was money-changing and money-remittance business.[^30] The defence case became even more amorphous when it was then put to a third recorder that it was either a money-remittance or moneylending[^31] or even that the money received were from “business dealings with clients.”[^32]

103    The inconsistent and changing ‘put’ questions showed and I found that the accused persons did not believe that Richard was operating a legitimate business. They were suspicious of Richard’s business as they had admitted in their statements. However, they chose to turn a blind eye to the obvious. They therefore had to resort to making up their defence as they went along and giving inconsistent and vague instructions to their counsel.

104    The accused’s testimonies were equally vague and inconsistent. Thus, Chow was unable to provide clarity as to the nature of Richard’s business. He informed the court during examination-in-chief that Richard had asked him to come to Singapore to meet with money-changing customers.[^33] During cross-examination, however, he then said that he was supposed to set up “an organization for money-exchange” in Singapore and that some Singapore customers had borrowed money from Richard’s company in Malaysia.[^34] Thus, Chow’s description of the business seemed to vacillate between money changing and moneylending.

105    Poon was also unable to throw any clearer light on Richard’s business except that it required him to collect money from unnamed and unidentified “money-changers” and thereafter to pass on the money to other unnamed and unidentified money-changers.[^35] Poon said he also had to deposit money into bank accounts in Singapore.[^36] None of these “money-changers” were called by the defence to corroborate the accused persons’ claims. No documentation was tendered to prove the bank deposits either. Whatever the nature of Richard’s business, it certainly was not a money-changing business nor any of the businesses that were variously put to the recorders and investigating officers.

106    The defence also tendered, albeit no sooner than at the trial itself, documentary exhibits (D1 and a translation, D1T) to prove that Richard operated a legitimate business in Malaysia. On the face of the document, D1 appears to be a renewal application for a moneylending license purportedly issued in Malaysia to ‘Foong Yen Capital Sdn Bhd’ (“Foong Yen”). Presumably, the accused persons were intending to show that Richard was a legitimate and licensed moneylender in Malaysia. Therefore, by extrapolation, Richard had a legitimate business in Singapore. However, I rejected this defence for a number of reasons.

107    The entity, Foong Yen, came up in evidence only after the defence was called when Chow testified in his evidence-in-chief. It was pointed out by the prosecution and I accepted that as a fact that the accused persons did not mention Foong Yen in their statements at all. I found that to be strange because if Foong Yen was Richard’s moneylending business and the accused persons were working for Richard in the business, the accused persons would have mentioned the name of Richard’s business right from the start. They did not.

108    In any event, I agreed with the prosecution that on the face of D1 (as translated in D1T), there was nothing to show or suggest that Richard or anyone named Richard was the proprietor of or even associated with Foong Yen. As mentioned above, Richard’s identity or full name was never established by the defence and neither was he called to testify as a defence witness. Therefore, I found that D1 did not assist or support the defence of the accused persons and I did not attach any weight to it.

109    For the sake of argument, even if Richard did operate Foong Yen as a legitimate moneylending company in Malaysia, the undisputed fact remained that Richard did not have any license to operate any form of moneylending, money-changing or money-remittance business in Singapore. Therefore, even if it was accepted (which is not) that Richard owned a licensed moneylending company in Malaysia, that fact was not inconsistent with Richard also engaging in money-laundering activities in Malaysia and Singapore. As such, any attempt by the accused persons to extrapolate the apparent legitimacy of Foong Yen to also cover the business dealings in Singapore must fail.

110    Ultimately, I found that the accused persons’ efforts in trying to describe and explain Richard’s business, be it Malaysia or Singapore, fell far short of their bald assertion that the said business was a legitimate money-changing business or other form of legitimate business.

#### Red flags – Illicit nature of collection and transfer of money

111    Yet more red flags would have been raised by the furtive manner in which the accused persons were required to collect and transfer money, coupled with the unusual method of identification of the party with whom they transacted.

112    Thus, both accused persons revealed in their statements[^37] and also in their testimony that before acquiring the shop, they would meet and collect cash from various persons often in secluded areas. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, even the meetings inside the shop space was no less suspicious. As may be seen from the screenshots taken from the CCTV installed within the shop, the premises were (as accurately described by the prosecution) a sparsely furnished room which did not appear to be visible or accessible by the public. Essentially, the accused persons would meet and collect money from various persons, including Wai Chung, in the privacy of this room away from the scrutiny of the public. In other words, the transactions were not conducted openly or publicly over the counter unlike typical money-changing or money remittance businesses.

113    The method by which they were instructed to verify the identity of the other party from whom they were collecting money would itself have caused any reasonable person to be suspicious i.e. by way of the serial number of a two-dollar Singapore note which was circulated via a group chat.[^38] This was the only means of identification which preserved the respective parties’ anonymity because they would not have met the other party before and would not be told of their identity. On top of that, there was no documentation involved between them. The accused persons were not required to acknowledge receipt of the money collected in any form.

114    This was in fact how they had transacted with Wai Chung on 1 June 2018. The cavalier way in which Wai Chung was handling the large sum of cash must have struck the accused persons as oddly suspicious. He was unaccompanied by any person let alone security officers and he simply whipped a plastic bag full of cash from his backpack and handed it to one of the accused persons.

115    In summary, the accused persons were transacting with strangers in large amounts of cash without any form of security or precautionary measures. The meet ups were either in public but secluded areas or inside a shop which was not open for business. There was an absence of documentation and the manner of identification used was unorthodox and illicit, as opposed to more conventional and legitimate means of identification such as the use of personal identity documents. All these circumstances must surely have tainted the transactions with absolute suspicion.

116    In truth, the accused persons did admit in their statements that they harboured much suspicion. In respect of the large sums of money, Chow revealed that:

>     I had felt something was wrong, the amounts that Peter and myself were collecting were growing larger and larger.[^39]

117    The large sums of money were not the only thing which made him suspicious because he went on to add that:

>     Furthermore, there was no sign that we would be obtaining a money-changer licence and yet I was being told to set up bank accounts and incorporate a company. I had told Loong that I did not want to continue doing already but Loong told me that I could not just drop everything like that.[^40]

118    Poon also conceded when he was cross-examined during the trial that he was shocked by the large sums of money he had to collect.[^41] Furthermore, he revealed in his statement that he was also concerned for his personal safety in view of the large sums of money involved but was given next to no explanation as to the purpose or source of the money:

>     Kent told me that the job would be dangerous and risky because it involved large sums of money. I was suspicious as to why I was needed to handle large amounts of cash. When I heard about this I was also a bit afraid because I worried for my safety in case the customers turned nasty about the large sums of money. All I was told that the people whom I took money from were customers.[^42]

119    I also found their explanation that their “office” would handle all the backend paperwork to be entirely feeble and unsubstantiated.[^43] They repeatedly claimed in their evidence in court that the handling of documentation was not within their job scope.[^44] However, none of the so-called “paperwork” were tendered in evidence to support their explanation. Given that the nub of the accused persons’ defence was that Richard was running a legitimate business, the utter lack of any documentation in respect of any transaction would fly in the face of that defence.

120    I also rejected their claim that the unconventional method of identification was common practice amongst money-changers in Singapore.[^45] No independent evidence of such practice was furnished by the defence. The accused persons were simply making this up just as they have made up most of the other aspects of their defence.

121    In summary, given the shady and furtive circumstances in which undocumented large sums of cash were exchanged with various unknown persons using a secretive method of identification to remain anonymous, the accused persons surely cannot reasonably or credibly claim that they thought, in all honesty, that they were dealing with licensed money-changers. Even discounting the fact that none of these “money-changers” were called to testify or even identified, the accused persons were unable to explain why it was necessary to personally collect money from them and then to deposit the cash into bank accounts. They could not explain why the money could not have been transferred on a business to business basis. In fact, Chow said the transaction was between “company to company” and yet could not explain why his role was necessary.[^46] On the other hand, Poon prevaricated by saying that he was simply following instructions.[^47]

122    Ultimately, the accused persons would have realised that that they were probably mere conduits to funnel the cash along and out of the country. In other words, they probably would have at least entertained the thought that they were paid by Richard to act as money mules. Essentially, they were being paid money to move money with no questions asked and no answers provided. They would also have realised that they were asked to work in Singapore without a work permit.

123    It was all the more suspicious because it was revealed that Chow had apparently worked in Singapore for Richard previously in 2017 as a “Database Administrator” purportedly for a company called “T.M.S Inc Pte Ltd”. However, Chow was strangely unable to explain what he did as a “Database Administrator”. There was also no suggestion that this company was associated with Foong Yen. I had no difficulty finding that Chow may have worked for Richard in 2017 but it was certainly not in the role of a “Database Administrator”.

124    What would also have been puzzling to Chow was that Richard asked him to register a company “Monetage” in Singapore in order to perform telegraphic transfers of money using the company’s name and its corporate bank account. Nothing was mentioned about the money-changing business. Chow was also asked to register himself as the company’s director. Chow did not know why since he was only a salaried employee. He certainly did not ask Richard for an explanation. He clearly did not want to know and chose to be blind to the obviously suspicious circumstances.

125    Poon’s employment was no less suspicious. He claimed that he trusted Richard who was his uncle. Yet he did not appear to be able to persuade his uncle to come to court to testify to save his skin. Their familial relationship (if there was even one) was obviously not close. Strangely enough, Poon revealed in his statement that it was Chow who introduced him to this job and not Poon’s uncle.[^48] Chow also described the job as ‘dangerous and risky’ and they would meet Richard at KTV pubs in Malaysia. This relative of an uncle certainly did not appear to be a good influence or someone that Poon ought to trust. In any event, I found that Poon had made up this relationship with Richard. After all, he did not mention about Richard or any boss being his uncle in any of his statements. As pointed out by the prosecution and which I agreed, Chow talked about a relationship between Poon and the boss but it was obvious that the relationship was at best a distant relationship and not from the same side of the family.[^49] The fact that Poon was not close to Richard is clearly seen from the fact that Poon would refer to Richard as his boss throughout his statements and not his uncle. Poon also acknowledged that Richard did not have any license to run any money-changing or money-remittance business in Singapore. Yet, he was prepared to facilitate whatever unlicensed business Richard was operating in Singapore. This was not because he trusted Richard. Rather, as he has admitted in his statement, he chose to ignore his suspicions because of his greed:

>     Yes I did have doubts but I did not dwell on it that much then as I thought it was an easy way to earn money. Lao Ban and Kent told me that I was needed to accept money, deposit money into bank accounts and sometimes bring money back to Malaysia..[^50]

#### Accused had reasonable grounds to believe that Richard was engaged in criminal conduct

126    I disbelieved the accused persons’ claims in their evidence that they never had any doubts about the legality of the money which they collected for Richard. Contrary to their claim, they admitted otherwise in their statements. Earlier, I had already referred to several portions of their statements where they said they harboured suspicions and had concerns about what they were doing in Singapore. They further expressed their suspicions quite clearly in other relevant parts of their various statements.

127    Thus, when asked about his job in Singapore, Chow admitted that:

>     My boss said he was going to open a money-changer here in Singapore. At that time, my boss was already involved with a secret society in Malaysia, doing unlicensed money-lending. I came to Singapore and stayed in a rented flat in Clementi at that time. During my time in Singapore, I would receive instructions from one 'Loong' (+60 XXX) who is Richard's right-hand man.[^51]

128    When asked if the money collected was derived from criminal activities, Chow said:

>     I am not sure where the monies came from as I did not dare to ask. But given that Loong and my big boss both have close links to the secret society in Malaysia, it is possible that my big boss is helping the secret society there to launder money over here.[^52]

129    As for Poon, when asked about his boss “Lao Ban”, he replied quite frankly that:

>     I think he is involved in illegal activities, like money laundering. I did not put too much thought into it as I needed the money.[^53]

#### Statements given full weight

130    I rejected the accused persons’ allegations that their statements were not accurately recorded or were fabricated in parts. The accused persons were only now attempting to impugn the accuracy of the statements because they had incriminated themselves when providing their statements. The accused persons did not dispute that the statements were read back to them or that they were not denied the opportunity to amend their statements if there were inaccuracies or untruths. I also found that they were able to read and comprehend the contents of their statements. Yet, I found that they chose not to amend their statements. Furthermore, counsel did not specifically or with sufficient detail, put to the recorders what the accused persons did say or had wanted to say in their statements. Therefore, I concluded and found that all the statements were accurately recorded from the accused persons and I accorded full weight to them insofar as regards the accused’s admissions of their suspicions of Richard and his illegal activities, and their misgivings regarding what they were asked to do.

131    I rejected the defence arguments that the statements were inaccurate and that no weight should be given to the statements.[^54] I will address some of these arguments here.

132    First of all, it was argued that the amounts collected as stated in the statements do not tally with instructions as stated in the whatsapp messages and therefore the statements were not accurate.[^55] However, that argument is fallacious because the argument is grounded on the assumption that the amounts stated in the whatsapp messages are accurate in the first place. Since no documentary evidence was tendered by the accused persons to substantiate how much they had collected and from whom, there was simply no basis for contending that the amounts stated in the whatsapp messages are accurate. As a matter of fact, the amounts that are stated in the statements may well be inaccurate because they were either made up by the accused persons or provided by them to the best of their recollection in the absence of any documentation. Whatever the case, I was satisfied that the amounts stated in the statements were as informed by the accused persons and accurately recorded down. Ultimately, an amount of at least $369,900 was cheated from the victims. This amount was proved by the testimonies of the victims and the bank statements provided by them. This amount which is the subject-matter of the CDSA charge was collected by Wai Chung and passed on to the accused persons on 1 June 2018. Subsequently on 4 June 2018, the accused persons were found to be in possession of a larger amount of cash amounting to $597,450. This amount is the subject-matter of the MOA charge. These amounts are not in dispute

133    Ultimately, I found that the accused persons did not and were unable to give a satisfactorily account of the transactions in the interim. I did not believe that they had transacted with licensed moneychangers as they have claimed. I rejected the bald submission by the defence that it is “undisputed that various MAS-licensed moneychangers had transacted with Richard through the Accused Persons.”[^56] This claim was in fact strenuously disputed by the prosecution and completed unsubstantiated.

134    In the interim, the accused persons may have collected more money and passed along more money to various unknown persons. Accordingly, counsel’s observation that the denominations of dollar notes cheated from the victims differ from the denominations of the dollar notes that were seized from the accused persons was neither here nor there.[^57] In any case, it was never established from all the victims as to what denominated notes were handed over to Wai Chung or the intermediaries. For example, the victim PW2 Png was cheated of $270,000 which formed the bulk of the CDSA cash. She was not asked by the defence and it was not established that the cash that she handed over did not comprise of $1000 notes.[^58] In fact, since she had withdrawn the cash over the counter at the bank, the cash would more likely than not be in $1000 notes given the large amount of money. Therefore, this puts paid to defence’s contention that there was a doubt as to the ‘chain of custody’ of the cash collected from the victims.[^59] First of all, it was not established that the victims’ money were in small notes. On the contrary, it was more likely than not that the money was predominantly in $1000 notes. Secondly, the notion of ‘chain of custody’ of the cash is irrelevant and in fact antithetical to a case of money-laundering. In order to achieve the objectives of money-laundering, the perpetrators would in fact want to break or obfuscate the ‘chain of custody’.

135    I also disagreed with the defence submission that all the elements of the offences for both the CDSA and MOA charges (other than the fact that they collected money from Wai Chung and were then arrested in possession of a large sum of money) are solely supported by their statements.[^60] I have highlighted the evidence, red flags and other inferences to be drawn, apart from the admissions in the statements, which also constituted proof of the charges. As such, even if there is any doubt as to the reliability of the statements, it does not necessarily mean (as counsel had submitted) that the accused persons must necessarily be acquitted.

#### Richard was engaged in criminal conduct

136    The defence submitted that the prosecution had offered no evidence that Richard was engaged in criminal conduct.[^61] They also took issue with the fact that no charges were levelled against Richard. I rejected these fanciful but ultimately futile arguments. As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, there is no requirement as held in _Jeannette Ang_ for the prosecution to prove that a specific predicate offence has been committed. It was held in _Jeannette Ang_ at \[58\] that to prove that property is derived from or represents the benefits of criminal conduct, all that is required is “_some evidence linking the moneys in question with particular criminal conduct i.e. some act that may constitute one or more of the offences listed in the Second Schedule_”.

137    In the present case, I found that the prosecution has more than met this evidential threshold. Evidence was led from the victims who were cheated by police impersonators into transferring money which were eventually collected by the accused persons. The money trail from the victims to the accused persons was not materially disputed. Even if disputed by the defence, I found that the link was established. It was also not in dispute that the money was collected by the accused persons on the instructions of Richard through Loong Ge. In addition, the cash handed over by Wai Chung to the accused persons also formed the subject-matter of Wai Chung’s charge under s 44(1) of the CDSA for money-laundering. Therefore, I found that Richard was engaged in criminal conduct in that he was either complicit in the predicate offence of the victims being cheated by the police impersonators (i.e. an offence under s 420 of the Penal Code) or at the very least was involved in laundering the victims’ money by using money mules such as Wai Chung (i.e an offence under s 44(1) or s 47 of the CDSA).

#### Conclusion

138    In was not in dispute and I found that the accused persons had collected money and dealt with money in Singapore, including the money they received from Wai Chung, in furtherance of their common intention to help Richard’s business as instructed by Richard through Loong Ge. Given all the red flags described above in light of the highly suspicious circumstances surrounding the money transactions and considering also the suspicions and misgivings which they had candidly voiced in their statements, I found that the accused persons had more than reasonable and sufficient grounds to believe that Richard was engaged in criminal conduct and that the money they collected from Wai Chung represented the benefits of that criminal conduct, and they had facilitated Richard’s retention of the said benefits.

### MOA charge

139    I accepted the legal principles which the prosecution had set out in their submissions as being relevant to the MOA charge.[^62]

140    In essence, the court must first be satisfied from the evidence that the circumstances were such that the police officer had grounds to suspect that the property in the accused’s possession was stolen property and that such suspicion was reasonable.[^63] If so, the court must then ask itself whether the accused gave a satisfactory account of how he came by the said property. In respect of the second inquiry, the court must put itself in the position of a reasonable prudent man and ask itself whether or not the explanation given by the accused was a satisfactory explanation.

141    In deciding whether the property in question may be reasonably suspected of being stolen, such suspicion can attach to the property in a number of ways such as the nature of the property or the behaviour of the accused person.[^64]

142    I agreed with prosecution’s submission that the court would be entitled to find that an accused person has failed to account satisfactorily for how he came to be in possession of property which is reasonably suspected of being fraudulently obtained in the following situations:

> (a)     The accused does not offer any explanation to account for his possession;

> (b)     The explanation provided by the accused is untrue;

> (c)     The accused provides materially inconsistent explanations about how he came by the property; and/or,

> (d)     The accused provides an explanation that is unsupported by any proof which he ought to be able to provide.

#### Reasonable suspicion

143    In respect of the respective MOA charge against the accused persons, I was satisfied that given the circumstances in which they were found in possession of the cash which formed the subject-matter of the MOA charge, the CAD officers had reasonable grounds to suspect that the cash was stolen property or had been fraudulently obtained.

144    The circumstances surrounding the arrest of the accused persons as they were about to leave their flat were not materially disputed. Thus, the CAD officers testified that they found the accused persons carrying a backpack each filled with large wads of cash tied with rubber bands. From the photographs taken, there were three wads of cash in one backpack and four wads of cash in the other. Given the very large amount of cash ($597,450) that was being conveyed by the accused persons from a residential premise which was a modest HDB flat and with no obvious reason or purpose for doing so, the CAD officers’ suspicion was reasonably aroused that the money had been fraudulently obtained. The officers testified that ordinarily, no one would carry such huge sums of cash in such manner.[^65] There was also no accompanying documentation or any form of security or precautionary measures to protect the accused persons or the cash they were carrying.

#### No satisfactory account

145    I was further satisfied the accused persons were unable to satisfactorily account for the cash found in their possession in that the explanations they offered at various points in time were entirely unsubstantiated or inconsistent.

#### Unsatisfactory account at point of arrest

146    Thus, just before they were arrested on 4 June 2018 when they were questioned by the CAD officers at their flat, Chow said that the money belonged to them whereas Poon kept quiet.[^66] The responses were contemporaneously recorded in one of the officers’ field diary.[^67] Another officer also recalled that one of the accused persons said the money belonged to a business.[^68] Whether the money belonged to them in their capacity as employees or to Richard’s business, this was not supported by any documentary proof at that point in time. Consequently, they were placed under arrest.

#### Unsatisfactory account in statements

147    Their account in their statements trying to explain why they were in possession of the cash was woefully unsatisfactory. Essentially, they claimed that they had collected the cash in the course of working for Richard. As highlighted above, they were also aware that Richard had connections with secret society members and may be involved in illegal activities. They were also unable to explain what Richard’s business in Singapore was except that it had all the trappings of money-laundering. Additionally, they could not provide a single document to identify where the money came from or where it went. They could not identify or legitimise the source of the money they had collected or provide the reason for the collection.

148    Thus, Chow tried to explain in his statement that the cash found in their backpacks had been instructed by Richard’s deputy to collect from various persons whom the accused persons did not know.[^69] They also collected the cash from Wai Chung and they kept the cash in their flat. Apparently thereafter, they collected another sum of more than $200,000 on 2 June 2018 from another person at their shop which was also kept in the flat. On the other hand, Poon’s explanation was somewhat different in that he said that about $300,000 of the cash found in the flat came from Wai Chung and remaining $100,000 was collected by Chow from other customers or from money-changers. Poon also said that he did not know what they were supposed to do with the money that was collected from Wai Chung.[^70]

149    Given the somewhat differing accounts regarding the money collected (apart from the portion collected from Wai Chung which was obtained from fraudulent means) and the absence of any document to show that all the cash collected was from legitimate sources, the accused persons could not be said to have given a satisfactory account of their possession of the cash.

#### Unsatisfactory account in court

150    Their attempted explanations in court became even murkier and contradictory. Thus, Chow testified that after he had collected the cash from Wai Chung on 1 June 2018e, he then transferred about $500,000 to $600,000 to money-changers which he could hardly identify.[^71] Chow claimed that together with Poon, they collected more money the next day from other money-changers, including a sum of $500,000 from someone known only as ‘Xiao Gang’.[^72] He conceded that the cash which was seized on the day of the arrest may have comprised some of the cash first collected from Wai Chung on 1 June 2018.[^73]

151    Poon’s evidence was similar in that he testified that they handed over some of the money collected from Wai Chung to a licensed money-changer. The remaining cash was kept in the flat. They then collected more money the following day from other money-changers, including the said $500,000.[^74]

152    Their evidence in court appear to be more aligned, save for a sum of $80,000 that was mentioned by Poon. This was not surprising since they would have had all the time and opportunity to discuss, tailor and match their testimonies. Nonetheless, no matter how much their evidence may have dove-tailed, they did not and could not produce any of these “money-changers” to testify in support of their claims. They did not and could not produce any documentary proof that they had collected or handed over money to any of these alleged licensed money-changers.

153    Therefore, at the end of the day, I found that the accused persons have not satisfactorily explained the source of the money that formed the subject-matter of the MOA charge.

#### Adverse inference

154    In _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Fuad v Public Prosecutor_ \[2020\] SCGA 25 (“_Muhammad Nabill_”) at \[67\] and \[72\]-\[75\], the court was troubled that the prosecution had not called certain material witnesses (or furnished their statements to the defence) and restated the principle that the court may in certain circumstances be entitled to draw an adverse inference that the evidence of a material witness who could have been but was not called by the prosecution would have been unfavourable to the prosecution, if the prosecution was unable to satisfy the court that it had good reason not to call that witness. This legal principle would likewise apply to the defence if the defence similarly fails to call a material witness without good reason. On the facts in _Muhammad Nabill_, the court noted that the witnesses who were not called were material witnesses because they could be expected to confirm or, conversely, contradict the accused’s defence in that case.

155    In the present case, I too found it troubling and in fact most telling, that the defence had failed to call Richard (allegedly Poon’s uncle) as a witness to buttress the key ingredient of the accused persons’ defence i.e. that Richard was operating a legitimate business and the accused persons were innocent employees working for him. The said Richard would have been a very material witness for the defence. If he was called, he would have been able to confirm the claims of the accused persons. He would also have been able to provide all the documentary proof to support the accused persons’ claims that they were transacting with licensed moneychangers all this while.

156    However, Richard was not called to give evidence and no reasons were given by the defence for not doing so. Given that the accused persons did not provide any ground for not calling this very material witness for the defence, I was compelled to draw an adverse inference against the accused persons, both as a principle enunciated in _Muhammed Nabill_ and also under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act i.e. that the evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the defendant. For the avoidance of any doubt, the adverse inference applied to both the CDSA charge as well as the MOA charge since Richard would have been a material witness for both charges. In fact, the only logical inference to be drawn would be that Richard was not who the accused persons had described him to be.

## Conclusion

157    In respect of the CDSA charge, I found the evidence of all the prosecution witnesses to be credible and truthful and I accepted their evidence. The evidence of the victims was not materially disputed in any case. As for evidence of the recorders of the statements, I accepted their evidence that all the statements were voluntary statements and were accurately recorded. I gave full weight to the statements which proved that the accused persons had reason to believe that Richard was engaged in criminal activities and they therefore had much misgivings about the collection of large sums of money from strangers in Singapore. Nonetheless, they carried out Richard’s instructions because they were rewarded to do so.

158    On the other hand, I found the accused persons to be untruthful and shifty when they testified in court. I did not believe their oral testimonies. I also had no difficulty rejecting their defence in respect of Richard’s supposed legitimate business which was not supported by any credible or objective evidence.

159    I found it most telling that the accused persons failed to call Richard, their boss, be as a defence witness to support their defence. This Richard would no doubt be a very material witness because the core of the defence’s case was that Richard operated a legitimate money-changing business and the accused persons were merely his employees who had innocently carried out his instructions. The defence did not offer any credible reason for not calling this person to prove the accused persons’ claims. I was compelled to and I did draw an advance inference against the accused persons for such failure.

160    In respect of the MOA charge, I found that the accused persons were not able to satisfactorily explain the source of the cash that were seized from them. It was only their bald assertion that the cash was collected from licensed money-changers in the course of their employment. They could not even explain what they were doing in Singapore. I also found that their explanations were materially inconsistent. Therefore, I found that the accused persons have failed to account satisfactorily as to how they came by the said cash.

161    In conclusion, I found that both charges against the accused persons have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and they are convicted of the said charges.

## Sentence

162    Having convicted both accused persons of their respective two charges, I then considered the appropriate sentence to be imposed on them, having regard to the sentencing submission from the prosecution[^75] and the mitigation plea by the defence[^76].

### Charges and Prescribed Punishment

163    The accused persons were convicted on one count under s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA for collecting a sum of $369,900 which represented the criminal proceeds of the criminal conduct of Richard for whom they worked, thereby facilitating the retention by Richard of such benefits. The prescribed punishment under s 44(5) of the CDSA for the said offence is a fine not exceeding $500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or a combination of both punishments.

164    The accused persons were also convicted of another charge under s 35(1) of the MOA in respect of a sum of $597,450 which was suspected to be fraudulently obtained and for which they were unable to give a satisfactory account. The prescribed punishment for this offence is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or a combination of both punishments.

165    I agreed with the sentences proposed by the prosecution and sentenced the accused persons as follows:

### Sentencing Consideration for Money-Laundering

166    The prevalence of a particular type of offence is a relevant and aggravating sentencing factor to be given due and sufficient weight by the sentencing court. In this regard, it was reported in the media that the number of cases in the top 10 categories of scam offences (which included cases of impersonations of government officials from China) shot up by 140% to more than 7000 cases in the first half of this year as compared to the same period last year.[^77] The common thread which runs through all these categories of scams is that the victims would be tricked into revealing their credit card, bank account or password details and cheated of their money. The total amount of money that was cheated during this period as a result of such scams was a staggering $82 million which more than doubled the amount cheated the previous year.

167    I agreed with the general observations made by the prosecution in respect of police impersonation scam offences. These observations would hold true for all types and manner of impersonation scam offences which, as may be seen from media reports, are prevalent and exponentially increasing over the last two years.

168    Thus, it was submitted by the prosecution, which I agreed, that police impersonation scams are particularly difficult to investigate. The obvious reason is that such scams are invariably carried out by transnational syndicates with criminal members operating from abroad, posing as foreign police officers (as in the present case) in order to deceive and pressure the victims in Singapore into transferring money to various layers of intermediaries. These intermediaries are usually runners or money mules who may themselves be victims of impersonation scams and therefore have little or no knowledge of the real culprits within the syndicate. The runners are instructed to collect the money, either directly from the victims of cheating offences, or from other mules. As soon as the money is transferred to the grasp of the upper echelons of the syndicate, the money trail goes cold and becomes untraceable.

169    The victims of the impersonation scams receive phone calls from the impostors who identify themselves using false identification as police officers or customs officers. They deceive, pressure and even threaten the victims into revealing their personal and financial details and also to transfer money from their accounts or receive money into their accounts. The criminals prey on the unsuspecting and often elderly victims into believing that they had run afoul of the law and they then take advantage of the fear, anxiety and hence vulnerability of the victims to pressure them into parting with their money or in facilitating the money-laundering process. The entire set-up and operation involve much co-ordination between various conspirators working in different countries. There is much scheming and coordination to carry out such scams.

170    The successful operation of the entire scheme is very much dependent on the runner and intermediaries to carry out the bosses’ instructions to collect and transfer the monies. They make up the integral conduit system which funnels and feeds the proceeds of the illegal activities of the criminal syndicate to the crime bosses in the higher echelons of the syndicate. Without this conduit system, the entire scheme would not work. In this regard, Chow was an important part of the conduit system in that he, together with Poon, was planted in Singapore as the end-point in Singapore of the various tributaries of the flow of money, before the money is transferred across the border on the instructions of Richard.

171    Therefore, I fully agreed with the prosecution’s submission that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle in order to deter would-be offenders so as to cripple such syndicates.

### A. Sentences for Chow

#### Applicable sentencing framework

172    In _Ang Jeanette_ which was discussed above, the High Court observed that given Singapore’s status as an important financial centre for private banking and wealth management both globally and within Asia-Pacific, we have to protect the integrity of our financial processes and systems. Consequently, there is strong public interest to deter money-laundering activities by adequately punishing offenders who make use of our financial processes and systems to launder criminal proceeds. In other words, a crystal-clear signal must be sent to such offenders, including those who facilitate such offenders, that they will be firmly dealt with. With the sharp rise in online and impersonation scam cases as highlighted above resulting in millions of dollars being transferred from the bank accounts of victims and funnelled through layers of intermediaries or runners (“money-mules”), there is now, more than ever, an increased imperative to punish and deter the transfer of criminal proceeds which facilitates such scam offences.

173    In respect of punishing money-mules, a five-step sentencing framework was drawn up by the High Court in _Huang Ying-Chun v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 269</span> (“_Huang Ying-Chun_”). Counsel also adverted to the said sentencing framework (“HYC Framework”) in his mitigation. However, I did not agree with his application of the HYC Framework to the circumstances of this case. For ease of reference, the HYC Framework comprise the following steps[^78]:

> (a)     Identify the levels of harm and culpability;

> (b)     Identify the applicable indicative sentencing range;

> (c)     Identify the appropriate starting point within the range;

> (d)     Adjust the starting point to take into account the offender-specific factors; and

#### CDSA charge

176    I agreed with the application of the above framework as submitted by the prosecution against Chow as follows. As I have stated earlier, I did not subscribe to counsel’s application of the HYC Framework to the circumstances of Chow and as such, I rejected his proposal for only a fine to be imposed in respect of the CDSA charge. On the contrary, I found that the custodial threshold was certain crossed if the HYC Framework was correctly applied to the facts of the present case and the circumstances of the accused.

177    Chow was a runner for ‘Richard’ and had, together with Poon, collected a sum of at least $369,900. As a starting point, the HYC Framework is applicable to persons such as Chow who collect cash in Singapore and dissipate the money thereafter.[^79]

#### (1)   Step 1: Level of harm and culpability

178    In comparison to _Huang Ying-Chun_ where the level of harm was assessed to be severe for a laundered sum of about $950,000, I therefore agreed with prosecution’s submission that the level of harm in respect of the present CDSA charge is “moderate” and that Chow’s culpability, as a runner for Richard is at least “medium”. In other words, he would fall within the moderate harm – medium culpability sentencing band within the framework.

179    I accepted the reasons canvassed by the prosecution pegging the harm level as moderate as follows:

> (a)     The total sum laundered by Chow is less than the amount in _Huang Ying-Chun_;

> (b)     The presence of the following other offence-specific factors:

>> (i)       An organised syndicate was involved;

>> (ii)       The syndicate was transnational involving players in China and Malaysia at the very least;

>> (iii)       The underlying predicate offence of cheating was serious; and

>> (iv)       The nature of police impersonation scams caused reputational harm to law enforcement agencies in particular and public administration in general.

180    Likewise, I agreed that the justification to peg Chow’s culpability to be at least medium was as follows:

> (a)     There was much planning and premeditation in that the accused persons had leased an office space which was formerly a foreign exchange business, to conduct their money-laundering activities; the instructions and communications via group messaging; and the calculated system of identification using a dollar note;

> (b)     The syndicate was sophisticated in that it employed multiple layers of runners and mules in order to avoid detection and to mask the true identities of the criminals higher up the criminal organisation and chain;

> (c)     The duration of the laundering activities from 1 November 2017 to June 2018;

> (d)     Chow’s role went beyond a mere runner in that he rented a physical shop space and also registered a company in Singapore in order to open a corporate bank account to launder money through telegraphic transfers (“expanded role”);

> (e)     He entered and stayed in Singapore for the sole purpose of committing the offence;

> (f)     The prosecution accepted that:

>> (i)       There was no added element of abuse of trust, apart from the underlying offences;

>> (ii)       The accused did not have actual knowledge but only reasons to believe; and

>> (iii)       He was paid a monthly salary of $2,200 for his role which was not significant.

#### (2)   Step 2: Indicative sentencing range

181    On the basis of the analysis that this was a case of moderate harm and medium culpability, the indicative sentencing range within the HYC Framework would be _30 to 60 months’ imprisonment_.

#### (3)   Step 3: Starting point within the indicative range

182    Given Chow’s expanded role and that he was not, as prosecution would put it, a mere foot soldier, and also that he had reasonable grounds to believe that he was complicit in money-laundering activities, I agreed with prosecution’s submission that the starting point of his sentence should be in the middle of the indicating sentencing range i.e. 45 months’ imprisonment.

#### (4)   Step 4: Adjustments for offender-specific factors

183    I was of the view that there were no applicable offender-specific factors in respect of Chow. In particular, I considered that he contested the charge and would forfeit any sentencing discount which he might have been entitled. In _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Taufiq bin Djumadi_ (MA 9258 of 2016) at \[4\], the accused’s original sentence of a fine was set aside on appeal and substituted with a jail sentence. In his oral judgment at \[4\], See J considered, amongst other factors, that the accused in that case had claimed trial to his charge and did not show any sign of remorse. Therefore, the fact that an accused was unremorseful and has decided to claim trial to his charge is a relevant consideration (though not amounting to an aggravating factor) in deciding on the appropriate sentence. In the present case, the accused has also appealed against his conviction, further demonstrating his lack of remorse by continuing to deny his guilt and not taking responsibility for his criminal acts.

#### (5)   Step 5: Adjustment to take into account the totality principle

184    I was of the further view that no adjustments to the indicative sentence for the CDSA charge was required. As elaborated below, I also considered the totality principle when applied to the sentences of both charges.

185    I considered that the indicative sentence for the CDSA charge was, by parity, consistent with the sentence imposed on the intermediary, Wai Chung, who had pleaded guilty to his single charge under s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA. Wai Chung was also a Malaysian national who was 18 years old. He was recruited by the syndicate to collect $392,600 between 30 May 2018 – 1 June 2018 which was derived from police impersonation scams. Wai Chung then passed the money onwards to the present accused persons including Chow. His _mens rea_, as stated in the statement of facts, was not any higher than that of Chow i.e. less than actual knowledge. For his role, which was less involved than the present accused persons, Wai Chung was sentenced to 40 months’ imprisonment. Even if Wai Chung’s role is to be equated with Chow’s role (which it is not) and everything else being equal, Chow’s sentence would, as a matter of mathematical calculation, be 60 months’ imprisonment on the reasonable assumption that Wai Chung received a one third sentencing discount for his plea of guilt. In truth, Wai Chung probably received a less than one third discount because of a late plea of guilt on the first day of Wai Chung’s trial. Notwithstanding the late plea, it was nonetheless a plea of guilt showing remorse and would have merited a sentencing discount.

186    I further considered that the indicative sentence for the CDSA charge for Chow was also consistent with the comparable sentencing precedents presented by the prosecution. These were post-_Huang Ying-Chun_ cases where the offenders pleaded guilty to their respective charges under s 44 of the CDSA. As such, the sentences imposed in these precedents would have been discounted sentences on account of the offenders’ guilty pleas. The precedents indicate that for laundered sums between $74,000 to $1.76 million, lengthy custodial sentences were imposed which ranged between 30 to 65 months’ imprisonment.[^80] I noted that the defence did not submit any precedents of their own.

#### MOA charge

187    The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 35(1) of the MOA is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both punishments.

188    I considered the sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution in respect of offences under s 35(1) of the MOA for first-time offenders who pleaded guilty. Repeat offenders would have been liable to a higher prescribed punishment under s 35(5) of the MOA. The defence did not tender any precedents of their own. Generally, the precedents show that even where the value of the property found in the offender’s possession is relatively low (i.e. up to $8,000) the courts have imposed custodial sentences of between 5 – 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

189    In the present case, the value of property found on the accused persons was significantly higher than in the precedent cases, being cash amounting to $597,450. Additionally, Chow showed no remorse by contesting his charge unlike the offenders in the precedent cases who had pleaded guilty in demonstration of their contrition. Chow’s sentence ought therefore to be much higher. I was of the view that an imprisonment sentence of 8 months was condign in respect of the MOA charge.

#### Consecutive sentences for both charges

190    In deciding whether to run both sentences (for the CDSA and MOA charges) concurrently or consecutively, I applied the principles and framework set out by Menon CJ in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 34</span> (“_Shouffee_”). In summary, I was guided by the following key principles enunciated in _Shouffee_:

> (a)     The _one-transaction rule_ that sentences for offences which form part of a single transaction ought not to be ordered to run consecutively, especially if the various offences involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. However, this is not a rigid rule and regard must be made in a common-sensical way to factors such as proximity in time, proximity of purpose, proximity of location of the offences, continuity of design and unity of protected interests; and

> (b)     The _totality principle_ which is essentially a manifestation of the over-arching requirement of proportionality that runs through the gamut of sentencing decisions. The totality principle comprises two limbs:

>> (i)       Whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed; and

>> (ii)       Whether the overall sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospect.

191    I considered whether the one-transaction rule ought to benefit Chow given his circumstances and the court’s findings. Notwithstanding counsel’s argument that there was proximity in time in respect of the CDSA and MOA charges, in my judgement, the more important consideration was that both offences involved invasions of distinct and different legally protected interests. Thus, the MOA charge largely protects the personal property interests of the individual victims who have fallen prey to the police impersonation scams whereas the CDSA charge largely protects the interests of Singapore’s reputation as a global financial centre and the integrity of our banking systems.

192    The prosecution also rightly pointed out that the sum of money in respect of the MOA charge ($597,450) was higher than that in the CDSA charge ($369,990). The inference was that the MOA charge encompassed more victims whose personal property interests have been violated, as compared to the CDSA charge. In other words, even if both charges protect the personal property interests of victims, it was apparent that the interests protected by the MOA charge was far larger.

193    I therefore reasoned that the one-transaction rule did not apply and that the sentences in respect of both charges ought to be ordered to run consecutively. In any event, even if the one-transaction rule would otherwise have applied, I agreed with the prosecution that the need for a deterrent (and therefore consecutive) sentence was paramount and commensurate with the circumstances of the case given the following factors:

> (a)     The gravity of the offences which was also reflected by the large sums of money involved;

> (b)     The culpability of the accused given his expanded role coupled with his _mens rea_ of having reasons to believe that he was facilitating the laundering of proceeds of illegal activities;

> (c)     The strong public interest to protect multiple victims from falling prey to increasing incidences of scams;

> (d)     The strong public interest to deter money-laundering activities which render investigations into such cases difficult; and

> (e)     The harm caused to Singapore’s reputation as a global financial hub.

194    I therefore had no doubt that a consecutive sentence of 53 months’ imprisonment was entirely appropriate and justified.

195    In my judgment, the aggregate sentence of 53 months’ imprisonment did not breach the totality principle for the following reasons. First, I considered that the aggregate sentence was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. With reference to the HYC Framework, the indicative sentencing range for the ‘moderate harm-medium culpability’ category of cases is between 30 – 60 months’ imprisonment. Therefore, Chow’s global sentence of 53 months’ imprisonment would fall within this range. Secondly, I was also satisfied that the global sentence of 53 months’ imprisonment was by no means a crushing sentence on Chow having regard to his overall culpability and his future prospect. As pointed out by the prosecution, he is 35 years old and would likely be released from prison when he is about 39 years old after remission of sentence for good behaviour. He would still be young enough to start a career and contribute meaningfully to society, if he is so inclined.

#### Conclusion - Chow

196    For the above reasons, I sentenced Chow to a cumulative and consecutive sentence of 53 months’ imprisonment. I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence was neither crushing nor disproportionate to the accused’s overall culpability and the circumstances of the case.

### B. Sentence for Poon

#### Probation not appropriate

197    Poon was 18 years old at the time of the offence but turned 20 years old this year. In light of his relatively youthful age, counsel submitted that he ought to be considered for a probation order. I was unable to agree for the following reasons.

198    As summarised by the prosecution, the approach to sentencing youthful offenders is set out by the High Court in _PP v Mohammad Al-Ansari Bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> (“_Al-Ansari_”). Essentially, it is a two-step balancing exercise between the somewhat competing sentencing aims of rehabilitation and deterrence. The two-step consideration is as follows:

> (a)     The sentencing court must first consider if the sentencing aim of rehabilitation remains a dominant consideration. The general operating principle is that rehabilitation is a relevant and dominant consideration when sentencing young offenders but that consideration may be displaced or attenuated in appropriate circumstances e.g. if the offence is particularly heinous or if the offender has a long history of offending and there is little or no prospect of reform; and

> (b)     Even if rehabilitation remains a dominant consideration, the sentencing court must next decide how to give effect to this consideration.

199    In the present case, having regard to the first stage of the _Al-Ansari_ framework, I had to determine if there was scope for rehabilitation to feature as a sentencing consideration. In light of the accused’s relatively young age and the fact that I was also prepared to sentence him as a first offender, even though I would not know if he has any criminal record in Malaysia, I considered that rehabilitation remains a relevant and dominant consideration. That usually presents two sentencing options to give effect to this sentencing aim i.e. probation or reformative training (“RT”). As pointed out by the prosecution, the option of probation has a predominant emphasis on rehabilitation whereas the option of RT has a greater focus on deterrence.

200    In applying the second stage of _Al-Ansari_ framework, I considered the seriousness of the offence in question. There is no denying that the offence as spelt out in the CDSA charge is a serious offence, not least because the substantial prescribed maximum fine and imprisonment term. As I have noted above, offences of money-laundering harm the reputation and integrity of our financial systems. Therefore, it is imperative to deter and stamp out money-laundering offences by imposing sufficiently deterrent sentences.

201    I also considered the other aggravating circumstances of the present case which included the multiple victims involved, the large sums of money laundered and the increasing prevalence of the predicate scam offences. I had earlier highlighted the escalating prevalence of scam offences in recent years and the fact that money-launderers and money-mules serve an integral function in facilitating such scams. I further considered the culpability of the offender. He played an involved role as evidenced by the fact that he was remunerated monthly to assist Richard for about half a year until he was arrested in June 2018. His role was an active and expanded one (similar to Chow’s) in that he collected and transferred substantial sums of money and carried out his money-laundering activities using a sham and shell shop which used to function as a foreign-exchange business.

202    Therefore, notwithstanding that the accused was a permanent resident with some familial support, I was of the view that the option of RT was the more appropriate sentencing option in achieving the optimum balance between rehabilitation and the strong need for general and specific deterrence for his offences. I also did not find any special or specific reason to prefer the sentencing aim of rehabilitation over that of deterrence.

203    I called for an RT report and one was prepared by the Prisons authorities.[^81] The report found him to be both medically and psychologically suitable for the RT regime. The report recommended that, if ordered to undergo RT, the accused be placed on level one intensity of rehabilitation i.e. a duration of 6 months. I noted from the interviews conducted by the correctional rehabilitation specialist with Poon, that he continued to deny any suspicion that Richard was involved in illegal activities, notwithstanding his admission of the same to the police. I found that he was still unremorseful and had very little insight into his criminal acts. Therefore, I was of the view that a stint in a strict and closed environment in the RT Centre was the more appropriate sentencing option as compared to probation.

204    Accordingly, I ordered Poon to undergo RT for a period of six months. I was in agreement with prosecution’s submission that rehabilitation in a closed and structured environment of the RT centre would be more appropriate for Poon. As may been seen from the evidence, he lacked familial supervision which ultimately led to his commission of the offences. He came to Singapore to stay with his parents who were working here. Even though he was staying with his parents, he was allowed to work for Richard for an extended period to launder money on the instructions passed down by Richard. His parents were oblivious to what Poon was actually doing, thinking that he was merely working for a relative. Poon was also motivated by monetary greed. I agreed with prosecution’s point that, given the difficulty in detecting money-laundering offences, if Poon was to be placed on probation with relative freedom of movement and communication (unlike under an RT regime), there would be every chance that he may be tempted to re-offend.

205    Finally, by way of parity, I noted that Wai Chung was also a Malaysian and was 18 years old at the time of the offence and when he was sentenced on 18 January 2019.[^82] He was therefore even younger than Poon at the time of his sentence. However, despite having pleaded guilty to his charge and having a lesser role than Poon in the entire money-laundering scheme, Wai Chung was sentenced to imprisonment for 40 months. Therefore, a sentence of RT for Poon cannot be considered manifestly excessive.

#### Conclusion - Poon

206    In conclusion, I was satisfied that a sentence of RT struck the right balance between the strong need for deterrence, given the gravity of the of the offence and the Poon’s criminality, and the aim of rehabilitation which remained a relevant consideration given his age.
