### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

## Introduction

The accused person, male, aged 35 years, a PRC national, pleaded guilty to 4 charges under the Customs Act, Chapter 70. All the offences which resulted in the 4 charges were committed on the 22 of August 2019. The particulars of these charges are as follows:

> i.     DAC-924096/097-2019 (C1 and C2)- At about 7.25 pm at the carpark of Block 720 Bedok Resevoir Road together with one Du Changyu(Du) the accused was concerned in the delivery of 37.608 kilogrammes (kg) of cigarettes on which excise duty of $19,061.28 and Goods and Services Tax (GST) of $1,405.54 was unpaid and he had therefore committed 2 offences under section128F of the Customs Act (CA) and punishable under section 128L(4) of the same Act;

> ii.     DAC-924098/099-2019 (C3-C4)- At about 10.42 pm at unit 9145 of Storhub Tampines the accused did store uncustomed goods namely 109 cartons of duty unpaid cigarettes weighing 32.178 kg on which excise duty of $15,030.40 and GST of $1,108.31 had not been paid and he had therefore committed 2 offences under section 128F of the CA and punishable under section 128L(4) of the same Act.

2       I sentenced the accused to serve a global sentence of 8 months imprisonment (the breakdown of the individual sentences are as listed in paragraph 11). Being dissatisfied, he is now appealing against this sentence.

## The Statement of Facts(SOF)

3       The SOF which the accused admitted without qualification is reproduced below:

> The accused person is Chen Qinghui, FIN No.: (XXX) Male, 35 years old, D.O.B.: 20/03/1984, PRC National (“B1”).

> 2.    The co-accused person is B2: Du Changyu, FIN No.: (XXX) , Male, 37 years old, D.O.B.: 23/07/1982, PRC National.

> **_Facts pertaining to the 1st and 2nd charges (DAC-924096-97/2019)_**

> 3.    On 22 August 2019, from 07.21pm onwards, Customs officers (the “Officers”) were conducting observations on illicit activities involving duty unpaid cigarettes at the carpark of Block 720 Bedok Reservoir Road, Singapore. At about 07.25pm, at the said location, the officers sighted B1 alighting from a Singapore-registered van bearing plate number GBE1962S (“V1”) and walking towards the void deck of the said Block, carrying a bulky red plastic bag, and looking around the vicinity suspiciously. Suspecting that B1 was dealing with duty unpaid cigarettes, the officers declared office and conducted a check on B1 and V1. Upon checking, the officers found 9 cartons x 200 sticks and 10 packets x 20 sticks of League Classic duty unpaid cigarettes in the red plastic bag that B1 was carrying. B1 admitted knowledge and ownership of the cigarettes found.

> 4.    Upon checking on V1, the officers found 159 cartons x 200 sticks and 542 packets x 20 sticks of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes packed within assorted canvas bags and plastic bags inside V1. B2 was found inside V1 arranging the cigarettes into the canvas and plastic bags. B1 and B2 admitted knowledge of the duty unpaid cigarettes found inside V1.

> **_Facts pertaining to the 3rd and 4th charges (DAC-924098-99/2019)_**

> 5.    Upon questioning by the officers, the officers were led to Unit 9145 of Storhub Tampines, Singapore (the “Unit”), where B1 used his fingerprint to unlock the fingerprint lock to the Unit. Using the password given by B1, the officers then unlocked the number padlock to the Unit. Upon checking, the officers found 109 cartons x 200 sticks and 670 packets x 20 sticks of assorted brands of duty unpaid cigarettes packed within several pink canvas bags inside the Unit. B1 admitted knowledge of the duty unpaid cigarettes found inside the Unit. B1 was placed under arrest and all the cigarettes found, plastic bags and canvas bags, a number padlock, V1, 1 iPhone and cash $3,000.00 were seized for investigations.

> **_Investigation findings_**

> 6.    Investigations revealed that B1 was engaged by one “Xiao Li” to deliver duty unpaid cigarettes to Xiao Li’s customers since early July 2019. B1 would drive V1, which is B1’s company van, to designated locations as instructed by Xiao Li through WeChat for Xiao Li’s workers to load the duty unpaid cigarettes into V1. Thereafter, B1 would pack the cigarettes and deliver to Xiao Li’s customers as well as collect the sales proceeds from the customers, before transferring the sales proceeds to Xiao Li. B1 was promised to be paid $200 to $300 a day for the cigarette delivery job.

> 7.    Further investigations revealed that sometime in mid-August 2019, B1 was instructed by Xiao Li to rent the Unit to store duty unpaid cigarettes for delivery. B1 also engaged B2 to help him pack and deliver duty unpaid cigarettes to Xiao Li’s customers at $100 a day. On the date of offence, B1 and B2 were detained by the officers while they were on the way to deliver duty unpaid cigarettes to one of Xiao Li’s customers.

> 8.    Further investigations revealed that B1 had used his mobile phone (an iPhone) to take instructions from Xiao Li on delivery of duty unpaid cigarettes as well as to contact Xiao Li’s customers to deliver duty unpaid cigarettes to them. The said iPhone was seized as case exhibit.

> 9.    Cash of SGD 3,000.00 was also found in B1’s possession during his arrest. Investigations revealed that the said cash were proceed from the sale of duty unpaid cigarettes which B1 had collected from Xiao Li’s customers. The said cash was seized as a case exhibit.

> 10.    B1 and B2 knew that the excise duty and the Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’) leviable on the seized cigarettes were unpaid at the material time the offence was committed.

> 11.    The excise duty leviable on the seized cigarettes weighing a total of 37.608 kilogrammes in the 1st charge is $19,061.28. The GST leviable on the same cigarettes in the 2nd charge, valued at $20,079.07, is $1,405.54.

> 12.    The excise duty leviable on the seized cigarettes weighing a total of 32.178 kilogrammes in the 3rd charge is $15,030.40. The GST leviable on the same cigarettes in the 4th charge, valued at $15,832.96, is $1,108.31.

> 13.    B1 and B2, in furtherance of the common intention of them both, were thus concerned in delivery of uncustomed goods (cigarettes).

## The Sentence

4       The accused has been convicted of 4 counts under the Customs Act for offences committed on the 22 of August 2109. The penalty in respect of the first charge in DAC-924096-2019 involving 37.608 kg of cigarettes on which duty was not paid would be a fine in the range of $285,919.20 to $381,225.60 or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or to both. Where the GST is concerned for this amount (DAC-924097-2019), the penalty is a fine in the range of $21,083.10 to $28,110.80 or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years. For the third charge in DAC-924098-2019 involving 32.178 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes the penalty is a fine in the range of $225,456 to $300,608 or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or to both. Where the GST is concerned for this amount (DAC-924099-2019), the penalty is a fine in the range of $16,624.65 to $22,166.20 or to imprisonment not exceeding 3 years.

5       In their written address on sentence, the prosecution, relying on the case of _Public Prosecutor v Pang Shuo <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 82</span>(Pang Shuo)_ submitted for a sentence of 4 months imprisonment for each duty charge and 1 month imprisonment for each GST charge. This, they said, was in line with the table of sentencing precedents where it appeared that for between 29 to 40 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes the fine imposed was 4 months imprisonment for the duty charge and 1 month imprisonment for the GST charge. In his oral plea in mitigation, the accused who is a first offender pleaded for leniency. He said he was remorseful, had a housing loan to service and 2 children to support.

6       It is well established that the sentencing ranges for offences involving duty unpaid cigarettes were first outlined by the Chief Justice at \[46\] of _Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span>._ In this case, the learned Chief Justice at \[27\] and \[35\] identified the quantity of cigarettes as the _key indicator_ of the seriousness of the crime and was the _“primary factor”_ or _“key parameter”_ influencing the length of sentence for a CA offence. The Chief Justice then proceeded to consider the relevant factors for such offences and at \[46\], set out a graduated scheme that cross references the quantity of tobacco with the duration of the imprisonment term that can be expected to be imposed as a starting point. This was as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="49.46%"> <col width="50.54%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Quantity of Tobacco Products (kg)</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range (months)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2 – 50</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3-6</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">51-100</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6-12</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">101 – 200</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">12 – 18</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">201 – 300</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">18 – 24</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">301 – 400</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24 – 30</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">More than 400</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30 – 36</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

7       In the later case of _Pang Shuo_, the High Court, adopting _Yap Ah Lai’s_ approach held that the benchmark sentences as set out in that case for importation are applicable to the sentencing of other offences such as delivery, loading, unloading and storing of duty unpaid tobacco products. The High Court further refined the guidelines for these offences in the form of a graph (Graph 3 at \[49\]). The primary factor to be considered for sentencing remained the quantity of the cigarettes. Based on this graph, the sentence for the accused in respect of the first charge which involving 37.608 kg for the first charge and 32.178 kg for the third charge would be in the first tier of the table, that is for 2-50 kg the range is between 3-6 months imprisonment. A submission of a sentence of 4 months was indeed fair and appropriate and consistent with the table of precedents tendered by the prosecution which showed that for between 29 to 40 kg of duty unpaid cigarettes, the sentence imposed was 4 months imprisonment for the duty charge and 1 month imprisonment for the GST charge.

8       Returning to the facts of this case, the accused has been convicted of 1 count of being concerned in the delivery of 37.68 kg of cigarettes at about 7.25 pm together with Du, B2. Some 3 hours later at about 10.42 pm, he was found to have stored 32.178 kg of cigarettes in another location. Du was not involved in the second offence. The prosecution therefore sought for the terms of imprisonment for each duty unpaid charge to run consecutively. I accepted their submission. To make both terms run concurrently would ignore the fact that in total for both charges, the quantity for both charges is 69.78 kg of cigarettes. This quantity brings it squarely within the second tier of the table and the sentence would be 6-12 months.

9       The resulting sentence of 8 months imprisonment if both are ordered to run consecutively is well within the middle of the range and cannot be described as being excessive. The accused is certainly more culpable than Du as firstly he has committed more offences than the latter and appeared to have played a more active role as he was the one who engaged Du to take part in the enterprise. Further, he had also provided his company’s vehicle to load and deliver the contraband to the customers of the head of this criminal enterprise, the unknown Xiao Li. Nevertheless, I would view him as a mere paid worker who did not have a share of the profit of the illegal enterprise.

10     Whilst I am mindful of the fact that, despite the presence of sentencing tariffs or benchmarks, the court should be sensitive to the particular facts and circumstances of each case that are of first importance when determining the appropriate sentence, there was nothing exceptional in the present case that would warrant a departure from the sentencing range set out in _Yap Ah Lai_. I have also taken into account the fact that the accused did plead guilty at the first available opportunity which is a significant mitigating factor.

11     Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to:

12     I ordered the two sentences of 4 months imprisonment to run consecutively, yielding a global of 8 months imprisonment which was backdated to the 24-August-2019 as he had been in remand since this date. For completeness, I should mention that Du received a similar sentence of 4 months imprisonment for the common charges he had with this accused.

13     The accused is presently serving his sentence.
