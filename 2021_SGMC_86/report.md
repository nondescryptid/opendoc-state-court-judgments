### District Judge Lim Mei Yee Elaine:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff brought the present claim on six unpaid invoices totalling S$53,902.59 in respect of equipment it had supplied to the defendant (the “Invoices”). The defendant counterclaimed for the sum of S$1,169,244 on the ground that the customised food processing automatic system supplied by the plaintiff to the defendant did not conform to the agreed specifications and was defective and non-functional.

2       After considering the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I allow the plaintiff’s claim in part in the sum of S$2,726.36 and the defendant’s counterclaim in part in the sum of S$1,156,147.20. These are the reasons for my decision.

## Undisputed facts

3       The parties are local companies. The defendant is in the business of manufacturing and selling popiah and spring roll sheets, filings and sauces.

4       Between 10 July 2018 and 21 January 2019, the plaintiff issued the Invoices to the defendant for the supply of various equipment:[^1]

5       Despite the plaintiff’s numerous demands for payment, the defendant has not paid any of the Invoices. The defendant’s case, in gist, is that there was no agreement between the parties for the supply of the equipment mentioned in INV18176, INV18214 and INV19009, and that the equipment delivered pursuant to the rest of the Invoices did not conform to the agreed specifications.

6       In or around June or July 2018, the parties entered into an agreement under which the plaintiff would develop and customise for the defendant a food processing automatic system for the processing of turnips (the “Food Processor”) for the price of S$976,054.00 (the “Turnip System Agreement”). The following documents form part of the Turnip System Agreement:[^8]

> (a)     the proposal for the project titled “Development and customizing for Food Processing Automatic System for Turnip and Sauce”, which the plaintiff’s director and shareholder, Mr Loo Yeow Teck (“Mr Loo”), handed to the defendant’s director, Ms Li Li Hong (“Ms Li”) in or around June or July 2018 (the “Proposal”);[^9]

> (b)     the Equipment List for Blanching and Cooking (the “Equipment List”);[^10]

> (c)     the defendant’s quotation to the plaintiff for the Food Processor dated 21 July 2018 (the “Quotation”);[^11] and

> (d)     the document titled “Clients’ Requirement”,[^12] which set out the agreed specifications for the retort system (the “Retort Specifications”).[^13]

7       The parties agreed that payment for the Food Processor would be made in three instalments of 40%, 40% and 20% of the price. The first instalment was to be paid upon the defendant entering into the Turnip System Agreement. The second instalment was to be paid when all the components of the Food Processor were delivered to the defendant. The final instalment was to be paid after installation and commissioning of the Food Processor had been completed.[^14]

8       While the defendant has made full payment for the Food Processor, it claims that the Food Processor was defective and non-functional.

## Issues to be determined

9       The parties have helpfully agreed that the following are the issues to be determined:[^15]

> In relation to the plaintiff’s claim

> (a)     Issue 1: whether there was an agreement between the parties for the plaintiff to supply and for the defendant to purchase the Nitrogen Equipment from the plaintiff;

> (b)     Issue 2: whether the plaintiff manufactured and supplied the Showroom Equipment in accordance with the defendant’s specifications as agreed to by the plaintiff;

> (c)     Issue 3: whether there was an agreement between the parties for the defendant to rent the Forklift, and if so, for what purpose;

> (d)     Issue 4: whether the Kitchen Equipment installed by the plaintiff was in accordance with the defendant’s specifications as agreed to by the plaintiff;

> (e)     Issue 5: whether the Flour Machines supplied by the plaintiff were in accordance with the parties’ agreement; and

> (f)     Issue 6: whether there was an agreement between the parties for the plaintiff to install the compressed air pipeline for the sum of S$3,200.00.

> In relation to the defendant’s counterclaim

> (g)     Issue 7: whether the Food Processor supplied by the plaintiff conformed to the specifications agreed by both parties or was non-functional and defective;

> (h)     Issue 8: whether the plaintiff provided adequate site support to the defendant such that the defendant’s employees would be able to operate the Food Processor;

> (i)     Issue 9: whether the Food Processor was of satisfactory quality.

> (j)     Issue 10: whether the Food Processor was reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal, in particular the Project Objectives and Project Impact;

> (k)     Issue 11: whether the defendant is entitled to a refund of S$976,054.00 paid for the Food Processor and damages of S$193,190.00.

10     For Issue 7, the agreed sub-issues to be determined are as follows:

> (a)     whether the peeling machine is able to peel the raw turnips completely, and whether it has capacity to process up to 300 kg of turnips as stated at page 6 of the Quotation;

> (b)     whether the specifications agreed by the parties placed any restrictions on the size of the turnips that could be processed;

> (c)     whether the Food Processor is fully automated;

> (d)     whether turnips would become stuck, or spill out, in the course of being processed;

> (e)     whether the production output has increased by 500%, as set out at page 3 of the Proposal;

> (f)     whether the quality of the turnips processed by the Food Processor has improved, as set out at page 3 of the Proposal;

> (g)     whether the retort system conforms to pages 1 and 2 of the Retort Specifications; and

> (h)     whether there was any handover list delivered to and signed by the defendant.

11     In addition to the above list of agreed issues, the following issue arises from the defendant’s written closing submissions. That is, whether the plaintiff’s claim on the Invoices fails due to deficiencies in its pleadings.[^16] This is a preliminary issue to be addressed before I consider Issues 1 to 6.

## The parties’ witnesses

12     A total of six witnesses testified at the trial of this Suit.

13     The plaintiff put forward three witnesses, all of whom were factual witnesses:

> (a)     Mr Loo, who was known to the defendant’s representatives as Paul;

> (b)     Ms Qiao Jiaojiao (“Ms Qiao”), an employee of Henan Union International Co. Ltd (“Henan International”), the company that manufactured the Food Processor;[^17] and

> (c)     Mr Xu Xiangwei (“Mr Xu”), an employee of Shandong Dingtaisheng Food Industry Equipment Co., Ltd (“DTS”).

14     The defendant’s witnesses were:

> (a)     Ms Li;

> (b)     Mr Aung Kyaw Pho (“Mr Aung”) who, at all material times, was and remains an employee of the defendant, and

> (c)     Mr Tan Teck Peng (“Mr Tan”), an expert witness who provided his opinion on whether the Food Processor was fully automated as well as the quality of the Food Processor. Mr Tan is the director and owner of Wing Teck Industry Pte. Ltd. (“Wing Teck”), which specialises in various material-handling and engineering systems.

## Burden of proof

15     Before analysing the merits of the claim and the counterclaim, it is apposite to address on whom the legal burden of proof lies for each issue.

16     For Issues 1, 3 and 6, the burden clearly falls on the plaintiff to prove that there were agreements between the parties for the supply of the equipment mentioned in INV18176, INV18214 and INV19009, since that is the foundation of its claim on these invoices.

17     For Issues 2, 4 and 5, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the equipment mentioned in INV18178, INV18226 and INV18277 conformed to the agreed specifications.

> (a)     Pursuant to section 27 of the Sales of Goods Act (Cap. 393, Rev. Ed. 1999) (“SOGA”), it is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods, and of the buyer to accept and pay for them, in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale. The seller’s duty to deliver is: (a) in a contract for the sale of specific goods, to deliver the particular goods contracted for, and (b) in a contract for the sale of unascertained goods, to deliver goods which answer the contract description: see _Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 11th Ed, 2020) (“_Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_”) at \[8-003\]. Thus, in either case, the goods must conform to the agreed specifications in order for the seller to have discharged his duty to deliver.

> (b)     Section 28 of the SOGA provides that unless otherwise agreed, delivery of the goods and payment of the price are concurrent conditions.

> (c)     As neither party pleaded, or adduced any evidence on, the contractually agreed time for payment for the equipment, section 28 applies such that payment was due when the equipment was delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant in accordance with the terms of the contract. This means that the plaintiff must prove that the equipment delivered conformed to the agreed specifications, in order to be entitled to payment.

18     Issues 7 to 11 arise from the defendant’s counterclaim. Accordingly, the defendant bears the burden of proving its case for each issue.

## The plaintiff’s claim

### Preliminary issue: Whether the plaintiff’s claim fails due to deficiencies in its pleadings

19     The defendant submits that even before one considers the evidence, the plaintiff’s claim fails completely because the plaintiff did not plead that there was an agreement for any of the Invoices, whether there was offer and acceptance, what was the consideration, and the terms of any such agreements.[^18]

20     It is trite that where a party’s claim is founded on an agreement, the pleading must state: (a) the date of the alleged agreement, (b) whether it was made orally or in writing, (c) if it was made orally, by whom it was made, (d) if it was made in writing, identifying the document, (e) the relevant terms of the agreement which are relied on, and (f) the consideration for the agreement: see _Singapore Civil Procedure 2020_ Vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, Singapore: 2020) at \[18/12/5\].

21     Nonetheless, the courts should not blindly descend into technicalities when assessing the adequacy of pleadings. As held by the Singapore Court of Appeal in _BOM v BOK and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 349</span> at \[40\]:

> “one must also be careful not to descend blindly into technicalities when assessing the adequacy of pleadings, and to _always bear in mind that their ultimate purpose is to define the scope of the issues arising for the court’s determination and to ensure that the parties are not taken by surprise and deprived of the opportunity to adduce the relevant evidence_: see_, eg. Sheagar_ at \[94\] and _Fu Loong Lithographer Pte Ltd v Mok Wing Chong_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 645</span> at \[61\]. It is for this reason that we observed in _OMG Holdings Ptd Ltd v Pos Ad Sdn Bhd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 231</span> that “_evidence given at trial can, where appropriate, overcome defects in the pleadings provided that the other party is not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced_” \[emphasis added\] (at \[18\])”

> \[emphasis added\]

22     In my view, any deficiencies in the plaintiff’s pleaded claim on the Invoices do not warrant the dismissal of the claim _in limine_ because the defendant was not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced by such deficiencies.

23     In relation to INV18176, INV18214 and INV19009, the plaintiff’s pleadings do set out the relevant terms of and consideration for the agreements: they describe the equipment supplied under these invoices and the prices of the equipment, and suggest that the consideration flowing from the plaintiff was the promise to deliver the equipment while the consideration flowing from the defendant was the promise to pay for the equipment supplied.[^19] What the plaintiff’s pleadings do not set out is the dates of the agreements, whether they were oral or in writing, and the persons who entered into any such oral agreements on behalf of the parties or the documents in which any such written agreements are contained.

24     However, I find that the failure to plead such matters did not take the defendant by surprise or cause any irreparable prejudice to the defendant. As can be seen from my analysis on Issues 1, 3 and 6 below, the defendant was able to respond to the plaintiff’s claim on these invoices. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement between the parties for the supply of the invoiced items, and it had adduced the relevant evidence in support of its position. The defendant also had ample opportunity to test the veracity of the plaintiff’s case on these invoices, as counsel for the defendant had cross examined Mr Loo on the same.

25     In relation to INV18178, INV18226, INV18277, the defendant does not dispute that there were agreements between the parties for the supply of the equipment listed in these invoices. The issue in dispute is whether the equipment supplied conformed to the specifications agreed between the parties. While the plaintiff did not plead any particulars of the agreed specifications, its pleadings and Mr Loo’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) did state that:

> (a)     the dimensions for the Showroom Equipment were provided by the defendant, and based on those dimensions, the plaintiff provided designs to the defendant which it had approved;[^20]

> (b)     the Kitchen Equipment was installed based on the kitchen dimensions provided by the defendant and upon the defendant’s confirmation;[^21] and

> (c)     the quotation and the specifications of the Flour Machines were provided by the plaintiff to the defendant, and the defendant confirmed the same.[^22]

26     The defendant therefore knew, in general terms, the case it had to meet in relation to these invoices. Moreover, it is evident from my analysis of Issues 2, 4 and 5 below that the defendant was able to respond to the plaintiff’s case, adduce the relevant evidence in support of its position, and test the veracity of the plaintiff’s case by cross examining Mr Loo.

27     I would add that it is telling that the defendant did not argue that the deficiencies in the plaintiff’s pleadings took it by surprise or caused it any irreparable prejudice. This underscores that no such surprise or prejudice was suffered by the defendant. For this reason, I do not agree that the plaintiff’s claim on the Invoices fails simply due to the deficiencies in its pleadings.

### Issue 1: Whether there was an agreement for the supply and purchase of the Nitrogen Equipment

28     The plaintiff’s case is that Ms Li had approached Mr Loo to order the Nitrogen Equipment on 10 July 2018, and the equipment was delivered to the defendant that same day. The defendant had used the equipment, which is still in its possession.[^23] In this regard, Mr Loo testified at trial that the defendant’s purpose for purchasing the Nitrogen Equipment was to test the effect of putting nitrogen into its packaging, and that the plaintiff had issued a quotation to the defendant for the Nitrogen Equipment.[^24]

29     In its closing submissions, the plaintiff argued that it had purchased the Nitrogen Equipment from WKS Industrial Gas Pte Ltd (“WKS”), and that it is incredulous for the defendant to suggest that the plaintiff would incur such costs without first having any agreement with the defendant for the supply and purchase of the equipment.[^25]

30     I find that the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proving the existence of an agreement between the parties for the supply and purchase of the Nitrogen Equipment. The plaintiff’s case that such an agreement exists is a bare assertion. The plaintiff has not disclosed the quotation which it had allegedly issued to the defendant for the Nitrogen Equipment. There is also no objective evidence before me that Ms Li had approached Mr Loo to order the Nitrogen Equipment, or that the defendant had used the equipment. Moreover, the plaintiff’s argument that it had purchased the Nitrogen Equipment from WKS to supply to the defendant is simply a submission from the bar. None of the plaintiff’s witnesses gave evidence to that effect.

31     I accept the defendant’s case that the plaintiff’s delivery of the Nitrogen Equipment to the defendant’s factory in June or July 2018 was simply an invitation to treat,[^26] and that no offer was made by the defendant to purchase the equipment.

32     It is Ms Li’s evidence in her AEIC that:[^27]

> (a)     during Mr Loo’s first visit to the defendant’s factory in early 2018, he had recommended that the defendant purchase the Nitrogen Equipment, to be used together with a liquid nitrogen freezer, to freeze and preserve its products. As Ms Li had not used such equipment before, Mr Loo offered to bring the equipment to the factory to show her how it worked so that she could decide whether it suited the defendant’s needs.

> (b)     When Mr Loo brought the equipment to the factory a few days later, it was only for nitrogen gas and not liquid nitrogen. Ms Li informed Mr Loo that the equipment was not suitable as the capacity was too small for the defendant’s large-scale manufacturing.

> (c)     Mr Loo then promised to take back the equipment at a later date when the plaintiff delivered the Food Processor to the defendant’s factory, as he would then have the appropriate machinery to transport the Nitrogen Equipment.

33     Ms Li’s evidence was not undermined during cross-examination.[^28] The plaintiff has not adduced any objective evidence which contradicts Ms Li’s evidence.

34     In my view, Mr Loo’s delivery of the Nitrogen Equipment to the defendant’s factory was not an offer by the plaintiff to sell the equipment to the defendant. An offer consists of “a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted”: see _Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 332</span> (“_Gay Choon Ing_”) at \[47\].[^29] Here, no definite promise was made by Mr Loo to be bound to sell the Nitrogen Equipment to the defendant on certain terms. Instead, Mr Loo had made “an attempt to initiate negotiations, to induce offers” – _ie_, an invitation to treat – in the hope that his demonstration of how the Nitrogen Equipment worked would induce an offer from the defendant to purchase the equipment: see _Gay Choon Ing_ at \[48\].

35     It is well settled that a response to an invitation to treat can never result in a concluded contract: see _Gay Choon Ing_ at \[48\]. The defendant eventually did not make any offer to purchase the Nitrogen Equipment. Thus, there was no agreement between the parties for the supply and purchase of the Nitrogen Equipment. For this reason, the plaintiff’s claim on INV18176 fails.

### Issue 2: Whether the plaintiff manufactured and supplied the Showroom Equipment in accordance with the agreed specifications

#### The agreed specifications of the Trolleys

36     The plaintiff’s case is that during their flight to China in July 2018 to visit factories which could manufacture the Food Processor (the “Visit to China”), Ms Li asked Mr Loo whether the plaintiff could supply the Showroom Equipment and provided Mr Loo with dimensions for the Trolleys. Mr Loo subsequently provided Ms Li with drawings of the Trolleys which were based on those dimensions, for her confirmation. He also issued a quotation for the Showroom Equipment to the defendant.[^30]

37     According to the plaintiff, it was only after Ms Li approved the drawings that the plaintiff had the Showroom Equipment manufactured in accordance with the approved dimensions, and invoiced the defendant for the same. When the Showroom Equipment was delivered to the defendant, it then realised that it had provided the wrong dimensions to the plaintiff which resulted in its inability to install the equipment in 7-11 and NTUC showrooms. Hence the fault lies with the defendant in providing the wrong dimensions to the plaintiff.[^31]

38     There is no objective evidence which supports the plaintiff’s case. The plaintiff did not disclose the drawings of the Trolleys which Mr Loo had allegedly provided to Ms Li, or any documentary evidence that Ms Li had approved such drawings. While Mr Loo claimed during cross-examination that his AEIC exhibited a photograph and a WhatsApp message which showed the time he sent the drawings to Ms Li,[^32] no such photograph or WhatsApp message could be found in his AEIC. There is also no evidence of any quotation issued by the plaintiff to the defendant for the Showroom Equipment.

39     By contrast, there is objective evidence which supports the defendant’s case that the parties had agreed that the NTUC Trolley would have the standard dimensions of trolleys which could be used in NTUC supermarkets to display products, and that the specifications of the 7-11 Trolley would follow the 7-11 Trolley Drawing (as defined in \[41(b)\] below).

40     It is Ms Li’s evidence in her AEIC that:[^33]

> (a)     during their flight to China, she showed Mr Loo mock up pictures of the Trolleys on her phone, which pictures she had earlier sent via WhatsApp to another potential supplier. She asked Mr Loo whether the plaintiff could supply such Trolleys to be used in supermarkets and convenience stores to showcase the defendant’s products. As Mr Loo verbally informed Ms Li that the plaintiff would be able to do so, she agreed that the defendant would purchase the Trolleys from the plaintiff;

> (b)     thereafter, Ms Li sent Mr Loo a drawing of the 7-11 Trolley with dimensions and measurements. Ms Li did not provide a drawing of the NTUC Trolley to Mr Loo because he had told her that he was familiar with the size requirements for trolleys used at NTUC supermarkets.

41     The defendant has disclosed the following documents which are consistent with Ms Li’s evidence:

> (a)     screenshots of WhatsApp messages Ms Li had sent to a potential supplier on 30 June 2018, in which she attached various photographs of trolleys for use in showrooms and asked the supplier whether he made such trolleys;[^34] and

> (b)     a drawing of a trolley with dimensions and measurements on Ms Li’s mobile phone (the “7-11 Trolley Drawing”).[^35]

42     In the premises, I find that the parties had agreed that:

> (a)     the specifications of the NTUC Trolley would be the same as the standard dimensions for trolleys which could be used in NTUC supermarkets to display products; and

> (b)     the specifications of the 7-11 Trolley would be that shown in the 7-11 Trolley Drawing. These specifications are set out in the table at \[44\] below.

#### The Trolleys did not meet the agreed specifications

43     It is Ms Li’s unchallenged evidence that when the defendant visited an NTUC supermarket with the NTUC Trolley, the defendant was denied entry as the trolley was too large.[^36]

44     It is also Ms Li’s unchallenged evidence that the 7-11 Trolley did not conform to the specifications shown in the 7-11 Trolley Drawing, such that the defendant was denied entry when it visited a 7-11 store with the trolley.[^37] I reproduce below the table in \[19\] of Ms Li’s AEIC which compares the two sets of specifications:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="29.36%"> <col width="33.74%"> <col width="36.9%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Specifications in the 7-11 Trolley Drawing</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Actual specifications of trolley supplied by the plaintiff <span class="FootnoteRef"><a href="#Ftn_38" id="Ftn_38_1"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Height of storage cabinet</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">90</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">78</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Width of storage cabinet</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">80</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">92</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Height of shelter above the storage cabinet</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">92</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">141</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Length of cabinet doors</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">130</p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">140</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Height of cabinet doors</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">60</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">67</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

45     Accordingly, I find that the Trolleys did not conform to the agreed specifications and the defendant could not use them for their intended purpose.

46     Given that the defendant was unable to use the Trolleys for their intended purpose, I find that the plaintiff had failed to provide substantially the whole of the benefit that the defendant expected to obtain from the parties’ contract for the supply and purchase of the Trolleys. This repudiatory breach entitled the defendant to terminate the contract: see _Sports Connection Pte Ltd v Deuter Sports GmbH_ \[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 896 (“_Sports Connection_”) at \[24\].[^39]

#### The defendant had rejected the Trolleys

47     The plaintiff submitted that even if the Trolleys did not conform to the agreed specifications, the defendant did not reject the Trolleys, but instead continued to use them. Moreover, the defendant did not raise any issues with INV 18178 within a reasonable time after the Trolleys were delivered and the invoice was issued. The defendant is thus deemed to have accepted the Trolleys pursuant to section 35(4) of the SOGA.[^40]

48     I am not persuaded by this submission. Following from my finding that the Trolleys did not conform to the agreed specifications and the defendant could not use them for their intended purpose, I accept Ms Li’s evidence that:[^41]

> (a)     after the defendant was denied entry into NTUC and 7-11 stores, she had verbally informed Mr Loo that the Trolleys did not meet the agreed specifications; and

> (b)     Mr Loo had verbally agreed to collect them back at a later date when the plaintiff delivered the Food Processor to the defendant.

49     Such evidence demonstrates that the defendant had accepted the plaintiff’s repudiatory breach by rejecting the Trolleys, thus bringing the contract to an end (see _Benjamin’s Sale of Goods_ at \[12-027\]), and that the plaintiff had understood that to be the effect of the defendant’s actions.

50     I therefore find that the plaintiff is not entitled to the invoiced amounts for the Trolleys totalling S$6,955.00.

#### The accessories for the Trolleys were of satisfactory quality

51     Turning to the accessories for the Trolleys (_ie_, the rest of the items listed in INV18178), the defendant’s case is that the accessories were not of satisfactory quality and in fact, the tablecloth for the 7-11 Trolley was torn when delivered.[^42]

52     While the parties have grouped the question of whether the accessories were of satisfactory quality under the broader issue of whether the Showroom Equipment supplied conformed to the agreed specifications, the two matters are distinct and should not be conflated. The defendant does not dispute that the accessories conformed to the agreed specifications, and takes issue only with the quality of the accessories. Hence, the burden rests on the defendant to prove that the plaintiff had breached the implied term under section 14(2) of the SOGA that the accessories supplied are of satisfactory quality, and that the breach entitled the defendant to reject the accessories.

53     Apart from alleging that the tablecloth for the 7-11 Trolley was torn, the defendant has not explained how the accessories were not of satisfactory quality. More fundamentally, the defendant failed to disclose any evidence that any of the accessories were not of satisfactory quality, whether in terms of fitness for purpose, appearance and finish, safety, durability or otherwise.

54     In the premises, I find that the defendant has not discharged its burden of proving that the accessories were not of satisfactory quality. The plaintiff is entitled to the invoiced amounts for the accessories, which total S$2,726.36.

### Issue 3: Whether there was an agreement between the parties for the rental of the Forklift

55     The plaintiff’s case is that on 3 September 2018, the defendant was moving its factory from Kaki Bukit to 15 Senoko Drive, but its movers did not provide any forklift for the move. Thus, Ms Li and one of her managers approached Mr Loo to rent a forklift for loading and unloading heavy equipment. Mr Loo provided the defendant a quotation for its confirmation. Upon receiving such confirmation, the plaintiff rented the Forklift from Neo Royale Logistics and Construction Pte Ltd (“Neo Royale”) which it in turn provided to the defendant for its use.[^43]

56     I find that the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proving that there was an agreement between the parties for the rental of the Forklift. The plaintiff has not disclosed the quotation which it had allegedly issued to the defendant for the rental of the Forklift, or any objective evidence that the defendant had approved the quotation. Moreover, there are material inconsistencies between the plaintiff’s case and the documentary evidence. I give two examples of such inconsistencies:

> (a)     Mr Loo testified during cross-examination that the plaintiff had rented the Forklift to the defendant for a week from 3 to 10 September 2018.[^44] However, INV18214 states that the duration of the rental was one month.[^45]

> (b)     Neo Royale’s invoice to the plaintiff for the rental of the Forklift stated that the rental was for a week from 17 to 23 September 2018.[^46] However, it would be impossible for the plaintiff to rent the forklift from Neo Royale from 17 to 23 September 2021, and then go back in time to rent the same forklift to the defendant from 3 to 10 September 2018.[^47]

57     On the other hand, the defendant’s case that it did not agree to rent the Forklift from the plaintiff is amply supported by the evidence. Ms Li had explained in her AEIC and at trial that the defendant did not require a Forklift from the plaintiff for the relocation of its factory because it had engaged two moving companies to move all its equipment, and she had exhibited the invoices and payment vouchers showing such engagements.[^48]

58     In the circumstances, the plaintiff is not entitled to payment on INV18214.

### Issue 4: Whether the Kitchen Equipment installed by the plaintiff was in accordance with the agreed specifications

#### The agreed specifications of the Kitchen Equipment

59     The plaintiff’s case is that on 10 September 2018, the defendant contacted the plaintiff for the installation of the Kitchen Equipment at its factory, and provided the dimensions of the equipment. On 14 September 2018, the plaintiff supplied the Kitchen Equipment to the defendant. The plaintiff installed the Kitchen Equipment in the kitchen of the defendant’s factory based on the defendant’s requirements. There were no complaints from the defendant to the plaintiff regarding the Kitchen Equipment until the present suit.[^49]

60     I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s case. If the defendant had provided the dimensions of the Kitchen Equipment to the plaintiff, there ought to be documentary evidence of this, such as an email, a text message or even a piece of paper from the defendant to the plaintiff setting out the requisite dimensions. The plaintiff has not disclosed any such evidence.

61     In my judgment, the defendant’s case is more probable, namely that:[^50]

> (a)     during one of Mr Loo’s visits to the defendant’s factory in August 2018, Mr Loo informed Ms Li that under the regulations of the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (“AVA”), the defendant was required to install the Kitchen Equipment, and the Partition Plate had to cover the entire wall of the kitchen from floor to ceiling;

> (b)     Ms Li agreed for the plaintiff to install the Kitchen Equipment for the defendant according to the relevant regulations. She only asked that the Kitchen Tables be custom-made to be flushed against the walls of the kitchen;

> (c)     Ms Li then allowed Mr Loo to walk around the defendant’s factory to take the necessary measurements for the installation of the Kitchen Equipment.

62     This was Ms Li’s evidence in her AEIC, which she did not waver from under cross examination.[^51]

63     Accordingly, I find that the parties had agreed that:

> (a)     the Kitchen Equipment would be installed according to the relevant AVA regulations. This entailed, among other things, that the Partition Plate would cover the entire wall from floor to ceiling; and

> (b)     the Preparation Tables would be flushed against the walls of the kitchen in the defendant’s factory.

#### The Kitchen Equipment did not meet the agreed specifications

64     It is Ms Li’s evidence that the Kitchen Equipment installed by the plaintiff did not meet the agreed specifications because:[^52]

> (a)     the Partition Plate did not completely cover the wall of the kitchen of the defendant’s factory: it stopped at the halfway mark. As a result, when the defendant’s employees washed and cleaned the kitchen, water could easily enter the gap between the Partition Plate and the wall; and

> (b)     the Preparation Tables could not be flushed against the walls of the kitchen. There were gaps between the back of the tables and the wall. For two of the Preparation Tables, there were also gaps between the sides of the tables and the wall. As a result, items such as food waste could easily pass through the gaps and get trapped between the Preparation Tables and the walls. It was not easy to clear food waste in this gap as it was very narrow and difficult to access. This would lead to cleanliness and hygiene problems.

65     I accept Ms Li’s evidence that the Kitchen Equipment installed by the plaintiff did not meet the agreed specifications. Her evidence is amply supported by various photographs of the Partition Plate and the Preparation Tables exhibited in her AEIC.[^53] Furthermore, her evidence was not challenged by the plaintiff.

66     The plaintiff made various arguments to the effect that the non-compliance with the agreed specifications was not attributable to any fault of the plaintiff and in any event, would not lead to cleanliness and hygiene problems. These arguments are summarised below:[^54]

> (a)     Ms Li’s evidence that the gaps between the Kitchen Equipment and the walls would result in food waste being stuck in the gaps was wholly unsubstantiated. On the contrary, such gaps would allow any waste that falls into the gaps to be easily flushed out using a water hose;

> (b)     the Preparation Tables could not be flushed against the walls for reasons out of the plaintiff’s control, namely that there were pre-existing pipes and/or electrical casing at the back of the said tables;

> (c)     the gap between the Partition Plate and the wall may have arisen because a bolt in the Partition Plate was dislodged from its place possibly due to reasonable wear and tear. This was a minor issue which could easily be rectified by the defendant.

67     In my view, the plaintiff is not entitled to argue that it was not at fault for the non-compliance with the agreed specifications and that such non-compliance would not lead to cleanliness and hygiene problems. These arguments were not part of its pleaded case, and were only raised for the first time in its closing submissions (where \[66(a) and (c)\] above is concerned) or at trial (where \[66(b)\] above is concerned[^55]). If the plaintiff was permitted to make these arguments, the defendant would be prejudiced in a manner which cannot be compensated by costs as it has not had reasonable opportunity to adduce evidence to rebut these arguments.

68     In any event, these arguments have no merit as they are simply submissions from the bar. None of the plaintiff’s witnesses gave evidence to support these arguments.

69     In the premises, I find that the Kitchen Equipment did not meet the agreed specifications, and that the non-compliance with the agreed specifications led to cleanliness and hygiene problems.

#### The defendant had rejected the Kitchen Equipment

70     The plaintiff submitted that even if the Kitchen Equipment did not conform to the agreed specifications, the defendant did not reject the Kitchen Equipment, but instead continued to use them as seen from the photographs exhibited in Ms Li’s AEIC. Moreover, the defendant did not raise any issues with INV18226 within a reasonable time after the Kitchen Equipment was delivered and the invoice was issued. The defendant had thus accepted the Kitchen Equipment, and/or is deemed to have accepted the Kitchen Equipment pursuant to section 35(4) of the SOGA.[^56]

71     I find that the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proving that the defendant had used the Kitchen Equipment. The plaintiff relies solely on the photographs of the Kitchen Equipment exhibited in Ms Li’s AEIC to demonstrate that the defendant had used the Kitchen Equipment. However, the photographs simply show that there were some pots, pans and woks placed on the stoves on top of the Preparation Tables.[^57] That, in itself, does not prove that the Preparation Tables were used for food preparation. None of the plaintiff’s witnesses were cross examined on the reason for the presence of pots, pans and woks on the Preparation Tables. It is therefore unclear whether such cooking equipment had simply been placed there without more, or if the Preparation Tables had in fact been used for food preparation.

72     Even if the defendant had in fact used the Kitchen Equipment, I am of the view that such usage does not indicate that the defendant had accepted the Kitchen Equipment.

73     Under section 35(4) of the SOGA, a buyer is “deemed to have accepted the goods when after the lapse of a reasonable time he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them”. In _Sun Qi (formerly trading as Power King International) and another v Syscon Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 38</span> (“_Sun Qi_”), the Singapore High Court held that section 35(4) did not apply on the facts, even though the buyer had used the goods for several months: see _Sun Qi_ at \[32\]. The buyer had immediately alerted the seller of potential defects in the goods as and when they arose, and the seller had assured the buyer that the goods would be brought up to specification. Thus, the Court took the view that the buyer had not lost its right of rejection simply by failing to immediately reject the goods once the defects were discovered and by continuing to use the goods: see _Sun Qi_ at \[42\].

74     In the present case, it is Ms Li’s evidence that she had complained to Mr Loo about the problems with the Kitchen Equipment when he visited the defendant’s factory. Mr Loo had acknowledged that the equipment did not fulfil the parties’ agreement, and stated that he would rectify the problems with the Kitchen Equipment during the installation of the Food Processor as he would have the necessary tools and materials then and it would be more convenient for him to fix the problems at one go. However, the plaintiff has not rectified the Kitchen Equipment to-date. Ms Li had contacted Mr Loo many times to fix the problems with the Kitchen Equipment, but Mr Loo kept giving her excuses, for example, that he was overseas or that he was warded in the hospital.[^58]

75     I accept Ms Li’s evidence. In light of the cleanliness and hygiene issues caused by the non-compliance of the Kitchen Equipment with the agreed specifications (see \[64\]–\[69\] above), I find it more likely than not that Ms Li would have complained to Mr Loo about the problems with the Kitchen Equipment and that Mr Loo would have agreed to rectify the problems with the Kitchen Equipment. In making this finding, I also bore in mind that at the time Ms Li had raised such complaints to Mr Loo, the entire Food Processor had yet to be delivered and installed, and the defendant had yet to make full payment for the Food Processor. Mr Loo therefore had the incentive to remain on good terms with the defendant by, among other things, promising to rectify the problems with the Kitchen Equipment.

76     By complaining to Mr Loo about the problems with the Kitchen Equipment and asking him to rectify those problems, the defendant had intimated that it did not accept the Kitchen Equipment in the condition that it was delivered. My view that the defendant had not accepted the Kitchen Equipment is fortified by the letter dated 11 March 2020 issued by the defendant’s solicitors to the plaintiff’s solicitors. In \[3(b)\] of that letter, the defendant’s solicitors responded to the plaintiff’s demand for payment of the Invoices, stating that the defendant had not paid the invoices because among other things, the invoices concerned “items which specifications are incorrect and do not match our client’s requirements”.[^59]

77     Consequently, the plaintiff is not entitled to payment on INV18226.

### Issue 5: Whether the Flour Machines supplied by the plaintiff were in accordance with the parties’ agreement

#### The agreed specifications of the Flour Machines

78     The plaintiff’s case is that on 10 October 2018, the defendant contacted the plaintiff for a vacuum dough mixer and a mixing machine for dry flour, and the plaintiff provided the defendant with the specifications of, and its quotation for, the Flour Machines. After the defendant provided its confirmation, the plaintiff supplied the Flour Machines and the instruction manuals for these machines to the defendant, and issued INV18277 on 11 November 2018.[^60]

79     I am unable to accept the plaintiff’s case as it is wholly unsubstantiated. The plaintiff has not adduced any objective evidence of the specifications, quotation and instruction manuals which it had allegedly provided to the defendant, or the defendant’s confirmation of the said specifications and quotation. In the premises, it is not even clear what the plaintiff says the agreed specifications of the Flour Machines are.

80     Instead, I prefer the defendant’s case that the parties had agreed that the Flour Machines would be of the same specifications as the defendant’s existing flour machines, except with a larger capacity to process 100kg of flour.[^61] In Ms Li’s AEIC, she stated that during one of Mr Loo’s visits to the defendant’s factory in or around August 2018, she had requested him to supply Flour Machines of the same specifications as their existing flour machines but with a larger capacity to process 100kg of flour, and Mr Loo had agreed to deliver the same without providing any written quotation or specifications.[^62] Ms Li maintained her account under cross examination, explaining that Mr Loo was well aware of the defendant’s requirements for the Flour Machines as she had pointed out the defendant’s existing machines to Mr Loo while he was at the defendant’s factory.[^63] I find her account to be credible, and consistent with the fact that no written quotation, specifications or instruction manuals for the Flour Machines are in evidence before me.

#### The Flour Machines did not meet the agreed specifications

81     The plaintiff’s case is that it had supplied the Flour Machines according to the agreed specifications, and therefore Mr Loo did not agree to take back the Flour Machines.[^64]

82     The plaintiff argued that the ability of the Flour Machines to process up to 100kg of floor can be reasonably inferred from the fact that a power trip had occurred at the defendant’s factory when the defendant attempted to use the Flour Machines. The power trip suggested that the Flour Machines required more power, and therefore could process a substantially greater amount of flour, than the defendant’s existing flour machines.[^65]

83     The defendant’s case is that the Flour Machines were not of the same specifications as their existing flour machines, and were not able to process up to 100kg of flour. Consequently, Ms Li informed Mr Loo to take back the Flour Machines, and Mr Loo agreed to do so at a later date when the plaintiff delivered the Food Processor to the defendant’s factory. However, to-date, the plaintiff has not taken back the Flour Machines.[^66]

84     I find that the plaintiff has not discharged its burden of proving that the Flour Machines met the agreed specifications. No objective evidence has been adduced by the plaintiff to show that the Flour Machines met the agreed specifications. Furthermore, there is no merit to the plaintiff’s argument regarding the power trip. While it is undisputed that a power trip had occurred when the defendant attempted to use the Flour Machines, none of the plaintiff’s witnesses gave evidence that the power trip arose because the Flour Machines required more power than the defendant’s existing flour machines and that this showed that the Flour Machines could process a substantially greater amount of flour than the defendant’s existing machines. The plaintiff’s argument regarding the power trip is no more than an unsubstantiated submission from the bar.

#### The defendant had rejected the Flour Machines

85     The plaintiff submitted that even if the Flour Machines did not conform to the agreed specifications, the defendant did not reject them, but instead continued to use them. Moreover, the defendant did not raise any issues with INV18227 within a reasonable time after the Flour Machines were delivered and the invoice was issued. The defendant is thus deemed to have accepted the Flour Machines pursuant to section 35(4) of the SOGA.[^67]

86     The defendant’s case, as set out at \[83\] above, is that it had rejected the Flour Machines.

87     I find that the defendant had rejected the Flour Machines. Given that the Flour Machines did not comply with the agreed specification, it is more likely than not that Ms Li had demanded that Mr Loo take back the Flour Machines because they were completely different from what the plaintiff had agreed to supply. I also accept that Mr Loo had acceded to Ms Li’s demand and informed her that he would collect the Flour Machines at the time the plaintiff delivered the Food Processor to the defendant.[^68] That is consistent with Mr Loo’s agreement to collect other items, namely the Nitrogen Equipment and the Trolleys, from the defendant’s premises at the time the plaintiff delivered the Food Processor (see \[32\], \[33\] and \[48\] above).

88     In the premises, the plaintiff is not entitled to payment on INV18277.

### Issue 6: Whether there was an agreement between the parties for the installation of the compressed air pipeline for the sum of S$3,200.00

89     The plaintiff’s case is that the installation of the compressed air pipeline was necessitated by the defendant changing the location of the Food Processor from a position where there was an air pipeline (which was required for the operation of the Food Processor) to a position where there was no such pipeline. The plaintiff had issued the defendant a quotation for the installation of the compressed air pipeline, and had sent an email to the defendant for confirmation. The plaintiff then proceeded to install the air pipeline at the new position and issued INV19009 for the sum of S$3,210.00.[^69]

90     To support its case, the plaintiff disclosed several layout plans which purportedly show that the position of the Food Processor had been changed (the “Layout Plans”).[^70]

91     I find that the plaintiff’s case is not substantiated by the evidence. The plaintiff has not disclosed the quotation or the email which it had allegedly issued to the defendant for the installation of the compressed air pipeline. Furthermore, the Layout Plans disclosed by the plaintiff were undated. It is thus unclear from the face of these plans:

> (a)     how the position of the Food Processor had been changed over time;

> (b)     what was the final position of the Food Processor the defendant had settled on; and

> (c)     whether there was indeed no air pipeline in that final position. In this regard, I note that air pipelines were indicated on four out of the five layout plans.[^71]

92     No explanation of the Layout Plans was provided by the plaintiff’s witnesses, whether in their AEICs or at trial, to clarify these matters. There is also no objective evidence that the defendant had in fact asked the plaintiff to change the location of the Food Processor, and that the Layout Plans were prepared pursuant to such requests from the defendant.

93     I prefer the defendant’s case that the plaintiff had agreed to install the compressed air pipeline at no cost,[^72] as it is amply supported by the evidence.

94     On 26 June 2018, Mr Loo had sent the following text message to Ms Li:[^73]

> “I will prepare the quotation and proposal. Will need you to sign and collect deposit. After that will need to submit to I spring/psg \[sic\] for grant. _If you want, I can add the air compressor together into 1 so that u can save on the air compressor oso_”. (emphasis added)

95     It is Ms Li’s evidence in her AEIC that when she met Mr Loo sometime later, he explained the text message to her, stating that he would supply the defendant a compressed air pipeline without any charge as part of the defendant’s purchase of the Food Processor. She agreed to the offer since it meant that the defendant would be able to save on the cost of a compressed air pipeline.[^74]

96     Ms Li’s evidence stands unchallenged. Mr Loo did not offer any contrary explanation of how the text message should be interpreted.

97     In any event, I am of the view that Ms Li’s evidence coheres with the plain wording of the text message read in light of its relevant context. The phrase “save on the air compressor” suggests that the defendant did not have to pay for the compressed airpipe. Moreover, it is common ground between the parties that Mr Loo had furnished the Proposal for the Food Processor to Ms Li in or around June or July 2018 (see \[6(a)\] above), and that the defendant had applied for an iSPRINT grant for the Food Processor.[^75] In light of these facts, the “quotation and proposal” mentioned in the text message is plainly the plaintiff’s quotation and proposal for the Food Processor, which is in line with Ms Li’s account of how Mr Loo had explained the meaning of the text message to her. This reinforces the credibility of Ms Li’s evidence.

98     In its closing submissions, the plaintiff argued that the text message simply means that the costs of the air compressor would be added into the quotation and/or proposal that was to be submitted in the application for the iSPRINT grant.[^76] I am unable to accept that argument as it is merely a submission from the bar.

99     Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff had agreed to install the compressed air pipeline without any charge, and is not entitled to claim on INV19009.

## The defendant’s counterclaim

100    I now turn to the defendant’s counterclaim.

### The components and actual workflow of the Food Processor

101    To understand the parties’ respective positions on the counterclaim, one must first appreciate the different components, and the actual workflow, of the Food Processor. I therefore set out the following uncontroversial description of the workings of the Food Processor:[^77]

> (a)     The first component of the Food Processor is the peeling machine, whose purpose is to wash and peel the turnips.

> (b)     After the washed and peeled turnips exit the peeling machine, they are to be transferred to a slicing machine for slicing.

> (c)     The sliced turnips are to be transported into a cooking tank to be blanched, mixed and cooked. This is done by a blue conveyor belt which transports the sliced turnips into a metal container located at the other end of the conveyor belt. The metal container is then transported up an elevator automatically.

> (d)     After the cooked turnips exit the cooking tank, they are to be transferred to the weigher and then the packaging machine to be packed into individual bags. This is done through a series of equipment which constitute the weigher and the packaging machine. The cooked turnips will first fall into a bucket conveyor at the bottom of the cooking tank, which transports them to a screw conveyor and subsequently a metering auger feeding system. The metering auger feeding system then splits the cooked turnips into fixed amounts through a dumping hopper. The fixed amounts of cooked turnips are then transported along a green conveyor, and through a feeder, into individual orange cups along the cup conveyor and to the packaging station.

> (e)     Finally, the packed bags are sent to the retort system to sterilise their contents.

### Mr Tan’s qualifications, experience and credibility

102    Before delving into the issues arising from the counterclaim, I first address Mr Tan’s qualifications, experience and credibility as the defendant relied heavily on his expert evidence in support of its counterclaim.

103    The plaintiff challenged Mr Tan’s expert evidence on the ground that he does not possess the necessary qualifications and experience to provide expert evidence in relation to the Food Processor and that his evidence lacked credibility. Specifically, the plaintiff submitted that:[^78]

> (a)     Mr Tan’s resume did not list any experience dealing with food processors for turnips. Mr Tan claimed at trial that he had such experience, but had omitted to include it in his resume because he had too many experiences with food processors to list all of them. That is a feeble excuse: it is incredible that an expert witness called to evaluate the Food Processor would fail to mention in his resume that he had experience dealing with similar turnip processors.

> (b)     Apart from the peeling machine and the slicing machine, Mr Tan did not test the other components of the Food Processor. This significantly restricts the depth and scope of his expert evidence, which should be accorded little weight.

> (c)     Mr Tan had gone beyond the scope of his expert evidence to consider the merchantability of the Food Processor.

104    I am unable to accept the aforementioned grounds relied upon by the plaintiff to challenge Mr Tan’s expert evidence.

105    In my view, Mr Tan is qualified to provide expert evidence in relation to the Food Processor. It is settled law that while an expert must be skilled, he need not be so by special study or professional qualifications: he may be so by experience: see _Zweite Ms “Philippa Schulte” Shipping GmbH & Co KG & Another v PSA Corp Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 135</span> at \[130\]–\[135\].[^79] I find that Mr Tan has sufficient working experience to comment on whether the Food Processor is fully automated and of satisfactory quality. On a perusal of Mr Tan’s resume, he has at least 15 years of experience – from 2005 until the present day – in designing, assembling and supplying a wide range of automated food processing systems, ranging from curry powder to biscotti to barbecued meats.[^80] While none of the automated food processing systems listed in his resume pertain to turnips, I accept Mr Tan’s evidence that the same food management principles that applied in those systems would apply to the processing of turnips;[^81] the plaintiff has not adduced any evidence to suggest otherwise.

106    On the whole, Mr Tan struck me as a credible witness. His views were measured, cogent, and largely supported by (a) photographs and/or videos taken during his inspection of the Food Processor and his test runs on the peeling machine and the slicing machine, and (b) the videos taken by the defendant’s employees during the training session conducted by Mr Loo and his brother, at the defendant’s factory in late May 2019, on how to operate the Food Processor (the “May 2019 Training”). This will become apparent from my analysis of Issue 7, 9 and 10 below. Mr Tan also did not seek to embellish his evidence to support the defendant’s counterclaim. To give two examples:

> (a)     Mr Tan frankly admitted that he did not know (i) whether the Food Processor complied with the design and blueprints agreed between the parties because he had not been provided with such design and blueprints, and (ii) whether someone had meddled with the Food Processor before he examined it.[^82]

> (b)     During cross examination, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Teo, referred Mr Tan to an Inspection Certificate dated 5 November 2018 issued by ABS Consulting (“the Boiler Inspection Certificate”),[^83] and asked whether this certificate meant that the boiler of the Food Processor was safe. Mr Tan readily agreed.[^84] He added that this was why he did not include the boiler in his expert report: there was no issue with the boiler.[^85]

107    I do not agree with the plaintiff that Mr Tan’s evidence should be accorded little weight simply because he had operated only the peeling machine and the slicing machine. As seen from my analysis on Issues 7(c), (d), (f), (g), 9 and 10 below, Mr Tan’s evidence on the other components of the Food Processor pertained largely to issues which could be gleaned from a visual inspection of the Food Processor coupled with his experience in designing, assembling and supplying automated food processing systems. Thus, I do not think that Mr Tan had to be able to operate the entire Food Processor in order to give a sound opinion on those issues.

108    In relation to the plaintiff’s complaint that Mr Tan had gone beyond the scope of his expert evidence, I accept that Mr Tan’s statement in \[10(e)\] of his expert report on the merchantability of the metering auger feeding system does fall outside the issues set out in \[4\] of that report (_ie_, whether the Food Processor is fully automated and of satisfactory quality). However, Mr Tan had explained at trial that he had made that statement because the defendant had requested him to comment on whether the metering auger feeding system could be sold.[^86] More crucially, that statement is the only portion of Mr Tan’s evidence which the plaintiff had identified as falling outside the issues set out in \[4\] of his expert report. It does not detract from the credibility of the rest of Mr Tan’s evidence on the Food Processor.

### Issue 7: Whether the Food Processor conformed to the agreed specifications or was non-functional and defective

#### (a)   Whether the peeling machine is able to peel raw turnips completely and has capacity to process up to 300kg of turnips

109    The defendant’s case is that the peeling machine is not able to peel raw turnips completely, and does not have the capacity to process 300kg of turnips per batch. Instead, the peeling machine can only peel 50kg of turnips per batch.[^87]

110    The plaintiff denied that the peeling machine is unable to peel raw turnips completely. As for the capacity of the peeling machine, the plaintiff’s position is that the peeling machine is supposed to produce 300kg of peeled turnips per hour, and not per batch.[^88]

111    I find that the peeling machine is not able to peel raw turnips completely. It is Mr Aung’s unchallenged evidence that during the May 2019 Training, he had observed that:[^89]

> (a)     the turnips which came out of the peeling machine were not peeled completely. There would still be some skin remaining on the surface of the turnips;

> (b)     in order for the turnips to be peeled completely, they would have to remain in the peeling machine for a longer amount of time. Since the turnip flesh would be peeled off together with the turnip skin in the peeling machine, based on Mr Aung’s estimate, a 1kg unpeeled turnip would yield only 300 to 400g of the turnip flesh if all the turnip skin had to be removed completely by the peeling machine.

112    Mr Aung’s evidence coheres with the following observations of Mr Tan on the peeling machine, which I find to be logical, internally consistent, and supported by objective evidence.

> (a)     Mr Tan opined that the maximum capacity of the peeling machine was only about 80kg and even at that capacity, the machine could not function efficiently. This is based on a test run Mr Tan conducted on the peeling machine with 80kg of turnips. During that test run, the turnips were not able to turn effectively in the machine and could not be washed and peeled by the brushes in the machine, as they were too closely packed. Mr Aung had to use a metal spoon to manually move the turnips inside the peeling machine, as seen in the photograph in Figure 5 of Mr Tan’s expert report.[^90]

> (b)     Mr Tan further observed that the peeling machine could not function efficiently with just 50kg of turnips.[^91] To substantiate his observation, Mr Tan exhibited: (i) a video taken during his test run of the machine using a few turnips, which showed that the turnips in the machine were barely moving, and (ii) a photograph of Mr Aung using a metal spoon to move the turnips which were unable to turn in the peeling machine during the test run.[^92] Mr Tan explained that the turnips were unable to roll and turn in the machine because there was insufficient space inside the machine, and the bristles of the rotating brushes in the machine, which were used to wash and peel the turnips, were too hard.[^93]

> (c)     Mr Tan also opined that during his test runs on the peeling machine, he observed that the rotating brushes in the machine stayed stagnant and did not spin smoothly. As a result, for the test run where 50kg of turnips were used, the turnips were barely peeled by the 12th minute, which was slower than the same process being conducted manually by the defendant’s employees on-site.[^94]

113    The plaintiff did not adduce any objective evidence to challenge the aforementioned problems which Mr Aung and Mr Tan had identified with the peeling machine. In my view, it is reasonable to infer that these problems resulted in the inability of the machine to peel raw turnips completely.

114    I now turn to the capacity of the peeling machine. Page 6 of the Quotation simply states the peeling machine has a “Capacity: 300kg” without more.[^95] The issue is whether this means 300kg per batch or 300kg per hour. Neither party made arguments in their closing submissions on why their respective interpretations of the phrase “Capacity: 300kg” should be preferred. I hold that on a proper construction of that phrase, the plaintiff had contracted to provide a peeling machine with a capacity to process 300kg of turnips per batch. This interpretation accords with the ordinary and natural meaning of the phrase “Capacity: 300kg”. It is also consistent with the rest of the Quotation. For the item “steam generator by Citygas” on page 4 of the Quotation, the plaintiff had expressly stipulated that it had a steam capacity of “1.5ton/hr”.[^96] Thus, if the plaintiff had intended to supply a peeling machine with the capacity to process 300kg of turnips per hour, I would expect them to have expressly stated so in the Quotation.

115    Based on Mr Tan’s evidence set out at \[112(a)–(b)\] above, I find that the peeling machine does not have the capacity to process 300kg of turnips per batch. Its actual maximum capacity is only 80kg, and that even at that much reduced capacity, the machine cannot function efficiently. This is clearly a breach of the Turnip System Agreement.

#### (b)   Whether the agreed specifications placed any restrictions on the size of the turnips that could be processed

116    The defendant’s case is that the agreed specifications of the Food Processor did not place any restrictions on the size of the turnips that could be processed.[^97]

117    The plaintiff’s case, based on Mr Loo’s evidence at trial, is that it had provided documents and videos to the defendant which specified the size of the turnips that could be processed by the Food Processor.[^98] In particular, during the pre-contractual discussions, the plaintiff had informed the defendant that the operator must cut large turnips into half before feeding them into the peeling machine or the slicing machine, and had illustrated this to Mr Li by sending her a video and conducting a live demonstration during the Visit to China.[^99]

118    I find that the agreed specifications of the Food Processor did not place any restrictions on the size of the turnips that could be processed. Nothing in the documents comprising the Turnip System Agreement states that the Food Processor can only process turnips up to a certain size. I do not accept Mr Loo’s evidence that the plaintiff had provided documents and videos to the defendant which specified the size of the turnips that could be processed by the Food Processor. No such documents and videos were adduced.

#### (c)   Whether the Food Processor is fully automated

119    The defendant’s case is that while the parties had agreed that the Food Processor would be fully automated, the Food Processor supplied by the plaintiff was not so.[^100]

120    The plaintiff’s case is that the parties had agreed that the Food Processor would be fully automated only from the cooking tank to the sealing of the packaging bags, and that the Food Processor had complied with this agreement. At the point of delivery of the Food Processor to the defendant on 20 December 2018, the Food Processor was not defective.[^101]

##### (1)   Whether the parties had agreed that the Food Processor would be fully automated

121    In my judgment, the parties had agreed that the Food Processor would be fully automated. This agreement is evident from the following contemporaneous objective evidence.

122    First, it is undisputed that the “After implement” section of the Proposal describes the food processing system which the plaintiff was required to supply the defendant.[^102] That section provides that:[^103]

> “After Implement:

>> a.)    User to pour raw product into elevator.

>> b.)    Elevator will transport the turnip into the wash and peel machine.

>> c.)    After completion, Turnip will be transfer out to the slicing machine by conveyor

>> d.)    After slicing, product will be sent through inspection conveyor so that operator can check and ensure product is properly slice.

>> e.)    Slice product will be automatically transport into cooking tank for hot water blanching. Cold water blanching, mixing and cooking in 1 single tank (Multi-function tank so as to save production space.). Cooking Tank can also use for sauce production.

>> f.)    Product are automatically transfer into weigher for packaging machine so as to obtain accurate packet weight. For sauce it will be transfer by rotary pump. (Dual function for the packaging machine).

>> g.)    Packaging machine are able to feed the required bag, print expired date, filling of product, and sealing.

>> h.)    After product is packed, it will go through weight checked and Metal detector as to provide excellent quality and quantity control.

>> i.)    Pack Product are then sent into the retort system for killing bacteria inside the bag. (by Operator)

>> j.)    For ready to eat product, it will be sent to Liquid nitrogen Cabinet to obtain excellent quality control for consumer to eat.”

123    On a plain reading of that section, the Food Processor is to be fully automated in the sense that beyond feeding raw turnips into the Food Processor, operating the Food Processor, and manually placing the packed turnips into the retort system (see steps (a), (d) and (i) of that section), no manual labour is required for the processing of turnips.

124    I therefore accept Ms Li’s evidence that when Mr Loo handed her the Proposal in or around June or July 2018, he had explained the details of the Proposal to her in Mandarin, and based on his explanation, the Food Processor would be fully automated.[^104]

125    Second, it is undisputed that the Equipment List forms part of the Turnip System Agreement, that Ms Li had written in Chinese at the bottom of the Equipment List that “_These accessories can fully automate the machine_”, and that Mr Loo had signed next to those words.[^105]

126    Ms Li explained this handwritten sentence in her AEIC[^106] and at trial[^107] as follows:

> (a)     after Mr Loo handed her the Quotation, the Equipment List, the Retort Specifications and the document titled “Job Completion Time Frame and Payment Term” in or around June and July 2018, she had checked with Mr Loo that the Food Processor would be fully automated because she did not understand English and was not familiar with the technical specifications of the Food Processor;

> (b)     Mr Loo confirmed that the Food Processor would be fully automated in accordance with the specifications set out in the Quotation, Equipment List and the Retort Specifications;

> (c)     in light of Mr Loo’s confirmation, Ms Li wrote down in Chinese on the first page of the Equipment List that the Food Processor would be fully automated to ensure that there was no doubt between parties on this particular requirement. Mr Loo read her handwritten sentence and signed at the end of it.

127    Mr Loo, on the other hand, testified that he had signed next to Ms Li’s handwritten sentence because the Equipment List only related to cooking and blanching, and not the earlier processes handled by the Food Processor.[^108]

128    I prefer Ms Li’s evidence in relation to her handwritten sentence, as it is consistent with the “After implement” section of the Proposal and the Minutes (as defined below), both of which show that the Food Processor was to be fully automated.

129    Third, the plaintiff had disclosed the minutes of an internal meeting on 10 August 2018 between the sales department and the technical department of Henan International, in which the defendant’s requirements for the Food Processor were discussed (the “Minutes”). The Minutes were prepared by Henan International’s Ms Qiao, and signed by her and her colleague Mr Jiang Guibin (“Mr Jiang”).[^109] On the plaintiff’s own case, Henan International is the company which manufactured the Food Processor.[^110]

130    Crucially, the Minutes record that the defendant’s requirement was for a set of “_Fully Automated Equipment_”.[^111] This shows that the manufacturer of the Food Processor themselves understood that the Food Processor was to be fully automated, a point which Mr Loo conceded at trial.[^112]

131    The Minutes also set out the workflow of the Food Processor. Nothing in the workflow suggests that manual labour was required for the processing of turnips. The only mention of human involvement in the workflow was that an operator had to switch on the agitator of the cooking tank.[^113]

132    In their AEICs, Mr Loo and Ms Qiao relied on the Minutes to allege that:[^114]

> (a)     on or about 30 July 2018 (according to Ms Qiao) or 10 August 2018 (according to Mr Loo), Ms Li had visited the plaintiff’s factory in China together with Mr Loo to discuss the defendant’s requirements for the Food Processor. Ms Qiao and Mr Jiang were present during this meeting;

> (b)     during the meeting, they conducted a demonstration to Ms Li of the process of the working of the Food Processor and explained that the Food Processor could not function entirely as she expected because, among other things, the slicing and peeling of turnips could not be done 100% due to the shape of turnips. They also sent videos and photographs of the said process to Ms Li via WhatsApp and WeChat;

> (c)     after these discussions and demonstrations, Ms Li accepted the outcome before proceeding to confirm the defendant’s order for the Food Processor.

133    I do not find Mr Loo’s and Ms Qiao’s allegations to be credible as they are wholly unsubstantiated. The plaintiff did not disclose any of the videos and photographs that it had allegedly sent to Ms Li which demonstrate that the Food Processor could not function entirely as she expected. Moreover, there is no objective evidence of any meeting between Ms Li, Mr Loo, Ms Qiao and Mr Jiang on 30 July 2018 or 10 August 2018 at the plaintiff’s factory in China. Insofar as the plaintiff relies on the Minutes to support the existence of such a meeting, that is misguided. The Minutes refer to a meeting held on 10 August 2018 for which the only recorded attendees were the “Sales Department, Technical Department” of Henan International.[^115]

134    The incredibility of Mr Loo’s and Ms Qiao’s allegations is reinforced by the plaintiff’s inconsistent evidence on the date of the alleged meeting between Ms Li, Mr Loo, Ms Qiao and Mr Jiang in China. I had earlier mentioned that Mr Loo and Ms Qiao had proffered two different dates for the alleged meeting in their respective AEICs: see \[132(a)\] above. To compound the inconsistency, Mr Loo had, under cross examination, contradicted his evidence in his AEIC that the alleged meeting occurred on 10 August 2018:

> (a)     At trial, Mr Loo testified that the plaintiff had issued an invoice for the Showroom Equipment after he and Ms Li returned from the Visit to China, which was their one and only trip to China in 2018.[^116]

> (b)     In this regard, the plaintiff had issued an initial invoice for the Showroom Equipment to the defendant by email on 11 July 2018,[^117] and a final invoice for the Showroom Equipment to the defendant on 12 July 2018.[^118]

> (c)     Thus, based on Mr Loo’s evidence at trial, the Visit to China (and by logic, the alleged meeting between Ms Li, Mr Loo, Ms Qiao and Mr Jiang in China) must have taken place before 11 July 2018. This is consistent with Ms Li’s evidence that the Visit to China occurred from 5 to 8 July 2018.

135    I prefer Ms Li’s evidence that the Visit to China occurred from 5 to 8 July 2018, and that during that visit, she was not told that it was impossible for the plaintiff to meet the defendant’s requirement that the Food Processor be fully automated. Instead, Mr Loo had simply informed her that a single staff member would suffice to supervise the Food Processor and manage its computerised controls.[^119]

136    Leaving aside the contemporaneous objective evidence mentioned above, I find that there was no reason for the defendant to agree to purchase a Food Processor which could not fully automate the processing of turnips. I accept Ms Li’s evidence that since the defendant already had machinery to assist it in the processing of turnips, there was no need for the defendant to spend a hefty S$970,000 on the Food Processor if it could not fully automate the production process.[^120] This reinforces my finding that the parties had agreed that the Food Processor would be fully automated.

##### (2)   Whether the Food Processor is fully automated

(A)   The defendant’s arguments

137    Mr Aung and Mr Tan gave evidence on numerous aspects of the Food Processor which rendered it not fully automated. Mr Aung’s evidence was based primarily on his observations during the May 2019 Training, and videos of that training session taken by the defendant’s employees.[^121] Mr Tan’s evidence was based on his inspections of the Food Processor in October and November 2020, during which he had also conducted test runs on the peeling machine and the slicing machine.[^122]

138    The gist of their evidence is as follows:

> (a)     The turnips could not turn effectively in the peeling machine to be washed and peeled: they were too closely packed as the maximum capacity of the peeling machine was only about 80kg. Mr Aung had to use a metal spoon to manually move the turnips inside the peeling machine: see \[112(a)–(b)\] above.

> (b)     Some turnips would get stuck at the exit of the peeling machine because the lid at the exit was only able to open up to about 20 degrees.[^123] This issue arose because the pneumatic cylinder at the side of the peeling machine, which was used to open and close the lid, was misaligned in that the base of one side of the cylinder was not welded to the peeling machine. As a result, the lid could not open fully, and blocked the turnips from exiting the peeling machine.[^124]

> (c)     The exit of the peeling machine and the entrance of the slicing machine is connected by a metal slide. After the washed and peeled turnips exit the peeling machine onto the slide, they would get stuck along the slide because the angle of the slide was not steep enough for the turnips to roll down smoothly. The defendant’s workers had to manually push the turnips down the slide into the slicing machine.[^125]

> (d)     Turnips of a larger size would get stuck at the entrance of the slicing machine. Thus, the defendant’s workers had to cut such turnips into half before feeding them into the slicing machine.[^126] Moreover, some turnips would also get stuck inside the slicing machine, and to remedy this, the defendant’s workers had to stop the Food Processor, open the lid of the slicing machine, remove the stuck turnips and close the lid.[^127] These issues arose because the inlet of the slicing machine had a diameter of 180mm and the depth of the slicing machine was 110mm, but the average diameter of a turnip could be up to 150mm. Consequently, larger turnips might get stuck inside the slicing machine after they are fed into the inlet due to the lack of room.[^128] In support of this opinion, Mr Tan took a video which showed a large turnip being fed into the slicing machine and being stuck inside the machine and turning continuously without reaching the cutter.[^129]

> (e)     The lid of the metal container transferring sliced turnips to the cooking tank had to be manually closed and opened by an operator. There was no mechanism installed which allowed the lid to close and open automatically.[^130]

> (f)     Not all the sliced turnips would be emptied from the metal container into the cooking tank. Thus, the defendant’s workers had to ascend to a height to manually scoop the sliced turnips from the metal container into the cooking tank.[^131]

> (g)     A large amount of sliced turnips entering the cooking tank would get stuck in the stirring blade of the cooking tank and around the exit of the cooking tank. Mr Loo himself had to reach inside the cooking tank to remove these stuck turnips.[^132] This issue arose because the design of the stirring blade – which was completely horizontal – coupled with the viscosity of the cooked turnips, would prevent the cooked turnips from flowing to the bottom and towards the outlet of the cooking tank. The stirring blade should be slightly angled and not completely horizontal so as to stir the turnips more effectively.[^133]

> (collectively, the “Partly Automated Issues”)

(B)   The plaintiff’s arguments

139    The plaintiff submitted that at the time it delivered the Food Processor to the defendant on 20 December 2018, the Food Processor was working and did not have any defects. The plaintiff relied primarily on the following matters in support of its submission:[^134]

> (a)     Mr Loo’s evidence in \[16\] of his AEIC that the defendant paid the second instalment of the purchase price for the Food Processor and the Food Processor was completed and delivered to the defendant on 20 December 2018. The plaintiff claimed that this evidence was not challenged or contradicted.

> (b)     The plaintiff had conducted training for the defendant’s staff on how to operate the Food Processor in December 2018, January 2019 and May 2019. It is evident from the videos of the May 2019 Training that the Food Processor was working.

140    The plaintiff argued that any defects in the Food Processor only arose sometime in May 2019 and were caused by the defendant. In particular:[^135]

> (a)     the defendant had tampered with and altered the Food Processor;

> (b)     the defendant had failed to properly operate the Food Processor because (i) it had operated the Food Processor on manual mode instead of auto mode, and did not follow the operation manuals for the Food Processor, (ii) it had tested the cooking tank of the Food Processor using raw turnips instead of cooked turnips, and (iii) it did not know the duration of the peeling, blanching and cooking processes and the ratio of water to turnips required;

> (c)     the defendant did not ensure the cleanliness of the Food Processor after production;

> (d)     the defendant did not perform scheduled preventive maintenance of the Food Processor; and

> (e)     the defendant had made numerous requests to change the specifications of the Food Processor at the last minute after confirmation of the Quotation was given.

(C)   My findings

141    In my judgment, the Food Processor was not fully automated from the outset because it suffered from the Partly Automated Issues.

142    I accept Mr Aung and Mr Tan’s evidence on the existence and the causes of the Partly Automated Issues. Their evidence is substantiated by photographs and/or videos taken during the May 2019 Training and/or Mr Tan’s inspections of the Food Processor.[^136] In light of the Partly Automated Issues, it is plain and obvious that the Food Processor was not fully automated.

143    I do not see any merit in the plaintiff’s assertion that the Partly Automated Issues only arose sometime in May 2019 due to the defendant’s conduct, and prior to that, the Food Processor was not defective.

144    First, it is evident from \[138\] above that the causes of the Partly Automated Issues are (a) flaws in the design and/or construction of the Food Processor, and (b) in the case of the peeling machine, a breach of the contractually agreed capacity of the machine as well. These causes would have existed from the time the Food Processor was manufactured, and not only in or after May 2019.

145    Second, the parties’ email correspondence shows that as early as April 2019, the defendant had complained to the plaintiff that the Food Processor was not fully automated, and the plaintiff did not deny the complaint.

> (a)     On 23 April 2019, the defendant’s Ms Dawn Chew (“Ms Chew”) informed Mr Loo that the defendant would only pay the balance 20% of the purchase price for the Food Processor “upon the whole production system is fully functional”. Ms Chew also emphasised that “all processes should be automated, which is from raw materials till the finished product”, but that “todate, our production workers are still carrying out manual labour in the process”. Ms Chew stated that Ms Li would like to meet Mr Loo on 30 April 2019 for a discussion.[^137]

> (b)     Two days later on 25 April 2019, Ms Chew set out the defendant’s proposed agenda for the said meeting in an email to Mr Loo.[^138] The following were among the agenda items:

>> 1.    We have paid the 80% required sum for the full processing line. Which means the turnips need to be peeled, sliced, cooked and package (within the required range). Unfortunately, this process is not fully automate. We appreciate your clarification on this matter.

>> …

>> 10.    Due to failure of full automate process, we have to incur extra unnecessary cost which lead to loss of our company.”

> (c)     In Mr Loo’s response to the proposed agenda later that day,[^139] he did not deny that the Food Processor was not fully automated. He simply stated that “video will be provided as a proof that customer have accepted the result during the testing in our principle factory”, and that “issue is not by us. All evidence will be provided”.

> (d)     However, Mr Loo did not follow up with any video which showed that the defendant had accepted at the plaintiff’s factory that the Food Processor would not be fully automated.

146    Third, the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant had caused the Partly Automated Issues is wholly unsubstantiated. The plaintiff did not appoint an independent expert to inspect and conduct test runs on the Food Processor, in order to prove its case that the defendant had caused the Partly Automated Issues and that but for those issues, the Food Processor could function properly. Moreover, there is no objective evidence before me that:

> (a)     the defendant had tampered with and altered the Food Processor;

> (b)     the defendant had operated the Food Processor on manual mode instead of auto mode, without following the operation manuals for the Food Processor, and such manner of operation had caused the Partly Automated Issues;

> (c)     the defendant had tested the cooking tank of the Food Processor using raw turnips instead of cooked turnips. On the contrary, as Mr Aung had testified, the turnips in the cooking tank were partially cooked as they would soften after being soaked in the hot water in the cooking tank[^140];

> (d)     the partially cooked nature of the turnips caused them to get stuck in the stirring blade, and around the exit, of the cooking tank;

> (e)     the defendant’s lack of knowledge of the duration required for the peeling, blanching and cooking processors,[^141] and the ratio of water to turnips required, had caused the Partly Automated Issues;

> (f)     the defendant did not clean the Food Processor after production. In this regard, I accept Ms Li’s evidence that the defendant did clean the Food Processor (as it would otherwise be fined for hygiene issues), but it could not clean the Food Processor completely because some turnips were stuck in areas which were not accessible.[^142] Ms Li’s evidence is consistent with the defendant’s emails to the plaintiff on 11 and 14 June 2019 which listed a summary of the problems with the Food Processor. One such problem was that “_there was some turnips stuck inside the machine which was unable to clean up manually_” and “_we spent 2 days cannot even clean up the machine_”, and the defendant had attached photographs of the areas which could not be cleaned;[^143]

> (g)     the defendant’s inability to clean the Food Processor completely had caused the Partly Automated Issues;

> (h)     the defendant did not perform scheduled preventive maintenance of the Food Processor, and such failure had caused the Partly Automated Issues;

> (i)     the defendant had made numerous requests to change the specifications of the Food Processor after confirming the Quotation, and such requests had caused the Partly Automated Issues. In this regard, the only documentary evidence the plaintiff adduced in support of these alleged changes are the Layout Plans. But even if the specifications of the Food Processor differ between each of the Layout Plans (for which I express no view), there is no objective evidence that the defendant had requested the plaintiff to change the specifications, that the Layout Plans were prepared pursuant to such requests from the defendant, and that the changes to the specifications resulted in the Partly Automated Issues.

147    The unlikelihood that the defendant had caused the Partly Automated Issues is underscored by the fact that some of these issues were observed during the May 2019 Training. The plaintiff’s representatives were present during that training. Since the plaintiff had developed and customised the Food Processor, its representatives would have known how to properly operate the Food Processor (including the duration for the peeling, blanching and cooking processes and the ratio of the ingredients required), and would have ensured that the Food Processor was not tampered or altered, so that they could conduct the training smoothly.[^144]

148    In the premises, I find that the Food Processor was not fully automated in light of the Partly Automated Issues which existed from the outset. There is no evidence that the plaintiff had rectified the Partly Automated Issues, despite the numerous requests made by the defendant to the plaintiff to rectify these issues.[^145] The plaintiff was therefore in breach of the requirement in the Turnip System Agreement that the Food Processor would be fully automated.

#### (d)   Whether turnips would become stuck, or spill out, in the course of being processed

##### (1)   The defendant’s arguments

149    The defendant’s case is that turnips would become stuck, or spill out, in the course of being processed by the Food Processor. In support of its case, the defendant relied on the Partly Automated Issues set out at \[138(c),(d),(f),(g)\] above. The defendant also relied on the following evidence which was primarily from Mr Aung and Mr Tan:[^146]

> (a)     Turnips would shoot out from the exit of the slicing machine to a considerable height and distance, instead of falling onto the blue conveyor belt below the exit of the machine.[^147] This resulted in wastage of approximately 30% of sliced turnips. In an attempt to resolve this issue, Mr Loo installed a rectangular metal plate on one side of the blue conveyor belt to prevent the sliced turnips from shooting over the blue conveyor belt. However, this did not completely resolve the issue. Sliced turnips still fell to the floor as there was a gap between the blue conveyor belt and the exit of the slicing machine, and the area around the exit of the slicing machine was covered with remnants of sliced turnips.[^148]

> (b)     As the mouth of the cooking tank was much smaller than the elevated metal container containing the sliced turnips, only about 50% of the sliced turnips would enter the cooking tank. The remaining sliced turnips would fall on top of the cooking tank around its opening, or onto the floor.[^149]

> (c)     The sliced turnips would be transported along a blue conveyor belt to a metal container at the bottom of an elevator, and the container would then be hoisted up the elevator to the top of the cooking tank. However, there was a significant gap between the outlet of the slicing machine and the blue conveyor belt, which would cause the sliced turnips to fall onto the ground after exiting the outlet.[^150] Moreover, there was a large gap between the conveyor belt and the metal container, and the conveyor belt was also not fully aligned with the metal container. This would result in the sliced turnips on the conveyor belt falling onto the floor instead of the metal container.[^151]

> (d)     The flap at the outlet of the metal container, which was directed at the mouth of the cooking tank, was misaligned with the mouth of the cooking tank. Thus, there was a higher possibility of turnips falling outside of the cooking tank.[^152]

> (e)     At times, cooked turnips would get stuck at the exit of the cooking tank, such that random splatters of cooked turnips and water would come out of the cooking tank.[^153] This issue arose because the diameter of the outlet of the cooking tank was too small and the base of the cooking tank was not sufficiently tapered and steep, as a result of which there would be a bottleneck of cooked turnips stuck at the outlet.[^154]

> (f)     At certain intervals, large quantities of cooked turnips would be discharged rapidly in all directions from the exit of the cooking tank, including onto the surrounding floor. The grey troughs on the conveyor located below the cooking tank were unable to hold large amounts of turnips as they were unstable and turned over easily, such that the turnips which fell onto the troughs would consequently fall onto the floor.[^155]

> (g)     When the turnips were transported from the cooking tank to the packaging machine, they would spill over at many locations and would get stuck at various places inside the packaging machine. For example, there would be an overflow of turnips below the conveyor belt with orange cups.[^156] Consequently, by the time the turnips reached the packaging machine, there were barely any turnips left to be packed and the packets would be approximately only one-fifth full or empty.[^157]

> (h)     Some of the empty packets were not opened by the packaging machine before they reached the bottom of the feeder, which was supposed to deliver cooked turnips in fixed quantities. This meant that the cooked turnips which came out of the feeder would fall onto the surface of the packaging machine instead of the empty packets.[^158]

> (i)     The issues described in the preceding subparagraphs and in \[138(c),(d),(f),(g)\] above meant that although the defendant’s employees had fed about 500kg of turnips into the Food Processor during the May 2019 Training, only a few packets of cooked turnips were produced and these packets were filled only with approximately 150g of cooked turnips.[^159]

> (j)     The bucket conveyor at the bottom of the cooking tank was shaky and unstable. When Mr Tan poured water into three of the buckets to simulate the weight of cooked turnips, the buckets started to tilt when they were only half-filled with water. If the buckets were not able to contain water, they would not be able to bear the weight of cooked turnips which fall from the exit of the cooking tank onto the conveyor.[^160]

> (k)     The feeder was not aligned with the orange cups at the bottom of the feeder. Thus, some turnips would not fall into the cups but around the cups instead, leading to some wastage.[^161]

> (l)     There was a gap between the dumping hopper and the metal slide which was supposed to capture any fallen turnips from the upside-down orange cups. Turnips which had not been emptied into the hopper could fall through this gap and onto the floor, leading to further wastage.[^162]

> (collectively, the “Spill and Stuck Issues”)

##### (2)   The plaintiff’s arguments

150    The plaintiff maintained that at the time it delivered the Food Processor to the defendant on 20 December 2018, the Food Processor was working and did not have any defects. Any defects in the Food Processor only arose sometime in May 2019 and were caused by the defendant for the reasons summarised in \[140\] above.[^163]

##### (3)   My findings

151    I accept Mr Aung and Mr Tan’s evidence on the existence and causes of the Spill and Stuck Issues. Their evidence is largely borne out by photographs and/or videos taken during the May 2019 Training and/or Mr Tan’s inspections of the Food Processor.[^164]

152    I am not persuaded that the Spill and Stuck Issues arose only sometime in May 2019 and were caused by the defendant.

153    It is evident from \[149\] above that the Spill and Stuck Issues were caused by flaws in the design and/or construction of the Food Processor. These issues would therefore have existed from the time the Food Processor was manufactured.

154    Furthermore, the plaintiff’s claim that the defendant had caused the Spill and Stuck Issues is wholly unsubstantiated. The plaintiff did not appoint an independent expert to inspect and conduct test runs on the Food Processor, in order to prove its case that the defendant had caused the Spill and Stuck Issues and that but for those issues, the Food Processor could function properly. Moreover, there is no objective evidence that:

> (a)     the defendant had tampered with and altered the Food Processor;

> (b)     the defendant had operated the Food Processor on manual mode instead of auto mode, without following the operation manuals for the Food Processor, and such manner of operation had caused the Spill and Stuck Issues;

> (c)     the defendant had tested the cooking tank of the Food Processor using raw turnips instead of cooked turnips: see \[146(c)\] above for elaboration;

> (d)     the partially cooked nature of the turnips caused them to get stuck in the stirring blade, and around the exit, of the cooking tank;

> (e)     the defendant’s lack of knowledge of the duration required for the peeling, blanching and cooking processes, and the ratio of water to turnips required, had caused the Spill and Stuck Issues;

> (f)     the defendant did not clean the Food Processor after production: see \[146(f)\] above for elaboration;

> (g)     the defendant’s inability to clean the Food Processor completely had caused the Spill and Stuck Issues;

> (h)     the defendant did not perform scheduled preventive maintenance of the Food Processor, and such failure had caused the Spill and Stuck Issues;

> (i)     the defendant had made numerous requests to change the specifications of the Food Processor after confirming the Quotation: see \[146(i)\] above for elaboration.

155    Moreover, most of the Spill and Stuck Issues had occurred during the May 2019 Training. Given that the plaintiff’s representatives had conducted that training, I find it improbable that these issues resulted from any tampering and alteration of, or any failure to properly operate, the Food Processor by the defendant, for the reasons mentioned at \[147\] above.

#### (e)   Whether the production output increased by 500%

156    An aspect of the “Project Impact” on Page 3 of the Proposal is to “Increase Production output by 500%”.[^165]

157    The defendant’s case is that the Food Processor did not increase production output by 500%. The defendant relied on Mr Aung’s evidence of the outcome of the May 2019 Training, namely that the defendant’s employees had fed around 500kg of turnips into the Food Processor, but only a few partially filled packets of cooked turnips were produced, each holding approximately only 150g of cooked turnips.[^166]

158    The plaintiff’s case is that the production output would have increased by 500%, but for the defects in the Food Processor which were caused by the defendant and the following additional causes which were not due to any fault of the plaintiff:[^167]

> (a)     the defendant had inserted, into the peeling machine and the slicing machine, turnips of a bigger size than the specifications which the parties had discussed and agreed upon;

> (b)     the defendant had opened the cover straightaway instead of using the programmed auto mode. This caused the turnips to fall onto the floor as seen in the videos of the May 2019 Training which Mr Loo was referred to in cross examination;

> (c)     the defendant did not know the recipe for cooking turnips and had used raw turnips during the testing of the Food Processor. This caused the turnips to harden akin to stone;

> (d)     as the Food Processor was being built, the defendant had changed the floor plan several times, as a result of which the plaintiff had to make significant amendments to the Food Processor and could not fulfil all the expectations in the Proposal.

159    I accept Mr Aung’s evidence of the outcome of the May 2019 Training. His evidence is entirely consistent with my earlier findings on:

> (a)     the inability of the peeling machine to peel raw turnips completely and to process 300kg of turnips per batch (see \[111\]–\[115\] above);

> (b)     the Partly Automated Issues (see \[141\]–\[148\] above); and

> (c)     the Spill and Stuck Issues (see \[149\] and \[151\]–\[155\] above),

> all of which are defects caused by the plaintiff’s failure to deliver a Food Processor which met the agreed specifications, as opposed to any conduct of the defendant.

160    I do not see any merit in the plaintiff’s alleged additional causes of the Food Processor’s failure to perform as intended.

> (a)     The argument summarised in \[158(a)\] fails in light of my finding in \[118\] above that there were no restrictions on the size of the turnips that could be processed by the Food Processor.

> (b)     In relation to the argument summarised in \[158(b)\], the plaintiff did not specify which cover of the Food Processor it is referring to. Furthermore, it is unclear from the videos of the May 2019 Training shown to Mr Loo during cross examination[^168] whether (i) the defendant had opened any cover of the Food Processor straightaway, and (ii) it was the alleged act of opening the cover straightaway that caused the turnips to fall to the ground.

> (c)     There is no basis for the argument summarised in \[158(c)\]. There is a lack of objective evidence that the defects in the Food Processor were caused by a lack of knowledge on the defendant’s part of the duration required for the peeling, blanching and cooking processors and the ratio of water to turnips required, or the use of raw turnips: see \[146(c)-(e)\], \[147\], \[154(c)-(e)\] and \[155\] above.

> (d)     The argument summarised in \[158(d)\] cannot succeed as there is no objective evidence that the defendant had requested the plaintiff to change the location of the Food Processor and that the Layout Plans were prepared pursuant to such requests: see \[92\] above. Moreover, even if the Layout Plans do show that amendments had to be made to the Food Processor (for which I express no view), there is no evidence that such amendments were a cause of the Food Processor’s inability to increase the defendant’s production output by 500%.

161    In the premises, I find that the Food Processor did not increase the defendant’s production output by 500%. On the contrary, using the Food Processor dramatically decreased the defendant’s production output: it could not even achieve the output that the defendant’s employees could achieve through their manual processing of turnips.

#### (f)   Whether the quality of the processed turnips has improved

162    Page 3 of the Proposal states that the “Project Impact” is to, among other things, “increase the Product quality”.[^169]

163    The defendant’s case is that the Food Processor did not improve the quality of the processed turnips for the following reasons:[^170]

> (a)     Mr Tan had opined that the screw conveyor mixes cooked turnips in a constant and circular motion, and that this will cause some of the cooked turnips to lump together into chunky pieces and become mushy.[^171]

> (b)     The sliced turnips which came out of the slicing machine were mushy and in irregular shapes and sizes instead of consistent slices.[^172]

> (c)     When the defendant’s employees attempted to use a metal spoon to remove the turnips stuck in the stirring blade and around the exit of the cooking tank, the turnips would be flattened and crushed by the metal spoon or the bottom lid of the cooking tank.[^173]

> (d)     Mr Loo had admitted at trial [^174] that one of the videos taken during the May 2019 Training session[^175] showed that the turnips stuck at the exit outlet of the cooking tank were being squashed and squeezed, and that this would affect the quality of the final product.[^176]

164    The plaintiff’s case is that the quality of the processed turnips would have improved, but for the defects in the Food Processor which were caused by the defendant and the additional causes which I have summarised in \[158(a)-(d)\] above.[^177]

165    I accept the defendant’s case that the Food Processor did not improve the quality of the processed turnips:

> (a)     The plaintiff did not adduce any objective evidence to challenge Mr Tan’s views that the screw conveyor mixes cooked turnips in a constant and circular motion, and that this will cause some of the cooked turnips to lump together into chunky pieces and become mushy.[^178] Neither did counsel for the plaintiff challenge these views when he cross examined Mr Tan.

> (b)     It is evident from the photograph in Figure 2 of Mr Aung’s AEIC that the sliced turnips which came out of the slicing machine were mushy and in irregular shapes and sizes.

> (c)     It coheres with logic and common sense that when one attempts to use a metal spoon to remove the turnips stuck in the cooking tank, some of the turnips may, in the process, be flattened and crushed by the metal spoon or the bottom lid of the cooking tank.

> (d)     Based on the video taken during the May 2019 Training session, the turnips stuck at the exit outlet of the cooking tank appear to be squashed and squeezed by the open-and-shut motion of the bottom lid of the tank, due to the constant contact between the lid and the turnips.[^179] I am unable to make any sense of Mr Loo’s explanation at trial that the bottom lid is programmed like a hammer swirling down and therefore does not squash the turnips.[^180] If the bottom lid was indeed programmed like a hammer swirling down, it would stand to reason that the lid would smash into the turnips stuck at the exit outlet of the cooking tank. I also cannot accept Mr Loo’s assertion at trial that the turnips were squashed and squeezed because they were raw, and not cooked, turnips.[^181] Mr Aung had testified that cooked turnips are softer as compared to raw turnips: see \[146(c)\] above. Thus, contrary to Mr Loo’s assertion, it is less likely that raw turnips would be squashed and squeezed since they are harder than cooked turnips.

> (e)     Finally, for the reasons explained in \[160\] above, there is no merit to the alleged additional causes summarised in \[158(a)-(d)\].

166    In the premises, I find that the plaintiff had breached the requirement on page 3 of the Proposal that the product quality would be improved by the Food Processor.

#### (g)   Whether the retort system conforms to pages 1 and 2 of the Retort Specifications

167    The defendant’s case is that the retort system supplied by the plaintiff did not conform to pages 1 and 2 of the Retort Specifications in two aspects:[^182]

> (a)     first, the photograph of the retort system in page 2 of the Retort Specifications shows a single cylinder, whereas the retort system supplied by the plaintiff is made up of two cylinders; and

> (b)     second, page 1 of the Retort Specifications requires the plaintiff to provide a retort system with a capacity of 200kg, but the plaintiff only provided a retort system with a capacity of 70kg.

168    The plaintiff’s case is that the retort system it supplied conforms to the photograph in page 2 of the Retort Specifications, and that it had never promised the capacity output of the retort system which depended on the retort model.[^183]

169    I accept the defendant’s case. It is undisputed that the retort system had to conform with the photograph at page 2 of the Retort Specifications. Page 2 shows a retort system made up of a single cylinder.[^184] On the other hand, the retort system supplied by the plaintiff comprises of two cylinders, one stacked on top of the other, as seen from the unchallenged photograph in Figure 28 of Mr Tan’s expert report. Thus, the retort system supplied by the plaintiff evidently did not conform to page 2 of the Retort Specifications.

170    Furthermore, the plaintiff had promised that the capacity output of the retort system would be approximately 200kg per batch as that is clearly stated in page 1 of the Retort Specification.[^185] This capacity requirement is not met in light of Mr Tan’s unchallenged evidence that the retort system supplied by the plaintiff only had a capacity of 70kg.[^186]

171    In the premises, I find that the retort system supplied by the plaintiff did not conforms to pages 1 and 2 of the Retort Specifications.

#### (h)   Whether any handover list was delivered to and signed by the defendant

172    The defendant’s case is that the plaintiff did not deliver to the defendant any handover list setting out the equipment which it had handed over to the defendant. Mr Loo himself admitted at trial that there was no handover list signed by Ms Li.[^187]

173    The plaintiff’s case is that the defendant’s former production supervisor, one Mr Ziao Tan had signed the equipment list. However, Mr Ziao Tan had left the defendant’s employ in or around January 2019.[^188]

174    I find that no handover list was delivered to and signed by the defendant. It is undisputed that Ms Li did not sign any handover list at the time the plaintiff handed over the Food Processor to the defendant.[^189] I am not satisfied that Mr Ziao Tan had signed the handover list on behalf of the defendant as no such list was in evidence before me, and the plaintiff did not call Mr Ziao Tan as a witness to corroborate its case that he had signed the handover list.

### Issue 8: Whether the plaintiff provided adequate site support to the defendant to enable its employees to operate the Food Processor

175    It is undisputed that the plaintiff was obliged to provide the defendant with three days of site support, and that such site support had to be sufficient so as to enable the defendant’s employees to operate the Food Processor smoothly.[^190] For convenience, I will refer to this obligation as the obligation to provide adequate site support.

176    The defendant submitted that this obligation was breached as the plaintiff did not provide any proper instruction or support on how to operate the Food Processor. In this regard, the defendant relied primarily on Mr Aung’s evidence in his AEIC that:[^191]

> (a)     The plaintiff had attempted to teach the defendant’s employees how to operate the Food Processor on three separate occasions in 2019. Mr Aung was present on the first and last training sessions which occurred in early 2019 and late May 2019 respectively.

> (b)     At the time of the first training session, the components of the Food Processor had not been linked up and the retort system was also not ready. Mr Loo and his brother wanted to teach the defendant’s employees how to use the individual components of the Food Processor which had been delivered to the defendant’s factory. However, they ended up spending most of the time checking the components, fixing problems with the components and figuring out how to operate the components, instead of training the defendant’s employees. Furthermore, any instructions given by Mr Loo and his brother on how to operate the components were purely verbal. This was a problem since the training was not conducted in a structured manner. At the end of the session, Mr Loo told the defendant’s employees that he would return on another day to fix the problems with the Food Processor.

> (c)     While Mr Aung was not present at the second training session, he believed that the plaintiff continued to encounter problems with the Food Processor and that not much progress was made during that session, because there were still many problems with the Food Processor during the subsequent May 2019 Training.

> (d)     During the last training session (_ie_, the May 2019 Training), Mr Loo and his brother spent most of the time fixing problems with the Food Processor and were therefore unable to provide any proper training to the defendant’s employees. Moreover, any instructions they gave on the operation of the Food Processor were verbal instructions, which were difficult to follow.

177    The plaintiff denied that it had breached the obligation to provide adequate site support. The plaintiff’s case is that on 20 December 2018, the Food Processor was completed and delivered to the defendant. Thereafter, the plaintiff provided adequate training to the defendant’s employees in December 2018 and May 2019. Moreover, the plaintiff had provided the operation manual for the Food Processor to the defendant via email on 29 January 2019. However, the defendant’s employees were unable to learn how to operate the Food Processor due to the frequent change of employees, the absence of proper handover procedures within the defendant company, and the fact that the employees were not interested in learning and/or did not attend the training sessions.[^192]

178    I accept Mr Aung’s evidence that the plaintiff had held a total of three training sessions on how to operate the Food Processor: the first session in early 2019, the second session sometime thereafter, and the final session in May 2019. The first session is evidenced by the plaintiff’s Turnip Automation System Training Guidelines for a training session at the defendant’s factory on 22 to 24 January 2019, which was signed by a few employees of the defendant, including Mr Aung.[^193] It is not disputed that the last session is the May 2019 Training. There is no objective evidence, such as a training attendance sheet, to show that the plaintiff had conducted any training for the defendant’s employees prior to January 2019.

179    I find that the plaintiff had breached its obligation to provide adequate site support for the following reasons.

> (a)     The email correspondence between the parties shows that as of mid-May 2019, the components of the Food Processor still had not been linked to form an automatic production line. By way of emails on 25 April 2019 and 8 and 13 May 2019, the defendant’s Dawn Chew (“Ms Chew”) informed Mr Loo that the components of the Food Processor had not been connected together and requested him to connect them.[^194] On 15 May 2019, in reply to Ms Chew’s email of 13 May 2019, Mr Loo stated, among other things, that the plaintiff would “start the cable connection on 16/05/2019 And also … start the linking up to the New cooking tank”, and that “upon completion, \[the plaintiff\] will provide a 1 day training. (FOC) after which it will be chargeable”.[^195]

> (b)     Given that the components of the Food Processor had not been linked to form an automatic production line as of mid-May 2019, any training provided during the first and second training sessions would have been incomplete because it would not have covered how to run the Food Processor from start to end. At best, the training would only touch on how to operate the individual components of the Food Processor.

> (c)     Furthermore, it is evident from my findings on Issue 7(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) that the Food Processor could not even function properly. Turnips would become stuck in various parts of the Food Processor, and a substantial amount of turnips would be spilled onto the floor of the defendant’s factory, in the course of being processed. The Food Processor was also not fully automated, as a result of which the defendant’s employees had to step in to manually perform some of the tasks involved in the processing of turnips. In these circumstances, it is inconceivable that the plaintiff could have conducted any proper training during the three training sessions on how to operate the Food Processor. I accept Mr Aung’s evidence that the plaintiff’s representatives had spent most of the training sessions attempting, unsuccessfully, to fix problems with the Food Processor and to get the Food Processor to function properly.

> (d)     To exacerbate the situation, the plaintiff did not provide the defendant with the full set of operation or instruction manuals for the entire Food Processor. The objective evidence shows that Mr Loo had only emailed the defendant (i) an operation manual for the weigher on 29 January 2019,[^196] and (ii) an instruction manual on the elevator, the peeling machine and the slicing machine on 6 May 2019.[^197]

180    In light of my finding that no proper training was provided by the plaintiff on how to operate the Food Processor, it is not necessary for me to determine whether there was a high staff turnover and the absence of proper handover procedures within the defendant company, and whether the defendant’s employees were uninterested in learning how to operate the Food Processor and/or did not attend the training sessions. Even if these matters were true, I am of the view that they do not detract from the plaintiff’s breach of its obligation to provide adequate site support.

### Issues 9 and 10: Whether the Food Processor was of satisfactory quality and reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal

181    It is not disputed that pursuant to sections 14(2)–(3) of the SOGA, it is an implied term of the Turnip System Agreement that the Food Processor had to be of satisfactory quality and reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal.[^198]

#### The defendant’s arguments

182    The defendant’s case is that the Food Processor was not of satisfactory quality, or reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal. In this regard, the defendant reiterated its arguments for Issue 7. The defendant also relied on the following additional issues which Mr Tan had identified with the Food Processor:[^199]

> (a)     the metering auger feeding system is not able to produce a fixed amount of turnips for each packet of turnips;

> (b)     the installation of the chiller unit is inappropriate as there is no ducting elbow to direct hot air out of the factory. If hot air accumulates, the pressure increases and may cause the pipe supplying freon gas (which is poisonous) to burst and leak;

> (c)     the electrical wiring of the Food Processor is hazardous as they are tangled and exposed without any trunking or cable grain to prevent water or dust from entering the electrical wires;

> (d)     workmanship and welding at various parts of the Food Processor are of poor quality. A consequence of this is that water and inserts can enter the electrical boxes of the Food Processor through various gaps and holes in the boxes, thus posing an electrical hazard and hygiene risk;

> (e)     the different pipes installed as part of the Food Processor are not labelled, and it is not possible to identify which pipes are connected to which parts of the Food Processor. This makes it difficult to identify the proper pipes during any maintenance and repairs would be difficult and increases the risk of a person maintaining and repairing the wrong pipe. Moreover, the pipes were not labelled with instructions on the side to inform the operator of what to do in the event of an emergency; and

> (f)     the following safety hazards make the Food Processor unsafe for use:

>> (i)       the safety lock on the elevator which transports raw unpeeled turnips from a metal container to the peeling machine is not sufficient. There should be an additional safety lock pin to ensure that the lock stays in place. Without the safety lock pin, the safety lock can be dislodged easily, causing 100kg to 200kg of turnips to be toppled onto anyone standing at the bottom of the elevator;

>> (ii)       the cooking tank is not certified by a professional engineer. Hence it is unclear if the cooking tank is safe for use;

>> (iii)       the compressed air tube located at the bottom of the cooking tank is unable to withstand high heat as it is made of polyurethane. However, it is located right beside the cooking tank which can rise to high temperatures. This increases the risk of the compressed air tube bursting. Given that there is no mechanical safety lock on the lid at the outlet of the cooking tank, in the event the compressed air tube bursts, the lid will be forced open. Hot water and cooked turnips will then gush out from the cooking tank onto the surrounding area, scalding anyone nearby;

>> (iv)       there are no certificates to prove that the components of the Food Processor (apart from the boiler) are made of food-grade material; and

>> (v)       some parts of the Food Processor are not made of stainless steel and have started to rust.

> (collectively, the “Further Issues”)

#### The plaintiff’s arguments

183    The plaintiff denied that the Food Processor was not of satisfactory quality, or reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal.

184    In relation to fitness for purpose, the plaintiff argued that this issue was not pleaded by the defendant.[^200] In any event, the Food Processor was reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal, and any defects in the Food Processor (including the matters summarised in \[158\] above) were caused by the defendant.[^201]

185    On the issue of satisfactory quality, the plaintiff submitted that:[^202]

> (a)     The Food Processor is a unique customised good, and the plaintiff had no prior experience with food processors that which process only turnips. Thus, it would not be equitable to evaluate the Food Processor on its fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied.

> (b)     It is the defendant’s failure to clean the Food Processor which led to the issues with the appearance and finish of the Food Processor.

> (c)     The Food Processor did not have any defects when it was delivered to the defendant in December 2018. In or after May 2019, the Food Processor may have suffered from minor defects, but such defects (if any) were caused by the defendant. In any event, where the defects are so minor that they do not affect the reliability or safety of the Food Processor, the Court should hold that such defects do not render the Food Processor of unsatisfactory quality.

> (d)     The plaintiff had obtained all safety certifications required by the MOM for the cooking tank, the boiler, the retort system, the hot water tank and the air receiver, by 24 January 2019.

#### My findings

186    I first address the issue of fitness for purpose.

187    While the defendant did not plead that the Food Processor was not reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal, I find that the defendant should not be precluded from raising the argument as the plaintiff was not taken by surprise or irreparably prejudiced by the defendant’s failure to plead the same. The parties had agreed, in their Agreed List of Issues (Amendment No. 1) dated 27 July 2021, that one of the issues to be determined in this Suit is whether the Food Processor was reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal. Furthermore, the defendant is relying on the same set of facts to support both its pleaded argument that the Food Processor was not of satisfactory quality and its unpleaded argument that the Food Processor was not reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal. It is not the plaintiff’s position that it did not have a reasonable opportunity to respond to those facts.

188    The purposes stated in the Proposal included a fully automated Food Processor which would increase the defendant’s production output by 500% and improve the quality of the processed turnips: see \[121\]–\[123\], \[156\] and \[162\] above. In my judgment, my findings on Issue 7 alone show that the Food Processor was not reasonably fit for such purposes.

189    In any event, I accept that there are Further Issues with the Food Processor for the following reasons.

> (a)     Mr Tan had cogently explained that the issue set out in \[182(a)\] above arises because the metering auger feeding system operates on a timer-based system which cannot produce accurate and fixed amounts of turnips in each batch. A volumetric weighing system would have been more suitable.[^203]

> (b)     The issues described in \[182(b)-(e)\] and \[182(f)(i),(iii),(v)\] above are clearly depicted in various photographs in Mr Tan’s expert report.[^204] Moreover, Mr Tan’s explanation of the safety hazards set out in \[182(f)(i),(iii)\] is sound.

> (c)     The plaintiff did not disclose any document to show that the cooking tank is certified by a professional engineer. The only certificate issued by a professional engineer, which the plaintiff has adduced, is the Boiler Inspection Certificate.[^205] It is Mr Tan’s unchallenged evidence that the said certificate pertains only to the boiler.[^206]

> (d)     There is no documentary evidence to suggest that apart from the boiler, the other components of the Food Processor are made of food-grade material.

> (e)     The plaintiff has not adduced any objective evidence to refute the existence of the Further Issues, or to show that they were caused by the defendant. The plaintiff also did not cross examine Mr Tan on the Further Issues, except for his view that the cooking tank had not been certified by a professional engineer. Thus, Mr Tan’s evidence on the Further Issues stands largely unchallenged.

190    The safety hazards and hygiene risks posed by the Further Issues provide additional support for my view that the Food Processor was not reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal.

191    Moving on to the issue of satisfactory quality, section 14(2A) of the SOGA provides that goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances. Under section 14(2B), the quality of goods includes their state and condition, and that the following are (in appropriate cases) aspects of the quality of goods:

> (_a_)     _fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kind in question are commonly supplied;_

> (b)    appearance and finish;

> (c)    freedom from minor defects;

> (_d_)     _safety_; and

> (e)    durability.

> \[emphasis added\]

192    In light of my earlier findings that the Food Processor was not reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal and posed several safety hazards and hygiene risks, I do not think a reasonable person would regard the Food Processor as having met the satisfactory standard required under section 14(2A) of the SOGA. The Food Processor was therefore not of satisfactory quality.

193    I do not accept the plaintiff’s argument that the defects in the Food Processor are so minor that they do not affect the reliability or safety of the Food Processor. The plaintiff is not entitled to raise this argument: it is not part of the plaintiff’s pleaded case and was first raised in its closing submissions, thus giving the defendant no reasonable opportunity to respond. Moreover, this argument is no more than an unsubstantiated submission from the bar. The plaintiff’s witnesses did not give any evidence on whether the defects in the Food Processor are so minor that they do not affect the reliability or safety of the Food Processor.

194    Accordingly, I find that the Food Processor was not of satisfactory quality or reasonably fit for the purposes stated in the Proposal.

### Issue 11: Whether the defendant is entitled to a refund of S$976,054.00 it had paid for the Food Processor and damages of S$193,190.00

#### The defendant’s arguments

195    The defendant submitted that the Food Processor is defective and the defendant had rejected it on numerous occasions. The present case is therefore effectively one of non-delivery, for which the applicable measure of damages under section 51(2) of the SOGA is “the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach of contract”. Since the defendant did not receive any value for the Food Processor, the defendant is entitled to a refund of the purchase price of S$976,054.00 which it had paid for the Food Processor.[^207]

196    The defendant also claimed that as a result of the plaintiff’s supply of a defective Food Processor, the defendant had to engage third parties to carry out the sterilisation of cooked turnips, which should have been carried out using the retort system. The defendant is entitled to recover the costs of S$193,190.00 which it had incurred from March 2020 to August 2020 to engage these third parties.[^208]

#### The plaintiff’s arguments

197    The plaintiff submitted that even if the Court finds that the Food Processor is defective, the defendant had accepted the Food Processor by: (a) keeping silent for a period of eight months after December 2018 (_ie_, when the Food Processor was first delivered and completed) before taking issue with the Food Processor by issuing the plaintiff a letter of demand through its former solicitors, and (b) paying the outstanding balance of S$142,695.20 due in relation to the Food Processor sometime in March 2020.[^209]

#### My findings

##### (1)   The defendant had rejected the Food Processor

198    A key issue raised by the parties’ arguments is whether the defendant had rejected the Food Processor, or had in fact accepted the Food Processor by reason of its alleged silence and its payment of the outstanding balance of S$142,695.20. In my judgment, the defendant had rejected the Food Processor.

199    The WhatsApp messages and email correspondence exchanged between the parties’ representatives from late October 2018 to January 2020 show that:[^210]

> (a)     from the time that components of the Food Processor were first delivered to the defendant in or around October 2018, the defendant had repeatedly complained to the plaintiff about various defects in the Food Processor – including the fact that the Food Processor was not fully automated – and requested the plaintiff to rectify the defects;

> (b)     however, the plaintiff had, for the most part, denied the existence of any defects and/or pushed the blame for the alleged defects onto the defendant, and failed to successfully rectify the defects.

200    In particular, in an email from the defendant’s Ms Chew to Mr Loo on 11 June 2019, she expressly stated that the defendant was unable to accept the Food Processor insofar it was not fully automated:[^211]

> On 30/05/2019, you only verbally instructed us on “which button to execute”. There is no full / thorough run of the machines.

> We greatly appreciate if you could run the machine from beginning till the end without any failure / interruption.

> We will schedule the time for you to test the machine again. _We are unable to accept if our production workers need to operate some process manually._

> \[emphasis added\]

201    Even when the defendant paid the plaintiff the outstanding balance of S$142,695.20 for the Food Processor, the defendant had done so under protest, maintaining that the plaintiff was not entitled to the payment in light of the fact that the Food Processor remained non-functional and defective and the plaintiff had refused the defendant’s requests to make right the Food Processor. This is evident from the letter issued by the defendant’s solicitors to the plaintiff’s solicitors on 11 March 2020, which was around the same time that payment of the outstanding balance was made. The material portions of the letter are reproduced below:[^212]

> “2.    We see no need to reiterate the matters which have been the subject of previous correspondence. But it suffices to state that:-

>> (a)     _to date, the equipment that you have provided to our client remains non-functional and defective_;

>> (b)    our client strenuously rejects your client’s claim that the equipment that had been supplied met the specifications provided by our client. Our client also strenuously rejects your client’s claim that our client had “made several unreasonable demands … to vary the specifications”; and

>> (c)     _your client has repeatedly rejected our client’s suggestion for a joint inspection of the equipment and our client’s requests that your client make right the non-functional and defective equipment_.

> …

> 5.    Our client is not prepared to let the matter drag on any further. We are instructed that:-

>> (a)     _our client has already arranged for the sum of $142,695.20 to be transferred to your client, under protest, as payment of the outstanding amount for the equipment less your client’s credit note._ For the avoidance of doubt, our client’s position remains that _your client is not entitled to payment of such sum in light of the matters raised previously and above_;

>> (b)     _our client expects all defects and issues in relation to the equipment to be resolved to their satisfaction by 18 March 2020, failing which we have firm instructions to commence proceedings. For the avoidance of doubt, our client reserves the right, in such proceedings, to seek relief in the form of (but not limited to) repayment of the sum referred to at paragraph 5(a) above._

> \[emphasis added\]

202    By its conduct as described above, the defendant had clearly intimated to the plaintiff that it would reject the Food Processor insofar as the defects remained unrectified (which was the case here).

##### (2)   The appropriate quantum of damages

203    It is well settled that if the breaches of contract deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended to obtain from the contract, the innocent party is entitled to terminate the contract: see _Sports Connection_ at \[24\].[^213] In sale of goods cases, the Courts have recognised that an innocent party may elect to terminate the contract by informing the vendor that it is rejecting the goods: see James Edelman, _McGregor on Damages_ (Sweet & Maxwell, 21st edition, 2021) (“_McGregor on Damages_”) at \[12-027\] and \[12-034\].

204    Where the goods have been lawfully rejected, the case becomes in effect one of non-delivery. Hence the measure of damages for non-delivery set out in section 51(2) of the SOGA applies – _ie_, the buyer is entitled to compensation for losses directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the seller’s breach – with one addition. That is, the buyer is also entitled to recover expenses which stem from the receipt of the defective goods: see _Super Continental_ at \[132\].[^214]

205    Applying the aforesaid legal principles, the Singapore High Court held in _Super Continental_ at \[132\] that the buyer was entitled to be refunded all sums it had paid for a UHT plant because it had received no value for that price since the machine was defective.

206    Turning to the present case, in light of my findings on Issues 7 to 10, I am satisfied that the plaintiff’s breaches of the Turnip System Agreement have deprived the defendant of substantially the whole benefit which it was intended to obtain from the agreement, namely a fully automated system for the processing of turnips which met the “Project Objectives” and “Project Impact” stated in the Proposal. In the premises, the defendant is entitled to a refund of all amounts it had paid for the Food Processor, which total S$962,957.20. This figure is derived by deducting from the purchase price of S$976,054.00, the sum of S$13,096.80 which the plaintiff discounted from the purchase price in its credit note to the defendant dated 3 May 2019.[^215]

207    Furthermore, I find that the defendant is entitled to the costs of S$193,190.00 which it had incurred to engage third parties to carry out the sterilisation of cooked turnips. Such costs flow directly from the plaintiff’s breaches of the Turnip System Agreement, namely its failure to provide a retort system which conformed to pages 1 and 2 of the Retort Specifications and to provide proper training to the defendant’s employees on how to operate the Food Processor. The defendant has disclosed copies of its accounting ledgers showing that it had incurred retort fees totalling S$193,190.00 to engage third parties to sterilise cooked turnips,[^216] and the plaintiff did not challenge the quantum of such fees.

## Conclusion

208    For the forgoing reasons, I award:

> (a)     judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of S$2,726.36 (being the invoiced amount for the accessories to the Trolleys) and interest on the said sum at the rate of 5.33% p.a. from the date of the Writ to the date of this judgment; and

> (b)     judgment to the defendant in the sum of S$1,156,147.20 (being the total sum it had paid for the Food Processor) and interest on the said sum at the rate of 5.33% p.a. from the date of the Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) to the date of this judgment.

209    Costs and disbursements are to be agreed between the parties, or failing agreement, to be fixed by me.
