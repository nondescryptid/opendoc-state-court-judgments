## Antecedents

5       On 14 Jan 2019, the Accused was convicted for the offence of unauthorized drug possession and was sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment. He was also convicted for the offence of possession of utensils for drug consumption and was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment. Both the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. He was also detained at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for 12 months in 2017. In 2018, he was placed on a 24 months’ drug supervision.

## Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

6       The Prosecution submitted for a total jail term of 6 years 3 months and 62 days.

## Mitigation

7       Counsel tendered a written mitigation on behalf of the Accused. Counsel submitted that the circumstances leading to the commission of the offences were due to the stress faced by the Accused as at that time, he was facing a charge of supporting terrorism that might have an effect on his family members.

8       The mitigating factors highlighted by counsel was that the Accused had pleaded guilty and was remorseful.

9       Counsel also contended that the Accused was an addict and not a true criminal. It was submitted that a global imprisonment sentence of 3 years 3 months to 3 years 5 months would be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

## Sentencing Considerations

10     Given the nature of the offences committed and the circumstances of the case, I was of the view that the primary sentencing consideration must be one of both general and specific deterrence.

11     In determining the appropriate sentence, I also took into account the various prescribed punishments provided for the offences committed by the Accused.

12     I gave credit to the Accused for his plea of guilt and his remorsefulness.

13     With respect, the tremendous stress faced by the Accused was of little or no mitigating value.

14     The Accused was not a first-time offender. I noted that the Accused committed the offences very soon after his conviction and imprisonment in 2019. He clearly has to be specifically deterred from re-offending.

15     It was also noted that the Accused had re-offended while on bail.

16     Another aggravating factor was the number of charges admitted and consented by the Accused to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

17     It was also stated in the SOF that the Accused had failed to report for his urine tests on 49 occasions.

## The Individual Sentences

18     Having considered the nature of the offences, the circumstances and the submissions of the parties, I sentenced the Accused to an imprisonment term of 3 years which was the minimum mandated imprisonment and an enhanced sentence of 62 days in respect of the drug consumption charge (DAC917917/2019).

19     In respect of the enhanced sentence of 62 days imposed for the breach of the remission order made pursuant to the Prisons Act, I took into account the fact that the present offence committed by the Accused was drug related as the offence for which he was subjected to the remission order. From 4 June 2019 to 13 August 2019, the Accused was subjected to the remission order. I noted that he reoffended on 13 June 2019 which was very soon after he was released on a remission order. It was therefore necessary to impose the remaining duration of the remission order of 62 days’ imprisonment.

20     Taking into account the sentencing considerations stated above, the Accused was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 2 years 6 months for the drug possession charge (DAC 932565/2019). An uplift from the minimum prescribed sentence was warranted particularly because it was committed while he was on bail and after he had been charged in court for another offence.

21     The Accused was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment for each of the failure to report for urine test charges (DAC 932567/2019 and DAC 932570/2019). This was within the normal range of sentences imposed for such offences. It was also noted that the Accused had failed to report for his urine tests on 49 occasions.

22     In respect of the charge numbered as DAC 900738/2020, the Accused was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment. An uplift was necessary as he was recently jailed 3 months for the same offence in January 2019.

## Conclusion

23     The sentences in DAC917917/2019, DAC932565/2019, DAC932567/2019 and DAC900738/2020 were ordered to run consecutively. These were all distinct offences. There was an absence of proximity between the offences.

24     The global sentence would serve as a deterrent and give sufficient weight to the need for specific deterrence.

25     In my view, considering the various sentencing considerations above, the global sentence was not substantially higher than the normal range of sentences in cases of repeat drug consumption. I noted that the global sentence imposed was nowhere near the maximum imprisonment prescribed for a repeat drug consumption offender. It was also not crushing taking into account the Accused’s past record and his future prospects.

26     The Accused is currently serving his sentence.
