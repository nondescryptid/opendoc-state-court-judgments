Criminal Law – Offences – Voluntarily Causing Hurt

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Road Rage

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9166/2022/01.\]

5 October 2022

### District Judge James Elisha Lee:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Mr Muhammad Azmi Bin Selamat, a 31-year-old Singaporean, pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap.24, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”). He also consented to having 2 charges, namely MCN-900406-2020 and MCN-900408-2020 of using criminal force under s 352 of the Penal Code taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

2       The prescribed punishment for the offence under s 323 of the Penal Code was imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000/, or with both.

3       The Accused was sentenced to **1 weeks' imprisonment**. The Accused being dissatisfied filed an appeal against his sentence. He is on bail pending appeal.

4       These are the grounds for the sentence imposed.

**The Charge**

5       The proceeded charge read as follows:

> **MCN-900407-2020**

> You … are charged that you, on 1 December 2019, at about 6.45pm, at the junction of Stevens Road and Balmoral Road, in the direction of Orchard Road, did voluntarily cause hurt to Kaantan A/L Maruthai (m/36 years old) (“the victim”), to wit, by using both your hands to pull the victim forcefully from his motorcycle which resulted in him falling to the ground, intending thereby to cause hurt to the victim, and thereby causing him to suffer a sprain / contusion of his left wrist, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Statement of Facts

6       The Statement of Facts which the Accused admitted without qualification are as follows.

> **Accused**

> 1    The accused is Muhammad Azmi Bin Selamat, a 31-year-old male Singaporean (D.O.B: 17 March 1991). At the material time, he was the driver of the motor car bearing registration no. SLF2079L.

> **Victim**

> 2    The victim is Kaantan A/L Maruthai, a 36-year-old male Malaysian. At the material time, he was the rider of the motorcycle bearing registration no. JMD4941.

> **Witness**

> 3    The witness is Robert James Bamford, a 37-year-old male British national. At the material time, he was a pedestrian.

> **First Information Report**

> 4    On 2 December 2019 at about 11.58am, the victim lodged a police report stating that on 1 December 2019 at about 6.45pm, he was physically assaulted by the driver of motorcar SLF2079L. The incident location was reported as along Stevens Road, near Mercure Hotel, Singapore.

> **Investigation Findings**

> 5    On 1 December 2019 at about 6.45pm, the victim was riding his motorcycle along the leftmost lane of Stevens Road towards Orchard Road, near Mercure Hotel. The accused was driving motorcar SLF2079L behind the victim. The accused wanted to overtake him and he horned at the victim. The victim moved to the right side of the left-most lane to allow the accused to overtake. As the accused drove past the victim, he raised his right hand and gestured angrily at the victim.

> 6    Soon after, the accused and the victim approached a red traffic light at the junction of Stevens Road and Balmoral Road, in the direction of Orchard Road. The victim was riding along the right side of the left-most lane of Stevens Road, while the accused was driving on the leftmost lane of the same road. They both slowed down and were side by side. However, when the accused’s motor car was slowing down, he moved towards the right of the left-most lane. The victim thus found himself in between the accused’s motor car and the adjacent car on his right side.

> 7    The victim thus tried to squeeze through the space between the two motor cars and accidentally came into contact with the right-side window of the accused’s motor car. The victim then stopped his motorcycle in the centre lane ahead of the accused’s motor car.

> 8    The accused was upset that the victim had come into contact with his front-right window of the accused’s motor car.

> 9    While waiting for the traffic light to turn green, the accused alighted from his motor car and confronted the victim. The accused then asked the victim why he had come into contact with his front-right window. During the confrontation, the accused used criminal force on the victim in the manner set out in the 1st charge (MCN-900406-2020). The accused used both hands to grab the victim’s raincoat and pulled the victim forcefully from his motorcycle. As a result, the victim fell to the ground and landed on his left wrist. The victim’s motorcycle fell to the ground and landed on the victim’s leg.

> 10    At the material time, the witness was walking along Stevens Road and witnessed the incident. The witness intervened and told the accused to calm down. However, the accused again asked the victim why he had come into contact with his front-right window. Thereafter, the accused used criminal force on the victim in the manner set out in the 3rd charge (MCN-900408-2020). The victim’s face was not covered at this point as his visor was up.

> 11    The accused subsequently returned to his motor car, while the witness helped the victim pick up his motorcycle and move it to the side of the road. The accused then drove off and left the scene.

> 12    On 2 December 2019, the victim visited Twin City Medical Centre for his injuries. On examination, he was found to have a sprain / contusion of his left wrist. He was treated with medication and given two days of medical leave.

> **Conclusion**

> 13    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had voluntarily caused hurt to the victim. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 14    The accused admits to the above offence and stands charged accordingly.

## Antecedents

7       The Accused is untraced.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

8       The Prosecution submitted that this was a classic case of road rage for which deterrence is the predominant sentencing consideration and a **short custodial term** would be appropriate in this case.

9       It was the Prosecution’s position that the facts of the present case fell squarely within the definition of road rage as set out in the case of _PP v Lim Yee Hua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1106</span> at \[21\] where the High Court held,

> “… an incident of violence should be labelled as an episode of road rage violence only where the facts disclose violence perpetrated by road users as a result of real or perceived slights by other road users stemming from differences that arise in the course of the shared use of our roads …”

10     In the present case, the victim’s manner of driving and the contact with the front-right window of the Accused’s vehicle, and the Accused’s perceived slight by the victim, was the cause of the Accused’s unhappiness which then resulted in the Accused’s acts of violence.

11     The Prosecution then followed the 2-step inquiry approach for offences under s 323 of the Penal Code in _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> at \[78\]:

> (a)     First, identify the sentencing band and where the particular case falls within the applicable indicative sentencing range, by considering the hurt caused by the offence, to derive the appropriate indicative starting point.

> (b)     Second, make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point, based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors.

12     Based on the sentencing bands for a first-time offender who pleads guilty as set out in _Low Song Chye’s_ case at \[77\], the Prosecution submits that this case falls within “Band 1” with an indicative sentencing range of fines or up to four weeks’ imprisonment in view of the minor injuries sustained by the victim.

13     In terms of the necessary adjustment to the indicative starting point to be made, the Prosecution submitted that it was well established that the primary sentencing consideration for offences involving road rage violence is deterrence, both general and specific, given the strong public interest in protecting road users from violence arising from traffic-related skirmishes. In such cases, the Prosecution submited, the custodial threshold would invariably be crossed. The Prosecution cited the cases of _Ong Hwee Leong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 458</span>, _PP v Lee Seck Hing_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 2 SLR(R) 374</span> and _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> in support.

14     The Prosecution also highlighted the following aspects regarding the Accused’s culpability:

> (a)     the Accused was the aggressor, having alighted from his vehicle and approached the Victim to demand for an explanation as to why the Victim had come into contact with the front right window of his car.

> (b)     before the Victim could proffer explanation, the Accused pulled the Victim forcefully from his motorcycle, causing the Victim to fall to the ground.

> (c)     prior this act, the Accused had hit the Victim’s helmet with his palm (subject matter of the charge in MCN-900406-2020 which was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing). After this act, the Accused used both his palms to push the Victim’s face (subject matter of the charge: MCN-900408-2020 which was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing).

15     The Prosecution next referred to the following 3 precedent cases whereby custodial sentences had been meted out even where the victims suffered only minor injuries:

> (a)     In _PP v Tan Zhenyang_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 209</span>, the offender pleaded guilty to one charge under s 323 of the Penal Code involving a parking dispute where the victim made an unauthorised right turn to reach the parking lot before the offender. The offender told him that he saw the lot first, but the victim refused to give it up. The victim told the offender to move by placing the back of his hand below the offender’s chest. This angered the offender who then pulled the victim towards him, punched the victim’s face, hit the victim repeatedly, grabbed the victim’s left arm as he was trying to escape. He also grabbed the victim’s neck and shoved him onto a nearby car causing a dent to the car and slapped the victim multiple times and also headlocked him. The victim only suffered two scratch marks and mild bruising on face and left elbow abrasion. Chan J increased the sentence from $5,000 to 5 weeks’ imprisonment finding that “the provocation by the victim if any was slight, and the nature of the assault was severe notwithstanding the relatively minor injuries”.

> (b)     In _PP v Tan Chai Yong_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 51</span>, both the offender and victim had been riding their respective motorcycles along the East Coast Parkway. The victim’s girlfriend was riding pillion on his motorcycle. It was undisputed that after the victim’s water bottle dropped from his motorcycle, parties pulled over to the road shoulder and dismounted. At the road shoulder, there was a confrontation between the offender and the victim. The offender slapped the victim, causing the victim to suffer bodily pain. The offender claimed trial to a single charge under s 323 of the Penal Code. He was convicted and was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment.

> (c)     In _PP v Leong Ban Fatt_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 74</span>, the offender and victim got into an altercation over the offender’s conduct of executing an illegal U-turn at the junction of Balestier Road and Thomson Road. During the altercation, the offender swung his hand and hit the victim once on his lower lip, causing the victim to sustain a lower lip abrasion wound. Thereafter, the offender exchanged words with the victim before leaving the scene. The offender claimed trial to a charge under s 323 of the Penal Cde. He was convicted and sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment as the lower court found that while the level of harm caused was low, the offender’s aggression and persistence in confronting the victim repeatedly had placed his culpability at the medium level. The sentence was upheld by the High Court.

## Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

16     The Defence submitted for **a high fine** to be imposed or in the event the court was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed, an imprisonment term of **no more than 3 days**.

17     The Defence’s position was that the present case was not one involving road rage violence on the part of the Accused. The Defence cited the case of _Lim Yee Hua_ where the High Court had found, on the facts, that it was the victim who was the road rage aggressor for hitting the accused’s car and was the initial perpetrator. The Defence submitted that there were significant factual similarities between _Lim Yee Hua_ and the present case in that it was also the victim who first came into contact with the Accused’s front-right window. The Accused’s subsequent conduct had arisen out of the victim’s act. Accordingly, it was the victim and not the Accused who was the “initial aggressor”. The Defence submitted, therefore that the deterrent sentencing policy against road rage should not apply.

18     The Defence further highlighted the following mitigating factors:

> (a)     The injuries sustained by the victim were minor;

> (b)     No weapons were used, and the duration of the assault was not long. There was also no premeditation as the Accused had acted out of a loss of temper and control over his emotions. The offence was a one-off incident which had occurred as a result the Accused’s lapse and error of judgment;

> (c)     The Accused had no prior record of violence and was a first-time offender. He had pleaded guilty and is immensely remorseful.

19     The Defence also pointed out that in _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case, the High Court had taken the view that it should not invariably be the case that a custodial term must be imposed for all offences involving road rage violence and that all the relevant circumstances of the case must still be considered in order to mete out a fair and appropriate sentence.

20     The Defence referred to the following 2 precedent cases whereby non-custodial sentences had been meted out:

> (a)     In _PP v Ng Yong Ngee_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGMC 6</span>, the offence was committed after an encounter on the road between the accused and the victim. The accused was approaching the junction at a slow speed due to traffic conditions. The victim came alongside the left side of his car. The accused wanted to get into the slip road to turn into Clementi Road and sped up to get ahead of the bicycle and started turning left. In doing so, the accused’s car almost caused a sideswipe with the victim’s bicycle. After the car had overtaken the bicycle and stopped behind another car before the zebra crossing of the slip road, the victim used her hand to hit the car from behind. After hearing the victim hit his car, the accused sounded his car horn at the victim a few times. In return the victim turned back and gestured at the accused. He then got out of his car and approached the victim from behind. The accused used his right hand to slap the head of the victim, walked back to his car and drove off. He pleaded guilty to 1 charge under s 323 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to a fine of $3,000.

> (b)     In _PP v Muhammad Azahar Bin Abdul Malik_ (MCN 901566/2021, unreported) the accused had stopped in front of the bus at the bus stop, boarded the bus and alleged that a minor collision between the bus and his car had occurred earlier. The victim, who was the bus driver, then asked for the accused’s particulars for insurance claims. However, the accused refused to do so. In the meantime, the bus driver contacted headquarters to provide a contact number to the accused. The accused waited in the bus, meanwhile. The victim, who had just finished his night shift, grew impatient and approached the accused and told him to stop wasting time and uttered vulgarities. The accused then punched the victim several times on his face. The victim had sustained injuries due to the blows on his face. The accused pleaded guilty to 1 charge under s 323 of the Penal Code and was sentenced to a fine of $4,000.

## Sentencing Considerations

21     The key issue before the Court, in deciding on the appropriate sentence to be imposed, was whether the custodial threshold was crossed in this case, and if so, what the appropriate length of custodial sentence would be. Central to the determination of the key issue was the question of whether this case should be classified as one involving road rage violence.

22     After having carefully considered the parties’ respective submissions, I was of the view that this case should be classified as a case involving road rage violence. I was also of the view that the custodial threshold was crossed, and the appropriate sentence would be 1 week’s imprisonment.

#### Whether this was a case involving road rage violence

23     I was of the view that this case fell squarely within the meaning of road rage as defined by the High Court in _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case.

24     The incident had clearly arisen out of the Accused and victim's shared use of the road. The victim was trying to squeeze his motorcycle in between the Accused's car and another car and had accidentally come into contact with the Accused's car's front-ride mirror as a result. The Accused was upset with the victim's act and decided to confront him and committed the acts of violence against the victim. This in my view was a clear case of violence specifically originating from differences arising through common road usage - _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case at \[21\].

25     I did not agree with the Defence’s submission that the facts of the present case bore significant similarities with that in _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case. I was in fact of the view that the factual matrixes were materially different. In _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case, the victim had just stepped into a zebra crossing when the accused drove his car through without stopping to give way to the victim. Upset by what happened, the victim used his open palm to hit the top of the accused's car. The accused then stopped his car and gave chase to and eventually ended up having an altercation with the victim. The High Court had found at \[51\] and \[52\] that the accused's ''rage'' which sparked off the assault had nothing to do with the traffic incident over the zebra crossing, but by the victim intentionally hitting the accused's car because he must have felt slighted by the accused not giving way to him at the zebra crossing. The High Court opined at \[53\] that the accused’s act was provoked by the victim and that if the victim had caused damage to the accused’s car, he could well have been charged for his actions and the deterrent sentencing policy against road rage would be applicable. The High Court then held at \[54\] that it would not be fair to treat the accused as having caused hurt to the victim due to the accused's road rage.

26     The same could not be said of either the victim or the Accused in our present case. The victim in the present case was trying to squeeze his motorcycle in between the Accused's car and another car and had _accidentally_ come into contact with the Accused's front-right mirror as a result. There is nothing in the act which can even be remotely considered as an act of road rage, even if there was damage done to the Accused’s car as a result of the victim’s act, which in this case, there was none. The Defence's submission that the facts of _Lim Yee Hua_ bear significant similarities to the present case and that the victim was the initial road rage aggressor was therefore clearly misconceived.

#### Whether the custodial threshold was crossed

27     The High Court in _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case had held at \[29\] that,

> ''when an offence committed under s 323 of the Penal Code involves road rage violence as defined in the manner that I have set out earlier in this judgment (see \[21\]-\[25\] above), ie, violence that stems specifically from conflicts that arise in the course of common road use, the deterrent sentencing policy underlying road rage violence must also apply. According to this sentencing policy, all road users are expected to exercise self-restraint, de-escalate conflict and amicably resolve their differences when a conflict arising from the shared use of the roads arises. Those who are unable to adhere scrupulously to this paradigm of road use conduct will be subject to deterrent sentences, on top of the usual sentencing considerations that accompany the particular offence committed. Put another way, ungentlemanly conduct arising in the course of the use of the roads, bad driving, breach of road traffic rules on the part of the victim and even serious traffic accidents caused by the victim would be insufficient to amount to provocation that justifies any act of causing hurt to the victim (or, indeed, any act of mischief causing damage to the victim's property); on the contrary, a violent reaction to such instances of road use would attract the deterrent sentencing policy underlying road rage violence.''

28     The level of restraint the law expects of road users is therefore a high one. The Accused’s conduct in respect of the charges had, in my view, fallen woefully short of the standard of behaviour and conduct expected of him as a road user.

29     I note, however, that a deterrent sentence in the context of road rage violence does not invariably translate to a custodial term.

30     In _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case, that Chan J (as he then was) had held at \[45\] that,

> “While I recognise the pressing need to broadcast an unreserved message of deterrence to the public at the time those decisions were issued, I respectfully take the view that it should not invariably be the case that a custodial term must be imposed for _all_ offences involving road rage violence. An offence of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code which arises out of road rage can involve a wide variety of possible fact situations. The fact that road rage is involved will mean that the policy considerations of a deterrent sentence will obviously kick in. Nevertheless, all the relevant circumstances of the case must still be considered in order to mete out a fair and appropriate sentence.”

31     Having considered all the relevant circumstances of the present case, however, I was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed.

32     In terms of the harm caused by the Accused’s acts, the victim had suffered a sprain /contusion to his left wrist and was given 2 days of medical leave. Based on the framework in _Low Song Chye’s_ case, this case would fall within Band 1 which carries an indicative sentencing range of a fine or short custodial term of up to 4 weeks.

33     In terms of culpability, I note that the Accused was the one who had started the incident by getting out of his car and confronting the victim. I did not agree with the Accused’s characterisation that it was the victim who had triggered the incident by coming into contact with the Accused’s vehicle’s front-right window. The Accused then used his hand to hit the helmet which the victim was wearing at the time (subject matter of MCN-900406-2020) before proceeding to commit the act which was the subject matter of the proceeded charge. It was preposterous in my view for the Accused to claim in his mitigation plea that he was not the aggressor.

34     The act of pulling the victim off his motorcycle in the middle of the road was a dangerous one even though it resulted, fortunately, only in the minor injuries suffered by the victim. I noted further that even after the witness had intervened, the Accused went on to push the victim’s face with both his palms, which was the subject matter of the charge in MCN-900408-2020. After the incident, the Accused had also driven off and left the scene.

35     It bore re-iterating that the victim had _accidentally_ come into contact with the front-right mirror of the accused's car. There was no indication of any damage done to the mirror, or any other part of the Accused’s vehicle. I was therefore unable to comprehend how the victim's act could have provoked the Accused into reacting in the manner that he did. Such senseless acts of violence over an incident as trivial as the present case is exactly what the deterrent sentencing policy for road rage cases was meant to address.

36     While I noted that the Accused had pleaded guilty and was untraced, I was nevertheless of the view that his gratuitous assault of the victim in the circumstances warranted a custodial sentence.

37     The Defence had referred to 2 precedent cases to support their submission for a non-custodial sentence. With respect to the case of _Ng Yong Ngee_, I was of the view that the facts bore resemblance to the case of _Lim Yee Hua_ in that the victim had first hit the accused’s car after the accused’s car almost caused a sideswipe with the bicycle the victim was riding. In _Lim Yee Hua’s_ case, the victim had similarly hit the accused’s car after the accused failed to stop at the zebra crossing which the victim was crossing. For the same reasons as I had set out at \[26\], I was of the view that _Ng Yong Ngee’s_ case should be similarly distinguished from the present case. As for the case of _Muhammad Azahar Bin Abdul Malik_, quite apart from the fact that it was an unreported decision, and hence of limited precedential value if any, I was also of the view that the case was clearly not one involving road rage violence. In that case, the incident was triggered when the victim became impatient with the accused and started hurling vulgarities at the accused whilst they were waiting inside the bus driven by the victim for certain information. This then caused the accused to punch the victim. It was therefore clearly not a case of violence specifically originating from differences arising through common road usage.

### Sentence Imposed

38     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that a short custodial term of would be appropriate.

39     In determining the appropriate length of imprisonment, I was of the view that it would be appropriate to refer to the precedent cases cited by the Prosecution.

40     In _Tan Zhenyang’s_ case, the High Court enhanced the sentence from a fine of $5,000 to 5 weeks imprisonment. I noted, however, that the nature of the assault by the accused on the victim was much more severe notwithstanding the relatively minor injuries sustained by the victim. The accused had punched the victim’s face, hit the victim repeatedly, grabbed the victim’s left arm as he was trying to escape. He also grabbed the victim’s neck and shoved him onto a nearby car causing a dent to the car and slapped the victim multiple times and also headlocked him.

41     In _Tan Chai Yong’s_ case, the accused was sentenced to 1 week’s imprisonment for slapping the victim’s face. No injury was sustained by the victim. I note, however, that the accused had claimed trial in that case.

42     In _Leong Ban Fatt’s_ case, the accused was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for swinging his arm at the victim’s face resulting in the victim suffering a lower lip abrasion. The victim was given 2 days MC. The accused in that case had claimed trial as well.

43     Having considered all the relevant circumstances of this case and drawn guidance from the precedent cases cited by the Prosecution, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence in this case should be **1 week’s imprisonment**.

## Conclusion

44     In summary, I was of the view that the present case was one involving road rage violence. As such the deterrent sentencing policy in respect of such cases would apply.

45     I was further of the view that the custodial threshold has been crossed in this case. Although the injury suffered by the victim was not serious, the Accused was the one who started the incident by confronting the victim and assaulting him after the victim had accidentally come into contact with the front-right mirror of the Accused's car. The Accused’s culpability as demonstrated by his reaction over an incident as minor as the present case, in my view, warranted a custodial sentence.

46     Having considered the totality of the facts and circumstances, and drawing guidance from the precedent cases cited, I was of the view that an imprisonment term of 1 week would be appropriate.

47     The Accused being dissatisfied with the decision had lodged an appeal against his sentence. He is currently on bail pending appeal.
