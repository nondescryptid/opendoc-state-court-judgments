### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

The Accused, 64 years old, pleaded guilty to a charge under section 65(b) of the Road Traffic Act (RTA), Chapter 276, wherein he:

> _“……..on 7 August 2019, at about 9:55pm, at the zebra crossing along the slip road of Woodlands Avenue 5 into Woodlands Avenue 2, Singapore, did drive motor taxi SH6708K, without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout ahead and collided into a pedestrian, namely Lee Xin Hui, female 34 years old, who was crossing the zebra crossing from \[his\] left side to right side and had the right of way….”_

2       This offence under section 65(b), RTA is punishable with a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.

3       I fined the Accused a sum of $800 (in default 4 days’ imprisonment) and imposed a disqualification of 2 months on all classes of licences, on him. The Accused is dissatisfied with the sentence.

## Facts

4       The facts of the case were largely encapsulated within the charge.

5       The in-car camera footage showed that the Accused was travelling along the slip road. He failed to slow down or stop before the zebra crossing and collided into the victim.

6       The victim sustained minor abrasions but refused to be treated at a hospital. The Accused was not injured from the accident; neither did his motor taxi sustain any visible damage.

7       At the time of the accident, the weather was fine and road surface was dry. Traffic flow was moderate and visibility was clear.

## Antecedents

8       This was the Accused’s first court conviction for a traffic offence.

9       The more notable compounded offences in the Accused’s driving history included speeding (2005, 2017) and a failure to conform to a red light signal (2015, 2018).

## Mitigation

10     In mitigation, the Accused admitted his wrong. He acknowledged that he did not slow down and was negligent. The Accused described his financial troubles and highlighted how a disqualification would severely affect his livelihood. He also informed the court of his health issues such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.

## Reasons for the Sentence

11     The facts and circumstances in this case did not warrant a custodial term. The victim was knocked down at a zebra crossing but sustained only minor abrasions. There was no medical report documenting any further injuries. In addition, the Accused pleaded guilty at first opportunity and he had expressed remorse for the accident. I was satisfied that a fine would suffice and the quantum of $800 was within the range of fines usually imposed for offences of this nature.

12     In respect of disqualification, I fully empathised with the Accused and the impact a disqualification would have on his livelihood. Notwithstanding, I was of the view that a short disqualification of 2 months was necessary as part of the sentence to be imposed for this offence.

13     The discretion to impose an order of disqualification is derived from Section 42 of the Road Traffic Act. Section 42 RTA states that a court may order a disqualification on a person who _“is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle”_. In considering the appropriate sentence for a person convicted of any offence connected with the driving of a motor vehicle, the law provides for an order of disqualification as a clear sentencing option for the court. In respect of traffic offences, an order of disqualification may be considered an integral component of the total sentence a Court may eventually impose for a traffic offence.

14     As recognized in the case of _Edwin Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 194</span> at \[13\] – \[14\]:

> _“A disqualification order combines three sentencing objectives: punishment, protection of the public and deterrence......Where an offence reflects a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users and a lack of personal responsibility, there is a public interest in taking such a driver off the roads for a substantial period of time”._

15     On the facts of this case, although a lengthy disqualification period was not warranted, a short one was. The offence of driving without reasonable consideration committed by the Accused in this instance, involved a failure to observe one of the most fundamental rules in driving, which was to keep a proper lookout and to give way to pedestrians who had a right of way, at a zebra crossing. The Accused had even failed to slow down or stop as he approached the zebra crossing along a slip road. It was purely fortuitous that the victim did not end up with more injuries than minor abrasions. In this vein, I also noted that the Accused did not have an impeccable driving record – he had compounded offences for speeding as well as failing to conform to traffic red light signals – yet another basic rule in driving for motorists.

16     An $800 fine, as the one I have imposed, may be “_paid once and forgotten_”[^1]. It would be the 2-month disqualification, with its attendant inconvenience and costs, that would serve to emphasize to the Accused the need to be a more careful and responsible driver on the roads in future.

17     I was mindful of the need for the overall sentence to be proportionate to the gravity of the offence. In my view, this was a sentence sufficient to achieve its sentencing objective, yet not too punishing on the Accused. This term of disqualification is also within the range of terms of disqualification generally imposed in the Traffic Court for plead-guilty cases of a similar nature under section 65(b) of the RTA.

18     The fine has been duly paid by the Accused. To date, there has been no application to stay the driving ban.
