### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused (56-year old female Singaporean) had a dispute with a neighbour. The police were called to the scene. When one of the officers tried to de-escalate the situation, the accused reacted by slapping the officer’s left hand. She then became disorderly and was placed under arrest and subsequently charged with a number of charges, including a charge of using criminal force on the said police officer. She pleaded guilty to the said charge and was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment. She was also given a fine for another charge of harassing her neighbour.

2       The prosecution is appealing against the one-week imprisonment in respect of the charge slapping the police officer’s hand. They had asked for four weeks’ imprisonment. The imprisonment sentence is stayed pending this appeal.

## Charges and Sentence

3       The accused pleaded guilty to the following two charges (“proceeded charges”):

(a)     First charge under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224 using criminal force against a police officer when he was executing his duty, by slapping his left hand (“criminal force offence or charge”)[^1]; and

(b)     Second charge under s 3(1)(a) punishable under s 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A) for harassing the her neighbour by ringing his doorbell and pouring water on his door (“POHA offence or charge”)[^2].

4       The accused also consented to have two other charges taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. These were one charge of disorderly behaviour under s 20 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184) and another charge under s 6(1)(a) of POHA for insulting the police officer by calling him “stupid”.

5       The individual sentences imposed in respect of the two proceeded charges are set out in the following table:

## Statement of Facts

6       The accused admitted to the statement of facts (“SOF”) presented by the prosecution without qualification which is reproduced in its entirety as follows:

The accused is Wee Sook Yee, a 56-year old female Singaporean bearing NRIC No.: XXX. She resides at 82A, Lorong 4 Toa Payoh, #XXX, Singapore 311082.

First Information Report

2.    On 21st January 2018, at or about 10.16 p.m., the victim called Police to inform: “I have a troublesome neighbour keep pressing the doorbell and pouring water outside my unit. Please assist”. The location given was at Blk 82A Lorong 4 Toa Payoh #XXX Singapore 311082.

Facts relating to MAC-910197-2018): Section 3(1)(A) p/u Section 3(2) Protection From Harassment Act (Cap 256a)

3.    The victim is Wong Fook Weng David (“Mr Wong”), a 65-year old male Singaporean bearing NRIC No.: XXX. He resided as Blk 82A Lorong 4 Toa Payoh #XXX Singapore 311082. He is the accused’s neighbour.

4.    Investigations revealed that on the 21st January 2018, the accused was disciplining her son over his school work inside her flat. While she was doing so, the accused heard Mr Wong whistling outside her flat. Hence, the accused decided to confront Mr Wong but she noticed that he had already taken the lift down. According to the accused, this was not the first time she had heard Mr Wong whistling whenever she was disciplining her son and she felt that Mr Wong had done it on purpose.

5.    On the same day, at or about 10 p.m., after the accused had waited for about 30 minutes for Mr Wong to return, she saw Mr Wong walking back to his flat. The accused went to her main gate and confronted Mr Wong as to why he had whistled earlier. Mr Wong looked at her, whistled and went inside his flat closing the main gate and front door behind him. The accused then walked over the Mr Wong’s flat and rang the doorbell located outside Mr Wong’s flat continuously for at least one minute with intent to cause harassment to Mr Wong. At that juncture, Mr Wong had already closed the front door to his flat and entered his flat but he could hear the doorbell ringing continuously. He also heard the accused shouting to ask him to come out but he did not open the door. The accused became angry, went back to her flat to take a pail of water and splashed the pail of water on the front door of Mr Wong’s flat. The accused repeated this about 2 – 3 times as she wanted Mr Wong to stop whistling. The water then seeped into Mr Wong’s living room. Mr Wong felt harassed by the accused’s actions. Mr Wong admitted that he would whistle from time to time whenever he felt happy but he did not do so to annoy the accused.

6.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has thereby committed an offence under section 3(1)(a) p/u section 3(2) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A).

**Facts relating to DAC-934583-2018: Section 353 Penal Code (Cap 224)**

7.    The victim is Staff Sergeant Ngoo Tse Ee (“SSGT Ngoo”), a 27-year old male. He is a police officer attached to Toa Payoh NPC. At the material time, he was performing fast response car duty together with his partner SGT Kelvin Ong Lin Wei (“SGT Kelvin”), and they had attended to the incident pursuant to the ‘999’ call made by Mr Wong. SSGT Ngoo and SGT Kelvin were public servants in the discharge of their duties as such public servants at the material time.

8.    Investigations revealed that on 21st January 2018, at 10.21 p.m., SSGT Ngoo and SGT Kelvin arrived at the common corridor outside of unit #XXX of Blk 82A Lorong 4 Toa Payoh, Singapore, and began to gather information from Mr Wong. At about 10.41 p.m., while SSGT Ngoo was talking to Mr Wong, the accused opened her gate and walked out of her flat with intention to walk towards Mr Wong’s flat. In order to prevent the matter from escalating, SSGT Ngoo approached the accused to stop her from confronting Mr Wong. SSGT Ngoo also advised the accused to calm down and to stay put near her flat. **_However, the accused became agitated and told SSGT Ngoo not to block her. All of a sudden, the accused swung her right hand to slap SSGT Ngoo’s left hand once. SSGT Ngoo felt pain in his left hand as a result of the slap but he did not seek medical attention._**

9.    Further investigations revealed that after SSGT Ngoo informed the accused that she would be placed under arrest for assaulting a police officer, she started shouting and put up a struggle. Necessary force was used to effect arrest.

10.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused had thereby committed an offence under section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

11.    The accused has admitted to the offences and she is charged accordingly.

(Emphasis added in relation to the criminal force offence)

## Prosecution’s Appeal

7       The prosecution appealed against the one-week imprisonment imposed on the accused because they had submitted for a four-week imprisonment sentence. They applied for the imprisonment sentence to be stayed. During their application for a stay of execution of the imprisonment sentence, the learned DPP confirmed that the prosecution’s appeal is only against the imprisonment sentence in respect of the criminal force offence. In other words, the prosecution has no issues with the fine that the court imposed on the accused in respect of the POHA charge.

8       The accused has already paid the fine. As such, I informed the learned DPP that I would confine the scope of my grounds of decision to address only the issue of the imprisonment sentence for the criminal force charge.

## Reasons for Sentence – Criminal Force Offence

9       I considered the personal circumstances of the accused as set out in the mitigation plea filed by her counsel.[^3] The accused is a 56-year old female homemaker. She is a first offender. As described in the mitigation, she has had “neighbourhood issues” with her next-door neighbour for many years. The proceeded POHA charge arose out of the long-standing feud between them. When the police were called to the scene, she then committed the criminal force offence when the police intervened.

10     In respect of the criminal force offence, counsel pleaded for only a fine in view of the accused’s clean record and her plea of guilt. It is not in dispute that this was the accused’s first brush with the law. However, I reminded counsel of the public interest to protect police officers which was re-affirmed by the High Court of three Judges in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ \[2017\] SGHC 306 (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”). The appellate court in _Jeffrey Yeo_ has thus set the tone for adequate sentences to be meted out in cases of assault against police officers. On the facts of the case and taking into account the TIC charges, and in the absence of exceptional mitigating factors, I told counsel that the custodial threshold has been crossed in respect of the criminal force charge.

11     In the alternative, counsel also asked the court to consider a community-based sentence (e.g. short detention order) but as was rightly pointed by the prosecution, such a sentence would not be an option for a criminal force offence in view of the maximum prescribed punishment. Ultimately, counsel accepted that a custodial sentence was justified and there is no appeal by the defence.

12     On the other hand, the prosecution asked for a sentence of at least four weeks’ imprisonment and has appealed against the one-week imprisonment sentence that was imposed. As noted earlier, the learned DPP had clarified to the court that their appeal is only confined to the imprisonment sentence in respect of the criminal force offence.

13     The prosecution tendered a table of five precedents in relation to a criminal force offence committed against police officers.[^4] I asked the learned DPP if he was relying, in particular, on any of the cited precedents. He highlighted the first precedent of _PP v Li Xiangnan[^5]_ which is an unreported decision of the lower court and which was not the subject of an appeal. The brief facts in that case were stated to be that the accused, who was drunk, had a quarrel with his wife at home. The situation got out of hand when the accused started throwing household appliances around and the police were called to the scene. They interviewed the accused who was uncooperative and refused to answer their questions. He also shouted at the officers and refused to calm down when advised to do so. He then turned his attention to his wife and shouted at her to come out of the room. When he tried to go into the room, the police officer told him to sit down. _He then pushed the officer in the chest and moved towards him._ _The other officers seeing that the accused was going to charge at the first officer stepped in to arrest the accused who put up a violent struggle._ He was eventually subdued with necessary force. The accused was charged for an offence of using criminal force and was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment.

14     I considered and compared the facts in _Li Xiangnan_ with the present case and. I took the view that the act of pushing the police officer in the chest and then attempting to charge at him in _Li Xiangnan_ is far more aggravating than the act of slapping the hand of the police officer in the present case. The amount of force and the degree of maliciousness in respect of both actions cannot be equated. In essence, a slap on the hand by a female accused is very different from a shove on the chest by a male accused. Furthermore, the accused in _Li Xiangnan_ was also drunk. He was far more aggressive than the present female accused who was a homemaker in her mid-fifties. While not trying to making light of her criminal act, I was of the view that her single slap on the officer’s hand must surely be less serious and aggressive than that of pushing the police officer in the chest and then attempting to charge at him as was the case in _Li Xiangnan_. I further considered that a slap on the hand is also not as degrading or humiliating as spitting at an officer (see _PP v Stephen Albert_ (MA 9254/2017); _PP v Rasaruddin Bin Abdul Rahaman_ (MA 9208/2017)) or slapping an officer in the face (see _PP v Walter Marcel Christoph_ which was cited by the prosecution), which acts would warrant a longer imprisonment term. The criminal force in the present case is also not as “insulting” as described by the High Court in _PP v Neo Rong Hao Benjamin_ (MA 9160/2017) where a male accused pushed a female officer in the chest and was sentenced on appeal to five weeks’ imprisonment.

15     I also considered that the present case is even less aggravating than the facts of another case of _PP v Kandasamy Ramesh_ which appears in prosecution’s table of precedents. In that case, the accused was caught urinating in public by the police. When the police issued a summons against him, the accused verbally abused the police. _He not only pushed the officer’s hand away_ (not very dissimilar to the present offence) _but also grabbed the officer’s vest._ In spite of the more aggressive behaviour and aggravating facts, the accused in that case was only sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.

16     I am aware and had considered that the accused’s slapping of the officer did cause pain to the officer (as stated in the SOF). However, the pain caused could not have been anything more than momentary and superficial considering that it was a single slap to a non-vulnerable part of the officer’s body. It was in fact so inconsequential that the officer did not seek medical treatment and certainly no injury was caused to him.

17     I also viewed and considered the body-worn camera footage[^6] that was shown in court and which accompanied the SOF that was read out to the accused. The video footage did not add anything to the written words of the SOF. The learned DPP also did not highlight any portion of the video footage which was aggravating and not encapsulated in the SOF.

18     I also considered the two TIC charges against the accused. The offence of disorderly behaviour and that of verbally berating the officer (_sans_ vulgarities or racial slurs) would have only attracted a fine even if the prosecution had proceeded with the two charges. The TIC charges would not and ought not to have the effect of increasing the imprisonment sentence for the criminal force offence to any significant degree. As I explained to counsel for the accused who had asked for a fine to be imposed for the criminal force offence, had the accused calmed herself down and apologised to the officer after slapping his hand, I would have considered imposing only a fine on her. In other words, if not for her acts that form the subject matter of the TIC charges, I would have given only a fine. Having said that, I did not think that the TIC charges would have the multiplier effect of augmenting the sentence to that of four weeks’ imprisonment that was sought by the prosecution.

## Conclusion

19     In conclusion, I considered that an imprisonment sentence of one week is fairly commensurate with a single slap of the hand of the officer, even against the backdrop of all the circumstances of the case. As emphasised by counsel in his mitigation[^7], this is the first time that the accused has been charged for any offence and certainly the first time that she is going to jail. An imprisonment sentence even for a week is by no means a mere slap on the wrist. Taking into account the accused’s remorse as demonstrated by her plea of guilt and her clean record, the sentence of one week’s imprisonment ought to be sufficient punishment for her and would also adequately serve as a deterrent to like-minded individuals.
