5 November 2021

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This appeal was brought by the accused, Mohamed Yasin Bin Sutoh (‘Mr Yasin”) against his conviction at trial on a single charge[^1] of possession of _diamorphine_ on 21 May 2021. At the scheduled date for his sentencing for the aforementioned charge, Mr Yasin conferred with his counsel Mr Malcolm Tan, appointed under Criminal Legal aid Scheme (CLAS) brief, and agreed to **_plead guilty_** to another charge[^2] of consumption of _methamphetamine_. Mr Yasin unfortunately had a long history of narcotic use, which rendered him liable to be sentenced as a class-one long-term imprisonment (typically expressed as LT-1), which carried a mandatory minimum of five-years’ imprisonment. Mr Yasin, presently aged 64, would have been exempt from the otherwise mandatory caning of three strokes.

2       Upon Mr Yasin’s confirmation of his plea, his unqualified admission of the facts for the latter charge, I imposed sentences of five years’ imprisonment for the LT-1 charge and two-years’ and four-months’ imprisonment for the possession charge that he had claimed trial to. I ordered this latter charge for _diamorphine_ possession to run **_concurrently_** with the five-year imprisonment term for the LT-1 _methamphetamine_ consumption charge that he had pleaded guilty to. Mr Yasin’s global sentence was thus five years’ imprisonment, which was ordered to commence from 25 October 2018.

3       As would be evident from the situation mentioned above, Mr Yasin’s appeal is atypical in the sense that its outcome will have absolutely **_no_** impact on the **_global_** sentence that was imposed. This is in the sense that Mr Yasin would still face the five-year imprisonment term imposed for his LT-1 consumption charge, even if he received an acquittal of the _diamorphine_ consumption charge which he had claimed trial to. Mr Yasin has not challenged his guilty plea for his LT-1 _methamphetamine_ consumption charge in respect of either substance or procedure, and has of course received the mandatory minimum sentence for that charge. Notwithstanding the lack of discernible utility to his appealing on a concurrent sentence which had been wholly subsumed by a longer sentence in relation to the unappealed LT-1 _methamphetamine_ consumption charge, Mr Yasin has an unquestioned right of appeal, and these grounds are therefore set out on this premise.

### The proceeded charge

4       Mr Yasin **_claimed trial_** to the following _diamorphine_ **_possession_** charge[^3]:

> (_Mr Yasin is_) charged that you, on 17/10/2018 at or about 04:50 am, at 268 Geylang Road did have in (_his_) possession a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (CAP.185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, **_one packet containing not less than 1.94 grams of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.02 gram of diamorphine_**, without any authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and (_he has_) thereby committed an offence under Section 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev. Ed)

> And further, that (he), before the commission of the said offence, were on 24/04/2000 in Court 18 of the District Court, vide DAC03236/2000, convicted of an offence for possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 1998 Rev. Ed) and punished under s 33(1) of the said Act with 15 months imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you shall now be punished under s 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

> \[Emphasis added\]

5       Mr Yasin thus faced a mandatory minimum term of at least two years’ imprisonment if convicted. The maximum term he faced would be ten years’ imprisonment on the single proceeded charge.

### Stood down charge

6       For completeness, this is the stood-down LT-1 charge[^4] for _methamphetamine_ consumption which Mr Yasin tendered his plea of guilt at the conclusion of the proceedings for the aforementioned contested possession charge:

> (_Mr Yasin is_) charged that (_he_), on or before the 17/10/2018, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), _to wit_, _Methamphetamine_, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and (_he has_) thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the said act,

> and further,

> that (_he_), before the commission of the said offence, (_was_) on 08/02/2003 in Court 15 of the District Court, _vide_ DAC06263/2003, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, _Methamphetamine_, under Sec 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Chapter 185, 2008 Rev. Ed) and punished under sec 33(1) of the said Act with 54 months imprisonment, and is deemed to be a previous conviction of a specified drug by virtue of Sec 33A(5)(a)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185 2001 Rev Ed.) and (_was_) on 04/10/2006, pursuant to an order made by the Director of the Central Narcotics Bureau in Singapore under section 34(2)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed), admitted to an approved institution, namely, Drug Rehabilitation Centre, for consumption of a controlled drug, to wit, _Buprenorphine_, which is a previous admission by virtue of s 33A(5)(c)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and (_he is_) thereby liable to be punished under Sec 33A(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

### Statement of Agreed Facts

7       Considerable savings in time were afforded by the prosecution and defence tendering a Statement of Agreed Facts, which obviated the need to call certain ‘technical’ witnesses to prove the maintenance of the chain of custody, authenticate the physical exhibits, depose as to the presence (or absence) of interpretable traces of DNA and, especially, state the fact that “_granular/powdery_” substance allegedly recovered from Mr Yasin was _diamorphine_ of the quantity stated in the proceeded charge (to the effect that the 1.94g of granular or powdery substance, had upon analysis yielded 0.02g of the proscribed opioid _diamorphine_ . The Statement of Agreed Facts stipulated as follows:

> The Prosecution and the Defence hereby agree that:

> **Introduction**

> 1    The accused is Mohamed Yasin Bin Sutoh (the "accused")… At the material time, the accused was 61 years old.

> **Facts relating to the proceeded charge - Possession of a controlled drug (DAC 910243-2019)**

> 2    On 17 October 2018, at about 4.50 am, the accused was approached by plain clothes police officers at 268 Geylang Road (the "Incident Location") as part of their routine checks. The police officers conducted a search on the accused.

> 3     **_Following the search on the accused, he was placed under arrest. One black key pouch_** (later marked 'YASIN-2') (the "Key Pouch") **_and one packet containing brown granular/powdery substance_** (later marked 'YASIN-1') (the "Packet") **_were sent to the Central Narcotics Bureau_** ("CNB").

> 4    Exhibit "YASIN-1" was subsequently sealed in a tamper-proof bag and submitted to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory ("IDL") of the Health Sciences Authority ("HSA") for analysis on 22 October 2018. From the point of the accused's arrest to the eventual submission to HSA, "YASIN-1" was securely stored, properly accounted for, and not tampered with in any way.

> 5    On 16 November 2018, Dr Chin Shi Liy Reenie, an analyst with the IDL of the HSA, having conducted the analysis in relation to Exhibit "YASIN-l", issued a certificate under section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev. Ed.) ("MDA") bearing Lab No. : ID-1832-02548-001.

> 6    The certificate states that Exhibit "YASIN-1" was found to be one packet containing not less than 1.94 grams of granular/powdery substance, which was homogenised into a powdery substance. **_The powdery substance was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.02 gram of diamorphine_** (the "Drugs").

> 7    Diamorphine is a Class A controlled dmg listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The accused is not authorized under the MDA or the Regulations thereunder to have a controlled drug, including in particular diamorphine, in his possession.

> 8    DNA testing done on the Packet did not reveal any interpretable DNA profile on the same.

> 9    Further, the accused was, on 24 April 2000 in Court 18 of the Subordinate Courts, vide DAC03236/2000, convicted of an offence for possession of a controlled dmg (diamorphine) under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185,1998 Rev. Ed.) and punished under s 33(1) of the said Act with 15 months' imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to-date.

> 10    As a result of the aforesaid conviction on 24 April 2000, the accused will be liable to face enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA if he is convicted of this charge.

> **Admission of exhibits**

> 11    The Prosecution and the Defence agree for the documentary exhibits (listed in Annex A) to be marked and admitted into evidence without the need to call any witnesses to the stand to testify as to the same. The accuracy and contents of the documentary exhibits at items 5, 6 and 7 of Annex A are not disputed.

> The above facts are not disputed and are agreed upon between the Prosecution and Defence pursuant to Section 267(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

> \[_signatures of DPP and counsel_\]

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Witnesses and their roles

8       The prosecution called the following witnesses:

> **PW1 Ahmad Razali Bin Jamil** (“Officer Razali”)- A police Staff Sergeant based at Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre, Officer Razali was a member of arresting party who had encountered the accused with PW3 , Officer Brandon Chong.

> **PW2 Badawi Bin Abubakar Bagarib** (“Officer Badawi”)-An officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) based at Bedok Police Division. Officer Badawi recorded a statement[^5] (the first Long Statement) where the accused admitted to the consumption of both “_Amphetamine_” or “_Ice_”[^6] and “_Panas_” or “_Heroin_”[^7], along with benzodiazepines and unprescribed medication for _diabetes mellitus_.

> **PW 3 Brandon Chong Guan Tao** (“Officer Chong”)- A police Senior Staff Sergeant, Officer Chong was a member of the arresting party and the principal figure whom the accused interacted with.

> **PW 4 Adly Idzuan Bin Roslan** (“Officer Adly )- An officer from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), Officer Adly had processed the accused’s arrest report[^8] in his capacity as investigating officer handling arrestees who were LT-1 liable, and recorded his second Long Statement and Cautioned Statement.

9       The Defence’s case rested on the testimonies of the following witnesses

> **DW1 Mohamed Yasin Bin Sutoh** (“Mr Yasin”)- The accused.

> **DW2 Mutiara (**“Ms Mutiara”)- close friend of the accused, who was a purported scene witness.

### Summary of facts and statement of issues in dispute

10     Mr Yasin’s contest in his possession charge lay principally in the disputed circumstances behind a singular event which had led to the apparent recovery of a sachet or packet[^9] of brown granular or powdery substance from his person, which upon analysis, yielded 0.02 grams of the opioid drug _diamorphine_ (better known in its street name of _heroin_). This had occurred in the early hours 17 October 2018, at or about 4.50 am, at 268 Geylang Road, when Mr Yasin has been approached by plain clothes police officers. According to the testimonial evidence in the prosecution’s case, Mr Yasin had been interdicted by Officer Chong and Officer Razali, and he had been searched upon the officers’ realization that Mr Yasin was the subject of an outstanding warrant. Officer Chong had found the black key holder pouch, from the right pocket of Mr Yasin’s trousers. Officer Chong stated that the packet containing the granular/powdery substance had, in turn, been found within the pouch during the search.

##### Applicable presumption under the Misuse of Drugs Act

11     A discovery in these circumstances would afford the prosecution to rely on the presumption _vide_ section 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, which provides that:

> _Presumption of possession and knowledge of controlled drugs_

> 18 (1)    Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control –

>> (a)    anything containing a controlled drug;

>> …

>> shall, until the contrary is proved, **_be presumed to have had that drug in his possession_**.

> (2)    Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be **_presumed to have known the nature of that drug_**.

12     As can be seen, the provision triggers presumptions that the accused was firstly in “_knowing possession”_ of the drugs in the sense that of presuming that he was **_aware_** that he was **_carrying_** the drugs in the receptacle they were found in; and secondly, that the accused person also _knew of “the nature of that drug_” which meant, in the instant situation, that he had known the granular/powdery substance to be _diamorphine_. A statement[^10] recorded from Mr Yasin would show his acknowledgment that “_Panas_” which was yet another colloquial or street name for _diamorphine_, had been found on him. While Mr Yasin did not dispute that he had been stopped and searched or that the key pouch was his, he would, at trial, conversely take the position that there had been no packet of granular/powdery substance within, and insinuated that the searching police officer, Officer Chong had, by some sleight of hand, planted the drugs to implicate him with the crime. Specifically, Mr Yasin’s assertion was that Officer Chong took the pouch out of his line of sight during the search and then planted the sachet to present it with the black pouch moments later.[^11] Mr Yasin’s contention was also quite specific as he asserted that the key pouch had been on his person, and that he had not allowed any other person to handle his pouch at any time before his interdiction by the police. He would also, in a later statement[^12] recorded **_seven_** days later, register his dispute that his pouch was insufficiently capacious to contain the packet of _diamorphine_.

13     Hence the central dispute would be the differing accounts of the PW3, Officer Chong and the accused Mr Yasin, himself, which could be simply framed “**_Was the sachet of diamorphine on Mr Yasin’s person when he was stopped and searched by a team of police officers which included Officer Chong and his partner, or did the latter police officer surreptitiously plant the drugs in or around the key pouch when he searched Mr Yasin_**” with cascading consequences appurtenant to either version.

14     For Mr Yasin’s case, which was predicated on the _diamorphine_ sachet not being present in his black key pouch at the time of his interception, and that the seeming recovery of the sachet from his pouch had been a staged ‘planting’ event orchestrated by Officer Chong during his search, the presumption of knowledge stated above would effectively rebutted from his absence of knowledge of the sachet’s very existence, and _a fortiori_, that any knowledge of the nature of its contents. It should also be noted that two other persons who were called as scene witnesses, PW2; Officer Razali and DW2, Ms Mutiara, **_did not have any cogent recollection_** of this critical event for reasons which will be elaborated on further in these grounds. I should add that Mr Yasin has claimed that there had been a third police officer at the scene, but the prosecution has asserted that only PW2, Officer Razali had been there with Officer Chong.

## THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION

## EVIDENCE OF SCENE WITNESSES

### Evidence of PW3 Senior Staff Sergeant Brandon Chong Guan Tao

15     Senior Staff Sergeant Brandon Chong Guan Tao (“Officer Chong”) was the principal scene witness as the officer who had searched Mr Yasin and apparently found the sachet of _diamorphine_. This was because he was the only officer with who specifically recalled the event, with his partner, Officer Razali testifying that he was unable to recall the specific details[^13] of what had transpired at Mr Yasin’s interception and subsequent arrest. Officer Razali’s inability to recall was attributed to the search process being a common occurrence in the course of his patrolling duties at the time, and nothing had occurred then as to distinguish Mr Yasin’s stoppage and arrest from the multitude among “_a lot of arrests_” he had conducted within that period. Incidentally, it transpired during her later testimony that Ms Mutiara, Mr Yasin’s witness, was not even present[^14] during that critical juncture.

### Stoppage and arrest of accused

16     Officer Chong stated that he and Officer Razali had been patrolling the precincts of Geylang in their capacity as Crime Strike Force officers attached to Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre. On the night in question, during the wee hours of 17 October 2018, Officer Chong had been engaged in a ‘_proactive_’ anti-crime patrol conducted with a view to looking out for suspicious characters, such as persons ‘_loitering with intent’_.[^15] Of a unit of four officers assigned to the team, only **_two_** officers would patrol in each instance. Officer Chong would expect to partner with Officer Razali about half the time. The standard procedure would be when a ‘_person of interest’_ was spotted, for the officers to check on the person by first engaging in a ‘_consensual conversation_’ and then obtaining their particulars and checking these individuals to screen for whether a person was posted as a wanted individual in the police gazette. If a warrant to arrest was in force, the officers were duty bound to execute the warrant.

17     Officer Chong had seen Mr Yasin walking along a ‘_five-foot way_’ passage near a corner shop house[^16] as their car drove along Geylang Road at a pace of under 20 km/h. Mr Yasin’s presence alone at that time of night piqued their interest, and Officer Chong parked their vehicle and proceeded on foot to find Mr Yasin. When accosted near 266 Geylang Road, Mr Yasin was co-operative in engaging in Officer Chong in a consensual conversation.

18     The police officer discovered that Mr Yasin had a pending warrant, and was wanted by the Warrant Enforcement Unit. He had proceeded to process Mr Yasin’s arrest, continuing with a consensual conversation as to whether the accused was aware of the court date he had been scheduled to attend, or if he had “_any summons he had not paid_[^17]” (which I took to be a reference to unsettled fines).

### Search of accused

19     Thereafter Officer Chong performed the standard search to “_clear him of items_” before he was brought to the charge office, which was situated at the lock-up in Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre. The procedure would entail the suspect emptying his bag or pockets onto a flat surface which the officer could see. After this had been done, the suspect was told that a ‘frisk search’ would be conducted on his person and was asked to declare if there were any other items on his person before Officer Chong continued. In his court testimony, the witness stated that his frisking had determined that Mr Yasin was an “_item in his pocket_” which he had failed to empty in the prior step of the procedure. Officer Chong had inquired about his omission, but Mr Yasin had “_just remained silent_”.[^18] Officer Chong had then queried the accused[^19]:

> “_Sorry, Sir. I just told you that everything out, this is a frisk search. Why do you choose to leave something in your pocket where I have clearly stated everything to be out for the check_?” …(S)eeing that he was reluctant to answer, being quiet…. **_I believe I took out the-- item from his pocket and place it on either the boot or the table wherever I was checking him_**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Discovery of black pouch and Ziplock sachet

20     Officer Chong had recovered the black pouch from right front pocket of his trousers or ‘_pants_’,[^20] and been suspicious about Mr Yasin’s hesitancy as there had been ample time to declare the presence of his pouch in the systemic search process, and he would have a more than adequate opportunity to “_digest what is going on_”. Officer Chong’s next interactions with Mr Yasin were especially significant to the prosecution’s case, and therefore worth setting out[^21]:

> …(T)he last item that I checked was … the key pouch. Upon opening, then I discovered that, uh, a ziplock bag containing brown powdery substance was found. So, with that, … I started my pre-interview with him, … to find out where the source came from. **_At that point of moment, accused actually admitted to me that it was… heroin. I did not state whether what substance it was, merely saying that it was a brown powdery substance. He replied on his own it was heroin._** So, after which …I immediately asked him, “Either you would like to share with me who you bought it from or where have you gotten it from? At least share with us the source so we can refer to the right agency, per se, which is… CNB.”

### Accused’s spontaneous admission that the items were ‘Panas’, vernacular for diamorphine

21     Officer Chong demonstrated how he had found the sachet containing _diamorphine_ inside the black pouch, after opening the enclosing flaps with a flipping motion that he demonstrated in court. After discerning that the presence of the packet in the centre compartment, he had been careful not to touch the packet as he was **_ungloved_**[^22] and was concerned not to contaminate the sachet with traces of his own DNA. Officer Chong also clarified that Mr Yasin had not actually used the term ‘_heroin_’, but had spontaneously declared that the granular or powdery substance within the _Ziploc_ sachet that had been found in the middle compartment of the black pouch was ‘_Panas_’ a commonly used term in the Malay vernacular for _heroin_ or _diamorphine_. Officer Chong also explained the context upon which Mr Yasin’s reference to ‘_Panas_’ (which literally meant ‘_hot_’ ) was unequivocally a reference to diamorphine in the context the words were uttered[^23]:

> DPP:  Now, what did he say …in reply to your question about the packet?

> PW3:  (_T_)o be exact, I cannot commit exactly which part he say but it was along this line that, .., in Malay, “_What is this?_” And he would say that this is…as they call _panas_,, in… Malay …which is hot substances as we term it to be heroin. (i)f they say “_sejuk_”, cold it would be Ice. That is how we …decipher what they are speaking about. So, when we reaffirm to him that, “_You say it’s panas, so …I would assume it’s heroin. Uh, am I right_?” **“****_Uh, yes, but, uh, it’s not mine. I bought it from somewhere_****.”** **_Can’t remember what he said, either a friend or he bought it from someone_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

22     Officer Chong added that he had been main person in the frisking and questioning of Mr Yasin, which his partner, Officer Razali, performed a ‘covering officer’ role, keeping watch on the accused and being vigilant for any cues that Mr Yasin might seek to flee or become violent. This comported with Officer Razali’s testimony, where he confirmed his role in such a scenario. After completing his search and preliminary questioning, Officer Chong who was in _mufti_ or plainclothes, would then call for uniformed police officers to attend at the scene in a conventional police car to escort Mr Yasin back to the headquarters of Bedok (or Golf) Police Division.

### Cross examination of PW3

23     Defence counsel Malcolm Tan, who had been briefed by CLAS, was meticulous at cross examination, and especially so in establishing the exact location of the search, as well as determine whether the sachet was _per_ his client’s instructions too big to fit the pouch while the keys remained within. In relation to the latter, Officer Chong recreated the placement and position of the keys, with a test fit of the sachet of drugs, and demonstrated that the sachet could easily fit in the pouch as both counsel and witness attested that “_the Ziplock bag is relatively smaller than the pouch_”.[^24] This was notable as I observed that the pouch had not been handled for a not insubstantial period of time and would have likely lost some pliability, but proved to be dimensionally able to easily accommodate the _Ziplock_ sachet.

24     Essentially, Officer Chong appeared to have more than adequate powers of observation and recall, being able to recollect that the contents were partially clumped in granules and partially powdery (as would be expected from storage in a receptable such as a pouch) and sufficiently conscientious as to scrupulously record such details as his recovery of the pouch from the right front trouser pocket of Mr Yasin’s jeans in his contemporaneous records. He also struck as a forthright witness who answered counsel’s questions as effusively and comprehensively at cross-examination as he had while being questioned by the DPP during his examination-in-chief. The learned DPP was quite right to observe[^25] that Officer Chong’s testimony remained unshaken through the rigorous cross-examination undertaken by counsel Malcolm Tan.

### Evidence of PW1 Staff Sergeant Ahmad Razali Bin Jamil

25     Although Staff Sergeant Ahmad Razali Bin Jamil (“Officer Razali”) gave his testimony as the first prosecution witness, I have interposed to set out Officer Chong’s testimony first, as the latter was the principal scene witness for the prosecution, with the latter confirming his presence at the material time but having a far less distinct impression of the events of that day, as nothing extraordinary had occurred that day which would set the occasion apart for other confrontations and searches of suspects while on patrol. Officer Razali was a fellow member of Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre’s Crime Strike Force unit, and tasked to conduct patrols in the precincts of Geylang’s various ‘_Lorongs_’ to “_deter and detect crime_”. When Officer Razali gave his evidence in April 2020, he was candid in admitting that he had no specific recollection of his encounter with Mr Yasin in the early hours of 17 October 2018, as he had effected “_a lot of arrest_(s)”[^26] with Officer Chong as his partner, and thus could not remember Mr Yasin by his appearance alone. While the accused had been insistent that there had been three police officers present at the time of the frisk search, Officer Razali corroborated Officer Chong’s account that only two officers were typically assigned for patrol duty.

26     While, as indicated above, there had been nothing extraordinary which had occurred then which would have jogged Officer Razali’s memory of the encounter with Mr Yasin, he was emphatic that the two would always follow set standard operating procedures (SOPs) when a person of interest was stopped. These guiding procedures were stringently observed as any deviation “_would jeopardise the accused’s safety and our safety, thus, it_ (was) _very important for us to actually adhere to the SOP of conducting checks_.”[^27]

### Standard operating procedure for searches requires the searched person to visually track items recovered

27     The aspect of the SOP which was of interest would be the practice of always ensuring that an item recovered from a searched individual would remain within that person’s field of vision. This went to the extent of the officers continually reminding the searched person to track his eyes to the item as it was placed in from of him. In this regard the following extract from Officer Razali’s testimony in responding to the learned DPP’s query as to the handling of items found on a person of interest is cogent[^28]:

> PW1    (_In accordance with SOP, if an item is found_) basically, even if it’s the item that we suspect that might be, uh, incriminating or perhaps, it’s just a normal belongings to him, **_we will always put it in front of him in his presence with his eye contact on that particular item at all times as this is important due to the sensitivity of chain of evidence_**.

> Q    So, when you say “_put in front of him_”, would it be on the floor, on the table, where would it be?

> A    Uh, depending on the situation, but … most importantly it **_must be in front of him with his eyes focused on that item at all times. If_** (he) **_were to look away, we will remind him again and again to look at his item and belongings at all times as to ensure that---that there will be no allegation_**...

> \[Emphasis added\]

28     Officer Razali had made it clear that objects were handled in full view of searched persons, who were enjoined to maintain their gaze on the items, which were invariably set out on a flat surface (typically a car bonnet or a table) in front of them. At cross-examination, Officer Razali maintained that _per_ this procedure, Mr Yasin would have been facing the car boot as objects would be taken out and shown to him as they were placed on the car boot[^29]. Given PW1’s evidence on the meticulous and thorough standard operating procedures put in place to ensure that persons of interest could see the items being removed, and being put before them, Mr Yasin’s claim that the sachet containing _diamorphine_ had somehow been secreted into the pouch by Officer Chong seemed implausible, absent a premeditated collusion by **_both_** officers to incriminate a person who they had just encountered on their streets while on patrol. The contrasting scenarios put forth by both prosecution and defence will be fleshed out and juxtaposed in the later part of these grounds.

## EVIDENCE OF RECORDING OFFICERS

### Evidence of PW2 Badawi Bin Abubakar Bagarib

29     In the aftermath of the events set out above, Mr Yasin recorded two Long Statements, the first in the afternoon of 17 October 2018 and the next a week later on 24 October 2018. Neither statement has been challenged for voluntariness, and indeed the latter statement was admitted at counsel’s as a defence exhibit[^30]. The recording of the first statement had been handled by Central Narcotics Bureau investigation officer Badawi Bin Abubakar Bagarib (“Officer Badawi”), who was from the CNB unit conterminously based at Bedok Police Division. The officer had been on duty and tasked to receive arrested suspects handed over from the police to CNB. Mr Yasin was one such individual. Officer Badawi’s function was to record a statement from this referred suspect. He recalled that the statement taking, which began at 4.55 pm on 17 October 2018, had taken about an hour and 35 minutes.[^31] There had been a delay of several hours from the time of arrest, as Mr Yasin had, _per_ standard procedure, been required to provide urine samples first. This initial test was administered by police officers. The Instant Urine test (IUT) had yielded some positive results, and Mr Yasin had been given an opportunity to explain these results.

### Accused admits to consuming methamphetamine, diamorphine and benzodiazepines in his first Long Statement

30     It was within this context of the IUT results that the accused admitted to the **_consumption_** of three illicit sets of narcotic drugs including “_Amphetamine_” or “_Ice_”[^32] and “_Panas_” or “_Heroin_”[^33] (which the vernacular and street names for _diamorphine)_ as well as benzodiazepines. Mr Yasin had admitted to these as the IUT result had preliminarily registered positive results for the three drug categories of “_Amphetamine_”, “_Opiate_” and “_Benzodiazepines_.”. Officer Badawi had shown him the IUT result slip and had separately queried him on each drug category for which the IUT test had yielded a positive result.[^34] Officer Badawi noted Mr Yasin’s familiarity with the three terms. When asked about the ‘_Amphetamine_’ finding, Mr Yasin had spontaneously responded that he “smoked _sejuk_”,[^35] which was the street name for _methamphetamine_.

### Accused seemed aware that the sachet of granular/powdery substance contained diamorphine, even before any analysis results were made known

31     What was of especial interest to the present proceedings was the accused stating unequivocally in his Long Statement that “**_there was 01 packet_** **_containing ‘Heroin_****_”_**[^36] that Officer Chong had apparently recovered from the key pouch and a later reference “_I am now being shown a photo marked ‘MY-A1’[^37]._ **_The item is 01 packet_** **_of ‘panas_**’[^38]. In respect of the later reference. Mr Yasin goes on to deny that the ‘_panas_’ (or _diamorphine)_ was his, but never makes any specific allegation that Officer Chong, or indeed any other officer, had planted the packet in his pouch.[^39] Notwithstanding Mr Yasin’s denial, the accused’s seemly preternatural ability to discern the nature of the powdery and granular substance must attract a measure of suspicion. Unlike the IUT results which had flagged his apparent consumption of illicit narcotics, there had been no scientific analysis of the granular/powdery substance in the sachet at the time the first Long Statement had been recorded, and hence no basis to definitively state that the _Ziploc_ sachet contained ‘_panas_’ or ‘_Heroin_’, unless of course he had **_actual prior knowledge_** of the presence and nature of the substance (_diamorphine_) found upon analysis.

32     Indeed the confirmation _via_ a certificate from the Health Sciences Authority’s Illicit Drugs Laboratory[^40] confirming that the approximately two grams of granular/powdery substance contained _diamorphine_ only came into being on 16 November 2018, almost a month after he had given this initial statement on 17 October 2018. It should also be noted that of the three types of illicit drugs traced, only _methamphetamine_ was found in levels sufficient to support prosecution. This formed the basis of the charge[^41] which was stood down during the course of Mr Yasin’s trial for diamorphine possession.

33     To add to the incongruities of Mr Yasin’s account, he claimed that he had “_told the officer_ (presumably Officer Chong being the searching officer) _that it_ (being the _“Heroin”_ referred to in the same paragraph) _might have been given to me by my friend but I cannot remember_.” This statement, of course, would be irreconcilably incongruent with any allegation that Officer Chong had planted the drugs. Given the nature and extent of the accused’s dispute, it would be apposite to set out the accused’s first Long Statement in full. This following is a _verbatim[^42]_ reproduction of Mr Yasin’s statement given on 17 October:

> I am the above-mentioned subject and my particulars are true and correct. I am fine and comfortable to provide my statement, I want my statement to be taken in Malay language as I understand it better. I am known as “Yassin” to my friends and family members. I am divorced. I do not have any children. I am no longer staying in my residential address. My official address is given to me by HDB. I was supposed to stay in the unit with another person given by HDB. I could not get along with my other occupant and I chose to leave the house. Since then, I have been sleeping at the road sides or anywhere that I can sleep. I am presently working part-time as a foreman. I get to earn SCD $1000 a month, I do have hand phone but I cannot remember my hand phone number.

> 2.    I do have police and drug records. The last time I was sent to Changi Prison was in 2009 for trafficking of drugs. I have been sent to DRC on several occasions before 2009.

> 3.    Today (17/10/2018) at about 0450 hrs, I was at a coffee shop located at Geylang Lorong 16 with my friends drinking beer when we were stopped by a group of people. They told us that they were police officers and that they wanted to interview us. The officer asked for my particulars and I gave him my IC. After waiting for a while, I was asked by one of the officers to go to the backlane of the coffee shop. There they told me I was ‘WANTED’ and they wanted to do a further check on me. The officer asked if I had anything illegal to declare and I emptied all of my bags onto a car boot. I also emptied all of my pockets and place my items on the car boot. **_The officer then picked up the key pouch that I had placed on the car boot and held it in his hands. When he placed it on the car boot again, there was 01 packet containing ‘Heroin’._** The officer asked me who it belongs to and I told him that I do not know who it belongs to and that the item does not belong to me. **_I told the officer that it might have been given to me by my friend but I cannot remember_**, after that I was placed under arrest. I was then escorted to Bedok Police Division.

> 4.    When I arrived at Bedok Police Division, I was asked to provide my urine sample for testing. I was given enough time and water to drink. Once I was ready, I informed the officer and I did as I was instructed by the officer and provided my urine sample. At the end of the process, I deposited two bottles containing my urine sample into two metal containers that is attached together. I was told that my urine sample tested positive for Amphetamine, Opiate and Benzodiazepines and that my urine will be sent to HSA for analysis.

> 5.    I am now being asked why my urine tested positive for Amphetamine. The reason why my urine tested positive for Amphetamine is because I had ~relapsed to smoking~[^43] smoked ‘Ice’. The last time I smoked ‘Ice’ was on 16/10/2018 at about 2000hrs. I smoked ‘Ice’ alone at the staircase manding of a HDB Block located at Geylang Serai Market. I cannot remember the exact block. I will put the ‘Ice’ on a piece of aluminium foil. I will then use a lighter to burn the bottom of the aluminium foil, once there is fumes I will use a rolled up paper to inhale the fumes. The first puff I did not feel anything. After about 06 puffs I will start to feel awake and strong. At one time I can get about 04 puffs. I will smoke about 04 times each time I smoke ‘Ice’. The reason why I smoke ‘Ice’ is because I thought it can improve my sex life and improve during sex. I started to smoke ‘Ice’ about 01 month ago.

> 6.    I get my ‘Ice’ from a male Chinese near Geylang Lorong 23. I do not know the name of the male Chinese. I knew him when we were inside Changi Prison. The last time I bought ‘Ice’ from him was on 16/10/2018. I bought a small zip lock of ‘Ice’ for SGD $30. I do not have his contact number.

> 7.     **_I am now being asked why my urine tested positive for Opiate. The reason why my urine tested positive for Opiate is because I smoke I relapsed to smoking ‘Panas’. I refer to ‘Panas’ as ‘Heroin’. The last time I smoke ‘Panas was on 16/10/2018 at about 1700hrs. I smoke ‘Panas’ alone. I smoke at the toilet of the coffee shop located near Geylang Lorong 23. I do not know the name of the coffee shop. I will put the ‘Panas’ on a piece of aluminium foil. I will then use a lighter to burn the bottom of the aluminium foil. Once there is fumes, I will use a rolled-up paper to inhale the fumes. The first puff I did not feel anything. I will not feel anything after smoking ‘Panas’ At 01 time I will smoke about 06 puffs of ‘Panas’. I will only smoke ‘Panas’ on occasions or when I feel like it. The reason why I relapsed to smoking ‘Panas’ is because I wanted to just try the feeling again. I relapsed to smoking ‘Panas’ about 01 month ago._**

> 8.     **_I get my ‘Panas’ from a male Malay near Geylang Lorong 27. I walked past that area before and I always saw him standing around that area. I then approached him if he had any ‘Panas’, He told me he has and I asked him for SGD$10 of ‘Panas” do not know his name or contact number_**

> 9.    I am now being asked why my urine tested positive for Benzodiazepines. The reason why my urine tested positive for Benzodiazepines is because I consumed ‘Epam’ The last time I consumed ‘Epam’ tablets was on 16/10/2018 at about 2100hrs. I consumed 5 tablets orally I bought the ‘Epam’ from a male Chinese at the Coffee Shop near Geylang Lorong 23. I do not know the name of the male Chinese located at Geylang Lorong 20. I bought one slab of ‘Epam’ for SGD $2. I did not abuse any ‘Erimin 5’.

> 10.    (_Accused goes on to describe his consumption of diabetes medication a week before, which was sourced from a friend from a coffee shop, as he had been ‘lazy’ to queue up to see a doctor_)

> 11.    (_Accused identifies his black key pouch_)

> 12.     **_I am now being shown a photo marked ‘MY-A1’._** **_The item is 01 packet of ‘panas’_** **_It does not belong to me_**.

> 13.    I know that it is against the law to consume controlled drugs in Singapore.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Evidence of PW4 Adly Idzuan Bin Roslan

34     PW4, Adly Idzuan Bin Roslan (“Officer Adly’) had been assigned to Mr Yasin’s case in the period after his arrest after the accused had been sent for medical observation at a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC)[^44]. Given Mr Yasin’s IUT test, and his prior drug antecedents making him eligible for LT-1 sentencing, Officer Adly had been required to look into the review the exhibits seized in Mr Yasin’s arrest report[^45], and noted the pouch, which was of the _Bonia_ brand and the sachet to be the prime exhibits.

35     Mr Yasin had been returned from DRC back to CNB custody after seven days, and Officer Adly had recorded a further statement, where the accused now asserted that a “_Chinese officer_” handling his pouch and **_throwing_** it back onto the car boot where search items had been laid out, leading to ‘_the packet of “Heroin_”’ falling out from the key pouch. In this instance, the accused had made a specific allegation that the pouch had been planted by the officer, as he claimed that the pouch had been too full to accommodate the sachet. Mr Yasin had also questioned the appearance of the granular/powdery substance, expressing his view that the substance should have had a crushed appearance if it had indeed been forced into the pouch containing multiple metal keys.

36     Mr Yasin’s boldest assertion was that he was “_confident that_ (his) _fingerprints will not be found on the packet_” as he had neither touched nor seen the packet before. Notwithstanding this, he allowed for the possibility of his DNA being present on the packet “_because somehow the packet was found in the pouch_”, his DNA “_could have been mixed into it_”.

### The accused’s second Long Statement and Cautioned Statement

37     Given the significance of Mr Yasin’s assertions, his second Long Statement, recorded on 24 October 2018 between 12.39 pm and 1.40pm is reproduced _vebatim_:[^46] below:

> Further statement of Mohamed Yasin Bin Sutoh (identification particulars) taken on 24/10/2018 at 1239 hrs by SSGT Adly at CNB Alpha Interview room

> 14.    Previous statement dated 17/1/2018 was read back to me and I confirm that was the earlier statement that as taken from me.

> 15.    I am now asked again regarding the day of my arrest. It was early that morning when I was spotchecked by plain clothes officers behind the coffee shop. As I mentioned in my previous statement, I was asked to empty my pockets. I did so and put everything in the car boot. There were 3 officers around me . There was a malay officer on my left and my back, A Chinese officer was on my right. All 3 were plain clothes officers. The malay officer on my left was the one who instructed me to empty my belongings. In the front left pocket of my jeans, I have a key pouch holder, I took it out and put it onto the boot. The Chinese officer on my right took it and threw it back onto the car boot and the packet of “Heroin” fell out of the key pouch holder. I was straight away handcuffed.

> 16.    The Chinese officer then removed the keys from my pouch and took a photo of the empty pouch holder. Before that they key pouch was very full and nothing could b e put in. The keys make the bag very tight so there could not be any way to fit anything else into the pouch. Furthermore, if the bag of heroin was squeezed in the pouch, it will definitely be crushed. The packet of ‘Heroin’ is in good form so it is not possible that the packet was inside the pouch holder. When I put the key pouch holder in the car boot, there was no drugs in it but after the Chinese officer took it and put it back into the boot, there was the packet of ‘Heroin’.

> 17.    I would like to say again that the packet of ‘Heroin’ does not belong to me. I have never touched it nor seen the packet before. I am confident that my fingerprints will not be found on the packet. However, somehow the packet was found in the pouch holder, my DNA could have been mixed onto it but that item is still not mine,

> 18.    I am unsure which lane was it that I was being spotchecked. I just know it was behind a coffeeshop and beside an open field.

38     I should add that Mr Yasin’s Cautioned Statement[^47] recorded slightly later at 2.05 pm on the same day, contained a similar reference where he had asserted that “_The item does not belong to me. You can check my fingerprints for_ (sic) _it_”. Mr Yasin also added a claimed that he had been searched by multiple officers, which had distracted him: “_The officers should not have all searched me at the same time because I could not see what the officers were holding when they search. The officer also did not show me his hands before he search_ (sic) _my pouch holder_”.

39     Officer Adly indicated that despite Mr Yasin’s challenge, **_no_** test for fingerprints had been undertaken. Instead, the sachet had been swabbed for DNA traces, and Mr Yasin’s DNA had **_not_** been found. When queried by learned counsel why there had been no attempt to trace for fingerprints, Officer Adly indicated that such tracing was not the standard process for Mr Yasin’s genre of drug possession cases where he had already been found with positive narcotic exhibits on his person. Officer Adly explained that “_during our course of investigation for the denial cases of pos[^48] drug exhibits_... _we usually just send for DNA to see_ (for hits and matches)”[^49]

40     Although not specifically asked in any follow through question, it seemed likely that Officer Adly was, by his response above, relying on the presumptions of possession under section 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, where Mr Yasin had been found with the “_positive drug exhibits_” on his person, and might not have apprehended that Mr Yasin was directly attacking the very premise of the drugs being in his person, which was a constituent requirement for the presumption under section 18 MDA to be applicable. This was because Mr Yasin’s assertion was that Officer Chong had **_planted_** these on his pouch by sleight of hand, while his attention had been divided by focusing on the “three officers” whom he alleged to have been at the scene.

### Accused’s belated assertion of planting does not comport with his earlier Long Statement

41     Given this, and Mr Yasin’s explicit contentions that his prints were on the packet, it would seem, in my view, to have been more prudent to trace for the presence of any prints. I should add however, that the absence of Mr Yasin’s fingerprints would not have been **_determinative_** in any event. There could be any number of scenarios that would have led to there being no prints found. It was also noteworthy that Mr Yasin did not raise this when his first Long Statement was recorded on the afternoon of 17 October 2018, and that this had somehow occurred to him only after a week of DRC remand. It was also highly significant that Mr Yasin had given a very different scenario in the first Long Statement, where he had told the searching officer that the sachet of _diamorphine_ “_might have been given to me by my friend_” but that he could not recall the specific details of this transaction. Further, Mr Yasin had admitted to having consumed _diamorphine_ at about 5.00 pm on 16 October 2018, just under 12 hours from the time he had been accosted by the team of police officers and had lain a comprehensive account leading to his possession of the drugs.

42     The accused had sought to demonstrate that the bag could not have been forced into the pouch as it was not capacious enough to properly enclose the sachet with keys within, and that any squeezing would crush the drugs and cause them to crumble and de-clump, and also break down into powder rather than retain a granular form. When Officer Adly was invited to inspect the packet as well as a contemporaneously taken image, he noted that the substance was in the form of both powder and in granular form. While he could not comment on any crushing also noted the presence of creasing on packet.

## THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE

### Evidence of DW1 Mohamed Yasin Bin Sutoh

43     Upon the administration of the allocution, Mr Yasin elected to give evidence on his own behalf. Mr Yasin was born in 1957 and was thus 63 years of age when he gave his testimony. He had a somewhat limited education, and was formally schooled up to primary three, and claimed not to be able to read and write.[^50] He also purported not to understand English and could only converse in Malay. This did not hinder Mr Yasin from securing employment, as he was employed as a foreman at the time of his arrest.

### DW2, Mutiara was present at the scene but did not witness the search

44     In relation to the events surrounding his search, Mr Yasin’s version differed from Officer Chong’s that the accused had been walking along a path alone. Mr Yasin instead contended that he had been with friends and his companion, a certain Mutiara, at a stall adjacent to 268 Geylang Road at about 1.00 am to 2.00 am, when police officers appeared, and asked to checked the identification documents of the members of their assembly. Of those present, only Mr Yasin was taken to be searched at the back lane behind 268 Geylang Road.[^51] Mr Yasin made the curious contention that he was searched at the back lane for “_a few hours_” after he was accosted by the officers. In his own words[^52]: “_It was estimated around 1:00 to 2:00am that I was arrested at the back lane and only around 4:30am I was brought to the station because we had to wait for the patrol and_ **_I was searched at the back lane for a few hours_**.” This seemed peculiar as Ms Mutiara, who had been at the scene, was not able to give any evidence of his search, despite their being very close, where Mr Yasin would visit her apartment “_probably a few days within a week_”[^53] Ms Mutiara was to subsequently give evidence as DW2, to the effect that she did not witness the search at all. She did recall pleading[^54] with the officers not to detain the accused. While the defence case is that she was advised to leave by the police and Mr Yasin[^55], it seemed inconceivable that she would be so incurious about Mr Yasin’s situation as to not check on him, especially where he was being apparently the subject of a prolonged search ‘_for a few hours_’ at a back line which appeared to be mere **_metres_** from where the party had been.

### The accused’s account included the presence of a third police officer

45     Mr Yasin’s version had the search being conducted at the back lane by three officers. He claimed that **_two_** Malay officers and a single Chinese officer had been present during the search. He also recognised Officer Chong to be the Chinese officer, and had been situated at his right. Mr Yasin recognised Officer Razali as one of the other Malay officers, and placed the police officer to be behind him. The third unknown officer, also of Malay appearance, had been on the left of Mr Yasin.

### The accused’s account of the search

46     The search had, according to the accused, he was asked to ‘_put down_’[^56] is sling bag, and the search started with the contents of his sling bag being examined first. After everything in the sling bag was checked, it was placed on ‘_top of the car_’[^57], which was obviously a reference to the car boot and not the roof of the car. Mr Yasin indicated that the officers were meticulous in that they “_checked everything until there was nothing inside_”. He recalled that the last item to be checked was the key pouch. Mr Yasin’s version had him taking out key pouch on his own accord “_So, the last was my key pouch, I put it on the car”[^58]_. Mr Yasin added that he had put the pouch the car after taking it out of his front left trouser pocket[^59]. At this juncture, Officer Chong had taken the accused’s key pouch away with **_one_** hand but had then put the pouch back on the car with **_two_** hands shortly thereafter[^60]. Mr Yasin had recalled Officer Chong’s exclamation as “_he suddenly said that there were drugs_”.[^61]

### Account of PW3’s peremptory disposal of the accused’s “pills”

47     After Officer Chong had vocalised his finding of ‘_drugs_’ in the pouch, the same police officer was accused by Mr Yasin of perpetrating a bizarre disposal of potential evidence against Mr Yasin. This involved Officer Chong peremptorily throwing away pills that he had found on Mr Yasin’s front left pocket. Essentially the account has Officer Chong handcuff Mr Yasin, question him about the subsequent discovery of the pills, and then throwing them away without further comment. In the accused’s own words, he offered this account to counsel in his evidence-in-chief[^62]:

>   
| 

Accused:

 | 

And then, (Officer Chong) suddenly said that there were drugs. How did the drugs appear? It did not belong to me.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

What happened after that?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

Then he handcuffed me, and then, he said, “What is in your pocket? What pills are there?” **_And then_** **_he_** **_took it, and_** **_he_** **_threw it away_**.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

And, which---okay, which pocket is that?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

It was the front left pocket.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

So, when you say he threw it away, he put it on the boot and then swipe away or he just threw it away?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

**_No, he just took---he picked it up and then he just threw it away_**.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

I see. Do you know why he did that?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

I don’t know.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### PW3’s disposal of ‘pills’ never mentioned in prior statements

48     It should be noted that this was the **_first_** occasion that Mr Yasin had formally given a testimonial account of this peculiar event, although he had presumably briefed counsel on this aspect of his case, as counsel had put it to PW3 that he had summarily disposed of unidentified pills that the officer had allegedly found on his front left short pocket after he had handcuffed Mr Yasin, **_albeit_** that counsel’s version in the put question was **_materially different_** from the one provided by Mr Yasin in his evidence-in-chief. The significance of Officer Chong’s claimed erratic and capricious behaviour in this episode was heightened by Mr Yasin subsequently claiming that the pills were actually ‘_Epam_’.[^63] ‘_Epam_’ incidentally is the common name for the benzodiazepine _nitraz_**_epam_**. Mr Yasin admitted also that he did not have a prescription and had illicitly acquired the prescription drug self-treat his inability to sleep.

### Accused’s claims of PW3’s intentional disregard and disposal of unidentified and unanalysed pills found on him does not sit well with other claim that PW3 planted diamorphine sachet to frame him

49     It would have been a serious dereliction of duty, to say the least, for Officer Chong to have abruptly thrown away the quantity of **_unidentified_** pills recovered from an individual whom he had suspected of harbouring drugs, as the said pills might well have been found to be controlled drugs or contained other contraband substance had they been preserved and presented for a toxicological analysis. It was thus the case that Mr Yasin was, at trial, simultaneous maintaining two diametrically opposed accusations against Officer Chong, the **_first_** being that Officer Chong had **_intentionally planted_** a sachet of granular/powdery substance containing _diamorphine_ in his pouch, while the **_second_** accusation being that the same officer **_deliberately excluded_** taking into custody a collection of suspicious looking pills from a man detained in the early hours of the morning upon an standing warrant for his arrest. This seemed utterly irrational as it would have served Officer Chong’s interest, if the latter had harboured any intent was to cause Mr Yasin to be prosecuted for the possession of narcotics, to have seized the pills for analysis on the possibility that these too might contain narcotic substances.

### Accused had no prior history of dealings with PW3

50     The nature of the allegations made by the accused would beg the question as to whether there was any “_bad blood_” between Mr Yasin and Officer Chong which might conceivably have operated as a source of motivation to frame him with the sachet containing diamorphine, and also in his alleged cavalier treatment of Mr Yasin’s pills. When asked if he had done “_anything to make Officer Chong angry_”, Mr Yasin insisted “_I did not do anything wrong. I did not speak in a harsh way_”,[^64] maintaining that he had been co-operative during the search and had been “_willing to be checked”[^65]_ and that Officer Chong had been wrong to throw his pills away. Mr Yasin added that he had never met PW3 before. The DPP pressed on to query that since Mr Yasin had, by his own admission, **_never_** met Officer Chong before the material date, there was no reason for Officer Chong to behave unfairly against him. The accused prevaricated but could not offer any explanation: [^66]

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

Since you have never met him before there was no reason for Officer Chong to behave unfairly to you, right?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

Maybe he saw me before at Geylang but I do not know him. I usually go to Geylang and I probably think that he may or may not know my name.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

But you don’t know if there’s any reason for him to treat you unfairly, right?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

**_I do not know why it happened like this_**. I feel sad.

 |

  
  

### The accused’s various versions of PW3’s treatment of his pills are profoundly contradictory

51     It should also be noted that the accused eventually gave no fewer than **_three_** disparate versions of this incident from put questions to PW3, at his examination-in-chief and finally during his cross-examination/re-examination. Mr Yasin’s testimonial version involved Officer Chong, **_after cuffing_** the accused, **_then_** noting the presence of the ‘pills’ in the accused person’s left shirt pocket, Took then and flung them on the ground. The version that was put to PW3. presumably premised on accused’s instructions, by counsel was starkly different in that Mr Yasin had, **_on his own volition, taken out the pills_** and put them on the car boot. After he had done so, Officer Chong swept the pills aside off the car. To assist in the juxtaposition, I set out counsel’s own words: [^67]

> Now, according ..,to my client, the accused, …shortly after the drug exhibit which … is in front of you was found, he was also asked by either yourself or one of your colleagues whether he had anything else and his instructions, which I put to you, are that he did---he said that yes, he has something else and **_he took out a slab of pills from …his left shirt pocket and he put it on the boot of the car. When you saw that, you just swept it aside_** on the basis that it’s not important. Do you agree or disagree?

> \[Emphasis added\]

52     On his part, Officer Chong had no impression of such an incident ever having occurred during his search and arrest of Mr Yasin, and that this alleged peremptory disposal at scene was grossly contrary to standard protocol, reiterating that “ _in under no circumstances shall we do that_”[^68], and that all medications and prescription drugs on an accused’s person would be seized and presented to higher authority at headquarters in Geylang for a decision whether a referral to Health Sciences Authority was merited to verify the seized items.

### The different versions of the pill disposal incident are completely irreconcilable

53     While the alleged incident of the peremptory disposal of the pills is not directly connected with the possession charge concerning the _diamorphine_ sachet, a granular examination of an asserted event which is claimed to have occurred within the **_same transaction_** would be necessary where the case revolves around the disparate testimonies of Officer Chong and the accused, and allows an appropriate assessment of the veracity, congruence and consistency of their evidence. To recapitulate, during his evidence-in-chief, the accused’s evidence person said that Sssgt Chong took the pills, which were in the accused person’s shirt pocket, and threw them to the ground.48

54     Returning now to Mr Yasin’s accounts, I would be of the view that the various accounts of the allegation that Officer Chong had thrown his _Epam_ pills, for which Mr Yasin has conceded to not being able to fathom any reason why an officer he had never met would have behaved with such capriciousness, are fundamentally **_irreconcilable_**. To recap once again, Mr Yasin’s direct testimony at EIC is that he had in the course of the search, taken out the **_pouch_** on his own volition and placed it on the car bonnet. Mr Yasin then unequivocally states “_After_ (Officer Chong) _had taken_ (the pouch), **_then_** (Officer Chong) **_handcuffed me_**_._ **_Then_** **_he took the pills that were from my pocket_** _and he threw it away_.” [^69] Counsel Malcolm Tan had instead questioned Officer Chong to “_according to my client_”, that the said officer or another had queried Mr Yasin whether he “_had anything else_”, upon which Mr Yasin had replied in the affirmative that he had “_something else_” and the accused had thereafter “**_taken out a slab of pills from his left shirt pocket_** _and he put it on the boot of the car_.”[^70] The incongruity is obvious; _If Mr Yasin had been_ **_handcuffed_** as he says he was in his evidence-in-chief, he would not be in any position to reach into his pocket to take out the pills. This would be all the more so if he were rear-cuffed, which would be the standard form of restraint for an unknown subject who had just been suspect of a crime, and especially if that had involved the suspected possession of illicit narcotic substances.

### Accused’s further contradictions at re-examination

55     Mr Yasin further confounded this by rendering what appeared to be a third version at re-examination. This would be quite obvious in the reproduction of the exchange between the accused and his counsel below:

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

Now, in Cross-Examination, you were also asked about Mr. Chong and the Epam pills. Right, you remember that?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

Yes, I remember.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

Now, you were asked which one is correct…whether he swept it from the boot or he took it and throw it to the ground.

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

He swept it away.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

So why did you say in Cross-Examination just now that he took it and throw it to the ground or the drain?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

**_He took it and then he swing it and throw it to the ground. I’m not too sure whether you can count it as “swept it away” or throw it away._**

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

So was this Epam on the car boot when he took it and throw it away or not?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

**_I took the Epam out from my pocket and passed it to him._** **_He took it away and he threw it to the ground._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

56     It apparently did not occur to Mr Yasin that his counsel had been trying to address the incongruence arising from his account in his evidence-in-chief and his subsequent evidence, with the latter involving the retrieval of the pills from his pocket by Officer Chong after the accused had been handcuffed. In his final answer, Mr Yasin contradicted his initial testimony at his examination-in-chief and maintained he had taken the pills out himself, which was of course physiologically improbable if he had been handcuffed.

57     While I have severe doubts as to the authenticity of the alleged pill disposal incident, I would expect that Mr Yasin would have been cuffed by the time this incident was alleged to have occurred, which would, from Mr Yasin’s own narration, have been **_after_** the sachet of drugs had been found on him and had been asked if there was “_anything else_” on his person. He would have, by this juncture, assumed the identity of a drug-offence suspect, and treated as such by extant protocols. The passage from the re-examination reproduced above also asserted a **_new_** sequence of motions on the part of Officer Chong, who was now accused of having swept it away, swung it and thrown the pulls to the ground or drain.

### PW3’s peremptory disposal was not raised when statement was recorded

58     The accused person’s post-arrest conduct also did not help his case. There is no reference to this event at all in any of Mr Yasin’s statements set out above. At cross-examination, Mr Yasin confirmed that he had not mentioned the disposal of the pills despite providing an extremely detailed statement in relation to his procurement and consumption of _panas_ or _diamorphine_, _methamphetamine_, “_Epam_” tables and even his sourcing of diabetes medication in his first statement which was recorded by Officer Badawi, but never referenced Officer Chong having capriciously thrown away his pill, rather than sequester and secure them for investigations.

### Accused gave differing accounts of the roles played by PW1 and PW3 in the recovery of the pouch in the course of his testimony

59     Returning now to the key pouch and the sachet of granular/powdery substance at the heart of the possession charge, Mr Yasin gave divergent accounts of the roles that Officer Razali and Officer Chong played during the time of his search and arrest, in particular the recovery of pouch, with his accounts evolving over different points of the trail. To recapitulate from PW1’s account, Officer Razali did not have any clear recollection of the event, and he surmised that the circumstances of Mr Yasin’s search and arrest had been so uneventful that nothing had stood out to jot his memory, with no extraordinary occurrence which would have distinguished it from the many such procedures that he had administered in the same period. He was however specific that he would principally play a passive role to keep an eye on the searched individual and give verbal prompts to the suspect to pay attention to all items taken out as the search progressed, while Officer Chong conducted the active physical task of searching. Put simply, Officer Razali’s evidence was that he never searched Mr Yasin at all.

60     Mr Yasin had claimed that Officer Razali had, contrary to the protocol that the prosecution witness described, **_directly_** searched Mr Yasin’s belongings from his backpack while he was behind the accused, while maintaining his claim that there had been three officers at the scene [^71]:

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

And it was Officer Ahmad (_Razali_) who searched your belongings?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

**_Yes, correct_**.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

Mr. Yasin, what you’re saying today cannot be true, because how is it possible for Officer Ahmad to do that search from behind you?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

**_Yes, he was behind me, and he did the search behind me_**, because in front of me, there was the car boot. On my right, there’s another officer, behind me was Mr. Ahmad, and on the left, it’s another officer.

 |

  
  

61     Mr Yasin conceded did not initially surrender the black key pouch. He agreed with the DPP’s challenge that “_It was only when_ **_Officer Chong_** _patted you down and found that there was still something in the front right pocket of your jeans that you took out the black key pouch, am I right?” with a response that “it was the last item. It was in my pocket. The other items that were in the back, I have already surrendered it over_.”[^72] The learned DPP was careful to repeat the question to elicit a direct answer, and Mr Yasin had finally confirmed his answer about Officer Chong’s retrieval of the pouch.

62     Mr Yasin did, however, during learned counsel’s re-examination, take an entirely different tack in claiming that it was instead Officer Razali who had found the pouch that he had not declared. His account had Officer Razali who was standing behind him, first searching his bag (which again, was contrary to the protocol of only one officer conducting the search). Thereafter, **_Officer Razali_** had taken the additional step of checking Mr Yasin’s pocket and found the pouch. After Officer Razali had detected the pouch, the accused had taken the key pouch out, it was Officer Chong who had seized the pouch from the accused person. This was the sequence of events according to Mr Yasin[^73]

>   
| 

Counsel:

 | 

Right. So based on what you are saying, so what the DPP put to you never happened, that (_Officer_) Chong patted you and it was only then that you brought out the pouch---the key pouch?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

**_No_**, (_Officer_) **_Chong has nothing got to do with this search_**_. (Officer)_ Ahmad was the only one who searched me. I took out the pouch and then Chong took it away.

 |
| 

Counsel

 | 

When you say you took out the pouch, did you take out the pouch when you were asked to produce, uh, everything---to surrender anything, or did you take out the pouch only when you were patted down and someone found it on you. By pouch is I mean the key holder.

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

**_They_** searched the bag first and then after which **_they_** checked my pockets which I told them that there is my wallet and also the key pouch holder. And then I took the key pouch holder out from my pocket and then (_Officer_) Chong took it away from me.

 |

  
  

63     The passage shows Mr Yasin contradict himself within the space of two questions. He had tried to emphasize that Officer Razali had been the one searching him, with Officer Chong having “**_nothing to do with this search_**”. It was Officer Razali who had traced the form of the key pouch, and that he, Mr Yasin, had volunteered information on the presence of his wallet and key pouch. It was only after he had taken out the pouch that Officer Chong had taken the pouch from the accused.

64     As can be seen from the reproduced passage of the trial transcript, the accused unaccountably changes his version of the search by making a reference in the plural that ‘_they_’ had searched the bag first and ‘_they_’ had checked his pockets, suggesting that the officers had broken protocol and simultaneously searched both his bag and his pockets. The impression was thus that Mr Yasin was not making any real attempt to recall what had happened, but seemed rather, from his hops and skips under questioning, to be weaving a concocted narrative, ‘_on the fly’_ metaphorically speaking, to single-mindedly _segue_ to a point where Officer Chong allegedly seizes the pouch, allowing a window of opportunity to make the surreptitious insertion of the sachet of granular/powdery substance, which was the cornerstone of Mr Yasin’s defence.

### Evidence of DW2, Mutiara

65     Ms Mutiara, whose name did not include a surname or other family name, informed the court that she was a permanent resident, and worked as a massage therapist and reflexologist in Pasir Ris, and having lived in Singapore for 18 years, could speak simple English. She claimed her relationship with Mr Yasin to be platonic in nature, treating him as a brother, whom she fittingly called “_Abang_”. She had known the accused for some two years, and had arranged to meet on the night of his arrest, as it was her birthday. She stated that Mr Yasin had bought her a mobile phone as her birthday gift at a phone shop near Geylang Lorong 20 11.00 pm that night. The duo had a drink then went to Geylang Lorong 15 to meet his friends at a coffee shop. She recalled the company to be some six or seven persons.

66     At some point, Ms Mutiara had taken a comfort break at a toilet across the road, and returned to the party, to find that ‘three or four’ police officers in _mufti_ were at the scene and checking the identification documents of the attendees. She only recognised a Malay officer, who had assisted her when she had been the victim of a snatch theft. Mr Yasin was the only one among them to be asked to accompany the plainclothes policemen, and he had been taken down a sloped passage where a police car had been parked. Ms Mutiara had run after the officers to ask them to release Mr Yasin on account on her celebrating her birthday[^74]. The officers stated that they were unable to accede to her request, and also rejected her entreaties to be his guarantor, with an assurance that he would give himself in the next day. A “_Malay or Indian_” officer had told Ms Mutiara in Malay to go home, and she “_went home straightaway_”. [^75] She has also elaborated that the police officer had told her that if she did not return, he would “_bring you all together_”. She interpreted this to be a caution not to obstruct police officers while they were working.[^76] The accused himself had admonished her to return home as she had work the next day. Given that she had not seen the search, Ms Mutiara’s evidence was limited applicability, and she appeared to have been called to corroborate Mr Yasin’s contention that the police had come closer to midnight rather than at past 4.00 am, and also that there had been more than two officers.

67     I found Ms Mutiara’s evidence in simply leaving the scene to “(go) _home straightway_” quite peculiar, given her asserted closeness to Mr Yasin, and her earlier impassioned entreaties to the police officer, that she did not linger any longer at the scene. It was her own evidence that the police car had been parked in an open public area, and it had been open for her to look on from a distance, which could not be construed as her causing any “_obstruction_” of police work. Ms Mutiara was not a new immigrant, and thus likely to be _au fait_ with local laws and the general standing of the police force. She has also been in Singapore for a full 18 years, and would not have likely been intimidated by the police officers, one of whom had assisted her when she was the victim of a crime, and made the effort to converse with her in Malay.

68     Hence, her testimony, aside from a bid to corroborate the two tangential details of the defence’s case of the timing of the incident and number of officers, Ms Mutiara had little impact in bolstering Mr Yasin’s version of the events, or his case theory for sabotage. This is especially where the one officer who was noted by her to be curt and high-handed with a warning in Malay, was not Officer Chong, who was the central figure in Ms Yasin’s defence that the sachet was planted. It would also be the case that, aside from her bare statements in oral testimony, she had not been able to back her assertions of the time of the incident or the number of officers being ‘_three or four’_. There was no date or time stamped photo of their celebrations (which would not be unlikely if she had indeed been celebrating her birthday) or any other witness from the party of ‘six or seven; celebrants coming forward.

## ANALYSIS

69     Given that this case essentially turns on the testimonial evidence of the accused and the two officers who had searched Mr Yasin, it would be apposite to examine and weigh their respective testimonies for internal and external consistency, and juxtapose against the documentary evidence in the form of the Long Statements recorded. An appropriate touch-stone for undertaking this analysis would be to refer to _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>; <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGHC 333</span> where the High Court divided the taxonomy for the assessment of a witness’ credibility in three domains (at \[9\] of the judgment):

> 9    A judge can make a finding on the credibility of a witness based on some or all of the following:

>> (a)    (The witness’s) **_demeanour_**.

>> (b)    The **_internal consistency_** (or lack thereof) in the content of (the witness’s) evidence.

>> (c)    The **_external consistency_** (or lack thereof) between the content of the evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

### Accused’s wavering in his accounts as a stark contrast to PW3’s coherence

70     While Mr Yasin’s non-verbal demeanour could not be recorded in the transcript, his vacillations were all too obvious on the record. A clear example would be his own account in his evidence-in-chief, of having **_voluntaril_**_y_ yielded the black pouch, in what I would interpret as a bid to demonstrate that he would not have expected the pouch to harbour any untoward articles. Mr Yasin was forced to make a grudging shift in his position upon close cross-examination when he had conceded, upon the learned DPP’s close questioning that he had waited till the frisk-search when “_Officer Chong patted_ (him) down _and found that there was still something in the front right pocket of_ (his) _jeans_”[^77] that he had taken the pouch out. Mr Yasin’s lack of internal consistency was in full play when the identity of the searching officer **_shifted_** to instead be Officer Razali at his re-examination, when (to recap) “_Officer Chong has nothing to do with this search_”[^78].

71     By this narrative, Officer Chong had momentarily seized the pouch when Mr Yasin removed it, and then allegedly palmed the sachet of granular/powdery to incriminate Mr Yasin. To say the least, the manoeuvre he had tried to attribute to the officer would have required an improbable level of quick thinking and manual dexterity on the part of Officer Chong. In that instant after he gained custody of the item, the officer would have to been able to formulate such a plan, and, at the same time, have a sachet of _diamorphine_, with the correct dimensions to fit the pouch, at hand, and the alacrity to execute the move in the presence of another officer (or two more officers, according to Mr Yasin) at the scene, assuming that no other officer was complicit in the scheme.

72     In contrast, learned counsel was afforded a chance to peruse Officer Chong’s contemporaneous self-recorded statement which he had recorded at the scene, and noted its consistency with PW3’s oral evidence at trial stating “_It is more or less consistent with what he says_**.**”[^79] Counsel did not propose to include that statement as an exhibit.

### Accused’s account of planting of the sachet is totally incongruous with both of his Long Statements

73     Mr Yasin’s accounts were discrepant with **_both_** his Long Statements, with the inconsistency being especially glaring with his first statement. In relation to later statement, Mr Yasin rendered two entirely new versions in his oral testimony (as documented above) from his second Long Statement. These versions where either Officer Chong frisks him and finds the pouch, or seizes the pouch from Officer Razali to allegedly plant the sachet contradict his own second Long Statement recorded on 24 October 2018[^80].

74     In the second Long Statement, recorded a week after his arrest, Mr Yasin stated _“I took_ (the pouch_) out and put it onto the boot. The Chinese officer on my right took it and threw it back onto the car boot and the packet of “Heroin” fell out of the key pouch holder_.”[^81] The accused clearly identified asserted that **he** had himself placed the pouch onto the car boot, and Officer Chong had taken the pouch thrown it back onto the car boot, upon which the sachet “_fell out_” of the pouch, which appeared to be an explicit acknowledgment that the sachet had been **_enclosed within_** the pouch.

75     When counsel re-examined him, Mr Yasin had sought to disavow this statement, despite his aligning the statement with a rather feeble denial professing ignorance of his own statement’s contents even though it had been read back to him in the Malay language[^82]:

>   
| 

Accused:

 | 

I do not know why I signed this statement. I do not understand much about this statement.

 |
| 

Counsel:

 | 

Right, I suppose since you say this, can you explain to His Honour how this statement was recorded? …Was it read back to you in the Malay language before you signed it?

 |
| 

Accused

 | 

**_Yes. This statement was read back to me in Malay however, I do not know what was written in the statement_**. So, I have no idea whether what was stated is correct.

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Accused likely had no explanation for the discrepancies between his court testimony and his second Long Statement

76     It was thus the case that when he was asked about the contradictory accounts at re-examination, Mr Yasin took the odd position to profess ignorance of the contents of the second Long Statement. As the statement had been read to him in Malay, this position seemed untenable. From his demeanour and language, I interpreted his response to be born of a desire to disengage from answering the question, as there was simply no cogent explanation for the discrepancies.

### The accused’s specific admissions regarding the sachet of diamorphine in his First Statement

77     Mr Yasin’s first Long Statement, recorded some 12 hours after his arrest, was even more problematic for his case The two salient passages would be \[3\] and \[13\] of the that statement, which must stand as the most contemporaneous documentation of the case. At \[3\] he stated:

> … The officer asked if I had anything illegal to declare and I emptied all of my bags onto a car boot. I also emptied all of my pockets and place my items on the car boot. The officer then picked up the key pouch that I had placed on the car boot and held it in his hands. **_When he placed it on the car boot again, there was 01 packet containing ‘Heroin’._** The officer asked me who it belongs to and I told him that I do not know who it belongs to and that the item does not belong to me. **_I told the officer that it might have been given to me by my friend but I cannot remember_**, after that I was placed under arrest. I was then escorted to Bedok Police Division.

78     Mr Yasin does of course have a nascent denial that the item did not belong to him but as indicated above, it is still intriguing that Mr Yasin **_knew_** the item was _diamorphine_ (using the vernacular term “_Heroin_” here) and also when he stated again at \[12\] that ‘_The item is 01 packet of ‘Panas’. It does not belong to me_.” This was of course long before the issuance of any test result by the Heath Sciences Authority confirming the granular/powdery substance to contain _diamorphine_.

### Accused’s explanation that the sachet might have been given to him by ‘a friend’ is adverse to his case

79     It is also particularly damaging for Mr Yasin’s case that at the first opportunity that he was allowed to formally explain his situation, he had offered an explanation that the sachet found in the pouch might have been a gift to him from a friend, though circumstances he could no longer recall, to accompany the bare denial that the sachet was his own. There is no reason why he would have held back from explicitly setting out his subsequent accusation that Officer Chong had planted the sachet in his pouch, although he alludes to Officer Chong handling the pouch, and his claimed surprise that a “_packet containing ‘Heroin_”[^83] had been found.

### PW3 able to recall the accused attributing the sachet to either a purchase or acquired from ‘a friend’

80     It is notable, in juxtaposition, that while Officer Brandon’s recall was not eidetic, he could still remember the exchange with the accused to go along the lines of a prior acquisition either from a purchase or from a friend:[^84]

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

Now, what did he say in---in reply to your question about the packet?

 |
| 

PW3:

 | 

Uh, to be exact, I cannot commit exactly which part he say but it was along this line that, … in Malay, “What is this?” And he would say that this is …as they call panas, …in Malay …which is hot substances as we term it to be heroin. Uh, if they say “sejuk”, cold it would be Ice. That is how we …decipher what they are speaking about. So, when we reaffirm to him that, “You say it’s panas, so …**_I would assume it’s heroin. Uh, am I right?” “Uh, yes, but, uh, it’s not mine. I bought it from somewhere.” Can’t remember what he said, either a friend or he bought it from someone_**.

 |
| 

{Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Prosecution’s submission on improbability that the accused could not recall the alleged planting of the sachet

81     DPP Sunil Nair had also made these valid observations in his written submissions[^85] in relation to Mr Yasin failing to state his case that the sachet was planted by Officer Chong, with an explicit concession that no reference was made at all to the recording officer:

> 43    Notably, the accused person did not claim that Officer Chong had planted Packet. It is an extremely serious matter for a police officer to plant drugs and frame an innocent person. It is not the sort of fact that would be forgotten or omitted due to poor recollection. There is no mention of this startling allegation in the 1st Long Statement.

> 44    Unsurprisingly, the accused person accepted during cross-examination that the 1st Long Statement does not contain allegations of wrongdoing by Officer Chong because the accused person did not mention it at all to the recording officer, Ahmad Badawi Bin Abubakar Bagarib.

### Accused’s affirmation of disclosure to recoding officer that the sachet and its contents could have come from “a friend”

82     While cross-examined by the learned DPP at trial, Mr Yasin did not deny that he had told **Officer Badawi**[^86] that the sachet could have been given to him by his friend, but he could not remember the circumstances behind this, responding affirmatively “_Yes, I told him_”.

### Accused’s reason for not opening up to recording officer of alleged planting of the sachet

83     When re-examined by his own counsel as to his failure to mount his accusation against Officer Chong on the recording of his First Long Statement, Mr Yasin responded with the curious contention that he “_was not asked_”[^87]. When his own counsel pressed for a more coherent response on why he had instead told Officer Badawi about the possibility that the sachet had come from a friend, counsel’s efforts met with an even more peculiar response when the accused response that “_I don’t know. I was blur at that point of time and I was speechless. I was speechless’_[^88]. When pressed again by counsel, who evidently realised the pivotal nature of his response on the accused’s credibility, Mr Yasin cryptically claimed that “_I would not want to create stories_” and he had the impression that if “_I want to explain things further it is best that I explain it to my Counsel and also to the Court._”, which appeared to be a belief that he would be allowed to explain his defence in his own time, in due course, once he had a counsel on board and the case had proceeded to trial.

84     Mr Yasin concluded with what seemed a cynical observation that “_Furthermore, Mr. Badawi is also a policeman and likewise Mr. Chong_.”[^89] Implicit in this was that his revelation of Officer Chong’s actions to Officer Badawi would be a futile gesture as they were in the same profession and would inevitably side each other. It is not clear if Mr Yasin understood that Officer Badawi was actually a CNB officer while Officer Chong was from the police force, and hence not colleagues in any sense. Mr Yasin’s professed scepticism about the partiality of law enforcement officers cannot be any acceptable response for his failure to declare the alleged planting of the sachet at the earliest opportunity.

85     Similarly, with Mr Yasin’s life experience as a sexagenarian Singaporean, it would have quite obvious that his withholding essential details of his defence until he had counsel on board, or until the matter proceeded for trial, would have made his defence open to suspicion that any belated assertions were contrived afterthoughts. Likely pursuant to Mr Yasin’s brief, learned counsel had sought to put it to Officer Badawi that Mr Yasin had been “_very tired and he was not completely himself_” when the first Long Statement was recorded. Officer Badawi denied this and categorically noted that the accused “_did not seem tired or drowsy_”.[^90] Mr Yasin alleged at trial that he had been tired when the first Long Statement had been recorded but admitted that he had never told Officer Badawi of this[^91]. In any case, Officer Badawi had indeed asked if Mr Yasin had been comfortable to give his statement, and only proceeded when told by the accused that he was.[^92] The bottom line is that Mr Yasin **_never_** offered any rational explanation for his reference that the sachet could have come from a friend in his first Long Statement.

### The accused’s admission that he had consumed “Heroin” the day before his arrest in his first Long Statement and subsequent attempts to elide

86     Mr Yasin’s admission that he had taken diamorphine the day before his arrest, and his subsequent attempts to backtrack should be seen in the context of certain preliminary positive results from the Instant Urine Test (“IUT”) taken prior to his interview with Officer Badawi, where the IUT results were made known to him.

87     Before going further, I should add that the fact of Mr Yasin’s **_consumption_** of _diamorphine_ would not, of itself, inextricably connect to his **_possession_** charge in respect of the sachet found to contain _diamorphine_. Nevertheless, a person who has been found to have consumed the **_same_** drug for which he also faced a possession charge might naturally find himself under greater circumstantial suspicion, given the projected **_recency_** from the time he had likely last **_handled_** the same drug he had been found to **_consumed._**

88     For Mr Yasin, what was striking was his change of position, with a confession that he had consumed _diamorphine_ a day before his arrest when shown a positive IUT result by Officer Badawi, with his subsequent contention at trial that he had only consumed _diamorphine_ at a much earlier date. The latter was a position taken after the preliminary IUT test which was positive for _diamorphine_ did **_not_** “pan out” in Health Sciences Authority’s more advanced drug-assay analyses to officially confirm the presence of _diamorphine_ within the cut off ranges, and scientific tolerances established.

89     Officer Badawi had demonstrated his mode for eliciting a response in court by showing the drug suspect before him the IUT result and requesting a response as to why the IUT had yielded a positive result for a particular drug, with an obvious query as to when the drug suspect had last consumed the drug in question. From his account, Mr Yasin had been extremely effusive in volunteering information of his last consumption, followed by an account of where and how he had obtained the drug in question. To recapitulate, Mr Yasin had yielded the following information in his first Long Statement[^93] with the areas of subsequent challenge highlighted :

> 7.    I am now being asked why my urine tested positive for Opiate. The reason why my urine tested positive for Opiate is because I smoke I relapsed to smoking ‘Panas’. I refer to ‘Panas’ as ‘Heroin’. **_The last time I smoke ‘Panas’ was on 16/10/2018 at about 1700hrs_**. I smoke ‘Panas’ alone. I smoke at the toilet of the coffee shop located near Geylang Lorong 23. I do not know the name of the coffee shop. I will put the ‘Panas’ on a piece of aluminium foil. I will then use a lighter to burn the bottom of the aluminium foil. Once there is fumes, I will use a rolled-up paper to inhale the fumes. The first puff I did not feel anything. I will not feel anything after smoking ‘Panas’ At 01 time I will smoke about 06 puffs of ‘Panas’. I will only smoke ‘Panas’ on occasions or when I feel like it. The reason why I relapsed to smoking ‘Panas’ is because I wanted to just try the feeling again**_._** **_I relapsed to smoking ‘Panas’ about 01 month ago_**.

> 8\. I get my ‘Panas’ from a male Malay near Geylang Lorong 27. I walked past that area before and I always saw him standing around that area. I then approached him if he had any ‘Panas’, He told me he has and **_I asked him for SGD$10 of ‘Panas_**” do not know his name or contact number

\[Emphasis added\]

### Revised position taken at trial

90     It is notable that Mr Yasin did not seek to revise his position when he appeared before another CNB officer, Officer Adly for his second Long Statement, where he had given his account suggesting that a “_Chinese officer_” had planted the sachet. This was of course just a week after his first statement, and well before the HSA results were available. Mr Yasin would only claim at trial that his last occasion of consuming _diamorphine_ was **_a month_** before his arrest. This was a plain contradiction from his admission of consumption of _‘Panas_’ at 5.00pm on 16 October 2018, mere hours before his arrest in the early hours of 17 October 2018.

91     Further, where Mr Yasin claimed at trial that his last **_consumption_** was a month from his arrest, this was also contrary to the account set out in his statement, which unequivocally records his first **_relaps_****_e_** one month before the arrest on 17 October 2018. There is little room to inveigle any plea of misapprehension that he had meant to state his final consumption as opposed to first relapse to have occurred a month before his arrest, as the latter statement can be found several sentences away from his confession of consumption on 16 October 2018. Further the preceding statements were contextually relevant as a lead up to his account of relapse, as they explained his motivation to “_just try the feeling again_”. I have reproduced the entire passage to show the sheer breadth of detail, which would tend to show Mr Yasin seeming to be very effusive in ‘coming clean’ on his _diamorphine_ consumption, at a time when the preliminary IUT had given an indication of this. Mr Yasin has also disputed saying that he had bought ‘_Panas_’ from a man in Geylang for $10, arguing that it should cost at least $20 at trial. This seems a trivial detail which would have little bearing in the consideration of his positional shift of the date of his last consumption, after learning that there had been no positive finding by the HSA of _diamorphine_ consumption despite the positive IUT result.

92     All in all, Mr Yasin’s positional shift seemed to be predicated on an opportunistic motive when the eventual HSA analysis results did not show that he had consumed _diamorphine_. This much was evident by the fact that he did not dispute his consumption of _diamorphine_ on the evening before his arrest until the HSA results were known. There is also evident by the fact that he did not dispute any other aspect of the IUT results from other drugs, which were recorded in the same sitting and an identical format. Hence, Mr Yasin never disputed statements recorded over his procurement and consumption of drugs pertaining to the other listed IUT pharmacopoeic genera of “_Amphetamines_” and “_Benzodiazepines_”.

93     In respect of the former, the HSA _did_ return a positive result for which he eventually agreed to enter a plea of guilt for an LT1 charge for _methamphetamine_ consumption. For the latter, he faced no prosecutorial consequences. Mr Yasin’s prevarication on his final consumption fundamentally shakes the internal consistency of his case, and his selective attack of just the parts of his statement relating to _diamorphine_ consumption and possession smack of an expediency which, under any objective analysis, must undermine his credibility. As the learned DPP aptly states in his written submissions[^94]:

> It is all too convenient that the accused person is taking issue with only the paragraphs relating to his consumption of Heroin the day before his arrest. **_There is no conceivable reason for Officer Badawi to insert untrue facts relating to just one of the three drugs into the accused person’s statement_**.

> Furthermore, the contents of the 1st Long Statement were read back to the accused person a week later when the 2nd Long Statement was recorded. **_Even though the accused person had the presence of mind to make serious allegations about Officer Chong in the 2nd Long Statement, he made no clarifications to the paragraphs relating to his consumption of Heroin_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Findings on accuracy of \[7\] and \[8\] of the first Long Statement

94     In the premises, and having had the opportunity to observe the demeanour and assess the constancy of the accounts of Officer Badawi and the accused, I am satisfied that Officer Badawi faithfully recorded Mr Yasin’s statements in respect of \[7\] to \[8\] of the first Long Statement, and his belated assertion of his last _diamorphine_ consumption having occurred a month before his arrest is suspect, and seemed a contrivance to avoid the inevitable, if indirect, connection between his admitted consumption of _diamorphine_ in the evening of 16 October 2018 , and that which was found upon his arrest just under 12 hours later. I would also agree on there being a necessary associative inference, but perhaps not to the direct and absolute extent as expressed by the learned DPP which he sought to be drawn in his written submissions, given the accused’s caveats at \[3\] and \[12\] of the same Long Statement[^95]:

> The fact that the accused person consumed Heroin alone in a coffee shop in Geylang the evening before his arrest corroborates his knowing possession of the Packet containing the Drugs at the time of the search.

### The accused’s evidence suffered a lack of extrinsic consistency

95     Mr Yasin’s contentions also did not fare well in the area of extrinsic consistency, with their key plank on the spatial limitations of the black pouch being demonstrated to be patently untenable. To recap, Mr Yasin had sought to argue that the sachet of granular/powdery substance could not be accommodated into the pouch when it was packed with the keys the accused typically carried, and Officer Chong had, by sleight of hand, simply slapped the sachet against the key pouch and thrown the two items together onto the car bonnet to make it appear as if the sachet had emanated from the pouch. This notion was debunked by a practical demonstration which showed that the pouch was still sufficiently capacious as to allow an object with equivalent dimensions of the sachet to be accommodated within, even when the pouch contained its full complement of keys.[^96] To keep things in perspective, it should be recalled that the **_quantity_** of granular/ powdery substance involved did not exceed two grams.

96     Mr Yasin had also claimed that the drugs in the sachet could not have regained their granular form if they had been kept in the pouch. With respect, there did not seem to be any scientific or clinical basis to base his assertion, it was a fact that the drugs, when examined at trial, were in a mixed powdery **_and_** granular form, and appeared to have maintained this state from the time of their seizure to the point they were produced in court. The fact that they still maintained this granular/powdery form despite some inevitable handling and the effluxion of considerable time made it all the more unlikely that their containment in Mr Yasin’s pouch would have caused sufficient degradation as to reduce the entire contents to powdery form. Mr Yasin’s hypothesis was further debunked by the discovery of the existence of folded crease-like marks, when the sachet was examined in the course of Officer Chong’s cross-examination.[^97] Officer Chong identified a number of fold lines on the sachet, which suggested that the sachet packet could have been crumpled and subject to some pressure, creating the distinct imprints on the plastic material. This would be consistent with the sachet being compressed within the relatively congested confines of the pouch, holding its full complement of keys. I should also add that Mr Yasin’s allegations that Officer Chong had peremptorily thrown away his “_Epam_” pills dented his credibility as this would have been an act proscribed by police procedures for searching individuals and the conveyance of all suspected items for identification and analysis. I found it profoundly unlikely that Officer Chong would have acted with such lawless abandon in the presence of at least one other police officer looking on (this would apply _a fortiori_ in the instance of Mr Yasin’s claim that there were actually two other officers at the scene.)

### Prosecution’s case had intrinsic and extrinsic consistency

97     I am satisfied that Officer Chong; the prosecution’s principal witness was entirely consistent. It is an integral point to note that Officer Chong did **_not_** know Mr Yasin at all, nor did the accused have any clear impression of having met Mr Chong. Mr Yasin’s planting scenario, which presupposed a level of premeditation and setting of the opportunity to target him, had to overcome the fact that there had been ample probable cause to stop and search him. The stoppage had occurred when he was seen while Officers Chong and Razali were patrolling in an unmarked car travelling along Geylang Road at under 20 km/h when they spotted the accused person in the early pre-dawn hours of 17 October 2018, walking along the five-foot way in in front of 268 Geylang Road. It would have been wholly legitimate for police officers on a crime control patrol to approach Mr Yasin to check on him.

98     The search itself had been predicated from Mr Yasin having an outstanding warrant at the time in respect of matrimonial proceedings. Specifically, the accused had been sought by the Warrant Enforcement Unit for failing to comply court order concerning his divorce. Given the standing warrant, there were good grounds to conduct a search on Mr Yasin.

99     Officer Chong had conducted the search before a flat and wide surface, which would allow the items from the accused’s person to be lain. He thus recalled asking Mr Yasin to move to one of the tables beside 268 Geylang Road or to the boot of their unmarked police vehicle.

100    In relation to the search procedure, I am satisfied that the search had been conducted _per_ standing procedures put in place to ensure transparency of process and rebut assertions of impropriety. I accepted Officer Chong’s testimony that the accused person was first asked to empty his bag as well as his pockets with the contents lain on the car. Upon seeing Mr Yasin apparently complete this process, Officer Chong asked Mr Yasin he had anything to declare before moving on to undertake the “_frisk_” search.

101    I also accept Officer Chong’s evidence that prior to the search being conducted, Mr Yasin had not made any declaration, and the officer had proceeded to conduct the frisk search. At a point, Officer Chong had made tactile contact with an object, which transpired to be the pouch, in Mr Yasin’s front right trouser pocket. When Officer Chong had queried Mr Yasin as to his failure to declare the presence of the pouch but not met with a response.

102    Further, I accept that Officer Chong had proceeded to take the black pouch out of Mr Yasin’s front right trouser pocket and placed it on either the table or the car boot of the unmarked police car, alongside Mr Yasin’s other belongings. Per his testimony, Officer Chong had checked lain-out items systemically, beginning with the largest, which was the accused’s sling bag, and moving progressively to the smaller items. The police officer reserved the black key pouch as the last item to be fully searched as he was mindful that Mr Yasin had not volunteered its presence or spontaneously taken it out, when he had asked. Officer Chong had purposefully checked it as the final item as he wanted to allow Mr Yasin time to “_digest what is going on_” and ensure he had time “_to think it_ (through)”[^98]which I interpreted to be the notion of “_coming clean_”. Notably, Officer Chong was able to articulate a detailed and textured testimony, where he explained his thought processes. This was in stark contrast with Mr Yasin’s testimony when he found himself entangled with irreconcilably contradictory accounts.

103    Officer Chong had found, upon opening the pouch, the sachet of granular/powdery brown substance its middle compartment. Officer Chong had inquired to find out where the source came from and been told as follows. “_At that point of moment, accused actually admitted to me that it was, uh, heroin. I did not state whether what substance it was, merely saying that it was a brown powdery substance. He replied on his own it was heroin._”[^99] Officer Chong also clarified that Mr Yasin had used the vernacular term of “_Panas_” at points when he had referred to the “heroin” or _diamorphine_. When Officer Chong had proceeded to ask the accused who he had bought the drugs, Mr Yasin had said that the contents of the Ziploc sachet were not his, and that he had obtain this from “_either a friend or he bought it from someone_.”[^100] I found Officer Chong’s account reliable because his version of events cohered with what Officer Badawi had recorded just 12 hours after Mr Yasin’s arrest where he had informed that “_I told the officer that it might have been given to me by my friend but I cannot remember_”. Moreover Officer Chong weathered detailed cross-examination and his evidence remained unshaken.

### Officer Chong’s evidence comported with both testimonial and physical evidence introduced by the prosecution

104    Officer Chong’s evidence thus was that there had been a basis to investigate a person found walking along in the wee hours of the morning, and who had upon being stopped been indeed found to be wanted by the Warrant Enforcement Unit. The standard procedure had been to conduct a search, which had uncovered a key pouch, which in turn contained sachet of granular/powdery substance in a space containing a full complement of keys. Officer Chong simply followed procedure to seize the exhibits and arrested the accused person. This was entirely consistent with Officer Razali’s evidence of never recalling any event where Officer Chong had departed from procedure, and that while not being able to specifically recall encountering Mr Yasin amidst many other arrests, was able to remember that his role was to keep an eye on the accused person while the searching officer undertook the active search of the person of interest. Officer Razali categorically indicated that he did not touch the accused, as that would be contrary to protocol. The physical evidence, specifically the sachet also showed clear crease lines, suggesting that it had been kept in a tight space at some point. There was also no doubt that the sachet could be accommodated into the pouch. With the full complement of keys, there would be a level of compressive pressure, which would likely have, in my view, yielded the compression lines etched onto the sachet.

### In juxtaposition, the accused’s case was contradictory and lacked coherence

105    Mr Yasin’s competing narrative, which comprised a number of disparate accounts of the crucial aspects of his stoppage, search and Officer Chong’s extraordinary post drug discovery/seizure conduct was an amorphous and unconjugated mass of assertions which were ultimately contradicted each other. As obvious examples, Mr Yasin’s first Long Statement where he had mused on the possibility that a friend had given him the sachet was irreconcilable with his evidence in court of Officer Chong planting the same sachet. Even within his evidence at trial Mr Yasin also gave starkly different accounts was to which of the police officers had searched him in the lead-up to the discovery of the sachet. Moreover, Mr Yasin’s account of Officer Chong peremptorily disposing of his “_Epam”_ tablets at the scene beggared belief. Put simply, it did not make sense for Officer Chong to seek to frame Mr Yasin on the one hand by planting a sachet containing powdered _diamorphine_, but heedlessly dispose of unidentified tablets **_actually_** in Mr Yasin’s possession, which could have been a source to incriminate him upon their properly being placed in custody and analysed. Given the above, I was of the view that Mr Yasin’s account lacked both internal and external consistency.

### The accused person’s various shifts in position on whether the sachet had originated from his pouch

106    While it was unfortunate that Officer Adly did not send the sachet for an analysis to test for the presence of fingerprints upon Mr Yasin’s request, Mr Yasin’s position was not an unqualified assertion that there would be **_absolutely no_** forensic trace from him on the sachet. In his second Long Statement, Mr Yasin merely stated that he was confident that his **_fingerprints_** would not be found on the packets, he had however hedged against the possible finding of traces of **_DNA_** matching his profile in the sachet, which was quite evident in this statement that “_However, somehow, that packet was found in my key pouch holder. My DNA could have been mixed onto it, but that item is still not mine._”

107    There are two essential points in this statement. The first would be Mr Yasin’s hedging about the possibility of his DNA being found on the sachet would not be at all necessary if he had been certain that Officer Chong had placed the sachet on the pouch by sleight of hand when the latter had allegedly slapped the pouch onto the car boot revealing the sachet next to the pouch. This asserted act would entail, at most, a mere **_momentary surface contact_** between the two objects, and ought not, even from a layperson’s perspective, cause such a concern of DNA transfer as to motivate the accused to caveat his response in such a cryptic and convoluted manner to the effect of “_even-if -my-DNA-is-there, it-isn’t-mine_”.

108    The more significant point is Mr Yasin’s concession at the time that “_However, somehow_, **_that packet was found_** **_in_** **_my key pouch holder_**_’_, which pointed to Mr Yasin not contesting the presence of the sachet **_within_** the pouch at the time of the search, and the discovery of the item. The presence of the packet being enclosed **_within_** the pouch is also evident in Mr Yasin’s assertion in the same statement that “_As soon as I put the key pouch holder onto the boot, the Chinese officer on my right took it and threw it back onto the car boot_ **_and the packet of ‘Heroin’_** **_fell out of_** **_the key pouch holder_**_”._[^101] The two reproduced fragments of the second Long Statement would have suggested that the accused had not yet formulated his position at trial, which was of Officer Chong having slipped the sachet against the pouch and introducing them together on the car boot. This is despite this statement being given on 24 October 2018, about a week after his arrest, where he would have had ample time to accurately reconstruct the sequence of event and reflect on the account which he wished to render to Officer Adly at this second recording.

109    The first inking of Mr Yasin’s position that the sachet might not have been inside the pouch could be discerned in the Case for the Defence filed by learned defence counsel on 2 October 2019, where he stated that an officer who was Chinese in appearance “_took the key pouch from on top of the car bonnet using his left hand, presumably to check it. After that_ (Mr)_Yasin saw_ (the officer) _place both hands on the bonnet, leaving the pouch on the car boot with his left hand and a small packet on his right hand_” [^102] Hence the earliest, albeit obliquely stated, indication of Mr Yasin’s eventual line of defence came only after almost a year from his date of arrest. In my view this gross dys-synchronicity in time showed Mr Yasin’s final position in relation to the planting of the sachet to be the artifice of an afterthought.

### The evidence of possession would trigger the presumption under section 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act

110    The foregoing would show the deficit in the prosecution’s case of the investigators not checking for the accused’s fingerprints on the sachet was but a small chink in the massive agglomeration of evidence against the accused, including his previous admission that the sachet could have come from a friend. This was set against just Mr Yasin’s assertion of a rogue officer planting the drugs in an implausible scenario of this occurring while he was being searched, and where from both prosecution and defence cases, **_at least_** one other police officer (Officer Razali) had been present with his eyes on both the accused and Officer Chong. also implausible is the notion that Officer Chong, an officer of the police force, would have, in hand, a bag of narcotic substances of the correct dimensions that would fit into Mr Yasin’s key pouch, and that he had the requisite combination of audacity, wherewithal, and desire to frame a person he had never met **_and_** never turn in for analysis a set of suspicious tablets that the same person **_actually_** possessed.

111    Mr Yasin’s defence case would stand or fall with his **_singular_** contention that the sachet had been planted. It was hence suspicious that this was not raised at the time of Mr Yasin’s arrest on 17 October 2018, in his statement recorded **_after_** he had been in custody for some 12 hours, with the first oblique reference coming only a week later. The accused never challenged the voluntariness of any of his Long Statements, and only alluded to his limited comprehension on account of his low education level[^103] at trial, notwithstanding that he was a gainfully employed middle-aged Singaporean at the time of his arrest. The accused has also alluded to his being inattentive when he had signed the first Long Statement allegedly without reviewing the contents as a result of fatigue. It should be clear however that the accused never asserted that he was deprived of sleep at the police lock-up and had indeed “_just woken up from sleep_” when he was called to attend the statement recording “_in the afternoon_”[^104] of the day he had been arrested. Indeed, Mr Yasin agreed with the learned DPP’s contention that before Officer Badawi recorded this statement, he had taken care to ask the accused whether the latter was fit and comfortable to give a statement and that Mr Yasin had responded in the affirmative. Mr Yasin also agreed that it was only upon the premise that Officer Badawi had carried on with the recording of the Long Statement[^105].

112    The fact that Mr Yasin had **_only_** found fault with Officer Badawi’s recording of his admission to taking _diamorphine_ but not in relation to his consumption of _methamphetamine_ and “_Epam”_ tablets after he “_was told that_ (his) _urine sample tested positive_ (by the IUT) _for Amphetamine, Opiate and Benzodiazepines_”[^106] added to the implausibility of Mr Yasin’s defence. It could not be that Officer Badawi had somehow been selectively inaccurate in recording the accused’s consumption of _diamorphine_. That statement had Mr Yasin taking all three types of drugs on the **_same day_**, which was 16 October 2018, starting with “_Panas_” or _diamorphine_ at 5.00 pm[^107], then methamphetamine or ‘Ice” at 8.00pm, and finally taking “_Epam_” tablets at 9.00pm. It was thus suspicious that Mr Yasin had only sought to impose a distance from the recency of his consumption of _diamorphine_ where he faced a trial for possession of the same narcotic substance. The statement also went on to explain his relapse a month from the date of his last consumption of the drug. Ultimately, it mattered most that Mr Yasin could not give any real answer to the highly incriminating part of the Long Statement that “_I told the officer that_ (the sachet) _might have been given to me by my friend but I cannot remember_”[^108], which did cohere with Officer Chong’s evidence of what the accused had told him about the provenance of the packet.

113    It was thus the case that Mr Yasin’s vague and dubious contentions faced an insuperable tide of evidence that showed that he had been in possession of the sachet, as the sachet had been within the pouch seized at the scene, which was, in-turn, on Mr Yasin’s person. As indicated above, Ms Mutiara was not present at the search, and thus could not add much to the defence case on that aspect. While she averred to there being more than two police officers being present, the vagueness of her recall (such as being unable to recall if three or four officers had confronted the party) meant that her testimony was suspect. On the case presented by the prosecution, I am satisfied that **_factual_** possession is established at a standard that went beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the presumptions set out in section 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, would apply, to also presume that Mr Yasin had “_known the nature of that drug_”

## CONVICTION

114    Given the above, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted Mr Yasin in respect of the proceeded charge for the possession of _diamorphine_ in the stated quantity, when he was searched by police on 17 October 2018.

## SENTENCE

### Plea of guilt for methamphetamine consumption

115    Mr Yasin has not appealed against the sentences imposed in either charge. I will therefore, for the sake of completeness, merely give a very brief overview on his sentencing for both charges to set out the post-conviction _sequalae_ for the _diamorphine_ possession charge, principally to explain why he received a concurrent rather than consecutive sentence.

116    Mr Yasin pleaded guilty to a stood-down charge for the consumption of methamphetamine, which was predicated on the following admitted facts[^109]:

> The accused person is Mohamed Yasin Bin Sutoh, a male 63-year-old Singaporean Date of Birth: 18/04/1957.

> 2.    On 17/10/2018 at about 04:50am, the accused person was arrested at 268 Geylang Road for drug related offences. The accused person was then brought back to Bedok Police Division HQ for investigation.

> FACTS RELATING TO 1st CHARGE (DAC/935186/2018) - CONSUMPTION OF METHAMPHETAMINE

> 3.    (_Facts concerning the collection of the urine sample which was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) on 18 October 2018 for analysis_.)

> 4.    (_Facts concerning the findings by two analyses from the Health Sciences Authority’s Analytical Toxicology Laboratory confirming that the accused person’s urine sample had been found to contain methamphetamine_.)

> 7.    Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to The Misuse of Drugs Act (CAP.185).

> 8\. The accused person admitted to smoking ‘Ice’ which is the street name for Crystallized Methamphetamine on 16/10/2018 at a staircase landing of an HDB block close to Geylang Serai Market. He placed the ‘Ice’ onto an aluminium foil and heated the base of it. He then inhaled the fumes using a rolled-up paper. The accused relapsed back to ‘Ice’ for sexual activities.

> 9.    The accused is not authorized to consume Methamphetamine, a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act Cap 185 under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder.

> 10.    (_Facts stipulating the accused person’s eligibility for LT-1 punishment, premised on his prior offending concerning methamphetamine and buprenorphine_)

### Mitigation plea

117    Counsel noted that the charges involved acts which had occurred within a short span of the period on-or-just-before 17 October 2018. The main body of the Mitigation Plea[^110] dealt with Mr Yasin’s background, which was set out in considerable detail. Counsel indicated that Mr Yasin’s drug abuse history had begun in 1974, and he had (inclusive of the present conviction) logged four criminal prosecutions and seven DRC attendances over a 44-year span of his lifetime. For the drug consumption charge, he urged that Mr Yasin receive a sentence of five years and three months’ imprisonment where the mandatory minimum for LT-1 would be five years imprisonment (Mr Yasin would not be subject to caning as he was well past 50 years of age), and also advocated that the court to give a moderate uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence of two-years’ imprisonment for the _diamorphine_ possession charge.

118    The learned DPP had asked for a sentence of two years’ and four months’ imprisonment for the _diamorphine_ possession charge. I did not find this unfair given the fact that the mandatory minimum sentence which applied here was already two years’ imprisonment, and Mr Yasin would not have been entitled to receive any sentencing discounts, which were appurtenant to situations involving individuals who had pleaded guilty. While Mr Yasin had a right of trial, he had utilised this to cast grave aspersions against a police officer upon allegations of Officer Chong having perverted the course of justice in planting the sachet containing diamorphine in his pouch, as well as his peremptory disposal of the accused’s “_Epam_” pills at the scene, both instances being found on close analysis to be completely spurious and without basis.

119    While of lower magnitude in gravity, Mr Yasin also made serious accusations against the recording officers; Officers Badawi and Adly of unprofessional conduct in failing to faithfully record, and comprehensibly recount to him, the statements taken from him during the recording of the Long Statements in October 2018. Similarly, he had accused Officer Razali of breaching protocol in respect of the division of responsibility among officers undertaking a frisk search of a person of interest, by also directly searching him while the former’s proper role was to observe him while the other officer; Officer Chong, conducted the frisk search. An uplift of the four months recommended would be eminently just and fair in the circumstances.

### Sentences imposed

120    After hearing both the prosecution and defence in respect of their sentencing submissions, I imposed the following sentences.

> (a)     DAC-910243-2019Section 8(a) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) p/u Section 33(1) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008)

>> **_Two (2) years' and four (4) months' imprisonment._**

> (b)     DAC-935186-2018Section 8(b)(ii) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008) p/u Section 33A(1) Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, Rev Ed 2008)

>> **_Five (5) years' imprisonment_**

121    I ordered the terms to run concurrently, with the sentence backdated to 25 October 2018 on the global term of five years’ imprisonment.

### Basis for concurrent sentences

122    While possession and consumption of two different drugs (_diamorphine_ and _methamphetamin_e here), might well mean that different legally protected interests were engaged, imposing consecutive sentences would have resulted in a global sentence of seven years and four months’ imprisonment. Even if the four-month uplift for the _diamorphine_ possession offence were to be reconsidered in the interest of proportionality, a global sentence running the sentences end-to-end featuring just the two mandatory minimum terms would still yield a sentence of seven years’ imprisonment. For the possession charge, I noted the weight of the granular/powdery substance in the sachet to weigh just 1.94 grams, and which upon analysis, yielded some 0.02 gram of diamorphine, which was a fairly small quantity. It would, om my view be disproportionate to impose consecutive sentences in such a situation.

### Present status of accused person

123    Mr Yasin is presently serving the global sentence of five years’ imprisonment. As indicated in the beginning of these grounds, Mr Yasin’s appeal is **_only_** in respect of conviction for the _diamorphine_ possession charge. As Mr Yasin had received a **_concurrent_** sentence, and the sentence for the LT1 charge[^111] for _methamphetamine_ consumption of five years’ imprisonment considerably outspans the pronounced sentence of two years and four months’ imprisonment for the _diamorphine_ possession charge, the outcome of this appeal **_will not_** affect the sentence Mr Yasin is required to serve at all. Mr Yasin had pleaded guilty to the former charge, and had neither appealed nor sought any review against the sentence he received, which was, as the mandatory minimum term, the lowest the court could impose.
