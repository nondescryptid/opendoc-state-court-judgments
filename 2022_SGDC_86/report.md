Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Additional imprisonment term imposed in lieu of caning

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9068/2022/01.\]

26 April 2022

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal filed by the accused, Ng Wei Wen Allan (“the accused”), who was dissatisfied with my decision to impose an additional sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each of the six strokes of the cane that he had been exempted from, and that the additional term of imprisonment, totalling 12 weeks was to commence after the expiry of his present sentence.

## Background

### The charges

2       On 20 August 2020, the accused pleaded guilty a total of five charges. These included one charge for rioting under s 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (“PC”), one charge for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon under s 326 of the PC and one charge each under s 9(1)(a), s 9(1)(c) and s 8(1) of the Remote Gambling Act 2014 (No. 34 of 2014) (“RGA”).

3       Two more charges under s 8(1) of the RGA were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC”).

### Summary of the facts (DAC-912797-2017 and DAC-913446-2018)

4       As the accused is only appealing against the additional term of twelve imprisonment imposed _in lieu_ of caning and that the sentence of caning had been imposed for the two PC offences, the brief summary of facts set out below will only relate to these two charges, namely DAC-912797-2017 and DAC-913446-2018.

5       On the morning of 16 April 2017, at about 0410 hours, the accused, with several other persons, were driving in the Clarke Quay multi-storey carpark in a convoy of three cars. When they were at level 2A of the carpark, a person (“the deceased”) kicked out at one of the cars as it drove by. This caused one of the co-accused persons to come out of his car to deliver a punch at the deceased. The deceased fell down, hitting his head on the ground. He subsequently passed away due to the head injury.

6       Two of the deceased’s friends who were walking ahead, then walked towards him. As they did so, the accused came out of his car with a metal bar and used it to strike the first victim, causing him grievous hurt.

7       As the second victim tried to intervene, he was also hit by the metal bar welded by the accused. Thereafter, the second victim was set upon by the accused and six other co-accused persons. The accused and the co-accused persons then left the scene before the arrival of the police.

### The sentences imposed

8       On 16 November 2020, the following sentences were imposed :

### The accused is found medically unfit to be caned

9       The Court was informed _vide_ a medical memorandum dated 16 March 2022 that the accused had been certified unfit to be caned by the medical officer due to a back problem. Court was also informed that the accused earliest date of release was 20 August 2022. The matter was fixed for hearing on 30 March 2022.

10     At the hearing on 30 March 2022, the Prosecution submitted that, following the decision of the High Court in _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ \[2017\] SGHC 904 (“_Amin_”), an additional term of imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning was warranted in this case and that the appropriate length of the enhancement was three months’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of six strokes of the cane.

11     The accused, who was in person, submitted that there should be no increase in his sentence. He highlighted that he would be released soon. He pleaded for leniency and informed the Court that he would have taken the caning if not for the fact that he was medically unfit to be caned. He had gone for an emergency spinal operation in February 2022.

## Whether the sentence should be enhanced imposed _in lieu_ of caning

### The relevant provision

12     Under s 332 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”), where a sentence of caning, whether in whole or in part, is prevented from being carried out because an offender has been certified by a medical officer as being unfit to be caned, the court that passed the sentence may, under s 332(2):

> _“(a_)     _remit the sentence; or_

> (_b_)     _sentence the offender instead of caning, or instead of as much of the sentence of caning as was not carried out, to imprisonment of not more than 12 months, which may be in addition to any other punishment to which the offender has been sentenced for the offence or offences in respect of which the court has imposed caning (called in this section the relevant offences).”_

### The relevant caselaw

13     In _Amin_, the offender had been sentenced to a total of 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for drug related offences. He was later certified by a medical officer to be permanently unfit for caning. The district judge then enhanced the original sentence by 30 weeks’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of caning. The offender appealed against this enhancement, contending that it was manifestly excessive.

14     In _Amin_, the High Court held at \[53\], that the appropriate starting point is that the offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced, unless there were grounds to justify doing so. At \[59\], the High Court considered the following factors that would warrant an enhancement of the sentence of an exempted offender. These factors are the need to:

> (a)     compensate for the deterrent effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption;

> (b)     compensate for the retributive effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption;

> (c)     maintain parity among the co-offenders.

15     At \[60\], the High Court highlighted that even if the factors, above, are present, the court should consider other factors that could militate against the additional term of imprisonment. A non-exhaustive list of these factors listed included:

> (a)     medical grounds;

> (b)     old age

> (c)     compassionate grounds;

> (d)     the need for proportionality; and

> (e)     parliamentary intention in enacting a sentencing regime for a given offence.

### Factors that may warrant an enhancement of sentence

#### The need to maintain deterrence

16     The accused had been found unfit for caning because he had a back problem. The accused would not have known at the time of the commission of the offences that he would be exempted from caning. In fact, the accused himself seemed prepared to undergo caning. Generally, offenders who was exempted from caning due to medical grounds are less likely to have their sentences enhanced (per _Amin_, at \[67\]).

17     At \[63\] in _Amin_, the High Court highlighted that deterrence is likely to be the dominant sentencing consideration behind the imposition of caning for offences impacting public order and social safety. This is exactly how the accused’s caning offences could be characterized as. The offences were committed in a public place. Even though the incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, there were still many people around. This can be seen from the various video footage available, including those taken by members of the public. The actions of the accused and co-accused persons could have potentially put innocent bystanders in danger. I was therefore of the view that, in the present case, an additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent effect of caning that had been lost even though the exemption of caning was due to medical grounds.

18     Further, any additional sentence imposed _in lieu_ of caning cannot be said to be marginal when considering that the total imprisonment term imposed was 29 months.

#### The need to achieve due retribution

19     The accused was sentenced to caning for two charges involving violence, namely for rioting and for voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon. These offences would generally attract caning. The authors of _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Third Edition)_ have noted (at p 43) that, “_…. the court will normally not impose a sentence of caning, unless violence is used_”, and (at p 284), in particular, for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon, that, “_in the absence of exceptional circumstances, caning would also be appropriate_”.

20     More so, the facts surrounding the two offences were particularly egregious. The accused came out of his car with a metal rod and used it to hit the first victim without any provocation. He, likewise, used the same metal rod to hit the second victim who was attempting to render assistance to the first victim. The acts of the accused involved a high level of violence, committed in a public place. Such offences would definitely cause a great degree of public disquiet. I therefore agree with the Prosecution and am of the view that retribution would be the dominant sentencing objective behind the sentence of caning for offences involving violence. Hence, there was a need to compensate for the loss of the retributive effect that was lost when the accused was exempted from caning.

#### Parity with other co-accused persons

21     There were five other co-accused persons charged with the rioting offence, with the sixth co-accused, being the least culpable, being charged for unlawful assembly. The sentences imposed on them reflected their relative culpability. The two co-accused person’s whose culpability were adjudged to be on the higher end were sentenced, like the accused, 1 to 7 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Three others were sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. I am of the view that to maintain the relative parity with the co-accused persons that were adjudged to be of similar culpability as the accused, there was a need in the present case to enhance the sentence of the accused _in lieu_ of caning.

22     There was no necessity to address the parity issue for the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon as there were no other co-accused persons involved.

### Factors that militate against an enhancement of sentence

23     I was of the view that there were really no factors that would militate against an enhancement of sentence. The fact that the accused was exempted from caning on medical grounds was not in and of itself a factor against the enhancement of his sentence (per _Amin_ at \[78\])

## The length or duration of the enhancement

24     The High Court in _Amin_ was of the view that the extent of such enhancement should have some correlation to the number of strokes of the cane that an offender has been exempted from. At \[90\], the court set out the following indicative guidelines:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="39.9%"><col width="60.1%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Strokes avoided</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Enhancement</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to six strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Up to three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seven to 12 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three to six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 to 18 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">six to nine months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">More than 19 strokes</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Nine to 12 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

25     In calibrating the precise extent of the enhancement, I proceeded to consider the factors that prompted the accused’s sentence being enhanced in the first place and how long the additional imprisonment term should be to address these concerns (per _Amin_, at \[91\]).

26     The sentence of caning was imposed for the offence of rioting and voluntarily causing grievous with a weapon. Both were offences that involved violence. These offences were committed without provocation and in public. In the present case, the accused was exempted from six strokes of the cane. He therefore fell within the first band, namely an enhancement of up to three months’ imprisonment. In my view, the facts of this case warranted an enhancement of a sentence at the upper end of the indicative sentencing range of “up to three months’ imprisonment”. Therefore, the proposed enhancement by the Prosecution of three months’ imprisonment _in lieu_ of the six strokes of the cane imposed was not inappropriate.

27     There were really no factors that would warrant a shorter period of additional imprisonment except for the accused’s medical condition that caused him to be exempted from caning in the first place.

## The additional sentence imposed

28     For the aforesaid reasons, I adjusted the enhanced sentence downwards marginally. I proceeded to impose an additional term of two weeks’ imprisonment for each stroke of the cane that the accused was exempted from, making a total of 12 weeks’ imprisonment. I further ordered that this additional term was to commence upon the expiry of his present term of imprisonment.

29     The accused is dissatisfied with my decision and has appealed against the enhancement of sentence. He is serving sentence.
