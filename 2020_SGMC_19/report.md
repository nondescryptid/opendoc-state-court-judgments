### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## A.   Introduction

1       All foreigners who intend to work in Singapore must have a valid work pass issued by the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) before the commencement of their employment. The Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev. Ed.)(“EFMA”) and its related subsidiary regulation, the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 regulates the employment of foreign manpower in Singapore and prescribes the penalties for infringements of these conditions by employers and foreign domestic workers. Section 22(1)(a) EFMA regulates the contravention of conditions of the work passes or in-principle approvals of such work passes. In respect of foreign domestic workers, Regulation 4(2) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 prescribes the conditions that are to be complied with by the employer of a foreign employee issued with a work permit[^1]. The present case involves the enforcement by the MOM of one of the prescribed conditions as set out in Part I of the Fourth Schedule (Conditions to be Complied with by Employer of Foreign Employee who is Domestic Worker issued with In-Principle Approval For Work Permit) of the said Regulations.

#### The Charge

2       The accused, Mrs Belinda Huber@Belinda Tran, a 37 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident had claimed trial to a charge of being an employer of a foreign domestic employee, one Ms Taculad Rose Mae Mata who breached one of the conditions in the MOM work pass by failing to provide safe working conditions and take such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of the said employee at work under section 22(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Cap 91A, 2009 Rev. Ed.) an offence punishable under section 22(1)(i) of the said Act.

#### Background

3       When the accused was first charged in Court 23 on 17 May 2018, the initial charge against the accused as shown below was that between early June 2017 and 4 July 2017, she had failed to provide safe working conditions for her employee on four different occasion when she _instructed_ her employee to clean the glass ceiling located on the second level of the house, over the porch area.

> _MAC 904378-2018 - Exhibit C1_

> “…that you, sometime between early June 2017 and 04 July 2017 on 4 different occasions, at 22, Goldhill Avenue, Singapore 309050, being an employer to whom a work pass (Work Permit:...) for Taculad Rose Mae Mata (FIN: …) applied, did contravene Condition 2 in Part 1 of the Fourth Schedule of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012; to wit, you failed to provide safe working conditions for Taculad Rose Mae Mata by instructing her to clean the glass ceiling, located on the second level of the house, over the porch area, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1)(a) of the Employment Of Foreign Manpower Act, Chapter 91A and punishable under section 22(1)(i) of the same Act.”

4       At the commencement of the trial on 24 October 2019, the Prosecution amended the charge to one of _allowing_ the said employee to clean the glass awning, located on the second level of the house, over the porch area between early June 2017 and 04 July 2017 instead _instructing her_ to clean the glass ceiling on four different occasions. In addition, it was further specified that the contravention was in respect of the conditions as set out in Part I of the Fourth Schedule (Conditions to be Complied with by Employer of Foreign Employee who is Domestic Worker issued with Work Permit) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 namely:

> _MAC 904378-2018 - Exhibit C1C_

> “…are charged that you, sometime between early June 2017 and 04 July 2017, at 22 Goldhill Avenue, Singapore 309050 (“the house”), being the employer of one foreign domestic employee, Taculad Rose Mae Mata (FIN: …), to whom a work pass applied (Work Permit: …), did contravene Condition 2 of the said work pass, when the said work pass was subject to the conditions set out in Part I of the Fourth Schedule (Conditions to be Complied with by Employer of Foreign Employee who is Domestic Worker issued with Work Permit) by virtue of Regulation 4(2) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012, by failing to provide safe working conditions and take such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of the said employee at work; to wit, you allowed the said employee to clean the glass awning, located on the second level of the house, over the porch area, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1) (a) of the Employment Of Foreign Manpower Act, Chapter 91A and punishable under section 22(1)(i) of the same Act.”

5       At the Close of the Prosecution’s Case, the Prosecution once again applied to have the charge amended in order to provide clarity to the location of the offence. The charge was amended as follows:

> _MAC 904378-2018 – “Exhibit C1D”_

> “…that you, sometime between early June 2017 and 04 July 2017, at 22 Goldhill Avenue, Singapore 309050 (“the house”), being the employer of one foreign domestic employee, Taculad Rose Mae Mata…, to whom a work pass applied (Work Permit…), did contravene Condition 2 of the said work pass, when the said work pass was subject to the conditions set out in Part I of the Fourth Schedule (Conditions to be Complied with by Employer of Foreign Employee who is Domestic Worker issued with Work Permit) by virtue of Regulation 4(2) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012, by failing to provide safe working conditions and take such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of the said employee at work; to wit, you allowed the said employee to clean the glass awning, located above the patio area, by standing directly on the glass awning, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 22(1)(a) of the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Chapter 91A and punishable under section 22(1)(i) of the same Act.”

6       At the conclusion of the trial, after having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I was not satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established all the essential elements of the amended charge (_Exhibit C1D_) in the present case. Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution has failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the amended charge in _MAC-904378-2018_ and ordered a Discharge Amounting to Acquittal on the said charge.

7       Dissatisfied with my decision, the Public Prosecutor has filed a Notice of Appeal against the acquittal on 4 February 2020.

8       I now provide the reasons for my decision.

#### The Trial

9       During the trial, the Prosecution had called six witnesses to the stand to give evidence against the accused. They were:

## B.   Undisputed Facts

11     The undisputed facts in the present case are set out below:

> (a)     The accused, her husband and their three children resided at 22 Goldhill Avenue, Singapore 309050 at the material time. The accused gave birth to her third child on 8 May 2017;

> (b)     PW4, a foreign domestic worker to whom a work pass applied had worked for the accused at 22 Goldhill Avenue from 30 April 2017 until 27 March 2018.

> (c)     The MOM Integrated Work Pass Records (_Exhibit P8_) showed that PW4 held a valid work permit to work for the accused as a domestic worker from 1 May 2017 to 19 April 2019;

> (d)     In the course of their employment with the accused, PW3 and PW4 were only given general instructions as well as a set of the detailed lists of household chores and tasks (_Exhibit D4)_ by the accused;

> (e)     The accused had asked her former foreign domestic worker Dela Cruz Carell Cubero (“Kay”) who worked from September 2016 to 29 May 2017 to teach and guide PW4 on the specifics of the household chores;

> (f)     Sometime in late June 2017 to early July 2017, PW4 was seen by PW2 and PW3 cleaning the glass awning over the glass patio at the rear of the accused’s house at 22 Goldhill Avenue in the rain;

> (g)     PW4 was the person photographed in _Exhibit P13_ cleaning the glass awning over the glass patio at the rear of the accused’s house;

> (h)     The said glass awning above the patio area was located beyond the service yard/laundry area at the rear of the house and there was a door that lead to the service yard as shown in _Exhibit P2_;

> (i)     PW2 was the foreign domestic worker working at the neighbouring house at 20 Goldhill Avenue who had taken the photograph (_Exhibit P13_) using her mobile phone of PW4 standing directly over a glass awning at 22 Goldhill Avenue and cleaning it;

> (j)     The said photograph was posted on Facebook and then removed after it went viral. This prompted investigations by the MOM in July 2017 that lead to the present charge against the accused. PW4 had not made any complaints to the MOM regarding the incident;

> (k)     PW3 was the other foreign domestic worker who also worked for the accused at 22 Goldhill Avenue from 19 June 2017 until May 2018;

> (l)     The accused had asked PW4 to teach and guide PW3 on the specifics of the household chores;

> (m)     The accused had asked PW3 to clean the glass awning over the patio but had not taught the latter how to do it. PW3 was to learn from PW4 but PW3 had not been taught how to do so from the date she started working until the date when _Exhibit P13_ was taken;

> (n)     The first time that PW3 saw PW4 cleaning the glass awning by mopping using detergent was the day _Exhibit P13_ was taken. PW3 had held on PW4’s elbow and told her that it was dangerous;

> (o)     The accused had not taught or instructed PW3 and PW4 to clean the glass awning by standing directly over the glass awning nor was it listed in any of the detailed lists of household chores and tasks at _Exhibit D4_ that was given to PW4;

> (p)     PW4 had not complained to PW6 about having to clean the said glass awning at the rear of the accused’s house by standing directly over it during twice monthly visits to her employment agent;

> (q)     At the material time, PW4 had wanted a transfer of employment to a different employer;

> (r)     The glass awning located at the _front_ of the accused’s house as shown in _Exhibit P16_ was not cleaned by any of the accused’s foreign domestic workers;

> (s)     After the photo-taking incident, PW3 and PW4 would clean the glass awning over the patio at the rear of the house by pouring water over the glass ceiling and using the mop to clean it while standing within the laundry area.

## C.   Issue

12     In the present case, the main issue before me was whether during the period between early June 2017 and 4 July 2017, the accused as the employer of PW4 _had allowed_ PW4, a foreign domestic employee to clean the glass awning awning located above the patio area at the rear of the house at 22 Goldhill Avenue, Singapore 309050 by standing directly on the glass awning on more than one occasion.

13     It was the Prosecution’s case that sometime between early June and 4 July 2017, the accused as the employer of PW4 to whom a work pass applied had contravened Condition 2 of the said work pass prescribed in the Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 as she had failed to provide a safe working condition for PW4 by allowing PW4 to clean the glass awning located above the patio area by standing directly on the glass awning at the accused’s residence at 22 Goldhill Avenue, Singapore 309050. Condition 2 states:

> _“_The employer shall provide safe working conditions and take such measures as are necessary to ensure the safety and health of the foreign employee at work_…”_

14     In contrast, it was the case for the Defence that the accused had not allowed PW4 to clean the glass awning by standing on the glass awning. She had not seen PW4 cleaning in the manner described and was therefore not aware that PW4 cleaned the glass awning in such a manner. It was also the Defence’s case that the Prosecution had relied almost entirely on the uncorroborated evidence of PW4, an unreliable witness whose evidence was inconsistent, extremely economical with the truth and was contradicted by far more reliable witnesses of both the Prosecution and the Defence.

## D.   The Prosecution’s Case

15     It was submitted by the Prosecution that the elements of a charge under section 22(1)(a) of the EFMA are as follows:

> (a)     The accused was bound by the work permit conditions;

> (b)     The work permit condition was contravened and

> (c)     There was subjective intent (guilty knowledge) on the part of the accused that the work permit condition was contravened.

16     It was further submitted that the core issue in this case was an _issue of fact:_

> (i)     Did the accused allow PW4 to clean the glass awning by standing on the glass awning and/or

> (ii)     Did she see PW4 cleaning in the manner described?

17     It was the Prosecution’s case that in her evidence, PW4 had recounted the following sequence of events:

![]([2020] SGMC 0019_Image/[2020] SGMC 0019_image1.png)

18     According to the Prosecution once these core facts was accepted by the Court, the inescapable conclusion _must_ be that the act of allowing PW4 to clean the glass awning in the manner described was a breach of work pass Condition 2, and therefore the Prosecution’s case was proven beyond reasonable doubt.

19     It was submitted that the only direct evidence of the existence and details of _the accused witnessing PW4_ standing on the glass awning and cleaning the glass awning stem from PW4 and the accused. It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4 had fully implicated the accused. The accused had denied ever witnessing PW4 standing on the glass awning. The question to be answered was therefore: Whose version of the facts should the Court believe? In other words, who is the more credible witness?

20     It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4’s version of the facts was to be preferred over the versions put forward by the accused, for the following two reasons:

> a.     PW4 was a witness of truth, whose testimony should be believed and accorded full weight by the Court; and

> b.     the accused was a dishonest witness, whose testimony should be disbelieved and accorded little weight by the Court.

## I.   PW4 had no motive to lie

21     It was submitted that critical to the issue of whether PW4 was a credible and honest witness was the question of whether she had a motive to lie about the material facts. As the High Court noted in _Loo See Mei v PP_ \[2004\] 2 SLR 274, the Prosecution bears the burden of proving that a Prosecution witness had no reason to falsely implicate an accused. It was further submitted that the Prosecution had amply discharged this burden and demonstrated that PW4 was an honest and truthful witness with no reason to fabricate evidence about the accused.

22     It was highlighted that PW4 had testified under examination-in- chief that she has nothing against the accused that she would get her into trouble. PW4 also testified that she did not purposely pose so that a photo could be taken of her cleaning the glass awning. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence had essentially suggested through its cross-examination of PW4 that she intentionally climbed down the glass end onto the glass awning and requested her neighbour’s helper PW2 to take her photograph so that it could be sent to the MOM to facilitate her transfer.

23     It was submitted that this line of reasoning, following from the Defence’s suggestion of some sort of motive on the part of PW4 to falsely implicate the accused was illogical to say the least. It was highlighted in _PP v Muhammad Idris Bin Basiran_ \[2007\] SGDC 1047, the District Court had noted:

> ‘…it is inconceivable that a purportedly determined perjurer would want to take such a circuitous and hazardous route in making a false accusation.’ \[42\]

It was further submitted that this reasoning applies with equal, if not greater force here – the ‘circuitous and hazardous route’ in this case involved in putting her own life at risk.

24     According to the Prosecution, closer scrutiny of the sequence of events revealed it to be even less probable that PW4 falsely implicated the accused as part of an elaborate plan just to facilitate a job transfer. It was submitted that PW4 testified that she was afraid that she might not be able to cope with the increased workload after ‘Kay’ left at the end of May 2017 and had asked the accused for a transfer. The accused had assured her that she would be employing another domestic helper and the chores could be shared. When PW3 joined the household in the middle of June 2017, PW4 decided to stay on with the accused.

25     It was further submitted that PW3 had also testified that PW4 did not engineer the whole incident of standing on the glass awning and trying to pose for a picture. It was highlighted that in addition to PW3, PW2 also testified during cross examination that she did not think it was possible for PW4 to pose for her to take a picture so that she could get a transfer. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was patently ludicrous to argue that PW4 would do something so dangerous to stand and clean the glass awning above the patio on a rainy day just so that her transfer to another employer could be facilitated by the MOM.

26     It was submitted that PW6 had also testified that she met PW4 once in every two weeks at the initial stage and thereafter once a month. She testified that PW4 had no complaints and only recently (after the incident), she indicated she might want to change employer.

27     It was the Prosecution’s case that there was no reason for PW4 to stand directly on the glass awning to clean it if she had not been taught to clean the glass awning in the manner she described. It was submitted that there is no dispute that the house is big and there are two adults and three young children. In fact, the accused had given a list of household and children’s maids chores to the domestic helpers employed by her. According to the Prosecution, the list was endless and many chores listed for each of the domestic worker to do on a daily basis. It was submitted that it would be ridiculous to suggest that PW4 on her volition would have volunteered do more work than required when she complained that there was too much work.

28     It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4 was an honest and credible witness since not only did she _not_ have any motive to lie, she in fact had a significant interest in being as candid and truthful as possible.

## II.   PW4’s testimony bears the ‘ring of truth’

29     It was submitted that when testifying in Court, PW4 was candid and forthright in her account of the cleaning of the glass awning. She was frank about Kay teaching her the method of cleaning. It was the Prosecution’s case that if she had wanted to falsely implicate the accused, she could have said that it was the accused who instructed her to clean the glass awning in the manner described.

30     It was further submitted that PW4 had testified that the accused only told her that the glass awning must be cleaned. The step-by-step instructions were taught by Kay. PW4 said she followed Kay’s guidance on how to clean the glass awning as the accused had told her that she should learn from Kay on the specifics. It was highlighted that the same process applied when PW3 was employed. PW3 said that the accused just went through the general directions and left PW3 to learn the specifics from PW4. The accused also testified that she would ask her experienced helper to guide the new domestic helper.

31     It was submitted that PW4 had testified that even though she thought that the manner in which she was taught to clean was dangerous, she decided to continue cleaning in that manner without complaining as Kay told her to and she was afraid she would lose her job. According to PW4 the instructions to clean the glass awning came from the accused, therefore she complied and continued cleaning the glass awning in the manner in which Kay taught her to do and that was:

> a)     Take water from the toilet;

> b)     Sprinkle detergent powder;

> c)     Take water again from the toilet;

> d)     Climb over to the other side, like how PW4 as seen in _Exhibit P13_;

> e)     Take the mop; and

> f)     Clean as how PW4 was seen cleaning in _Exhibit P13_.

32     It was submitted that PW4 had testified that she cleaned the glass awning on _four occasions_ after she started work with the accused; however, she was not able to give the dates. According to PW4, the first time she cleaned the glass awning was when Kay was around and that was her first lesson from Kay on the manner in which the glass awning had to be cleaned. The second occasion was when the accused saw her clean the glass awning and told her to hold onto the railing while cleaning so that she would not fall. The third occasion was when DW2 saw her clean the glass awning. It was further submitted that in fact, DW2 had helped PW4 by passing her a pail of water. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was on this occasion that DW2 advised PW4 that she could save water by cleaning the glass awning when it was raining. On the fourth occasion, PW4 had decided to clean the glass awning as it was raining and the photograph, _Exhibit P13_ was taken on this occasion.

33     It was submitted that PW3 had also testified that she was asked by the accused to clean the glass awning. PW3 testified that the glass awning should be cleaned on a weekly basis. According to her, it had to be cleaned as there was always squirrel droppings as the area behind the house was quite foresty and it was dusty. PW3 had testified that though there was a glass awning at the front of the house, it was not cleaned as the accused had not requested her foreign domestic helpers to do so and there was no squirrel droppings on the front glass awning.

34     It was also submitted that PW3 had testified that she was in contact with Kay and had asked her, during one of their conversations, if this (the way PW4 cleaned the glass awning) was the way to clean the glass awnings and Kay had answered in the affirmative. In addition, PW2 had also testified that she had seen Kay clean in the same manner in which she saw PW4 clean the glass awning. It was highlighted that PW2 had also said that she asked both Kay and PW4 if the instructions to clean the glass awnings in the said manner was from the accused and both of them replied in the affirmative.

35     It was highlighted by the Prosecution that the Defence had insinuated that it was impossible for PW4 to have cleaned the glass awning on at least the four occasions between early June and 4 July 2017 as for a good part of the material period, PW4 was the only domestic helper with the accused and she would have had so much work to do. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was not incredulous for PW4 to clean the glass awning on the number of occasions as PW3 also testified that she had cleaned the glass awning on a weekly basis. It was submitted that the practice of cleaning the glass awning, though not using the same method, went on even after 4 July 2017 as PW3 had yet to start cleaning the glass awning before the photo-taking incident.

36     It was further highlighted that PW4 also candidly admitted that she made the statement recorded on 19 June 2019. At paragraph 11, the recorder had asked a question:

>   
| 

Q5:

 | 

It is possible that Ma’am have wanted you to clean it in a safe way instead of how you cleaned it since Ma’am have not told you how to clean it?

 |
| 

A5:

 | 

Maybe it is possible. No employer would want their maids to climb out to clean it in such a way.

 |
| 

Q6:

 | 

Is there a possibility that there is a miscommunication between you and your Ma’am in the way that you were supposed to clean the glass ceiling?

 |
| 

A6:

 | 

Yes, There might be since Ma’am have not told me how I was supposed to clean it.

It was submitted that when PW4 was asked to clarify what she meant when she said the above, she candidly testified that she said what she said because she thought that no employers would want to endanger the lives of their domestic helpers but the accused did not clarify with her even when she saw her cleaning standing on the glass awning on two occasions. According to PW 4, the accused should have stopped her and told her that the glass awning should not have been cleaned it the manner she was cleaning. PW4 further testified that the accused and she used to converse but there must have been miscommunication as she did not stop PW4 from cleaning in the dangerous manner she did at least on the occasions the accused saw PW4 clean the glass awning.

37     It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4 did not attempt to embellish her version of the facts. It was submitted that she was not an overly enthusiastic witness eager to divulge facts which clearly implicated the accused. She had spoken with candour, even on matters involving the statements given. She gave evidence in a matter-of-fact manner and did not attempt to colour her testimony with bare assertions or unsubstantiated statements of personal opinion. It was submitted that PW4’s evidence was consistent with PW3’s and PW2’s testimonies and it can only be, if the testimony bears a ring of truth. It was the Prosecution’s case that the consistent tenor of her evidence was a simple, accurate and factual account of the cleaning of the glass awning.

38     It was submitted that the Defence had attempted to cast doubt on PW4’s credibility by adducing evidence of PW4 not getting on well with PW3, about stolen food and she bringing in a stranger to the house. It was the Prosecution’s case that this attempt had not only (a) failed to shake PW4’s credibility, but (b) was also entirely misconceived. According to the Prosecution, PW4 had maintained a consistent and coherent account of the facts even under intense cross-examination by the Defence. She reiterated the key facts concerning the cleaning of the glass awning.

39     It was further submitted that on the issue of PW4 bringing a stranger into the house and breaking the rules set by the accused, these were largely irrelevant to the question of her credibility simply because in the present case, PW4 had given evidence that she was not stopped by the accused when she saw her clean the glass awning in the manner she did if it was not safe but asked her to hold on the hand railing. When cross-examined by the Defence, PW4 had admitted that she brought in a stranger to the house.

40     It was submitted that the Defence had questioned PW4 on her lack of action in complaining to the accused that it would be dangerous to climb over the glass panel partition to clean the glass awning. It was submitted that in PW4’s case, the accused had seen her cleaning the glass awning in the aforementioned manner and further, even warned her to be careful, but had never expressed that that was not the correct manner to clean the glass awning. It was the Prosecution’s case that following from that, it was not surprising that PW4 did not complain to the accused, because her case is that the accused was already aware and did not give any instruction to stop.

## III.   PW4’s account was inherently credible and internally consistent

41     It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4’s evidence on her recount from day one of her employment until the day of the photo taking and meetings with MOM was logical, inherently credible and has a simple flow and sequence which the Prosecution submitted is the hallmark of the truth.

42     It was submitted PW4’s testimony concerning the relevant sequence of events flows logically from one event to another and that her evidence was also corroborated in its material aspects and other witnesses.

## IV.   The accused was a dishonest witness, whose testimony should be disbelieved and accorded little weight by the Court

43     In contrast, it was submitted that the accused had denied committing the offence. She testified that she did not see PW4 stand on and clean the glass awning. If she had seen PW4 cleaning in the manner described, she would have asked PW4 to come down. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused was clearly a dishonest witness who is unworthy of credit for the following reasons:

## (i) The accused’s testimony in Court was inconsistent and internally contradictory

#### The accused is a detailed person

44     It was submitted that the accused testified that she is a “detailed person” and she does not want the domestic workers to just clean and tidy the bedrooms. She continued by saying that it was better to be detailed so that there was no misunderstanding, which was the reason why she included all the chores in _Exhibit D4_.

45     It was further submitted that in the same breath, she had also said that _Exhibit D4_ was not an exhaustive list and that she might give ad hoc instructions to the foreign domestic employees on what to clean and what to do. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was supported by PW3’s testimony that there was a possibility that she would be instructed to do chores that were not listed on _Exhibit D4_.

46     It was highlighted that the list of chores also referred to window cleaning. However, the accused had testified that she would only ask her domestic helpers to clean the inside of the windows of the upper floors and not the exterior. It was submitted that such details were not found in _Exhibit D4_. It was the Prosecution’s case that _Exhibit D4_ was a document to guide the domestic workers on their daily and weekly chores. However, the accused had admitted that she would depart from the list and ask them to do chores that were not listed. It was further submitted that cleaning the awning was probably one such unlisted chore. In fact, both PW3 and PW4 said that it was included (though not written) in the chore specified as part of keeping the laundry area clean.

47     It was the Prosecution’s case that given her level of particularity about details, it is highly unlikely that the accused would not have known and did not care how the glass awning was kept clean. It was highlighted that the accused had testified that she had told her foreign domestic workers that the glass awning had to be cleaned and instructed PW4 to use the extendible wiper to push the squirrel droppings into the middle.

#### The accused as a detailed person vs. careless attitude towards safety of domestic helpers under her employ

48     It was submitted that PW6 testified that her agency has a practice of running through all the safety aspects with both the employer and the domestic helper. The employer will go through the document, understand it and then pen his signature. This was the same process adopted when the accused fetched PW4 from her employment agency, which was not disputed by the accused.

49     It was further submitted that the accused had also acknowledged during her cross-examination that she was very familiar with the duties and responsibilities of an employer when it came to the safety of the domestic helpers working under her. In fact, she even made extensive efforts to ensure that her helpers were not in any danger from having to clean the windows, relieving them of any duties to clean the windows on the upper floors which were also kept locked, instructing them to only clean the interiors of the windows on the lower floors, and even then, to only clean them when standing on the ground.

50     It was the Prosecution’s case that yet, the accused had assumed that PW4 would not climb over the glass panel partition, and she had not communicated any specific instructions to her that she should not do so. It was submitted that in fact, the accused had left the manner of cleaning to the discretion of her domestic helpers even if it would be expected of her to at least mention the importance of cleaning the glass awning without climbing over the glass panel. Instead, the accused believed that it was perfectly acceptable to assume that her domestic workers had the common sense not to climb over the glass panel partition and stand directly on the glass awning.

51     It was further submitted that the accused had agreed with the Prosecution that it was possible for her foreign domestic workers to climb over the glass panel partition and onto the glass awning in the event that she had not communicated her instructions clearly to them. The accused also admitted that such accidents could happen due to the lack of communication. Further, the accused acknowledged that it was her duty to ensure that the personal safety of her foreign domestic employees would not be endangered. Yet, according to the Prosecution the accused did not say anything to stop PW4 from cleaning the glass awning by standing directly on it on at least the two occasions she saw PW4 cleaning.

52     It was the Prosecution’s case that the evidence given by PW3 and PW4 were largely consistent and they established that it would be impossible to clean the entire glass awning by standing from inside the kerb area using the extendable wiper, _Exhibit P15_. It was submitted that PW4 had also testified that it would be difficult to utilise a ladder to clean due to her petite size. PW4 had also testified that it was necessary for her to climb out of the glass panel in order to fully remove the squirrel droppings and clean the glass awning in its entirety.

53     It was further submitted that this was consistent with PW3’s testimony that using a mop without climbing over the glass panel would not be able to clean the full length of the glass awning and that when a mop is being used, it can only reach about half the length of the glass awning. It was the Prosecution’s case that in the absence of any other equipment, the only way to clean the full area of the glass awning was to climb over the glass panel partition and step on the glass awning directly.

54     It was submitted that it was unconvincing that the accused as a responsible employer who had described herself as a ‘detailed person’, had omitted to inform PW4 about the importance of not climbing over the glass panel partition, especially when climbing over the glass panel partition and directly onto the glass awning was one of the convenient methods to clean the glass awning. It was further submitted that the accused had not provided any other reasonable methods for doing so and neither did she stop PW4 from cleaning the glass awning when she saw PW4 stand directly on the glass awning cleaning it. Further, it was the Prosecution’s case that the accused is no stranger to her duties and responsibilities.

#### Particularity about cleanliness vs. laissez-faire attitude about glass awning

55     It was submitted that it was undisputed that the accused is particularly concerned about the cleanliness. This had been established during the course of the trial, and the relevant excerpt to demonstrate this is reproduced below[^2]:

> Q:    And so if you want any portions of the house or everything to be clean, you will definitely explain to the helper as to how to clean it because you wanted it to be clean a certain manner?

> A:    Yes.

56     It was highlighted that the accused also testified that she suffered from allergies and that was why she required the domestic helpers to use a Rainbow vacuum cleaner to pick up dust and mites in addition to the domestic helpers using Dyson vacuum cleaners. It was the Prosecution’s case that from the afore-mentioned example, it could be seen that the accused is particular to the extent of requiring her helpers to use two different types of vacuum cleaners in order to clean her house.

57     It was submitted that however, in the same breath, she had testified that she was not very particular about the cleanliness of the glass awning as her friends would still be able to see the sky. She had also testified that she is not particular about the cleanliness of the house where she or the children would not be able to touch. It was further submitted if indeed the accused was telling the truth, then there was no reason for her domestic helpers to have a daily and monthly routine which involves cleaning to the core on all parts of the house where she or her children will not be able to touch.

58     It was submitted that even where the list of chores was not specific, the accused evidently had very specific instructions for how her domestic helpers were to carry out their chores and also specifically told her new domestic workers to learn how to do everything from their predecessors. This was also testified to by PW3 and PW4, who both testified that the accused did not teach them the specifics and only expected them to learn from their predecessors, and that was how they had been doing all the chores in the house.

59     It was highlighted that while the accused admitted asking the domestic workers to clean the glass awning, she testified that she would ask the domestic helpers to clean the glass awning when they saw squirrel droppings on it and clean by just pushing it to the middle. The accused testified that there was an extendable wiper and the domestic helpers were to push the squirrel droppings to the middle and the rain would wash it away. It was submitted that this appeared to be at odds with her earlier admission that she was very particular about cleanliness.

60     It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused did not provide any evidence on which extendable wiper was to be used to clean the squirrel droppings. It was submitted that both PW4 and PW3 had said that _Exhibit P14_ and _Exhibit P15_ seized by PW1 were bought after the photo taking incident and the white wiper they had in the household then was not suitable and would not extend to clean the squirrel droppings.

61     It was the Prosecution’s case that during the course of the trial, the accused was shown to have had high expectations of the foreign domestic employees who were once under her employ. As exhibited in _Exhibit D4_ given to her foreign domestic employees, they were expected to strictly follow the schedule that she had duly prepared for them. The schedule consists of chores which included the cleaning of mirrors, tables, et cetera, cleaning the mirror in the lounge room every single day. Her foreign domestic employees also had to clean the master bedroom and bathroom every day. In addition, the accused would go through with her foreign domestic employees that they must specifically clean the interiors of the window.

62     It was submitted that based on _Exhibit D4_, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the accused is very particular about cleanliness and she would have wanted the glass awning to be cleaned to perfection and not just by pushing the squirrel droppings to the middle of the awning for it to be cleaned by the rain.

#### Not believable that the accused never saw PW4 cleaning the glass awning

63     It was highlighted that the act of PW4 cleaning the glass awning was seen by PW2 on two separate occasions and PW3 on one occasion. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused lives in the same residence and further, was in the house for much of the time from May to June 2017. It was submitted that it sounds incredulous when accused says that she did not see PW4 clean the glass awning. It was further submitted that the accused was not telling the truth when she denied seeing PW4 cleaning the glass awning.

## V.   DW2 and DW3’s evidence should not be believed as they had every reason to protect the accused

64     It was submitted that DW2, the accused’s mother, was in Singapore sometime from May to June 2017 to look after the accused during the accused’s confinement period. She had testified that from 8 May 2017 to 8 June 2017, the accused, who was then in confinement after giving birth to her third child, had remained in the house’s basement and not gone upstairs to the first floor. However, when questioned by the Prosecution, she changed her testimony and stated that the accused did come up to the living room every time she had to take her meals. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused had come up to the kitchen and dining to have her meals and thus had every opportunity to see PW4 cleaning the glass awning. The accused and DW2 trying to distance the accused from coming to the living and kitchen or dining so to say that it was not possible for the accused to have seen PW4 was just yet another failed attempt.

65     It was further submitted that DW2 had also testified that she had seen the glass awning to be dirty and that ‘the glass was not very clear’. However, she denied that she had seen PW4 cleaning the glass awning or that she had offered to fetch a pail of water to assist PW4 to clean the glass awning. It was the Prosecution’s case that DW2 has every reason and motive to protect her daughter and ensure that she does not get into trouble.

66     It was submitted that DW3 had testified that she had never been instructed by the accused to clean the glass awning but when questioned by the Prosecution about the accused’s character and personality, DW3 initially described the accused as a ‘disciplined’ and ‘humble’ person. It was further submitted that DW3 had testified that she transferred to her current employer as her current employer required her. However, when she was confronted with her statements where she said that the accused was very strict and that is why she wanted to transfer, she agreed with the Prosecution that the contents of the statement were true and that the accused was very strict. It was the Prosecution’s case that though she tried to explain it away, the explanation failed as it was obvious from her testimony that she was trying to protect the accused as the accused is her current employer’s good friend.

## VI.   Evelyn Barit Baculag’s statement was irrelevant and should be accorded minimal weight

67     It was highlighted that the Defence had admitted Evelyn Barit Baculag’s (“Evelyn”) statement. Evelyn was not in Singapore and she could not be called as a witness. In her statement, Evelyn said that she did not climb over and stand on the glass awning to clean the same. It was submitted that as Evelyn was not in Singapore, no clarification could be made from her. It was further submitted that it must be noted that Evelyn or any other domestic helpers mentioned by Evelyn in her statement were employed before Kay was employed as a domestic helper. It was the Prosecution’s case that there was every possibility for the accused to have instructed Kay to clean the glass awning in the manner PW4 was seen cleaning after Evelyn left.

68     It was submitted that just because Evelyn or DW3 did not clean the glass awning in the manner that PW4 had cleaned does not mean that the accused did not instruct Kay to clean in the manner PW4 described. It was also not impossible for Kay to have taught the new method to PW4. The crux of the matter is the accused could have stopped the dangerous act on two occasions and she failed to do so.

## VII.   No adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for failing to call the domestic workers who were once employed by the accused but no longer in Singapore

69     It was submitted that it is established law that adverse inferences may be drawn by the Court against a party for failing to produce evidence. Section 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) (‘the EA’) states that:

> **‘‘**The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.’’

70     Illustration (g) of section 116 of the EA additionally provides that:

> ‘The court may presume –

>> …

>> (g)    that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;

71     It was further submitted that the Prosecution had established during the course of trial that all reasonable steps have been taken in order to contact the accused’s former domestic employees, particularly Kay, to assist in investigations and give testimony in court. When investigations first commenced, PW1 had attempted to contact Kay by retrieving her overseas contact details from the employment agency responsible for emplacing Kay with the accused. After receiving the said information, PW1 was initially successful in her attempt to contact Kay, but was unable to remain in contact with her thereafter.

72     It was highlighted that PW5 was the Investigating Officer from the Foreign Manpower Management Division of the MOM who took over the case in May 2019 after PW1 left employment with the MOM. It was submitted that she had testified that she had attempted to speak to Kay on the phone on two occasions. Based on _Exhibit P18_, Kay initially had communicated to PW5 that she was willing to return to Singapore to testify in court if her expenses were covered and PW5 informed Kay that she would get back to her on this. However, subsequently, in October 2019, when PW5 tried to contact her again to make the necessary arrangements, she was unsuccessful in all four attempts.

73     In this regard, in the conduct of this case, both during investigations and leading up to the hearing, it was further submitted that the Prosecution had discharged its duty to ensure that all relevant facts and witnesses, as far as possible, are brought before the Court, and no adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for the failure to produce any particular witness.

## CONCLUSION

74     It was submitted that as was stated in _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR 329</span>, the onus was on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and not beyond all doubt. In that case, the Court stated at \[329\]:

> \[T\]he burden on the prosecution is to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. It is not to prove the case beyond all doubts. That standard is impossible to achieve in the vast majority of cases. In almost all cases, there will remain that minutiae of doubt…The question in all cases is whether such doubts are real or reasonable, or whether they are merely fanciful. It is only when the doubts belong to the former category that the prosecution had not discharged its burden, and the accused is entitled to an acquittal.

75     It was the Prosecution’s case that it had more than discharged this burden. It was submitted that the Prosecution had adduced clear and unequivocal evidence from the Prosecution’s witnesses and exhibits, to support the charge and establish the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

76     It was further submitted that the Defence had not managed to raise any reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt. The Defence’s arguments were illogical, internally inconsistent, and further contradicted by the clear and consistent evidence of the various Prosecution’s witnesses and the exhibits. The accused herself was contradictory and vacillatory, her version of the facts inherently incredible and disingenuous. It was the Prosecution’s case that the accused’s Defence was clearly an afterthought which, even throughout the course of the trial, continually shifted according to what the accused felt would best served her interests. Accordingly, the Prosecution urged the Court to find the accused guilty and convict her of the charge that she faced.

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

77     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence Counsel indicated that he was not making any submission of no case to answer. As I found that the Prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against the accused in respect of the amended charge in _Exhibit C1D_, I called for the accused to enter her defence on the charge.

78     The accused had elected to give evidence in Court in her Defence.

## E.   The Defence’s Case

### Elements of the charge

79     It was submitted by the Defence that it is trite law that to convict the accused on the amended charge (_Exhibit C1D_), the Prosecution would have to prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

> (a)     first, that between early June 2017 and 4 July 2017, PW4 had climbed onto the glass awning located above the patio area of the house to clean it at least one time; and

> (b)     second, that the accused had allowed PW4 to clean the glass awning in the said manner.

80     Regarding the first element above, it was submitted that it was not in dispute that PW4 had climbed atop the glass awning at least once, and this was the fourth alleged occasion which was captured in the photograph marked _Exhibit P13_ showing PW4 on top of the glass awning.

81     It was the Defence’s case that the first three alleged occasions were not supported by any documentary or photographic evidence. It was submitted that the Prosecution had relied on oral evidence, given mainly by PW4 and also by PW2 (as to one of the three alleged occasions) in support thereof.

82     However, it was further submitted that the fact that PW4 had climbed onto the glass awning does not conclude the Prosecution’s case. After all, PW4 could have climbed onto the glass awning of her own accord.

83     It was submitted that the crux of the Prosecution’s case was really the second element, i.e. whether the accused had _allowed_ PW4 to climb onto the glass awning and clean it, thereby endangering PW4’s safety and breaching the EFMA.

84     It was further submitted that the definition of the term “allowed” is broad. Per the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, to “allow” something can be to “_permit_” or to “_fail to restrain or prevent_” same. The former definition of “allow” (i.e. “_permit_”) connotes the giving of a positive directive. The latter definition of “allow” (i.e. “_fail to restrain or prevent_”) connotes implicit consent through inaction. It must be noted however that one can only be in a position to “_restrain or prevent_” (and, conversely, to allow by failing to restrain or prevent) something that one has knowledge or is aware of. Without knowledge, one cannot “allow”.

85     It was the Defence’s case that at the Close of the Prosecution’s case, it became apparent that the Prosecution’s case could be premised on any of the following scenarios:

> (a)     First, that the accused had directly instructed PW4 to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it, thereby “allowing” the said act (“**Scenario 1**”);

> (b)     Second, that the accused had instructed her previous domestic helpers, particularly one Carrell dela Cruz (“Carrell”), who is also known as “Kaye” or “Kay”, to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it and then instructed PW4 to learn how to clean the glass awning from Carrell, thereby “allowing” PW4 to commit the said act (“**Scenario 2**”);

> (c)     Third, that on one or two of the four alleged occasions, the accused had observed or sighted PW4 standing on top of the glass awning to clean it and failed to tell her to get off the glass awning or to otherwise stop her from continuing, thereby “allowing” PW4 to continue cleaning the glass awning by standing atop it (“**Scenario 3”**).

## I.   Timeline of key events

86     It was the Defence’s position that the dates and times of the alleged occasions were critical to the overall case. As such, the Defence had set out below a timeline of the key events taking place from the time PW4 started working as a domestic helper for the accused to the time of the fourth alleged occasion.

![]([2020] SGMC 0019_Image/[2020] SGMC 0019_image5.png)

## II.   Preliminary point on the date of the first alleged occasion

87     It was submitted that the amended charge (_Exhibit C1D_) referred to incidents allegedly occurring between early June 2017 and 4 July 2017. According to PW4’s own testimony in cross-examination, the first alleged occasion occurred when the accused was pregnant with her third child. According to above timeline, the accused gave birth to her third child on 8 May 2017. This meant that according to PW4 the first alleged occasion occurred before 8 May 2017.

88     It was submitted that this would place the first alleged occasion _outside_ of the time frame specified in the amended charge. Accordingly, it was further submitted that the first alleged occasion should not arise for consideration at all when considering whether the elements of the charge have been made out.

## III.   Scenario 1 was not made out – Accused did not instruct PW4 to climb on top of the glass awning to clean it

89     It was submitted that as the accused never gave PW4 any instruction to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it, Scenario 1 was not made out. It was PW4’s evidence that it was _Carrell_ who had told her that she was to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it. According to PW4, Carrell had given her a step-by-step demonstration of how to clean the glass awning, during which demonstration Carrell explicitly told PW4 that she would have to climb over the glass panel onto the glass awning to clean it with a mop.

90     From the above, it was further submitted that it was clear that if at all any instruction was given to PW4 to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it, it was given by Carrell and not the accused. This was reinforced by PW4’s evidence that the accused had never taught her how to clean the house at all.

91     Further, the Defence had referred to _Exhibit P17_, a statement given by PW4 to the MOM in June 2019. On the second page of the statement, PW4 had stated that:

> _“Ma’am have not told me how I was supposed to clean it \[i.e. the glass awning\]”._

It was submitted that from PW4’s own evidence was that instructions on how to carry out household chores (including the cleaning of the glass awning) were given to her not by the accused, but by Carrell. As such, there could not have been any instruction from the accused to PW4 to climb the glass awning to clean it.

## IV.   Scenario 2 was not made out – the accused did not teach Carell to climb the glass awning and then get PW4 to learn the same from Carell

92     It was submitted to prove Scenario 2, the Prosecution must first of all prove that the accused had in fact instructed her previous helpers, in particular Carrell, to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it.

## A.   The only “evidence” that the accused had taught or instructed Carrell to climb the glass awning was hearsay and therefore inadmissible

93     It was the Defence’s case that the only “evidence” that the accused may have taught Carrell to climb the glass awning came in the form of PW4’s oral testimony on what she had allegedly been told by Carrell. It was submitted that Carrell was not called as a Prosecution witness and gave no evidence in the proceedings.

94     It was further submitted that PW4 had given evidence of an alleged out-of-court statement made by Carrell that the accused had taught her (i.e. Carrell) to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it and the Prosecution was now seeking to use Carrell’s out-of-court statement to prove that the accused had done so. It was the Defence’s case that this constitutes hearsay evidence which is _prima facie_ inadmissible, following the below passage taken from paragraph \[26\] of _Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 430</span>; <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGCA 49</span>:

> “The rule against the admissibility of hearsay evidence is firmly ingrained in our law of evidence and procedure**.** Jeffrey Pinsler, in his book, Evidence, Advocacy and the Litigation Process (Butterworths, 1992), gives a succinct definition of the rule at p 64:

> \[T\]he assertions of persons made out of court whether orally or in documentary form or in the form of conduct tendered to prove the facts which they refer to (ie facts in issue and relevant facts) are inadmissible unless they fall within the scope of the established exceptions.

> Thus, assertions which are made out of court and which are tendered in court as evidence as to the truth of the content therein will be inadmissible as hearsay.”

95     It was submitted that as per paragraph \[2.019\] of _Jeffrey Pinsler SC, Evidence and the Litigation Process (LexisNexis, 4th ed., 2013)_ (“Pinsler”), while the rule against hearsay, being an “_exclusionary_” rule, is not codified in the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997 Rev. Ed. Sing.) (“EA”), it is “_given effect by the specific circumstances in which evidence may come in as exceptions to those rules_.”

96     It was further submitted that in the case of hearsay evidence, the “_specific circumstances_” are found in section 32 of the EA. The following observation at paragraph \[2.021\] of Pinsler is pertinent:

> “… Section 32 is a broad provision which admits out-of-court statements in a variety of situations.”

97     It was the Defence’s case that essentially, a statement determined to be hearsay may not be admitted unless any of the specific circumstances set out in section 32 of the EA applies. It was submitted that as none of the circumstances in section 32 of the EA were applicable, the out-of-court statement made by Carrell (who was not even called as a witness) and sought to be admitted through PW4 was inadmissible hearsay evidence.

98     The Defence had also referred to section 62(1) of the EA, which provides as follows:

> “Oral evidence must in all cases whatever be direct —

>> (a)    if it refers to a fact which could be seen, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he saw that fact;

>> (b)    if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he heard that fact;

>> (c)    if it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other sense or in any other manner, it must be the evidence of a witness who says he perceived that fact by that sense or in that manner;

>> d)    if it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds that opinion on those grounds.”

99     It was submitted that PW4’s testimony that Carrell had informed her that it was the accused who instructed Carrell to climb on the glass awning was not direct evidence of the fact that the accused allegedly gave such instructions. It was further submitted that PW4’s testimony fell foul of section 62(1) of the EA. It was the Defence’s case that given that it was Carrell who had allegedly seen, heard or otherwise perceived the accused making statements or giving instructions on how to clean the glass awning, it was only Carrell who could give direct oral evidence on this. As it is, Carrell was not called as a witness and there was no admissible evidence on this point. It was submitted that as there was no evidence whatsoever that the accused had taught Carrell to climb the glass awning to clean it, the Prosecution’s case in respect of Scenario 2 must fail.

## B.   An adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution in view of its failure to call Carrell as a witness

100    It was submitted that even if the Court was not with the Defence on its position above regarding PW4’s hearsay evidence, the Court should draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for failing to call Carrell as a witness and find that had Carrell testified, she would have given evidence that the accused had never taught her to clean the glass awning by climbing on top of it.

101    Two Prosecution witnesses, PW1 and PW5 had given evidence as to the steps the Prosecution allegedly took to secure the attendance of Carrell (who would have been best positioned to testify on whether the accused had indeed taught her to clean the glass awning in the manner aforesaid) as a witness. According to her evidence-in-chief, PW1 had commenced investigations into the case sometime in July 2017 and left her post at the MOM sometime in April 2019. It was submitted that it would appear that in the one year and 9 months that she spent investigating the present case, PW1 had obtained the contact details of Carrell, got in contact with her once, purportedly made an unspecified number of further attempts to contact her and decided for herself that Carrell was uncontactable.

102    It was highlighted that following the departure of PW1 from MOM, PW5 took over as the investigating officer in charge of the case. In cross-examination, PW5 had admitted that in her first three months on the case, she made no attempt to contact Carrell whatsoever. PW5 had testified further that she eventually managed to speak to Carrell on the phone twice, recording the same in her investigation notes marked _Exhibit P18_. In PW5’s first conversation with Carrell on or around 27 August 2019, Carrell expressed willingness to travel to Singapore to testify as a witness so long as her airfare was paid for. In PW5’s second conversation with Carrell on or around 16 September 2019, Carrell reiterated her position and added that she would “_need to seek permission_” to travel to Singapore. PW5 informed Carrell that she would “_get back to her on this_”. However, it was only around three weeks prior to the trial of this matter that PW5 made further unsuccessful attempts to contact Carrell.

103    It was submitted that from the above, it can be seen that the Prosecution could and did in fact get in contact with Carrell. Indeed, Carrell had indicated willingness to travel to Singapore, albeit subject to conditions which were in any event made clear to the Prosecution. In light thereof, the Defence submits that had the Prosecution exercised greater effort, Carrell’s attendance as a witness would in all certainty have been secured. Hence, the Defence submits that the Prosecution cannot avail itself of s 32(1)(j)(iii) of the EA, namely:

> “Subject to subsections (2) and (3), statements of relevant facts made by a person (whether orally, in a document or otherwise), are themselves relevant facts in the following cases:

>> (j)    when the statement is made by a person in respect of whom it is shown —

>> (iii)   that he is outside Singapore and it is not practicable to secure his attendance;”

104    It was further submitted that section 116, Illustration (g) of the EA provides as follows:

> “The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.

> Illustrations

> The court may presume —

>> (g)    that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it”.

105    It was the case for the Defence that as the oral evidence of Carrell could have been produced but for the failure of the Prosecution to exercise greater efforts in securing her attendance, Illustration (g) to section 116 of the EA applied and the Court should therefore draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution and find that had Carrell appeared in Court, she would have testified that the accused never taught her to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it.

## C.   The accused never taught or instructed any of her other helpers to climb the glass awning to clean it

106    It was submitted that the evidence overwhelmingly indicated that the accused had neither taught nor told any of her other domestic helpers to climb the glass awning to clean it.

#### i.   The accused’s other domestic helpers have given evidence that they were not taught or instructed to climb the glass awning by her

107    It was the case for the Defence that three of the accused’s previous domestic helpers had given evidence that they were not taught by the accused to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it.

108    The Defence had highlighted the following excerpt from _Exhibit D11_, a statement given by Evelyn Barit Bacuyag (“Evelyn”) (who worked as a domestic helper for the accused from January to August 2016) to the MOM on 13 July 2017 that was admitted into evidence by consent:

> “    Question 5: Have you ever seen the other maid, be it Racquel, Rose and Mery Jane, clean the glass ceiling like the lady in the photograph?

> Answer 5: I have never seen Racquel clean the glass ceiling and I do not know if she cleaned the glass ceiling before I came to work for Ma’am.

> For Rose, she never clean the glass ceiling and her role was mainly doing general cleaning in the house and also cooking while I look after the children. I remembered that when Rose came, there was no cleaning of glass ceiling because it was always raining, therefore the glass ceiling was never dirty.

> For Mery Gane, I never saw her cleaning the glass ceiling and I do not know if she cleaned the glass ceiling after I left Singapore.”

It was further highlighted that the ‘Rose’ referred to in the above excerpt does not refer to PW4 but instead refers to DW3 who had worked for the accused from February 2016 to June 2016.

109    It was submitted that DW3 had remained steadfast and consistent in testifying that the accused had never ever instructed her to clean the glass awning[^3]:

> “Q    Now, you gave evidence in your Examination-in-Chief that you did not clean the glass awning that was seen in P1, correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    And you said because you were not instructed to do so?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Were there any instructions to clean this glass or no

> instructions at all?

> A    Never at all.

> Q    Was there any instructions saying that you know if it is dirty or if there is a squirrel droppings using something like a---extendable wiper like this to push the squirrel droppings or clean the squirrel---clean the dirt?

> A    Never.

> Q    So, no instructions at all?

> A    Yes.”

110    It was highlighted that for the entire time that DW3 had worked for the accused, so did Evelyn. It was the Defence’s case that if the accused had wanted the glass awning cleaned during this time, she would have made sure that either of them learnt the method of doing so. It was further submitted that as it is, the evidence of Evelyn and DW3 was to the effect that no instructions were given for the cleaning of the glass awning, and that for DW3’s four-month tenure under the accused, the glass awning was not cleaned at all.

111    In respect of DW3 specifically, it was noted that she testified in cross-examination that she had requested to transfer out of the accused’s employment partly because she felt that the accused was “_strict_”. It was submitted that clearly DW3 was not biased in favour of the accused and had no reason or motive to give favourable testimony on the accused’s behalf. It was further submitted that DW3’s evidence was credible and reliable and should be accorded due weight by the Court.

112    It was highlighted that PW3 had testified that she was not given any instructions on the method to be used to clean the glass awning[^4]:

> “Q    Now, did you have any instructions on how to clean this glass awning?

> A    No.”

It was the case for the Defence that given the evidence of the other domestic helpers employed by the accused that no instructions were given to them to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it (or, in the case of Evelyn and DW3 to clean the glass awning at all) it was entirely inconceivable that the accused would have singled out Carrell to be the only helper to have been taught to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it.

#### ii.   The accused told her domestic helpers that they were to clean the glass awning only if they saw animal droppings on it and only using an extendable wiper

113    It was submitted that on the contrary, it was the accused’s evidence that she told her domestic helpers to clean the glass awning only if they saw animal droppings on it and only using an extendable wiper. It was the case for the Defence that the accused is not fussy about having the glass awning cleaned unless there are animal droppings on it as she had testified in Court. As to why she does not place much importance on having the glass awning cleaned in general, the accused had explained that this was because she and her children do not touch it.

114    It was further submitted that this explanation made sense and should be believed by the Court. As a mother, the accused would certainly want to ensure a hygienic environment for her young children, and would surely prioritise the cleaning of surfaces and items that her children came into contact with. As the accused had testified, the expectation on her domestic helpers regarding the cleaning of the glass awning was simply that if they saw animal droppings on the glass awning, they were to use an extendable wiper to push same to the middle of the awning where it would be washed away by the rain.

115    It was the Defence’s case that this account was eminently believable and made reference to the pictures in _Exhibit D1_ to _Exhibit D3_. The pictures showed that as long as rain pours onto the glass awning, the portion of the glass awning further away from the laundry area at the rear of the house is effectively cleaned. It was submitted that given that the glass awning both subjectively and objectively did not require frequent cleaning at all, and given that the little required cleaning could be carried out using an extendable wiper, the accused’s evidence was credible and should be believed.

## V.   Scenario 3 was not made out – the accused never noticed or sighted PW4 atop the glass awning

116    It was submitted that Scenario 3 was not made out. In support of its case as concerns Scenario 3, it was highlighted that the Prosecution relied chiefly on the oral evidence of PW4 (who claimed that the accused saw her on top of the glass awning on two occasions), which evidence was wholly unreliable and unbelievable. Accordingly, the Defence invited the Court to find that the accused never saw PW4 atop the glass awning.

117    It was pointed out that according to PW4’s evidence, the accused had witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning on two alleged occasions (i.e. the second and third alleged occasions). It was submitted that it was not PW4’s evidence that the accused had seen her atop the glass awning on the first and fourth alleged occasions. As such, it was further submitted that the Prosecution’s case in respect of Scenario 3 must be limited to the second and third alleged occasions.

118    It was highlighted that the only witness who testified that the accused had seen PW4 atop the glass awning on two occasions was PW4 herself. The accused had testified that she never saw PW4 atop the glass awning. DW2 whom PW4 had alleged was also present with the accused on the third alleged occasion, had also testified that she never saw PW4 or indeed any other domestic helper, atop the glass awning. As such, it was important for the Defence to submit on PW4’s lack of credibility and reliability, including in respect of her accounts of other alleged occasions besides the second and third alleged occasions.

## A.   PW4 was not a credible witness and her evidence should be disbelieved

119    It was submitted that PW4 was not a credible witness and her evidence should be disbelieved. PW4’s recollection of key details of the four alleged occasions was patchy, her oral testimony contains several internal and external inconsistencies and her narrative did not cohere with the broader factual picture. It was the Defence’s case that all of this pointed to PW4 being economical with the truth or, at the very least, having extremely poor memory of the material facts and circumstances. The Defence invited the Court to treat PW4’s evidence with much circumspection.

#### i.   PW4’s evidence on key details of the four alleged occasions was patchy and internally inconsistent

120    It was submitted that PW4 was mostly unable to provide clear and consistent evidence as to key details of the four alleged occasions such as the dates thereof and the eyewitnesses thereto over the trial of the present matter. It was further submitted that where PW4 gave evidence the evidence was inconsistent, vague and/or incredible. First, PW4 was unable to recall the dates of the four alleged occasions, as evidenced by her admissions to this effect and/or her inconsistent evidence thereon.

#### First occasion

121    It was the case for the Defence that on the first alleged occasion, PW4 had testified positively in examination-in-chief that this happened _one day after_ Carrell had given her the alleged demonstration on how to clean the glass awning[^5]:

> “Q    Now, so that was---was that the first time when ‘Kaye’ taught you how to clean? Did you clean on that day when ‘Kaye’ taught you how to clean?

> A    No, the next day.”

It was submitted that immediately after, PW4 purported to correct herself and change her position on when the first alleged occasion happened[^6]:

>   
| 

“Q

 | 

So, you said that you cleaned the glass awning the next day after ‘Kaye’ taught you how to clean it, right?

 |
| 

Interpreter:

 | 

So, she said, ‘I would like to correct. It’s not the following day, it’s a few days later after she taught me.”

 |

  
  

It was further submitted that in cross-examination, however, PW4 confessed that she was completely unable to remember when the first alleged occasion happened[^7]:

> “Q    So, when was the first time you cleaned the awning?

> A    I can’t recall the exact date but I did clean that day

Further on in cross-examination, it was highlighted that PW4 was somehow able to place the first alleged occasion before the birth of the accused’s third child on 8 May 2017[^8]:

> “Q    Alright. So, what you’re saying is, the first time you cleaned the awning, Ma’am Belinda was pregnant and there were 2 children. Is that correct?

> A    Yes.”

122    It was the Defence’s case that it was PW4’s evidence that she knew that the birth date of the accused’s third child was 8 May 2017 shortly after PW4 had started working for the accused. It was submitted that as such PW4 must have been well aware that, according to her own narrative, the first alleged occasion would have occurred in early May 2017, certainly before 8 May 2017. Yet, when given an opportunity to clarify the approximate time-frame for the first alleged occasion, PW4 had failed to do so. It was further submitted that aside from revealing PW4’s weak memory of the material events, the above shows PW4’s evasiveness as a witness. It was the Defence’s case that her unwillingness or inability to state that the first alleged occasion would have occurred in early May 2017 despite all her evidence pointing to this conclusion was particularly telling.

#### Second occasion

123    It was highlighted that PW4 was unable to recall the exact day, month or exact date of the alleged second occasion but maintained that the accused had seen her cleaning on that day. PW4 could not even remember whether the second alleged occasion occurred while Carrell was still working for the accused. Yet, when asked again about the second alleged occasion, PW4 was somehow able to place it around the date of birth of the accused’s third child. It was submitted that again, PW4 was inconsistent in her evidence and/or exhibiting selective memory when it suits her.

#### Third occasion

124    It was similarly highlighted that PW4 was unable to recall the exact day or the exact month of the third occasion when DW2 saw her cleaning the glass awning. It was submitted that on top of being unable to provide the date or month of the third alleged occasion, PW4 was also unable to recall whether it had occurred before or after the birth of the accused’s third child. It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s answers on when the second and third alleged occasions occurred again point to her being evasive and an unreliable witness.

125    It was submitted that in light of her evidence that the accused was in the hospital giving birth to her third child at the time of the second alleged occasion, it would only have been logical for PW4 to state that the third alleged occasion had occurred after the accused had given birth. Yet, she was unable to do so.

126    It was further submitted that for PW4 to be uncertain as to whether the third alleged occasion had occurred before or after the birth of the accused’s third child on 8 May 2017 meant that PW4 thought it possible that she had cleaned the glass awning three times before 8 May 2017 (the ninth day in the accused’s employment). It was the Defence’s case that this would be an absurd and extremely far-fetched scenario, and the fact that PW4 did not dismiss this outright suggests extremely poor recollection or, more likely, evasiveness on her part.

127    It was the case for the Defence that despite her inability to recall the details of the three occasions, PW4 was able to state with certainty that they had occurred before PW3 started working for the accused on 19 June 2017. It was submitted that this again shows up PW4’s selective memory and unreliability as a witness. She was able to recall clearly that the first three alleged occasions occurred before PW3 started work, yet she could not give a definite answer of whether the accused had already given birth on the second and third alleged occasions, choosing instead to remain evasive.

#### Fourth occasion

128    It was highlighted that on the fourth alleged occasion, PW4’s testimony on the first day of trial was that it had happened at the end of June 2017[^9]:

> “ Q    So, how many times did you clean the glass awning? 4 times or 5 times?

> A    4 times.

> Q    4 times. And the last time was at the end of June?

> A    Yes. When the photo was taken.”

129    It was submitted that on the second day of trial, however, PW4 stated positively that the date of the fourth alleged occasion was 4 July 2017[^10]:

> “Q    Now, so, the last time you cleaned the ceiling was some time at the end of June 2017?

> A    It took place on July 4.

> Q    July 4th?

> A    The photo taking.

> Q    And how do you know that?

> A    How could I not know, that’s the day when my photo was taken. You see, you cannot say that it took place in June because it took place sometime in July.”

It was further submitted that at this juncture, for PW4 to be able to state with confidence that the fourth alleged occasion occurred on 4 July 2017 and yet was unable to even commit to approximate time frames for the first three alleged occasions was unbelievable and strongly indicated that PW4 was evasive and/or unreliable. This reaffirmed the Defence’s submission that PW4 was not a credible witness at all.

130    It was the case for the Defence that from the above, it is clear that PW4 was unable to recall key dates and details. More importantly, it was also clear that instead of forthrightly admitting to her inability to recall same, PW4 would change her position on the stand throughout the course of trial. It was submitted that her evidence was riddled with inconsistencies and entirely unreliable.

131    It was the case for the Defence that PW4 gave inconsistent evidence as to the persons who had personally witnessed the four alleged occasions. When these inconsistencies were brought to her attention, PW4 would respond with bare denials or excuses.

132    It was submitted that PW4 had agreed on the second day of trial that the _only_ persons who had witnessed the first three alleged occasions were Carrell, the accused and DW2[^11]:

> _“Q_     So, nobody else saw you on the ceiling in the second---first, second and third incidents except ‘Kaye’, Belinda and Belinda’s mother.

> A    Yes, Your Honour**.**”

However, just seconds later, PW4 disclosed that PW2 had _also_ witnessed one of the first three alleged occasions, something that she had completely omitted to mention prior thereto[^12]:

> “ Q    According to Lyn, she saw you once on the ceiling and spoke to you before taking the picture. The incident of taking the picture, is that true?

> A    Yes.”

It was highlighted that when this inconsistency was brought to PW4’s attention, she had made up a feeble excuse that Counsel for the Defence “_didn’t ask me specific question_. _Because you asked me within the premise of the house_”[^13].

133    It was the Defence’s case that nowhere in the record was it disclosed that Counsel for the Defence had confined his questions to persons “_within the premise of the house_” as alleged by PW4. It was submitted further that PW4 had every opportunity in her one-hour-long examination-in-chief to disclose this allegation. It was the case for the Defence that accordingly, the Court should not believe PW4’s explanation for completely omitting to mention PW2’s alleged eyewitness involvement in the first instance. It was submitted that in any event, it is telling that PW4 was unable to identify which of the first three alleged occasions PW2 was purportedly an eyewitness to[^14]:

> “Q    So, did she see you on the first, second, third incident?

> A    I can’t remember but she saw me once before the photo taking.

134    It was further submitted that when PW4 was cross-examined on who had witnessed the fourth alleged occasion (i.e. the incident captured in _Exhibit P13_), she had agreed that three persons – the accused, DW2 and Carrell – were present[^15]:

> “Q    Oh, so, Ma’am---so, what you are saying is Belinda, her mother, and ‘Kaye’ were around when the photo was taken?

> A    Yes.”

However, minutes later, PW4 had attempted to retract this version of events and denied having agreed as above[^16]:

> “ Q    4 times. And the last time was at the end of June?

> A    Yes. When the photo was taken.

> Q    And you just said that when the photo was taken, Belinda, Belinda’s mother and ‘Kaye’ were around.

> A    No.

> Q    You just said that, Witness.

> A    No. I said that---first thing that I said---said the first time I cleaned that, ‘Kaye’ was around.

> Q    No---

> A    Second occasion, Ma’am Belinda was there. Sec---third---third time, the mother was around.

> Q    And fourth time?

> A    Fourth occasion, the photo was taken. So, I didn’t say that on the day that the photo was taken, these people were around.”

It was the case for the Defence that from the above, PW4’s inability to give a consistent account of key details surrounding the four alleged occasions can again be seen.

#### ii.   PW4’s evidence on key details of the four alleged occasions is inconsistent with the evidence of other Prosecution witnesses

135    It was submitted that PW4’s evidence is not only internally inconsistent, it is externally inconsistent as well in that it differs from the evidence of other Prosecution witnesses in several respects. The Prosecution’s three factual witnesses are PW4, PW3 and PW2, the latter two of whom gave evidence particularly on the fourth alleged occasion. PW2 had also gave evidence that prior to the fourth alleged occasion, she had seen PW4 once previously atop the glass awning, although she could not remember the date or month of such incident.

136    It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s evidence was contradicted in several respects by the evidence of PW3 and PW2. _Exhibit P13_, a photo taken by PW2 of PW4 cleaning the glass awning while standing atop it on the fourth alleged occasion had made its way onto an Internet article, which according to PW1 was circulated on social media. It was only because of the circulation of _Exhibit P13_ on social media as aforesaid that the MOM became aware of the incident and commenced investigations into the present matter sometime in July 2017.

137    It was submitted _Exhibit P13_ was of much significance to the present case and thus so are the details of how it came to be taken. Given a chance in re-examination to clarify once and for all the circumstances in which it came to be taken, PW4 had testified that it was PW2 who had first decided that a photograph should be taken of her atop the glass awning. This, however, contradicted the testimony of PW2 that it was PW4 who had requested that her photograph be taken. PW3 who was also present during the incident, likewise testified that it was PW4 who had requested that a photograph be taken. It was the Defence’s case that clearly PW4’s testimony on who had ‘initiated’ the taking of _Exhibit P13_ does not stand up to scrutiny and had directly contradicted the evidence of the other two witnesses.

138    Aside from the fourth alleged occasion and how it came to be taken, it was further submitted that the evidence of PW4 in respect of the conversation that she allegedly had with PW2 on one of the first three alleged occasions (on which PW2 apparently saw PW4 on the glass awning) contradicts PW2’s evidence. PW4 had testified as follows[^17]:

> “ Q    So, did she see you on the first, second, third incident?

> A    I can’t remember but she saw me once before the photo taking.

> Q    And you spoke to her?

> A    Yes. She told me that I was not the only who did that before, there were many others.”

It was highlighted that this description of the conversation does not match PW2’s version, which is as follows[^18]:

> “Q    have you seen Rose cleaned the glass awning before?

> A    Yes.

> Q    How many times?

> A    Once.

> Q    Did you say anything to Rose then?

> A    I just asked her if she---she was really really instructed to clean.

> Q    Were there any other conversations apart from this?

> A    About this?

> Q    Yah, because you said you asked her if she was really instructed to clean. Was there anything else that was conversed apart from that?

> A    No other

It was the Defence’s case that it was highly unlikely that PW2 would have told PW4 that she had seen “_many others_” besides PW4 climb the glass awning, as alleged by PW4.

139    It was highlighted that when this inconsistency was brought to PW4’s attention, she stuck to her story and insisted that PW2 was lying:

> _“ Q_     E---e---you---you say that Lyn told you that she saw many others. Now, Lyn’s evidence is that---her sworn evidence is that there was---she only saw one other incident form the ceiling, one by a person called ‘Carrell’.

> A    No, because she told me many others.

> Q    But that’s her evidence so either you are lying or she is lying.

> A    So, she.

> Q    So, she is lying?

> A    Why would I lie, I’m just telling you the truth.

> Q    Now Witness, you lied to make up your story.

> A    I’m not making up a story.

> Q    Lyn has said that she spoke to you once before she has said that you asked her to take the picture. She has said that she only saw one other person Carrell. Is she lying about all these things?

> A    Yes.”

It was submitted however that the Court should find that if anyone was being economical with the truth, it was PW4 rather than PW2, given PW4’s complete failure to provide a clear and consistent recount of events or to admit to her inability to provide the same due to limited recall.

#### iii.   It was incredible and unbelievable that PW4 would have cleaned the glass awning on three alleged occasions before photograph P13 was taken

140    It was submitted that on top of being riddled with internal and external inconsistencies, PW4’s evidence did not make sense when considered against the broader factual backdrop, particularly as regards the frequency with which she allegedly cleaned the glass awning. It was highlighted that at face value, the Prosecution’s case appeared to be as such:

> (a)     the first alleged occasion took place sometime between around 4 May 2017, being “_a few days_” after Carrell had allegedly cleaned the glass awning for demonstration purposes, which occurred on 1 May 2017 (i.e. “_the next day_” after PW4 started work on 30 April 2017) or 2 May 2017 (i.e. “_the following day_”) and 8 May 2017 (the date of birth of the accused’s third child);

> (b)     the second occasion took place after the first alleged occasion but before 18 June 2017 (the day before PW3’s first day as the accused’s helper on 19 June 2017);

> (c)     the third alleged occasion took place after the first two alleged occasions and in any event sometime between DW2’s arrival in Singapore (which DW2 testified was two days before the birth of the accused’s third child on 8 May 2017) and 18 June 2017 (the day before PW3’s first day as the accused’s helper on 19 June 2017) and

> (d)     the fourth alleged occasion (i.e. the date on which _Exhibit P13_ was taken) occurred in late June or early July 2017.

141    It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s testimony to the effect that, prior to the fourth alleged occasion, the glass awning had been cleaned four times (three times by herself corresponding to the first three alleged occasions and one time by Carrell as a demonstration) in a period of less than 7 weeks (i.e. from around 4 May 2017 to 18 June 2017) was unbelievable and flies in the face of all the evidence showing how infrequently the glass awning was required to be cleaned.

142    It was submitted that it was in any event extremely unlikely that PW4 would have had the time to clean the glass awning, particularly when she was the accused’s sole domestic helper for the period of 31 May 2017 (after Carrell left) to 18 June 2017 (before PW3 joined). It was noted that _Exhibit D4_ which set out PW4’s scope of duties was comprehensive and detailed and purports to cover her entire workday from the time she wakes up to her bedtime. Therefore, in following the list of duties, PW4 would have had no time to even clean the glass awning as she would have been busy with her childcare duties. This was particularly so as, shortly after PW4 commenced her employment, the accused had given birth to her third child on 8 May 2017. It was the Defence’s case that PW4 would therefore have been expected to assist the accused in the care of two young children and a newborn that it would have taken up considerable time.

143    It was highlighted that according to PW4, Carrell’s demonstration of how to clean the glass awning occurred on either 1 May 2017 (i.e. “_the next day_” after PW4 started work on 30 April 2017) or 2 May 2017 (i.e. “_the following day_”) and the first alleged occasion occurred “_a few days later_” placing it between around 4 May 2017 and 8 May 2017. It was submitted that given that PW4 was at that time relatively inexperienced and at any rate getting up to speed with the house and with her comprehensive list of chores, it completely defied belief that PW4 would have had the time or the need to clean the glass awning so soon after Carrell’s live demonstration.

144    It was submitted that moreover, PW4 had testified in examination-in-chief that during her approximately 19-day period as the accused’s sole helper, she was so overwhelmed with work that she felt like quitting her job. As such, it was further submitted that it was inconceivable that PW4 would have been able to find time to clean the glass awning on top of attending to her primary duties (i.e. childcare), whether as one of two domestic helpers or as the sole domestic helper.

#### iv.   PW4’s oral testimony conflicts with an earlier statement (P17) given by her to the MOM

145    It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s oral testimony differs from her statement in _Exhibit P17_. It was submitted that most notable is the following excerpt:

> “2.    Q1) Out of the 5 times that you have cleaned the glass ceiling, you mentioned that Ma’am have only communicated with you 2 times. Please elaborate what was being communicated during this 2 occasions.

> 3.    A1) During the first occasion that Ma’am communicated with me which was sometime in the last week of May 2017, she told me that she needs me to clean the glass ceiling as she has visitors coming over. She did not specify to me how to clean it. She only told me to get it clean up as it was dirty.

> 4.    The second occasion that Ma’am communicated with me was sometime in early June 2017. Ma’am told me to clean the glass ceiling as there is squirrel poo. She did not specify to me how to clean it.”

As can be seen from the above, PW4 did not correct the recording officer who had asked her the question as above. It was the Defence’s case that PW4 had previously told the MOM that she had cleaned the glass awning five times and/or that PW4 in any event did not disagree with the premise that she had cleaned the glass awning five times.

146    It was submitted that PW4 had testified at trial just four months after making the statement at _Exhibit P17_ that she had cleaned the glass awning four times instead of five was therefore telling. It was also noteworthy that whereas PW4 was able to at least give a rough estimate of when key events occurred in _Exhibit P17_, she could not do so at all in the witness box. According to the Defence, this points to selective memory on the part of PW4 and the general unreliability and inconsistency prevalent in her testimony.

#### v.   PW4’s testimony was completely uncorroborated

147    It was the Defence’s case that no other Prosecution witness testified that the accused had witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning. It was submitted that PW2 who testified that she had seen both PW4 and Carrell atop the glass awning, admitted that she did not know for a fact that the accused had asked or instructed either of them to climb on top of the glass awning. In addition, it was not in PW2’s evidence that the accused had witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning.

148    It was further submitted that PW3, the Prosecution’s remaining factual witness had testified that she had witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning on one occasion (i.e. the fourth alleged occasion) but made no mention whatsoever of the accused also having witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning. It was the case for the Defence that the fact that PW4’s allegations in respect of Scenario 3 was totally uncorroborated lends further credence to the Defence’s submission that said allegations are unreliable and ought not to be believed.

#### vi.   Conclusion on the lack of credibility and reliability of PW4 as a witness

149    It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s narrative that she had prior to the fourth alleged occasion cleaned the glass awning three times in the period from either 1 May 2017 (i.e. “_the next day_” after PW4 started work on 30 April 2017) or 2 May 2017 (i.e. “_the following day_”) to 18 June 2017 was extremely far-fetched given the overwhelming evidence showing that such frequent cleaning was not needed at all.

150    It was submitted that considering that her narrative was plagued by numerous internal and external inconsistencies, the Court should find that rather than simply being forgetful or mistaken, PW4 was in fact, attempting to mislead the Court by painting an untrue picture of events. Accordingly, the Defence invited the Court to totally disregard PW4’s evidence, or accord it at most minimal weight.

## B.   The accused’s evidence that she never saw PW4 atop the glass awning should be believed

151    It was the Defence’s case that the accused had never at any point saw PW4 atop the glass awning. The accused’s testimony on this point was as follows[^19]:

> “ Q    Did you find out or did you see her clean the glass awning?

> A    I’ve never seen her or anyone.”

152    It was submitted that the accused’s testimony that she never saw PW4 or any of her other domestic helpers on top of the glass awning should be believed by the Court because it gels with circumstantial evidence and because the accused was a credible, reliable and consistent witness.

#### i.   The accused was very unlikely to have been in a position to notice PW4 atop the glass awning at all material times

153    It was the Defence’s case that the accused could only have as alleged, witnessed PW4 cleaning the glass awning atop it if she was at or very near the laundry area at the rear of the house. It was submitted that the circumstantial evidence shows that it is unlikely that the accused was in such an area or position at the material times.

154    It was further submitted that as to where a person can see another person standing on the glass awning from, the Defence had referred to _Exhibit D6_, a photograph taken from the living room of the House. It was submitted that a person seeking to climb onto the glass awning would have to pass through the glass door in the centre of _Exhibit D6_ (a closer view of which glass door can be found in _Exhibit P2_ and _Exhibit D9_) leading into the laundry area at the rear of the house.

155    It was submitted that it could be seen from _Exhibit D6_ that only by standing very near the glass door can someone properly see if anyone is on the glass awning. A person standing or sitting any further is very likely to have her view blocked by, variously, a kitchen sink, a table and items on top of the table. The further one moves away from the glass door, the worse one’s view of the scenes behind the door gets.

156    It was the Defence’s case that at all material times, the accused would have been extremely occupied with her childcare and thus would have had neither the time nor the reason to be near the laundry area where she could witness PW4 cleaning the glass awning atop it. It was submitted that the accused is a mother of three children. Her youngest child was born on 8 May 2017, about eight days after PW4 had begun working for her.

157    It was highlighted that it was not disputed that the accused was in hospital for a few days after giving birth to her youngest child nor was it disputed that upon returning home from the hospital, the accused had “_lived in the basement of the house for more than a month_”. It was also not disputed that the basement “_had the bathroom, shower, pantry, fridge and a bed and a TV and the baby’s cot_”. It was submitted that this meant that the accused could care for her youngest child and carry out almost all of her daily activities there.

158    It was further submitted that on top of caring for her youngest child, the accused had to look after her two older children, aged around 4 and 3 at the material time. The demands of motherhood would have undoubtedly taken up the vast majority of the accused’s waking hours then. It was the Defence’s case that the likelihood of the accused being at the glass door at the rear of the house, or indeed away from the basement at all, at the times on which the second and third alleged occasions are claimed to have taken place to have sighted PW4 on the glass awning was extremely low.

#### ii.   The accused was a credible witness and her evidence should be preferred to that of PW4

159    It was the Defence’s case that as the only persons in a position to give direct evidence on whether _both_ the second and third alleged occasions happened were PW4 and the accused, it was submitted that the accused was a credible and reliable witness whose oral testimony should be believed by the Court and preferred to the evidence of PW4.

160    It was further submitted that on the stand, the accused had given answers that were quick yet measured, and would readily make concessions even if they seemed unfavourable to her. In contrast to PW4, the accused was ready with coherent explanations to questions asked of her in cross-examination, such as why her domestic helpers tended to work for her for a year or less and why she had not specifically stated in her lists of chores that her domestic helpers were only to clean the interiors of certain windows.

161    It was the Defence’s case that in view of her forthrightness and her clear and consistent evidence, the accused was a reliable and credible witness whose evidence should be believed by the Court.

#### iii.   The accused’s testimony, at least in respect of the third alleged occasion was corroborated by DW2’s evidence

162    It was submitted that DW2 had testified that, contrary to the allegations made by PW4 in describing the third alleged occasion, she had never seen or otherwise noticed PW4 atop the glass awning. This corroborated the accused’s denial of PW4’s account of the third alleged occasion. It was reiterated by the Defence that PW4 was a witness of extremely low credibility.

163    It was further submitted that based on the consistent and coherent accounts of the accused and DW2, PW4’s account of the third alleged occasion was a complete fiction insofar as it purports to include the accused and DW2 as eyewitnesses.

#### iv.   Conclusion on the credibility of the accused in comparison to PW4

164    It was submitted that on the issue of whether the accused had witnessed PW4 climbing atop the glass awning, there were two main narratives: PW4’s and the accused’s. It was the Defence’s case that whereas PW4’s the entirety of her testimony was inconsistent, incoherent and incredible, the accused’s testimony was believable, was corroborated and accords with circumstantial evidence.

165    On this basis, it was submitted that the Court should prefer the accused’s testimony over PW4’s testimony and find that the accused had never at any point witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning.

## VI.   Alternative scenario – why the accused cannot be said to have “allowed” PW4 to climb the glass awning in any event

166    It was submitted for completeness and to show that the accused never at any point “allowed” PW4 to climb the glass awning, the Defence suggested two possible alternative scenarios which the Prosecution might adopt.

167    It was the Defence’s case that the premise of the first alternative scenario was as follows: without having ever taught or instructed Carrell to employ any particular method for cleaning the glass awning, the accused had instructed PW4 to learn how to clean the house from Carrell and Carrell taught PW4, _inter alia_ to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it without the accused knowing or being aware of this. It was submitted that in such scenario, the accused cannot be said to have “allowed” PW4 to climb atop the glass awning.

168    It was highlighted that one can only be said to have “allowed” something if one has knowledge of that thing. Hence, if the accused was not aware or did not know of the cleaning method taught by Carrell to PW4 she cannot be said to have “allowed” PW4 to use this method.

169    The second alternative scenario was one where the accused had given PW4 a general instruction to clean the glass awning without specifying the method to be used, and PW4 had taken it upon herself to carry out the said cleaning by standing atop the glass awning without the accused’s knowledge.

170    Again, it was submitted that in such scenario, the accused cannot be said to have “allowed” PW4 to climb atop the glass awning given her lack of knowledge of PW4’s act of doing so.

## VII.   PW4 climbed the glass awning on her own volition

171    Having set out the above, it was the Defence’s case that it was more probable than not that PW4 had climbed onto the glass awning to clean it of her own volition, without giving much thought to her safety. It was submitted that the accused cannot be held liable for the reckless actions of a foreign domestic worker.

172    It was emphasised that PW4’s employment with the accused was her first job as a foreign domestic worker in Singapore.She was not an experienced domestic worker. It was highlighted that in her evidence, PW4 had disclosed that prior to her employment, she underwent a safety training course conducted by the MOM. This course, it was submitted, would be similar to the training course undergone by PW3, in which domestic helpers were trained in how to carry out potentially higher-risk tasks such as hanging clothes using bamboo poles and cleaning windows without grilles in high-rise buildings (tasks more commonly found in HDB flats and/or high-rise apartments as opposed to private landed properties). PW3 gave evidence that the MOM course did not cover the topic of how to clean glass awnings in landed properties. It was the Defence’s case that accordingly, PW4 would also not have learnt specifically the safety issues on cleaning glass awnings in a landed property in the MOM course.

173    It was submitted that given her lack of experience and the lack of specific MOM training on cleaning glass awnings, it is more probable than not that PW4 had taken it upon herself to climb onto the glass awning to clean it, perhaps thinking that this was acceptable and without giving much regard to her own safety. It was further submitted that according to PW4, PW2 had seen her atop the glass awning on one occasion prior to the fourth alleged occasion and PW2 had already informed her that this was unsafe. Despite this, PW4 did not voice out her concerns to the accused or even her agent, PW6 and again climbed onto the glass awning on at least one other occasion as captured in _Exhibit P13_. It was the Defence’s case that this evidences PW4’s reckless mindset where she acted on her own volition with scant regard as to her own safety.

174    It was highlighted that in the meantime, PW4 had expressed her desire for a transfer of employers to both PW2 and PW3 prior to the incident where _Exhibit P13_ was captured. It was submitted that PW3 in particular elaborated that a factor behind PW4 desire to transfer employers was because PW4 did not get along with her. It was further submitted that it was thus with this desire to transfer employers that PW4 had climbed atop the glass awning in late June 2017 as captured in _Exhibit P13_. When she was spotted by PW2 and PW3 on this occasion, PW4 had taken the opportunity to ask PW2 to take a photograph of her on the glass awning and to send the photograph to MOM in the belief that this would facilitate a job transfer. The photograph _Exhibit P13_ had ended up going viral on social media, and eventually came to the attention of MOM.

175    It was the Defence’s case that the accused cannot be liable for the reckless actions of a new foreign domestic worker who has demonstrated little regard for her own safety. The accused did not instruct PW4 to climb onto the glass awning, and neither did she at anytime see PW4 climb onto the glass awning. It was submitted that there was no basis for the charge to be brought against the accused.

## Conclusion

176    It was submitted that it is trite law that the burden lies on the Prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that only if this burden is discharged can the accused be convicted. In _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[53\], V K Rajah J (as he then was), in proposing a working definition of the term “reasonable doubt”, relied on the following passage from _R v Brydon_ \[1995\] 2 BCLR (3d) 343:

> “\[I\]t is difficult to think of a more accurate statement than that which defines reasonable doubt as a doubt for which one can give a reason, so long as the reason given is logically connected to the evidence.”

177    It was further submitted that in attempting to discharge its burden, the Prosecution had relied almost entirely on the uncorroborated evidence of an unreliable witness whose evidence was inconsistent and extremely economical with the truth and was contradicted by far more credible evidence given by both the Defence and Prosecution witnesses. On this basis it was the Defence’s case that there were plenty of reasons to doubt the Prosecution’s case.

178    Accordingly, it was submitted that as the Prosecution had not proven its case to the requisite standard, the case against the accused must be dismissed and the accused acquitted.

## F.   The Prosecution’s Reply

179    In its Reply submissions, it was submitted that the Defence’s Closing Submissions had painted an inaccurate and incomplete version of the evidence adduced during the trial of the accused. In response, the Prosecution made the following submissions:

## I.   PW4 gave direct evidence

180    It was highlighted that the Defence had argued in their Closing Submissions that the Prosecution has sought to use Carrell Dela Cruz (“Kay”)’s out-of-court statement to prove that the accused had instructed her to clean the glass awning by standing on it. It was submitted that contrary to the Defence’s contention, PW4 had very much given direct evidence about the fact that Kay had told her that it was the accused who had given Kay instructions to clean the glass awning by climbing out of the glass panel partition.

181    It was further submitted that the Defence had propounded the argument that PW4’s testimony must have fallen foul of section 62(1) EA. Contrary to their argument, the Prosecution wishes to draw this Honourable Court’s attention to section 62(1) of the EA:

![]([2020] SGMC 0019_Image/[2020] SGMC 0019_image6.png)

182    It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4 had heard directly from Kay on the manner to clean the glass awning. Even if such were to be deemed hearsay evidence, in _Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor_, it was clearly established at \[970\] that:

> “It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement. **It is not hearsay and is admissible when it is to establish by evidence, not the truth of the statement**.

183    On this premise, it was argued that the purpose of using Kay’s statement was not to prove that the accused had indeed told Kay to clean on the glass awning, but rather the fact that Kay made that statement, and such direct evidence was duly given so by PW4.

184    It was highlighted that the Defence also submitted that there is ‘no evidence whatsoever’ that the accused had taught Kay to climb the glass awning to clean it. It was submitted that the Defence has omitted to acknowledge the fact that PW4 was a witness of fact, and she has testified in court to give her evidence.

## II.   Prosecution had expended all efforts to secure Kay’s attendance in Singapore, and no adverse inference should be drawn against it for failing to produce Kay

185    In response to the Defence’s submissions that the Prosecution should have “exercised greater effort”, it was submitted that in _Gimpex Ltd v Unity Holdings Business Ltd_[^20] the court observed that merely alleging that the witness was unavailable is not adequate. Instead, it must be established that firstly, the witness was not in Singapore _and_ secondly, it would not be practicable to secure the attendance of the said witness in Singapore.

186    It was the Prosecution’s case that it had shown during the course of trial that reasonable steps had been taken to contact Kay to assist in investigations and give testimony in court. It was submitted that there was therefore clear and unequivocal proof of Kay’s unavailability. When investigations first commenced, PW1 attempted to contact Kay by retrieving her overseas contact details from the employment agency responsible for emplacing Kay with the accused. After receiving the said information, PW1 was initially successful in her attempt to contact Kay, but was unable to remain in contact with her thereafter.

187    When PW5 took over the case from PW1, she did not cease to attempt contacting Kay. In fact, PW5 had also testified that she had attempted to speak to Kay on the phone on two occasions and based on _Exhibit P18_, Kay had initially communicated to PW5 that she was willing to return to Singapore to testify in court if her expenses were covered. PW5 had informed Kay that she would get back to her on this. However, subsequently, in October 2019, when PW5 tried to contact her again to make the necessary arrangements, she was unsuccessful in all four attempts. In this regard, both PW1 and PW5 had taken steps, and had been consistently keeping track of tracing Kay.

188    It was submitted that on this premise, the Prosecution had shown that it had expended all efforts to contact Kay and that it was impracticable to secure Kay’s attendance in Singapore after being continuously uncontactable despite PW5’s attempts to reach her. It was further submitted that the Prosecution did not at any point attempt to avail themselves of section 32 EA, contrary to what was submitted by Defence.

## III.   Defence’s case built on mere assumptions

189    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence had arrived at many inaccurate conclusions by assuming certain facts in their Closing Submissions. Firstly, the Defence submitted that Kay would have given evidence that the accused had never taught her to clean the glass awning by standing on top of it. It was submitted that this submission was a mere supposition and assumption that Kay would be giving evidence to support the Defence’s case theory when in actual fact, Kay was not present to testify and give her version of the facts in court.

190    It was further submitted that the Defence went on to make another baseless assumption about Kay giving evidence in court in a manner consistent with the Defence’s submission. The fact of the matter was that Kay was not in court, and making mere assumptions about what Kay would have testified carries absolutely no weight and it was submitted that this should not be accepted by the Court.

191    It was submitted that the Defence also made a bare assumption that the accused _would have_ been extremely occupied with her children and would have no time to be near the laundry area to have witnessed PW4 cleaning the glass awning. However, it is humbly submitted that the accused and DW2 have testified and in fact, admitted that they would be in the kitchen during meal times.

192    It was highlighted that the Defence had submitted that PW4 did not correct the recording officer when she questioned PW4 on cleaning the glass awning five times. It was submitted that this was yet another assumption that it must be five times by the Defence when PW4 said that she cleaned the glass awning four times.

## IV.   Defence’s inaccurate version of events are not supported by evidence adduced in court

193    It was highlighted that the Defence had submitted that it would be inconceivable for the accused to have singled out Kay to be the only domestic helper to clean the glass awning by climbing on top of it. It was submitted that Kay was not the only helper to have been instructed by the accused to clean the glass awning. During the course of trial, PW3 had testified that although the accused had not given her specific instructions as to the manner on how the glass awning was to be cleaned, the accused had told PW3 that PW4 would be the one to teach her to clean the glass awning.

## V.   The accused was particular about cleanliness

194    It was highlighted that it was submitted by the Defence that the accused would prioritise the cleaning of surfaces and items that her children came into contact with. Yet, the accused had testified that she is not particular about the cleanliness of the house where she or the children would not be able to touch. If indeed the accused was telling the truth, then there was no reason for her domestic helpers to have a daily and monthly routine which involves cleaning to the core on all parts of the house where she or her children will not usually touch, for example, the inside of cupboards even on the top floor, which was actually the guest rooms, the inside of the fridge (they were required to clean both the kitchen fridge and the basement fridge, on a weekly basis) and the external walls of the residence.

## VI.   The Defence Exhibits D1 to D3 do not form any basis to a reasonable conclusion

195    It was highlighted that the Defence had also argued that it could be concluded from _Exhibit D1_ to _Exhibit D3_ that the glass awning could be cleaned simply so long as rain pours onto the glass awning. It was submitted that this was another assumption that the Defence was making in order to support its case theory that the glass awning would have been cleaned for as long as the rain falls onto the glass awning. It was the Prosecution’s case that _Exhibit D1_ to _Exhibit D3_ do not conclusively show or depict that the rain would consistently and effectively be able to clean all dirt from the glass awning.

196    It was further submitted that the crucial question to be asked is then – What about having to clean the glass awning on non-rainy days? How would the glass awning be cleaned? During the course of trial, PW3 had testified that it would not be possible to clean the full length of the glass awning by standing at the laundry area and using a mop as it was not long enough. PW4 had also testified that it was necessary for her to climb out of the glass panel partition in order to fully remove the squirrel excrements and clean the glass awning in its entirety.

197    The Prosecution submits that PW4 had cleaned the glass awning by standing on the glass awning and the accused allowed her to do so when she saw her on the second and third occasion. As she was not stopped, PW4 had continued the cleaning of the glass awning in the same manner on the fourth occasion.

## VII.   PW4 was a consistent and reliable witness

198    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence had attempted to paint PW4 as an inconsistent, unreliable and evasive witness for the following reasons:

> a)     PW4 was unable to recall key dates;

> b)     PW4 was confused with the time when the accused gave birth.

It was submitted that the incident occurred in 2017, about two and a half years ago to the date of the trial. In this respect, it was entirely possible that PW4 would not have recalled the exact dates which she had cleaned the glass awning due to the passage of time. It was further submitted that cleaning the glass awning was merely one of the many other chores, which PW4 had been tasked to do. This should therefore not destroy PW4’s credibility, as she had been consistent throughout describing each event leading up on each occasion.

199    It was the Prosecution’s case that her inability to recall the exact dates highlights that she was not plotting to frame the accused as being culpable. It was submitted that it would have been strange for her to remember each and every single one of the dates she cleaned the glass awning, which was supposed to be a routine task for her. It was highlighted that the Defence had submitted that PW4 was able to give key events that occurred in _Exhibit P17_ but could not do so in the witness box, therefore she has a selective memory. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was not entirely clear from the Defence’s submissions on what key event is he was referring to when her testimony was consistent with _Exhibit P17_.

200    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence’s submission that PW4 had been evasive as a witness was entirely misconceived. It would be entirely unfair to describe PW4 to be evasive simply because PW4 was unable to recall the number of times she had cleaned the glass awning. In fact, it was submitted that a genuine lapse of memory would not inevitably lead to the conclusion that PW4’s entire testimony should be rejected. In the case of _Public Prosecutor v Ang Jwee Herng[^21]_, it was observed that:

> “It is trite law after all that in weighing the evidence of witnesses, the court recognises and accepts that human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is often-time inevitable. It does not mean however the whole of a witness\` testimony should be rejected simply because certain parts of it may be technically inaccurate due to a genuine lapse of memory.”

201    In this regard, it was shown during the course of trial that PW4 had been generally consistent throughout her testimony and for this matter, PW4 should not be punished or penalised for being unable to remember every single detail of her daily duties and chores. It was highlighted that the Defence had argued that the Court should not believe PW4’s explanation for failing to mention PW2 when she was asked as to who had seen her standing on the glass awning on the occasions. It was submitted that it was in fact the Defence’s very own failure to structure the question accurately. It was further submitted that PW4, who was asked a simple question, had answered that question to the best of her ability. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence was attempting to paint an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the version of events in trying to convince the Court that PW4’s evidence was incredulous and she should be disbelieved. It was therefore unreasonable for the Defence to have submitted that PW4 “had every opportunity in her one-hour long examination-in-chief to disclose this allegation” when this was not an allegation.

202    It was highlighted that the Defence had contended that PW4 was unable to identify which of the occasions PW2 had seen her on the glass awning. It was submitted that PW4 had clearly stated that PW2 had seen her once before the photograph was taken. It was the Prosecution’s case that this was entirely consistent with PW2’s evidence that she had seen PW4 clean the glass awning once before she took the photograph uploaded onto her Facebook page.

203    It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4 did not attempt to retract her version of events. In fact, PW4 was clarifying her version due to being confused by the Defence’s convoluted line of questioning prior to this. It was submitted that there was a ring of truth that persistently peals throughout PW4’s testimony in examination-in-chief, cross-examination, and re-examination. It was further submitted that when examined carefully, the entirety of PW4’s evidence was internally consistent in its material aspects and also consistent with the extraneous circumstances.

204    It was submitted that the Defence had arrived at the conclusion that PW4 would have thought it was possible that she had cleaned the glass awning three times before 8 May 2017. Nowhere did PW4 testify in court she had cleaned the glass awning three times before 8 May 2017. It was submitted that this was merely another one of the Defence’s baseless assumptions as the Defence was taking opportunity of PW4’s lack of denial. It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4 had consistently testified in court on the facts, and the truth according to the best of her memory. She had not lied to the court and has stated that she was unable to recall the specific details of each occasion. Further, the Defence had argued that PW4 was being economical about the truth of the events and that it was most unlikely that PW2 had told PW4 that she had seen many others clean the glass awning. The basis for this argument was that PW2 had testified that she had seen only Kay and PW4 clean the glass awning. Again, it was submitted that there was no good reason as to why PW4 should lie. She had just told the Court what PW2 told her.

205    It was further submitted that PW4 had clarified that she was unable to recall the exact dates as to when she cleaned the glass awning, and this was not fully captured in the excerpt produced by the Defence in its submissions. It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence carefully elected to twist PW4’s words and imputed the dates they deemed suitable to suit their version of events.

206    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence had also made an erroneous assertion about a person’s view of the balcony area from behind the glass door. It was submitted that this scenario had already been put to PW4 and she had already replied that at the material time, nobody was obstructing the view of the glass door, and this was why the accused was able to see her from inside the house.

207    It was highlighted that the Defence had submitted that it was more probably than not that PW4 had “climbed onto the glass awning of her own volition, without giving much thought to her safety.” It was submitted that there was no evidence to support this, which again remained a mere speculation of the Defence. It was further submitted that it also runs counter to the Defence’s other submission in the same section, which was that PW4 had asked PW2 to take a photograph of her on the glass awning. If indeed that had been the case, it followed that PW4 must have known that standing on the glass awning was wrong and dangerous, which would mean she was just being reckless when she climbed out to clean the glass awning on the other three occasions. It was the Prosecution’s case that it sounded ludicrous that PW4 had to stand on the glass awning on three occasions before she posed for PW2 to take a photo of her standing on the glass awning to send it to MOM.

## VIII.   PW4’s testimony was corroborated

208    It was the Prosecution’s case that the Defence had arrived at an inaccurate conclusion by submitting that PW4’s allegations in respect of Scenario 3 were uncorroborated. It was submitted that there was no reason for PW4 to be untruthful about testifying that the accused had seen her cleaning the glass awning on two separate occasions. The evidence provided by PW2 and PW3 had also supported the Prosecution’s case when it comes to Kay’s method of cleaning the glass awning. PW3, who has been in communication with Kay, had asked her about the cleaning methods and was told by Kay that climbing out of the glass panel to clean the glass awning had always been the manner which the glass awning is, to be cleaned.

## IX.   DW3 was not a credible and reliable witness

209    It was highlighted that the Defence had submitted that DW3 was ‘credible and reliable’, and ‘has no reason or motive to give favourable testimony on the accused’s behalf. It was submitted that contrary to the Defence’s submission, it was clearly established that during the course of trial, DW3 had initially described the accused as a ‘disciplined’ and ‘humble’ person. However, when she was confronted with her statement in court, where she said that the accused was very strict and that was why she wanted to transfer, she agreed with the Prosecution that the contents of the statement were true and that the accused was very strict.

210    It was further submitted that it was important to note that DW3’s current employer is the accused’s good friend. In this respect, DW3 proved to be an unreliable witness, only agreeing with the Prosecution when her previous statement given to MOM was read out to her in court. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was obvious from DW3’s testimony that she was trying to protect the accused as the accused is her current employer’s good friend.

## X.   DW2 has every reason and motive to protect the accused

211    It was submitted that DW2, being the accused’s mother, has every reason and motive to protect her daughter and ensure that she does not get into trouble.

## CONCLUSION

212    It was the Prosecution’s case that in its Closing Submissions, the Defence had sought to paint an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the evidence adduced at trial. Further, the Defence had consistently attempted to portray PW4 as an inconsistent witness, having made bare assumptions and mere speculations to support its Defence. In contrast, the evidence adduced from the Prosecution witnesses showed that the accused being bound by the work permit conditions had contravened Condition 2, Part I of the Fourth Schedule, Employment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations 2012 and allowed PW4 to clean the glass awning, located above the patio area by standing directly on the glass awning.

213    With the foregoing factors, it was submitted that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and the Court was urged to convict the accused of the proceeded charge.

## G.   The Defence’s Reply

214    It was the Defence’s case that from the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions, it was apparent that the Prosecution sought for the Court to:

> (a)     believe PW4’s version of the facts above all others; and

> (b)     infer that, based on PW4’s version of the facts, the accused must have somehow “allowed” PW4 to climb the glass awning at the rear of the house.

215    The Defence had noted the Prosecution’s concession that the only witness giving direct evidence of the accused purportedly having “allowed” PW4 to do so was PW4 herself. As such, it must be that if the Court finds that PW4’s evidence was unreliable, any finding that the accused had “allowed” PW4 to climb the glass awning was precluded. In this connection, it was submitted that the Court should wholly reject and disregard the evidence of PW4 and accordingly acquit the accused of the charge against her for the following reasons:

> (a)     the evidence of PW4 was completely unreliable and

> (b)     in contrast, the evidence of the accused was consistent, coherent and corroborated and therefore preferable to that of PW4.

216    At the outset, it was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s statement of the undisputed facts in its Closing Submissions was incorrect. In particular, it was highlighted that PW4’s duties or “household chores” primarily entailed looking after the accused’s children. It was PW4’s own evidence that the accused gave her detailed instructions on how to perform these duties.

217    It was submitted that the Prosecution’s submission on the witnesses giving direct evidence of the occasions on which PW4 allegedly stood atop the glass awning was also incorrect. The witnesses who gave direct evidence of whether PW4 had stood on the glass awning on the four alleged occasions were PW4, the accused, DW2, PW3 and PW2.

218    It was further submitted that when the testimonies of PW4 and the accused, the key Prosecution and Defence witnesses respectively were pitted against one another, it was clear that the accused’s evidence was preferable as it was consistent and corroborated whereas PW4’s evidence was highly suspect in that it was not only internally inconsistent but contradicted in several respects by the evidence of the other witnesses including the Prosecution witnesses.

219    It was submitted that PW4’s evidence on the key events taking place at the material times was unreliable and ought to be disregarded entirely because:

> (a)     it contains a litany of internal inconsistencies on key details such as dates and purported eyewitnesses;

> (b)     it is contradicted by the evidence of _other Prosecution witnesses_ and even an _earlier statement made by PW4 herself_;

> (c)     it flies in the face of all evidence showing that the glass awning did not require frequent cleaning at all; and

> (d)     it remained completely uncorroborated.

## I.   The Prosecution’s submissions that PW4 purportedly had no motive to lie are entirely misconceived

220    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s argument that PW4 must have been truthful as she had no motive to lie was entirely misconceived. The proposition that a person who lacks a motive to lie is necessarily credible is completely illogical. It was submitted that in _Geyabalan s/o K Ramiah and another v PP[^22]_, See Kee Oon JC (as he then was), in finding that the evidence of a Prosecution witness was unreliable despite the said witness having no motive to lie, made the following observation at \[28\]:

> “However, that PW9 did not have a motive to falsely implicate the Appellants does not necessarily mean that he did not in fact do so, or that his evidence should be deemed credible or cogent. It cannot mean that his evidence should be accepted wholesale. In other words, motive and conduct ought not to be conflated.”

It was highlighted that as See Kee Oon JC had explained at \[47\] of _Geyabalan v PP_, it was because his evidence contained material inconsistencies and lacked detail that the Prosecution witness was considered unreliable:

> “… I do not find PW9 a credible or reliable witness given the material discrepancies in his evidence, both internal and external. While PW9’s demeanour as assessed by the trial judge may have been that of a credible witness, this does not change the fact that his evidence is inconsistent and lacking in particulars. He was not able to recall details of the offence despite his assertions that he had personally witnessed the other accomplices taking jewellery from passengers’ baggage. He also gave inconsistent evidence on the identity and number of persons involved in the alleged offences. More importantly, his evidence lacks specificity and detail as to the dates and times on which the alleged thefts took place and as to what items were stolen.

221    Hence, the Defence disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the question of whether PW4 has a motive to lie was “_critical to the issue_” of her credibility and honesty and would instead submit that following _Geyabalan v PP_, the critical issue is: _did PW4 in fact lie?_ On this point, the Defence reiterated that it was clear from the record that PW4’s testimony was peppered with falsehoods. It was the Defence’s case that much of the statements or assertions given by PW4 were demonstrably untrue.

**(a) As to when Carrell gave PW4 the alleged demonstration of how to clean the glass awning:**

(i)    PW4 had testified that the demonstration was given “_the next day_” after her start date of 30 April 2017 (i.e. 1 May 2017); and

(ii)       PW4 later testified that the demonstration was given “_the following day after that_” (i.e. 2 May 2017).

**(b) As to when the first alleged occasion occurred:**

(i)    PW4 testified that it occurred “_the next day_” after Carrell’s alleged demonstration of how to clean the glass awning; and

(ii)       PW4 later testified that it occurred “_a few days_” after the said demonstration.

**(c) As to when the fourth alleged occasion occurred:**

(i)    PW4 agreed with counsel for the Defence that it occurred at the end of June 2017 and

(ii)       PW4 later positively stated that it occurred on 4 July 2017.

**(d) As to who had witnessed the fourth alleged occasion:**

(i)    PW4 agreed that the accused, DW2 and Carrell were “_around_” and

(ii)       PW4 later denied having so agreed (despite the record showing otherwise).

222    It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s evidence was contradicted in several material respects by both direct and circumstantial evidence given by both Prosecution and Defence witnesses, the specifics of which had been set out in the Defence’s Closing Submissions. It was submitted that in view of PW4’s selective memory, poor recollection, evasiveness and, as demonstrated above, dishonesty, the inescapable conclusion was that PW4’s testimony was unreliable and should be disregarded.

223    It was the Defence’s case that in seeking to prove that PW4 had no motive to lie, the Prosecution relied on _PW4’s own assertion_ that she does not have anything against the accused such that she would give false testimony against her. It was submitted that it was absurd and circular to attempt to prove a lack of bias on the part of a witness by relying on that witness’s own statement that she was unbiased.

224    The Defence highlighted the following observation made by Yong Pung How CJ at \[39\] of _Loo See Mei v PP[^23]_:

> “First, when a trial judge wishes to make a finding that the complainant or prosecution witness had no reason to falsely implicate the accused, he must base such a finding on credible evidence. This is founded on the principle of common sense that any finding of a trial judge must be based on some credible evidence to support his or her decision in order for that finding to be sound.”

It was submitted that given the many inconsistencies and falsehoods present, PW4’s evidence can hardly be said to be “credible evidence”, whether in general or for the specific purpose of “proving” that PW4 had no motive to lie.

225    It was submitted that the Prosecution had mischaracterised the Defence’s case in its Closing Submissions. It was the Defence’s case that PW4 (this being her first job) had decided on her own to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it. Despite allegedly being told by PW2 that this was dangerous, PW4 continued doing so. By the time _Exhibit P13_ was captured, PW4 had long harboured thoughts of transferring her employment. It just so happened that PW2 witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning. It was there and then that PW4 opportunistically suggested that PW2 take her photograph (which is corroborated by PW2’s and PW3’s testimonies that the person to first broach the idea of having her photograph taken was PW4 herself) and send it to the MOM, believing that this would help facilitate a job transfer.

226    It was further submitted that it was not the Defence’s case that PW4 had deliberately chose a dangerous method of implicating the accused. Rather, it was the Defence’s case that PW4, knowing that PW2 thought of her act as dangerous, formed the idea for PW2 to take a photograph of her in the midst of such act and send the photograph to MOM, believing that as a result of MOM acting on it, she would secure a transfer of employers. As such, it was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s reliance on the passage from _PP v Muhammad Idris bin Basiran[^24]_ was misplaced.

227    Regarding the Prosecution’s use of the word “_pose_”, it was submitted that same was misconceived. It was not the Defence’s case that PW4 made it look as though she was cleaning just so that her photograph could be taken. It was further submitted that nowhere in her testimony did PW6 distinguish between the “_initial stage_” of PW4’s employment with the accused and thereafter. Rather, PW6 had testified that she saw PW4 every two weeks after PW4 took up employment with the accused.

228    It was reiterated that it was the Defence’s case that PW4 stood on top of the glass awning of her own volition. Even if she had been taught to do so in the manner described by Carrell (which is not admitted), the accused cannot be held responsible for same. There was no evidence whatsoever that the accused was aware of any method of cleaning the glass awning having been passed down to PW4 . It was highlighted that it was PW4’s evidence that she would help PW3 with her chores when she had “_free time_”. It was submitted that this shows that PW4 was able to complete her scope of assigned duties on time and/or otherwise had time to assist PW3 with her work.

## II.   PW4’s testimony does not bear the ‘ring of truth’ whatsoever

229    It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s argument that PW4’s account must be believed just because she did not say that it was the accused who had instructed her to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it must be rejected by the Court. It was reiterated that the Prosecution’s description regarding the circumstances of the four alleged occasions, PW4’s evidence of the account of the key events was confused, inconsistent and incoherent, and ought to be entirely disbelieved. It was further reiterated that all “evidence” that the method of cleaning the glass awning by climbing atop it originated from the accused was hearsay evidence and should thus be disregarded.

230    The Defence had noted the inconsistency between on one hand, PW4 declining to complain about the danger of climbing atop the glass awning for fear of losing her job and on the other hand, (i) PW4 complaining to the accused that she could not cope with being the accused’s sole domestic helper and (ii) PW4 letting a stranger into the house (which, it is submitted, equally could have resulted in PW4 losing her job). It was submitted that this exposed PW4’s stated reason for not complaining about climbing the glass awning as a lame excuse designed to cover up the fact that she had done so entirely of her own volition.

231    It was reiterated that it was PW4’s evidence that the first alleged occasion on which she cleaned the glass awning occurred “_the next day_” or “_a few days_” after Carrell’s alleged demonstration of how to clean the glass awning. It was also reiterated by the Defence that the glass awning subjectively and objectively did not require frequent cleaning at all. Thus, even if it was accepted that PW3 felt the need to clean the glass awning once a week, it must be emphasised that her method of doing so involved simply pouring water onto the glass awning and using a mop which PW3 had testified could not reach the entire surface of the glass awning.

232    It was the Defence’s case that it was one thing for PW3 to believe that she needed to clean half the glass awning every week. For PW4 to have allegedly thoroughly cleaned the glass awning by standing atop it four times in little more than a month (the first time allegedly being just days after Carrell’s step-by-step demonstration) was unbelievable. It was highlighted that the accused’s evidence that the glass awning was not dirty despite not having been cleaned in the last one year went unchallenged. All the more this casted doubt on the idea that the glass awning needed weekly or frequent cleaning.

233    It was emphasised that regardless of what PW2 had seen or heard, it was PW2’s evidence that she did not know for a fact whether the accused had asked PW4 to climb atop the glass awning. It was submitted that the testimony of PW4 did not bear a ring of truth whatsoever and in fact in its most material respects, PW4’s testimony was _contradicted_ rather than corroborated by the evidence of PW2 and PW3.

234    It was the Defence’s case that throughout the course of trial, PW4 had sought to paint herself as an obedient domestic helper. It must be recalled that it was PW4’s own evidence that she picked a rainy day to clean the glass awning because DW2 had directed her to do so in the interests of saving water (which was denied). It was thus clear from PW4’s response to the above question that PW4 was seeking to convince the Court that she was so co-operative and/or desirous of keeping her job that she would even follow directions given by her employer’s mother. It was submitted that PW4’s conduct, wherein she admitted allowing her male friend into the house despite a rule against same being in place, clearly indicated that even at the risk of losing her job, PW4 was prepared to breach the rules in her own interest.

235    It was further submitted that the Defence’s highlighting of the uneasy relationship between PW4 and PW3 was not done with the general aim of casting doubt on PW4’s credibility or character as hypothesised by the Prosecution in its Closing Submissions. Rather, it was meant to show specifically that even after the accused had hired PW3 to work together with PW4 and ease her load, PW4 still harboured intentions of transferring employment.

236    It was the Defence’s case that PW4 had every opportunity from the time of Carrell’s alleged demonstration (which per PW4 occurred before the first time the accused saw her on the glass awning) to put in the necessary complaint. It was submitted that the Prosecution’s argument that PW4 saw no point in complaining because the accused knew that she was cleaning the glass awning in this manner holds no water. It was emphasised that PW4 did not complain to her agent, PW6 during her entire term of employment with the accused.

## III.   PW4’s account was inherently incredible and internally inconsistent and does not gel with the evidence of other witnesses

237    It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s testimony was internally inconsistent and was contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses. It was submitted that the Prosecution’s portrayal of PW4’s recount of the key events was inaccurate, if not disingenuous. It was highlighted that in the Defence’s Closing Submissions, the Defence had laid out in full detail PW4’s evasiveness, selective memory and ever-changing position on the stand, and invited the Court to find that PW4 was unable to provide a consistent and coherent account of the material events.

238    It was the Defence’s case that the evidence of the Prosecution’s factual witnesses on how the photograph _Exhibit P13_ came to be taken was not a “_consistency_” as suggested by the Prosecution, but rather a major _inconsistency_ which exposed PW4’s lack of credibility as a witness. It was reiterated that both PW2 and PW3 had clearly testified that PW4 had first broached the idea of having her photograph taken. This contradicted PW4’s testimony that PW2, without prompting from PW4 “_said she will take picture and she will post_”. Given that the accounts of PW2 and PW3 (both eyewitnesses to the fourth alleged occasion) were consistent with each other, the inference must be that their version was true and, in turn, that PW4’s was inaccurate and unreliable.

239    It was submitted that the Court should find that PW4’s evidence on this point was a lie rather than simply a case of poor memory as it was PW2’s evidence that around the commencement of MOM investigations into the matter, PW4 had asked PW2 to lie and say that PW4 was not aware that _Exhibit P13_ had been taken. It was the Defence’s case that PW4 had, since the start of MOM investigations, sought to downplay her involvement in the taking of _Exhibit P13_. Her testimony on the stand that it was PW2’s suggestion for _Exhibit P13_ to be taken was further evidence of this. As it turned out, this was contradicted by PW2 and PW3 exposing PW4’s untruthfulness.

240    It was submitted that the Prosecution’s highlighting of the alleged similarity between the evidence of the three Prosecution witnesses regarding Carrell’s alleged cleaning of the glass awning was misconceived as it was largely based on hearsay evidence. Moreover, it was submitted that the evidence of PW6 could hardly be said to corroborate that of PW4.

241    It was the Defence’s case that a comparison of PW6’s evidence and PW4’s evidence further revealed PW4’s evasiveness and unreliability as a witness. When questioned on why she did not complain to PW6 about apparently having to climb onto the glass awning, her initial response was that she did not want to damage the accused’s reputation by making a complaint that could be heard by all the persons present at PW6’s agency.When it was put to her that she could have spoken to PW6 in private, PW4 gave the excuse that each time she visited the agency, PW6 would be busy attending to the many other persons present making it impossible for her to do so.

242    It was submitted that PW6 had testified that there was in fact a private room in the agency which she would “_definitely_” have made available to PW4 particularly given that it was a “_practice_” for her to meet newer domestic helpers on their off-days. It was further submitted that when it was then put to her that she could have made a telephone call to PW6, PW4’s excuse changed. This time, she said that she had been told only to complain in event of physical abuse by her employer and as such did not see the need to complain about her house chores. It was clear from the above that PW6’s testimony, rather than corroborating PW4’s evidence, exposed PW4’s stated reason for failing to complain about allegedly having to clean the glass awning in an unsafe manner as an absolute lie.

## IV.   Conclusion on PW4’s lack of credibility and reliability

243    It was the Defence’s case that as can be seen from the above and from the Defence’s Closing Submissions, PW4’s evidence was highly suspect. PW4 had narrated her version of events with apparent conviction, yet is unable to recall the most fundamental of details such as dates and eyewitnesses. Her testimony were full of statements which were questionable, if not demonstrably false. When confronted with inconsistencies and/or discrepancies in her testimony, her responses range from insisting on her truthfulness to providing feeble excuses to even accusing other witnesses of lying.

244    It was the Defence’s case that all of this was encapsulated in PW4’s reaction to being shown an entry on _Exhibit D10_ (a schedule of salary payments signed by both the accused and PW4) for the month of September 2017 which reads “_\+ $100 loan 09/07/17_”. As this entry was signed off on by PW4, the inference must be that PW4 had on 9 July 2017 taken a S$100 loan from the accused which was accordingly deducted from PW4’s September 2017 pay, which deduction was duly acknowledged by PW4 as mentioned. As it were, PW4 had denied knowledge of this entry, insisted that it was not there when she signed the relevant row in _Exhibit D10_ and had insinuated that it might have been inserted after the fact. It was submitted that even on matters with no direct bearing on the factual issues in the present matter, and even in the face of strong documentary evidence weighing against her position, it is almost second nature for PW4 to deny and deflect and, where opportune, accuse others of dishonest conduct. If PW4 cannot be trusted to be forthright on lower-stakes issues such as these, all the more her evidence on issues of real significance to the present case cannot be believed.

245    It was submitted that for the foregoing reasons as well as the reasons stated in the Defence’s Closing Submissions, it was submitted that PW4 was not a credible witness whatsoever and her evidence should be disregarded.

## V.   The accused’s evidence was consistent, coherent and reliable

246    It was the Defence’s case that unlike PW4, the accused was a credible witness whose evidence was both inherently believable and corroborated by other witnesses. It was not disputed from the accused’s own evidence that she is a detailed person who drew up lists of chores (_Exhibit D4_) to ensure that her domestic helpers understood that their tasks were not merely restricted to cleaning bedrooms and sweeping floors.

247    It was also not disputed that the accused has allergies and is a mother of three children, the youngest of whom she gave birth to on 8 May 2017, just eight days after PW4 had started working for her on 30 April 2017. It was submitted that putting everything together, the inference must be that the accused was particular about ensuring a clean, safe and hygienic living environment for herself and more so for her young children and, in keeping with her detailed nature, was prepared to spell out what she expected of her domestic helpers towards this end, particularly seeing as she herself would, during the material times, be occupied with caring for her new-born son.

248    It was further submitted that the accused’s evidence was entirely consistent with this narrative, and the Prosecution’s attempts to call into question the particular steps that the accused did or did not take was misguided. The fact that _Exhibit D4_ was not exhaustive does not take anything away from the fact that it is long and detailed, in keeping with the accused’s nature. It was the Defence’s case that the Prosecution’s submission that “_cleaning the awning was probably one such unlisted chore_” was untenable given the Prosecution’s position that the accused tended to give “_ad hoc instructions_” to her domestic helpers. If, as claimed, the glass awning required cleaning an average of once a week, this would surely have been included in _Exhibit D4_ as a weekly task.

249    It was the Defence’s case that it made eminent sense for the accused to prioritise the cleaning of surfaces / areas that she and her children come into contact with. As the glass awning was not one such area, it was submitted that it was perfectly reasonable that she was less concerned about whether and how it was cleaned. It was further submitted that the fact that the accused had specifically told her helpers to use the extendable wiper to push any animal droppings they saw on the glass awning to the middle thereof was consistent with _both_ the relative lack of importance the accused placed on having the glass awning cleaned _and_ with her practice of spelling out what she expected her domestic helpers to do. It was highlighted that if the Prosecution accepted that the accused had issued this specific instruction to use the extendable wiper to clean the glass awning, it would be inconsistent for them to then submit that the accused had also told PW4 to climb onto the glass awning to clean it.

250    It was submitted that the accused took specific steps to ensure that her domestic helpers did not clean window exteriors precisely because it was stipulated in _Exhibit D5_ and was at all material times well understood by all involved that domestic helpers were not to clean window exteriors.

251    It was not disputed that the accused had assumed that PW4 would not climb atop the glass awning and therefore did not specifically prohibit her from doing so. It was further submitted that this was a perfectly reasonable and logical assumption for the accused to make. It was PW4’s own evidence that she had prior to her employment with the accused, gone through safety training with MOM for such a situation. Hence, it was perfectly reasonable for the accused to operate on the premise that PW4 would have looked out for her own safety. It was submitted that the accused was fully justified in assuming that PW4 would have had the common sense to avoid putting her safety in jeopardy by climbing onto the glass awning.

252    It was further submitted that in any event, having been specifically prevented from cleaning the window exteriors by the accused, PW4 should have figured that the same would apply to the glass awning, at least in the unsafe manner with which she cleaned it. The fact that the accused gave the specific instruction to clean the glass awning by using an extendable wiper to push animal droppings to the middle of it further supports the Defence’s submission that PW4 ought well to have known not to climb over the glass panel and onto the awning. It was the Defence’s case that it was completely unreasonable to expect an employer in the accused’s position to expressly warn her domestic helpers against every possible potentially dangerous scenario.

253    It was reiterated by the Defence that there was no need for the entirety of the glass awning to be cleaned by hand. It was submitted that the Prosecution’s submission that a person can only clean the entirety of the glass awning by standing atop it was completely misconceived. It was denied that the accused had “_not provided any other reasonable methods_” for cleaning the glass awning and reiterated that the accused had bought an extendable wiper for this exact purpose.

254    In response to the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions, it was submitted that as a strict employer, a mother of three and a person with allergies, the accused would have wanted her domestic helpers to use their best efforts to ensure that all surfaces / areas that she and her children come into contact with are cleaned. This necessarily meant that the cleaning of the glass awning (which the accused and her children never came into contact with) would have to be deprioritised and in any event the rain and/or the extendable wiper bought by the accused for this exact purpose would do the job. It was further submitted that this was a consistent and believable account of events, and the Prosecution’s submission that the accused would have wanted her helpers to clean every inch of the glass awning by hand did not make sense and must be rejected.

255    It was submitted that the Prosecution’s description of the available cleaning equipment at the material time and the Prosecution witnesses’ evidence was incorrect. As to what equipment was available prior to the taking of _Exhibit P13_, it was PW3’s evidence that the physical _Exhibit P15_ (a white extendable wiper), or something very much like it was always available for PW3’s and PW4’s use. When asked in examination-in-chief whether she had used _Exhibit P15_, PW3’s response was that she was “_not sure_” if the implement available to her at the material time was the same as _Exhibit P15_. However, when it was shown by Counsel for the Defence in cross-examination, PW3 had remarked that something “_totally like this_” was available. Indeed, PW4 when shown _Exhibit P14_ and _Exhibit P15_ by the Prosecution in examination-in-chief had also testified that _Exhibit P15_ had always been in the house.

256    It was the Defence’s case that the occasion on which PW3 saw PW4 atop the glass awning (i.e. when _Exhibit P13_ was taken) was the same occasion as one of the two occasions on which PW2 had allegedly saw PW4 there. It was also the Defence’s case that if it was the Prosecution’s argument that the Court must conclude that the accused had seen PW4 atop the glass awning simply because they both lived in the house, the same was completely absurd and must be rejected out of hand.

257    It was reiterated by the Defence that it was for the Prosecution to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt. In view of its earlier submissions on PW4’s lack of credibility as a witness, PW4’s evidence that the accused had witnessed her standing on the glass awning must be disbelieved. Accordingly, the Defence invited the Court to find that the accused had never at any point seen PW4 atop the glass awning.

## VI.   The other Defence Witnesses were credible and reliable

258    It was the Defence’s case that on top of being inherently believable and consistent, the accused’s evidence was made all the more reliable by the fact that it is corroborated by equally reliable evidence given by the other Defence witnesses, DW2 and DW3.

#### The Prosecution’s imputations of bias on the evidence of DW2 are unfounded

259    It was submitted that DW2’s evidence on the accused’s living arrangements in the weeks after she gave birth to her third child on 8 May 2017 was entirely believable and indeed the truth. The evidence of DW2 was that aside from mealtimes (which in any event went by “_quickly_” and during which times the domestic helpers would have had to deal with the meals and as such would not have been doing any cleaning), the accused had spent her days in the basement. It was further submitted that this supported the accused’s own evidence that she spent the vast majority of her time in the basement of the house immediately after the birth of her third child.

260    It was the Defence’s case that the Court should adopt the evidence of DW2 and find that the accused would only come up to the first floor of the house to eat during the period from 8 May 2017 to at least PW3’s arrival on 19 June 2017 and as such she would not have been in any position to witness PW4 standing on top of the glass awning (if indeed she did). It was submitted that the Court should reject the Prosecution’s argument that just because she is the mother of the accused, DW2 was necessarily biased and untrustworthy as a witness.

#### The Prosecution’s imputations of bias on DW3’s part are unfounded

261    It was submitted that the Prosecution’s portrayal of DW3 as a biased and evasive witness in its Closing Submissions was unjustified and inaccurate. It was the Defence’s case that from her testimony, DW3 had never tried to hide her opinion that the accused was on top of being “_disciplined_” and “_humble_”, strict to her domestic helpers.

262    Regarding DW3’s stated reasons for wanting to transfer out of the accused’s employment, it was further submitted that both reasons (i.e. the accused’s strictness and DW3’s previous employer needing help) could be true at once and there was nothing suspicious or irregular about DW3’s testimony in this respect. It was the Defence’s case that to find that DW3 was biased in favour of a person whom she felt was “_strict_” to her and whom she in any event no longer works for was untenable.

#### Evelyn Barit Bacuyag statement was relevant in showing that the glass awning at the rear of the house was not required to be cleaned frequently at all

263    It was reiterated that Evelyn’s statement to the MOM of 13 July 2017 (_Exhibit D11_) was relevant in that it shows the following:

> (a)     during DW3’s entire stint with the accused, DW3 never cleaned the glass awning even once; and

> (b)     the glass awning in any event did not require cleaning by the accused’s domestic helpers as the rain would do the job.

264    It was submitted that _Exhibit D11_ served to support the accused’s evidence that all she needed from her domestic helpers was to use an extendable wiper to push animal droppings to the middle of the glass awning where they would be washed away by the rain and it correspondingly exposed the absurdity of PW4’s evidence that she cleaned the glass awning four times in a matter of a little more than a month. It was further submitted that this statement was relevant and should be given its due weight by the Court.

#### An adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for its failure to call Carell as a witness

265    It was reiterated by the Defence that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution for its failure to call Carrell, whom the Prosecution required to corroborate the evidence given by PW4 on _inter alia_ how she came to learn to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it, as a witness. It was submitted that the Prosecution could definitely have done much more to secure Carrell’s attendance, particularly seeing as Carrell had, more than once, expressed willingness to travel to Singapore as long as her travel expenses were covered.

266    The Defence then highlighted the following timings:

> (a)     PW1 despite having successfully reached Carrell once, decided that Carrell was uncontactable and made no further attempts to contact her all the way until her departure from the MOM in April 2019 (**1 year and 9 months** after obtaining Carrell’s contact details in July 2017);

> (b)     In PW5’s first **3 months** on the case, no attempts were made to contact Carrell whatsoever;

> (c)     In the **2½ weeks** after her first phone conversation with Carrell on 27 August 2019, PW5 did not try and contact Carrell again despite knowing that Carrell only needed assurance that her airfare would be covered to come to Singapore;

> (d)     It took more than **2½ weeks** after her second phone conversation with Carrell on 16 September 2019 for PW5 to try and follow up with Carrell.

It was the Defence’s case that it was clear from the above that even if the Prosecution had difficulty in establishing regular contact with Carrell, it had more than ample time to seek out alternative modes of contact and/or step up its efforts in trying to contact Carrell.

267    It was also highlighted that the Prosecution had never offered up Carrell to the Defence as a witness.

268    As such, it was submitted that in view of the Prosecution’s failure to act with sufficient urgency in ensuring that Carrell was available to give evidence in court, an adverse inference should be drawn against the Prosecution, and the Court should find that had Carrell testified, her testimony would have exposed PW4 as an untruthful witness and would have cast even more doubt on PW4’s evidence.

## Conclusion

269    It was the Defence’s case that as framed by the Prosecution, the Court’s decision on whether to acquit or convict the accused ultimately boiled down to whether the Court preferred the testimony of the accused or that of PW4. Given that PW4’s testimony was beset with inconsistencies, memory lapses and falsehoods, there were already legitimate doubts as to the accused’s guilt. Combined with the clear, consistent and corroborated evidence of the accused, it was submitted that the Court should find the accused not guilty of the charge against her and accordingly acquit her.

## H.   Assessment of Evidence

270    In the present case, in order to prove its case on the amended charge in _Exhibit C1D_ beyond a reasonable doubt, the Prosecution had to establish the following elements namely:

> (a)     between early June 2017 and 4 July 2017, PW4 had climbed onto the glass awning located above the patio area of the house to clean it and

> (b)     the accused had allowed PW4 to clean the glass awning in the said manner.

271    It was clear that element (a) was satisfied as it was unchallenged that PW4 had cleaned the glass awning in such a manner on at least one occasion sometime in late June 2017 to early July 2017 as captured in _Exhibit P13_ that showed PW4 standing directly on top of the glass awning moping in the rain. In addition, it was undisputed that both PW2 and PW3 had seen PW4 cleaning in such a manner on this occasion.

![]([2020] SGMC 0019_Image/[2020] SGMC 0019_image7.png)

272    From the evidence presented before me, it was clear that the main fact in issue was whether the Prosecution had proven element (b), namely that the accused had _allowed_ PW4 to climb onto the glass awning and clean it while standing on top of it, thereby endangering PW4’s safety and contravening section 22(1)(a) the EFMA. This was where the case for the Prosecution and the Defence were diametrically opposite.

273    It was the Prosecution’s case that when PW4 started working for the accused on 1 May 2017 at 22 Goldhill Avenue it was a household that consisted of the accused, her husband as well as their three young children. The accused then had an existing foreign domestic worker, one Dela Cruz Carell Cubero (“Kay”) who had worked for the accused from September 2016 to 29 May 2017. To enable PW4 to familiarise herself with her duties and as the accused was particular about cleanliness, the accused provided PW4 with the detailed lists of chores for both the ‘House Chores Maid’ and ‘Children’s Maid’. The two lists were supplemented by the Daily Tasks list, Weekly Tasks list, Fortnightly & Monthly Tasks list. In addition, Kay was tasked by the accused to teach and guide PW4 on the specifics of the household chores. According to the Prosecution, the lists were endless and had many chores listed for each of the domestic worker to do on a daily basis.

274    Apart from the various chores as listed in _Exhibit D4_, PW4 testified that the accused had told her to clean the glass awning over the patio because of the dust and squirrel droppings found on it. She was to obtain the step-by-step instructions on how to clean the glass awning from Kay. It was the Prosecution’s case that Kay had taught PW4 to clean the glass awning by climbing over to the glass awning and cleaning it with detergent powder and water while standing directly on it within a few days after PW4 started work. According to PW4, Kay was present on the first occasion when PW4 cleaned the glass awning.

275    It was the Prosecution’s case that PW4 had cleaned the glass awning in such a manner on _four occasions_ after she started work with the accused. According to PW4, the accused had seen her doing so on the second and third occasions but had not stopped her from doing so. PW4 had testified that three out of the four occasions had occurred before PW3 started working for the accused. PW4 had also testified that even though she thought that the manner that she was taught to clean was dangerous, she decided to continue cleaning in that manner without complaining as Kay told her to and she was afraid she would lose her job. Subsequently, the accused tasked PW4 to teach and guide PW3 on the household chores when latter started working for the accused on 19 June 2017. I noted that it was undisputed that PW4 had not taught PW3 to clean the glass awning in the same manner as she had been taught by Kay.

276    To establish the knowledge element, it was the Prosecution’s case that although the accused had delivered her third child in May 2017 and would spent her time at the basement of the house during her confinement period, the accused would be in the kitchen during her meal times. The Prosecution’s case theory was that as the accused and PW4 lived in the same house at the material time, the accused would have seen PW4 cleaning the glass awning by standing directly on it on the occasions when the accused went to the kitchen to have her meals.

277    To illustrate the relative location between the kitchen and the glass awning at the rear of the house, the Prosecution had adduced the photographs in _Exhibit P2_ to _Exhibit P5_ as shown below:

![]([2020] SGMC 0019_Image/[2020] SGMC 0019_image8.png)

278    It was the Prosecution’s case that the only direct evidence of the existence and details of the accused witnessing PW4 standing on the glass awning and cleaning the glass awning stem from PW4 and the accused. It was submitted that the PW4 had fully implicated the accused and as PW4 was a witness of truth her testimony should be believed and accorded full weight by the Court.

279    In essence, the Prosecution had urged the Court to accept PW4’s testimony as PW4 had no motive to lie, her testimony bears the ‘ring of truth’ and her account was inherently credible and internally consistent. It was submitted that the accused was a dishonest witness whose testimony should be disbelieved and accorded little weight by the Court. It was also the Prosecution’s case that DW2 and DW3’s evidence should not be believed as they had every reason to protect the accused.

280    According to the Prosecution, closer scrutiny of the sequence of events revealed it to be even less probable that PW4 falsely implicated the accused as part of an elaborate plan just to facilitate a job transfer. Although PW4 testified that she was afraid that she might not be able to cope with the increased workload after ‘Kay’ left and had asked the accused for a transfer, after the accused’s assurance that she would be employing another domestic helper and the chores could be shared, PW4 decided to stay on with the accused when PW3 started working for the accused.

281    It was submitted that PW3 had testified that PW4 did not engineer the whole incident of standing on the glass awning and trying to pose for a picture. It was further submitted PW2 had testified during cross examination that she did not think it was possible for PW4 to pose for her to take a picture so that she could get a transfer. It was the Prosecution’s case that it was patently ludicrous to argue that PW4 would do something so dangerous to stand and clean the glass awning above the patio on a rainy day just so that her transfer to another employer could be facilitated by the MOM.

282    In contrast, it was the Defence’s case that the accused had not allowed PW4 to clean in such a manner. She did not have the requisite knowledge of such a practice as she had not seen PW4 cleaning in the manner described and was therefore not aware that PW4 cleaned the glass awning in such a manner. It was also the Defence’s case that no other Prosecution witness testified that the accused had witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning. It was submitted that the accused could only have witnessed PW4 cleaning the glass awning atop as alleged, it if she was at or very near the laundry area at the rear of the house.

283    It was the Defence’s case theory that this being her first job, PW4 had decided on her own to clean the glass awning by climbing atop it to facilitate a transfer. It was highlighted that PW4 had testified that the accused only told her that the glass awning must be cleaned. The step-by-step instructions were taught by Kay. It was submitted that despite allegedly being told by PW2 that this was dangerous, PW4 had continued doing so. By the time _Exhibit P13_ was captured, PW4 had long harboured thoughts of transferring her employment. It just so happened that PW2 witnessed PW4 atop the glass awning.

284    It was the Defence’s case that PW4 was not a credible witness and her evidence should be disbelieved. It was submitted that PW4’s recollection of key details of the four alleged occasions was patchy, her oral testimony contains several internal and external inconsistencies and her narrative did not cohere with the broader factual picture. According to the Defence, PW4’s evidence differed from the evidence of other Prosecution witnesses in several respects as set out in their submissions.

#### Standard of Proof

285    In my assessment of the evidence before me, I was mindful that only direct evidence of the accused witnessing PW4 cleaning in such a dangerous manner came from PW4. Hence, the _unsually convincing_ standard of proof for the Prosecution’s evidence would apply having regard to the totality of the evidence before me including the evidence in the Defence’s case[^25]. The evaluative task by the Court is thus not just internal to the Prosecution’s case, but also comparative in nature as the Court would have to consider the evidence in the Defence’s case. Essentially, the Prosecution had to prove that PW4’s evidence was both internally and externally consistent as well as inherently credible when considered against the totality of the evidence.

286    From PW4’s account, the occasions when she had cleaned the glass awning in such a manner was the period shortly before the accused had delivered her third child on 8 May 2017 and within the two months after her delivery and the accused had witnessed her doing so on two of these occasions. I was mindful that PW4 was unable to recall or provide specific details as to when these two occasions were. To prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the Prosecution had sought to solely rely on the evidence of PW4 that the accused had witnessed PW4 cleaning in such a dangerous manner on more than one occasion and yet had done nothing to stop PW4 from this dangerous practice of cleaning the glass awning from height.

287    In her defence to the amended charge, the accused had denied witnessing or allowing PW4 to clean the glass awning in such a manner. Her mother, DW2 who was present in the house between 6 May 2017 to 24 June 2017 to care for the accused and to assist her before her delivery and during her confinement period had denied seeing PW4 clean the glass awning by standing on it while she was staying at her daughter’s house. I noted that it was undisputed that during DW2’s almost two months’ stay in the house, she had cooked meals for the accused’s family and would have spent time in the kitchen. Hence, her evidence on the issue of fact as to whether the accused had allowed PW4 to clean the glass awning in such a manner was material and relevant to as she was present in the house during at least the material period.

288    As part of its case, the Prosecution had adduced and sought to rely on out of court assertions or statements allegedly made by Kay to PW2 and PW3 that the accused had instructed Kay to clean the glass awning in such a manner. It was clear that Kay’s direct evidence on the accused’s instructions on how the glass awning was to be cleaned was crucial to the Prosecution’s case and would have corroborated PW4’s account. Nevertheless, I disregarded these out of court assertions or statements as hearsay evidence as Kay was not present during the trial to attest to these facts. In my view, the Prosecution was clearly relying on the truth of the contents of Kay’s assertions or statements and not the fact that Kay had made them. Even so, I was not inclined to draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for its failure to produce Kay as a witness as I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made reasonable attempts to secure her attendance in Court but were unsuccessful.

289    In any event, although the initial charge preferred against the accused was that she had _instructed_ PW4 to clean the glass awning in such a manner on four different occasions between early June 2017 to 4 July 2017, the Prosecution’s position at trial was that she had _allowed_ PW4 to clean the glass awning in such a dangerous manner between early June 2017 to 4 July 2017 without specifying the number of occasions.

#### Absence of corrobotive evidence

290    In the present case, I was mindful that none of the Prosecution’s other witnesses had corroborated PW4’s testimony that the accused was present on any of the occasions when PW4 cleaned the glass awning by standing directly on the glass awning. I was also mindful that none of the accused’s other previous domestic workers who gave evidence during the trial had testified that they had cleaned the glass awning in a similar manner as PW4. In addition, I noted that the other foreign domestic workers who were witnesses at the trial had testified that PW4’s manner of cleaning the glass awning while standing directly on top was dangerous.

291    In my view, the Prosecution’s submissions that there was every possibility for the accused to have instructed Kay to clean the glass awning in the manner PW4 was seen cleaning after Evelyn left was speculative, particularly since PW3 who was employed subsequently was not instructed by the accused to clean the glass awning in such a manner. In any event, Kay was not available to give direct evidence that the accused had indeed given such instructions. Additionally, although PW3 was to learn from PW4 the steps on how to clean the glass awning, it was unchallenged that PW4 did not teach PW3 the same step-by-step instructions that she had allegedly received from Kay.

292    I was also of the view, the Prosecution’s reliance on PW3’s testimony that PW4 did not engineer the whole incident of standing on the glass awning and trying to pose for a picture as well as PW2’s testimony that she did not think it was possible for PW4 to pose for her to take a picture so that she could get a transfer were merely opinions or assumptions which in themselves did not amount to corroboration of the PW4’s evidence. In addition, I found that the Prosecution’s submission that if PW4 had wanted to falsely implicate the accused, she could have said that it was the accused who instructed her to clean the glass awning in the manner described was inconsistent with their own case theory at trial that the accused had allowed her to do so.

#### Internal and external inconsistencies in PW4’s evidence

293    It was the Prosecution’s case PW4’s account was inherently credible and internally consistent and that PW4’s evidence on her recount from day one of her employment until the day of the photo taking and meetings with MOM was logical, inherently credible and has a simple flow and sequence which the Prosecution submitted is the hallmark of the truth. It was submitted PW4’s testimony concerning the relevant sequence of events flows logically from one event to another and that her evidence was also externally corroborated in its material aspects by the other Prosecution witnesses.

294    In contrast, it was the Defence’s case that PW4 was unable to provide clear and consistent evidence as to key details of the four alleged occasions such as the dates and the witnesses who personally saw her on the glass awning. It was submitted that although she was able to recall clearly that the first three alleged occasions occurred before PW3 started work, yet she could not give a definite answer of whether the accused had already given birth on the second and third alleged occasions, choosing instead to remain evasive. It was highlighted by the Defence that instead of forthrightly admitting to her inability to recall, PW4 would change her position on the stand throughout the course of trial. In addition, it was further submitted that PW4’s oral testimony differs from her statement in _Exhibit P17_. In her further statement that was recorded on 19 June 2019, she was asked a claricatory question on the five times she had cleaned the glass ceiling. It was highlighted that PW4 had not corrected the recording officer who had asked her the question. It was the Defence’s case that PW4 had previously told the MOM that she had cleaned the glass awning five times and/or that PW4 in any event did not disagree with the premise that she had cleaned the glass awning five times.

295    It was further submitted that PW4’s evidence was externally inconsistent as well in that it differed from the evidence of other Prosecution witnesses in several respects. PW2 had gave evidence that prior to the fourth alleged occasion, she had seen PW4 once previously atop the glass awning, although she could not remember the date or month of such incident.

296    It was the Defence’s case that PW4’s evidence was contradicted in several respects by the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses, PW2 and PW3. PW4 had testified that it was PW2 who had first decided that a photograph should be taken of her atop the glass awning. This was contradicted by PW2 who testified that it was PW4 who had requested that her photograph be taken. PW3 who was present during the incident had also testified that it was PW4 who had requested that a photograph be taken.

297    It was submitted that PW2 had testified that prior to the day she had taken the photograph in _Exhibit P13_, she had seen PW4 cleaning the glass awning once before. She had asked PW4 if the accused had instructed her to clean and had no other conversations with PW4. In contrast, PW4 had testified that PW2 had seen her on the glass awning once before _Exhibit P13_ was taken and that PW2 had told her that PW4 was not the only who did that before and that there were many others. When this inconsistency was brought to PW4’s attention, she stuck to her story and insisted that PW2 was lying.

298    When dealing with the issue of such discrepancies in the testimony of a witness, the Court should first examine and determine if the discrepancies are actually material. Even if they were, it does not automatically mean that that the witness’s evidence should be disregarded in its entirety. Hence, in the present case, I would have to determine whether the discrepancies were material and to weigh these discrepancies against the totality of the evidence before determining whether to accept or reject PW4’s evidence on the key facts in issue.

299    In the present case, after a careful examination of the evidence before me, I was unable to accept the Prosecution’s case that PW4’s account was both internally and externally consistent. In the present case, I found that the internal and external discrepancies in PW4’s evidence were material and when compared against the totality of the evidence, I was unable to accept PW4’s evidence on the key fact in issue. In my view, this was weakness in the Prosecution’s own evidence that irrevocably lowers it below the threshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

300    Hence, based on the totality of the evidence before me, I did not find the evidence of PW4 unusually convincing such that it was capable of discharging the Prosecution's case in view of the internal and external inconsistencies in her account. Moreover, I was of the view that it was insufficient for the Prosecution to insinuate that the accused had the opportunity to witness PW4 cleaning the glass awning as they were both living in the same house and she would have gone to the kitchen area for her meals at the material time. Based on the evidence before me, I found that the accused could only have witnessed PW4 cleaning the glass awning in such a manner only if she was at the entrance from the kitchen to the laundry area or if she was at or very near the laundry area at the rear of the house. Consequently, I found that the Prosecution had failed to prove the second element of the amended charge that the accused had allowed PW4 to climb onto the glass awning and clean it while standing on top of it, thereby endangering PW4’s safety and contravening section 22(1)(a) the EFMA.

## Conclusion

301    After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I was not satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established all the essential elements of the charge in the present case. Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution has failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt all the essential elements of the amended charge in _MAC-904378-2018_ and the accused was given a Discharge Amounting to Acquittal on the said charge.
