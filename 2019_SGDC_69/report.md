Contract – Employment – Commission – Terms – Interpretation

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 12/2019.\]

10 April 2019

### District Judge Lim Wee Ming:

The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant who was his employer, is for the sum of S$118,152.50 for commissions and other sums under his employment contract. The Defendant has a counterclaim against the Plaintiff for the return of 6 months’ salary paid to the Plaintiff amounting to $57,000. I entered judgment against the Defendant for the full amount of the Plaintiff’s claim and dismissed the Defendant’s counterclaim. The Defendant has appealed against my decision.

## Facts

2       The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is for the sum of S$118,152.20 for commissions and other sums claimed by the Plaintiff under a Letter of Appointment dated 22 August 2011 “(the Letter of Appointment”) between the Plaintiff and Defendant. The Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant as its Vice-President of Business Development and commenced employment with the Defendant in September 2011. Prior to this, the Plaintiff was employed as the General Manager of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Asia Private Limited (“Hitachi”).

3       The Letter of Appointment provides for the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff commissions based on the quarterly gross profits achieved. Annex A of the Letter of Appointment \[Agreed Bundle (“AB”) at page 19\], provides for the commissions payable based on various achievement levels. The relevant achievement levels are as follows:

4       Annex A further provides that “_CQ3’ 2011 short fall can be carried forward to CQ4’ 2011. As long as you have achieved the average quarterly GP target for each respective level for CQ3 & CQ4 2011. Commission for that level of achievement will still be paid to you.”_

5       The Plaintiff left the Defendant’s employment in March 2012, after he was asked by the Defendant to resign. The Defendant claims that the Plaintiff had underperformed, whereas the Plaintiff’s position is that he had more than achieved the gross profit targets set out in the Letter of Appointment and as a result, the targets were increased for the next year \[see paragraphs 12 to 15 of the affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) of the Plaintiff\].

6       The Plaintiff’s position is that the quarterly gross profits achieved for the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2011 are as follows:

a.     3rd quarter of 2011: $765,985.

b.     4th quarter of 2011: $1,312,140.

7       After adjusting for the shortfall in the gross profits for the 3rd quarter of 2011, the Plaintiff claimed that the gross profit figures to be used for the computation of his commissions are as follows:

a.     3rd quarter of 2011: $800,000.

b.     4th quarter of 2011: $1,278,125 (based on $1,312,140 less shortfall of $34,015 in the 3rd quarter).

8       From the aforesaid gross profit figures, the Plaintiff claimed the following commissions:

a.     3rd quarter of 2011: 2% of $800,000 = $16,000.

b.     4th quarter of 2011: 5% of $1,278,125 = 63,906.25.

9       The Plaintiff also claimed a take-on fee of 2 months’ salary amounting to $19,000, for achieving an average of $800,000 per quarter for the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2011 as provided for in clause 5 of the Letter of Appointment (AB17).

10     The Defendant disputes the Plaintiff’s claims for commissions. The Defendant’s position is that:

a.     There was an Exclusion Agreement between the parties that the Plaintiff would not be involved in the Defendant’s promotion and distribution of the Defendant’s Hitachi portfolio (“the Hitachi Portfolio”) and the gross profits received by the Defendant from the Hitachi Portfolio would not be taken into account when computing the total quarterly gross profits attributable to the Plaintiff \[see Bundle of Pleadings (“BP”) at page 65\]. The Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff belatedly disclosed on the first day of his employment with the Defendant, that he did not want to be involved in the Hitachi Portfolio because he was not on good terms with Hitachi’s management, and the parties then agreed on the oral Exclusion Agreement.

b.     Under the Letter of Appointment, the Commission would only be payable to the Plaintiff for sales achieved by the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work (BP61). The Defendant’s position is that the exponential profits earned by the Defendant had nothing to do with the personal efforts of the Plaintiff, as they arose from a flood in Thailand causing hard disk drive component suppliers to suffer loss of equipment and raw materials leading to a shortage of hard disk drives, which enabled the Defendant to increase its sale price of hard disk drives (BP66).

c.     The quantum of gross profits is below that claimed by the Plaintiff (BP66-67).

11     The Plaintiff also claims 8 days’ salary in March 2012 in the sum of $3,454.60, annual leave of 6 days in the sum of $2,590.90 and one month’s salary in lieu of notice amounting to $9,500. The Defendant had given two cheques to the Plaintiff for the payment of these sums, as well as the sum of $16,000 which the Defendant claimed was for a “One-Off team bonus” (AB108-110). However, the cheques were returned by the Plaintiff, after he disputed the sums that the Defendant wished to pay him and made his claims against the Defendant for commissions and the take-on fee.

12     The Defendant counterclaims $57,000 against the Plaintiff, being the Plaintiff’s salary for the 6 months that he was employed by the Defendant. This claim was not made in the original Defence filed by the Defendant on 15 February 2013 (BP7-15). It was only raised by the Defendant when they amended their Defence to include a Counterclaim on 28 April 2017 (BP20-43), more than 4 years after the original Defence was filed.

13     At the trial, the Plaintiff was his only witness. The Defendant’s three witnesses were the Defendant’s Chief Executive Officer, Jason Tan, the Defendant’s Chief Finance Officer, Mei Loh and the Defendant’s Sales Director, Woo Chee Keong. Jason Tan and Mei Loh are husband and wife.

## Decision

14     I will first deal with the Plaintiff’s claims for the commissions and take-on fee, followed by his claims for the one month’s salary in lieu of notice and other items.

## Commission and take-on fee

15     In deciding the Plaintiff’s claims for the commission and take-on fee, I had to consider the following issues:

a.     Whether there was an Exclusion Agreement as alleged by the Defendant.

b.     The interpretation of the commission agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.

c.     The quantum of the gross profits and consequentially, the commission payable to the Plaintiff.

##### The purported oral Exclusion Agreement

16     The Plaintiff disputes the purported oral Exclusion Agreement and belated disclosure. I find that there was no such Exclusion Agreement or belated disclosure for the following reasons:

a.     There is no email or documentation between the parties evidencing any such Exclusion Agreement. The Defendant claims that it was shocked by the Plaintiff’s disclosure that he did not want to be involved with the Hitachi Portfolio, yet there was no email or any other documentation from the Defendant to the Plaintiff recording the purported Exclusion Agreement or the Defendant’s purported unhappiness over the alleged disclosure.

b.     When the Plaintiff disputed the commission payable, the Defendant never referred to such an Exclusion Agreement in their letter to the Plaintiff dated 2 April 2014 (AB111). The focus of that letter was that the 4th quarter gross profit was the result of the flood in Thailand and there was no mention of any agreement that the gross profits from the Hitachi Portfolio would not be taken into account.

c.     In a further letter dated 15 May 2012 from the Defendant to the Plaintiff disputing the Plaintiff’s claims for commission (AB114-115), the Defendant raised the Thai flood and claimed that the Plaintiff underperformed, but again made no mention that the Hitachi Portfolio should be excluded, even though the letter refers to a list of 10 items to be considered for deduction from the gross profit figures (AB115). Although item 3 in this list makes a general reference to “_Product that is not handle by you_”, it is astonishing that there is no express reference to the Hitachi Portfolio, in view of the Hitachi Portfolio forming a large proportion of the gross profit figures and the Defendant’s allegation that they “_were extremely surprised and shocked by \[the Plaintiff’s\] Belated Disclosure_” relating to the Hitachi Portfolio (see paragraph 40 of Jason Tan’s AEIC).

d.     In a letter dated 16 July 2012 from the Defendant (AB120), in response to a letter of demand from the Plaintiff’s solicitors, the Defendant disputed the Plaintiff’s claims and claimed that the Plaintiff underperformed, but again made no mention of the Hitachi Portfolio being excluded.

e.     In a further letter dated 1 August 2012 from the Defendant to the Plaintiff’s solicitors (AB124), the Defendant again claimed that the Plaintiff was terminated due to under achievement, but made no mention that the Hitachi Portfolio should be excluded in the computation. The Defendant’s letter further raises the need to “_differentiate & eliminate_” various items from the gross profits, such as marketing fund and stock returns, but again makes no mention that the Hitachi Portfolio should be excluded.

17     It is remarkable that in repeated letters from the Defendant to the Plaintiff or his solicitors, such a fundamental change in the agreement to exclude the Hitachi Portfolio was not mentioned at all in any of these letters. In the premises, I reject the Defendant’s defence that there was such an Exclusion Agreement.

##### The interpretation of the commission agreement

18     In relation to the Defendant’s argument that the commission would only be payable to the Plaintiff for sales achieved by the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work, I am unable to accept this argument, as this is not provided for in the Letter of Appointment. The Plaintiff was the Vice-President of Business Development and worked with a sales team. How would one measure the extent to which the gross profits were achieved by the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work, rather than the efforts of the sales team or external factors such as the Thai flood or improvements in the economy? In submitting that commissions should be based on the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work, it would appear that the Defendant is seeking to interpret the provision for a commission as a provision for a discretionary bonus instead. The agreement between the parties is an agreement for a commission if certain targets were achieved, rather than an agreement for a discretionary bonus where the employer has full discretion to decide on the bonus to be paid to the employee.

19     I am of the view that there is nothing in the provision for a commission in the Letter of Appointment to suggest that it is dependent on how the Defendant perceives that the gross profit targets were attained through the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work. It would have been easy to include a proviso that any commission payable would be dependent on the effort put in by the Plaintiff to achieve the gross profits, but there is no such proviso in the Letter of Appointment. In the premises, I find no reason to read into the Letter of Appointment, the additional words required to support the interpretation sought by the Defendant.

20     I would further point out that the Defendant’s position that the gross profits must be achieved through the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work (BP61) is not consistent with the targets in Annex A for the 3rd quarter of 2011 and the 4th quarter of 2011 being the same, even though the Plaintiff only joined the Defendant in September 2011 (AB16), the last month of the 3rd quarter of 2011. It would be impossible for any of the gross profits in July and August 2011, which are the first two months of the 3rd quarter, to have been achieved through the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work. Although there is a provision that shortfall in the 3rd quarter of 2011 “_can be carried forward_” to the 4th quarter of 2011, as long as the Plaintiff “_achieved the average quarterly \[gross profit\] target_”, it is hard to believe that it was the parties’ intention that this proviso was intended to set-off all the gross profits for July and August 2011, when the Plaintiff was not even working for the Defendant. If the parties intended that the gross profits must be achieved through the Plaintiff’s own personal efforts and work, then the gross profit targets for the Plaintiff for the 3rd quarter of 2011, would only be for the month of September 2011 after the Plaintiff joined the Defendant, and it would not have covered the entire quarter including July and August 2011.

21     Furthermore, based on the Defendant’s interpretation of the commission agreement, none of the gross profits achieved for the two months of July and August 2011 should be taken into consideration since the Plaintiff was not even working for the Defendant in those two months. The Defendant has not taken this position to exclude July and August 2011 in their computation of gross profits for the 3rd quarter of 2011 \[see paragraph 67(i) of Jason Tan’s AEIC\]. In the premises, I find that the Defendant’s own computation of the gross profits for the 3rd quarter of 2011, is inconsistent with the Defendant’s interpretation of the commission agreement.

22     The Defendant has sought to rely on the Court of Appeal decision of _Goh Lay Khim v Isabel Redrup Agency Pte Ltd_ , in support of his submission that in the absence of a contractual term governing the right to receive a commission, the court would imply an “_effective cause_” term to determine when the commission earner would have earned the right to claim for such commission. However, the table in Annex A expressly sets out the commission to be earned if various targets are achieved. Accordingly, I am of the view that the Defendant’s reliance on _Goh Lay Khim_ is misconceived, as there is an express contractual term governing the right to receive a commission, unlike _Goh Lay Khim_, where such a term was absent.

##### Quantum of gross profits and commission payable

23     The Defendant has also disputed the gross profit claimed by the Plaintiff. The gross profit claimed by the Plaintiff is based on information which he had obtained when he was still in the employment of the Defendant. The Defendant’s Chief Finance Officer, Mei Loh, had written to the Plaintiff asking for the Plaintiff’s submission of the gross profit report and the Plaintiff had replied with his computation based on gross profit figures given by his team (AB102-104). There was no reply from Mei Loh disputing these figures. In fact, Mei Loh acknowledged in cross-examination that the gross profit for the 3rd quarter of 2011 was $765,985 and for the 4th quarter of 2011 was $1,312,140 (see NE of 14 November at pages 121-122), which are the gross profits claimed by the Plaintiff.

24     The Defendant has submitted that the gross profit achieved by the Plaintiff for the 3rd quarter of 2011 was only $43,966.76 and that there was a shortfall of $756,033.24 from the target of $800,000 \[see paragraph 72(i) of the Defendant’s Closing Submissions\]. The Defendant has further submitted that the gross profit achieved by the Plaintiff for the 4th quarter of 2011 was only $71,184.26 and that there was a shortfall of $728,815.74 from the target of $800,000 \[see paragraph 72(ii) of the Defendant’s Closing Submissions\]. If the Defendant is to be believed, this would mean that the Plaintiff achieved less than 10% of his target. If that is the case, it would make little sense for the Defendant to give the Plaintiff a bonus of $16,000 and state its appreciation to the Plaintiff for his efforts in the Defendant’s letter to the Plaintiff of 28 March 2012 (AB108). The bonus of $16,000 paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff was 4 times more than the $4,000 bonus paid by the Defendant to its sales director, Woo Chee Kong (AB107). The Defendant now claims that this payment to the Plaintiff was merely out of goodwill (see paragraph 93 of Jason Tan’s AEIC), but I find it hard to believe that there would be such goodwill, if the shortfall in meeting targets was more than 90%, as alleged by the Defendant.

25     In the aforesaid letter of 28 March 2012, the Defendant also referred to “_100% achievement of the set quota for Q4_”. In the Defendant’s next letter dated 2 April 2012, the Defendant again referred to the Plaintiff’s “_100% achievement of the set quota for \[Q4 gross profits\]_” (AB111). The Defendant’s current position that there was a shortfall of more than 90% for the gross profits in the 4th quarter, is entirely inconsistent with the Defendant’s aforesaid letters referring to 100% achievement for the 4th quarter.

26     Furthermore, the gross profit figures currently relied upon by the Defendant are vastly different from those in paragraph 13 of the Defendant’s original Defence filed on 15 February 2013 (BP13), wherein the Defendant claimed that the 3rd quarter 2011 gross profits achieved by the Plaintiff was $70,145.56 and 4th quarter 2011 gross profits achieved by the Plaintiff was $730,569.16. The Defendant only amended their Defence on 28 April 2017, more than 4 years later, to revise the gross profit figures to those set out in paragraph 24 above (see BP31, 32, 66 and 67). No good reason has been given for this drastic change in position. In the premises, I am unable to accept the Defendant’s evidence on the gross profits achieved by the Plaintiff.

27     In the light of the above, I find the Plaintiff’s evidence on the gross profits achieved more credible. In the premises, the commissions claimed by the Plaintiff are allowed.

28     Consequentially, the $19,000 take-on fee, which is payable to the Plaintiff for achieving an average of $800,000 gross profits for the 3rd and 4th quarter, is also allowed.

## Plaintiff’s claims for one month’s salary in lieu of notice and other items

29     As for the Plaintiff’s claims for 8 days’ salary, 6 days’ annual leave and one month’s salary in lieu of notice, these were sums which the Defendant had under the cover of their letter dated 28 March 2012 to the Plaintiff (AB108-110), issued two cheques in favour of the Plaintiff. Jason Tan has alleged that the Defendant was prepared to pay these sums out of goodwill (see paragraph 93 of his AEIC), but there is nothing in the aforesaid letter to support that allegation, nor the Defendant’s allegation that the Plaintiff was still on probation. In fact, the letter expressly states that the payment was being made “_according to the letter of appointment_”, rather than any goodwill from the Defendant.

30     The Defendant produced confirmation of appointment letters for three other employees, to support their argument that the Plaintiff was still on probation, as such a letter was not issued to the Plaintiff (see paragraph 89 of Jason Tan’s AEIC). None of these three employees were called to give evidence. Other than the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Finance Officer, the only employee of the Defendant who gave evidence was the Defendant’s Sales Director, Woo Chee Keong. There was no evidence from Woo Chee Keong that he received such a confirmation letter. The absence of such a confirmation letter to the Plaintiff is neither here nor there, as the Plaintiff’s probation period under the Letter of Appointment was to have ended in December 2011 and there was no letter from the Defendant to inform the Plaintiff that his probation was being extended.

31     I am of the view that the fact that the Defendant issued cheques for the payment of the 8 days’ salary, 6 days’ annual leave and one month’s salary in lieu of notice to the Plaintiff under the aforesaid letter of 28 March 2012, without any qualification, is more compelling. Furthermore, the subsequent letters from the Defendant to the Plaintiff dated 2 April 2012 (AB111) and 15 May 2012 (AB114-115), also did not make any claim that the Plaintiff was still on probation. In the letter of 15 May 2012, the Defendant even tells the Plaintiff to return the bonus of $16,000 as the Plaintiff was claiming a larger sum in commissions, but makes no mention about the 8 days’ salary, 6 days’ annual leave and one month’s salary in lieu of notice. It was only in the Defendant’s letter of 1 August 2012 (AB124-125), more than 4 months after the Plaintiff left the employment of the Defendant, that the Defendant first made its claim that the Plaintiff was still under probation. I am of the view that this belated allegation by the Defendant was an afterthought and I did not believe this allegation.

32     In the premises, I am not inclined to accept Jason Tan’s claim that the Defendant was prepared to make this payment out of goodwill. Accordingly, the Plaintiff’s claims for 8 days’ salary, 6 days’ annual leave and one month’s salary in lieu of notice are allowed as well.

## Defendant’s counterclaim

33     As for the Defendant’s counterclaim for the salary from 5 September 2011 to 12 March 2012 amounting to $57,000 which it paid to the Plaintiff, there is no basis for this claim. The Defendant alleges that the Plaintiff failed to perform his employment responsibilities, talked with property agents during office hours, failed to meet his quota and failed to provide any valuable consideration for his salary \[see paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amendment No. 2) dated 5 September 2018\]. Essentially, the Defendant’s position is that the Plaintiff did no work at all for the 6 months that he was employed by the Defendant.

34     I find this stand taken by the Defendant incredible, as the Defendant had paid the Plaintiff his salary for 6 months and after his resignation, had given him cheques for one month’s salary in lieu of notice, as well as $16,000 for what was described by the Defendant as a one-off team bonus (AB108-110). The Plaintiff was appointed by the Defendant as its Vice-President of Business Development reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer, Jason Tan (see Letter of Appointment at AB16, 17). If the Plaintiff did nothing at all for 6 months, one would have expected Jason Tan to have terminated the Plaintiff much earlier, rather than allow him to collect his salary for 6 months doing nothing.

35     I further note that the Defendant’s counterclaim was only raised more than 4 years after the original Defence was filed (see paragraph 12 above). As I have previously observed (see paragraph 26 above), in the original Defence, the Defendant claimed that the Plaintiff had achieved $730,569.16 in gross profits in the 4th quarter of 2011 and it was only more than 4 years later, that the Defendant revised this figure down to $71,184.26. In the premises, I am unable to accept the Defendant’s position that the Plaintiff did no work for 6 months.

36     Accordingly, the Defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed.

## Conclusion

37     In conclusion, I accept the Plaintiff’s claims in full and dismiss the Defendant’s counterclaim. Judgment is entered for the Plaintiff’s claims in the sum of S$118,152.50, together with interest and costs.
