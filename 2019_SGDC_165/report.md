Sale Of Goods – Tort- Others (Conversion; Conspiracy)

13 August 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

## DCA 18/2019

This Suit arose as a result of a dispute over a car.

2       This case was unusual because the two main persons involved in this dispute were not even parties to the Suit, although they played material roles. One of these persons was not even called as a witness.

3       The Plaintiff, Goh Phei Chi (Wu Peiqi) (“Goh”) was previously married to Cao Shengliang (“Mike”). Goh and Mike were divorced in or about June 2016. Mike was made a bankrupt in September 2016. Mike was an undischarged bankrupt at all material times thereafter.

4       The 1st Defendant, Veronica Teo Shiyun (“Teo”) is married to Lim Zhi Chong Terence (“Terence”).

5       Neither Mike nor Terence were parties to this Suit. Mike gave evidence on behalf of Goh during the trial. Terence was originally an intended witness for Teo. An Affidavit of Terence’s evidence in chief had been filed. However, Teo did not call Terence as a witness at trial. The other parties also did not call Terence as a witness.

6       The 2nd Defendant, Sea Kwan San (“Frankie”), was at all material times, the general manager in Carway Enterprise (“Carway”). The 3rd Defendant, Lim Ngeng Ku, was at all material times, the sole proprietor of Carway. Carway was in the business of selling and buying pre-owned cars. The 3rd Defendant did not play an active part at the trial as the events materially involved Frankie as the general manager of Carway. The 3rd Defendant aligned her case to that of Frankie’s.

7       The evidence revealed that this dispute revolved mainly and primarily around Mike and Terence. From Goh’s pleaded claim, it is reasonably clear why Mike was not a co-Plaintiff. In any event, as stated earlier, Mike was an undischarged bankrupt for the most part during the time frame of the dispute.

8       Goh had chosen not to sue Terence on a possible alternative cause of action. As Terence was not a party to this Suit, there would not be a need to consider whether Goh had a reasonable cause of action against Terence.

9       After considering all the evidence and the very helpful written closing submissions from all Counsel, I found that Goh had not proven her case against Teo on the one part, and as against Frankie and the 3rd Defendant on the other part, on a balance of probabilities. I therefore dismissed Goh’s claims against all 3 Defendants, with costs.

10     The main plank of Goh’s claims against the Defendants was that Mike was acting as her agent at all material times. Goh also claimed that Terence had been acting as Teo’s agent at all material times. The dispute revolved around a car bearing registration SKA 64E (the “Car”) which had previously been registered in Teo’s sole name. The Car, at all material times, was under financing.

11     Goh’s claims against Teo were under the causes of action in contract, unjust enrichment and (together with the 2nd and 3rd Defendants) “unlawful means conspiracy”. The following constituted Goh’s claim against Teo.

12     Goh stated that in or around December 2015, Teo, “through Terence” had allowed her (Goh), “through Mike” to have the “exclusive right to possess and use” the Car (provided the monthly repayment instalments to the financiers, Kenso Leasing Pte Ltd {“Kenso”} were made).

13     Goh further goes on to state that in or around December 2016, that she (Goh) “agreed to purchase” and Teo “agreed to sell” the Car on the terms as pleaded. These terms were that the purchase price of the Car was to include the sums already paid by Goh to Teo for Kenso as per the previous agreement, that Goh would pay an additional sum of $40,000 to Teo, that Goh would continue to pay the monthly repayment instalments to Teo until the sums due to Kenso were fully paid up, that the sum due to Kenso at that time “was in the region of S$40,000” and that Teo would transfer the “legal title” to the Car to Goh once the instalments due to Kenso were fully paid up.

14     Goh asserted that this alleged contract was “concluded orally” between Mike and Terence as agents of Goh and Teo respectively. Goh pleaded that after the conclusion of the alleged contract, she “began treating the Car as her own”, and that as a result, the “beneficial ownership” of the Car vested in her “as of the date of the Contract”, or in the alternative, in or around February 2017 “when the final instalment due to Kenso Leasing was fully paid off”.

15     The evidence indicated that since around December 2015, when the first arrangement had been made between Mike and Terence concerning the use of the Car, Mike had been almost exclusively driving the Car. The evidence further suggested that the arrangement that Mike and Terence had agreed to in December 2015 had led to a quasi-rental situation, with Mike “renting” the Car from Terence.

16     In February 2017, Teo contracted with Carway (through Frankie) to sell the Car to Carway. As the Car was not then in the possession of either Terence or Teo, Carway could not take immediate possession of the Car. The Car was eventually caused to be towed away by Carway through the actions of Frankie on 4 June 2017. As of that date, Mike was still using the Car. In July 2017, the Car was transferred to Carway. Carway had paid up the outstanding loan on the Car (Teo had previously re-financed the Car and Kenso had been paid the balance due. Carway paid the entity that had re-financed the Car).

17     Goh claimed that Teo had been “unjustly enriched” in respect of monthly payments Goh claimed had been paid to Teo for the Car during the period March to June 2017. Goh further claimed that Teo had purported to pledge the Car to Frankie to secure a loan provided by Frankie to Terence. Goh had an alternative claim in unjust enrichment against Teo for the sums allegedly paid to Teo earlier.

18     As against Frankie and Carway, Goh claimed against them in conversion, reciting the events surrounding the towing away of the Car and the subsequent offer of the Car for sale by Carway.

19     As against all 3 Defendants, Goh had a further claim against all 3 of them in “unlawful means conspiracy”, alleging that the events surrounding the towing away of the Car led to “the irresistible inference” that Teo had “unlawfully conspired with” Frankie and Carway to “cause the loss of the Car”.

20     Goh had several methods of calculating the loss she said she had suffered as a result of the various alleged breaches of contract of Teo and the various actions of Teo, Frankie and Carway. Upon a careful consideration of all the evidence, I found, as aforesaid, that Goh had failed to prove her case against any of the Defendants on any of the several heads of claim as set out. Goh’s claims against all 3 Defendants were therefore dismissed with costs.

21     Teo’s position in the matter was quite straightforward. As far as Goh’s assertion that Mike had been acting as Goh’s agent, Teo pleaded that she had no knowledge of this. Crucially, on Goh’s assertion that Terence had been acting as Teo’s agent, Teo denied this allegation. Teo averred that Terence “was not authorised to act as her agent at any time”. After an earlier accident involving the Car (an event that preceded the material events), Teo had allowed Terence to have possession of the Car “for his own use only”.

22     The evidence showed that Mike and Terence had shared a friendship for several years. It is therefore not surprising that they could and did enter into “loose” arrangements surrounding the use of the Car. I use the word “loose” not to indicate that there would not have been any binding obligations between the 2 persons (Mike and Terence), but that would depend on the legal interpretation to be given to “agreements” ostensibly made between the two of them. The point to this is that the evidence strongly indicated that the arrangements surrounding the use of the Car were arrived at exclusively between Mike and Terence. The extent of the involvement of Goh and Teo in these discussions and “agreements” between the 2 men was rather limited, at best.

23     The actual involvement of Goh and Teo was rather peripheral. If at all, the evidence indicated that any disputes appeared to centre around what exactly were the terms of agreement (assuming there were binding agreements between the 2 men). As emphasised earlier, Mike and Terence were both not parties to this Suit. Due to his bankrupt status, there were many actions Mike could not legally or lawfully partake of. As Mike and Terence were not parties to this action, we could not analyse their respective positions and obligations in the events that played out.

24     As for Goh’s claims against Teo, she had pleaded her cause of action primarily based on agency principles. And this is where Goh’s claim against Teo would fundamentally fail. There was no documentary evidence of the alleged agreements Goh was relying on. The evidence was that the various arrangements relating to the use of the Car were arrived at exclusively by, and between Mike and Terence. Terence was not a party to the action and was not called as a witness. It was open to Goh to have called Terence as a witness when it became apparent that Teo was not calling Terence as a witness. She did not.

25     It was the common stand of the Defendants (Teo on the one hand, and Frankie and Carway on the other) that the evidence simply could not sustain a finding that Terence was acting as Teo’s agent in the sale of the Car to Goh (or for that matter, to Mike).

26     It was Teo’s unshaken evidence that she had not at any time authorised Terence to be her agent in a sale of the Car to Goh. On this point, I was in agreement with the combined stand taken by the Defendants that Goh had failed to show that Terence had either the actual authority or the apparent authority to act as agent in the sale of the Car to Goh. It had never been represented by Teo to either Goh or Mike that she (Teo) was arming Terence with the authority to act as her agent in a purported sale of the Car to Goh. What Mike believed Terence was obliged to do was not an issue that the Court had to deal with, as Mike and Terence were not parties to the action.

27     As far as Teo was concerned, Goh could not show that Teo had made any indication or representation to Goh or Mike that she (Teo) had authorised Terence to act on her (Teo) behalf as Teo’s agent. The arrangements had been made between Mike and Terence.

28     Hence, as far as the legal position between Teo and Goh was concerned, there was no impediment to Teo entering into a valid agreement for the sale of the Car to Carway, as there was no contractual nexus between Teo and Goh concerning the ownership of the Car. Goh had failed to show that there was a binding contract entered into between herself and Teo.

29     As far as Goh’s claims against Frankie and Carway were concerned, these would also fail. Pursuant to my finding that there had been no contractual nexus between Goh and Teo, there was no legal impediment to Teo’s entering into a contract for the sale of the Car to Carway. At best, Frankie may have known that Mike was using the Car. But that would not have been a barrier to Carway entering into a valid agreement to directly purchase the Car from Teo, as Carway’s intention was to remove any “encumbrance” by paying off the outstanding due to the then financier, and obtaining the direct agreement for the transfer of the Car from the registered owner (Teo).

30     In the events that had unfolded, there was suggestion that if at all there had been any cause of complaint with the actions of Frankie in the towing away of the Car, it would appear to have been Mike rather than Goh who might possibly be in such a position. However, Mike was not asserting a personal right of any kind regarding the Car in this Suit or any other Suit, it would appear. Therefore, this was not an issue to be grappled with, here. The evidence simply could not sustain any assertion that Frankie and Carway had converted the Car contrary to the interests of Goh, as Goh had no enforceable interest in the Car as against the then registered owner, Teo, to begin with. I also found that Goh’s claim against Teo for unjust enrichment could not succeed. The evidence of various payments allegedly made by Goh was not satisfactory. We could not come to a firm finding, on a balance of probabilities, that the alleged payments had indeed been made by Goh to Teo. In any event, some of these alleged payments could have been characterised as consideration for the period of Mike’s rental use of the Car. Overall, the evidence did not support Goh’s claim under this head.

31     The evidence also clearly showed that there could not have been any “unlawful means conspiracy” involving the 3 Defendants in a concerted plan to cause loss to Goh. As parties conducted themselves, the 3 Defendants had been legally entitled to act as they did, vis-a-vis Goh, as there had been no enforceable contractual obligations created as between Goh and Teo.

32     As the main players, Mike and Terence, were not parties to this action, we could not come to any definitive findings concerning their respective legal positions in this matter. But as far as Goh was concerned, her claims against the 3 Defendants failed, under each of the heads of claim cited. Goh’s claims against all 3 Defendants were therefore dismissed with costs.
