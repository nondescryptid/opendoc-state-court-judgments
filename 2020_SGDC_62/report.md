\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9047/2020/01.\]

17 March 2020

### District Judge Kaur Jasvender:

1       The accused pleaded guilty to two charges of robbery under s 392 Penal Code (Cap 224) and one charge of criminal misappropriation under s 403 Penal Code. Two charges of robbery under s 392 Penal Code were taken into consideration with the consent of the accused for the purpose of sentence. The robbery charges involved voluntarily causing hurt to four victims in order for the accused to commit theft, by administering a stupefying drug, Midazolam, which caused them to suffer bodily infirmity, i.e. resulting in them becoming unconscious.

2       He was sentenced to 12 years preventive detention (‘PD’). He has now brought this appeal against that sentence.

## Summary of Facts

3       The accused was arrested on 24 October 2018 at about 7.45 pm, at Sultan Plaza. He was found in possession of one blister pack containing six pink oblong tablets.

4       On 31 October 2018, the six tablets were submitted to the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (‘HSA’) for analysis. On 21 November 2018, Widodo Andreas, an analyst, issued a report bearing Lab No. TX-1831-06763 stating that two tablets were taken for analysis and Midazolam was detected in them.

5       On 9 May 2019, he issued a report stating that Midazolam “is a sleep-inducing agent used to treat insomnia and to relieve anxiety before surgery or certain procedures. It is given to cause drowsiness, relieve anxiety, and prevent any memory of the event” and that “Hydroxymidazolam is a metabolite of midazolam.”

#### Facts relating to DAC-935443-2018

6       The victim is one Xu Yamei, a female national of the People’s Republic of China. On 23 October 2018, sometime after 9.00 pm, the victim met the accused in the vicinity of Sophia Road. The accused invited her to come with him to Geylang, and the victim agreed.

7       Somewhere in Geylang, the accused bought a bottle of beer which he shared with the victim. After drinking the beer, the next thing that the victim knew was she was alone in a hotel room. She discovered some of her properties missing, namely, (a) one iPhone 8 Plus, (b) one iPhone 6 Plus, (c) one silver coloured chain, (d) cash amounting to S$60.

8       On 24 October 2018 at 1.39 am, the victim sought assistance from the police.

9       At about 7.45pm on the same day, the accused was arrested. The items (a) to (c) belonging to the victim were recovered from him.

10     On 24 October 2018, the victim’s blood and urine samples were sent to the HSA for analysis. On 21 November 2018, Widodo Andreas issued a report bearing Lab No. TX-1831-06602 which stated that the blood sample was analysed and found to contain less than 0.02 microgrammes of Midazolam per millilitre of blood. The urine sample was analysed and found to contain Midazolam and Hydroxymidazolam (a metabolite of Midazolam).

11     Investigations established that sometime between 9.00 pm on 23 October 2018 and 1.39 am on 24 October 2018, somewhere in Geylang, the accused, in order to commit theft, voluntarily caused hurt to the victim by administering a stupefying drug, Midazolam, which caused her to suffer bodily infirmity as she became unconscious. After the victim became unconscious, the accused committed theft of her property stated at \[7\]. Consistent with the effects of Midazolam, the victim was unable to recall the events.

#### Facts relating to DAC-937875-2018

12     The victim is Trinh Thi Thanh, a female national of Vietnam. On 17 October 2018 at about 6.00 am, the victim met the accused in a club in Orchard Towers. They left the location and headed to Balestier Hawker Centre together. They arrived at Balestier Hawker Centre at about 6.30 am. There, the accused bought two cans of beer and offered one to the victim. After drinking the beer, the victim felt dizzy.

13     The next thing that the victim knew, she was alone in a hotel room in Balestier where she discovered some of her properties missing, namely, (a) one iPhone 6 Plus, (b) one gold necklace, (c) one white gold ring, (d) cash amounting to S$920. Consistent with the effects of Midazolam, the victim was unable to recall the rest of the events.

14     On 17 October 2018 at about 12.57pm, the victim sought assistance from the police.

15     Item (b) was recovered from the accused when he was arrested at about 7.45 pm on 24 October 2018.

16     Investigations established that sometime between 6.30 am and 12.54 pm on 17 October 2018, somewhere in Balestier, the accused, in order to commit theft, voluntarily caused hurt to the victim by administering a stupefying drug, Midazolam, which caused her to suffer bodily infirmity by becoming unconscious. After the victim became unconscious, the accused committed theft of her property.

#### Facts relating to MAC-906211-2019

17     When the accused was arrested on 24 October 2018 at about 7.45 pm, at Sultan Plaza, he was found in possession of: (a) one Samsung phone of unknown value; (b) one yellow chain of unknown value; (c) one pair of earrings of unknown value; (d) one ring with white stone of unknown value; and (e) one ring with black stone of unknown value.

18     Investigations revealed that the items did not belong to the accused. The accused claimed that he found the items sometime in the morning of 24 October 2018 at Lorong 8 Geylang. He decided to dishonestly misappropriate them for his own use before he has used reasonable means to discover the owner.

## Antecedents

19     The accused has the following antecedents between 1981 and 2011.

## Mitigation

20     The accused in his written mitigation asked for a term of imprisonment. He said he is remorseful and will not appear in court again.

21     Learned counsel who assisted the accused under the Enhanced Guidance for Plea Scheme (‘EGPS’) suggested the minimum term of seven years PD. He said the accused who is currently 56 years old will be released when he is 63 years old. He stated the threat of reoffending that is envisaged at 70% will be much lower given the effluxion of time. It was said that the accused is very sorry and sincerely wants to put his anti-social behaviour behind him.

## Sentence

22     There is no dispute that the technical requirements for PD as set out in s 304(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, Rev Ed 2012) (“CPC”) are met. The accused is 56 years old (above 30). He has on at least three occasions been convicted of offences which carry an imprisonment term of two years or more and was on at least two of those occasions sentenced to an imprisonment term and a term of CT, and the current offences are punishable with an imprisonment term of two years or more. The pre-sentencing report states that the accused is of good physical condition and of normal mental condition and he is suitable to undergo PD.

23     The next step is to consider whether it is ‘expedient for the protection of the public’ that the accused should be detained in custody for a substantial period of time. The question is essentially whether the accused poses such a menace to society that it is expedient to keep him out of circulation for the protection of the public (see _Public Prosecutor v Wong Wing Hung_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 304</span>). The totality of his antecedents together with the present offending and the assessment of his anticipated future conduct in the pre-sentencing report are germane to this threshold test.

24     The following antecedents are relevant:

> I.     Conviction for administering a stupefying drug on 8 April 1993.

> II.     Conviction for theft on 16 May 1994.

> III.     Conviction for theft on 11 March 1999. The accused befriended a 26 year-old female from Uzbekistan in a discotheque and brought her to a hotel in Geylang, where the victim fell asleep after he had offered a can of stout to her. After she woke up, she found her personal items missing.

> IV.     Conviction for theft in dwelling on 16 December 2003. The accused befriended a 28-year old female from Philippines and they checked into a hotel. There, she fell asleep and when she woke up, her money and her Nokia handphone were missing.

> V.     Theft charge taken into consideration on 16 December 2003. The accused befriended a 27-year old Vietnamese female. She agreed to join the accused for drinks in a hotel room. She fell asleep in the hotel room and when she woke up, she found her cash and her other items missing.

> VI.     Conviction for theft on 3 March 2009. The accused befriended a 27-year old Vietnamese female at Lucky Plaza and they proceeded to a coffeeshop where the accused bought her a drink. After consuming the drink, the victim felt giddy and the accused offered to send her home in a taxi. When they alighted from the taxi, the accused had taken her handbag.

> VII.     Theft in dwelling charge taken into consideration on 3 March 2009. The accused and the victim checked into a room into a hotel in Geylang and the victim had fallen asleep thereafter. When she woke up, she found that her personal items were missing.

> VIII.     Theft in dwelling charge taken into consideration on 3 March 2009. The Accused befriended a 27-year Vietnamese female and offered her a drink. The victim lost consciousness after consuming the drink. When she woke up, she found herself in a hotel room and her handphone and cash were missing.

> IX.     Conviction for administering a stupefying drug on 3 June 2011. The accused had a chance meeting with the victim, a female Chinese national. He suggested to her to join him and his friends for drinks. The victim agreed. He brought her to a hotel where he claimed his friends were staying. He told her that his friends were not ready and suggested to go to the nearby McDonalds. There, he bought a cup of coffee for himself and the victim. He was convicted after a trial of administering a stupefying drug, namely, Midazolam, with the intent to facilitate the commission of an offence of theft in dwelling.

> X.     Conviction for theft in dwelling on 3 June 2011. The victim in this charge is the same victim. After she had consumed the coffee, she went out for a smoke with the accused. The victim did not know what happened thereafter. The accused brought the victim to a hotel in Geylang. He then committed theft of her cash of about $350, a Rolex watch valued at $3,600 and one Sony Ericsson handphone valued at $200.

25     The accused has since the 1990s been engaged in drugging and stealing from women. He had previously been charged under different offences, e.g. theft, theft in dwelling, causing hurt by means of poison. This is the first time he has been charged with robbery. The offences were clearly premeditated. As in the past offences, the accused deliberately targeted foreign women whom he befriended before eventually drugging and stealing from them. He had preyed on a total of seven victims in the convictions in 1999, 2003, 2009 and 2011. In the present case, there are a total of four victims. The accused was released in July 2016, and yet after 15 months he continued with the same modus operandi and committed more offences.

26     The pre-sentencing report states that the accused has no significant protective factors. His LS/CMI score places him in the high risk/needs level of criminal re-offending. He belongs to a group of prisoners with a 70.2% probability of recidivism within two years of release. As the accused ‘engaged in significant denial and minimisation of his offences’, the report states that the risk rating is likely to be an underestimation of his actual risk and should therefore be interpreted with caution.

27     Although the accused claimed that he was remorseful and wished to change, his conduct showed otherwise. The case had gone through the criminal case disclosure conference (‘CCDC’) process and four trial dates were allocated in April 2020. Thereafter, the accused indicated he wished to plead guilty. At the hearing on 18 December 2019, he pleaded guilty but denied committing the offences in his mitigation. His plea was therefore rejected. The case was fixed for a pre-trial conference (‘PTC’) for the prosecution to confirm the availability of the witnesses for the trial. At the PTC, the accused again indicated he wished to plead guilty. The case was then fixed on 21 January 2020, at which he pleaded guilty. However, in his interview with the psychologists at Prisons, he again denied the offences. On the return date on 11 February 2020, the accused insisted that he wished to maintain his plea of guilt. He also tendered a written mitigation stating “I’m fullest remorseful”. The case was then adjourned for a referral to the EGPS scheme for the accused to seek legal advice on his plea. At the resumed hearing, the accused confirmed that he had committed the offences.

28     Lengthy imprisonment terms and CT have proven ineffective. The accused’s offences show that he pose a threat to females whom he placed in a vulnerable state by drugging so that he can steal from them. Protection of the public must therefore take centre stage and the best method to achieve protection would be a sentence of PD.

29     The last step is the length of the PD term. Whilst the principle of proportionality does not apply rigorously, it cannot be wholly disregarded (see _Sim Yeow Kee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 936</span> at \[97\]). I was unable to accept learned counsel’s submission to impose the minimum term of seven years’ which was premised on the accused’s age. There has been a clear pattern of recidivism since the 1990s. In this latest spate, he was not deterred by the six year CT term. He in fact went on to commit more offences. He has no significant protective factors. The pre-sentencing report has assessed him to be at a high risk of reoffending.

30     I agreed with the prosecution that a 12-year PD term would not be disproportionate given the severity of the present offences, the propensity to reoffend as seen from his repeated offending, the lack of any significant protective factors, and the high risk of reoffending. I noted that the accused would be around 67 when he is released. The 12-year term was backdated to the date of remand, which is 26 October 2018.
