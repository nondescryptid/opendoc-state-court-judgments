Public Order Act, Cap 257A, 2012 Rev. Ed. – Sentencing for offence under section 15(2)

25 February 2022

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

1       On 7 January 2022, Mr Jolovan Wham was found guilty after trial and convicted of one Charge in MAC 909273 of 2020 under section 15(2) of the Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed) (“POA”) for participating in an assembly which he ought reasonably to know was prohibited by an order under section 12(1) of the POA. The grounds for this court’s decision on the conviction are set out in the earlier Judgment: _PP v Wham Kwok Han Jolovan_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGMC 2</span>. After the conviction, parties sought time to put in their respective submissions on sentencing, and that was granted. Having considered the matters presented, I now impose sentence of a fine of $3,000/- in default 15 days imprisonment on Mr Wham for the offence. These are the grounds for my decision on sentence.

## The Prescribed Penalty:

2       Mr Wham’s offence under section 15(2) of the POA carries a maximum penalty of a fine of up to $5,000/-.

## The Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence:

3       The Prosecution submitted that the maximum fine of $5,000/- ought to be imposed on Mr Wham.[^1] In gist, the Prosecution indicated that this was justified given the facts and Mr Wham’s antecedents. Further justification for its stance was also taken from the only other reported decision under section 15(2) of the POA: _PP v Yan Jun_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 24</span> (“_Yan Jun_”).

## The Defence’s Submissions on Sentence:

4       The Defence submitted that a fine of no more than $1,500/- (i/d 3 days imprisonment) ought to be imposed.[^2] In gist, the Defence indicated that this was justified given the facts, and that Mr Wham was untraced for the current provision of the POA. Further justification for its stance was also taken from the same case of _Yan Jun_.

## Mitigation:

5       The Defence submissions were silent on mitigation. When queried by the court, the Defence confirmed that this was a conscious decision and nothing further was being offered for the court’s consideration.[^3]

## Decision on Sentence:

6       Given the matters presented, it was evident that the parties were agreed that sentencing had to have regard to three main aspects. The first aspect would be to the facts so as to arrive at an assessment of the culpability and the harm involved. When viewed against the statute’s intent, that will then provide a preliminary landing point as to where the sentence ought to be. Next, a consideration of the factors personal to the offender ought to be had so as to assess whether the sentence should be adjusted. Finally, regard ought to be had to any other matters which may be relevant to sentencing. This sentencing approach is well established.

7       Turning first to the facts, these are recounted in the earlier judgment. To recap, on 13 December 2018, Mr Jolovan Wham wanted to demonstrate his support for Mr Terry Xu and Mr Daniel De Costa – both of whom were about to face criminal defamation charges in court. At about 9.09 am that day, Mr Wham arrived at the main entrance to the former State Courts building and took out a sign he prepared. With the main entrance of the State Courts forming the backdrop, he arranged for a photo to be taken of himself holding up the sign, which read:

> “_Drop the charges against Terry Xu and Daniel De Costa_”

8       After that photo was taken, Mr Wham kept the sign and proceeded inside the court building to witness the charging of those two individuals.[^4] Mr Wham later made a public post on his Facebook account where he uploaded that photo of himself, tagged it _#insolidarity_ and provided an update on the outcome of the court mention for those two individuals.[^5] That post drew a multitude of reactions, shares, and comments. The facts recounted thus far are beyond dispute in the Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”).

9       The evidence presented at trial indicated that Mr Wham was familiar with the provisions of the POA which were relevant to the current charge. I had set these out at \[4\] to \[7\] of the earlier judgment. In gist, I found that Mr Wham well knew that the POA prohibited participating in an assembly outside the former State Courts building, even if the assembly involved just one person, and even if the assembly was intended to be transient. Despite all that, Mr Wham nonetheless went on to commit the present offence. All this is recounted here as it was relevant to his culpability, and they indicated that it was high. That aspect remained unmitigated before me.

10     Turning next to the issue of harm and the intent behind the provision, I had addressed these aspects at \[10\] and \[14\] of the earlier judgment. Mr Wham’s actions in monitoring the proposed actions of the Attorney-General’s Chambers against Mr Terry Xu and Mr Daniel De Costa, in deliberating on what he wanted to say publicly in response to those actions, in making preparations for that message and sign to be made, in deliberating where and when to make known his message and demonstrate his views, in making preparations with at least one other person (the photographer) to document his demonstration, and in executing the plan to broadcast his demonstration, all indicated that his conduct that morning was premeditated and calculated to the detail. The timing of the demonstration was impeccable, his message clear and pointed, his venue choice bold and shrewd, and his subsequent actions effective in maximising the impact. There was nothing superfluous and every aspect was relevant to the intent of demonstrating his direct opposition to the actions of the Attorney-General’s Chambers at the precise venue where it was to take place. All this not only confirmed the conclusion as to his culpability, but it also provided the material to make the assessment as to where harm ought to be pegged in this case. In that regard, I had in the earlier judgment stated that consideration ought to be given to the efforts made by Mr Wham to broadcast his actions, where he sought the attention of everyone that he had taken those demonstrative actions at that location in broad daylight with that message. To do otherwise would be to artificially ignore what was always intended by Mr Wham for his demonstration; and in my judgment, that would be wrong because they were all relevant to the aspect of harm (which remains the sole focus at this stage). Put another way, if this court were sentencing a Mr Wham who was indeed aspiring to pointless irrelevance by putting on a transient demonstration for its own sake and for his own idiosyncratic purposes with no one ever knowing about it, then the sentence would be very different because the aspect of harm, and the potential for it, would be very limited in that case.[^6] This court is not sentencing such a Mr Wham. In fact, this court is sentencing a Mr Wham who has by his actions shown that he had every intention for his demonstration to matter, one who aspired for it to be in the public’s consciousness, so as to sway opinion, to reinforce views and to advocate for certain positions. Indeed, that was the outcome. Beyond those explicit reactions of support which he garnered for his actions, there are untold others who may have been influenced by his actions and inspired to do the same or something similar in future. It bears reiteration that the nature of Mr Wham’s demonstration went past merely about showing solidarity with two individuals, or even about free speech; it instead involved showing direct and pointed public opposition against the one charged with the duty of upholding our laws, and it urged that due process be by-passed at the very venue of the institution charged with the duty of ensuring independent review and due process. By elevating it in that manner, and making it as if such public exploits were legitimate cause for applause and worthy of emulation, I found that the harm and the potential for it arising from Mr Wham’s actions was more than anything which could be described as _de minimis_ or negligible. Together with my observations at \[14\] of the earlier judgment, it was appropriate to peg it at moderate instead.

11     With culpability and harm thus established, if there were a sentencing framework in place for the current offence which made use of the entire penal range by distinguishing cases according to whether culpability and harm were low, moderate, or high, then the initial landing point on sentence in this case would indicate a fine range of about $3,000/- to $4,000/- to be appropriate. Deterrence remains the pre-dominant sentencing purpose being served.

12     I turn next to a consideration of the factors personal to the offender to assess whether the sentence ought to be adjusted. In that regard, nothing has been offered in terms of mitigation by Mr Wham. On the Prosecution’s part, they referred to the antecedents clocked up by Mr Wham and submitted that specific deterrence was further activated in this case. The antecedents were admitted, but the Defence submitted that they were distinct and involved different provisions in the POA.[^7] Having reviewed Mr Wham’s antecedents, I found only the following two required some address at this stage of the process:

> ■     **3 January 2019**: Mr Wham was fined $2,000/- i/d 10 days for organising a public assembly without a permit on 26 Nov 2016 to publicise the cause of “_Civil Disobedience and Democracy in Social Change_”. Conviction after trial under s 16(1)(a) of the POA. Conviction upheld by the High Court, and finally by the Court of Appeal on 6 November 2020.

> ■     **15 February 2021:** Mr Wham was fined $4,500/- i/d 18 days for organising a public assembly without a permit on 3 June 2017 on board an MRT train to commemorate “_Operation Spectrum_”. Conviction after a Plea of Guilt under s 16(1)(a) of the POA, with another similar charge being taken into consideration.

13     The Prosecution submitted that those antecedents were substantively similar and showed that Mr Wham committed the present offence (on 13 December 2018) whilst on bail and whilst under investigations for the case under s 16(1)(a) of the POA.[^8] That may be so, but I did not find that to be justification for viewing his present offence in more aggravated terms. The reason lies in a review of Mr Wham’s conduct and the timing of his cases. During that 2016-2018 period, Mr Wham was quite prolific in organizing his assemblies and showed that he revelled in conducting those affairs in what may be said to be grey areas. However, the sequence also shows that he has eventually abided by a final definitive superior court ruling on the matter. On the date of the current offence of 13 December 2018, there was yet no final definitive superior court ruling yet on his arguments as to the proper applicability of the POA – it was still a matter of contention between him and the Executive, and still then pending before the courts. Indeed, on the 13 December 2018, Mr Wham had also not been convicted for any of those cases under review. Looking back, the manner in which Mr Wham conducted his defence in the present case also appeared to be coherent with that assessment about his stance: the defence was focused and the conduct of the case precise, with little attempt to rehash contentions already settled in the previous cases. In such circumstances, I therefore did not think it was right to view his culpability here in further aggravated terms on account of his record.

14     Finally, I now turn to any other matters which may be relevant to sentencing. In that regard, both parties referred me to the _Yan Jun_ case where a fine of $3,000/- was imposed. As stated earlier, that was the only reported decision under section 15(2) of the POA. I agreed that it ought to be considered in the interests of upholding the _Rule of Law_ and parity amongst cases. It was apparent to me that culpability was similar in that case and the fine imposed cohered with the sentencing approach that had been set out earlier. The offender there knew the Istana location was a prohibited area, but chose to conduct his protest assembly there on purpose. The offender took steps to plan his protest down to the detail, and made efforts to maximise its impact as he wanted publicity for his stance. He remained unapologetic for his actions and claimed trial. That was all similar to the present case. However, unlike the present case, the offender there did not have any of the traction which Mr Wham has. Any reasonably informed person would have appreciated that the offender there was simply a single aggrieved litigant who had taken to unreasonably venting his feelings after having lost his court case. Despite all of his efforts at drawing attention, interest in his protest appeared muted apart from noting the curiosity that he was making of himself. Not so in the present. When Mr Wham demonstrated at the courts that day, he was not an aggrieved litigant; in fact, he was not even involved in that case. There was no immediately appreciable basis to account for why he was getting himself involved like that, and that makes people take notice. What Mr Wham was effectively doing was to bring his persona and influence to bear upon a pending court case in the hope that it would bring about the result which he desired. I had pointed all of this out at \[14\] of the earlier judgment, and how some court cases can elicit inflamed reactions in both directions but that such demonstrations were not constructive to their reasoned and orderly resolution. By deliberately adding his voice and persona in that manner, Mr Wham was fanning those unproductive sentiments. In that regard, the harm aspect was arguably higher in the present case. All considered though, it was my judgment that a fine of $3,000/- nonetheless remains appropriate given all the matters that I have alluded to, and I so impose. If the fine is not paid, the default imprisonment term is 15 days. This default term is in line with both Mr Wham’s antecedents and other cases of this nature.

15     The Prosecution recited Mr Wham’s track record on fine payments, but I did not think that deserved further consideration. If Mr Wham intends to serve the default term for his own purposes, it would – like the present offence – be a situation entirely of his own doing, and it would be another instance of deliberate over-consumption of limited public resources.

## Conclusion:

16     What I turn to next formed no part of the consideration on sentence. It is however being included here in closing because Mr Wham – and his supporters – remain constituents whom this court serves.

17     Whilst Mr Wham was not an aggrieved litigant when he first conducted the protest on 13 December 2018, he appeared to take on the role of one when this court issued judgment convicting him on 7 January 2022. Evidently sore at losing, Mr Wham took to behaving like a short front legged marsupial at the steps to the present court house – prancing about to the delight and encouragement of his fans and followers who recorded his actions and added it to their social media. Though that animal is admired and beloved in some quarters, it however descends to juvenile insult when invoked as a reference to the courts. That regressive commentary and resort to insult marks a departure from civil mature discourse by Mr Wham. The actions to publicise them in the few days thereafter to invite mockery upon this institution is disappointing. All this is stated here not as an acknowledgment that those actions have had any effect whatsoever on the resolve to administer justice fairly and impartially. Far from it. It is instead recited because this institution, in carrying out that duty, continues to serve all – Mr Wham and his fans and supporters included, and it is worrying when one no longer sees the kinship in the other and makes as if they were beasts instead and unworthy of their consideration as a result. When that happens, divisions form and deepen, engagement falters, and invites in hatred and discrimination to displace reason, with might ultimately becoming right – history shows this, repeatedly. It is important to know that all actually have a stake in how we turn out, and we should guard against going down that route. Perhaps it might do well for Mr Wham to dust off his _Rawlsian veil_ and engage in that thought experiment to remember again how we got here, and what is the way forward towards a better society. If that be his goal, and if he truly embraces the diversity of man, and acknowledges that none have the legitimate claim to rule – including himself – because none are omnipotent, it would not be surprising that Mr Wham’s society will actually not look much different. There would still be serious men and women being charged to do duty honestly and impartially, and should they be acceptable targets for ridicule after having done so?[^9]

18     That thought experiment aims to ensure that we do not lose perspective even as we pursue our own interests, that we always recognize our kinship with each other, and do not allow our differences to become divisive and intractable. Mr Wham is a social worker, and he has garnered a greater reputation for being a _civil society activist_; there will always be space and relevance for such persons. In some ways, we are accustomed to being charitable to those who selflessly dedicate themselves to improving the lives of others because they represent the best of us, but we must be wary the one whose commitment to being part of _civil society_ is so seemingly tenuous and feeble, shedding it at convenience and retaining only the _activist_. Where Mr Wham stands on this remains to be seen.
