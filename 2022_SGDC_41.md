The first charge was for being in possession of a controlled drug, namely not less than 60 grams of methamphetamine, for the purpose of trafficking, and the second charge was for consumption of a specified drug, namely methamphetamine. As the accused had previously been convicted of drug trafficking and drug consumption offences, both proceeded charges against him attracted enhanced punishment under the MDA.

2       The proceeded charges read:

> a)     DAC-913688-2020 (trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge)

>     You….are charged that you, on 21 July 2020 at about 1.45 a.m., at 756 Upper Serangoon Road, #06-01, Singapore 534626, did traffic in a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 60 grams of Methamphetamine, without authorisation under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) read with Section 5(2) of the said Act, and further,

>     Minimum: 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes

>     Maximum: 30 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes

> b)     DAC-913731-2020 (consumption (enhanced punishment) charge)

>     You….are charged that you, on or before 21 July 2020, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973, to wit, Methamphetamine, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the said Act, and further,

>     that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 23 May 2014 in Court 4, vide DAC1880/2014, convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, to wit, morphine, under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you are thereby liable to punishment under s 33(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Relevant Facts

4       The accused admitted to the “Statement of Facts” without qualification. I have summarised the most pertinent facts below.

5       On 21 July 2020 at about 1.45am, the accused was arrested by CNB at Blk 756 Upper Serangoon Road, Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, #06-01, Singapore 534626 (“the unit”). In the unit, officers recovered (among others) the following exhibits (collectively “the Exhibits”):

> a.     Two packets of crystalline substance marked "D1C1"

> b.     Five packets of crystalline substance marked "D1A1"

> c.     Thirteen packets of crystalline substance marked 'D1B1"

> d.     Six packets of crystalline substance marked "D1C2".

##### Facts relating to the First Charge (DAC-913688-2020) – Trafficking of controlled drug (enhanced punishment), 60 grams of methamphetamine

6       The Exhibits were analysed by the Health Sciences Authority and the results of the analysis are summarised below.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="7.42%"> <col width="18.42%"> <col width="74.16%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>No</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Marking</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Analysis</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1.</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">D1C1</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two packets containing not less than 52.41 grams of crystalline substance which was pulverized and homogenized into a powdery substance.

7       Thus, the Exhibits contained a total of not less than 226.34 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 154.44 grams of methamphetamine, which is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973.

8       Of the 154.44 grams of methamphetamine found in the Exhibits, the accused admitted ownership of 60 grams of methamphetamine. These, together with the MDMA (subject of DAC-921569-2021), was intended to be shared with his friends for their consumption when they visited the unit. He therefore possessed 60 grams of methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking, and he has thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA.

9       Before the commission of the said offence, the accused was previously convicted on 23 May 2014 of an offence of possessing a controlled drug, _to wit_, ketamine, for the purpose of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) MDA, and punished under s 33(1) of the MDA with 5 years’ imprisonment, and he was thereby liable for enhanced punishment under s 33(4A)(i) of the MDA.

##### Facts relating to the Third Charge (DAC-918731-2021) – Consumption of a specified drug (enhanced punishment) – methamphetamine

10     On 21 July 2020, the accused was escorted to Central Police Division Headquarters, CNB office, where he provided two bottles of his urine samples, which were subsequently analysed by HSA analysts who issued two certificates under section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) to confirm that methamphetamine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA, was found in his urine sample.

11     The accused admitted to consuming ‘Ice’, which is the street name for methamphetamine. He had consumed ‘Ice’ by using an improvised glass instrument. The accused did not consume ‘Ice’ at a fixed frequency. The accused’s urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine as a result of his consumption of ‘Ice’. As he was not authorized to consume a specified drug under the MDA, or the Regulations made thereunder, he has thereby committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

12     Further, before the commission of the said offence, the accused was, on 23 May 2014 convicted of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, _to wit_, morphine, under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment, and he was thereby liable to be punished under s 33(4) of the MDA.

## Antecedents

13     The accused has drug-related antecedents, with drug convictions recorded in 1978 and 2014.

14     His first drug-related convictions were for drug possession ($400 fine) and drug consumption ($400 fine) on 11 March 1978. His most recent drug-related convictions were on 23 May 2014 for:

> a.     Drug trafficking (ketamine): Sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment;

> b.     Drug possession (methamphetamine) – Sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment;

> c.     Drug consumption (morphine) – Sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment; and

> d.     Possession of utensils for drug consumption – Sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment.

15     His drug antecedents explained why he was liable for enhanced punishment for the present drug trafficking and drug consumption charges.

16     In addition, the accused was committed to a drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) on three occasions in 1981, 1984 and 1986, and he was also placed under drug supervision in 1983, 1985 and 2016.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

17     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of 14 to 15 years’ imprisonment consisting of the following consecutive sentences:

> a.     DAC-913688-2020 (trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge):11 to 12 years’ imprisonment; and

> b.     DAC-913731-2020 (consumption (enhanced punishment) charge): At least 3 years’ imprisonment (mandatory minimum).

18     The sentence for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge was essentially worked out as follows:

> a.     The sentencing framework promulgated by the High Court in _PP v Lai Teck Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 852</span> (“_Lai Teck Guan”)_, set out sentencing guidelines that apply for trafficking of diamorphine.

> b.     Based on the formula set out in _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span> (“_Loo Pei Xiang Alan”)_, where the High Court held that an offender who traffics one gram of diamorphine is as culpable as someone who traffics 16.7g of methamphetamine, the accused’s present offence of trafficking 60 grams of methamphetamine is comparable to an act of trafficking 3.593 grams of diamorphine (rounded to 3 decimal places).

> c.     This meant that the sentence that should be imposed on the accused should range from 11 to 15 years’ imprisonment, and 10 to 12 strokes of the cane. In the present case, the Prosecution submitted that a sentence in the range of 11 to 12 years’ imprisonment was appropriate in light of the accused’s age.

> d.     Separately, even though the accused could not be caned because of his age, the Prosecution did not seek any imprisonment in lieu of caning.

19     As for the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge, the Prosecution sought the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment, even though it pointed out that an uplift would have been warranted in light of the accused’s previous 3 years’ imprisonment sentence imposed in 2014 for an identical offence. However, the DPP indicated that the Prosecution was not seeking any uplift in the present case so as to ensure that the global sentence imposed on the accused was not crushing.

20     The Prosecution further submitted that both imprisonment sentences imposed should run consecutively, for a global term of 14 – 15 years’ imprisonment, as each offence violates a different legally protected interest. Running both sentences consecutively would also be commensurate both to his overall offending (as he faced six charges in total), and be in line with the principle of specific deterrence due to his chequered past involvement with drug offences. The Prosecution concluded that a global sentence of 14 - 15 years’ imprisonment was not crushing.

## Mitigation Plea

21     In her mitigation plea dated 8 February 2022, Ms Stephania Wong, counsel for the accused, submitted for the following concurrent sentences:

> a.     DAC-913688-2020 (trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge): 12 years’ imprisonment; and

> b.     DAC-913731-2020 (consumption (enhanced punishment) charge): 3 years’ imprisonment (mandatory minimum).

22     The global sentence sought was thus 12 years’ imprisonment. The main arguments put forward by the Defence are set out below.

23     First, as regards the sentence for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge, the Defence agreed with the Prosecution’s approach which was based on the guidance of the High Court in _Lai Teck Guan_ and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan._ Accordingly, the Defence submitted that a starting sentence of 6 years’ imprisonment and an uplift of 6 years’ imprisonment, giving rise to an aggregate sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment for this charge would be appropriate in the present case.[^1] In support of its position, the Defence highlighted that:

> a.     There was no financial gain made by the accused from his offence as he simply allowed his friends to have access to his own supply of drugs when they visited his house to gamble, and he shared the drugs with them.[^2]

> b.     While he was not a first-time offender, the present drug trafficking charge, together with one other TIC (drug trafficking) charge under s 5(1)(a) MDA, represented a de-escalation from his previous convictions in 2014, where he was convicted of trafficking in four (4) different types of drugs.

> c.     The accused was turning 62 years old this year, and his father was currently above 90 years old. The mandatory minimum sentence for the drug trafficking charge alone would not only bring the accused into his 70s, but also take a physical toll on him.

24     As regards the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge, the Defence argued that in the absence of any aggravating factors, the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment would suffice.

25     As for the global sentence:

> a.     The Defence argued that the one-transaction rule applies when deciding whether the court ought to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences of imprisonment, and that where two or more offences are committed in the course of a single transaction, all sentences in respect of these offences should be concurrent instead of consecutive.

> b.     In the present case, the one-transaction rule applies to both charges, which were related to each other. Further, on account of the accused’s old age and based on compassionate grounds, a sentence of more than a decade would already have a sufficiently punishing effect on him. Accordingly, the sentences for both charges should run concurrently for a global sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment.

26     The Defence also requested that the accused’s sentence be backdated to the date of his arrest on 21 July 2020.

## Decision on Sentence

27     It was clear from the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and counsel’s mitigation plea that there was broad agreement on the individual sentences for each of the two charges. In fact, the Defence even suggested that the sentence for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge be set at 12 years’ imprisonment, which was higher than the lowest range of the 11 – 12 years’ imprisonment sentence suggested by the Prosecution. For the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge, both the Prosecution and Defence were broadly in agreement that the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment was sufficient. Thus, the only real dispute was whether the sentences for the individual charges should run concurrently or consecutively, and hence what the aggregate sentence should be.

### Principles for sentencing of a multiple offender

28     In deciding on the approach to sentencing in the present case, I turned to the decision of the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> (“_Raveen_”) for guidance. In _Raveen_, Menon CJ had set out an analytical framework for sentencing a multiple offender i.e. an offender who is to be sentenced for convictions on multiple offences.

29     A summary of the relevant principles can be found at \[98\] of that judgment. I set out the relevant extracts below:

> 98    In summary, the relevant principles in sentencing a multiple offender are as follows:

>> (a)    The first stage of the sentencing analysis is for the sentencing court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence…. In arriving at the individual sentences, the sentencing court will generally have to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each discrete sentence (see \[37\] above).

>> (b)    The second stage of the sentencing analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. In this regard, the starting point of the analysis is whether the offences are unrelated and this is determined by considering whether they involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest (see \[68\]–\[70\] above). As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC.…

>> (c)    The third stage of the sentencing analysis is to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality (see \[73\] above). Specifically, there are two limbs to the totality principle. First, the court should examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Second, the court should examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects….

>> (d)    Across all stages of the analysis, the sentencing court should be careful not to offend the rule against double counting….It applies to both aggravating and mitigating factors, and it may arise in cases involving single offences as it does in cases involving multiple offending. However, it does not necessarily violate the rule against double counting if a fact constituting a mitigating factor is again taken into account in the application of the totality principle even though it has been given effect to elsewhere in the sentencing analysis (see \[91\]–\[94\] above).

30     In line with Menon CJ’s approach, I will first determine the sentences for the individual charges, before deciding how the individual sentences should run, and finally apply the totality principle and take a \`last look’.

### Stage 1: Determining the sentence for the individual charge

#### Sentence for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge

31     Both parties agreed that the sentence for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge for the 60 grams of methamphetamine should be derived by applying the sentencing framework set out in _Lai Teck Guan_ (for diamorphine), as adjusted for methamphetamine based on the formula set out in _Loo Pei Xiang Alan._

32     Essentially, in _Lai Teck Guan_, the High Court had set out the sentencing framework for first-time offenders and repeat offenders trafficking in _diamorphine_ as follows (at \[42\]):

33     In _Loo Pei Xiang_, the High Court decided that based on parity between the statutory sentencing ranges, 1g of _diamorphine_ should be equivalent to 16.7g of _methamphetamine_. Thus, applying the conversion ratio between diamorphine and methamphetamine in _Loo Pei Xiang_ to the sentencing framework in _Lai Teck Guan_, the framework for repeat offenders trafficking in methamphetamine can be extrapolated in the following terms:

34     Thereafter, applying the framework at \[33\] above, for the present trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge involving trafficking of 60 grams of methamphetamine, this would give rise to a indicative starting sentence of 6 - 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 - 7 strokes of the cane, with an indicative uplift of 5 - 8 years’ imprisonment and 4 - 5 strokes of the cane (see the part highlighted above). The aggregate sentence should therefore be 11 - 15 years’ imprisonment and 10 - 12 strokes of the cane.

35     In the present case, for this charge, the Prosecution had argued for a sentence of at least 11 years’ imprisonment for the accused, and the Defence had submitted for 12 years’ imprisonment. Both parties had cited the old age of the accused as a reason for their respective proposed sentences. The Defence also cited the lack of financial gain on the accused’s part when he provided the drugs to his friends, and argued that the accused’s current offence was less severe than his previous drug trafficking offences in 2014.

36     In deciding on the sentence to impose, I was of the view that as regards the accused’s age of 61 years, while old age alone would not generally warrant a reduction in sentence, I accepted that in the context of the length of imprisonment that he faced, some moderation in sentence could be made on account of his age (see _Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span> at \[93\] and \[94\]).

37     However, as for the accused’s supposed lack of financial gains, and the fact that he apparently trafficked in fewer types of drugs in the present case than he did when he was convicted in 2014, with respect, these factors were not really of any mitigating value in that they were not considerations that the accused could be given credit for. At most, they could be considered as neutral factors. As noted by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in _Public Prosecutor v AOM_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1057</span> at \[37\]:

>     … The consideration and balancing of mitigating and aggravating factors is not a zero-sum process. As a matter of jurisprudential logic, the absence of an aggravating factor cannot ipso facto constitute a mitigating factor. This is because a mitigating factor is something which an accused is given credit for …, and it cannot be said that the absence of an aggravating factor is something which the accused should be given credit for…

\[emphasis added\]

38     Nonetheless, I saw no reason to impose an imprisonment term higher than the lowest end of the imprisonment range proposed by the Prosecution, bearing in mind the accused’s age and his plea of guilt. I thus sentenced the accused to 11 years’ imprisonment for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge. In line with the positions of the Prosecution and the Defence, I also declined to impose any sentence of imprisonment in lieu of caning.

#### Sentence for the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge

39     Both parties broadly agreed that the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment would suffice for this charge.

40     While I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift could have been warranted since the accused had already been sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment in 2014 for an identical offence, and that sentence had not deterred his re-offending, on balance and after considering the rather lengthy sentence already imposed for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge, I declined to impose anything beyond the mandatory minimum sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment for the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge.

### Stage 2: Deciding whether the offences are related

41     The second stage of the analysis involved making a determination whether the offences that the accused was charged with are related. For this assessment, there was a need to consider whether the offences involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest.

42     As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences which form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed (“CPC”).

43     In the present case, the nature of the two offences that the accused was convicted of were clearly different. The trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge involved the accused being in the possession of the illicit drugs for the purpose of trafficking through his making the illicit drugs available for consumption by his friends. In contrast, the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge involved his ingesting the illicit substance himself.

44     I agreed with the Prosecution that each of these offences violated a different legally protected interest, with the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge having at its core harming others through supplying them with illegal drugs, while the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge involved his harming himself through feeding his own addiction. They were unrelated offences, and each offence should thus attract its own distinct punishment. Indeed, as noted by CJ Menon in _Raveen_ at \[42\] “(a)ll else being equal, a multiple offender bears greater culpability and will have caused greater harm than an offender who has committed only a single offence.”

45     I would add that the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge also involved the accused being in possession of drugs which were intended for trafficking, where the actual trafficking of the drugs to his friends would take place in the future i.e. after the raid on the unit. In contrast, the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge involved his ingestion of the drugs even before the raid on the unit occurred. The two offences could thus hardly be said to form part of a single transaction.

46     Thus, it was clear that the individual sentences imposed for the two quite separate offences, should also run quite separately from each other. Accordingly, consecutive sentences, rather than concurrent sentences, had to be imposed to give real effect and actual recognition to the accused’s greater culpability in the commission of these offences. Indeed, doing otherwise - by making the sentences run concurrently - would effectively mean allowing the accused, a multiple offender, to escape any punishment for his separate offending for his own drug consumption, since that punishment would be subsumed within the sentence imposed for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge. With respect, that “…would be a perverse outcome that flies in the face of any notion of justice” (as per Menon CJ at \[46\] of _Raveen_).

47     In short, running the sentences for the two charges consecutively for an aggregate sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment was the fair and obvious course.

### Stage 3: Totality principle and \`last look’

48     This final stage of the framework is to “…apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality”. As regards the totality principle, the court should:

> a.     First, examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed.

> b.     Second, examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.

49     In the present case, as regards the most serious of the individual offences i.e. the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge (DAC-913688-2020), I took into account the fact that the sentence should range from 11 to 15 years’ imprisonment and 10-12 strokes of the cane (with a possible 12 months’ imprisonment in lieu of caning).[^3]

50     Further, I considered the accused’s 4 TIC charges, which were all for serious drug related offences, and that they included another charge for drug trafficking involving enhanced punishment, and two charges for drug possession also involving enhanced punishment. [^4]Such TIC charges should normally result in a sentence that gravitated towards the higher end of the range for the trafficking (enhanced punishment) charge, even though I eventually imposed a sentence that was at the lowest end of the range, for the reasons set out above.

51     Thus, all things considered, it was clear that the aggregate sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment that I imposed for both charges, through making the sentences for these two charges run consecutively, was clearly not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed.

52     Separately, bearing in mind the accused’s dismal drug record which spanned from 1978, and which record included other forms of intervention such as admissions to the DRC in 1981, 1984 and 1986, and placement under drug supervision in 1983, 1985 and 2016, it could also not be said that the effect of the sentence on the accused would be crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.

53     Finally, taking one ‘last look’ at the aggregate sentence, I saw no basis to adjust the aggregate sentence to anything lower than 14 years’ imprisonment imposed, as this term of imprisonment was fair, proportionate, and in line with the circumstances of the case and the relevant sentencing principles. I also backdated his sentence to the date of his arrest i.e. 21 July 2020, in line with the application of his counsel.

54     The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his imprisonment sentence.
