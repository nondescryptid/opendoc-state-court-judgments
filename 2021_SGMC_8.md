### District Judge Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 53-year-old female, claimed trial to four charges of abusing her domestic maid, and one charge of mischief, allegedly committed over a one-and-a-half year period from 16 July 2016 to 4 December 2017. At the end of the trial, I acquitted the Accused of all charges. The Prosecution has filed the present appeal against the Accused’s acquittal.

## Background

2       The complainant is Hrang Thanh Kim (“**Kim**”), a Myanmar national. Kim began working for the Accused as a foreign domestic worker (“**FDW**”) on 16 July 2016. Kim was placed by her maid agency, the Bukit Timah branch of Budget Employment Pte Ltd (“**Budget Maid**”). Budget Maid has offices in various parts of Singapore, including Bukit Timah Plaza and in Woodlands.

3       This was Kim’s first employment stint in Singapore, and the Accused was her first employer here. Kim worked for the Accused and her family, comprising the Accused’s son and two daughters. The Accused and her family initially resided at a unit at Block 721, Woodlands Circle, Singapore 730721 (the “**Woodlands Circle Flat**”) until November 2017, when the household moved to a unit at Block 785D, Woodlands Rise, Singapore 734785 (the “**Woodlands Rise Flat**”).

4       The Accused is a production worker at a local factory. It was not disputed that the Accused worked long hours (including overtime), except on one to two days per week on her off-days. At the relevant time, the Accused was also pursuing a part time diploma offered by the PSB Academy. During the trial, the Accused testified in Mandarin with the assistance of a court interpreter as she stated she was not proficient in the English language.

5       On 4 December 2017, approximately one-and-a-half years after Kim started working for the Accused, Kim ran away from the Accused’s flat and sought help from the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (“**HOME**”) counter at Peninsula Plaza. When Kim was brought to the police station on the same day, she was observed to have a dark bruise on her right eyelid region. No injuries were, however, noted in her right eye. Kim subsequently alleged that the Accused had physically abused her on multiple occasions.

## The Charges

6       The following five charges were preferred against the Accused consequent upon Kim’s complaints and the ensuing police investigations:

### The first alleged assault

8       The Prosecution’s case[^1] was that three days after Kim began working for the Accused, the Accused slapped her on the face because Kim did not do her work properly (the “**First Incident**”). Thereafter, the Accused hit Kim on many occasions, when she did not like her work. However, Kim was only able to recall five of them clearly, including the First Incident. No charges were preferred by the Prosecution against the Accused in respect of the First Incident. The remaining four incidents form the subject matter of the s 323 PC charges against the Accused.

### The first and second charges

9       The incidents in respect of the first two charges arose from the same chain of events. Kim’s testimony was that on or about the seventh, eighth, or ninth day after she started working for the Accused,the Accused instructed her to clean the refrigerator. It was the Accused’s off-day. The Accused woke up late at around 10 am – 12 pm.When the Accused walked into the kitchen and saw that Kim had taken food out of the refrigerator and placed it on the newspaper on the floor, the Accused became upset. She told Kim that she should have placed the food on the table instead.The Accused then slapped Kim on her left cheek, causing Kim to feel pain and to cry (the “**Second Incident**”). The forms the subject matter of the first s. 323 PC charge.

10     When the Accused saw Kim crying, this angered the Accused further. The Accused proceeded to take Kim’s belongings out from a kitchen cupboard, where Kim’s belongings were stored, and threw them on the floor. She then picked up Kim’s yellow coloured diary, which was one-quarter the size of an A4 page, in which Kim had written about her feelings and prayers.The Accused allegedly then tore off one or two pages from the diary and threw the pages into the dustbin, before throwing the diary back amongst Kim’s belongings. This forms the subject matter of the second charge (the “**Mischief Charge**”). Kim stated that there was no one else around at the time of the incident.

11     The diary was not produced in court as Kim claimed she had lost it. The Prosecution, however, tendered a list of her declared items (Exhibit P11), signed on the day that she went to the Accused’s house, which indicated that Kim had a “notebook’ with her when she first arrived at the Accused’s flat.

12     After the abovementioned events, Kim told the Accused that she wanted a change of employer. The Accused called Budget Maid and complained that Kim did not know how to work. Kim then spoke to a member of staff whom she knew as “Esther”, who could speak Kim’s Myanmese native Chin dialect.In the course of the trial, it was established that “Esther” was actually one Tin Naing Maw (“**Esther**”). Esther had left Singapore on 7 February 2017. Esther was not an employee of the Bukit Timah branch of Budget Maid. She worked for various Budget Maid offices, providing interpretation services when the maids concerned only spoke the Chin dialect. Kim testified that when she told Esther that the Accused had hit her and that she wanted a change of employer, Esther replied that she would have to pay the agency an additional two months of “agency loan” to do so.Esther also told Kim that the agency would speak to the Accused, and that the Accused would not hit Kim anymore.Kim continued working for the Accused on account of these assurances.

### The third charge

13     The event that gave rise to the third charge occurred three months after Kim started working for the Accused, sometime in October 2016. Kim did not pinpoint the exact day the incident happened, except that it occurred at about 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. According to Kim, she was doing house cleaning work at the relevant time. The Accused blamed her for not doing her work properly and slapped Kim’s left cheek with her right hand, causing Kim to feel pain (the “**Third Incident**”). Again, there was no one around at the material time.

14     Following the Third Incident, Kim testified that she could not take being hit anymore and told the Accused that she wanted to go back to the agent or to return to Myanmar.The Accused replied that she would need to repay a sum of money as she had not finished paying off her agency loan. The Accused then left the house.According to Kim, she then called the Accused on the house phone and told the Accused that she would go to the police or the Ministry of Manpower (“**MOM**”) if the Accused did not let her return to the agency or back to Myanmar.

15     Kim testified that after her telephone conversation with the Accused, Kim received a call from Esther on the house phone. When Kim told her the Accused had hit her and that she wanted a change of employer or to go home, Esther reminded her that she would need to pay another two months’ “agency loan” if she wanted to change employers. Esther also asked Kim if “\[her\] employer hit \[her\], is that going to kill \[you\]?”. Kim stated that after hearing Esther’s response, she realised that the agency would not help her, and decided she would not talk to them anymore.She resolved to keep working for the Accused until the end of the six-month period to repay her agency loan, and for a month thereafter to save up money to purchase a return ticket. She would try to go home after that.

### The fourth charge

16     According to Kim, this incident occurred before Chinese New Year in 2017 (“**CNY 2017**”).The Accused had instructed Kim to clean the house thoroughly to attract good luck.When the Accused came home that night, she felt Kim had not done her work properly and slapped her on the left cheek with her right hand once (hereinafter, the “**Fourth Incident**” or the “**CNY 2017 Incident**”).According to Kim, at the time she was slapped, the Accused’s daughters were at home, but were inside their rooms.

17     Kim cried because she felt sad that the Accused was not pleased with her work despite her efforts. When the Accused saw Kim crying she reportedly told Kim not to cry inside the house and to go outside if she wanted to cry. Kim complied and went to the void deck. The Accused and her daughter subsequently came to look for her and called her back into the house.

#### Period post CNY 2017

18     The Accused sold her Woodlands Circle Flat and moved to the Woodlands Rise Flat in November 2017. Kim testified that she asked multiple times to return home in 2017. However, the Accused kept requesting her to stay until the flat was sold. After the flat was _sold_, Kim revisited the issue of returning home, whereupon the Accused asked Kim stay until they had _moved_ to the new Woodlands Rise Flat. Kim claimed she acceded to each of these requests as she wanted to earn more money; in any event, she thought she would not be working for the Accused for very much longer.When they finally moved to the Woodlands Rise Flat in mid-November 2017, Kim raised the topic of returning to Myanmar again. On this occasion, she claimed the Accused asked her to stay until after Chinese New Year of 2018.Kim stood her ground and refused as she felt she had waited for too long.

19     When Kim requested to go home again on 23 November 2017, the Accused finally agreed. On 27 November 2017, the Accused got his son to purchase a ticket for Kim to return to Myanmar with a departure date of 21 December 2017.Kim was happy to learn that she was going home soon.

### The fifth charge

20     The incident relating to the 5th charge occurred on 4 December 2017, the day Kim ran away, at about 11.00 a.m. or 12 noon. This was approximately 17 days before Kim’s scheduled departure date of 21 December 2017.

21     Kim testified that after she had turned down the Accused’s request to stay until after Chinese New Year 2018, the Accused became unhappy with Kim and kept finding fault with her work. The day in question was the Accused’s off-day. The Accused had just gotten up from bed.Kim was doing household chores in the kitchen when the Accused scolded Kim for not doing her work properly. Kim felt unhappy as she was doing her best, and she thought this might have showed in her expression. When the Accused saw this, the Accused hit Kim on her left cheek.When Kim cried, the Accused hit her on both cheeks with both hands about four or five times, causing her to feel pain.Kim cried even harder. The Accused then poked Kim’s right eye repeatedly with her index finger, causing her pain (hereinafter, the “**Fifth Incident**” or the “**4 December 2017 Incident**”).Kim subsequently developed bruising on her right eyelid as shown in the photographs exhibited as P4 (taken by Insp Eunice Yeo (PW2)) and P3 (taken by a police photographer). When Kim was examined at Changi General Hospital that night, she was noted to have suffered “bruising … over the right periorbital region with erythema seen at the right zygomatic area. … Diagnosis was that of a contusion face (sic).”[^2]

22     Kim explained that she did not move at all when the Accused repeatedly poked her eye as the Accused was very angry, and was her employer.Kim also said that even if she ran away, the Accused would have followed her.Kim stated that both the Accused’s daughters were at home but were in their rooms at the material time, and did not witness the incident.

#### Kim running away

23     Following the Fifth incident, Kim decided to run away because this was the worst beating that the Accused had inflicted on her. Kim stated that she was “afraid” to remain in the house. The Accused went out shortly after assaulting her. Kim finished the housework assigned to her by the Accused, viz. arranging the flowerpots and throwing some rubbish downstairs. Thereafter, she took only her ez-Link card and a house key with her, and left the flat.

24     At around 2.14 pm, Kim boarded a bus headed for Causeway Point. Kim testified that she wanted to seek help from the maid agency. However, she did not know how to go to the Bukit Timah Plaza office of Budget Maid on her own by public transportand did not have money for a cab. Hence,she decided to go to Causeway Point to look for a Budget Maid officeas she recalled that Budget Maid had an outlet in Woodlands. She believed that she could find it at Causeway Point given that Causeway Point was next to Woodlands MRT station.

25     When Kim was unable to locate the Woodlands office of Budget Maid at Causeway Point, she took the MRT to Peninsula Plaza to seek help in locating the agency.There, an unknown lady that she spoke to brought her to the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (“**HOME**”) counter within the building.Kim was then moved to another HOME centre where she was interviewed about her employment with the Accused and the latter’s abuse. Kim was then escorted to the police station by a HOME representative.

## Prosecution’s Submissions

### Overview

26     The Prosecution submits that it has proven its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt for the following reasons:

> (a)     Kim was a truthful and candid witness whose evidence passed the “unusually convincing” threshold;

> (b)     Kim’s evidence was externally consistent with and corroborated by external sources of evidence, particularly with respect to the Fifth Charge;

> (c)     Kim had no reason to lie or frame the Accused; and

> (d)     The defence was not credible.

### Kim not running away earlier should not be taken against her

27     It was not disputed that Kim had worked with the Accused for close to a-year-and-a-half before running away. The Prosecution argued that Kim’s failure to run away earlier, and her failure to complain about the alleged abuses to MOM or the police, was reasonable and understandable in the circumstances.

28     Prosecution submitted that Kim had, in fact, complained about the Accused’s abuse to Esther on three occasions – (a) first, around the time of the Second Incident (i.e. July 2016), (b) second, on the day of her work permit registration (i.e. 1 August 2016) when she visited the Bukit Timah office of Budget Maid; and (c) third, around the time of the Third Incident (i.e. in October 2016). Specifically, on the second occasion, while she as at Budget Maid’s office, she also spoke to two other Budget Maid staff – i.e. DW2 Kelly Leong, and one Siti Haslinda Binte Abdul Kadir (“**Shalynn**”) – about the abuse, but did not think they understood her because of her poor English. As for the occasions when she complained to Esther about having been abused by the Accused, she claimed Esther responded with complete indifference and apathy. This led Kim to conclude that the agency staff would not help her.

29     In addition, Kim also had to repay her agency loan, which amounted to six-months of her salary. Kim also heard from other maids in Singapore that if she left Singapore before repaying the loan in full, she would have problems coming back to Singapore to work. On the other hand, if she sought a change of employers, Esther had previously told her that she would need to pay the agency an additional two months’ salary. This was a very substantial amount from Kim’s perspective. Citing the High Court decision of _Janardana Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span>, Prosecution submitted that these were legitimate fears and concerns faced by FDWs when contemplating making complaints against their employers.

### Reasons why Kim stayed for 11 months after CNY 2017

30     As for why Kim stayed on after the CNY 2017 Incident despite having paid off her agency loan in full by then, Prosecution argued that this was because Kim wanted to earn more money before returning home. She did not in any event think that she would be working for very much longer. Kim also testified that she found the Accused to be “good” to her apart from hitting her. Further, the Accused had also hit her less frequently in 2017 compared to 2016because Kim’s work had improved.

31     Prosecution submits that Kim has adequately explained why she did not report the Accused to the police or MOM. First, she did not want to cause problems for the Accused as the latter was “good to \[her\]” apart from the times the Accused hit her. Secondly, she thought that if she made a complaint, she would have to stay in Singapore for a long time until investigations were completed, during which time she would have to stop working, and this would entail a loss of income for her.

## THE DEFENCE’S SUBMISSIONS

### Overview

32     The Accused denied ever assaulting Kim, and called the following witnesses in support of her defence:

33     The defence pointed out that Accused has employed a domestic helper for her family for more than 20 years prior to Kim’s employment in July 2016. Prior to Kim’s employment, the Accused has had six or seven previous domestic helpers, and had encountered no issues or received any complaints from them.

34     Counsel further pointed out that Kim’s work, as evident from her own testimony in court, was relatively undemanding. The Accused and her three children were not at home most of the time. When the Accused went to work at the factory, the Accused would not be home from 7.00 am to 11.00 pm. Kim was further not required to, and did not, cook for the family. She was only required to do household chores like cleaning, mopping, washing toilets and clothes, and ironing. On days when the Accused was working, Kim would practically be the only person at home during the daytime. She was permitted to and did take naps and watch television programs after she had finished her chores. All these were not disputed by Kim in the course of the trial.

35     Counsel also highlighted that Kim was given significant freedom to leave the flat, and did in fact do so. Among other things, Kim was given the house keys, an ez-link card and a wallet with money in it (about S$30.00). Kim did not deny all these, except she claimed there was no money in the wallet. However, she conceded she was allowed to, and did, leave the flat frequently by herself to buy lunch or other necessities. She admitted to taking the bus or the MRT to Causeway Point and going to the neighbourhood minimart and shops on her own, on many occasions.

36     Indeed, for a continuous period of five days from 1 December 2016 to 5 December 2016, Kim was staying in the flat all by herself when Accused and her three children were away on a family holiday to Korea. During that period, Kim left the flat daily to buy food and was allowed to travel with her ez-Link card.

37     Kim was also given access to the house telephone and, from around July 2017 onwards, her own handphone on which she accessed online chat platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Further, right from the start of her employment with the Accused, Kim was given access to a list of important telephone numbers, which included those of the Ministry of Manpower, the Police, Budget Maid, the Accused and her three children. All these were pasted on a wall next to the house phone, and was not disputed by Kim.

38     In addition to having significant freedom to leave the flat on a daily basis, from July 2017 onwards, Kim also met up with her cousins and attended church services on her day off, which was usually the last Sunday of the month. Despite all these, Defence pointed out that no witnesses came to court, and no documentary proof (e.g. text messages to friends and/or relatives) was adduced, to corroborate Kim’s claim of prior assault by the Accused.

### Defendant’s specific rebuttal of the Charges

#### First and Second Charge

39     In response to the Prosecution’s case that the assault, which formed the subject matter of the First Charge, took place at between 11.00 am to 12.00 pm on 23rd, 24th or 25th of July 2016, Defence argued that the Accused was not at home at the stated time on each of these three days. On 23 July 2016 (a Saturday), the Accused had left home at 7.00 am for work and had only returned home at 10.00 pm. That the Accused worked long hours was not seriously disputed by the Prosecution. On 24 July 2016 (a Sunday), the Accused had left for church service with her children at around 9.00 am and returned home at about 4.00 to 5.00 pm, as was her usual Sunday routine. On 25th July 2016 (a Monday), the Accused had left home at around 10.00 or 11.00 am to meet her classmate and to print the lesson notes for the course she was attending.

40     Counsel pointed out that Kim’s testimony as regards the Second Incident was wholly uncorroborated by any witness account or extrinsic evidence. While Kim contended that she told Esther, DW2 Kelly Leong and Shalynn of the incident at the work permit briefing on 1 August 2016, none of them corroborated Kim’s account of the event. Esther was never called as a witness as the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“**ICA**”) record showed that Esther had left Singapore since 7 February 2017 (Exhibit P8). Shalynn was also not called by the Prosecution to support Kim’s contention, despite the fact that Shalynn is still being employed by Budget Maid. In fact, the only witness from Budget Maid who was called at trial, DW2 Kelly Leong, testified that she had no recollection of any complaints from Kim about being assaulted by the Accused.

41     As for the Mischief Charge involving the tearing of pages from Kim’s notebook, Counsel noted that this claim was again based on Kim’s uncorroborated testimony. No one was informed of this incident and no one came forward to support Kim’s claim. The diary was also never tendered as evidence given Kim’s testimony that she had lost the diary. Indeed, when asked whether the diary meant much to her, Kim said it was “not important” to her[^3].

#### The Third Charge

42     With respect to the Third Charge, which involved Accused allegedly slapping Kim once on her cheek at the Woodlands Circle Flat sometime in October 2016, Defence submitted this was again not corroborated by any independent witnesses or evidence at trial. In fact, Kim could not remember on which day she was allegedly slapped (whether a weekday or weekend). She also could not remember what Accused was doing before she was allegedly slapped, except that she (Kim) was cleaning the house at that time. By her own testimony, there was no one else at home at the time of the incident.

43     Again, while Kim testified that she informed Esther of the incident, Esther was never called as a witness at trial to corroborate her account.

#### The Fourth Charge

44     The Accused denied slapping Kim on her cheek in the period leading up to CNY 2017, i.e. between 21 January 2017 and 28 January 2017, at the Woodlands Circle flat. The Accused, however, recounted an incident on Chinese New Year’s eve involving Kim.

45     That day, the Accused had returned home at 8.00 pm. She needed help to change the bed sheets in the bedroom and called out to Kim. As Kim did not respond, the Accused started changing the bed sheet by herself. By the time Kim got to the bedroom, the Accused told Kim, “I do it, I do myself, you go out first”. Moments later, when Accused needed Kim to take the changed old bed sheets to the kitchen to soak, she called out to Kim again. When there was no response from Kim, the Accused went around the flat to look for Kim, but could not find her. The Accused and her elder daughter, DW4 Yueh Wan, then went down to the void deck to look for Kim. Eventually, they found her sitting on a void deck bench two to three blocks away. When Kim was asked why she had left the flat, Kim said it was because Accused had earlier told her “You go out!”. It was then that Accused realized that there was a misunderstanding. Kim had mistaken the Accused asking her to “go out” to the living room (as the Accused had already started and was going to complete changing the bed sheets by herself) as asking Kim to get out of the flat. After the air was cleared, all three of them (Kim, Accused and DW4 Yueh Wan) went back to the flat.

46     The Accused’s testimony was corroborated and confirmed by her elder daughter, DW4 Yueh Wan, who was home at the relevant time. DW4 testified that she heard Kim say “sorry” to the Accused when the Accused asked Kim why she was outside the house in the void deck area. The Accused replied with the words “it’s OK” after the misunderstanding was clarified[^4]. In this regard, the Accused’s account of what transpired on CNY 2017 eve was consistent with the police statement she lodged on 4 December 2017 – see Exhibit D7.

#### The Fifth Charge

47     As regards the Fifth Charge, the Accused categorically denied slapping Kim multiple times and repeatedly poking her right eye on 4 December 2017.

48     The Accused claimed that about a week after the Accused moved to the Woodlands Rise flat, on 23 November 2017 at 4.30 pm, she received a WhatsApp message from Kim sent saying that she needed to go home. The content of the WhatsApp message will be discussed in greater detail below. As the Accused was then at work, she did not speak to Kim until later that day when she telephoned Kim. Kim told the Accused that her grandparents were ill and that she wanted to return to Myanmar to be with them. The Accused contacted the maid agency about Kim’s request, and eventually agreed to let her return to Myanmar.

49     Four days later, on 27 November 2017, the Accused took Kim out for shopping at Causeway Point shopping mall. According to the Accused, Kim had worked hard during the house move and since she was about to return to Myanmar, the Accused thought it would be a good time to reward Kim. Photographs of their outing to Causeway Point shopping mall were taken. One photograph showing the Accused and Kim smiling and posing with a handbag, which Accused later bought for Kim, was admitted and marked as “D4”.

50     Accused testifed that during the outing on 27 November 2017, Kim told the Accused that she wanted to be back in Myanmar before Christmas as her uncle’s son was going back to Myanmar before Christmas day. Kim showed the Accused a copy of her uncle’s son on her phone. Though the Accused had hoped for Kim to stay till CNY 2018, she agreed to Kim’s request. After discussing with Kim, it was mutually decided that Kim would depart on 21 December 2017 so that she would be back at home by Christmas.

51     That very night, Accused got her son, DW3 Nicholas, to purchase an air-ticket for Kim with a scheduled departure date of 21 December 2017. It was not disputed that a screenshot of the air-ticket (Exhibit D10) was then shown to Kim.

52     Accused testified that about two days later, on 29 or 30 November 2017, Kim told Accused that she wanted to return to Myanmar immediately as her uncle’s son was then already back in Myanmar, and would be going overseas again “on the New Year”. On the night of 30 November 2017, Accused checked with her son, DW3 Nicholas, whether it was possible to bring forward the flight departure date for Kim. After checking, DW3 Nicholas indicated that any change would incur substantial fees, possibly more than the price of the ticket. The Accused subsequently told Kim that they should stick with the original departure date.

53     On the morning of 4 December 2017, Accused woke up at around 11.00 am as it was her off-day. She claimed she saw Kim sitting on the kitchen floor looking troubled. When she approached Kim, she saw that Kim was crying. Kim told her she wanted to go back to Myanmar immediately and did not want to wait anymore. The Accused told Kim that she had already planned to go to the Budget Maid office that very day to cancel her work permit. This was consistent with the police statement made by the Accused on 4 December 2017 – see Exhibit D7. As Kim looked troubled, the Accused asked Kim to arrange and pot the plants outside the flat. The Accused then left the flat at around 12.00 pm. Both the Accused’s daughters were at home that morning, but were in their rooms. The Accused’s younger daughter, DW5 Yueh Xin, however came out at one point and said goodbye to the Accused at the door before the Accused left the house.

54     After the Accused left the flat, Kim potted the plants, as directed by Accused, and threw away some rubbish downstairs. Thereafter, Kim left the flat by herself with the house keys and ez-link card without telling anyone.

55     The Accused’s daughters discovered Kim was missing when they were about to cook lunch for themselves and wanted to ask Kim if she needed lunch. The Accused only realized that Kim had left the flat by herself without informing anyone when she received a phone message from DW5 Yueh Xin. Accused then asked DW5 Yueh Xin to look for Kim downstairs.

56     While Accused was at the maid agency, she told the agency that Kim had gone missing. The agency told Accused to go home to see if Kim had returned, and if not, to report to the police. That night, Accused made a missing person report at the neighbourhood police station. The report made by the Accused dated 4 December 2017 was admitted and marked as “D7”. Both in court and in D7, Accused denied that she had assaulted Kim as described by Kim.

### Defence’s Submissions

57     The Defence submits that the Prosecution has failed to prove the charges against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt for, _inter alia_, the following reasons:

> (a)     Kim’s allegations with respect to all the charges were ultimately wholly uncorroborated. No witness testified at trial to support Kim’s claim of abuse by the Accused. There were further no documentary evidence, such as text or WhatsApp messages from Kim to her relatives or friends, to support her claim that she had previously complained about being assaulted by the Accused over an extended period of time;

> (b)     Kim’s evidence, which was the main evidence relied upon by the Prosecution to prove its case was, for a large part, illogical, inherently credible, filled with gaps, and could not be safely relied upon to found a conviction.

> (c)     Kim further had a motive for fabricating the claim against the Accused. The Defence argued that the evidence showed that after Kim’s flight ticket for 21 December 2017 had been booked, Kim requested to leave Singapore earlier as she wanted to meet her uncle’s son after learning that he had already returned to Myanmar. When the Accused did not accede to her request, Kim then fabricated these allegations in a bid to return home immediately rather than having to wait until 21 December 2017.

## My decision

58     At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the Prosecution has not proven its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. I accordingly acquitted the Accused of all the charges. As the Prosecution has filed an appeal against my decision, I set out the grounds of my decision below.

### Applicable legal principles

59     In deciding this case, I am guided by the principles laid down in _Public Prosecutor v CGK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (Court of Appeal) (“_GCK_”), in particular, when examining whether the Prosecution has proven its case against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. The principles in _GCK’s_ case are especially pertinent as the evidence in the present case comprised, in the main, the Victim’s words against the Accused’s words. Against this backdrop, in normal legal parlance, the Prosecution’s evidence must be _unusually compelling_ to secure a conviction: see _GCK_ at \[143\].

60     As noted in _GCK’s_ case, a reasonable doubt can either arise from: (a) within the case mounted by the Prosecution (i.e. based on a consideration of all the evidence adduced by the Prosecution: at \[134\]); or (b) a totality of the evidence (i.e. by considering _all_ the evidence including the Defence’s case: at \[135\]). The “unusually convincing” standard sets the threshold for a witness’s testimony to be preferred over the evidence put forth by the accused person where it is a case of one person’s word against another’s. The assessment must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence. Whether an eyewitness’s uncorroborated evidence is unusually convincing requires an assessment of the internal and external consistencies of the eyewitness’s account, and of any other evidence that the court is bound to consider, which includes the Defence’s case and the evidence adduced by the accused person” \[at 149\].

### Analysis of the Evidence

61     Having reviewed the evidence, I found that there were various doubts arising from Kim’s version of the events, and the other evidence adduced at trial. Consequently, the Prosecution’s case did not meet the “unusually convincing” standard.

#### Claims of prior complaints of abuse not borne out by the evidence

62     First, Kim’s testimony was that she had previously mentioned the incidents of assault to various persons, including (i) DW2 Kelly Leong of Budget Maid; (ii) Shalynn of Budget Maid; (iii) Esther of Budget Maid; (iv) Tuan Sui Mawi (“**Tuan**”), her cousin; (v) DW4 Yueh Wan; and (iii) DW5 Yueh Xin. It was further not disputed that Kim was given significant liberty to, among other things: (a) use the home telephone; (b) leave the flat; (c) use her handphone to make calls, surf the net and/or chat on online platforms with her cousins or friends (after her handphone was returned to her around July 2017), and (d) meet up with her cousins and attend church once a month (from July 2017 onwards). Despite the significant opportunities and freedom afforded to Kim to interact with people outside of the Accused’s household, which Kim availed herself of, her allegations of assault were ultimately not corroborated by any independent witnesses or documentary evidence (such as text and other online messages with her friends or relatives).

63     Prosecution adduced ICA records to show that Esther and Tuan have since left Singapore: see Exhibit D8 and D9. However, it was not disputed that Shalynn is still with Budget Maid. Kim testified at trial that she had, at the work permit briefing of 1 August 2016, mentioned to Shalynn that she was hit by the Accused[^5]. Prosecution, however, made no attempts to call Shalynn as a witness. Indeed, the only independent witness who testified on this issue – namely, DW2 Kelly Leong – stated that, to the best of her recollection, Kim did not mention to her at any time that she was assaulted by the Accused[^6]. Kim did not mention this at the briefing of 1 August 2016, nor during any of the calls Kim had with Esther. According to DW2 Kelly Leong, any calls between Kim and Esther would have been arranged on a “three-party basis” based on the agency’s protocol, i.e. a Bukit Timah Budget Maid staff would also join the call between Esther and Kim and would be privy to the discussions. The reason for this was because Esther was not a formal employee of Bukit Timah Budget Maid. Thus, if Kim had complained to Esther about the abuse during one of their telephone calls, the agency would have known of such fact.

#### Inferences drawn from Kim continued employment with the Accused after Chinese New Year 2017

64     The fact that Kim continued to work with the Accused after the 2017 Chinese New Year incident, approximately seven months after Kim started work with the Accused, also raised doubts in my mind as to whether Kim had in fact been assaulted by the Accused around CNY 2017.

65     Kim’s testimony was that after the Second Incident (which allegedly occurred in end July 2016), she had already told Esther that she wanted a change of employer. Further, by the time of the Third Incident in October 2016, Kim had made up her mind to return to Myanmar. She testified she “_could not take it any longer_”[^7]. When Kim spoke to Esther who turned out to be completely apathetic, Kim claimed her decision then was to work for the Accused for six months to repay the agency loan, and thereafter, for one more month, in order to purchase a return ticket home[^8].

66     By the time of CNY 2017, Kim would have worked for Accused for approximately seven months. Despite her professed plans, when she was further allegedly assaulted again around CNY 2017, Kim did not proceed with her plan to return to Myanmar, nor seek a change of employer. This was despite Kim having already paid back her Agency loan in full by then. Prosecution argued that this could not be taken against Kim as she wanted to save more money; in any event, she did not think she would be working with the Accused for much longer. However, the objective fact was that Kim did eventually stay on for a further 11 months, a very substantial period considering that Kim had already indicated, within two weeks of starting work, and by her own testimony on several occasions thereafter (when she was allegedly slapped by the Accused), that she wanted to go home, or at the very least, seek a change of employer. Viewed in this light, Kim’s assertion that she had been assaulted by the Accused around CNY 2017 – and indeed in her own words, _on average, once a week_[^9] – was hardly convincing.

#### Inconsistencies between Kim’s account of the 4 December 2017 assault and the medical evidence

67     Kim’s account of how she was assaulted on 4 December 2017 was also inconsistent with the medical evidence before the court in two aspects. First, the medical report tendered in court, which contained a _contemporaneous_ account of the alleged assault on 4 December 2017 as narrated by Kim to the examining doctor, documented Kim as saying she had been “slapped on the _right side_ of her face and jabbed with the finger at the right eye region”[^10]. This was inconsistent with her account in court, where she claimed the Accused slapped _both_ her _left and right_ cheeks with both her hands four to five times[^11].

68     While there could have been some communication difficulties between PW3 Dr Arciaga and Kim, this should not be overstated. Communication by non-verbal means (e.g. via hand gestures) could easily (and was further likely to) have been resorted to if PW3 Dr Arciaga had difficulties understanding Kim. PW2 IO Eunice, for instance, testified that when she took Kim’s statement on the night of 4 December 2017, Kim had demonstrated the assault by using hand gestures[^12]. DW2 Kelly Leong also testified that when Kim visited the maid agency after running away, Kim similarly described the manner she was assaulted by using hand gestures[^13].

69     Secondly, even after making allowances for communication lapses between Kim and PW3 Dr Arciaga due to language issues, the actual medical injuries noted by the doctor in his medical report also did not support Kim’s account. The doctor noted that erythema (i.e. redness) was only observed over the _right_ zygomatic area of her face (and not the left): see Exhibit P7. While it was possible that the slaps over the left cheeks were comparatively lighter and thus did not cause redness, it was equally possible that she had in fact not been assaulted by the Accused in the manner described.

#### Logical problems with Kim’s account of her reaction when assaulted by the Accused.

70     Kim’s account of her reaction when she was slapped repeatedly on her cheeks and jabbed repeatedly on her right eye by the Accused also troubled me. According to Kim, she just “stood there”[^14] when the Accused slapped her _and repeatedly poked her eye_. She did not try to run away, nor take any evasive action to avoid being poked in her eye further[^15]. She claimed she reacted thus as the Accused was very angry, and would follow her even if she ran away[^16]. She just stood there and cried[^17].

71     I found this account rather incredible given that Kim was not someone who came across as being a timid and passive person, or who was slow to protest when she felt she was being unfairly treated. By her own testimony, when she was allegedly slapped approximately one week after starting work, she told the Accused that she wanted a change of employer. She further testified that on 1 August 2016, when she went to the Budget Maid office for the work permit briefing, she complained about being assaulted by the Accused to Esther, Shalynn and DW2 Kelly Leong. And when the Third incident happened in October 2016, she had, by her own account, asked the Accused to bring her back to the Agency, and told the Accused she would “call the police or MOM” [^18] if the Accused did not do so. Kim’s protestations on all these occasion suggested to me she was not a timid and fearful person, who was slow to assert her rights. Her contention that she would just stand still and allow the Accused to poke her eye, a vulnerable part of her body, repeatedly, without taking any evasive action whatsoever, simply had a hollow ring about it.

72     Kim’s follow-up account of how the events unfolded - in particular, her account that the Accused’s two daughters were at home in their rooms at the time, but never came out of their rooms and therefore did not witness the assault – was also confounding. Kim described this as her “worst” beating[^19] – she cried when she was first slapped, and cried even more[^20] when Accused slapped her and poked her right eye repeatedly. Yet by her own account, neither of the Accused’s two daughters heard the commotion, and none came out of their rooms to see what was happening[^21].

#### Doubts surrounding Kim’s accounts of what she did before travelling to Causeway Point

73     Also troubling, in my mind, was Kim’s inability to satisfactorily account for what she did on 4 December 2017 during the two-hour time gap from the time she was allegedly assaulted (i.e. between 11 am and 12 noon) and 2.14 pm, when she boarded the bus headed for Causeway Point[^22], as indicated in the ez-link travel record. When questioned, Kim agreed that she boarded the buses at the times indicated in ez-link travel record adduced as Exhibit D2[^23]. When asked why she left the house after the 4 December 2017 incident, Kim’s reply was that she “dared not stay in the house anymore” because she was “hit multiple times”[^24]. She further claimed the Accused had gone out shortly after the incident, but she did not know where the Accused had gone to[^25]. By implication therefore, Kim did not know when the Accused would return. Despite allegedly being afraid, Kim remained at home for approximately two hours, completing household chores assigned to her by the Accused[^26]. This, in my mind, did not comport with Kim’s claim that she was very fearful after being severely beaten by the Accused and felt she had to escape from her employer. It might be contended that Kim was in a confused or undecided state at that point in time and therefore did not leave immediately. However, this was _not_ her response when specifically asked by Defence Counsel to explain the two-hour time gap. Kim’s explanation, when asked, was that she remained at the flat as it was her “_habit_” to continue doing the work given to her “even if she were slapped or crying”[^27]. This is hardly convincing, especially given that Accused could return home at any time. It was also curious that Kim would take the house keys with her when she eventually left, which cast doubts, in my mind, as to what her real intentions were when she left the house at around 2.00 pm.

#### Doubts surrounding Kim’s reason for travelling to Causeway Point

74     I also found her explanation that she went to Causeway Point to look for the Woodlands branch of Budget Maid to be contrived. It was not disputed that Kim had full use of the house telephone, and that the telephone numbers of the maid agency, MOM and police, among others, were all pasted on the wall. If Kim were really minded to look for the location of a Budget Maid office (be it Woodlands or Bukit Timah branch), it was always open for her to call the maid agency to ask for directions, instead of hazarding a trip to Causeway Point to search blindly for the Woodlands branch of Budget Maid, where she has never been to before. Her story might have been more believable if she had escaped from the flat in a hurry to avoid the Accused. But that was not the case here. Kim admitted to remaining in the flat for some two hours or so to complete household chores. She had ample time to figure out what she wanted to do next. The fact that she chose to go to Causeway Point when there were other more practical options to seek help - e.g. call Budget Maid to ask for directions, call the police, MOM, etc. - raised significant questions in my mind as to why she went to Causeway Point in the first place.

### Motive to Fabricate

75     The Defence’s case was that Kim had requested to go home earlier after her ticket was booked on 27 November 2017, but her request was rejected by the Accused and her son. She thus concocted the story of being assaulted by the Accused with the hope that that would somehow facilitate her earlier departure. She also made up other instances of assault to render her allegations more believable[^28].

76     It is trite law that an accused person seeking to show that the victim has a motive to falsely implicate him or her has to adduce sufficient evidence of this motive so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the Prosecution’s case. A mere allegation is not sufficient: see _Ang Lilian v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 4 SLR 1072</span> (“_Ang Lilian_”) at \[48\]. Having reviewed the evidence as a whole, I found that the Defence has raised a sufficient basis for inferring a possible motive on Kim’s part to run away and lodge a false complaint against the Accused. I considered the following.

77     First, the Accused’s testimony was that Kim kept wanting to change her departure date after the date had been mutually agreed. The Accused’s contention was corroborated by DW2 Kelly Leong, an independent witness. DW2 Kelly Leong testified that the Accused had specifically requested her to speak with Kim as Kim “_kept repeatedly \[wanting\] to change the air ticket”_ after the departure date had been discussed and agreed with the Accused[^29]. According to Kelly, she proceeded to speak to Kim before the ticket was issued to confirm the departure date so that the Accused could proceed to purchase the air tickets. This was very shortly (approximately one to two days) before Kim went to the police on 4 December 2017[^30].

78     In my mind, Kim’s propensity to request repeated changes to her departure date after it has been agreed rendered it probable that Kim had changed her mind yet again after the ticket was purchased on 27 November 2017. This was in effect the Accused’s testimony in court, which was consistent with the Accused’s contemporaneous account as contained in the long statement recorded on 11 December 2017[^31], as well as the Accused’s update to DW2 Kelly Leong shortly after Kim had run away[^32].

79     Secondly, that Kim had a motive to make false claims against the Accused was also rendered probable by the fact that she had good reasons for wanting to go back earlier, namely, to spend more time with her Uncle’s son who was already back in Myanmar at the material time. Kim admitted that: (i) she was close to her uncle’s son[^33]; (ii) her uncle’s son had already been back in Myanmar for two to three weeks prior to 29 November 2017; and (iii) he would be leaving Myanmar on New Year’s day again for work[^34]. Against this backdrop, there was again a distinct possibility that Kim had second thoughts about the 21 December 2017 departure date after the ticket was purchased. When her request to bring forward her departure date was not acceded to by the Accused and her son, it was probable that Kim may have decided to run away and fabricate complaints of assault by the Accused, with the hope that this might cause Accused to accede to her request to change her departure date.

### Disproving the motive to fabricate

80     Where the defence has raised sufficient evidence of a motive to fabricate, the Prosecution bears the burden of proving that there was a lack of motive to fabricate beyond reasonable doubt – see _Ang Lilian;_ and _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ \[2019\] 3 SLR 349 at \[44 -48\].

81     Prosecution argued that Kim could not have had the motive to fabricate the claims against the Accused as:

> (a)     Kim was barely three weeks away from returning to Myanmar. There was no reason for her to allege that she was a victim of maid abuse and risk delaying her return to Myanmar due to the ensuing investigations, unless the Accused’s vicious assault on 4 December 2017 truly happened;

> (b)     The Accused, by her own testimony, did not reject Kim’s request to go home early outright. The Accused claimed she told Kim she would check with the agent whether the cancellation of the work permit could be processed earlier, and if so, to arrange for an earlier return date for Kim. Prosecution argued that if what the Accused said was true, there was simply no reason for Kim to take things into her own hands and fabricate the claims; and

> (c)     it was incredible for Kim to have self-inflicted an injury over a vulnerable part of her body, namely her right eye, just to procure an earlier return date.

#### Alleged illogicality of Kim jeopardising her return by fabricating maid abuse claims

82     Analyzing each of the Prosecution’s submissions in turn. As regards the contention that Kim would not have risked her prospects of going home in three weeks’ time unless she was truly severely assaulted by Accused on 4 December 2017, the fact that Kim was scheduled to return to Myanmar imminently was, in my view, at best a neutral factor. The converse hypothesis – namely, that it was more logically probable for someone in Kim’s position who was returning to Myanmar imminently to not want to blow up the matter and complicate her departure, especially having regard to the comparatively minor injuries she suffered (see \[87\] below), unless she had an ulterior purpose for doing so – was equally plausible.

83     Further, the evidence suggested to me that Kim took _very calculated steps_ when planning her move on 4 December 2017 so as to minimize the risks of her being held up by police investigations in Singapore. Kim could have easily lodged a complaint with MOM or the police by calling the relevant agencies from the house phone if the assault on 4 December 2017 did indeed take place and caused her so much fear that she could not stay at the flat any longer. She agreed that the telephone numbers of the agencies were pasted on the wall of the flat. Instead, by her own account, she chose the considerably more difficult option of going to Causeway Point to blindly look for the Woodlands branch of Budget Maid, where she had never been to before. When she could not locate the Budget Maid office at Causeway Point, instead of seeking directions to a nearby police station which would have been objectively easier, she chose to make a trip to Peninsula Plaza in a determined attempt to seek help to locate a Budget Maid office. The fact that she never attempted to contact the authorities, whether MOM or the police, on her own accord suggested to me Kim was mindful in ensuring that the steps she took would not jeopardize her imminent return to Myanmar.

84     Further, even when Kim went to Peninsula Plaza, her testimony was that she intended to look for a friend who would “_help … send me to the agency_”[^35]. Her “friend” (clarified subsequently to be a stranger she met at Peninsula Plaza), however, brought her to the HOME office in Peninsula Plaza instead. Yet again, it was clear from Kim’s evidence that she had always intended to seek help from Budget Maid _only_, and _not_ from the authorities. The air ticket had afterall been bought, and she had seen a copy of it – all she needed to do was to get Accused to bring forward the date, while avoiding being embroiled in any police investigations. Hence, Kim at all times sought to reach out to the maid agency only, and not the authorities. Alas, she was brought by the “friend” to the HOME office, which then referred her to the police given her claim of maid abuse.

#### Accused’s alleged willingness to expedite the work permit cancellation, thus negativing motive to fabricate

85     Prosecution made much of the Accused’s alleged offer to check if Kim’s work permit could be cancelled earlier and, if so, to arrange for an earlier flight for her. According to the Prosecution, if this were true, there was simply no reason for Kim to fabricate false claims against the Accused.

86     In my mind, the Accused’s representation to Kim that she would check if an earlier departure date could be arranged did not remove all possible motivations for Kim to take steps of her own to improve her chances of going back earlier. Indeed, Accused was non-committal about whether an earlier cancellation of the work permit would materialize. Accused stated to Kim that this was subject to her checking with Budget Maid on how soon the work permit cancellation could be processed[^36]. Accused had also previously communicated to Kim, DW3 Nicholas’ views that they should stick with the original date as any change in dates would incur substantial fees[^37]. The Accused had at no time promised or guaranteed to Kim that she could _definitely_ go back earlier. Viewed in this light, an allegation of maid abuse would still improve Kim’s chances of returning to Myanmar earlier, as it would incentivize the Accused, as well as Budget Maid, to expedite the Work Permit cancellation and bring forward the departure date, so as to avoid any undue complications for themselves.

#### Alleged illogicality of the self-injury theory

87     Lastly, the fact that Kim presented with an injury over her right preorbital region, a vulnerable part of her body, does not, in my opinion, completely eradicate a motive to fabricate the claims. As PW3 Dr Arciaga confirmed, Kim’s injury could be due to a host of possible reasons, including self-infliction. I noted that Kim’s injuries were in any event not very serious – there was no injury to the eye _per se_, and Kim was only dispensed with oral analgesic. While PW3 Dr Arciaga was understandably unwilling to opine definitively on the severity of Kim’s injury (since he did not review Kim subsequently), the evidence did not suggest that Kim needed more treatment than a prescription of paracetamol, and further to be taken only when needed.

88     The fact that there was a four to four-and-a-half hour time gap between the time the _Accused_ left the flat and the time Kim arrived at the HOME office, during which Kim’s activities could not be accounted for by any independent evidence apart from her own words, also gave rise to the possibility that Kim could have sustained the injury via other means or causes during this period. In short, the fact of Kim’s injury did not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the Accused must have inflicted the injury.

## Credibility of the witnesses

89     As the findings in the present case on whether a reasonable doubt has arisen rest considerably on the credibility of the victim vis-à-vis the Accused, it is necessary for this Court to form an assessment of the credibility of the victim and the Accused, and indeed of the other material witnesses in this trial.

90     In _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span>, the High Court held that the credibility of a witness may be assessed by reference to the following (at \[9\]):

> (a)     His demeanour.

> (b)     The internal consistency (or lack thereof) in the content of his evidence.

> (c)     The external consistency (or lack thereof) between the content of his evidence and extrinsic evidence (for example, the evidence of other witnesses, documentary evidence or exhibits).

91     When assessing the witnesses’ credibility (including those of the Kim and the Accused), some leeway should be given to inconsistencies as to their testimonies which can be properly regarded as minor and immaterial. As the High Court noted in _Ang Lilian_, “when a witness gives evidence on matters after a significant lapse of time, adequate allowance must be accorded to the human fallibility in retention and recollection” \[at 29\]. This is especially so in the present case as the alleged incidents occurred between two to three years before the commencement of the trial, such that it was reasonable that the witnesses’ memories of the events may have faded with the passage of time.

92     With these observations in mind, I turn to discuss my assessment of the credibility of the different witnesses.

### Kim

93     Kim stuck to a very simple story line. While I did not detect any problems with her demeanour, that was not surprising, given that Kim was not facing any charges.

#### Internal inconsistences, logical problems, and vacillations in Kim’s testimony

94     I was, however, troubled by numerous internal inconsistences, logical problems, and vacillations in relation to parts of Kim’s testimony, which I could not properly attribute to the fallibility of human memory. These included:

> (a)     Kim’s testimony was that she was slapped on more occasions than those referred to in the charges. In fact, at one point she claimed she was slapped “_on average … once a week_”[^38]. This contention appeared to me to be a gross exaggeration, and which sat very uncomfortably with her testimony that she otherwise found the Accused to be a “good” boss, whom she did not want to cause trouble for by reporting her to the authorities[^39].

> (b)     Kim’s reply, when asked by Prosecution how she _felt towards the Accused_ after the slapping and jabbing incident on 4 December 2017 was that she “_didn’t feel anything_ and just wanted to leave the house”[^40]. That she did not feel the slightest resentment towards the Accused for what, by her account, was a severe beating also defied belief;

> (c)     the apologetic tone and content of Kim’s WhatsApp message of 23 November 2017 (Exhibit D3), and her explanations for the same, also raised further doubts in my mind. The WhatsApp Message read as follows:

>> “Mum (sic) _I’m sorry for everything_, I give you a lot of problems I don’t want ready, really really I can’t work here I must need to go home ready sorry _I never think your family no good_, I can’t only”. _(emphasis added)_

> The content and apologetic tone of the WhatsApp message was, in my opinion, inconsistent with Kim’s claim that the Accused had resorted to violence against her on numerous occasions. It was further inconsistent with Kim’s story that she had told the Accused on various occasions in 2017 that she wanted to return home, and it was the Accused who specifically requested her to extend her stay for two further short periods until they had shifted to their new house, which Kim agreed to[^41]. If the latter were indeed true, there was no reason for Kim to be so apologetic when she sent the WhatsApp message of 23 November 2017 requesting to go home. The Accused’s family had by that time already moved to the new house, and Kim had already delayed her departure for two periods upon the Accused’s request. There was equally no reason for Accused to be surprised when she received the message, as evidenced by the two question marks Accused sent to Kim in reply: see Exhibit D3.

> (d)     when probed by the Defence Counsel as to why Kim made the statements in D3 in connection with her request to go home, Kim put forward a new explanation for requesting to go home. She mentioned for the first time the Accused had said Kim “always \[brought\] bad luck for the family”, such as causing the breakup of her eldest daughter and her boyfriend[^42]. Kim, therefore, asked Accused to “release her and let her go home”, as she did not want “to cause bad luck”[^43]. This was, however, inconsistent with her erstwhile cited reason for wanting to go home, namely, to spend time with her old and ailing grandparents[^44]. Kim’s testimony that Accused blamed Kim for “always bringing bad luck” to the family also defied logic – if that were indeed the Accused’s view, then why would Accused have wanted so much to persuade Kim to stay, as contended by Kim?

> (e)     Kim’s story that the Accused became extremely belligerent and repeatedly tried to find fault with her work after the air ticket was purchased also flies in the face of the Accused’s objective actions after Kim communicated her wish to return to Myanmar. It was not disputed that on 27 November 2017, the Accused brought Kim out for shopping and purchased a bag for her. They even posed for a shot together in good spirits (Exhibit D4). When Kim communicated that she did not wish to stay on any longer at the 27 November 2017 outing, the Accused arranged for a ticket to be purchased for Kim _that very night and showed it to Kim_. The return date was further scheduled for 21 December 2017, less than a month later, to accommodate Kim’s wishes to return home before Christmas. All these were not disputed by Kim. By all accounts, the Accused was highly accommodative towards Kim’s request to return home early, even though it was Kim who wanted to terminate her contract prematurely. Accused proceeded to make arrangements expeditiously for Kim’s return, with a return date set at _less than a month_ after Kim first made the request in writing via the 23 November 2017 WhatsApp message. Kim’s story that despite being so accommodative to her, the Accused would suddenly bear a grudge against Kim for wanting to return home and proceed to find fault with Kim at every available opportunity just did not make sense. There was simply no need to be so accommodative to Kim if the Accused was so displeased with Kim’s decision to begin with.

### The Accused

95     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused showed herself to be evasive and defensive on the stand. The Accused had to be repeatedly reminded to answer questions directly and consistently volunteered irrelevant information in her answers.

96     I disagreed. The Accused did come across as being rather timid and pedantic when answering questions posed to her, both during Examination in Chief and Cross-Examination. I did not, however, interpret this as pointing to an overall lack of credibility. Here timidity was, in my assessment, a function of her age, and her first involvement in a criminal trial. Her pedantic approach, on the other hand, seemed to have been borne out of her extremely cautious personality, her deep-seated concerns about leaving out material details which may then lead to inaccurate or imprecise answers being communicated, her timid nature, as well as her comparatively low educational standard (it was not disputed that her occupation was a factory production operation). While the Accused had completed a part time diploma offered by the PSB Academy, her lack of proficiency in the English language, and inability to understand complex questions posed to her, was evident throughout the trial. Not only did the Accused testify in Mandarin at trial, it appeared that all her police statements recorded from the start of the investigations in 2017 were recorded in Mandarin. Indeed, PW2 IO Eunice similarly opined, when recording the Accused’s statements, that the Accused came across as “_a bit timid…. \[but\] quite sincere in offering … information_”[^45]. On the whole, I did not construe her eagerness to understand the question fully, and to provide a very accurate and comprehensive response, as suggestive of her evasiveness.

#### Analysis of inconsistencies in Accused’s evidence

97     I, however, accepted that there were some inconsistencies between the Accused’s evidence in court and the extrinsic evidence, as pointed out by the Prosecution.

#### Accused’s previous complaints to Budget Maid about Kim

98     First, Prosecution submitted that Accused had maintained in court that she never complained to Budget Maid about Kim’s work. This was, however, contradicted by DW2 Kelly Leong, who testified that Accused had complained to Budget Maid about her dissatisfaction with Kim’s work performance previously.

99     Even if I were to accept DW2 Kelly Leong’s testimony (which I did), I did not think the Accused’s assertion that she had never complained to Budget Maid about Kim before amounted to a _Lucas_ lie as expounded in _Regina v Lucas (Ruth)_ <span class="citation">\[1981\] QB 720</span>. For one, the complaints about Kim happened some two to three years ago - Accused may not have remembered all of these complaints due to the passage of time, especially if the complaints pertained to relatively trivial matters such as inability to cook. Further, DW2 Kelly Leong’s testimony was that any complaint was confined to the _first three months of Kim’s employment_, and that thereafter, the complaints stopped as the Accused had found Kim “very obedient already”[^46]. In any case, the evidence did not suggest that the Accused had ever sought a change of maids due to her dissatisfaction with Kim. Her approach was merely to ask the agency to “counsel” Kim[^47]. The evidence, viewed holistically, did not suggest that Accused was extremely displeased with Kim’s work.

100    In any event, it is trite law that the accused person’s lie can only amount to a corroboration of guilt under certain prescribed conditions, one of which is that the lie must relate to a material issue. Here, the issue of whether the Accused did in fact complain about Kim’s performance to the agency previously could not be said to relate to a material issue, having regard to the charges preferred against the Accused: see _Muhammad Nabill bin Mohd Faud v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 984</span> at \[86\].

#### Variances between P13 and the Accused’s testimony in court

101    Prosecution next pointed out that there were a number of variances between the Accused’s long statement (Exhibit P13) and her testimony in court. These variances were summarized in the Prosecutions’ Closing Submissions as follows[^48]:

102    While I noted these inconsistencies, I was of the view that they did not pertain to material details that affected the core of the Accused’s defence. Nor did I think the inconsistencies between P13 and the Accused’s in-court testimony undermined the Accused’s credibility for the reasons noted below.

#### Allowance for human fallibility in recollection with passage of time

103    First, the discrepancies related to the Accused’s recollection of details or the precise sequence of events which happened two to three years ago, for which some allowance must be given for “human fallibility in retention or recollection”: see _Ang Lilian_ at \[29\]. Despite these variances, none of the statements contained any admission, whether direct or indirect, of the Accused’s guilt. Viewed as a whole, they did not detract significantly from the Accused’s account of the key events in court, and did not contradict the Accused’s consistent position that she did not in any way assault Kim on each of the occasions.

104    Dealing with each discrepancy in turn:

> (a)     In relation to the CNY 2017 Incident, whether the Accused had seen Kim crying in the house and asked her what had happened before Kim left the house, or whether the Accused had in fact expressly told Kim to “go out first”, all did not detract from the Accused’s account that Kim went missing that night and the Accused and her daughter had to search the surrounding area for Kim. Any imprecision in the Accused’s account of what was exactly said between the Accused and Kim that night, as well as the sequence in which they were said, are explicable when one considers the fallibility of human recollection of details occasioned by the passage of time. This was particularly so as the Accused was by her own account busy with various household tasks that night.

> (b)     Again when Kim was found, whether the Accused did in fact _question_ her on why she left the house at all, and _explain_ to Kim what the Accused meant when she said “go out first”, were again inconsequential and minute details that a reasonable person could not reasonably be expected to remember with detailed precision after two to three years.

> (c)     Turning to the issue of whether Kim had made a few requests to return to Myanmar beginning in 2017, or whether Kim made the request for the _first time_ on 23 November 2017, again, I did not think this pertained to a material detail that affected the Accused’s credibility. The Accused could not reasonably be expected to recall in precise detail all the verbal requests made by Kim to return home in the course of 2017, and exactly when they were made. The undisputed fact is that Kim did make a request in writing on 23 November 2017, which request was acceded to by the Accused, which led to the purchase of the air ticket on 27 November 2017, and culminated in Kim eventually running away on 4 December 2017.

> (d)     On the issue of the Accused’s exact response when Kim requested to return to Myanmar earlier, again I fail to see the usefulness of dissecting what the Accused actually said. The fluidity of human conversations suggests that different scenarios may have been canvassed at different stages of the conversation. Positions are susceptible to change and concessions may be made upon further discussions. The Accused could very well have been reluctant in the beginning, but then decided to give in to Kim’s pleas. Some latitude must be accorded to the Accused if she could not remember or omitted to recount the full details of her communications with Kim and/or how these discussions evolved. What was, however, consistent throughout was that Accused acceded to Kim’s request to return to Myanmar before the expiry of her contract, booked a ticket with a departure date of 21 December 2017, and expressed reservations when Kim requested to change the return date to an earlier date.

#### Copy of Exhibit P13 only given to Accused mid-way during trial

105    Secondly, the absence of a complete symmetry between what the Accused stated in P13 and what she testified in court must also be appreciated against the backdrop that a copy of P13 was _never_ given to the Accused before the trial. The Accused and her counsel were given a copy of P13 for the first time mid-way during the trial. The Accused’s testimony was that whenever she needed to recollect past events, she would check the records stored in her handphone[^49]. The differences between Accused’s account in P13 and in-court testimony could therefore reasonably be attributed to imperfections in her recollection of events that happened two to three years ago. And as mentioned above, the discrepancies further related to precise sequence of events, and/or the precise words uttered (or not uttered). Some variances that did not go to the heart of the dispute must necessarily be expected. What was critical, in my view, was that the Accused’s in-court testimony and P13 matched in material respects, especially in relation to the key events in P13 mentioned by the Accused to have taken place. The Accused’s account in court and P13 matched in large parts despite the fact that the Accused never had sight of P13 until midway through the trial.

106    Prosecution made much of the fact that the Accused and her son had never raised any issues about the process of recording, or the accuracy, of P13 until the trial. This was in contradistinction with the Accused’s cautioned statement for the First Charge (Exhibit D14), which DW3 Nicholas had demanded that PW2 IO Eunice rectify to accurately reflect Kim’s scheduled departure date. Prosecution submits that this implied that the Accused never had any issues with the accuracy of P13. The fallacy of this argument is, however, immediately apparent once one appreciates that the Accused was never extended a copy of P13 until mid-way through the trial. There were therefore no means by which the Accused and/or DW3 Nicholas could have detected any inaccuracies in P13 earlier, much less challenge them, even if they wanted to.

#### Possible inaccuracies introduced during recording of P13

107    Thirdly, the inconsistencies noted between P13 and the Accused’s testimony in court could further be attributed to inaccuracies in translation which were introduced during the statement recording process. It was not disputed that the Accused had given her statement in Mandarin, which was then translated and recorded by PW2 IO Eunice in English. While I accepted PW2 IO Eunice’s testimony that P13 was voluntarily made, and that she had interpreted the Accused’s statements word for word to her _when typing out the statement into her laptop_, PW2 IO Eunice was candid in stating that _after the final statement was printed out_, it was interpreted to the Accused “_at a faster speed_” to give her a “_rough idea_” of the final statement. This, according to PW2 IO Eunice, was sufficient because the statement had already been interpreted once before[^50].

108    In my mind, the process by which PW2 IO Eunice translated and recorded the Accused’s long statement – i.e. with PW2 IO Eunice first listening to the Accused’s testimony in Mandarin by individual sentences, then typing each sentence into her laptop in English, and thereafter interpreting the typed sentence back to the Accused in Mandarin, before repeating the same process for the next sentence[^51] – introduces risks of translation inaccuracies, especially given the pauses which would have been necessitated in between the translation and recording of consecutive sentences. Any inaccuracies in the interrelationship between different sentences may not be apparent to the deponent of the statement when sentences are recorded and translated individually in this manner. In my mind, what would have been necessary to ensure the accuracy of the final recorded statement was for PW2 IO Eunice to have reinterpreted the _final_ printed statement back to the Accused again in detail, sentence by sentence, to ensure that the statement as a whole accurately captured what the Accused meant to convey. However, by PW2 IO Eunice’s own testimony, after the statement was fully recorded and printed, she went through it with the Accused “_at a faster speed_” so as to give her a “_rough idea_” of the final statement[^52]. Viewed in this light, it was possible that that the Accused may not have picked up all the inaccuracies in the final version of P13 as recorded by PW2 IO Eunice, which was the Accused’s contention in court.

109    As noted above, having observed the Accused over the trial, I believed the Accused had limited proficiency in the English language. She conceded she was able to speak very simple English; however, it was evident she had significant difficulties understanding the questions posed to her during her examination, even with translation. Notwithstanding the fact she had obtained a part time diploma offered by PSB Academy, she testified that she was only able to complete her readings and assignments with the help of her classmates. Notably, all her statements tendered in court, including those made the Neighborhood Police Post, were given in Mandarin and translated by the recording officer.

110    Having regard to all these factors, I am of the view that the inconsistencies highlighted by the Prosecution in relation to P13 may further be attributed to the inaccuracies which had been introduced through the translation process.

### DW2 Kelly Leong

111    In making my findings of fact and drawing the relevant inferences, I ascribed significant weight to DW2 Kelly Leong’s testimony. I found DW2 Kelly Leong to be a balanced and credible witness. She never sought indiscriminately to paint the Accused in positive light. She was candid that the Accused was a demanding client and had expressed unhappiness at their office openly before. She mentioned that Accused had on one occasion, within the first three months’ of Kim starting work, brought Kim to the maid agency and complained about Kim’s performance in a very loud voice, and that three of the staff had to ask her to “cool down”[^53]. Further, where DW2 Kelly Leong was unable to testify positively about certain facts, she stated so candidly. When pressed by the prosecution on the _possibility_ of certain scenarios which were not in the Accused’s favor, DW2 Kelly Leong readily conceded.

112    Overall, I found DW2 Kelly Leong to be an impartial and independent witness, and assigned significant weight to her testimony, in particular, on the issues of whether Kim had previously complained of abuse by the Accused (see paragraph 63 above), as well as the circumstances leading up to Kim’s planned return to Myanmar (see paragraph 77 above). On these two issues, DW2 Kelly Leong’s testimony was more corroborative of the Accused’s account.

### DW3 Nicholas

113    Prosecution submitted that the evidence of the Accused’s children should be treated with caution given their relationship with the Accused. Prosecution further contended that they were persistently evasive and had to be repeatedly reminded to answer the questions posed to them directly. They also showed themselves to be unreliable witnesses in the course of their evidence.

114    Specifically, in relation to DW3 Nicholas, Prosecution argued that DW3 Nicholas’s partiality as a witness was most evident from the ruckus he kicked up at the Bedok police station on 14 August 2018 when he requested PW2 IO Eunice to correct an error in the Accused’s cautioned statement (Exhibit D14) pertaining to Kim’s planned departure date. PW2 IO Eunice had refused to amend the cautioned statement after it had been recorded, in line with the police procedures. She, however, agreed to reflect the correct date by way of a further statement which was then duly recorded (Exhibit P16).When PW2 IO Eunice refused DW3 Nicholas’s request to check this further statement, he shouted loudly at PW2 IO Eunice publicly, and asked to see PW2 IO Eunice’s supervising officer, PW5 ASP Quek. PW5 ASP Quek subsequently permitted DW3 Nicholas to read P16. Prosecution suggested that DW3 Nicholas’ conduct was nothing but a blatant attempt to corroborate the Accused’s claim that PW2 IO Eunice must have likewise failed to record P13 (the Accused’s long statement) accurately.

115    With respect, I am unable to follow this argument. The Defence’s explanation as to why DW3 Nicholas did raise any issues about the accuracy of P13 was simply because a copy of P13 was never extended to the Accused prior to trial. DW3 Nicholas and the Accused were therefore in no position to verify if P13 were accurately recorded or translated. There was no need for DW3 Nicholas to go through such a circuitous path just to challenge the accuracy of P13.

116    I would for completeness deal with DW3 Nicholas’ contention that his mother _might_ not have been given a copy of the cautioned statements, in breach of the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68, 2012 Red Ed) (“**CPC**”). I did not accept his contention. I should preface by stating that I found that PW2 IO Eunice did extend to the Accused a copy of the cautioned statements, and this was why DW3 Nicholas discovered that there was an inaccuracy in Kim’s departure date as recorded in D14. That said, I did not think DW3 Nicholas’ testimony that he was unsure if the cautioned statements were extended to the Accused undermined his credibility. It was evident during DW3’s testimony at trial that he did not fully appreciate the difference between the witness statements recorded from him, his siblings and his mother (collectively, the “**Witness Statements**”) (which makers thereof were not entitled to a copy of under the CPC), and the cautioned statements given by the Accused (which the Accused was entitled to a copy of under the CPC) [^54]. DW3 Nicholas was likely, in my assessment, to have assumed from the police’s refusal to extend him a copy of the Witness Statements that such refusal extended to copies of the Accused’s cautioned statements as well. Indeed, DW3 Nicholas did not state categorically that the Accused was refused a copy of her cautioned statement. Rather his testimony was that he was “unsure” as to whether the Accused was extended a copy of her cautioned statements initially, but that at any rate, by the time they left the police station, she had been given a copy[^55].

117    Viewed as a whole, I did not think DW3 presented himself as an obviously non-credible witness.

### DW4 Yueh Wan

118    Prosecution submitted that DW4 Yueh Wan was evasive on the stand which showed her lack of credit.

119    In particular, Prosecution submitted that she shifted her position when giving evidence on what occurred between the Accused and Kim around CNY 2017. DW4 Yueh Wan’s account of what happened during the CNY 2017 incident was largely corroborative of the Accused’s. DW4 Yueh Wan initially stated that the only conversation she heard between the Accused and Kim when they found Kim, was the Accused asking Kim “why are you out of the house”, and Kim replying “sorry”. DW4 Yueh Wan confirmed that she did not recall either the Accused or Kim saying anything else to each other. However, when asked later to explain why she had the belief that Kim left the house because she misunderstood the Accused’s direction to leave the room, DW4 Yueh Wan then testified that the Accused _may have_ said to Kim “I asked you to go out, not go out” (the “**Further Detail**”), though she claimed to be unsure of this. Prosecution submits that this change in position goes to show that DW4 Yueh Wan was not telling the truth about the events occurring around CNY 2017.

120    I am not persuaded by Prosecution’s argument. By the time DW4 Yueh Wan took the stand on 17 September 2020, more than three-and-a- half years have passed since the CNY Incident. DW4 Yueh Wan had further probably heard different accounts of the CNY Incident from the Accused, Kim and her family members. It would be unrealistic to expect DW4 Yueh Wan to remember the _exact_ words exchanged between the Accused and Kim that night. Some leeway must be given to fallibility in human recollection in this regard, especially as Prosecution was pressing for specific words said, and the exact sequence in which they were said. The Further Detail offered by DW4 Yueh Wan was further a response to a very specific series of questions asked of her during cross-examination. Even when DW4 Yueh Wan volunteered the Further Detail, she was quick to clarify that she was not very sure of this fact[^56]. Thus, the fact that DW4 Yueh Wan subsequently volunteered the Further Detail when pressed by the Prosecution should not, in my opinion, adversely impact her credibility.

121    In my assessment, DW4 Yueh Wan showed herself to be a composed witness who tried to answer the questions posed to her to the best of her ability while on the stand. Again, I am unable to agree with the Prosecution that, apart from her association with the Accused, DW4 Yueh Wan had shown herself to be a non-credible witness.

### DW5 Yueh Xin

122    With regards DW5 Yueh Xin, Prosecution claimed there was a material inconsistency in her evidence. Specifically, Prosecution pointed out that DW5 Yueh Xin had in her first statement to the police on 11 December 2017 (Exhibit P17), stated that ever since Kim got a phone back from the agent, _which was before October 2017_, Kim started telling the Accused she wanted to go home.According to the Prosecution, DW5 Yueh Xin contradicted this in her oral evidence in court when she stated that Kim had asked to return to Myanmar _only after_ the move to the Woodlands Rise flat _in November 2017_. Prosecution argued that this was a material inconsistency, and sought to impeach DW5 Yueh Xin’s credit.

123    It is evident that the Prosecution’s line of questioning focuses on two specific time-frames: (i) first, the time when Kim’s phone was returned to her, which was _before October 2017_; and (ii) next, the time the household moved to the Woodlands Rise flat, which was in _November 2017_. The two time frames were a mere _one-month apart_. I did not think any discrepancy in DW5 Yueh Xin’s recollection of whether Kim started to request to return home _before October 2017_ or _after November 2017_ was so material a detail that DW5 Yueh Xin would have a reason to lie about. It did not have a material bearing on the issues in dispute, namely whether the Accused had assaulted Kim on the various occasions alleged. Further, the manner in which the question was phrase required the witness to recall the exact time frames in which certain conversations took place some three years ago. Surely, some latitude must be given to imprecision in human recollection over time.

124    For all the reasons noted above, I did not find DW3 to DW5 to be non-credible witnesses. There were no significant discrepancies in their testimonies, save for minute details which did not go to the core of the Prosecution’s or Defence’s case. I am however mindful of their relationship with the Accused and therefore did not assign excessive weight to their testimonies. That said, as I did not find any critical issues with respect to their credibilities, it would also be inappropriate for me to disregard their testimonies completely.

## Conclusion

125    Having considered the evidence in its totality, I did not think the Prosecution’s case met the unusually compelling standard. In arriving at this conclusion, I considered the various reasonable doubts which have arisen from the evidence, including the following:

> (a)     The fact that there was no independent witness or evidence to corroborate Kim’s account of the assault despite the significant liberty accorded to her leave the house, to use telecommunication devices to chat with her relatives and friends (including on online platforms), and to meet up physically with her cousins and friends. Despite her ample opportunities to interact socially, there was no oral or documentary record of her having complained to anyone about being assaulted by the Accused.

> (b)     The independent witness called at trial, DW2 Kelly Leong, testified that she does not recall Kim having ever complained about being abused by the Accused to the maid agency. The lack of complaints could not be attributed to DW2 Kelly Leong’s inability to understand the Chin dialect. Her testimony was that it was not uncommon for maids to complain about abuse using sign gestures if needed.

> (c)     The fact that Kim stayed for some 11 months post the Third Incident contradicted her expressed resolution, in the immediate aftermath of the Second Incident in October 2016, to return to Myanmar once she had repaid her agency loan, given the frequent beatings she claimed to have received from the Accused.

> (d)     There were also inconsistencies in Kim’s account of the manner in which she was assaulted by the Accused on 4 December 2017, and the medical report prepared by PW3 Dr Arciaga.

> (e)     Kim’s account that she took no evasive and/or defensive action at all when her eye, a vulnerable part of her body, was repeatedly poked by the Accused was also troubling. According to her, she just stood there and cried. Her claim was that despite her “crying harder” as she was being repeatedly assaulted, none of the Accused’s daughters heard the commotion and came out to see what had happened. All these sounded improbable to me.

> (f)     There was further an inherent tension between Kim’s claim that she was “afraid’ and “dared not” stay in the house any longer after the 4 December 2017 beating, and the fact that she remained at the flat for some two hours to complete household chores after the alleged beating. Her explanation that it was her “habit” to complete chores given to her, even when she was crying, was, in my mind, rather confounding.

> (g)     Kim’s decision to go to Causeway point to blindly look for the Woodlands branch of Budget Maid, where she has never been to before, was also curious. This is especially so as she could have easily telephoned Budget Maid and asked for directions before setting out as she had full access to the house phone and the telephone numbers of Budget Maid. Alternatively, she could have sought help from a nearby police post or MOM.

> (h)     The evidence also pointed to a possible motive on Kim’s part for fabricating allegations of the assault against the Accused, namely, to pressurize the Accused to bring forward her departure date. This was corroborated by DW2 Kelly Leong’s testimony, which confirmed the Accused’s claim that Kim had repeatedly changed her mind about her departure date after the date was discussed and agreed with the Accused.

126    The Prosecution rightly noted certain inconsistences in the Accused’s testimony in court vis-à-vis her long statement and other extrinsic evidence. However, as explained above, I found that these variances did not relate to material details, and/or could be attributed fallibility in the Accused’s memory of events that happened a long time ago, and/or could be due to inaccuracies in the recording of the long statement as a result of the translation process. In particular, while there were some variances between some of the details in P13 and the Accused’s in-court testimony, the key events mentioned by the Accused on both occasions matched to a large degree, despite the fact that the Accused was not given a copy of P13 until mid-way through the trial.

127    As I noted at the outset, the Prosecution’s case is essentially based on the “mutually exclusive and competing testimonies” of Kim and the Accused. Kim’s evidence therefore needs to be unusually convincing, “in the sense that it is sufficient in and of itself to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration”, to secure a conviction: see _Public Prosecutor v Wee Teong Boo and other appeal and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 2 SLR 533</span> at \[44\]. In light of the many reasonable doubts I have noted from the evidence, I am unable to conclude that the Prosecution’s case met the “unusually convincing” standard. Accordingly, I found that the Prosecution had not proven Accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt in relation to all the proceeded charges. It would be _unsafe_ to convict based on Kim’s testimony _alone_.

128    I have addressed the evidence in relation to all five charges collectively as the case in relation to all five charges ultimately boiled down to an assessment of the Kim’s words against the Accused’s words.

129    Based on my findings above, I therefore acquitted the Accused of all the charges preferred against her.
