2       Upon his conviction, the accused person admitted the remaining 7 charges and consented for them to be taken into consideration(TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. The 7 charges consist of 2 counts under section 6(3) of the POHA, 1 count under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act Cap 184, 2 counts of having drug taking utensils under section 9 of the MDA and 2 counts for failure to report for urine tests.

3       The accused was sentenced to serve a total of 7 years and 11 months’ imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. He is now appealing against his sentence.

## Statement of Facts(SOF)

4       The material portions of the SOF of the proceeded charges which the accused admitted without any qualification is as follows:

5       The accused is employed as a hawker at Tekka Market, Singapore.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC 931253/2018 and MAC 909098/2018

6       The victims are:

a.     Lee Hui Min, Female / 23 years old, a Police Officer with the Singapore Police Force(SPF) holding the rank of Assistant Superintendent (ASP), and who is a public servant (“Officer Lee”);

b.     Sean Teo, Male / 22 years old, a Police Officer with the SPF holding the rank of Sergeant, and who is a public servant (“Officer Sean”).

7       On 15 September 2017, at about 5:25am, the Complainant, one Mr Paulose Sijomon, called the Police Hotline, stating: “There is a fight and they are throwing the things around.” The incident location was given as being at 20 Circular Road, Singapore. Investigations revealed that the Accused had gone out with some friends, including one Hassan Mohamed (“Hassan”), the night before to drink alcoholic beverages. He drank significant amounts of alcohol and became drunk.

8       At about 5:25am on 15 September 2017, the Accused and Hassan went to the Shah Alam restaurant (“restaurant”) in the vicinity of 20 Circular Road, Singapore. Whilst there, the Accused went to a stock of onions belonging to the restaurant and urinated on the onions. This was seen by one of the restaurant’s staff, who tried to stop him. However, the Accused became upset, started flipping tables and throwing items inside the restaurant, prompting the Complainant, the manager of the restaurant, to call for the Police.

9       Police Officers arrived at the scene soon after. Officer Lee arrived together with her partner, SSGT Muhd Helmi. Upon assessing the scene, Officer Lee decided that more officers were required, and called for backup. Officer Sean and his partner, SC/SGT Muhd Alif, arrived soon after as backup.

10     Upon arrival, Officer Lee directed Officer Sean and SC/SGT Muhd Alif to detain the Accused and Hassan for investigation purposes, whilst Officer Lee and SSGT Muhd Helmi entered the restaurant to speak to the Complainant.

11     At about 5:45am, just as Officer Sean began to keep watch over the Accused and Hassan, the Accused went up to Officer Sean and hurled vulgarities at him, saying words like “useless police fuckers” and “you are just a fucking sergeant.” The Accused used these abusive words and behaviour on Officer Sean in the execution of his duty as a public servant.

12     Just as the Accused was hurling vulgarities at Officer Sean, Officer Lee and SSGT Muhd Helmi came out from the restaurant and approached them. Officer Lee stated her intention to conduct a search on him as there was some suspicion of him being in possession of a weapon. However, the Accused refused to cooperate, and spat his saliva at Officer Lee. Some of the Accused’s spittle landed at the corner of Officer Lee’s mouth. The Officers immediately cautioned the Accused to cease, but he was undeterred and threatened to spit at Officer Lee again. The Accused spat at Officer Lee with intent to deter her from discharging her duty as a public servant.

13     The Officers proceeded to place the Accused under arrest. At about 5:51am, the Accused used vulgarities on Officer Sean. Specifically, the Accused shouted “Fuck you, what the Fuck I do.” The Accused also shouted “Fuck your mother”, “Na Bei Chee Bye” and “Your mother Chee Bye”, which when translated into English, means “your mother’s cunt.” The Accused then pointed his middle finger at Officer Sean. Officer Sean warned him to stop, but the Accused then retorted with “what the fuck you giving warning.” A torrent of verbal abuse continued despite the Officers’ warnings.

14     Based on the foregoing, the Accused has committed 1 offence punishable under section 6(3) of the POHA Act, and 1 offence under section 353 of the Penal Code.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC 937423/2018, DAC 937424/2018, DAC 937429/2018 and DAC-928032-2018

15     On 29 June 2016, the Accused was placed under a Supervision Order (“Supervision Order”) pursuant to Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (“the Regulations”) for a period of 24 months from 22 July 2016 to 21 July 2018. However, he had not been turning up for his routine urine tests since 10 July 2017, and multiple visits were conducted at his registered residence, but he was unable to be found.

16     On 15 August 2018, at about 5:03pm, enforcement officers paid a further visit to his residence at Block 106A Canberra Street #02-410, Singapore. This time, the Accused was at home, but he refused to open the door. Forced entry was eventually effected and the Accused placed under arrest. The items recovered from the Accused’s residence included 1 straw containing crystalline substance and drug taking utensils

17     A further search of the Accused’s residence revealed the presence of additional weapons including swords and daggers.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC 937424/2018

18     The Accused was brought back to the Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigation. The 1 straw containing crystalline substance was sent to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for analysis. On 12 September 2018, Jesslyn Oh Su Yun, an Analyst from HSA issued one certificate under section 16 of the MDA stating that on analysis, the one straw containing not less than 0.03gram of crystalline substance was analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine.

19     Methamphetamine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the MDA. The Accused is not authorized to possess Methamphetamine and he has thus committed an offence under section 8(a), and punishable under section 33(1) of the said Act.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC 937423/2018

20     Whilst at the Police Divisional Headquarters, the Accused provided two bottles of his urine samples. On 16 August 2018, the said urine samples were sent to the HSA for analysis. On 20 August 2018, the HSA issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA by 2 analysts, namely Zhang Huifen Hannah and Kwok Yi Ling Miiko. Both certificates stated that upon analysis, the said urine samples were found to contain Monoacetylmorphine.

21     Monoacetylmorphine is a metabolite of diamorphine. In turn, diamorphine is an active ingredient of heroin. The Accused’s urine tested positive for Monoacetylmorphine because of his consumption of heroin.

22     The Accused has admitted to consuming heroin whilst alone in his living room. He claims that he receives his supply of heroin from a friend named “John”, who would give it to him for free. He would place some heroin on a piece of aluminum foil, then use a lighter to heat the bottom of the foil until smoke is produced. He claims that he abuses heroin to relax and to help him to sleep.

23     Monoacetylmorphine is a specified drug listed in the MDA. The Accused is not authorized to consume Monoacetylmorphine, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

24     Further, before the commission of this offence, the Accused was, on 3 April 2013 convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, nimetazepam, and was punished with 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. This conviction and sentence have not been set aside to-date, and the Accused is thereby liable to be punished under section 33A (2) of the MDA.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC 937429/2018

25     As stated above, the Accused failed to report for his regular urine tests since July 2017. On 17 July 2018, he failed to present himself for a urine test at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters as required under the said Supervision Order. The Accused neither has valid reasons, nor medical certificates, to explain his absence. Rather, he failed to report because he had relapsed into abusing drugs, and knew that he was wanted by the Police.

26     He has thereby committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Regulations, punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the Regulations.

#### Facts pertaining to DAC 928032-2018

27     A further search of the Accused’s residence revealed the presence of weapons namely 1 white samurai sword with a sheath attached, 1 black dagger with sheath and black string attached and 1 big sword with white handle with sheath attached. These weapons are scheduled weapons within the second schedule to the (CESOW Act). The accused had no lawful purpose for the possession of these weapons. He has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 7(1)(a) of the CESOW Act.

## The Sentence

29     In this case, the accused has been convicted of 6 charges. 3 of them are under the MDA. This set of 3 consists of 1 count of consumption of a specified drug, an LT2 charge, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane, 1count of possession of a Class A controlled drug where the prescribed punishment is imprisonment up to 10 years or a fine up to $20,000 or both and 1 count of failing to report for urine test where the punishment would be a fine up to $10,00 or imprisonment up to 4 years or both.

30     In respect of the 3 non- MDA offences, he has been convicted of 1 count of possession of scheduled weapons under section 7(1)(a) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons (CESOW) Act Cap 65, where the prescribed punishment is imprisonment which should not exceed 5 years with mandatory caning of 6 strokes of the cane. There is also 1 count of using criminal force on a public servant under section 353 of the Penal Code which is punishable with imprisonment up to 4 years or with a fine and 1 count under section 6(3) of the POHA, where the punishment is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment term not exceeding 12 months or both.

31     The prosecution, in their written address on sentence, citing a number of aggravating factors sought a global sentence of 7 years, 11 months imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. This would entail making 3 terms of imprisonment run consecutively and comprising the term of imprisonment of 7 years for the LT2 offence, a term of 9 months imprisonment for the failure to report for urine test and a term of imprisonment of 2 months for the section 353 offence of using criminal force on a public servant. In particular, the prosecution stressed the fact that the offences were committed while the accused was on court bail. The accused in his oral mitigation merely pleaded for leniency.

32     It would appear from the records that the accused was first charged in court on the 11 of April 2017 for 1 count of cheating under section 420 of the Penal Code and he was released on court bail on the 18 April, 2017. (He was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal for this cheating charge on the 20 September 2018.) From the schedule of the 13 offences he is currently facing, the accused had re-offended on the 15 September 2017,19 March 2018, 2 July 2018, 9 July 2018, 16 July 2018 and 15 August 2018. Committing offences while on court bail is definitely an aggravating factor. (See PP _v Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ ). As stated in the cases mentioned, it demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention.

33     The accused’s situation here is even more egregious. After he was bailed out, he deliberately chose to abscond on the 21 December 2017 and a warrant of arrest was issued against him. Thereafter, he committed a total of 9 offences, and the majority was under the MDA. His crime spree only ended on the 15 August 2018 when the warrant of arrest against him was executed. There was every possibility that he would have carried on committing more offences, if he had not been apprehended when the enforcement officers went to his residence. If the commission of offences while on court bail is considered an aggravating factor, I would reckon that similarly, it must also be viewed that there is a far higher degree of aggravation when an accused person commits offences knowing full well that he has jumped bail and a warrant of arrest was out for him.

34     I shall deal firstly with the MDA offences as they are obviously the most egregious that the accused is facing considering that the LT2 offence alone of consumption of a specified drug carries a lengthy period of incarceration of 7 years with 6 strokes of the cane. There can be no doubt therefore that the law takes a serious view of such offences. Drug activities are regarded as a dreaded scourge and the predominant interest is the protection of society from the menace and social evils associated with drug abuse. Deterrence therefore takes centre stage in determining the appropriate sentence for offences under the MDA.

35     For his LT2 offence, since I had imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane, I can only presume that the accused is not dissatisfied with this sentence. As for the possession offence of a class A drug, which is methamphetamine, the 10 month imprisonment term sought by the prosecution was reasonable and in fact on the lenient side. Applying the guideline judgment in the case of _Dinesh Singh Bhatia v PP_ where it was held that all drug offences involving the possession of Class A controlled drugs attract custodial sentences, save in purely exceptional cases, the court also established that the range of sentences for imprisonment with regard to such offences starts at six months (for a young 18 year old offender) and extends right up to 18 months for a first offender.

36     The accused, while technically a first offender for the possession of a class A controlled drug charge, was not exactly a novice where drugs were concerned considering his DRC admission which went as far back as 2001, his previous convictions under the MDA and the 6 other MDA charges which he was facing. Since he is a mature 35 year old offender, he should be placed at the higher end of the sentencing range. Hence, I accepted the prosecution’s submission and imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment for this offence.

37     In respect of his failure to report for urine test, based on his record, it was undisputed that this was not the first time he had committed such an offence, as he had 1 previous similar conviction in 2013 and he was sentenced to a 6 month imprisonment term with 4 similar charges being TIC. The accused did not offer any reason why he had not complied with the order to submit himself for urine tests which he had failed to do so since July, 2017. While he had pleaded guilty to 1 count, there were 2 other similar charges which had been TIC for the purpose of sentencing with his consent. It is trite law that the approach the courts should adopt if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offence proceeded with would be increased.

38     While it remained speculative, the accused was in actuality avoiding the possibility of being charged with more LT2 charges for consumption as he admitted that he failed to report because he had relapsed into abusing drugs (at paragraph 31 of the SOF). As for the individual sentence for the current charge, I referred to the case of _PP v Mohammad Sabri Bin Talip (MA 246/2009/01)_, where the sentence of 6 months imprisonment per charge for failure to report for a urine test was increased on appeal to 9 months imprisonment. In the case cited, the accused there had previous similar convictions for failure to report for urine tests. I agree with the prosecution that the sentence to be imposed should be higher than a 6 months imprisonment term and hence ordered a term of 9 months imprisonment for this offence of the accused having failed to report for a urine test.

39     Turning now to the rest of the offences, and starting with the section 7(1)(a) offence under the CESOW Act of being in possession of scheduled weapons, the prosecution tendered a sentencing table which indicated that usual sentence was 6 months imprisonment with the mandatory 6 strokes of the cane. However, from this table it can be gleaned that in those cases, the offender there was apprehended with only 1 weapon. In the case of this accused, he was found with 3 weapons, namely 1 white samurai sword, 1 big sword and 1 black dagger. This would put his case on a different plane and he should therefore receive a sentence higher than the 6 months sought by the prosecution. There was also another charge which was TIC, and similar in nature, namely an offence under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act of found being armed with an offensive weapon which was a night stick without lawful authority. Nevertheless, exercising some leniency towards him I accepted the prosecution’s submission on sentence and imposed 6 months imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane for the section 7(1)(a) offence under the CESOW Act.

40     As for the offences involving the police officers, firstly under section 353 of using criminal force where the accused had spat at Officer Lee, I note from the table of precedents submitted by the prosecution for similar offences, that the usual sentence was in the range of 8 to 12 weeks imprisonment. The submission for a 2 month imprisonment term by the prosecution was therefore not unduly severe. The act of spitting was particularly degrading and extremely insulting as some of the accused’s spittle landed at the corner of Officer Lee’s mouth (at paragraph 10 of the SOF). Where offences against police officers are concerned, I am guided by the case of _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ , where it was held that the key sentencing consideration for such offences is that of general deterrence to reflect society’s opprobrium for such offences and to assure police officers of adequate protection by the law that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties. While the case cited was in relation to a section 332 offence under the Penal Code of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, it cannot be denied that the comments in that case would also be relevant for offences under section 353 and for that matter under section 6(3) of the POHA, when police officers are the victims.

41     In respect of the section 6(3) of the POHA charge of using abusive words on Officer Sean, there were 2 other similar counts under the same section where the accused had verbally abused 2 other police officers. Clearly the torrent of verbal abuse was not a one off incident and such conduct clearly call for a custodial sentence. The police officers were at the scene in response to the complainant’s call for help as the accused had not only urinated on the onions belonging to the complainant’s restaurant but had reacted violently when the staff tried to stop him. While the accused may have been drunk at the time of the offences, it is accepted that being intoxicated is not a mitigating factor. The police officers are authority figures whose authority must be upheld in the public interest. Acts that erode public trust and confidence in the authority of the police must be met with a deterrent sentence. The appropriate sentence for the section 6 (3) POHA offence, under these circumstances, in my view would be a term of 1 month imprisonment.

42     The next issue to be considered would be the terms of imprisonment which should be ordered to run consecutively. While I am mindful that at the very minimum, only 2 terms of imprisonment needed to be ordered to run consecutively as long as it includes the longest term, considering the number of offences which the accused had committed, the aggravating factor of him absconding from court bail and offending while on the run, I was of the view that making 3 terms of imprisonment run consecutively would be appropriate. This would be the sentences for the LT2 offence, the section 353 offence and the failure to report for the urine test. These charges involve the invasion of separate and distinct legally protected interests. They were committed at different dates and location. Taking into account the accused’s overall criminality, his age, future prospects and his past records, 3 terms of imprisonment running consecutively would not offend the totality principle and the one transaction rule. The resulting sentence of 7 years and 11 months imprisonment cannot be described as crushing given that the longest individual sentence alone for the LT2 offence carries the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years imprisonment and there was no increase in the mandatory strokes.

43     All considered, taking into account all the relevant factors including the plea in mitigation, I passed the following sentences on the accused:

44     The total sentence of the accused is therefore 7 year and 11 months imprisonment with effect from 16 August 2018 as the accused had been in remand since this date and 12 strokes of the cane. He is currently serving his sentence.
