### District Judge Marvin Bay:

### Introduction

Ms Ace Lai Tze Mun (Ms Lai), s Singaporean aged 36, pleaded guilty to multiple charges under section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. These concerned acts of corrupt gratification by Ms Lai, who was the sole director of Intetech Solutions Pte Ltd (Intetech). Intetech’s business activities include the provision of information technology enterprise solutions and process integration to its clients. These activities would include fulfilling the hardware and software requirements of their clients’ Information Technology (IT) systems.

2       The proceeded charges of private sector corruption involved four of Intetech’s clients, which spanned a diverse range of commercial activities and services. The clients were Food Junction Management Pte Ltd (‘_Food Junction’_), Rodyk & Davidson LLP (‘_Rodyk_’), Bodynits International Pte Ltd (_‘Bodynits’_) and Absolute Kinetics Consultancy Pte Ltd (‘_AKC_’). As Intetec’s sole director, Ms Lai oversaw the accounts of these clients, and also dealt directly with the implicated representatives of all four of these clients.

3       To afford a better sense of charges Ms Lai faced, I will set out two of the five proceeded charges[^1]:

4       In DAC-922413-2017 (the fourth listed charge, and first proceeded charge)[^2]

> (Ms Lai was) charged that (she), the director of Intetech Solutions Pte Ltd, on a day in 2014, in Singapore, did corruptly give a gratification of a sum of no less than S$5,000 (Five Thousand Dollars), to an agent, to wit, one Chan Myae Naing Nyunt, a IT executive in the employ of Food Junction Management Pte Ltd, as an inducement for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, for advancing the business interest of Intetech Solutions Pte Ltd with Chan Myae Naing Nyunt’s employer and (she had) thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

5       In DAC-922417-2017 (the eighth listed charge, and third proceeded charge)[^3]

> (Ms Lai was) charged that (she) on a day in March 2015, in Singapore, did corruptly give a gratification of a sum of S$11,000 (Eleven Thousand Dollars), to an agent, to wit, one Aw Hock Poh @ Alvin , the Head of Information Technology in the employ of Rodyk and Davidson LLP as an inducement for doing an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, for advancing the business interest of Intetech Solutions Pte Ltd with Aw Hock Poh @ Alvin’s employer and (she had) thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Chapter 241.

### Admitted facts

6       The following are a _precis_ of the facts admitted by Ms Lai in the Statement of Facts[^4] in relation to the proceeded charges.

### The 4th Charge – DAC-922413-2017

7       Ms Lai had been induced by Mr Chan Myae Naing Nyunt, an IT executive at Food Junction, and who had been tasked with procuring IT products for his company, to pay over monies in return for recommending Intetech for _Food Junction’s_ IT purchases. Mr Chan had proposed for Intetech to **_inflate_** the prices quoted to _Food Junction_ so that when _Food Junction_ paid for the Intetech’s purchases, Ms Lai would have some cover to give Mr Chan surreptitious payments, being the difference between the actual and inflated pricing. Ms Lai has admitted to agreeing to this arrangement as she had been keen to acquire _Food Junction’s_ business for Intetech, and also because of the good margin to be earned from Intetech’s services.

8       This proceeded charge is with regard to an instance in 2014, when Ms Lai met Mr Chan at Regent hotel to give him an amount ‘_exceeding $5,000’_ in exchange for Mr Chan’s recommending Intetech to _Food Junction_ for IT purchases.

### The 7th and 8th Charges – DAC-922416-2017 and DAC-922417-2017

9       The seventh and eighth charges are in relation to Ms Lai’s dealings with a certain Alvin Aw Hock Poh, the Head of IT at Rodyk & Davidson LLP (_Rodyk_), whom she had known since 2007, and who was tasked with procuring IT products and services for the law firm.

10     The facts show that in 2012, _Rodyk_ became one of Intetech’s biggest clients, with Intetech providing both IT products such as laptop and related accessories, and IT services such as software maintenance for _Rodyk_. In 2014, Mr Aw had contacted Ms Lai in respect of laptop purchases for _Rodyk_, hinting that he already had several quotes from other IT companies and suggested that he could give the business to Intetech by telling Ms Lai how much to quote. Mr Aw asked for a monetary reward for his assistance in securing the business. Ms Lai understood that Mr Aw’s proposal required her to inflate the prices Intetech quoted to _Rodyk_ to allow the notional mark-up to be paid to Mr Aw, in consideration of his giving the jobs from _Rodyk_ to Intetech.

11     For the proceeded charges, DAC 922416-2017 involved a sum of $8,000 and DAC 922417-2017, a larger sum of $11,000. The transactions would involve Ms Lai **_herself_** picking up Mr Aw in her car and then passing the corrupt gratification to him in the car. This was done with a view to having Mr Aw continue giving business to Intetech by recommending Intetech to _Rodyk_ for IT purchases.

### Facts relating to 14th Charge – DAC-922423-2017

12     The fourteenth charge involved Ms Lai’s dealings with a Kuik Kai Kun Nicholas, whom she had known since 2010. Mr Kuik was working as an IT Network Administrator at _Bodynits_. In June 2013, after Mr Kuik had confided his financial problems, Ms Lai had offered him sums of money if he could award business to Intetech, Mr Kuik was forthright in telling her that there is no ‘_strict necessity’_ to get multiple quotes in _Bodynits_, and offered to moderate his illicit gratuity, as there were no competing quotes. In that month, Ms Lai decided to give a sum of money to Mr Kuik to ‘thank’ him for the business he was giving to Intetech.

13     The arrangements continued from that point, with Mr Kuik purchasing IT products, usually laptops, from _Bodynits_, in return for commissions based on the scale of purchases, which Ms Lai paid out, with a view to getting business from _Bodynits_.

14     In May 2015, _Bodynits_ had purchased 13 laptops from Intetech and Ms Lai agreed to pay him $1,300 on 9 June 2015. The transaction did not occur as both were arrested by CPIB.

### Facts relating to 15th Charge – DAC-922424-2017

15     In April 2014, one of Ms Lai’s staff members; Mr Wilson Ong, informed her that a certain Mr Gavin Ho Yue Guan, an IT manager at _AKC_, was looking for vendors to handle an IT project and was willing to help Intetech secure the project for a commission.

16     After discussions with the involved staff member, Mr Ho agreed to give Intetech inside information to help Intetech secure the IT project worth some $178,000 for a sum of S$2,500 in return. In April 2015, Ms Lai arranged to meet Mr Ho for lunch and then handed S$2,500 to Mr Ho. Mr Ho accepted the monies and they parted ways. When Ms Lai gave the monies to Mr Ho, she wanted to thank Mr Ho for helping Intetech secure the project and these monies were in exchange for Mr Ho recommending Intetech to AKC for IT purchases.

17     To afford a perspective view of the extent of tainted transactions, the learned DPP has attached a table in the Statement of Facts that Ms Lai accepted, which is reproduced for ease of reference:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="24.9776852127343%"> <col width="25.0074382624219%"> <col width="25.0074382624219%"> <col width="25.0074382624219%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Client</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sales Period</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Sales Volume</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Proportion linked to corrupt monies</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Food Junction</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2014-2015</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$61,493.70</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">56%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Rodyk</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2013-2015</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$892,997.87</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>Bodynits</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2014-2015</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$319,601.10</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>AKC</em></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2014</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$178,124.61</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">100%</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

18     To explain the above, the chart seeks to compare the tainted transactions against the total business volumes: For _Food Junction_ where the acts were committed between 2014 and 2015, the turnover was $61,493.70, and the tainted transactions involved 56% of total transactions with the company. For their _Rodyk_ account, from 2013 – 2015, the turnover was $892,997.87, with 25% of the transactions being tainted. For _Bodynits_, where the offences were committed between 2014 and 2015, the value of total transactions was $319,601.10 with 35% implicated. For _AKC_, the sole transaction in 2014 involved a singular set of dealings worth $178,124.61, and was thus entirely implicated.

19     The total cumulative bribe sum involved between Ms Lai and the respective receivers, Mr Chan, Mr Aw, Mr Kuik and Mr Ho for the proceeded charges, amounted to **_$44,004.10_** from 2011 to 2015. Ms Lai also assented to having ten charges of the same genre of corruption offences being taken into consideration for the purpose sentencing.

### Antecedents

20     While there were entries in Ms Lai’s criminal record, these were in respect of infractions committed in 1996, where Ms Lai was ordered to reside at a Juvenile Home for a term of 24 months, and subject to inhalant supervision for 12 months. I did not, of course, regard these as meaningful antecedents for the purpose of sentencing.

### Sentencing submissions

### Prosecution’s submissions

21     The learned DPP recommended a global custodial term of 24 weeks’ imprisonment, and gave a set of cogent, if brief, submissions. She indicated her view that the present case fell under the first and second categories of case types enunciated in _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ \[2015\] 3 SLR 11662. Here Ms Lai had bribed four separate individuals on the following two bases**:**

> i.     To obtain a benefit from these persons that is within their power to confer, i.e to recommend Intetech for the IT purchases of the respective companies, without regard to whether Intetech ought properly to have received that benefit

> ii.     To forebear from what they are duty bound to do, i.e to ensure that the procurement was properly carried out and that the vendor selected was the most competitive vendor. [^5]

22     The DPP also alluded to the presence of multiple aggravating factors, including the presence of premeditation in the scheme to agree with the respective receivers to carry out the arrangement to inflate the prices quoted to their respective companies, the large quantum of gratification of $44,004.10 which correlates to the harm caused by the bribe, and the fact that Ms Lai had given gratification, over multiple occasions in a period of at least four years, to these four different receivers. Given the amount of turnover involved, and the percentage of impugned transactions which were connected with the corrupt gratifications, she noted that _‘(t)he accused’s company, Intetech, has benefitted substantially_’[^6].

### Sentencing parity with conspiring party

23     Parity was also a relevant consideration. The learned DPP aditionally referenced the fact that one of the receivers, Mr Chan Myae Naing Nyunt, had upon his guilty plea, been sentenced in another district court to terms of 10 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, ultimately receiving a cumulative global sentence of 20 weeks’ imprisonment, along with a penalty of $13,579.10, The DPP also invited the court to maintain a congruent level of sentencing parity, and juxtaposed the relative culpabilities of Ms Lai and Mr Chan Myae[^7] in the following manner.

24     After factoring in the points of mitigation applicable to Ms Lai, as well as the fact that Mr Chan had been the initiator of their corrupt arrangement, the DPP proposed that Ms Lai’s sentence should be three weeks lower than the ten weeks imposed on the counterparty to her corrupt acts in respect of the _Food Junction_ account.

25     The learned DPP then used the submitted seven-week term as a reference point to anchor imprisonment terms to the other four charges, using the bribe quantum as the variable, with the indicative quantum adjusted downwards for lower sums and upwards for higher sums of unlawful gratification. By such extrapolation, the DPP derived the following recommended sentences[^8], with the asterisk denoting consecutive sentencing being proposed:

26     The DPP had advocated the running of three sentences consecutively ‘_to reflect the accused’s culpability of giving bribes to four different receivers’_ and that she regarded the recommended total sentence of 24 weeks’ imprisonment to be a condign punishment which ‘(took) _into account the accused’s overall culpability and is also consistent with the sentencing precedents…_(showing) _that custodial terms upwards of 4 months (ie 16 weeks) are imposed for bribe amounts ranging from $30,000 - $40,000 are given to_ **_one_**[^9]_receiver_’.[^10] Consequently, Ms Lai’s acts of bribing four distinct individuals from separate companies should be regarded as being sufficiently egregious to attract a significantly heavier sentence. Again, using Mr Chan Myae’s case as a yardstick, the DPP noted that Mr Chan had received a global term of 20 weeks’ imprisonment as receiver of a lower aggregate bribe sum of some $13 000. Ms Lai, who had doled out some $44 000 in bribes, should receive a **_higher_** sentence than Mr Chan. She had thus pitched the appropriate term to be the recommended 24 weeks’ imprisonment.

### Circumstances stated in mitigation plea

27     Counsel stated that Ms Lai had emerged from a hardscrabble childhood where she had been brought up by her grandmother _in lieu_ of her neglectful parents. Ms Lai had also overcome a course of youthful indiscretion, where she had ‘_dabbled in drugs’_ and which had landed her in a Girls’ Home, and gone on to found Intetech, which undertook the business of sourcing for lT software and hardware equipment from suppliers, and selling these to its customers, often bundled together with a service package, in 2010[^11].

28     In the narrative presented, Ms Lai’s descent in criminal activity was principally attributed to the malign influence of three individuals; Mr Wilson Ong, Mr George Tan and Mr Chan Myae, the former being her employee[^12]. There was a matrix of cross-dealings with these individuals spanning from 2011, which counsel took considerable pains to detail[^13]. I have set out a condensed version below.

29     Mr Lai had hired Mr Wilson Ong in late 2013 upon the recommendation of her close business acquaintance Mr George Tan to work as a sales executive where his job scope encompassed looking for potential customers, and negotiating contracts to provide lT services and equipment to these customers. She had set Mr Ong a sales target of $ 15 000 a month, and Ms Lai had assisted further by giving him a customer database to work on. Mr Ong was Wilson was entitled to a sales commission of ten percent of sales made, if he met his monthly target.

### Background to Food Junction charge (DAC-922413-2017)[^14]

30     Ms Lai had secured the _Food Junction_ account after a contact had alerted her of their IT needs. Ms Lai had liaised with Mr Chan Myae, an lT executive of Food Junction, and secured initial orders from them in 2010. There were no illicit payments made to Chan Myae for these early orders.

31     ‘Sometime in 2011’[^15], Mr Chan Myae called Ms Lai over the phone discretely asked for her co-operation, telling her of an available project to offer. Mr Chan Myae had engineered the means to obtain illicit kickbacks by asking Ms Lai to raise her proposed selling price, to allow him to ‘share’ some of her profits. Ms Lai was reportedly initially reluctant, but ‘caved in under pressure’ to Mr Chan Myae’s persistent coaxing.

32     Upon her agreeing ‘help him’, Ms Lai had, on two occasions given Mr Chan Myae part of the profits from her sales (the subjects of the charges DAC-922410-2017 and DAC-922411-2017 which Ms Lai agreed to have taken into consideration) in 2011. Ms Lai had no recollection of the exact amounts given on these occasions. ln mid-2012, Ace rejected Chan Myae's request as she was ‘tired’ of his asking her for surreptitious favours.

33     Despite having the use of the customer database of potential customers whom he could approach, Mr Wilson Ong had from October to December 2013 invariably failed to meet his sales target, which was set at $15 000. Ms Lai contemplated terminating his employment, but relented to his entreaties for a ‘second chance’. ln early 2014, Mr Ong had told her that _Food Junction_ was willing to place orders with lntetech. The catch was that Mr Chan Myae had asked Mr Ong whether lntetech was prepared to give him a commission, ‘just like in the past’. [^16]

34     Ms Lai had been prepared to do business with _Food Junction_ as a former client, but baulked at the notion of re-entering Mr Chan Myae’s scheme. Mr Ong however indicated that he had already informed Mr Chan Myae that Intetech was prepared to go along with his request for secret commissions. Mr Ong had also _‘pleaded with_ (Ms Lai) _that he needed to close this deal with Food Junction in order to meet his targets_’ and that his continued employment was critical for his ensuing marriage plans. Ms Lai had relented ‘(_a)fter much pleading and insistence_’ to the corrupt arrangement.

### Background to the Rodyk charges (DAC-922416-2017 & DAC-922417-2017)

35     Ms Lai’s dealings with _Rodyk_ encompass two proceeded charges (the 7th and 8th charges) Her history with law firm predated the formation of Intetech, and Ms Lai had known _Rodyk’s_ Head of It; Mr Alvin Aw since 2008, when she worked as an Accounts Manager with Lenovo Singapore, and had been placed in charge of sales to the legal sector. After Ms Lai had opened lntetech in 2010, Mr Aw had contacted her to make purchases on behalf of his company.

36     Counsel explained that as Intetech was a reseller of IT products, Ms Lai would, in the ordinary course, receive promotional and promotional gifts from her suppliers, which were intended to be passed on to her customers to incentivise their future purchases. Ms Lai would duly pass on these incentivising offerings to her customers, including Rodyk when orders were made in September 2013 Ms Lai was in a dilemma, when she ran out of vouchers and promotional gifts. Mr Aw had pressured her despite her explanation that she had run out of these vouchers and promotional gifts, and had made arrangements to replenish her supply. Mr Aw was reportedly implacable and ‘_suggested to_ (Ms Lai) _that she could send cash instead of the vouchers, since in principle it amounted to the same value_’. Ms Lai succumbed and _‘reluctantly caved in and handed over the equivalent_ (to the vouchers) _in cash_’[^17].

### Background to the Bodynits charge (DAC-922423-2017)

37     The circumstances surrounding the _Bodynits_ charge[^18] follow the same narrative pattern of Ms Lai being situationally drawn to commit corrupt acts despite her claimed inclination to avoid shady criminal arrangements. Ms Lai had known _Bodynits’_ Nicholas Kuik since 2010, and was aware and sympathetic of his personal circumstances as a single-parent divorcee.

38     Counsel also alluded to Mr Kuik being instigated to press Ms Lai for secret commissions by Mr Wilson Ong. Mr Ong had after joining the company in October 2013, made his acquaintance with Mr Kuik a month later. ln early 2014, Mr Ong had asked to manage the _Bodynits_ account.

39     In August 2014, Mr Kuik had ‘_shared his personal circumstances with (Ms Lai) and he was crying and extremely emotional when he did so’_ and asked her to ‘_share some of her profits with him, to tide him through a difficult period’._[^19] Ms Lai had suspected, and resented, Mr Ong’s instigation behind Mr Kuik’s appeal, but had been aware of his financial difficulties, and empathised as her own father was unwell. Hence, Ms Lai had caved in _‘(a)s her company was doing quite well, (Ms Lai) decided not to take issue with_ (Mr Kuik) _for his suggestion, and eventually relented by allowing him to share some of the profits with her.’_[^20]

### Background to the AKC charge

40     The _AKC_ charge again follows the familiar narrative thread of Mr Ong initiating a set of shady dealings and then imposing on Ms Lai to help him from a self-created quandary. Ms Lai had known _AKC’s_ IT manager Gavin Ho since December 2013, after he had been introduced to her by Mr George Tan and Mr Wilson Ong. In May 2014, Mr Ong had approached Ms Lai to green light his plan to obtain a deal from AKC, with a view to achieving his sales target. Ms Lai had been surprised of this _coup_ as AKC had been one of George Tan’s loyal customers. Mr Ong then revealed that the deal had been referred to him by Mr Tan, and premised upon Mr Tan’s own intent to leave his company.

41     Mr Ong had then revealed a critical detail of his plan, that ‘…_in order to win the deal, a small sum of money had to be paid to_ (Mr Gavin Ho) _so that they could gain insight into the pricings of the other competitors_.’ Essentially this gratification was for insider information, as the bribe _‘… did not mean that lntetech would secure the deal..(_but) _would just enable them to improve on their sales pitch._’[^21]

42     Counsel gave very considerable background detail on Ms Lai’s reaction to Mr Ong’s proposal in the mitigation plea in an apparent bid to show that Mr Wilson Ong was the true progenitor of the corrupt schemes associated with the proceeded charges. Counsel’s elaboration, however, also reveals Ms Lai as a canny individual who was not at all vulnerable to manipulation, as well as a strategic thinker with a keen eye on the proverbial ‘bottom-line’ of the business. The revealed details do, in my mind, belie defence counsel’s characterisation of Ms Lai as a pliant and passive individual, who had fallen into criminality because of her ill-considered desire to help a wayward employee. This is quite evident at \[13\](d) of the Mitigation plea, which is set out _in extensio_ to illustrate this.

> d.    On hearing this[^22], (Ms Lai) was extremely annoyed that (Mr Ong) had come to her with another possible deal, only to say that (her) company would have to share its profits yet again**_._** As (Ms Lai) had approximately 170 clients and none of them required sharing of profits or any such payments,(**_Ms Lai) refused (Mr Ong's) suggestion and told him that he could not continue working in this way, as the company could not afford to keep making such payments._** Furthermore, all these payments only related to deals which (Mr Ong) seemed to be a part of. (Ms Lai) strongly suspected that it was actually (Mr Ong) who was suggesting this to the customers, and then coming back to (her) to claim that it was the customer who had requested for it. {Emphasis added\]

43     I found it notable that Ms Lai’s discomfiture with Mr Ong’s proposal to bribe Mr Gavin Ho for the _AKC_ contract was premised primarily on the scheme incurring costs that she deemed extraneous, rather than any **_principled_** basis, such as notions of morality or legality.

44     According to defence counsel, Ms Lai was subject to Mr Ong’s ‘pestering’ that _‘he required the deal to go through in order for him to meet his sales target’_. He also pleaded that he needed the money for his marriage, and anticipated child expenses. Ms Lai ‘_eventually reluctantly caved in and allowed him to take on the deal’_. After negotiations, _AKC_ awarded lntetech the contract, which was the subject matter of the charge, in August 2014.

### Key points of mitigation

45     Defence counsel in his penultimate set of submissions[^23] reiterated that Ms Lai had been taken advantage by Mr Ong and Mr Aw, who _‘knew that she had a soft-spot in always wanting to help people’_. He also contended that Intetech was not a ‘_criminal enterprise’_ and Ms Lai had not set out to teach Mr Ong, or any of her other staff to conduct business in this manner. Rather, ‘_it was_ (Mr Ong) _who suggested this to her_.’ Hence Ms Lai was ‘_never the initiator, and she proceeded with the arrangements with reluctance’_.

46     Counsel noted that Intetech had some 170 customers, and the company had not entered into such illicit arrangements with other customers. The profits earned by lntetech as a result of the impugned transactions represented ‘_only 8.25 percent of lntetech's entire profits during this time period_.’ Counsel also emphasized that Ms Lai had made full and voluntary disgorgements of all profits made by lntetech.

47     Counsel also asserted that there were _‘no losses or real harm suffered’_ by the involved companies in the sense of there being an absence of defects in the goods and services suppled. Apart from _AKC_, the other companies (_Rodyk, Bodynits_ and _Food Junction_) were already existing customers of Intetech and there was ‘_already a pre-existing relationship that was independent of the corrupt transactions’_. He submitted that the goods and services supplied were not overpriced and asserted that the Intetech supplied the **_lowest_** quotes.

### My brief observations of the points made in mitigation

48     Taking first counsel’s contention that Intetech supplied the ‘_lowest quotes._’ I found this point rather dubious, as counsel has not set out any competing quotes in respect of the impugned transactions in the proceeded charges. It would also be quite evident that the exercise of obtaining of vendor quotes can, in any case, be readily manipulated, and the integrity of the procurement process immediately comes into question once the key individual responsible for purchasing is **_suborned_** by bribery[^24]. The obvious question arises why Ms Lai (or her confederates) would resort to bribery if she had been confident that her bid was the lowest one in a fair and open competitive field.

### Wilson Ong’s sales target ‘dilemma’ is contrived

49     In the same vein, I found the blame-assignment to Mr Wilson Ong as the principal malefactor to be patently contrived. Mr Ong is characterised as an insidious and persistent instigator in pushing Ms Lai to entering into successive corrupt transactions, where he had relentlessly exploited her eagerness to help him retain his job with Intetech by propping up his sales target quota. This again begs the point of how and why Ms Lai; the founder and **_sole_** director of Intetech, would have deigned to allow the metaphorical tail to wag the proverbial dog. Within the organisation, Mr Ong was a mere employee, and the provided facts do not show that his employment was otherwise than at her pleasure. The assertion that she was constrained to embark onto corrupt acts just for him to maintain an acceptable sales target seems to be an entirely artificial contrivance. I will explain my analysis below.

50     Mr Ong’s job (along with his marriage and eventual parenthood plans) was stated to be at risk as a result of his not meeting sales targets, despite her assistive efforts, which included her helpful provision of client lists. In this connection, it is surprising that Ms Lai, as sole director, would have lacked the capacity to give Mr Ong a deferment, if not an outright dispensation of the sales target (which she **_herself_** had set) if he were a truly outstanding employee, who was worthy of retention. On the aspect of Mr Ong missing out on the sales commissions applicable to the securing of the impugned contracts, there is nothing to suggest that Ms Lai (of whom counsel has attributed to be very inclined to help others) could not have made any adjustments to his bonuses or other discretionary emoluments to tide Mr Wilson Ong through his financial problems.

51     Ultimately, given that Mr Ong’s employment terms and his performance targets would be logically within the **_purview_** of the executive discretion Ms Lai exercised as the sole director of the company she founded, the dilemma of sales targets appears to be a **_self-created_** conundrum, which was resolvable and adjustable within Intetech itself. Any resentment from a possible perception within Intetech personnel of undue favourable treatment for Mr Ong that might ensue as a result of such action would be a minor H R[^25] problem, paling against Ms Lai actually green-lighting, and then participating in multiple acts of bribery in her haste to ‘help’ Mr Wilson Ong achieve his targets and attain his commissions.

### Accused’s alleged plaint behaviour in implausible

52     I found Ms Lai’s apparent **_malleability_** to influence to be somewhat surprising given her asserted background as an experienced IT specialist, and a self-made entrepreneur with an ability to profitably adapt on-the-shelf software to customise a suite of IT services and solutions for her clients.

53     Further, Ms Lai had the gumption and drive to leave Lenovo and start Intetech from scratch. She had known _Food Junction’s_ Mr Chan Myae, and had indeed pushed back when he had asked for a resumption of kickbacks. It is thus remarkable that she would have become so pliant as to reverse her aversion to offering bribes and ratify the arrangement merely on the basis that Mr Ong had already agreed on Intetech’s behalf, without informing her.

54     I would note that, except for _AKC’s_ Gavin Ho, Ms Lai had known her bribe recipient counterparties well before[^26] Mr Ong’s employment in late 2013. Hence the notion that Mr Wilson Ong’s employment had somehow alchemically altered the tenor of these personal and professional relationships to drive Ms Lai to multiple counts of criminality is, in my view, utterly implausible.

### Bribes were premeditated rather than impulse or pressure driven actions after influence by recipients or employees

55     At most I would accept that Ms Lai had somehow allowed herself to be surrounded by an employee and commercial associates who seemed keen to bend the rules and break applicable laws, to seek personal pecuniary advantages from business dealings, and had been won over by their rationalisations and related personal struggles, and despite knowing the consequences for discovered acts of corruption, eventually made a **_deliberate_** and **_conscious_** decision to ‘buy in’ and embrace their corrupt manner of dealings.

56     My observation is borne both by the **_nature_** (seen in Ms Lai’s direct involvement in personally passing bribes to recipients) and **_extent_** (as evidenced by there being multiple proceeded and TIC charges across a diverse range of recipients) of her criminal acts of bribery. This would be against the grain from counsel’s characterisation of Ms Lai’s mere acquiescence of treating a corrupt scheme arranged by Mr Wilson Ong to be a _fait accompli_, where she had unaccountably lacked the will to impose her authority to reverse this corrupt plan, and passively ratified his proposed bribe. It is, in my judgment, a congruent fact that Ms Lai’s history of making illicit payments had, on the facts related to this court, begun with her paying Mr Chan Myae in 2011. This is therefore not the case of a person perpetrating a spontaneous and inexplicable spree of criminality in the two-year span of the proceeded charges (2014 to 2015). Before that time, Ms Lai’s professional dealings cannot be said to be immaculate, and was hardly asymptomatic of criminal behaviour.

57     Counsel has also sought to mitigate by stressing that the corrupt transactions constituted _‘only’_ 8.25 percent of profits earned by Intetech in the period that the offences were committed. The defence had sought to demonstrate that Ms Lai did not run a ‘_criminal enterprise’_ and that the majority of Intetech’s dealings had not involved bribery. In this regard, I would readily accept that for the majority of Intetech’s dealings, the contracts could be secured **_without_** any bribes being paid. It would only be rational to assume that bribes would **_only_** be paid where they were perceived to be **_needed_** or **_conducive_** to unlawfully induce a favourable outcome (eg where the counterparty had specifically asked for a bribe, as in Chan Myae’s, Nicholas Kuik’s and Alvin Au’s cases). As is plain from the record, Ms Lai was vehemently opposed to making payments she deemed unnecessary to fulfil the desired outcome (as she had decried the drain[^27] on company resources), and had been openly resentful where she had suspected Intetech employee Mr Ong and _Bodynits’_ Mr Kuik to have been colluding to extract bribes from her, with the former perceived to be instigating the latter for Ms Lai to ‘share’ her profits.

### Principally venal motive rather than altruism

58     Further, in characterising Intetech as being a highly successful company, the obvious **_flip side_** must be addressed. This lay primarily in discerning Ms Lai’s motivation for her actions. It would be apparent from counsel’s narrative that Ms Lai had committed the crimes while Intetech was **_not_** facing any financial pressure. I found counsel’s explanation of Ms Lai making these payments as a result of an innate urge to help _Rodyk’s_ Mr Au and _Bodynits’_ Mr Kuik to be unconvincing, as she had known the men personally, and nothing would have stopped her from extending friendly loans which were **_untethered_** to any reciprocal benefit of securing contracts from their respective companies, if she had indeed been operating from truly altruistic motives. Hence absent any existential threat of financial failure from insufficient business volume to Intetech, or the asserted altruistic intent, the only explicable reason for committing the offences would, with reductive reasoning, be for nothing more than for the venal purpose of personal gain. The previous footnoted example from the Mitigation Plea would unequivocally show that **_bottom-line considerations_** featured most prominently in Ms Lai’s calculations. Case law is plain that a giver who is driven by ‘greed’ or a similar motive within the genre of crimes committed for enrichment, or to gain some other unjust benefit, should be accorded a more severe sentence than one acting on fear or desperation to avoid an undesired consequence; see _Public Prosecutor v Chew Suang Heng_ \[2001\] 1 SLR (R) 127 at \[17\].

59     As alluded to above, while I am of the view that while Ms Lai’s decision to pay bribes was fully premeditated, and one contemplated with her complete awareness of the ramifications, I was prepared to consider the likelihood that she had been **_de-sensitised_** to the anathematic level of aversion to corruption prevalent in this country, because of her exposure to both her wayward employee and a brace of business contacts _cum_ customers who had persisted to urge her on this course. This was particularly evident in blandishments of _Rodyk’s_ Mr Au to treat the bribes as a substitute for the promotional gifts and vouchers that she would have given him.

60     It is a common phenomenon in white collar crime for offenders to rationalise their actions as being situationally ‘justifiable’. _Rodyk’s_ Mr Au had even **_trivialised_** his corrupt requests by equating the bribes to be a form of substituted payment for distributors’ vouchers and promotional gifts which Ms Lai could not deliver within his expected timeframe. The fact of Ms Lai making the two payments of $8000 and $11 000 demonstrate her ‘buying-in’ of this perverse argument. Ms Lai’s mitigation plea and subsequent addenda are sadly replete with examples where she seeks to explain away her offending by attributing instances of instigation and influence, as well as imposed constraints, to be the principal triggers propelling her to her wayward course. I accept that Ms Lai faced some pressures, not least from the insistent cajoling of her errant employee and customers to cross the lane. Nevertheless, to maintain Singapore’s hard-earned reputation to be among the foremost of jurisdictions with the least corruption, the courts must relentlessly act against tendencies to **_‘normalise’_** corrupt acts. This is principally done by the dissuasive effect of **_deterrent sentencing_**.

### The amount involved is not trivial

61     Defence counsel had put considerable effort to stress that Intetech’s corruption- tainted transactions amounted to a mere 8.25 percent of all transactions. Counsel had computed Intetech’s entire sales volume in the four-year period from 2011 to 2015, to amount to $12 969 837.75, while the sales volume associated with the business contracts in the 15 charges was stated to be $652 683.75, which is broken down as follows[^28]:

62     Counsel added that the actual total nett profit earned from these 15 charges was $78.218.90, which made up 8.25% of Intetech's overall profits during the four-year period. While I accepted counsel’s point that ‘_the offending conduct only occurred in an extremely small area of the company's business_.’, the aggregate amount involved in the 15 instances bribery is objectively large, it also remains quite plain that the bribes of **$44 004.10** (out of which $27 800 had been paid out for the five proceeded charges) had yielded the aforementioned nett profit of $78.218.90, which is not an insignificant sum. Our courts have generally taken the custodial line to have been crossed for cases involving similar factual matrices, sentencing considerations and equivalent (or indeed lower) bribe amounts.

63     My starting point in elaborating on the above proposition would be to cite the salient passages of _Sentencing Practice_[^29] where the commentary in the chapter for _Corruption Offences_ offers a useful crystallization of applicable principles[^30]:

> It is a recurrent theme of our jurisprudence that the main sentencing consideration _in all corruption_ cases is that of general deterrence. Needless to say, however, _the length of the custodial sentence or any other penalties_ should always be tied to the circumstances of each offence, particularly the nature of the favour sought as well as the inducement extended…

> In determining if the custodial threshold has been breached, the main determinant would be the mischief or likely consequence of the payment or acceptance of the bribe e.g, where the act of corruption undermined the administration of justice. The other significant factors, _inter alia_, would include, whether there was an abuse of a position of trust; the amount of bribe involved and the period over which the payments were made or received…

> **In the context of commercial dealings, the courts generally have regard to the amount of the bribe, the period over which the payments were made, the position of the offender, and the sacrifice of interests (if any) due to the bribe.**

> \[Non-bold italics in the original, italics in bold added for Emphasis\]

### Bribe quantum as a factor (among others) in evaluating if the custodial threshold is crossed

64     While the bribes in the five proceeded charges total $27 500, when the TIC charges ate considered, the aggregate sum of the 15 charges amount, in all, to $44 004.10. The Commentary in _Sentencing Practice_ alluded to custodial terms being more commonly imposed where bribe sums above $30 000 were involved, with high fines being often imposed for cases involving lower sums. It is patent, however that there is no ‘hard and fast’ rule[^31] of $30 000 being a notional ‘custodial threshold’. Rather, the denoted sum serves as a rough **_proxy_** to signal the degree of gravity with amounts below being generally likely to be _‘offences which register a lower level of culpability’_[^32]. This has to be considered together with **_other_** indicators to properly assess if the severity of offending would call for the imposition of custodial sanctions. This bundle of indicia was identified in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 117</span>, where the Chief Justice states at \[23\]:

> 23    In Singapore, it has been noted that where private sector corruption involves (a) **_a significant amount of gratification; (b) gratification which is received_**[^33] **_over a lengthy period of time; or (c) a compromise of one's duty_** or a serious betrayal of trust, **_the starting point is likely to be a custodial sentence._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

65     Ms Lai’s offending does unfortunately tick **_most_** of these boxes. In her first **_Addendum to Prosecution’s Skeletal Address on Sentence_**, the learned DPP submitted[^34] that there was **‘**_a common criminal enterprise’_ where Ms Lai had been ‘_the common denominator vis-à-vis the four receivers’_ and had ‘_embarked on this conduct vis-à-vis these receivers in a similar manner’_ which had the effect of _‘compromising the procurement process of the respective vendor_’.

### Accused’s pervasive use and ubiquitous application of bribery

66     I found the observation be quite valid. Ms Lai had in her four years of offending, developed her particular _modus operandi_ which had cut across the proceeded cases (which included her personal delivery of the bribes). While counsel had objected to the description of Intetech as a ‘criminal enterprise’ on the basis that much of their business did not involve illicit gratification, it was quite a different matter where the contemplation of the criminal conduct of Ms Lai **_herself_** was concerned[^35]. The proceeded and TIC charges showed Ms Lai to have an unvarying tendency to use bribery as a means to grease any squeaky wheel in her business dealings, as a salve to any resistance, and to ease the passage of her deals. She had done the same in various permutations. She had given corrupt gratification with or without Mr Wilson Ong’s involvement, to directly be awarded a contract (_Food Junction, Bodynits_), to salve displeasure over delays in distributors’ promotional vouchers and gifts (_Rodyk_), and to gain insider information so as to mount a successful bid for a lucrative contract_(AKC_).

67     It is also notable that Ms Lai’s spree was not **_demonstrably_** ended by her own will to quit her insidious practices but by the fact of her arrest. Ms Lai has admitted to having in May 2015, agreed to pay Mr Nicholas Kuik a secret commission of $1300 for _Bodynits’_ purchase of 13 laptops from Intetech, Ms Lai had arranged to pay him the sum on 9 June 2015, but the scheduled transaction had been pre-empted by their interdiction by CPIB. Counsel had stated in his Addendum to the Plea in Mitigation that ‘(Ms Lai) _eventually stopped accepting any further arrangements on her own accord, even before investigations commenced_.’

68     When challenged by DPP that ‘_this is not a case where actually, everything had stopped by the time CPIB investigation has started’ and that there was actually ‘still an ongoing arrangement’_ which Ms Lai did not carry through because of the CPIB investigations, lead counsel Shashi Nathan conceded that Ms Lai had indeed **_intended_** to proceed to make that payment when she was arrested, but that it had been a ‘_outstanding instalment_’ which she had felt compelled to honour and that his **_‘understanding’_** was that Ms Lai had otherwise given Mr Kuik a _‘clear indication’_ that she no longer wished to continue to bribe him[^36]. Counsel did not offer to furnish any evidence to substantiate this assertion.

69     In my view, therefore other than the universally valid consideration of general deterrence applicable to all genres of corruption cases, there was also a need for **_specific_** deterrence here to curb Ms Lai from her propensity to use bribery as a ubiquitous means to gain an upper hand in her business dealings.

### Three of the charges reach the second level of offending elucidated in ‘Mostafa Romel’

70     I agreed with the DPP that the nature of Ms Lai’s offending fell within the aggravated second category of the three categories[^37] established in the _Mostafa Romel_ case. In the case of the bribes paid to employees of _Food Junction_ and _Rodyk_, there was plainly a detriment to the principal, as the bribes had led to a subversion of the procurement process for IT services required by the company. This was distinct from the situation with _Bodynits_, as Mr Nicholas Kuik had in fact candidly told Ms Lai that he was not required to undertake any competitive bidding process, and indeed had even unilaterally moderated the sum of his requested bribe. The bribe paid in to _AKC’s_ Gavin Ho would also have placed the manner of offending within the first category, as the sum was paid for insider knowledge of the other bids which would be received. The bribes to _Food Junction’s_ Chan Myae and _Rodyk’s_ Alvin Au would have not just resulted in there being a metaphorical finger on the scales to disrupt any truly fair bidding and procurement, but actually pecuniary loss from price mark-ups to make up the secret commission, as aptly expressed by the learned DPP in the following terms[^38]:

> The benefit was actually obtained at the detriment of the principal. This is the case of Chan Myae and Alvin (Au) **_where the principal actually ended up paying higher prices for the IT purchases due to the mark-up arrangement_** … pursuant to which the corrupt monies was given out. {Emphasis added\]

71     The significance of Ms Lai’s offending falling into the second category is this; where a case falls within the first category, the question of whether the custodial threshold is crossed will depend on the facts. The second category of cases will, however, **_frequently attract custodial sentences_**. For completeness, offenders transgressing into the third category, where the corrupt act involves interference with or denial of a person’s legitimate rights unless a bribe is paid should **_generally expect a custodial sentence_** to be imposed.

### The instant facts are readily distinguishable from Heng Tze Yong v PP

72     Counsel has made repeated references to, and detailed extrapolations from, the case of _Heng Tze Yong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 225</span>[^39] to debunk DPPs position that Ms Lai should be given a custodial term to allow sentencing parity with Mr Chan Myae, and to principally buttress their case for fines to be imposed rather than terms of imprisonment.

73     In _Heng’s_ case, the accused had on May 2013, received a request from one Ben Ong for a bribe of S$3 000, which he had, with a view to preserving an existing business relationship, acceded to, and made payment about a week after. This bribe was the subject matter of the TIC charge. In June 2013, through Ben Ong’s influence, Mr Heng won a contract for the supply of HEPA filters worth S$28,380 for his company, and also in July 2013, a smaller contract of US $918 for parts cleaning services. In August 2013, the said Ben Ong requested another bribe of S$7 000 which Mr Heng paid (this being the basis of the proceeded charge), The receiver reciprocated with three contracts for the supply of HEPA filters worth $67 980, and a parts cleaning services contract worth US$1,530.

74     The accused in _Heng_ received a five week custodial term for the proceeded charge, and succeeded on appeal for this imprisonment term to be substituted with a fine of $35 000[^40]. Ben Ong, the receiver had received a term of eight weeks’ imprisonment in relation to his criminal act of corruptly receiving $7000 in the same transaction. Counsel has sought to reference the case to address Chan Myae’s custodial sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment[^41] for the co-responding charge involving the _Food Junction_ bribe of ‘_not less than_ $5000’, and cited this as an instance where co-accused persons can receive disparate sentences stating[^42]

> 11    Even in Heng Tze Yong, the High Court saw fit to impose only a fine on the offender (giver of the bribe), despite the co-accused (receiver of the bribe) having received an 8-week sentence in respect of the same charge. It is therefore clear that the Honourable Court does not have to impose a sentence in parity with the receiver of the bribe, as the Court will have to consider the specific factual matrix of the case. **_Similar to the offender in Heng Tze Yong_**, (Ms Lai) **_was not the offeror or initiator of the bribes, and this was done reluctantly after, on Chan Myae's behest_**.

> {Emphasis added\]

75     While there is an obvious parallel of Ms Lai not being the offeror of the bribe in the _Food Junction_ case, the dissimilarities outnumber the analogous aspects. While the accused in _Heng_ had a brief associative history with his co-accused, Ms Lai had known Mr Chan Myae since 2011, and had an antecedent history of giving him bribes.

76     More significantly, **_Ms Lai’s case involves herself_** **_serially_** **_being the party ‘induced’ to offer bribes_**. She had first given bribes to Mr Chan Myae, then to _Rodyk’s_ Alvin Au, then to _Bodynits’_ Nicholas Kuik, and finally to _AKC’s_ Gavin Ho. While two instances of bribery[^43] to one party within a four-month period might seem to be an instance of a businessman caving into pressure and acting on an urge to preserve an essential commercial relationship, Ms Lai’s spree which extended for four years, with fifteen separate transactions to the aforementioned four parties smacks more of a deliberate business model to, colloquially speaking, ‘_get things done’_.

77     As alluded to earlier, I found it eminently implausible that Ms Lai, a career IT specialist and seasoned businesswoman, would have been so pliant as to be passively and **_successively_** goaded into crime by Mr Chan, Mr Au, Mr Kuik and her own employee; Mr Wilson Ong, where she would have been allegedly otherwise disinclined to break the law. This being particularly evidenced by the fact that the transactions were predicated with **_different_** objectives in mind, including obtaining insider information in _AKC’s_ case. There was also no compelling stressor in her case, where the transaction represented just 8.35 percent of Intetech’s profits and 5.4 percent of business volume. The transactions also differ in magnitude. _Heng’s_ two charges amount to $96 380 (along with the small US denominated sums for the cleaning service contract), while Ms Lai’s fifteen charges encompass the sum of $652 683.75, which is about 6.8 times larger.

78     Counsel had sought to persuade the court that a non-custodial penalty was appropriate even where it was conceded that Ms Lai faced more charges, and that her offences took place over a longer period of time and involved four companies and states[^44]:

> 21    Here, the Defence accepts that any sentence imposed on (Ms Lai) will have to be higher than that imposed on the offenders in Heng Tze Yong and Thor (HC), however, the Defence respectfully submits that this can sufficiently achieved by imposing a substantially higher overall fine which is can also be regarded as a deterrent sentence.

> …

> 23.    For the reasons given above, the Defence respectfully submits that when the facts of the present case are considered holistically, and the aggravating factors are balanced with the mitigating factors which have been raised, the custodial threshold has not been crossed**_. Accordingly, the Defence respectful submits that only a high fine (even up to the maximum of $100,000 per charge, which would translate into a global fine of half a million dollars) will be a sufficiently deterrent sentence for Ace in the present case._** The fact that parliament had allowed for a range of fines up to $100,000 to be imposed clearly meant that they had envisioned situations which would attract such sentences alone. lf the present case were not one such situation, then under what circumstances would an offender qualify for a sentence of only the maximum fine?

### Aggravating aspects outweigh the mitigating factors

79     With all due respect, I do differ from counsel’s assessment of the mitigating circumstances _‘balancing’_ the aggravating factors. I do accept Ms Lai’s post arrest co-operation with the investigation, and her decision to plead guilty, rather than challenge the charges. Nevertheless, her mitigation reveals a dismal lack of **_insight_** on the gravity of her offending. Ms Lai essentially displayed an unfortunate lack of palpable remorse, which was especially pronounced by her laying attribution of blame firmly on the doors of her errant employee and contacts in the three of the four involved companies, and flagrantly ignoring her own role as the sole founding director of Intetech, and hence being the ultimate decision maker.

80     Most significantly, Ms Lai was, unlike _Heng_, no neophyte to acts of bribery. Given the considerations above, along with the authorities provided by prosecution, the paucity of cases where fines were imposed in similar instances (_Heng Tze Yong’s_ case being, from the analysis above, readily distinguishable), the facts of this case pointed indubitably toward a **_custodial_** sentence being the proper punishment for Ms Lai for the _Food Junction_ charge, and indeed for the remaining four proceeded charges.

### Why fines would be inappropriate

81     On counsel’s suggestion for a high fine, even up to the maximum fine of $100 000 being imposed, I would simply state that it would not be appropriate to parlay a fine, even an **_extremely_** high fine, as a substitute for a case that should **_properly_** attract a custodial penalty. It would not serve the ends of justice that Mr Chan Myae, her co-accused in the Food Junction charge should serve a ten-week sentence, while Ms Lai be accorded a high fine, while being the counterpart in the same criminal activity.

82     The sting of deterrence would be severely adulterated if the well-heeled can escape the appropriate consequences of their criminal conduct by paying a fine[^45]. To allow this might well breed a pernicious culture where criminals with the wherewithal to pay; expect that, when caught, their corrupt acts can be resolved by pecuniary penalties, and thus fines would be peremptorily treated as a _‘cost of doing business’_. It is plain that for deterrence in this context to be truly efficacious, sentences must be, within the bounds of fairness and proportionality, calibrated to a level where the **_costs_** upon discovery and conviction so **_outweigh_** the **_benefits_** that individuals and corporation would not be inclined to regard bribery as a rational or viable course of action to take in any circumstance. It is trite, but true, that a firm stance against corruption is needed, as this vice is insidious, and the temptation to gain a business advantage a constant one. If allowed to become pervasive, corruption can permeate all strata of society, and deleteriously alter the dynamics of trade, service and business dealings in a country.

83     This is particularly applicable in Ms Lai’s case where her bribes could not be said to have arisen from a **_temporal_** instance of lapsed judgment (which seem to be the case for the aforementioned cases of _Heng Tze Yong_ and _Thor Chi Tiong_), but an oft resorted tactic replicated no fewer than 15 times over four years.

84     Simply put, Ms Lai was paying bribes virtually on a **_habitual_** basis. The only effective and rational response to this must be to impose custodial terms, to exact an appropriate measure of both specific deterrence for Ms Lai to eschew from her insidious _modus operandi_, and general deterrence for those who might be similarly tempted to obtain business advantages by illicit and unlawful means to give pause.

### Deriving a fair and proportionate sentence

85     Having stated the bases for imposing a custodial sentence, I will now explain the manner Ms Lai’s individual sentences, and global sentence, were arrived at, beginning with the competing sentencing submissions of counsel and DPP.

### Counsel’s response to DPP’s sentencing submissions

86     Ms Lai’s lead counsel vehemently protested the prosecution's aforementioned sentencing position of a global custodial sentence of 24 weeks imprisonment, which would approximate 6 months’ imprisonment to be a ‘manifestly excessive global sentence’ when compared to landmark preceding cases[^46]. As mentioned above, the defence took the firm stand that Ms Lai’s offending should meet with no more than a fine in their first two sets of submissions[^47]. The possibility of Ms Lai’s offences meriting a custodial sentence was only elegiacally conceded in the defence’s final set of written submissions, which gracefully acknowledged this possibility ‘_lf at all, the present case has only gently crossed into the custodial threshold’._ Ultimately, in imposing a global 15-week term of imprisonment, I was of the view that Ms Lai’s offending merited a sentence somewhat farther beyond the alluded _‘gentle crossing’_ across the custodial threshold, but was not of the level of egregious criminality which would have justified the 24-month sentence proposed by the prosecution.

87     In addition to the points summarised above, counsel referenced the following cases to demonstrate that the proposed sentence of 24 weeks was unduly harsh.

88     Defence counsel first referred to _Public Prosecutor v Tee Fook Boon Andrew_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 192</span>, a private sector corruption case involving bribes paid which totalled almost $2.4 million in 80 separate payments over a six-and-a-half-year period from January 2003 to July 2009.The accused had entered pleas of guilt to 12 charges under Section 6(b) of the PCA, with a further 68 similar charges being taken into consideration. The total amount of bribes for the 12 proceeded charges amounted to $761,019.64. On appeal. The High Court enhanced the first instances sentences from four weeks to 10 weeks' imprisonment per charge and ordered the sentences of four terms to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 40 weeks' (or approximately 10 months’) imprisonment, with a fine of $180,000.

89     In _Public Prosecutor v Tang See Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 161</span>, the accused was convicted after a trial on five charges of corruptly receiving sums totalling $140,000.00 on five occasion for recommending subcontracting awards under colour of his authority as a contract manager. The first instance sentence of 3 months' imprisonment per charge, with two consecutive terms resulting in a global term of 6 months' imprisonment, was upheld on appeal, as was the penalty of $140,000.00;

90     ln _Wong Loke Cheng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR 522</span>, the accused, an executive director, was convicted after a trial for corruptly receiving a total of US$90,377 (S$157,255.98) as an unlawful consideration for recommending the charter of a vessel. The global sentence of 10 months' imprisonment, penalty of S$157,255.98 to estreat his ill-gotten gains was affirmed on appeal.

91     ln _Public Prosecutor v Ng Sing Yuen_ 120071 SGDC 203, the accused; a president of a shipping company, was convicted on 15 counts of corruptly receiving a cumulative gratification of $434.800 over a 4-year period from November 2000 and October 2004. The global sentence of 12 months' imprisonment and a penalty of $294,800 (with a default term of 12 months' imprisonment was affirmed on appeal.

92     The next referred case of _Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng Thor_ 12011\] 4 SLR 217 involved a chief executive officer and joint managing director of a public listed company, who had pleaded guilty to two charges under Section 6(b) of the PCA. The first charge related to Mr Ang agreeing to give an illicit 15 percent ‘kickback’ for purchase orders accorded to his company, which amounted to $97,158. The other charge concerned his giving a $50,000 bribe to secure the sale of machines. Mr Ang consented to another two charges concerning payments of $24,650 and $35,700 to be taken into consideration, in all amounting to payments aggregating at $207,508.10, The High Court set aside the non-custodial sentence of maximum fines of $100,000 on each charge, and instead imposed terms of 6 weeks' imprisonment and a further fine of $25,000 on each charge, deriving a global sentence of 12 weeks' imprisonment and an aggregate fine of $50,000.

93     Counsel sought to demonstrate that Ms Lai’s case, which involved five proceeded charges for bribes totalling $44,004.10, along with ten TIC charges, paled in comparison with the gratification amounts and factual matrices of the cases set out above, which had all been tested in appellate proceedings.

94     Counsel noted that the accused persons in _Tee Fook Boon Andrew_ and _Ng Sing Yuen_ cases had respectively committed their offences over a six and a-half and four year periods respectively. On this point I will again reiterate the fact that while the proceeded charges had clustered around the period 2014 and 2015, Ms Lai has had surreptitious illegal dealings with Mr Chan Myae dating from 2011.

95     Counsel further noted that the accused in the cases of _Tang See Meng_, _Wong Loke Cheng_, and _Ng Sing Yuen_ cases had claimed trial, and hence received sentences which would not have factored in the notional discount applicable upon a plea of guilt, and hence he submitted it to be ‘_clear that a global sentence of 24 week's imprisonment is a manifestly excessive sentence.’_

### Defence’s proposed sentence

96     Having taken the factual matrices and global sentences imposed in the cases he referred to, along with peculiar mitigating factors applicable to the instant case, defence counsel submitted that Ms Lai should receive ‘_a global sentence in the region of_ **_6 to 10 weeks imprisonment’_** as a fair and adequate’ punishment[^48]. The following is the proposed breakdown in respect of the individual charges[^49].

### Prosecution’s response to defence’s sentencing proposals

97     The learned DPP provided a number of cases contained in two annexures of her sentencing submissions; _Annex A_ and _Annex B_, which showed sentences imposed in preceding s 6(a)[^50] and s 6(b)[^51] cases, and which were demonstrated to support their view that the prosecution’s proposed sentences are consistent with the sentences imposed in the precedent cases.

98     The precedents sought to demonstrate that custodial terms of **_6 – 10 weeks_** were ‘usually imposed’ where the bribe amounts involved amounts of $10,000 or less; and thus the prosecution’s proposed custodial terms of 7 – 12 weeks for the charges involving _Food Junction’s_ Chan Myae (of ‘no less than $5,000’), and _Rodyk’s_ Alvin Aw (of $8,000 and $11,000) are _‘consistent’_ with the presented cases. By the same token, the proposed custodial terms of three and five weeks for the charge involving _Bodynits’_ Nicholas Kuik (of $1,300) and AKC’s Gavin Ho (of $2,500) were consonant with precedents showing that custodial terms of **_‘at least 2 weeks’_** would be ‘_usually imposed’_ where the bribe amount was in the region of $1,500. The learned DPP also submitted that the prosecution’s proposed global custodial term of 24 weeks for the aggregate bribe sum of $44,004.10 in respect of the fifteen charges across the four companies could be justified from the precedents set out, which showed custodial terms upwards of four months being imposed where the bribe amount ranged from $30,000 - $40,000.

99     I noted defence counsel’s submission to treat with caution the DPPs analysis of the aforementioned district court cases, where the sentences imposed were not tested by any appellate review. Against this concern, I can see that the DPP has taken the effort to place statements of facts, along with the sentencing schedules for the cases, which set out details of the proceeded charges, and thus allow an indexing of the sentences in the respective cases with the factual matrix to allow an assessment for the saliency of the particular case. Given that bribe quantum is just one variable (albeit an extremely important factor), within a factual matrix, it would not be particularly useful for the cases mentioned (which have their own distinct factual matrices) to be set out in detail in these grounds, just to make a broad observation on sentencing. I should make it clear that I have borne defence counsel’s caveats in mind in evaluating appropriate sentences for Ms Lai. I would accept that Annexes A and B do reveal a discernible contemporary sentencing trend that **_generally_** shows short custodial terms being commonly imposed for the respective bribe amounts set out, with an expected increment in sentence to correspond with the quantum of bribe.

100    The prosecution’s analysis and annexures in this regard therefore provide a useful **_reference_** point, especially where the defence has not produced a set of **_competing_** sentence submissions demonstrating that the proposed high fines or the significantly lighter sentences set out in their submissions have been given in recent cases with analogous bribe amounts and factual matrices. Having stated this, I should make it clear that Ms Lai’s actual sentences were computed from an analysis which included the peculiar facts of her case, and that her global sentence was arrived at after considering salient sentencing principles, which will be elaborated on below.

### Whether bribery in connection to the provision of IT services can be an aggravated form of corruption

101    In the mitigation plea[^52], counsel made an argument that (T)_he present case also does not involve any strategic industry to justify an increase in sentence. lntetech was purely a middle-man company involved in selling lT equipment and services to customers_.’ In her sentencing submissions, the DPP has highlighted the presenting hazards presented by the introduction of anti-competitive elements that are caused by acts of corruption, that is to say that acts of corruption would disrupt fair competition, and result in principals paying higher sum than they otherwise would.

102    I would take a different view to counsel’s broad brush assertion of an absence of strategic concern in contracts for Information Technology products or services. Other than the introduction of anti-competitive elements tending to interfere with fair competition, there is, in my opinion, an additional element to be mindful of when contracting parties engaged in Information Technology endeavours cease to deal ‘_at arms-length’_ or in an otherwise transparent manner. The court must take into account that IT contracts can encompass myriad sensitive areas including business-sensitive work-processes and databases. My view is that deterrence is especially relevant where the corrupt acts occur in the context of Information Technology contracts, as a party engaged in corrupt relationship with another party may find itself compromised and beholden as a result of their criminal acts. This would be especially concerning as such a beholden party, anxious to avoid discovery, might find it difficult to refuse, should the other side impose demands for sensitive information on databases or other classified information of clients or other third parties. The court is not alluding to Ms Lai having committed any acts of this nature on the instant facts, but that these potential vulnerabilities would, in my view, call for deterrent sentences for corrupt activities within this genre of corrupt dealings in IT contracts.

### Summary of sentencing considerations

103    In sentencing, I carefully considered the offence-specific factors including the extent of Ms Lai’s premeditation, the quantum in the respective bribes (being substantial in three of the charges, the substantial benefit (including an admitted net profit of some $78 000), her persistent offending (where she had committing 15 offences involving four receivers over four years), as well as aspects of the nature of the industry mentioned in the foregoing.

104    I have noted the offender specific factors, including Ms Lai’s achievement of having rehabilitated herself from a troubled childhood to a very successful businessman with 170 clients, her plea of guilt, disgorgement of profits, and her post arrest co-operation with the investigation. The court has to note, however, Ms Lai’s lack of remorse, as discerned by her abdication of responsibility for her crimes in the manner described in the foregoing parts of this judgment.

105     _Per_ the principles elucidated in the case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span>, I undertook a two-stage process of first determining appropriate sentences for each individual charge, and thereafter made the necessary titrations and calibrated to accord a just and proportional sentence. As mentioned above I was of the view that the global sentence of 24 weeks proposed by the prosecution was rather on the high side, when juxtaposed with the instant factual matrix and the matrices in authorities presented. While I considered the 7-week term suggested for the _Food Junction_ charge to be quite reasonable as a starting point (before possible adjustments for overall proportionality in consecutive sentencing), I was of the view that the proposed sentences of 9 weeks and 12 weeks for the _Rodyk_ charges, and 5 weeks for the _AKC_ charge to be rather on the high side. The 24-week global imprisonment term was derived by combining the _Food Junction_ (7 weeks), higher _Rodyk_ (12 weeks) and AKC (5 weeks) terms.

106    Conversely, I found the 6 to 10-week global range proposed by the defence to be rather lower than could be justified by precedent cases. Counsel had, in justifying their recommendation of a 4-week imprisonment for the _Rodyk_ charge involving a $11 000 bribe, pointed to the accused in _Ang Seng Thor_ receiving terms of 6 weeks’ imprisonment for higher bribes than the instant case after his non-custodial penalties had been set aside. This submission did not take into account the higher number of proceeded and TIC charges Ms Lai faced, compared to the two proceeded and two TIC charges in _Ang_.

### Sentences imposed

107    With all salient considerations in mind, I was of the view that a fair sentence for the _Food Junction_ charge for the bribe of ‘not less than $5000’ should be 6 weeks. Given the reiteration of the principle in _Gan Chai Bee Anne’s_ case that ‘_There is a well-established general principle that in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence_’[^53], I titrated the sentences for the _Rodyk_ charges to 7 weeks imprisonment for the charge involving the bribe of $8000, and 8 weeks’ imprisonment where the bribe was $11 000.

108    Conversely, I considered a fine of $1000 appropriate for the _Bodynits_ case as the offending conduct was less egregious. I was mindful of the fact that _Bodynits’_ Nicholas Kuik was not required to undertake a competitive bidding exercise (which obviated the aggravating element of a subversion of the procurement process), along with the relatively smaller quantum of the bribe. I considered a 4-week term appropriate for the **_AKC_** bribe despite the high quantum of the deal ($178 000) as Ms Lai did not appear to be the **_prime mover_** in this instance, and the bribe to secure insider information was relatively low in value. The arrangements had been principally managed by her employee; Mr Wilson Ong and his confederate Mr George Tan, even though the bribe of $2500 had been handed over by Ms Lai herself.

109    The imposed sentences are therefore as follows (with the highlighted sentences running consecutively).

110    The High Court in _Gan Chai Bee Anne_ has enjoined sentencing courts to impose consecutive sentences in a mindful manner so as to ‘_reflect the substance and totality of the offending conduct’_[^54] Accordingly, I ordered that DAC-922413-2017 (the _Food Junction_ charge), DAC-922417-2017 ( a _Rodyk_ charge) and DAC-922423-2017 (the _Bodynits_ charge) are to run consecutively, to yield a global term of 15 weeks’ imprisonment. The three sentences involve distinct transactions, which are separate in time with different counterparty entities.

111    In this case, I have striven to impose appropriate sentences, with consideration taken to formulate consecutive sentences to be a proportionate and condign punishment for Ms Lai’s offences. The sentences, in my opinion, have taken due regard of the totality of Ms Lai’s conduct, and it is patent that the final aggregate sentence of 15 weeks imposed is **_not_** substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Likewise, the effect of the global sentence imposed against Ms Lai is not one that is crushing or disproportionate to the nature of the offences committed. I do also believe that the final global sentence is entirely in keeping with her past criminal record and her future prospects.

### Bail pending appeal

112    Ms Lai is presently on bail pending the outcome of this appeal.

* * *

[^1]: It would be, in my view, unnecessarily repetitive to set out all five charges given their similarity in nature of offence and _modus operandi._ The admitted facts supporting all five proceeded charges will of course be set out in the judgment.

[^2]: Exhibit C1.

[^3]: Exhibit C3.

[^4]: Exhibit PS-1.

[^5]: As cited at \[3\](a) of Prosecution’s Skeletal Address on Sentence.

[^6]: See \[3\](a) of Prosecution’s Skeletal Address on Sentence. The defence has also admitted to a net profit of some $78 000 from the $44 000 in bribes..

[^7]: As discerned from the content of Mr Chan’s PG papers. No appeal was filed in this case by either party, and there are no grounds detailing the bases upon which the sentences were imposed.

[^8]: At \[4\] of Prosecution’s Skeletal Address on Sentence.

[^9]: Emphasis added.

[^10]: Please see \[5\] of Prosecution’s Skeletal Address on Sentence.

[^11]: At \[5\]-\[8\] of Mitigation Plea.

[^12]: Counsel indicated that Ms Lai had three other employees engaged in similar sales-related activities, and that these have never been implicated in any criminal activity.

[^13]: At \[9\] to \[11\] of the Mitigation Plea.

[^14]: The fourth charge

[^15]: At \[10\] (c) of the Mitigation Plea.

[^16]: At \[10\] € of Mitigation plea.

[^17]: At \[11\](d) of the Mitigation plea

[^18]: The 14th charge

[^19]: At \[12\] (c) of the Mitigation plea.

[^20]: At \[12\] (e) of Mitigation plea

[^21]: At \[13\] (c) of the Mitigation plea.

[^22]: The referenced ‘this’ being reason for bribing Mr Gavin Ho.

[^23]: The defence’s Second Addendum to the Plea in Mitigation. Both prosecution and defence were afforded a final opportunity to orally respond and sum up their most significant points on the day scheduled for hearing for mitigation and sentencing.

[^24]: It should be noted that Mr Nicholas Kuik; the involved party in the _Bodynits_ charge had told Ms Lai that he was not even required to obtain quotations and had been empowered to directly award contracts.

[^25]: ‘HR’ is used here as an abbreviated term for ‘human resources’, to reference the group within an organisation administering employment and personnel matters.

[^26]: The accused is said to have known _Food Junction’s_ Chan Myae since 2011, _Rodyk’s_ Alvin Aw since 2008 and _Bodynits_’ Nicholas Kuik since 2010.

[^27]: At 13(d) of the Mitigation Plea states: … (Ms Lai) refused (Mr Ong’s) suggestion and told him that he could not continue working in this way, as the company **could not afford: ** to keep making such payments… (Ms Lai) strongly suspected that it was actually (Ms Ong) who was suggesting this to the customers, and then coming back to (Mr Ong) to claim that it was the customer who had requested for it. \[Emphasis added\]The passage also shows that Ms Lai was by no means pliant to attempts to influence her, and quite capable to making independent strategic decisions in dismissing proposals she deemed deleterious to Intetech’s interests.

[^28]: As derived from the _Clarification Note on Sales Volume Figures_ tendered by the defence.

[^29]: _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, Third Ed, Vol II_,

[^30]: _Sentencing Practice at Pages 1355-1357._

[^31]: VK Rajah JA held in _Public Prosecutor v Ang Seng Thor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span> at \[64\]:\[64\] The District Court in Yeoh Hock Lam attempted (at \[24\]) to suggest a specific amount of gratification (viz, $30,000) below which the custody threshold would generally not be breached. On my part, I do not think the factual complexities of the sentencing process permit such a precise figure to be provided. **However, I agree that the amount of gratification is an important factor in determining whether the sentence should be custodial or not as it has a correlation with the harm caused by an offence: ** (see \[46\] above) **and the potential need to deter the creation of a corrupt business culture at the highest levels of commerce:** (see \[42\] above). {Emphasis added\]

[^32]: See \[20\] of _Public Prosecutor v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 117</span>.

[^33]: There is, of course, a well-established principle of broad **equivalency: ** of culpability between giver and receiver. See _Ang Seng Thor_ at \[43\] – \[45

[^34]: At \[4\] of the DPP’s _Addendum_.

[^35]: Defence counsel may have misapprehended DPP’s reference, which was with reference to the **extended: ** scope of the **parity: ** principle as expounded in _Public Prosecutor v Ng Sae Kiat and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 191</span>. Counsel had instead sought to argue that Intetech itself was not a criminal enterprise given the **scale: ** of its legitimate business.

[^36]: The entire exchange spans Page 37 line 15 to Page 38, line 10 of the Notes of Evidence.

[^37]: To recap, the categories are as follows: **First:** Where the receiving party is paid for conferring on the paying party a benefit that is within the receiving party’s power to confer, without regard to whether the paying party ought properly to have received that benefit. This is typically done at the payer’s behest.**Second:** Where the receiving party is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do, thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party. Such benefit typically takes the form of avoiding prejudice which would be occasioned to the paying party if the receiving party discharged his duty as he ought to have. This is also typically done at the payer’s behest.**Third:** Where a receiving party is paid so that he will forbear from inflicting harm on the paying party, even though there may be no lawful basis for the infliction of such harm. This is typically done at the receiving party’s behest.

[^39]: Magistrate’s Appeal No 9214 of 2016

[^40]: Another ‘giver’, a certain Thor Chi Tiong who had been convicted on a single charge of having paid a bribe to Ben Ong (at the latter’s solicitation), and also had his custodial term revised to a $35 000 fine on appeal in MA-9123-2016-01.

[^41]: Mr Chan Myae’s global sentence was 20-weeks’ imprisonment.

[^42]: At \[11\] of the Second Addendum to the Plea in Mitigation

[^43]: If the TIC charge is included.

[^44]: In the Addendum to Plea in Mitigation

[^45]: At \[34\] of the Mitigation Plea, counsel states: ln fact, for the years 2Q11 to 2015, lntetech's overall net profit was $957 392.37, while the amount of net profit from the contracts associated with the present charges are only $78,999.01…

[^46]: In the Second Addendum to the Plea in Mitigation..

[^47]: The Plea in Mitigation and First Addendum to the Plea in Mitigation (‘Mitigation Plea’).

[^48]: For completeness, counsel’s oral submission was (at lines 5-9 at page 37 of the Notes of Evidence) in respect of the global sentence, went as follows: (_The prosecution’s recommendation of a 24-month global sentence_) would be too high and would be crushing. And I will invite the Court to consider a much lower sentence. If Your Honour is not with me on 5 to 7 (_weeks_), then at the most, Your Honour, even 10 weeks for her, it’s going to be a significant punishment.

[^49]: Counsel did not provide any particular formulation for a global sentence, but had asked for only **two: ** sentences to run consecutively.

[^50]: **Annex A: ** featured the following s6 (a) PCA cases_PP v Sawant Mahesh Manohar_ (DAC 923530-2014 and others)_PP v Ong Seng Wee_ (DAC 921352-2015 and another)_PP v Koh Kian Wee_ DAC-937866-2015 & Ors_PP v Geow Chwee Hiam_ MA 19 / 2016; <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 139</span>\- where the sentences of 4 months per charge for bribe sums of $20 000, $30 000 and $40 000 was upheld on appeal.

[^51]: **Annex B: ** featured the following s6(b) cases, with attached schedules of offences and statements of facts: _PP v Tan Pit Koon_ (DAC-937919-2015 & Ors)_PP v Kang Leong Chuan_ (DAC-923225-2016 & Ors)_PP v Arron Soh_ (DAC-934624-2018 & Ors)

[^52]: At \[70\] of the Plea in Mitigation

[^53]: At \[42\], the principle was restated with two qualifications which do not apply in the instant case.

[^54]: Per CJ Sundaresh Menon at \[77\] of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_: \[2019\] SGHC 4277     Next, in my judgment, in addition to complying with the one transaction rule and the totality principle as elaborated in _Shouffee_ and _Raveen_, the way in which sentences are run should, as far as possible, reflect the substance and totality of the offending conduct. Where multiple offences are involved, the most appropriate mechanism for doing so is the consecutive running of multiple sentences…
