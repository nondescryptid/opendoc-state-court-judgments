Sentencing – Disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving license

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9047/2021/01.\]

24 March 2021

### Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun:

## Introduction

1       Mr Miguel Reuben Vivekananda (“the accused”), a 24-year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty and was convicted on the following charge:

> “.. are charged that you, on 15 September 2018, at about 3.17 am, along Serangoon Road, Singapore, being the driver of motor lorry YP8799X, did cause grievous hurt to Azman Bin Ninggal, by doing an act so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of others, to wit, by failing to keep a proper lookout when you were driving, thereby colliding into the said Azman Bin Ninggal, who was standing on the left side of the road, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed)”

2       I sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of five days and disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of two years.

3       The accused had served his term of imprisonment. However, being dissatisfied with my decision, he is now appealing against the order of disqualification. I hereby set out the reasons for my sentence.

## Punishment Prescribed by Law

4       The punishment prescribed under section 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) in the case of a negligent act, is an imprisonment for a term which might extend to two years, or a fine which might extend to $5,000, or both.

5       Section 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) provides that a court before which a person was convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, could also order that person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving license for life or for such period as the court might think fit.

## Statement of Facts

6       The salient parts of the Statement of Facts which the accused admitted without qualification are as follows:

> 1.    The accused is Miguel Reuben Vivekananda, male/ 24 years old, holder of NRIC: XXXXX224I. He was the driver of motor lorry bearing registration number YP 8799X at the time of the accident.

> 2.    The victim is Azman Bin Ninggal, male/ 54 years old.

> Facts Relating to MAC 906792/2019

> 3.    On 15 September 2018, at about 3.18am, the Police received a call that there was a road traffic accident along Serangoon Road, Singapore.

> 4.    Investigations revealed that on 15 September 2018, at about 12am, the accused had consumed alcohol when he was with a friend at Prinsep Street. He stopped drinking at about 1am. The accused’s friend went to Tekka to meet another friend.

> 5.    The accused later drove his lorry and picked his friend up at Tekka. The accused was driving on the second lane from the left along Serangoon Road and the victim was standing on the left side of the road with two other persons. The victim was waiting for a taxi at the material time.

> 6.    As the accused was approaching the victim, he failed to keep a proper lookout for the victim and collided into him. POLCAM footage showed that the accused suddenly swerved his vehicle to the left and collided into the victim, before swerving back to the right.

> 7.    The POLCAM footage also captured the collision took place at 3.17am. The victim had been standing at the same location on the road for at least 12 seconds before the accused collided into him.

> 8.    The accused stopped his lorry some distance away from the point of collision. He was later brought back to the scene by the victim’s friends.

> 9.    The Police and paramedics subsequently arrived at the scene. The accused was placed under arrest at the scene. The victim was conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital via ambulance.

> 10.    Based on the medical reports prepared by Dr Helen Mi Fang dated 13 October 2020, Dr Heng Wei Quan dated 12 October 2020 and Dr Kwan Yiu Hin dated 22 February 2019 and 24 June 2019, the victim sustained the following injuries as a result of the collision: (a) left closed proximal tibia and fibula fracture, (b) right parietal subarachnoid haemorrhage, (c) left eye subconjunctival haemorrhage and (d) haematoma and laceration on the left maxillary area (cheek).

> 11.    The victim underwent surgical fixation on 19 September 2018 and was hospitalized from 15 September 2018 to 26 September 2018. On his discharge, he was ambulating with the aid of a walking frame. He was reviewed several times at the Orthopaedic Surgery outpatient clinic and he still required a walking frame to ambulate. He was given hospitalization leave from 9 October 2018 to 27 March 2019.

> 12.    Based on his review on 26 April 2019, he was able to walk without any support. He is able to ambulate without any walking aid, and it is likely that he will not require a walking aid permanently.

> 13.    There were damages to the left mirror and the front left portion near the edge of the accused’s lorry. At the time of the accident, the weather was clear, traffic was moderate, visibility was fair and road surface was dry.

> 14.    By failing to keep a proper lookout and colliding into the victim, thereby causing him to sustain grievous injuries, the accused has committed an act so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of others, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 338(b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev. Ed.).

## Antecedents

7       The accused was traced but with offences that are not related to any road traffic offences.

## Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

8       The Prosecution had sought for an imprisonment term of one week with a disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of two years.

9       The Prosecution submitted that based on the sentencing framework as set out in the case of _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> (“_Tang Ling Lee_”), the present case would fall under Category 2 of the _Tang Ling Lee_ sentencing framework. The Prosecution was of the view that the accused’s culpability was moderate to high as he was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout of the victim on the road. The accused swerved his vehicle to the left resulting in a collision with the victim who was waiting together with his friends to hail a taxi. As for the harm caused, the Prosecution was also of the view that the level of harm caused was moderate as the victim required surgery to the fibula fracture and subsequent hospitalisation leave of about six months.

10     Given the above, the Prosecution was of the view that the custodial threshold had been crossed and sought a term of imprisonment of one week and disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of two years.

11     On the issue of disqualification, the Prosecution referred to the unreported case of _PP v Eric Gan Chye Hoe_ \[MA-9198-2019-01\] (“_Eric Gan_”) where the court had imposed a sentence of one week’s imprisonment and two years’ disqualification order on Eric Gan for colliding into a pedestrian who was jaywalking when Eric Gan was making a right turn. The victim sustained fractures to her face and rib and opted for conservative treatment. The victim was admitted for 29 days in the hospital and granted medical leave for more than a month. The Prosecution submitted that the facts in the present case were no less aggravating than Eric Gan and a sentence of one week’s imprisonment and two years’ disqualification order would be justified. Eric Gan’s appeal against his sentence was dismissed by the High Court.

## Defence’s Submission on Sentence

12     The Defence had sought a fine of $4,000 and a disqualification order for a period of less than 12 months in view of the hardship that will be caused if he was sentenced to a longer period of disqualification as he relied on his driving licence for his vocation to sustain himself and his family.

13     In the alternative, the Defence Counsel had submitted that if the court was not minded to impose a fine, the court is urged to impose a short custodial sentence of four days’ imprisonment. On the issue of disqualification, the Defence Counsel had tabled sentencing precedents where one week’s imprisonment term was imposed coupled with a disqualification period varying between 18 to 24 months.

14     I also noted that after the sentence was pronounced, the accused informed this court not to disqualify him from driving from all classes of vehicle but to permit him to retain his Class 3 driving licence as he needed it to earn his living.

## Sentencing Decision

15     In applying the sentencing framework for road traffic cases under s 338(b) Penal Code as set out by the High Court in _Tang Ling Lee_, I am of the view that the _level of harm_ caused by the offence and _the culpability_ of the accused in the present case are both moderate to high. Therefore, the case falls within Category 2 with an indicative sentencing range of one week to two weeks’ imprisonment term.

16     In terms of the harm caused, the victim was hospitalised for twelve days and he had discharged himself against medical advice. He was on hospitalisation leave for about six months and needed a walking frame to ambulate for a substantial period during his leave.

17     In terms of culpability, the accused was driving a motor lorry, a heavier vehicle than the normal sedan car. Thus, he ought to be more vigilant when driving such a vehicle which poses a greater danger to members of the public should any injuries be caused due to his negligence. The manner which he was driving was akin to that of a ‘sleepy driver’. He was oblivious to the presence of the victim who, together with his friends, was standing ahead of accused’s vehicle for quite some time prior to the collision. The accused had ample opportunity to avoid the victim but did not do so. Instead, he swerved left and collided into the victim before swerving right again without stopping his vehicle immediately upon contact with the victim.

18     On the issue of disqualification, I note that in the case of _PP v Ong Heng Chua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 388</span> (“_Ong Heng Chua_”) at \[58\], the court had observed that the period of disqualification was generally in the region of 12 to 36 months for reported s _338(b)_ road traffic cases.

19     As recognized by Menon CJ in the case of _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> at \[13\] – \[14\]:

> “A disqualification order combines three sentencing objectives: punishment, protection of the public and deterrence......**Where an offence reflects a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users and a lack of personal responsibility, there is a public interest in taking such a driver off the roads for a substantial period of time.** The aims of deterrence are also served by sounding a stiff warning that such drivers can expect a lengthy disqualification order. The disqualification order should therefore increase in tandem with the severity of the offence, whether or not it is also accompanied by a substantial fine or period of imprisonment.”

> (emphasis added in bold)

20     In the present case, the Accused’s culpability and the harm caused were both at a moderate to high level. As he was a relatively new driver, I did not attach much weight to his lack of driving antecedents. I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that it was equivocal whether accused rendered any assistance to the victim. I was also of the view that hardship caused to accused arising from his disqualification order which will deprive him from working as a delivery driver was not a mitigating factor as this was brought upon by his own negligence. One of the court’s main considerations in imposing an appropriate period of disqualification is to protect the safety of the public. Having regard to the totality of the circumstances of the present case, I was of the view that a disqualification period of two years is appropriate to achieve the sentencing objectives of deterrence for the accused and protection of the public.
