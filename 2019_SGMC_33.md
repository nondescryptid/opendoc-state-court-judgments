12 July 2019

### District Judge Mathew Joseph:

## A.   INTRODUCTION

1       The accused had claimed trial to one charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”) for outraging the modesty of the 22-year-old female victim. At the material time, the victim was the accused’s GrabHitch passenger. When contacted by the victim, the accused was assigned by Grab to fetch her by Grab car to her home in the Tampines area of Singapore.

## B.   BACKGROUND FACTS

2       The accused was unrepresented on the first day of trial on 19 March 2018. The trial was then adjourned on the second day of hearing as the accused was given a medical certificate indicating he was unfit to attend court due to his recent surgery for a leg injury. When the trial resumed for the second day of hearing on 1 Aug 2018, his Defence Counsel Mr S Radakrishnan had come on board to represent the accused. Counsel then made an application to recall the witnesses who had testified earlier during the ancillary hearing. The Prosecution did not object. As the accused was facing a serious charge, I exercised my discretion to allow the defence application to recall the witnesses. I will deal with the cross-examination evidence of the recalled witnesses in a later part of this judgment.

3       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the accused guilty and convicted him of the charge. He was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment. The accused has now appealed against his conviction and sentence. The Prosecution has also appealed against sentence.

## C.   THE CHARGE

4       The accused was convicted of the following charge -

> _MAC-909027-2017_

> _You are charged that you, on 13 July 2017 at between 2.48 a.m. and 3:46 a.m., inside a motorcar bearing registration number SKD2477T parked at the car park of Block 497J Tampines Street 45, Singapore, did use criminal force on one_ **_XXX (Victim)_** _(a then 21-year-old female), to wit, by squeezing her left breast, grabbing her buttocks, touching her waist and legs and rubbing his penis against her face (over clothes), intending to outrage her modesty, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354 (1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

## D.   THE OFFENCE

5       The offence of outrage of modesty is described in s. 354 (1) of the Penal Code as follows –

> Assault or use of criminal force to a person with intent to outrage modesty

> **354.—(1**)    Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

## E.   THE FIRST INFORMATION REPORT

6       On 13 July 2017 at about 3.58 PM, the Victim made a Police Report “I was been (_sic_) molested.” The incident location was given as 497J Tampines Street 45 Singapore 527497.

## F.   THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

7       The Prosecution adduced evidence from 12 witnesses, including for the ancillary hearing. A summary of the evidence of the key witnesses is as follows.

#### (i)   Evidence of PW1 SSI Seina Chin Sau Hui

8       SSI Seina’s evidence was largely formal, as she was the IO for the case. Through PW1, the Prosecution tendered the FIR G/20170713/2102 dated 13 July 2017 (P1), the accused’s Arrest Report G/20170714/2001 dated 14 July 2017 (P2) and a set of photographs relating to Changi Airport Terminal 2 Carpark Level 3 Section B (P3). SSI Seina also tendered a document which showed the vehicle records of SKD 2477T, which was the vehicle driven by the accused on 13 July 2017 and having IU Number 1121875158.[^1] PW1 also gave evidence that the vehicle belonged to a car rental company called Alltrust Rental.

#### (ii)   Evidence of PW2 Goh Hor Soon

9       PW2 was the Operations Manager of G Tech which provided HDB or private carpark management services. He tendered a document P5 which indicated the entry and exit movements of the vehicle SKD 2477T of the accused on 13 July 2017. The accused’s car was in the Tampines carpark for a total of about 58 minutes. His car had entered the carpark at 2.48AM and had exited at 3.47AM.

#### (iii)   Evidence of PW3 Mohammad Hudzaifi bin Dzulkifli

10     PW3 IO Hudzaifi was the initial Investigating Officer (IO) for the case. He had recorded a s. 22 CPC statement from the accused which the Prosecution sought to admit. The accused objected to the statement for being involuntary as a promise of probation was made to him by PW3 during the recording of the accused’s statement.

11     As the accused’s statement was being challenged, an ancillary hearing was held to determine its admissibility.

## G.   ANCILLARY HEARING

## The Accused’s Statement of 14 July 2017

12     The Prosecution sought to admit the inculpatory statement (“the Statement”) of the accused. The accused’s Statement P7i was recorded by IO Hudzaifi on 14 July 2017 at 1900 at Changi Airport Terminal 2 Carpark.

13     As mentioned earlier, the accused was _unrepresented_ on the first day of trial. The first day of trial on 19 March 2018 also saw the Prosecution calling some witnesses for the ancillary hearing. When Counsel came on board from the second day of hearing on 1 Aug 2018, Counsel was permitted to have these earlier witnesses recalled for further cross-examination. For ease of reference and where appropriate, I will set out the relevant evidence of these witnesses both on the first day of trial when the accused conducted his own cross-examination and the further cross-examination by Counsel conducted from the second day of trial from 1 Aug 2018 onwards.

#### (a)   The Accused’s version of events

#### (i)   Promise of probation

14     During initial cross-examination by the accused, IO Hudzaifi had testified that the accused was in the Bedok Police Division lock-up and had been brought to Changi Airport T2 Carpark on 14 July 2017 where the recording of the Statement took place.[^2] The recording commenced at 1900 and ended at 2010, a period of one hour and 10 minutes. The accused then continued his cross-examination of IO Hudzaifi on other aspects, including his seating position in the vehicle during the recording of the Statement and the presence of other Police Officers. At this point, the accused ended his cross-examination. The DPP then commenced and completed her re-examination. At this stage the accused asked whether he could ask a further question in cross-examination. I allowed his request as he was unrepresented.[^3]

15     The accused then conducted further cross examination of IO Hudzaifi. The accused asked IO Hudzaifi about the protocol for recording a statement from the accused inside an unmarked vehicle. IO Hudzaifi had replied that there was no protocol but that he had recorded the statement as the accused had decided to _open up and admit his offence_.[^4] The accused then moved to another area and asked questions concerning the seating locations of both IO Hudzaifi and himself during the recording of the Statement. The accused then ended his cross-examination and confirmed he had no more questions to ask in his further cross-examination of IO Hudzaifi.

16     Again and being mindful that the accused was unrepresented, I asked the accused to reconsider his position as this was his opportunity during the ancillary hearing, to ask questions pertaining to the voluntariness of the Statement recorded by IO Hudzaifi. [^5]

17     In response, the accused at this point suddenly put to IO Hudzaifi that he had promised him probation in return for him admitting to his mistakes. This was denied by IO Hudzaifi. The accused also suggested that SGT Isak had also offered him probation[^6]

#### Counsel comes on board to represent the accused

18     On 1 Aug 2018, Defence Counsel Mr S Radakrishnan came on board for the second day of trial. This was some almost five months after the first day of hearing on 19 March 2018. As a result of the further cross-examination of the witnesses who had appeared earlier on the first day of trial, Counsel now challenged the voluntariness of the accused’s Statement on new grounds set out below and as submitted in Counsel’s written submissions for the ancillary hearing.

#### (ii)   Oppressive conduct now alleged

19     As a result, the accused now alleged that the circumstances of the recording of the Statement P7 by IO Hudzaifi amounted to oppressive conduct.

20     In particular, the accused alleged that the Statement was taken while he was seated in the unmarked Police car in the car park lot at Changi Airport Terminal 2 Level 3. IO Hudzaifi was seated in the front passenger seat and the accused was seated in the left rear passenger seat. The only persons present in the car at that time were IO Hudzaifi and the accused. The 2 other police officers, SSSGT Muhammad Faizal Bin Haji Warin (IT-PW2) ("SSGT Faizal") and SGT Mohamad Isak bin Juma'at (IT-PW3) ("SGT Isak"), were standing guard outside the vehicle. It was undisputed that the accused was in grip restraints and was also seat-belted. The accused submitted that he was in an excessively restricted position in the rear passenger seat of the car while the Statement was being recorded by IO Hudzaifi. The accused also had to be assisted by IO Hudzaifi who held onto and supported the documents for the accused to sign as the stack of documents almost dropped off when the accused had attempted to hold on to the documents himself. The accused further alleged that the extremely dimly lit conditions would have impeded his visibility of the Statement. The accused also alleged that the handwriting of IO Hudzaifi in small block letters had also markedly made reading the statement in such conditions impossible. The accused also alleged that Hudzaifi's conduct in asking him to sign his Statement in these conditions was completely improper as an investigating officer.

#### (iii)   Threats now alleged

21     The accused now also further alleged that his Statement had been obtained as a consequence of threats made against him by Police Officers SI Terence Yong Boon Loong (1T-PW6) and SGT Mohamad Isak (1T-PW3). The accused specifically alleged that the threats made by the two Police Officers were as follows –

##### (a)    Threats by Station Inspector (SI) Yong Boon Loong Terence

22     SI Terence was part of the team of three police officers, including INSP Seow Ming Huat and SSSGT Darren Quek from Bedok Police Division who went to Changi Airport to arrest the accused on 14 July at about 4.00PM and then escorted the accused back to Bedok Police Division. The following threats, or words to that effect, were made by SI Terence to the accused during the journey from Changi Airport back to Bedok Police Division –

> Threat 1: "_Things would be worse for you if you do not admit to anything_."

> Threat 2: "_This is your last time to own up. If you're found guilty after DNA evidence is out, things will be so much worse for you_". [^7]

##### (b)    Threats by SGT Isak

23     SGT Isak was part of the team of 3 Police Officers from Bedok Police Division who escorted the accused from Bedok Police Division to the Carpark at Changi Airport Terminal 2 level 3 to procure photographs of the accused's rented vehicle that was parked at that location.

24     The following threats, or words to that effect, were made by SGT Isak to the accused during the journey from Bedok Police Division to Changi Airport Terminal 2 -

> Threat 1: _"If you did something, just say it lah. At least there is admission to something. This is better than no admission at all._

> Threat 2: _"If you do not say anything and you are subsequently found guilty, then there would be at least a 2-year sentence imposed."_

> Threat 3: _"This is your last chance to me, if you don't admit now, you confirm 'rabak_[^8]

#### (iv)   Inaccurate recording and non-compliance now alleged

25     The accused also alleged that his Statement was inaccurately recorded. He further alleged that there was non-compliance with the law by IO Hudzaifi when his Statement was recorded.[^9] He also alleged that the Statement had been concocted by IO Hudzaifi as he was in a hurry to complete his heavy workload of cases. I will return to this allegation in a later part of this judgment when considering the weight to be given to the Statement.

#### (b)   The Prosecution’s version of events

26     The Prosecution had submitted that IO Hudzaifi had testified that he did not threaten the accused or offer any inducement or make any promise to the accused. He specifically also denied that he had promised the accused Probation in return for the accused admitting to his mistakes.[^10]

27     It was also the Prosecution case that SGT Isak had denied that he had threatened the accused. SGT Isak had stated that he “totally disagree” with the allegation that he had threatened the accused.[^11] Likewise, the Prosecution submitted that SI Terence Yong had emphatically denied that he had threatened the accused. [^12]

28     As regards the allegation of oppressive conduct against IO Hudzaifi, the Prosecution submitted that the circumstances of the recording of the accused’s Statement by IO Hudzaifi did not constitute oppressive conduct.

29     In summary, the Prosecution submitted that the allegations of threats by the accused were an afterthought and were also unsubstantiated. The Prosecution further submitted that the various threat acts alleged by the accused objectively did not take place. In any event, even if they did occur, the Prosecution was of the view that these acts did not operate subjectively on the mind of the accused such that his Statement was rendered involuntary.

#### (c)   The Court’s conclusion that the Accused’s Statement P7 was voluntary

30     I was satisfied that the accused had made his Statement voluntarily.

31     With regard to the accused’s allegations of threats by SI Terence and SGT Isak, I noted that they gave their evidence in a forthright and candid manner. Both were also experienced Police Officers, each with more than 10 years’ service in the Police Force. Nor did they know the accused beforehand or had any reason to fix him. In the case of SGT Isak, he was candid enough to have admitted that when the accused told him he looked familiar, he had replied to the accused that his elder brother was known to the accused.[^13] SGT Isak then went on to “totally disagree” with Counsels suggestion that he had the threatened the accused three times during the period from the Bedok Division lock-up/holding bay area and the journey to Changi Airport. SGT Isak also emphasised that after he had told the accused that he was known to his brother, he would not possibly threaten the accused as this would reflect bad on him and his brother. [^14] I accepted unreservedly SGT Isak’s clear, candid and credible evidence.

32     Secondly, these allegations of threats came from the accused rather late in the day. I had observed him carefully and he did not impress me as a witness of truth. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s allegations kept changing and “morphing”. I had further noted that initially, the accused only alleged that his Statement was involuntary because IO Hudzaifi had promised him probation. However, when asked by the court to [^15] make use of the opportunity to ask all his questions while IO Hudzaifi was on the stand, the accused then blurted out “_What about from IO Isak_ .” IO Hudzaifi replied in the negative as regards any alleged promise of _probation f_rom SGT Isak.

33     Thirdly, on the first day of trial, the accused only mentioned that he had been promised probation by IO Hudzaifi. He did not mention expressly threats by SI Terence or SGT Isak. However, I did give some allowance bearing in mind that he was unrepresented on the first day of trial. At the same time, one would expect that between a promise of probation made by one Police Officer as against multiple threats made by two Police Officers, any threats would have been etched vividly in the memory of the accused.

34     Fourthly, there was no evidence of any complaint made by the accused about the misconduct of the two Police Officers who had allegedly made these threats against him. He did not make a Police Report against the two Police Officers after he was released on bail. Neither did he make a Police Report even after he was charged in court much later. This was not the reasonable actions of a person who had given an inculpatory Statement in relation to a serious charge of molest and who had signed the statement in 5 places. and who had declined to make amendments when invited to do so. [^16] I also note that IO Hudzaifi had testified that he only recorded the accused’s statement because he had “opened up.”

35     Fifthly, the accused was internally inconsistent with his allegation of threats by the two Police Officers. I noted that during cross-examination, the accused had claimed that he was not aware that IO Hudzaifi had commenced recording the Statement and further agreed that it was only after 14 July 2017, that he became aware that the Statement had been recorded.[^17] Yet, the accused was adamant that the threats emanating from SI Terence and Sgt Isak were still operating on his mind when he was being interviewed by IO Hudzaifi for the recording of the Statement. These two positions are patently inconsistent with each other. I therefore formed the view that the accused was prone to making up stories, especially when he was unable to explain his inconsistent positions. [^18]

36     I therefore concluded that the accused’s allegations of threats by the two Police Officers SGT Isak and SI Terence were not credible, unsubstantiated and false.

37     I turn next to the allegation of oppressive conduct by IO Hudzaifi. I note that it was undisputed that SGT Isak had entered the car and asked "dah?" [^19] to IO Hudzaifi who was about to get the accused to sign the Statement. SGT Isak had testified that he was supposed to end work at 6 pm usually. The accused had therefore submitted that this may have resulted in Sergeant Isak rushing IO Hudzaifi to complete the recording of the Statement. The accused had submitted that the urgency by which both IO Hudzaifi and SGT Isak had communicated had also caused the accused to hastily comply with IO Hudzaifi's instructions to sign on the document that the accused was given, despite not being able to read it. The essence of the accused’s allegation was that the circumstances of the recording of the Statement were so oppressive that it had sapped his free will and thereby rendering him incapable of giving a voluntary statement.

38     With regard to the above allegations, IO Hudzaifi was candid in describing the circumstances of the recording, including where the accused was seated and that he was in grip restraints. I had observed that he had readily admitted in cross-examination that he did not use the normal language of “no threat, inducement or promise” was given to the accused at the end of the recording of the Statement. He also readily admitted that he had used the word “oppression” instead of “inducement” and that he did not know the meaning of “oppression”. [^20] If at all, these were recording or procedural lapses and in my judgment, did not constitute oppressive conduct that the sapped the will of the accused in any way. Indeed, IO Hudzaifi had testified that he only recorded the accused’s Statement because the accused had “open up.”[^21] This certainly could not be the actions of a man whose will was sapped and thereby made him disclose events of the preceding day involving the victim and himself. On the contrary, this clear evidence by IO Hudzaifi of the opening up by the accused, reinforces my assessment that the Statement was given voluntarily by the accused. As such, based on the evidence that was led, I do not find that the circumstances of the recording of the Statement were oppressive and that it had had sapped his free will and thereby rendering him incapable of giving a voluntary statement.

39     As for the alleged promise of Probation by IO Hudzaifi and SGT Isak, firstly, this was denied by both IO Hudzaifi and SGT Isak in EIC. [^22]Secondly, when Counsel came on board and IO Hudzaifi was recalled for cross-examination, it was never put to IO Hudzaifi that he had promised probation for the accused during the recording of the Statement.[^23]Thirdly, I also note that the sole allegation of a promise of probation made by IO Hudzaifi and SGT Isak on the first day of trial had changed dramatically to an allegation of improper recording of the Statement on Day 3[^24], allegation of threats made by SGT Isak and SI Terence on Day 4 and a new allegation of _probationary warning_ by IO Hudzaifi on Day 6. Based on the evidence led by the Prosecution, I rejected these new allegations as being unsubstantiated and lacking in credibility.

40     I turn now to the final allegation concerning inaccurate recording, not giving a warning and non-compliance with the provisions of the law. Counsel had made much of these lapses by IO Hudzaifi during his cross-examination when IO Hudzaifi was recalled.[^25] It will be useful to set out here the relevant legal provision concerning admissibility of the accused’s statements. Section 258 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CPC”) states as follows -

> “258 (3)    The court shall refuse to admit the statement of the accused or allow it to be used in the manner referred to in subsection (1) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against the accused, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give the accused grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making the statement he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.

> _Explanation 1_—If a statement is obtained from an accused by a person in authority who had acted in such a manner that his acts tend to sap and have in fact sapped the free will of the maker of the statement, and the court is of the opinion that such acts gave the accused grounds which would appear to the accused reasonable for supposing that by making the statement, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him, such acts will amount to a threat, an inducement or a promise, as the case may be, which will render the statement inadmissible.

> _Explanation 2_ — If a statement is otherwise admissible, it will not be rendered inadmissible merely because it was made in any of the following circumstances:

>> ……………………………………………..

>> (c)     in answer to questions which the accused need not have answered whatever may have been the form of those questions;

>> (d)     where the accused was not warned that he was not bound to make the statement and that evidence of it might be given against him; or

>> (e) where the recording officer or the interpreter of an accused’s statement recorded under section 22 or 23 did not fully comply with that section.

> (Emphasis added)

41     It will be seen that Explanation 2 and paragraphs (c) to (e) in particular, have now expressly provided that the lack of a warning and other procedural non-compliance generally will not make a statement that is otherwise admissible, inadmissible merely because it was made in these circumstances. Where such procedural non-compliance prior to the enactment of the new CPC in 2010 would possibly have made the statement recorded in such circumstances inadmissible, it is clear that the position is now different under the new CPC. I therefore find that these procedural lapses cited by Counsel did not make the accused’s statement inadmissible in evidence.

42     I therefore find that the accused’s Statement was recorded voluntarily and admitted the Statement into evidence.

#### (d)   Weight accorded to the Accused’s Statement

43     I was mindful of the evidence given in the ancillary hearing. Under the provisions of s.279 (5) of the CPC, those parts of the ancillary hearing evidence relevant to the main trial can also be considered by the court as admissible evidence.

44     In this regard, the accused’s Statement P7 recorded under s.22 of the CPC had been admitted into evidence after the ancillary hearing. The Defence had submitted that notwithstanding its admissibility, the accused’s Statement P7 should be given little weight. Alternatively, it was also submitted by Counsel that its admissibility in court should be reversed as the recording officer PW3 IO Hudzaifi had met the Victim an hour before recording the accused’s statement P7.

45     I was of the view that Counsel’s argument was misconceived. To the extent that the underlying basis for this argument was that PW3 IO Hudzaifi had met the victim an hour before he recorded the accused’s statement and this was an issue which PW3 had denied several times during his earlier testimony given in court on the first day of the trial, I was of the view that PW3 had given a credible explanation for this discrepancy in his evidence. PW3 had, when he was recalled to the stand over this issue, stated that he had overlooked that he had met the victim earlier when she had come to Bedok Police Division to hand over the dress that she had been wearing during the molest incident. PW3 also clarified that he only had a short conversation with the victimPW3 and also went on to say that –

> _“Q_ _And so when she came to the Bedok Division, where did you meet her to collect this dress?_

> _A_ _From what I can recall, I met her at the counter area of Bedok North, uh, Neighbourhood Police Centre, Your Honour._

> _Q_ _Is it your evidence you were silent and she was silent or you spoke something?_

> _A_ **_From what I can recall, I met her very quick as I was preparing for other cases_** _. And what I can recall is I met her, I asked her for the seizure---eh, for the item and she hand over to me and I put up the acknowledgment slip and that’s where I just left after that, Your Honour._

> _Q_ _So you had a short conversation with her?_

> _A_ **_I had a short conversation with her, yes, Your Honour_** _.”_

> (Emphasis added)

46     I have also considered the contents of P7 carefully. It contained personal details of the accused’s family, including his father, stepmother and brother and his employment details. P7 also contained information about the accused being a part-time Grab driver and how he had received an earlier passenger at Woodlands. Further, it also detailed information on how he had picked up the victim at the Clarke Quay Taxi stand, including offering the victim a small pillow for her to use.

47     Such details as mentioned above, could have only come from the accused. In any case, it is trite that just because a witness was mistaken in one area of his evidence, it does not follow that the rest of his evidence which is otherwise credible, should for this reason alone be totally rejected.

48     I accordingly gave the contents of P7 due weight having regard also to the totality of the evidence of PW3.

## H.   MAIN TRIAL

### (a)   The Prosecution’s Case

#### (i)   The victim’s account of the incident

49     As a preliminary observation, it is well known that in most cases of sexual offending, there is no independent witness to the acts being committed, apart from the victim and the accused. And in all cases, the victim and the accused will have different versions of what happened. It then becomes the words of the victim against the words of the accused. It is then up to the court to assess whether the victim’s evidence is _unusually convincing_. The court also has to look for internal and external consistencies and inconsistencies. Further, the court also has to consider and rule on the issue of credibility of a witness and the veracity of testimony given in court.

50     The victim in her testimony, had given evidence to show that the accused committed the acts of molest against the victim while she was asleep in the accused’s Grab vehicle. The victim was clear in her account of the events that took place relating to the accused driving her home in the early hours of 13 July 2017. As indicated in the victim’s testimony, when the victim woke up, she was traumatised[^26] and shocked[^27] by the realisation that her head was on a man’s lap,[^28] the “driver seat was empty”[^29] and that she had already reached her residential block.[^30] At that point in time, it was already close to 4 a.m., the victim traumatised by what had happened, sent WhatsApp messages to her best friend PW5 Rachel and her then-boyfriend PW6 Jason to inform them of what happened. She then went to sleep as she had to reach work in less than six hours’ time at 10 a.m.[^31]

#### (ii)   Evidence of victim’s girlfriend

51     PW5 Rachel gave evidence that she had received WhatsApp messages from the victim on the day of the incident. She testified that around 3.00am, the victim messaged her that she had found a Grab driver and would be heading home.[^32] Later at about 4.00am, she messaged Rachel again to say she was home. The victim also told Rachel in her message that “_Then I think he touched me when I’m asleep.”_ The victim also told Rachel in her message that her Hitch driver was Malay but that she “woke up in a Chinese guy lap.”[^33] Rachel ended the chat at about 4.16am by telling the victim to rest well.

#### (iii)   Evidence of victim’s ex-boyfriend

52     PW6 Jason was the ex-boyfriend of the victim at the time of the incident.[^34] He gave evidence that the victim had messaged him about 4.00am to say she was home. This was also indicated in her WhatsApp text sent to him around that time [^35]

#### (iv)   Evidence of victim’s employer

53     It is not disputed that the person who played the key role in encouraging the victim to report the matter to the police was her then-boss, PW7 Ling. PW7 had given evidence that when the victim arrived at the office on 13 July 2017, he noticed that she appeared “breathless, tired”, “depressed” and “distressed”.[^36] He decided to ask her what was wrong.

54     The victim had initially remained quiet. PW7 testified that he kept persuading her to open up. The victim finally told him that she had been molested by her Grab Hitch driver – the accused. The victim told PW7 that when she woke up she found herself lying on the driver’s lap at the rear passenger seat.[^37] He then asked the victim if she had imagined it, and the victim unequivocally said she did not imagine it.[^38] PW7 then told her that if the accused had really outraged her modesty, he would definitely call her[^39] and that would show that “_there’s something fishy … about him_” and a police report should be lodged.[^40] Shortly after PW7’s conversation with the victim, the accused called the victim on her mobile phone at about 2:30 p.m.[^41] The victim was “very afraid and scared”[^42] by the accused’s phone call, she immediately placed the phone conversation on speaker and went to see PW7.

55     According to PW7, during the accused’s phone conversation with the victim, he asked the victim if she was “okay”. The victim appeared traumatised and sounded “very scared” of the accused and was intimidated by the accused’s phone call.[^43] After PW7 heard this phone conversation, he told the victim to take the day off from work and lodge a police report.[^44]

#### (v)   Evidence of Police witnesses given during the ancillary hearing

56     As for the other witnesses, PW3 SSSGT Hudzaifi had recorded P7 from the accused. He had given extensive evidence during the ancillary hearing concerning the recording of the accused’s statementP7. He was also recalled to give evidence for purposes of the main trial. I will refer to his evidence in a later part of this judgment.

57     The accused first admitted to the arresting officers, Inspector Seow (1-T-PW5) and Station Inspector Terence Yong (1-T-PW6) that he had touched the victim, when the accused was arrested on 14 July 2017 at about 3:20 p.m.[^45] The accused informed INSP Seow that he tapped the victim’s body with the intention to wake her up. INSP Seow then asked him which part of the body did the accused touch the victim and the accused informed it was the “breast and the buttock area”[^46]. When cross-examined by the Defence, INSP Seow maintained his earlier answer that the accused told him that he tapped the victim’s breast and buttock and he had the accused’s confession recorded in his field book.[^47]

58     SI Terence also testified that the accused was cooperative. He also testified that the accused was trying to tell him in details of what had happened during the incident after he confessed to INSP Seow that “he have touched the girl.”[^48]

59     I am mindful that there were some discrepancies in the evidence of these Prosecution witnesses. However, it is to be expected and almost inevitable, that when different people give an account of the same incident at different times, there are bound to be differences in the facts and details. But I am satisfied that these were **minor discrepancies** and not material contradictions. They therefore did not affect the Prosecution’s case. One such discrepancy was whether PW3 SSSGT Hudzaifi had seen the victim before he recorded P7 from the accused. The Defence had made much of the fact that Hudzaifi had stated some 8 times during the ancillary hearing that he had not seen the victim before recording P7. However, when D5 which was the Acknowledgement Slip that he had received the victim’s dress, was shown by the Prosecution to SSSGT Hudzaifi, he readily recalled that he had seen the victim briefly when she handed over her dress that she had worn at the time of the incident. He also admitted candidly that he was engaged with a lot of cases that day –

>   
| 

“A.

 | 

_Uh, your honour, as I look at this acknowledgment slip, uh, I can actually recall that on this day as I mentioned before_, _I was engaged with a lot of cases on that day itself__. So in regards to receiving the seizure items from the victim_, _it was a brief meet up where I took the item and after which I left straight to continue my follow-ups for the other cases and including this case_, _Your Honour.”_

 |

  
  

60     It is also trite that just because it is shown that a witness was mistaken in one area, this does not mean that his entire testimony is to be thrown out or that he is lying throughout his entire evidence.

61     I therefore accepted PW3 Hudzaifi’s explanation on this issue and also his overall evidence. I found him to be a credible witness.

### (b)   Case for the Defence

62     The accused elected to give evidence in his defence of the charge.

63     The accused denied the charge. It was a bare denial.

64     It was undisputed that the accused had as the assigned Grab Hitch driver, picked up the accused from the Clark Quay Taxi Stand. When she got into the car, from first impression and a glance, she looked drunk and also that she smelled strongly of alcohol.[^49] He also thought she wanted to vomit but she did not take a plastic bag that was offered. However, he gave her a pillow to rest her head on the left rear window of the vehicle. Sometime later, he arrived at the destination oh her drop off point. He noticed that she was asleep. He tried to wake her up by calling out to her, but with no response. He then tapped her right knee to awake her but got no response. He then got out of the vehicle to smoke a cigarette. He waited awhile and then decided to open the right rear door and tapped the victim’s right knee a few time with no response. He did this a few time. The he got out of the vehicle to have another smoke of his cigarette. After waiting awhile outside the vehicle, he decided to try to wake her again with more force. He then went bac into the car and shook her shoulders with some force, with no response. The victim stirred a little. So he decided to shake her shoulders again. The accused then claimed that the victim grabbed his left arm and hugged it tight. Subsequently, the accused claims that the victim leaned her head against his left shoulder. The accused said he felt uneasy and uncomfortable and decided to remove her arm. He then tried to remove his left arm. At the same time, he tried to lift the victim’s head out of his shoulder and to get out of the car. The accused stated that while attempting to do that, in that motion or in that struggle, he managed to get out of the grip. The accused stated that subsequently, the victim’s dead weight fell on to his left thigh, on his left lap while he was trying to get out of the vehicle.[^50] The victim was struggling to stand at this time. She then managed to get up. According to the accused, the victim asked where is the driver and he replied that he was the driver. The victim then retrieved her phone and left the vehicle. The accused then decided to go home.[^51]

65     During cross-examination by the Prosecution, the accused denied that he had committed the acts mentioned in the charge with intention to outrage the modesty of the victim. Specifically, he denied –

> (i) squeezing her left breast, (ii) grabbing her buttocks, (iii) touching her waist and legs and (iv) rubbing his penis against her face (over clothes), intending to outrage her modesty.

## I.   SUBMISSIONS BY PARTIES

#### (a)   Submissions by Prosecution

66     The Prosecution submitted that all the elements of the charge had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt and submitted as follows –

> (_i_)     _The victim was an unusually convincing witness_

67     The Prosecution submitted that the victim’s evidence was internally consistent and her account of the acts of molest remained unshaken under cross-examination.

#### (ii)   The victim had no motive to implicate the accused

68     The Prosecution submitted that the victim had no motive to lie and implicate the accused. It was submitted that both the victim, the arresting officers and SGT Hudzaifi also had no reason or incentive to fabricate allegations against the accused. It was further submitted that in the case of the accused, he made a bare assertion that the victim and SGT Hudzaifi possessed a motive which he did not identify, to concoct and fabricate allegations against him.

#### (iii)   Corroborative evidence of prosecution witnesses

69     It was noted that the victim’s clear, consistent and unwavering testimony was also corroborated by the accused’s confession to two arresting officers, INSP Seow (1-T-PW5) and SI Terence (1-T-PW6) and also as contained in his Statement P7. The Prosecution also submitted that the victim’s testimony was also supported by WhatsApp correspondences with her best friend, PW5 Rachel as contained in Exhibit P6 and her then-boyfriend, PW6 Jason in exhibit P8. Her state of distress was also observed by her then-boss, PW7 Ling. It was also submitted by the Prosecution that the accused had confessed to the arresting Police Officers ISP Seow and SI Terence that he had touched the victim.

#### (iv)   The post-incident actions of the accused

70     The Prosecution submitted that the accused had called the victim later in the day to enquire if she was alright. It was submitted that the accused’s denial that he had called the victim in the afternoon of the same day, was refuted by the contemporaneous messages sent by the victim to her best friend PW5 Rachel and her boyfriend PW6 Jason. The victim had notified both these two witnesses soon after the accused had called her at about 2.30pm on 13 July 2017. [^52].

#### (b)   Submissions by Defence

71     The Defence took a different view of the evidence and submitted that the Prosecution had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt for the following reasons –

#### (i)   The victim was not an “unusually convincing” witness and her evidence should not be relied on to convict the accused

72     The Defence submitted that the victim’s evidence was riddled with inconsistencies and was not consistent, cogent or credible. It was submitted that her evidence was inconsistent on whether she was intoxicated or tipsy. Further, the Defence also submitted that the victim was confused as to whether her Grab Hitch driver was a Malay or Chinese. It was also submitted that the victim herself was unsure of the incident when she sent a WhatsApp message to her friend Rachel and in which she said I don’t know what happen.

73     The Defence therefore submitted that the victim herself was doubtful of the accuracy of her recollection of the incident. This would render her testimony of the incident unreliable.

#### (ii)   The evidence of the Prosecution witnesses did not corroborate the victim’s evidence

74     The Defence submitted that the evidence of PW5 Rachel and PW7 Ling did not corroborate the victim’s evidence as the victim was merely relaying her self-complaint to the two witnesses. Moreover, both were unreliable and biased witnesses as they were closely acquainted with the victim.

#### (iii)   The WhatsApp messages from the victim to PW5 and PW6 should not be treated as independent evidence

75     The Defence had also submitted that the WhatsApp messages from the victim to PW5 and PW6 should not be treated as independent evidence and no undue weight should be attributed to the messages.

#### (iv)   The Court should reverse it earlier ruling on the admissibility of the Statement of the accused (P7)

76     It was submitted by the Defence that evidence given in the main trial showed that IO Hudzaifi who was the recorder of P7 was not a credible witness. It was therefore submitted that the Court should reverse it earlier ruling on the admissibility of the Statement of the accused.

#### (v)   The accused as a Grab driver was only trying to wake up a sleeping passenger and had no intention to molest the victim

77     The Defence had submitted that the accused was only trying to remove his sleeping passenger from his vehicle. He had no intention to molest the victim as he only wanted to get home as he had to work the next day.

78     In summary, the Defence emphasised that the accused was only trying to wake up his sleeping passenger. Seen in that light, it was submitted that it would be unsafe to convict the accused based solely on the victim’s testimony.

## J.   MY DECISION

79     In arriving at my decision, I have considered carefully the applicable law and legal principles cited by both parties, in arriving at my decision regarding the charge against the accused.

## K.   APPLICABLE LAW AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES

#### (i)   Convicting an accused person of a sexual offence based solely on the evidence of the victim

80     The Defence referred to the case of _Tang Kin Seng v Public Prosecutor \[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 44_ where the Court of Appeal held at \[43\] that there is "_authority to the effect that it is dangerous to convict on the words of the complainant alone_ **_unless her evidence is unusually compelling'_** Further, the Court in _PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syed Mal/ik <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span>_ at \[38\] referred to V K Rajah J's observation in _Chng Yew Chin v PPr <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 124</span>_ that –

> "…….given both the ease with which allegations of sexual assault may be    fabricated and the concomitant difficulty of rebutting such allegations", **the complainant's evidence must be "so unusually convincing as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration"on**

81     This was reiterated by V K Rajah JA in Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[45\] where he stated that _"a conviction can only be upheld if the testimony is so compelling to the extent that a conviction can be founded entirely and exclusively on it._

82     The Prosecution referred this court to the recent case of _Haliffie bin Mamat v PP and other appeals <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span>_ at \[28\]-\[29\], where the Court of Appeal endorsed the following understanding of “unusually convincing” testimony:

> _“In PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“Liton”) at \[38\], this court held that to be “unusually convincing”, the witness’s testimony must be “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case was proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence.” Elaborating further at \[39\], the court held that a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, “when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused”. As this court held in AOF at \[115\]_, **_the relevant considerations in determining whether a witness is unusually convincing are his or her demeanour, as well as the internal and external consistencies found in the witness’ testimony.”_**

> _It should be noted that the “unusually convincing” standard does not introduce a new burden of proof. It “does nothing... to change the ultimate rule that the Prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, but it does suggest how the evidential Gordian knot may be untied if proof is to be found solely from the complainant’s testimony against the accused” (XP v PP <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[31\], cited in AOF at \[113\])._

> (Emphasis added)

83     I also noted the more recent case of Kunasekaran _s/o Kalimithu Somasundara v PP <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 9</span>._ Although this was not a case cited by either party, the court found very useful guidance in the pronouncement by Chan Seng Onn J at paragraphs \[25\] – \[27\] –

> _“25_      _When a conviction is based solely on the bare words of the complainant and nothing else, the complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt on its own only when it is so “unusually convincing” as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration. In other words, if the evidence of the complainant is not unusually convincing, the conviction on the sole basis of the complainant’s testimony would be unsafe unless there is further corroborative evidence. See Pram Nair (\[14\] supra) at \[57\] and Haliffie (\[14\] supra) at \[27\] and \[30\]._

> _26_      _A complainant’s testimony would be considered “unusually convincing” only if the testimony, “when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused”. A trial judge evaluates whether this standard is met by weighing the demeanour of the complainant alongside both the internal and external consistencies found in the complainant’s testimony. See Haliffie at \[28\] citing PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> at \[39\].”_

> _27_      _Further, it is necessary for a court to assess all the relevant evidence when determining whether the Prosecution’s case is proved beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, a court, when considering whether the complainant’s evidence is “unusually convincing”, must “assess the complainant’s testimony against that of the accused”, such that the complainant is found to be “unusually convincing” to the extent that “the court can safely say his account is to be unreservedly preferred over that of another”: XP v PP <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[34\] per V K Rajah JA.”_

84     I next proceeded to evaluate the evidence offered by both the Prosecution and Defence with the above applicable legal principles at the forefront of my evaluation.

## L.   EVALUATION OF EVIDENCE

#### (i)   The victim was an unusually convincing witness

85     Having observed the victim giving evidence at the trial, I found that she was generally, a consistent and forthright witness and unusually convincing. In any case, much of the victim’s version of the incident itself and of the earlier part of the day in question, apart from the acts of molest, was largely undisputed by the accused himself.

86     I had observed the victim carefully while she was giving evidence. I especially paid attention to her demeanour while giving evidence. The victim was able to recount the acts of molest committed by the accused in clear detail. I also noted her evidence and perhaps found it not surprising that she could recall so many details. Further, at the risk of exposing herself, she also testified readily that she found herself relapsing into severe depression and requiring psychiatric treatment again after the acts committed by the accused on 13 July 2017.[^53] I am also mindful that her clear testimony was corroborated by the accused’s admissions to 2 arresting officers, Inspector Seow (1-T-PW5) and Station Inspector Terence Yong (1-T-PW6). Some of the acts of the accused were also repeated in his Long statement (P7). As mentioned earlier, her evidence was also supported by WhatsApp correspondences with her best friend PW5 Rachel in exhibit P6 and her then-boyfriend, PW6 Jason in exhibit P8. Her state of distress was also observed by her then boss, PW7 Ling.

#### (ii)   The victim’s evidence was internally consistent

87     During her evidence, the victim described the specific acts of molest committed by the accused. I observed that she gave her evidence in a frank and forthright manner. She was not hesitant nor was she over-eager in giving her evidence. I noted that she recalled the early part of the evening and the acts of molest in a matter of fact way. She testified that she had boarded the accused’s vehicle with registration number SKD 2477T at about 2:30 a.m. from the taxi stand at Clarke Quay and left for home. The victim testified that she entered the accused’s motorcar from the left rear passenger door, and also confirmed her location and that she was going home to Tampines.[^54] She testified further that after entering the accused’s vehicle, she had fallen asleep with her head leaning against the left rear window. She then recounted that while she was asleep, she could feel someone touching her all over her body – grabbing and squeezing her left breast,[^55] using light tapping motions[^56] to touch her waist, these touches then travelled down to her buttocks, touching and then grabbing her buttocks[^57] and then travelled down to her legs. All this narration was stated by the victim in a fairly unemotional manner. At this point, she also testified that she could also feel that her right cheek was lying on something that was “twitching” and she could “smell pre-cum”.[^58] She then recounted how these touches went on for a while. She also testified that when she finally managed to open her eyes, she realised that she was lying on a man’s lap. She then immediately sat up and saw that the driver’s seat was empty. She also noted that she was under her residential block.[^59]

#### (iii)   The victim’s evidence was credible

88     It bears noting here that the victim stated that she was confused as when she woke up, she found herself lying on a Chinese looking man’s lap. However, she testified that she was very sure her Grab Hitch driver was a Malay man. She then immediately left the accused’s vehicle and proceeded to reach her home. She then also decided to WhatsApp her best friend and her then-boyfriend at about 3:56 a.m. and 3:57 am as indicated in Exhibits P6 and P8 notifying them that she woke up in a “Chinese guy lap”[^60] and had been molested. She also testified that she then went to bed, as she had to work in less than 6 hours’ time at about 10.00 a.m.

89     I have recounted at some length the testimony of the victim to show that she was clear, generally consistent and not prone to exaggeration. At times, I could observe that it was clearly difficult for the victim to recall and repeat these acts of alleged molest. Nevertheless, she remained steady and forthright under cross-examination and came across as being fair in her testimony. Her account of the offences was unshaken even under extensive cross-examination. Nor did she deviate from her account, even as she readily conceded that she suffers from major depressive disorder with panic attacks, borderline personality disorder and bulimia.[^61] I am left in no doubt that it would have been quite distressing for the victim to disclose and talk of her medical ailments. Yet, I find that the victim’s refreshing candour was somewhat unusual, and that this further enhanced her testimony.

90     It would be apposite at this juncture to consider some examples of the victim’s unwavering testimony and its internal consistency under robust cross-examination and which bears out this theme of overall consistency. [^62]

#### (iv)   No reason for the victim to fabricate evidence

91     It was asserted by the Defence that the victim was prone to paranoia, exaggeration, illusions, disruption in memory or misperception due to her mental condition during the time of the incident. I observed that the victim did not falter under this strong insinuation that she was still unwell and therefore completely exaggerating her account of the incident. However, the victim testified that her major depressive disorder with panic attacks (depression), borderline personality disorder and bulimia,[^63] only causes her to have extreme mood swings but it does not cause her to hallucinate or have any illusions. She does not exaggerate things and she does not suffer from memory disruption or a misperception of things. She stated emphatically:

> _“I mean, when I know that something happen I will know exactly what happen. I won’t think that A is B or turn A into B”._ [^64]

92     In any case, I note that Counsel did not put forward any medical evidence or call a medical expert to give evidence to support his contention. I did not therefore accept Counsel’s bare assertions on this issue.

#### (v)   The victim was not hallucinating

93     A variation of the above argument was the defence assertion that the victim had consumed medication together with alcohol on 12 July 2017 to 13 July 2017. I surmise here that Counsel was accusing the victim that her mix of alcohol and medication had resulted in her having hallucinations.[^65] However, the victim testified that she had stopped taking medication as she was feeling better and she would definitely not take any medication when she went out for drinks as she does not want to mix her medication with alcohol.[^66] In my view, this exchange clearly reinforces the victim’s position that she was feeling better as she had just graduated, and had met her then-boyfriend and her career was going well.[^67] In fact, she was quite adamant at this point as I observed her, that she did not feel the need to take antidepressants or any form of medication.[^68] I found her responses in this exchange quite sensible, reasonable and credible.

#### (vi)   Victim was asleep yet aware of what was happening

94     In yet another instance of the victim being put under intense cross-examination, Counsel had responded that the victim was “dead asleep”.[^69] Again, the pointed assertion here by Counsel was that it must logically follow that the victim could not have been aware of the accused touching her inappropriately. I had observed the victim carefully during her testimony in court. She testified steadfastly that even though she was deep asleep, she was very sure that the accused touched her breast, buttocks, waist and legs.[^70] She can “feel” the touches.[^71] She also elaborated that even though she was a heavy sleeper, if her mother were to wake her up on a weekend, she can hear her calling but she wouldn’t be able to move her body and sometimes when her mother shakes her body, she -

> _“really can feel the shakes, I can feel the --- the calling and everything, but my body, my eyes are too tired to wake up, or like my body is really too tired to react. That’s how tired sometime_ (sic) _or how heavy a sleeper I am when it gets to that point. And that period around July, that period I was juggling with quite a few projects on hand for work, so it was really part of my busier---busiest period.”_[^72]

95     To put the above explanation in context, the victim then went on to explain that while the acts of molest were being committed, she could “_feel”_ that she was being molested, she was too tired to move, only when she finally regained her energy to move, she immediately sat up.[^73] When subject to even more intense cross-examination when Counsel told the accused that she should have been slapped by the accused to wake her up instead, the victim rushed to answer almost instantaneously that she would “…_would much rather take a slap from him, then to let him touch”_ her inappropriately.[^74] I find the victim’s answer here to be credible, spontaneous and convincing and above reproach.

96     Counsel as part of his duty to his client continued his focused cross-examination of the victim. It was also asserted that the accused was merely trying to wake up the victim as she was dead asleep. It was put to the victim that that she had forcefully pulled the accused’s hand and then collapsed on his left thigh. It would not have been unreasonable at this point, to expect the victim to react angrily to Counsel’s question. However, I noted that the victim instead gave a measured and temperate response that although she was a heavy sleeper, she would not move while asleep, and would only turn her head and not have any huge forceful actions like grabbing the accused’s hand,[^75]

> “…_I_ **_definitely would never go and pull his hand_**_. And then go and lie on someone…_ **when I’m sleeping, I’m just not moving.** **_Why would I go and pull his hand to lie on his lap?.”[^76]_**

> (Emphasis added)

#### (vii)   Victim could smell pre-cum

97     This was an unusual exchange between the victim and Counsel. Counsel had put to the victim that she could not have smelt pre-cum in the accused’s vehicle and the victim therefore had made a mistake.[^77] The victim’s response was that pre-cum smelt like “ammonia with urine that kind of mixture,” and it is the kind of chemical smell from hair dye.[^78] She candidly stated that she is familiar with this smell as she has had had sexual activities with her boyfriend.[^79] I pause here to observe that the victim was quite candid in this sensitive disclosure in open court and she did not seem in the least reluctant to have had to mention this fact openly.

98     For completeness, I also mention here that the accused in his defence had insisted that his motorcar had no “pre-cum” smell and the victim was mistaken. In response, the victim emphasized that when she had entered the accused’s motorcar, she did not smell this pre-cum smell. However, she could smell this pre-cum smell later while she was asleep and lying on the accused’s lap. Her evidence was unequivocal as she stated “_I only smell it because it’s close by to me, since I was lying on this (sic) lap”_. She also confirmed that after she had woken up, she did not smell anything.

99     I find this particular exchange and disclosure by the victim a further example of her credibility as a witness and the unusually convincing nature of her testimony.

#### (viii)   Victim also felt the twitching

100    The victim was also resolute and unyielding in her testimony at this point. She denied that when her head was on the accused’s lap, she did not feel a twitch on her right cheek but had instead only felt a “hard, aggressive push to his leg (sic)” which was given by the accused instead.[^80] In response, the victim testified that -

> **_“I definitely never feel that someone nudged his leg or anything._** **_I woke up because I could feel the constant twitching on my right cheek… and all the touches then so I finally gathered up the energy to wake up_** **_”._** [^81]

> (Emphasis added)

#### (ix)   Victim’s panic attack in court did not affect her testimony

101    It had transpired that the victim had suffered a panic attack the day before and also during her testimony in court. [^82] Counsel seemed to suggest that this episode may have affected the testimony that the victim gave in court. However, when questioned by the court, the victim had steadfastly maintained that her evidence in court was not affected. It was more a case of being intimidated while giving evidence in court. She further clarified that during the panic attack in court, her mind was not foggy and that it did not “_cock up my mind_.[^83] I was satisfied with her explanation and accepted that her testimony was not affected at all.

102    I pause here to add that it was necessary to quote at length the responses of the victim above. This was because the responses given by the victim were subject to my constant observation, assessment and evaluation. In my view, I find that from her robust answers above, it was apparent to me that the victim did not go out of her way to embellish her evidence with a clear aim to portray the accused as a fiend or in the worst possible light. Instead, she gave an unvarnished answer that she is familiar with the smell of pre-cum as she found the smell similar during her sexual activities with her then-boyfriend. I am mindful that this could even have been possibly embarrassing for her to state so openly and publicly and recorded as evidence in court. And yet the victim did not flinch from giving this evidence in open court. This was another example of her open candour which made her a credible and unusually convincing witness.

103    Against the background of the above extracts of the victim’s evidence, I am therefore of the view that she was most candid and did not seek at all to exaggerate her evidence. She came across as being credible and her testimony also had that ring of the truth. Her testimony was internally consistent. She also had no demonstrable motive to give false evidence against the accused. Nor was it put to the victim by Counsel during cross-examination that she had a clear expressed motive to implicate the accused. To merely submit that the victim was exaggerating the acts that took place in the rear of the Grab car in view of her mental condition, depression and intoxicated state is not the same as giving a clear motive for the victim to implicate the accused. In any case, as a matter of evidence, the Defence must adduce sufficient evidence of motive before the evidential burden shifts to the Prosecution. No sufficient evidence of motive was tendered by the Defence. I therefore find that these assertions of exaggeration by the victim, were mere after thoughts by the accused to try and exculpate himself.

#### (x)   Corroborative evidence of the Prosecution witnesses

104    There was other evidence before the court that also corroborated the victim’s version of events.

105    As regards corroboration, I am mindful that in the case of _PP v Mohammed Liton <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR ( R ) 601</span>_, the Court had considered the leading English case of R v Baskerville <span class="citation">\[1916\] 2 KB 658</span> at \[42\] which defined corroboration as "independent evidence implicating the accused in a material particular.” In this regard, PP v Mohammed Liton had also referred to the earlier case of _Tang Kin Seng v PP <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 444</span>_ at \[43\] which had put forward a more liberal approach when considering the existence of corroboration and had held that subsequent complaints made by the complainant can also amount to corroboration.

106    The issue was revisited and clarified further by Andrew Phang JA in _PP v Mohammed Liton_ where it was succinctly stated that -

> _"It is clear that the Baskerville standard does not apply in its strict form in Singapore since Yong CJ, in Tang Kin Seng (\[371 supra), advocated a liberal approach in determining whether a particular piece of evidence can amount to corroboration... The principle of law which emerges from these cases_ **_is that the local approach to locating corroborative evidence is liberal, thus ensuring that the trial judge has the necessary flexibility to treat relevant evidence as corroborative. What is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it js supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate.”_**

> (Emphasis added)

107    Adopting the above “liberal approach” as to what constitutes corroboration, I was aware that both Police Officers INSP Seow (1-TPW5) and SI Terence (1-TPW6) had given evidence of the accused’s admissions made to them at the time of his arrest in the afternoon of the same day on 13 July 2017. I noted that the victim’s testimony was also supported by WhatsApp correspondences with her best friend, PW5 Rachel as contained in Exhibit P6 and her then-boyfriend, PW6 Jason in exhibit P8. These were communications sent out contemporaneously by the victim to her friends. Her state of distress was also observed by her then-boss, PW7 Ling later that same day. I was therefore satisfied that this was corroborative evidence that was relevant. It was also supportive and confirmative evidence _that made the victim’s account of events more credible_ – see Andrew Phang J A’s comments in _PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Malik \[2008\] SLR(R) 601 at \[43\]_

#### (xi)   Lack of motive of the victim and Police Officers

108    It was undisputed that prior to the incident, the victim had never met the accused before and they were not known to each other. While the defence had in passing appeared to suggest a motive of imagination and constructing a story, this was emphatically denied by the victim. [^84] I also accepted that the arresting officers and SGT Hudzaifi all being experienced Police Officers, also had no reason or incentive to fabricate allegations against the accused. I would add that in the case of the victim, she actually put herself at risk of exposure, inconvenience and personal embarrassment by reporting the matter to the Police. As the defence did not show that the victim or the police officers had a plausible motive to lie or to frame the accused, the burden did not shift to the prosecution to disprove that motive – see _Goh Han Seng v PP <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR 374</span>_ at paragraph \[3 3\]

#### (xii)   Admissions and the accused’s statement P7

109    The accused had admitted to INSP Seow that he had touched the victim on her breast and buttocks area. [^85] INSP Seow had maintained this position also during cross-examination by the Defence. [^86] He further stated that he had made a diary note of what the accused had said in his field book.

110    Turning next to P7, the accused’s Statement had earlier been admitted into evidence after an ancillary hearing was held to determine if it was made voluntarily. The reasons for the court ruling that the statement was made voluntarily are set out in the earlier part of this judgment. I do not propose to repeat them here. However, I will proceed instead to deal with the contents of the Statement briefly at this point and only in relation to the Charge against the accused.

111    I am mindful that the accused had made several admissions in his Statement. The accused had in P7 admitted to kissing the victim’s forehead, that he had tapped her left waist a few times and also her left buttock area. He also admitted that he had used his left hand to grab and caress her left breast for a few seconds. I will return to this part of the judgment later when examining the accused’s defence and his testimony in court.

#### (xiii)   WhatsApp messages

112    As mentioned earlier, the victim on reaching home at 3:56AM, immediately told her best friend PW5 Rachel that she “_toh on a stranger_”.[^87] Further, at the same time at 3:57AM, she also messaged and told her then-boyfriend PW6 Jason that she “_woke up in a Chinese guy (sic) lap”._ The victim also mentioned that her Grab Hitch driver had touched her while she was asleep. Her emotional distress at what had happened was embedded in these WhatsApp messages. Reading through these messages, I myself could almost feel the anger and shock of the victim when looking at the WhatsApp exchange as set out below:

![]([2019] SGMC 0033_Image/[2019] SGMC 0033_image5.png)

113    In my view, the victim’s oral testimony in court had been clear and consistent. Considering further the above WhatsApp exchanges that she had with PW5 and PW7, I was left in no doubt that the victim was able to recollect accurately the events that took place in the early hours of 13 July 2017. Moreover, she had even candidly stated in her WhatsApp message to PW6 (quite incorrectly) that she “_woke up on a Chinese guy_.” When viewed against her otherwise strong recollection of the events that took place during that early morning Grab Hitch ride home, this frank but incorrect admission by the victim so soon after she reached home, does render her “very sure” recollection about the touches by the accused that much more credible. Contrary to what the defence had suggested about her recollection of the alleged acts of molest as being mere hallucinations, paranoia or exaggerations, I find that any confusion on the part of the victim was confined only to the moment that she woke up thinking she was on a Chinese man’s lap when her Grab Hitch driver was actually a Malay man.

#### (xiv)   Accused had called the victim the same day

114    I also note the evidence given by the victim that the accused had called her later in the same day when she was with her employer PW7 Ling. However, I noted that the accused in his testimony, had stated that this was not so, and it was the victim who had called him on 13 July 2017.

115    This is a curious assertion for the accused to make. First, I find this hard to believe as it is not only implausible, but also illogical for a molest victim to want to call her alleged accused so soon after the incident when she was still in a clear state of distress while recounting the molest incident to her employer. Second, no reason was given by the accused as to why the victim had called her or what was the contents of the conversation. Third, the accused’s story is clearly rendered untrue by the contemporaneous messages sent by the victim to her best friend PW5 Rachel and her then-boyfriend PW6 Jason. In these messages, the victim had been explicit in informing her friends via WhatsApp that _the accused had called her_ (Exhibits **P6** and **P8**). [^88]

![]([2019] SGMC 0033_Image/[2019] SGMC 0033_image6.png)

#### (xv)    Medical Report of the Victim by Dr Lim Chau San

116    The defence had tendered a medical report dated 23 March 2018 on the victim from Dr Lim Chau San of CGH. The victim had been seeing Dr Lim between September 2016 and January 2017 for suspected depression, low mood and panic attacks. She had started having these symptoms from the age of 12 years when she was a victim of bullying. Dr Lim’s assessment was that she suffered from (1) major depressive disorder with panic attacks and (2) borderline personality disorder. She also possibly had an eating disorder.

117    The victim had also been seeing CGH’s psychologist Mr Lew Zhen Wei until 25 May 2017.

118    Counsel in his cross-examination had referred to the last paragraph of Dr Lim’s Report which stated that “_Based on her last visit in January 2017, her prognosis is likely to be guarded in the light of her multiple co-existing psychiatric conditions, lack of good treatment response during the time she saw us, emotional instability and impulsivity, and maladaptive coping strategies.”_ The victim during re-examination by the DPP however had clarified that she did not really understand this last paragraph. She explained further by saying that she did not understand the phrase “_her prognosis is likely to be guarded in the light of her multiple co-existing psychiatric conditions…”_ In this regard, Counsel had been permitted with leave of the court at this stage when DPP Chee had closed her re-examination, to ask one more question as part of his cross-examination of the victim. [^89] Counsel whereupon put to the victim as follows –

>   
| 

_Q_

 | 

_“Your Honour, my last put to her, Your Honour._

_Witness, listen carefully, right? You can agree or disagree._ _I’m putting it to you that the evidence you gave against the accused in Court is a figment of the imagination as a result of your medical condition._

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

**_I disagree._**

 |
| 

(Emphasis added)

 |

  
  

119    It is evident from the above exchange that that the victim was clear and unshaken in her recollection of the incident involving her Grab Hitch driver on 13 July 2017. In my view, there was nothing in her answers or in her medical condition to suggest that her evidence was unreliable or a figment of her imagination as a result of her medical condition. I therefore rejected this submission by Counsel as being unmeritorious.

#### (xvi)    The Victim’s intoxicated state

120    Counsel had also submitted that in view of the victim’s intoxicated state upon entering the accused’s Grab car, she was not in a position to be able to describe accurately what had happened to her. I do not accept this assertion. The victim had given clear evidence that she may have been tipsy but that she was not intoxicated.

121    The victim had testified that she only had 2 free drinks: cranberry vodka at Attica and she did not drink any other alcoholic drinks in Zouk as they do not provide free alcoholic drinks. Her drinks were not high in alcoholic content. She recalled that it comprised mainly of ice and cranberry and that the vodka was quite “diluted”, as she could not taste the alcohol.[^90] She maintained that she was not drunk during the material time. Her friend PW5 Rachel had also confirmed that the victim did not drink the “extra bottle of alcohol” as she had “finished it up[^91]

#### (xvii)   The Victim’s mental condition

122    Counsel had also argued that the victim’s mental condition of major depressive disorder with panic attacks (depression), borderline personality disorder and bulimia meant that she was prone to exaggerating anything that happened to her. With respect, I do not accept this submission. First, it is tantamount to Counsel giving expert medical opinion from the Bar. Clearly, this is unacceptable. Second, Counsel could and should have called a Doctor or Psychiatrist to give expert medical opinion instead. This was not done. I therefore reject Counsel’s submissions on this aspect of the victim’s intoxicated state and the effects of her existing mental condition and the consequences of her ceasing to continue with her medication.

## Evidence of the Accused

123    I turn now to the Accused. What was the Accused’s story during the trial? Essentially it was one of bare denial.

124    To be clear, I did not find him to be a credible witness at all. He struck me as not being forthright in giving his evidence and even appeared as evasive on several occasions. I proceed now to cite a few examples of his answers that bordered between being inconsistent, irrelevant and totally evasive.

125    The DPP had cross-examined the accused on why he had had remained in the same position with the victim’s head resting on his lap without attempting to change his position. The accused in his reply stated that –

>   
| 

_Q_

 | 

_“At that point in time, the victim’s head on your thigh has put you in a difficult position, agree or disagree?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Yes, Your Honour._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Yes, thank you._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_You have, according to you, a dead drunk passenger lying on your left thigh in the car, in the wee hours of the morning, underneath her block, surely, the most reasonable thing for you to do is to immediately remove yourself from that position, do you agree?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Yes, Your Honour._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

**_Instead, you choose to remain in that position, continue to touch her and nudge her awake. That is surely, not reasonable behaviour? You agree?_**

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_No, Your Honour, the only reason why that---to quickly flit and---_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Quickly?_

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Flit, as in, get out of the car._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Flee---flee._

 |
| 

_Witness:_

 | 

_Flee, I’m sorry---sorry, Your Honour._

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

**_To quickly flee and get out of the car and make it look like, as though something was wrong is that bad_**. Then to say, for example, me as a driver, **_I also do not want to be seen as though I’m---damaging to my passenger_**. As in, not say, damaging, more to like, doing something to my passenger. Because I couldn’t touch, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t get help from incoming pet---incoming passer-bys at that point of time. **_So, I did within my means to try to get her up_** which is the last resort was to kick or nudge her on the head. I intended to call someone or maybe the police at---at the moment, but then, my---my phone dropped, Your Honour.

 |

  
  

> (Emphasis added)

126    The accused’s answer above to a direct question from the DPP is bordering on the illogical. He gives a long-winded and ambivalent answer that is evasive to say the least. The accused must have realized that he could not really answer that such behaviour was unreasonable as that would implicate him. Nor could the accused say that such behaviour on his part was reasonable, without being asked to justify his actions. I find therefore that the accused essentially was trying to fudge his answer.

127    The accused’s self-created quandary becomes apparent when the DPP follows up with another question –

>   
| 

“_Q_

 | 

_Do you confirm that, earlier_, **_you mention that you don’t want to be seen damaging your passenger by fleeing out of the car, correct?_**

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_I said that, Your Honour. But would it be possible to rephrase the whole sentence again?_

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_Follow what the DPP is saying, next please?_

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Okay_, **_so at that point in time you also mentioned there was no one else around to help you, correct?_**

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_To what I can recall, I turned around, there wasn’t anyone, Your Honour._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

**_So who will be seeing you damaging your passenger by---if they see you fleeing out of your car, since there’s no one else around, to the best of your recollection_** _?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Anyone can just come by passing by, you will never know._

 |

  
  

> (Emphasis added)

128    The accused’s answer above now becomes flippant. He must have realized that this was around 3.00AM in the early hours of a residential estate where most residents would be home asleep. So the accused grasps at the possibility of someone passing by as “_you will never know._”

129    The DPP continues with this line of cross-examination. The accused now becomes further entangled in his previous non-answers. This time the accused attempts to explain himself by asking for the question to be repeated after trying to explain his earlier answers by saying that –

>   
| 

_“Q_

 | 

**_You would agree that fleeing would be a immediate action and no one would be able to see what you were trying to do, right?_**

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_When I said “flee”, Your Honour, it refers to---at the same time little---the---the least of contacts with the victim, Your Honour._

 |
| 

_Court:_

 | 

_I do not understand. You need to be---Prosecution, if you don’t understand, can you ask the question?_

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_Can you please repeat your answer? What are---what are you saying?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_When the words---when---that I had mentioned “fleeing”, Your Honour_, _what I actually meant was to get out of the car at the same time to have the least of contact with the victim. At the same time, immediately, get out of the car. But the thing is, the dead weight was on my left thigh at that---at that material time, Your Honour._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

_So are you saying the dead weight meaning her head was on your left thigh and you couldn’t flee the car?_

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Okay, when---sorry Your Honour_, _my mistake on using the words “flee”, Your Honour__. So, what I had actually meant was, at the point of time is_, _because we try to be as delicate as possible when it comes to this kind of instances._ _So_, _because many a times, passengers were tend to complain at the slightest of things. So on our end, as drivers, we try to be very delicate and stuff. So we are on a very thin line on doing things._ _This, we cannot do---let---left, we could not do._

 |
| 

_Q_

 | 

**_So, if you are so concerned with complaints, shouldn’t you be more concerned that the victim’s head was on your lap and she would complain about that?_**

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Yes, it was a concerning factor at that moment Your Honour_ _._

 |
| 

**_Q_**

 | 

**_Isn’t that more serious than leaving the car immediately and letting her head rest on the car’s---the rear car seat instead?_**

 |
| 

_A_

 | 

_Sorry, Your Honour, can I have the question repeated?_

 |

  
  

130    In my judgment, it is quite apparent from the accused’s convoluted answers above that he had deliberately engaged in a meandering answer meant to shake off the DPP. When the accused realized however that he had backed himself into a corner, he desperately asked for the question to be repeated. Having observed the accused carefully in court and noticing also his demeanour in this specific exchange, it was clear that the accused was determined not to give a direct answer to the DPP, not just once but several times in cross-examination. I therefore find without hesitation that he was an evasive witness.

#### (i)   The Accused’s cautioned statement D 1A

131    Having regard to the above, I find therefore that the accused was an inconsistent witness, prone to giving ludicrous and illogical answers and he was also an evasive witness. His answers rang hollow and I did not find him to be a witness of truth.

## Totality of evidence before the court

132    I now evaluate the totality of the evidence of the Prosecution and the Defence. The following key areas were crucial in the court arriving at its final decision on the guilt of the accused.

#### (i)    The accused’s prolonged stay in the Carpark

133    It is not disputed that the accused reached the carpark of the victim’s Block at 2.49 AM and then left the carpark at 3.47AM. This was a total period of 58 minutes or almost one hour. For this entire period until she woke up, the victim was still asleep in the rear of the accused’s car. By any estimate, 58 minutes is a not a short time, but a long span of time. One can fly to Kuala Lumpur in that time.

134    During this prolonged period, and in his own words, the main objective of the accused was “_I got to get her out of the vehicle because the whole idea is to go home as I got to work the next day._”

135    What were the accused’s actions then to achieve his stated objective to get the victim out of the car? In his evidence, the accused said that he first called out to her “Miss, Miss,” Secondly, when faced with no response he tapped her right knee and said again, “Miss, Miss, you’ve reached.” Thirdly, still with no response, he turned up the radio volume with no success. Fourth, he then got out of the car, he did not want to open the left rear passenger door in case she fell out, as her head was leaning against the door. Fifth, he then smoked a cigarette. After his smoke, he went to the right passenger side this time and went in and tapped the right knee, and also called out to her several times. He was unsuccessful. Sixth, he then smoked another cigarette outside the car.

136    I have recounted the above actions of the accused in some detail. To be fair to the accused, I must state that up to this point, his actions cannot be faulted in any way or impugned. He was a taxi driver trying to wake up his sleeping passenger. He was therefore entitled to do so, with reasonable acts on his part. Even his acts of tapping the right knee of the sleeping victim several times were not acts of molest, as there was clearly no intention to outrage the modesty of the victim. The Prosecution does not dispute this either. However, it is what he does afterwards that calls his subsequent acts into question.

#### (ii)    The accused got into the rear seat of the car

137    When the above acts did not succeed in getting the victim awake, the accused decided _to get into the rear of the car where the victim still lay sleeping._ Even at this point, I was prepared to accept that the accused could have still innocently wanted to only wake up his passenger so that he could go home and get some sleep before going to work at 8.30am. I therefore accepted that nothing more was on his mind even at this point of time. Certainly, there was no intention to commit acts of molest at this point. But something happened to make him change his mind. Perhaps it was the opportunity that lay before him in the shape of a sleeping female passenger. Or perhaps in the accused’s own words in P7, “**_I could see her breasts cleavage area and the urge of touching her breasts came into mind._**” This was a fatal attraction. The accused then went on to carry out the acts of molest as indicated in the charge.

#### (iii)   The Accused’s admission to the arresting officer

138    I should state here that I also accept the evidence of the arresting officer Inspector Seow that the accused told him that he tapped the victim’s body with the intention to wake her up. Inspector Seow asked him which part of the body did the accused touch the victim and the accused informed it was the “breast and the buttock area”[^92]. When cross-examined by the Defence, Inspector Seow maintained his evidence that the accused told him that he tapped the victim’s breast and buttock and that he had the accused’s confession recorded in his field book.[^93] Clearly, the accused at this point of time _when he was already in the rear seat of the car_, his intention was not to wake up the victim but to molest her. I make this finding based on the facts as outlined above.

#### (iv)   The Accused’s long statement, D IA and his further admissions

139    The accused’s long statement P7 was recorded by PW3 SSGT Hudzaifi on 14 July 2017 at 1900 hrs. The accused had challenged the long statement for being involuntary. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearing, I admitted the statement. I do not propose to go into the reasons for admitting the statement again as I had already given my reasons earlier when admitting the statement into evidence during the trial. I had also given due weight to P7.

140    The earlier admission to Inspector Seow has also to be seen together with the admissions in P7. P7 was recorded a mere one day after the accused had carried out his acts of molest on the victim. What is also significant is that P7 is not a complete confession as the accused had denied certain specific acts, while admitting to other acts of molest. Further, P7 also contained details like the earlier part of the evening of 12 July 2017 which could only have come from the accused.

141    I therefore reject the defence submission that P7 was concocted by SSGT Hudzaifi as he was in a hurry, and have given the contents of P7 its due weight.

142    I am fortified in my view that P7 was not concocted or fabricated by IO Hudaifi as a comparison of P7 with D1A which was the accused’s cautioned statement is quite revealing. D1A was recorded by PW1 SSSI Siena on 21 September 2017, about a mere 2 months after the accused’s long statement P7 was recorded.

143    In D1A, the accused took great pains to deny any acts of molest. He specifically denied touching her left breast but stated that it might have been an “accidental touch.” He denied touching her buttocks saying that the victim had grabbed his arm and hugged it, placing it near her buttocks. He also denied kissing her forehead and stated that “her forehead had leaned against my lips when she was grabbing my arm with force.” An examination of these answers reveals that not only are the answers not credible, the answers are bordering on ludicrous. To say that his touch was an accidental touch of her left breast or that her forehead had leaned against my lips is simply fanciful and quite unbelievable.

#### (v)   Apology and offer of compensation

144    I also note that the accused had further stated in D1A that he wished “to resolve this matter soonest.” He also added that he “deeply apologise to the victim to have created such an awkward situation. It was never my intention to outrage your modesty.” The accused had also offered to make amends “through compensation if possible.”

145    I find that the above statements by the accused pertaining to his having created an awkward situation, his apology and offer of compensation to the victim, when viewed objectively, at the very least, tend to corroborate the victim’s testimony of the acts of molest committed by the accused. Simply put, there was no need to have called the victim the very next day and later even seek to apologise and offer compensation, if nothing improper had taken place in the accused’s car in the early hours of 13 July 2017.

146    In view of the above, it is evident therefore that the accused’s own cautioned statement D 1A, his admissions to the arresting officers, and his admissions in P7 to SSGT Hudzaifi when he “_open up_” cumulatively also corroborate the victim’s testimony against him. The evidence shows that these admissions were unsolicited and given spontaneously both to the arresting officers and SSSGT Hudzaifi, who were acting independently of each other, on separate occasions and under vastly different circumstances.

#### (vi)   Totality of evidence

147    Having considered all the evidence in its totality, I believed the victim and found her evidence to be credible and compelling. I found the victim to be truthful and that whatever minor discrepancies that were highlighted by the defence were nothing more than imperfect recollections of minor details and not deliberate lies. I did not find that the discrepancies, either on its own or taken together, would render the accused’s conviction to be unsafe. I am also satisfied that the victim did not and had no reason to frame the accused.

148    Ultimately, I also found the victim to be an _unusually convincing_ witness and that her evidence was also cogent, consistent and compelling. Her evidence was internally consistent. It was also externally consistent as indicated by her immediate recounting of the events of the carpark molest by WhatsApp messages to her best friend Rachel and her ex-boyfriend Jason, and also to her ex-employer Ling.

149    On the other hand, I did not believe the accused’s defence which was inconsistent when viewed against the totality of all the evidence adduced in court. His answers were unconvincing and his denial was bare and not supported by any credible evidence. Some of his answers at best were ludicrous, and at worse, displayed the shifting nature of his testimony and his evasiveness. One such example was his flippant answer “_Depends on the scenario”_ when asked in cross-examination why he did not flee or pull the sleeping victim out of the car.

150    In my evaluation of all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the victim’s evidence was unusually convincing and so reliable that a conviction based on her evidence alone could not be said to be unsafe. Further, when viewed against the totality of all the evidence before the court, the victim’s evidence now also had that ring of truth about it. In sum, the defence had failed to raise any reasonable doubt in my mind as to the guilt of the Accused.

## Verdict

151    In conclusion, I find that the Prosecution has proved its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

152    The accused is accordingly found guilty and convicted of the single charge against him.

## Antecedents

153    The accused is untraced.

## Mitigation

154    Counsel emphasised that the accused is of good character and unlikely to re-offend.

## Prosecution submissions

155    The Prosecution stated that there were aggravating factors in this case. The accused was vulnerable as she was unconscious and unresponsive. The psychological harm and trauma caused to the victim was significant as indicated in her victim impact statement. There was also abuse of a position of trust by the accused.

## Sentencing considerations

156    There are several aggravating factors in this case.

#### (a)   Degree of sexual exploitation

157    The accused had squeezed the victim’s left breast, grabbed her buttocks, touched her waist and legs and had rubbed his penis against her face. These were not one, but 4 separate acts of molest. The acts were not fleeting touches. And they were sustained and prolonged acts of molest. The accused’s car was in the car park for an entire 58 minutes. Even if the accused had taken 30 or even 50 minutes to smoke his 2 cigarettes, make his several attempts to try and rouse his passenger, or engaged in self-reflection as to what to do to try and wake his sleeping passenger, the remaining 8 minutes although not necessarily prolonged, were still a considerably lengthy period of time to carry out his deliberate acts of molest.

#### (b)   Circumstances of the offence

158    At the time of the incident, the accused was a part-time Grab Hitch driver. The victim had therefore placed her trust in him as a public transport driver to fetch her home safely. A taxi driver is clearly in a special position in relation to his passenger. This a privilege which comes with a corresponding high degree of responsibility. However, the accused here clearly abused his position and the trust reposed in him by the victim as her driver. He had cleverly exploited his sleeping and vulnerable passenger and had perversely and persistently outraged her modesty over a sustained period, to satisfy his prurient desires.

#### (c)   The victim was particularly vulnerable given her unresponsive state

159    The victim was vulnerable and entirely at the mercy of the accused as she was asleep and unresponsive. She was exhausted from work, had consumed alcohol and it was the early hours of the morning. The accused completely took advantage of her. When the accused saw the victim’s cleavage and entertained the urge to touch her breast, it was unfortunate. He had succumbed to the inviting sight of his sleeping passenger and seized the opportunity that lay before him in the shape of an unresponsive, dead-to-the-world female passenger**.**

160    As for mitigation, the accused is a first offender. I have noted his family circumstances. They do not disclose any exceptional mitigating circumstances.

161    At the same time, the accused had claimed trial and the victim had to come to court to testify and relive her harrowing experience. The accused was therefore not entitled to the usual sentencing discount which would have been given if he had pleaded guilty to the charge.

162    I am mindful the accused is a true first offender. He was recently married in 2018 and his wife was expecting their first child during the trial. He also has a supportive and close knit family, including his father and step-mother and 3 brothers. He has a good job and has shown dedication and professionalism in his duties as evidenced in a testimonial from his employer. He also has tertiary education and has been pursuing academic and vocational upgrading courses constantly.

## Observations

163    I pause here to make some observations on this case. I have noted earlier in my judgment that the accused did make several attempts to try and wake up his sleeping passenger. This was entirely the correct thing for him to do as a Grab driver or any taxi driver in a similar position.

164    I should add that this was also something that he was entitled to do with reasonable actions on his part. At the same time, this case highlights the need for all taxi drivers to be made aware of the appropriate actions to be taken when dealing with sleeping or otherwise difficult passengers. The safety of both the passenger and equally, also the driver, must be considered and taken seriously. It may be timely therefore considering the not insignificant number of incidents of molest cases involving victims who are taxi passengers, for the relevant Taxi operators and regulators to consider a _Code of Conduct_ for taxi drivers to observe and comply when dealing with difficult situations, especially that of sleeping, intoxicated or even emotional and difficult passengers. For example, it may have to be made clear that the best way to deal with a sleeping female passenger is to drive to the nearest police station or alternatively, to enlist the assistance of a third person. This will go a long way in promoting public confidence and reassuring members of the public, especially female passengers that they will not be taken advantage of and molested if they do fall asleep in a taxi after a late night out. At the same time, it also reassures taxi drivers that they will not be abused or taken advantage of by unreasonable passengers and that equally important, they will be protected by their employers from baseless allegations.

165    Here, it is also crucial to recognise that as a global city, we now have in Singapore, new ride hailing apps and even foreign operators entering the Singapore taxi market. With young and inexperienced persons becoming part-time drivers, there is an urgent need to ensure that they are well trained and also advised on how to handle awkward or difficult situations involving their passengers. As this case shows, there can be serious consequences for a driver who engages in improper actions to try to rouse a sleeping female passenger. This is especially so as Singapore has a vibrant night life, and there are also many women who work long hours and may return home very late after work or a late night clubbing session. The safety of both passenger and driver cannot be compromised.

## Conclusion

166    Public transport drivers provide a vital service. At the same time, their passengers are entitled to be treated with utmost respect and dignity and they should not be taken advantage of. It is necessary therefore in the public interest that the sentence imposed in this case, must also act as a general deterrent to other taxi drivers so that they are not minded to exploit and molest their sleeping passengers.

167    I am mindful of the multiple and specific acts of molest committed by the accused and also the abuse of a position of trust. It is clear however on the evidence and even the Prosecution has conceded this point which was raised by Counsel, that there was _no skin to skin contact of private parts._ I would readily agree that if this was the case, it would have been that much more aggravating and would have even warranted caning to be imposed.

168    Again, and contrary to what seemed to be suggested by the Prosecution, this was not a case where there was pre-mediation and planning in the sense that the accused had set out to molest the victim the moment she got into the Grab car. It was more of a case where the accused had “seized the opportunity” when he realised that he was unable to wake up the fast asleep passenger who was “dead to the world” . Indeed, as stated by the Court of Appeal in the case of _Pram Nair v PP <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> -_

> _“133_      _The PP characterises the appellant’s offence as premeditated because he separated \[V\] from her friends and took her away from the Wavehouse to the beach when she was in no position to resist his moves._ _We are unable to agree._

> _134_      _The Court in Terence Ng mentioned, as examples of premeditation, the use of drugs or soporifics to reduce a victim’s resistance, predatory behaviour such as sexual grooming, or the taking of deliberate steps towards the isolation of the victim such as by arranging to meet at a secluded area under false pretences (at \[44(c)\]). These examples reflect a high degree of deliberation and planning._

> _135_      _Here, by contrast, the appellant had not deliberately offered drugs or soporifics to \[V\] and had only met her for the first time at the party at the Wavehouse. We agree with the Judge’s assessment (at \[35\] of the Sentence GD) that the fact that the appellant plied \[V\] with alcohol had to be seen in the context of the party that they were there for. The appellant had offered drinks to others, and \[V\] had also accepted drinks from other people. It would not be fair to say that the appellant was targeting \[V\] specifically with the intention of getting her drunk._

> _136_      _It is true that the appellant might have distracted \[S\] by asking her to retrieve \[V\]’s bag so that he could take \[V\] away without \[S\] tagging along. But in the circumstances of the present case, as we have mentioned_, **_what happened appears to us to be a case of an offender seizing an opportunity rather than having acted in a calculated manner._**

> _137_      _This is all the more so when we compare the appellant’s behaviour with the kind of sexual offences that our courts have characterised as being premeditated. To take but a few recent examples:_

>> (_a_)     _In Ng Jun Xian v PP _ _<span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 933</span>_ _ (“Ng Jun Xian”), the victim wanted to return to the hostel she was staying at. The offender persuaded her to rest at a hotel and he reassured her that she would be left alone and allowed to sleep. After bringing the victim to the hotel room, he took the opportunity to sexually assault her. See Kee Oon JC observed that there was premeditation because the offender had “sought to set the stage by sending the victim to the hotel despite her initial reluctance and he took the opportunity when it presented itself to commit the sexual assault” (at \[42\])._

>> (_b_)     _In PP v Lee Ah Choy _ _<span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1300</span>_ _, the offender observed the victim for a period of time and came to understand her morning routine. He took the victim to a HDB block and even brought along a paper-cutter which he used to threaten her. Hoo Sheau Peng JC observed that this “demonstrated his resolve to see his plan through to completion” and that he did not commit the offence on the spur of the moment (at \[51\])._

>> (_c_)     _In PP v Sim Wei Liang Benjamin _ _<span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 240</span>_ _, the accused had used the internet with the clear intention of ensnaring his victims and luring them to engage in sexual activities with him (at \[30\]). This court noted in Terence Ng (\[_ _117_ _\] supra) that the offender had acted in a “predatory manner” (at \[55\])._

> _138_      _These examples_ **_show that the kind of premeditation which the law regards as aggravating an offence involves a significant degree of planning and orchestration._** _The appellant’s acts did not really involve any pre-planning. Before their meeting on that fateful day, they were strangers to each other._ **_It appears to us that the appellant’s moves that night were hatched on the spur of the moment”_**

> (Emphasis added)

169    Further, I was satisfied that with the positive and nurturing personal and family background of the accused, it was quite clear that the accused is not likely to re-offend in the future. In these circumstances, I did not think it necessary or appropriate to also order caning in addition to imprisonment.

## Sentence

170    Having considered the relevant facts, the accused’s mitigation and all the surrounding circumstances of this case, the accused is hereby sentenced to undergo 15 **months’ imprisonment** for the charge of molest that he was convicted on.

171    The accused is presently on bail pending appeal. The accused has appealed against his conviction and sentence.

172    The Prosecution has appealed against sentence.
