19 October 2021

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       From 1 February 2018, the Indonesian Embassy (“the Embassy”) in Singapore made it compulsory for all local employers hiring Indonesian foreign domestic workers (“FDWs”) to purchase a S$6,000 Performance Bond (“PB”). This allowed the Embassy to call on the PB for the benefit of the FDW in the event of any purported breach of employment conditions by the employer. In order to be allowed to sell these PBs, the insurers had to be accredited, and one Agus Ramdhany Machjumi (“Agus”), who was the Labour Attaché at the Embassy, was involved in this accreditation process. The charges against the accused persons allege that they were involved in an arrangement for gratifications to be given to Agus as an inducement to show favour in the accreditation process.

2       At the material time, Abdul Aziz Bin Mohamed Hanib (“Aziz”) was assisting Agus with various work at the Embassy, including translation work. Chow Tuck Keong Benjamin (“Benjamin”) was the one who introduced Aziz to Yeo Siew Liang James (“James”) and was charged with abetting by intentionally aiding Aziz to corruptly solicit gratification from James for someone from the Embassy, under s 5(_a_)(i) read with s 29(_a_) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) (“the PCA”).

3       James was an insurance agent and was charged with:

> (a)     eight counts of giving gratification to Agus as a reward for showing favour to his two principals, AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd (“AIG”) and Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd (“Liberty”) in the accreditation process; and

> (b)     10 counts of giving gratification to Aziz as a reward for arranging with Agus to show favour to his two principals, AIG and Liberty, in the accreditation process.

4       Aziz was charged with:

> (a)     eight counts of corruptly receiving gratification for Agus from James, as a reward for Agus showing favour to AIG and Liberty in the accreditation process;

> (b)     10 counts of corruptly receiving gratification as a reward for arranging with Agus to show favour to AIG and Liberty in the accreditation process; and

> (c)     One count of soliciting gratification for Agus from Loh Yeow Kwong David as an inducement for Agus to show favour to Tokio Marine Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd (“Tokio Marine”) in the accreditation process.

5       The charges were under s 5(_a_)(i) and s 5(_b_)(i) of the PCA, and the accused persons claimed trial to all of them.

6       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the three accused persons guilty of the charges and convicted them.

7       After hearing parties on sentencing and mitigation, I imposed the following total sentences on the accused persons:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="22.5%"> <col width="77.5%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Benjamin</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One month imprisonment and fine of $4,574.96 (in default one week’s imprisonment)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">James</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 months’ imprisonment and a fine of $21,363.30 (in default one month’s imprisonment)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Aziz</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17 months’ imprisonment and a penalty of $18,299.82 (in default one month’s imprisonment)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

8       All three accused persons have appealed against their convictions and sentences, and are currently out on bail pending appeal.

## Prosecution’s Case

### A summary

9       The Prosecution’s Case[^1] was that Agus was in charge of issuing accreditation to insurers for the PB. Instead of freely and openly giving accreditation to the 37 licensed general insurance companies in Singapore, Agus tasked Aziz to look for insurance companies or insurance agents who would agree to give them a share of the premiums collected in exchange for accreditation.

10     Through the intermediaries, one Samad Bin Salim (“Samad”) and Benjamin, Aziz found James, who represented AIG and Liberty, and who agreed to share his commissions with Agus and Aziz so that the insurers he represented would receive accreditation to underwrite this PB. Once James agreed to share his commissions, AIG and Liberty were both accredited to sell the PB.

11     AIG and Liberty sold over 5,700 PBs between February and June 2018. Acting on his own without the knowledge of AIG and Liberty, James corruptly gave a share of his commissions of around $124,619.26 earned from the sales of PBs in the following manner:

![]([2021] SGDC 0232_Image/[2021] SGDC 0232_image1.png)

12     The Prosecution’s case was that this arrangement was clearly corrupt. Aziz and Agus issued no receipts for the money they received, and payments were made entirely in cash stuffed in ‘vomit’ bags and envelopes. There was no evidence that the Embassy knew or approved of Agus receiving such share of the commissions.

13     In March 2018, Aziz and Agus asked one Loh Yeow Kwong David (“PW9 David”) and one Chew Yew Kuen Michael (“Michael”) for a share of premiums, in order for Tokio Marine to be accredited to sell the PB insurance. They refused to make such payments, and Tokio Marine did not receive accreditation from Agus.

14     In order to make out their case against the accused persons, the Prosecution relied heavily on the investigative statements recorded from all three of them.

### Benjamin’s investigative statements

15     Benjamin did not dispute the voluntariness and admissibility of his investigative statements[^2], and three of his statements were accordingly admitted into evidence.

16     The pertinent portions from Benjamin’s statements are set out below.

17     In his first statement dated 30 June 2018 at about 3 p.m.[^3], Benjamin stated the following:

> (a)     He first got to know Aziz in July 2017 through Samad’s introduction. Aziz told him that he was working with the Embassy to introduce PBs for Indonesian FDWs in Singapore, and he was working with a Labour Attaché in the Embassy to look for an insurance agent who could package the whole idea for them. Aziz asked Benjamin if he knew of any agents.

> (b)     Benjamin subsequently arranged for a meet up to introduce Aziz and Samad to James, who later arranged for meetings with AIG and Liberty.

> (c)     About two to three weeks after the meeting with AIG, Benjamin met up with James, Aziz and Samad. It was during this meet-up when James and Aziz started discussing about the sharing of James’ commissions from the premium of the PBs. James told Benjamin that he would give him and Samad a small cut of the commissions as “_referral fee_” as this was the “_usual industry practice_”.[^4] Benjamin vaguely remembered that James and Aziz were supposed to receive an equal percentage of about 5% while the remaining would go to Agus because “_they just said that they needed to cover someone from the Indonesia Embassy_”.[^5] There was subsequently a change in the percentages, but Benjamin was not involved in the subsequent discussions and not informed of the exact changes.

> (d)     When asked why Agus was given a share of the commissions, Benjamin stated that he did not know. To him, it was “_cover money for_ \[Agus\] _to allow AIG and Liberty to be the appointed insurers for the Indonesia Embassy bond_”.[^6]

> (e)     Benjamin received money on five occasions. The last occasion was transferred to him by Aziz. Otherwise, it was James or Samad who passed him the money. Benjamin did not know the breakdown of the PBs sold by AIG and Liberty as he was not informed by anyone. Benjamin was not involved in the operations and was “merely receiving money for referring James to Aziz”. This was a small cut given to him and Samad by James “_out of goodwill_”.[^7]

18     In his second statement dated 19 July 2018 at about 10.30 a.m.[^8], Benjamin stated the following:

> (a)     He knew Aziz was expecting commissions as Aziz did explicitly state so when he met Aziz with Samad, less than a week before he first contacted James on 23 October 2017. Aziz also mentioned that he was talking to AXA and had his options. Although Aziz did not say that if no commissions were given, the deal would be off, Benjamin and James “_understood that if_ \[they\] _wanted to get the deal, commissions would have to be given_”.[^9]

> (b)     Benjamin was asked to explain certain messages he sent to James, including one on 24 October 2017 at about 11.56 a.m. which read, “_Will confirm mtg. For this deal..we are working at embassy level and party commission will need to be covered from insurer side.._” Benjamin confirmed that the “commission” he was referring to was commission to be paid to Aziz and the group of people he was working with at the Embassy.

> (c)     Benjamin also told James “_something to the effect that if no commission is given to Aziz, the deal would be off since Aziz stated that he wanted to receive commissions and needed to pay someone from the Embassy_.”[^10] Benjamin also recalled telling James that it was “_common for people to cover each other in Indonesia_”. By “covering”, Benjamin meant “_giving money to do business in Indonesia_.” [^11]

> (d)     Benjamin admitted that he knew it was wrong to give someone in the Embassy money in exchange for awarding the accreditation to AIG and Liberty, and that this was a bribe. However, he did not think it through at that time and to him, “_it is how things work in Indonesia_”.[^12]

19     In his third statement dated 19 July 2018 at about 2.45 p.m.[^13], Benjamin was asked if he knew that the contact at the Embassy was Agus, and he said that he did not know it at that point in time, but heard the name “Agus” during casual conversations and during the profit sharing discussion. He later deduced that the person at the Embassy that had to be paid was Agus.

### James’ investigative statements

20     James did not challenge the voluntariness and admissibility of his first statement recorded on 30 June 2018 at about 12.45a.m.[^14] and his last statement recorded on 2 November 2018 at 3.45 p.m.[^15] However, he challenged portions of the rest of his statements, on the basis of an inducement given to him by Chief Special Investigator Chris Lim Eng Cheung (“PW3 Chris”).

21     In gist, James’ claimed that every time he tried to explain in the disputed statements that the commissions were paid towards the welfare of the Indonesian FDWs in Singapore in the form of Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) activities, this would be rejected and replaced in the statements with references to payments made to Agus instead. PW3 Chris had told him that their objective was against Agus, and not Aziz or himself. PW3 Chris also told him that he would be given a stern warning if he cooperated. On that basis, James then went along with the references to Agus in the statements.

#### Ancillary hearing for five of James’ statements

##### (1)   Evidence tendered

22     The disputed statements were recorded by investigation officers Mak Jia Yuan (“PW5 Mak”) and Lam Wai Chong (“PW6 Lam”). They gave evidence that all five statements were recorded from James voluntarily, and James had been allowed to read through the statements after they were printed out, and make any amendments he wished. There were handwritten amendments made to these five statements, and these amendments were made in James’ own handwriting. James had also signed against each amendment.

23     As James’ complaint was mainly directed at PW3 Chris, PW3 Chris was also called to give evidence during the ancillary hearing, although he was not a recorder of any of the statements.

24     PW3 Chris gave evidence that he met James at about 8 a.m. on 30 June 2018. This was after his breakfast and briefing with colleagues and while he was on his way back to his office. He passed by the interview rooms and saw that James was awake. As such, he decided to enter the room to have a word with James to ask him about certain discrepancies in the commission sharing percentages between James and Aziz’s accounts. As the lead investigator for the case, PW3 Chris said that he wanted to hear about the percentages from James directly. The interview lasted about 10 – 15 minutes and was not included in his investigation diary. PW3 Chris denied making any inducement to James during this interview.

25     James gave evidence during the ancillary hearing. His evidence was that he did not realise he was under arrest or investigation when PW5 Mak first came to invite him over to CPIB. He thought that he was simply assisting in investigations. PW5 Mak had told him that Aziz had been arrested and that the investigation was about Aziz. In addition, the fact that another witness “Ronnie”, who to his knowledge was not involved in the discussions over the PB, was also present at the CPIB past midnight, made him believe even more that he was simply there, like “Ronnie”, to assist in the investigations[^16]. James agreed that he was open to volunteering information from the start, and that the first statement (exhibit P27) was a statement he had voluntarily given to PW5 Mak. His only reservation about exhibit P27 was that he did not use the word “influence” at paragraph 9, and a “better word” would have been “recommend”[^17]. However though the statement did not contain his exact words, the contents were “more or less” what he said[^18].

26     After the recording of exhibit P27, PW5 Mak left him in the room for a long time. Sometime in the morning, PW5 Mak came in again and spoke to him. Someone then knocked and opened the door and PW5 Mak got up and said “Sir”, which created the impression on James that the person who walked in was a superior. The superior identified himself as PW3 Chris. PW5 Mak went out of the room, and PW3 Chris then immediately banged the table and shouted at James. James was shocked and started to cry. That was the first time that he felt that he was in trouble and that what Aziz did may have implicated him. According to James, PW3 Chris then told him to think about his children, and he also talked about Singapore already having a strained relationship with Malaysia and that the last thing they wanted was a strained relationship with Indonesia as well. He also told James that MOM was very unhappy with the Indonesian PB programme. PW3 Chris told James that their objective was to send Agus back to Indonesia and that they would not want to get James and Aziz, who were Singaporeans, in trouble. Finally, PW3 Chris told him that most of this would be swept under the carpet and he would just get a stern warning if he cooperated. PW3 Chris told him he would be given one last chance to put things right.[^19]

27     Soon after, PW5 Chris then left the room and PW6 Lam came in. James’ evidence was that even though he tried to tell PW5 Lam the truth that the 20% cut was for the purposes of CSR, this only agitated PW5 Lam who again reiterated that he had “one last chance”.[^20] Everytime he referred to CSR in the statements, PW6 Lam would change the reference to Agus instead. After having raised this a few times, James gave up and just went along with it. He explained that he did not want to risk losing his “last chance” and he was also induced by the promise of a stern warning by PW3 Chris. That was also the reason he did not choose to amend the offending references in his statements when given a chance to do so. Nevertheless, he maintained that those offending portions were not given by him voluntarily.

28     PW5 Mak’s evidence was that while he did not use the word “arrest” when he brought James back to CPIB, one of the first things he did in the interview room was to explain to James that he was here based on allegations made against him that he had given bribes.[^21] PW5 Mak also denied telling James that the investigations were targeted at Aziz.[^22] According to PW5 Mak, he was not aware that PW5 Chris has spoken to James.

29     PW6 Lam similarly gave evidence that he was not aware of what transpired between PW3 Chris and James on the morning of 30 June 2018, until a few months prior to the trial.[^23] He agreed that James had tried to claim that the 20% commission was paid towards CSR, but after a series of questioning when James could not give satisfactory answers, James also agreed that the 20% was not for CSR.[^24] He denied substituting all references to CSR with Agus in the statements.

##### (2)   Court’s decision on ancillary hearing for James’ statements

30     Having considered all the evidence presented in the course of the ancillary hearing, I was satisfied that there was in fact no promise or inducement made by PW3 Chris to James that he would be given a stern warning if he cooperated.

31     Apart from PW3 Chris’s denial, which I had no reason to doubt, I was also of the view that James’ claim of an inducement simply did not sit well with the other objective facts:

> (a)     At the time of the alleged inducement on the morning of 30 June 2018, PW3 Chris had already recorded a statement from Aziz which was quite detailed, and which incriminated the accused persons as well as Agus.[^25] In addition, the first statement recorded from James (exhibit P27) was also quite detailed, and James had already admitted to sharing his commission with Aziz as he wanted “_Aziz to help to influence the officials at the embassy_”.[^26] Bearing in mind this background, I did not see any reason why PW3 Chris would need to go around banging tables at 8 a.m that morning and dishing out stern warning promises or inducements.

> (b)     Having studied the contents of exhibit P27 (which was not disputed) against the other disputed statements, I did not find very significant differences at all between them such as to allow one to think that there might have been a "game changer” event in between the statements, such as PW3 Chris issuing the inducement.

> (c)     The contents of the statements did not read well if one were to simply replace all references to Agus to CSR. Some examples are as follows:

>> “20% was given to Agus because Agus was the Indonesian Labour Attaché and from what I understand, he would be the decision maker when it comes to the performance bond.”[^27]

>> “I wish to add that if I wanted to do this performance bond business with the Indonesian embassy, I did not have a choice but to agree to Aziz’s demand of sharing the commission with him, Agus, Samad and Benjamin.”[^28]

>> “I am asked to state if I have ever handed Agus’ share of his money to Agus personally on any occasion. I wish to say that I am aware that Agus was getting 20% of the premium for every performance bond sold but I have never handed money to Agus personally. Agus had never asked me for his share of the money personally or had any discussion on the payment to him.”[^29]

> On this level alone, this replacement claim was not at all plausible.

> (d)     When this was pointed out to him, James explained that it was the “essence”[^30] and not just the words. The problem with this explanation was that this “essence” was in the form of whole paragraphs or chunks of paragraphs. If James’ allegation was correct, then the investigation officers PW5 Mak and PW6 Lam must have completely fabricated whole portions of the statements. This was a very serious allegation to make of enforcement officers, and there was no basis in the present case to find that the officers had colluded as such. This also did not appear to be the case which was put to the officers on the stand, especially PW5 Mak who, according to counsel for James, had treated James in a “gentlemanly”[^31] manner. It was also not disputed that James was given time to and could make amendments to the statements if he wanted to. Again, this did not fit in with the allegation of the recorders fabricating the statements.

> (e)     There was no reference to a stern warning in James’ cautioned statements.[^32] I could understand why he might not have referenced it in his investigative statements, but when he was first informed that he would be charged, any reasonable person in his shoes would have been indignant and felt that he had been betrayed. One would have expected him to have either said something about it, or taken some action, such as demanding to see PW3 Chris. However, it was not disputed that James did nothing.

> (f)     James’ account did not sit well with the existence of his third statement (later admitted and marked as exhibit P29), which was entirely about the CSR. If, according to James, PW6 Lam had spent a few hours deliberately ignoring all references to CSR by James in his second statement (exhibit P28), why would he bother to go on to record exhibit P29 almost immediately after recording exhibit P28?

32     Having taken the above into consideration, I accepted the evidence from the recording officers in relation to how the statements had been recorded, because I found that their evidence was supported by the surrounding facts and circumstances. In contrast, James’ evidence and version appeared out of sync with the same.

33     Being therefore satisfied that the five disputed statements had been made by James voluntarily, I allowed the Prosecution’s application to admit them into evidence.

#### Contents of James’ statements

34     The pertinent portions from James’ statements are set out below.

35     In his first statement dated 30 June 2018 at about 12.45 a.m.[^33], which was not disputed, James stated the following:

> (a)     James came to know Aziz through Benjamin. Aziz informed him that the Indonesian Embassy was looking at implementing a PB for the employers of the Indonesian FDWs. Aziz wanted to know if James’ company could come up with a proposal.

> (b)     James spoke to the Head of Personal Line at AIG, Manik Bucha (“PW7 Manik”), who agreed that this was a good business opportunity. PW7 Manik also agreed that James would receive 45% commission of the premium of each performance bond that was transacted. The premium would be charged at $70, excluding GST.

> (c)     James then updated Aziz and shared with him that he would be given 45% commission. He also told Aziz that his commissions were taxable and that his actual take home was 35% commission. James shared this with Aziz as he felt that Aziz would “_want something in return_” for giving him this business, and he wanted to be transparent with Aziz about how much he was actually making out of this.[^34]

> (d)     Aziz subsequently told James that he wanted 29% of the premium for each transaction. James agreed to this request because it meant that he still got 6% premium which was better than the 5% he got from selling motor insurance. He was also willing to give a higher share to Aziz because he was the one who brought him onboard the business. He also wanted Aziz to help influence the officials at the embassy to accredit AIG.

> (e)     The product was approved by MAS in December 2018 and rolled out on 1 February 2018.

> (f)     James also informed the Head of Personal Line at Liberty, “Derrick Low” (Low Hwee Huan Derek) about this PB. Liberty was subsequently accredited in March 2018. Low Hwee Huan Derek (“PW8 Derek”) also agreed to give James 45% commission for every performance bond sold.

> (g)     James did not tell PW8 Derek, PW7 Manik or anyone else from AIG and Liberty that he was giving a portion of his commission to Aziz.

> (h)     James had passed the 29% to Aziz on about five to seven occasions in total. He would usually put the cash in a paper bag or an airline vomit bag. The last payment made to Aziz was on 29 June 2018 in the afternoon. He passed a sum of $6,806 contained in a vomit bag, to Aziz. James had never given any money to Agus, although he was aware from some of the text messages Aziz sent him that Agus had questioned Aziz on why the commission payments were late.

36     In his second statement dated 30 June 2018 at about 2.50 p.m.[^35], James stated the following:

> (a)     He met up with Aziz, Benjamin and Samad sometime in end 2017 or early 2018. Benjamin and Samad were the ones who had introduced Aziz to James. The meeting was to discuss the compensation that each of them would get from the implementation of the PB. During this meeting, Aziz mentioned that they needed to “_cover Agus_”. James knew that this was to be given to Agus so that AIG could have a higher chance of being an appointed insurer for the PB. James “_did not want to care too much_”, as long as he got 6% commission. They then agreed that Benjamin and Samad would get 1.5% each and Aziz and James would get 6% each. Agus would get 20%.[^36]

> (b)     At a meeting in December with Aziz and Agus, Aziz told James that Agus was “_fine with the 20%_”, and that “_that is the way it works in Indonesia_”. James understood that he had to cough up a sum of money to give to Agus because Agus was the decision maker.[^37] When asked how Agus could help in the accreditation, James answered, “I am not sure but since he is the Labour Attaché, I thought that he could make certain decisions.”[^38]

> (c)     James confirmed that the 20% was given to Agus so that AIG could have a higher chance of being accredited as the insurance company. He knew that this was wrong, and was a “_bribe_” to Agus.[^39]

37     In his third statement dated 30 June 2018 at about 6.00 p.m.[^40], James was asked to explain the term “CSR”, and stated that AIG and Liberty had decided to set aside $1 per PB to be used to contribute to events or activities held by the Embassy. However, the administrative details had not been worked out. James confirmed that the 20% commission given to Agus via Aziz had nothing to do with the CSR fund.

38     In his fourth statement dated 2 July 2018 at about 7.45 p.m.[^41], James produced the Statement of Accounts from Liberty and AIG and gave details on the commission amounts he would have received and shared with the rest. In particular, James stated that he was willing to give the shares to Samad and Benjamin because they helped to introduce Aziz to him. He was agreeable to give Aziz the 6% because Aziz was the person who knew Agus and without Aziz’s help, the PB business would not be successful and smooth-sailing. Aziz had a lot of influence over Agus and had convinced James that he would help James convince Agus to accredit AIG and Liberty. James confirmed that he wanted to do this business and he had no choice but to agree to Aziz’s demand of commission sharing.[^42]

39     In his fifth statement recorded on 5 July 2018 at about 10.20 a.m.[^43], James elaborated more on a meeting he had with Aziz, Samad and Benjamin sometime in late 2017 or early 2018, where they had discussed their respective compensations:

> (a)     During this meeting, Aziz told them that the Embassy, which James understood as Agus, needed to take “_the lion’s share_”[^44]. James did not object to this, and suggested a 20% cut for Agus. James did not know if Agus would share this with anyone else in the Embassy.

> (b)     The remaining 15% would be split evenly between Aziz and James at 7.5% each. James would cover Benjamin’s referral fees of 1.5% and Aziz would cover Samad’s referral fees of 1.5%.

40     In his sixth statement dated 19 July 2018 at about 10.30 a.m.[^45], James elaborated further on the payments he made to Aziz, including advances. James confirmed that everytime he passed Aziz the money, he would inform Aziz about the breakdown. James confirmed that he had never paid Agus money directly and would always pass the money to Aziz privately. He deliberately wanted to avoid handing any money to Agus personally as he did not want to have any monetary transaction with any Indonesian officials directly as he knew that was wrong and he did not want to be seen to be bribing Agus or any other Indonesian officials.

41     James also explained his text communications with Benjamin. He asked Benjamin in a phone conversation more about the “_party commission_” that he needed to cover and was told by Benjamin that he would need to pay commission to Aziz and his contacts at the Embassy if he got the business. James understood that if he was unwilling to pay Aziz and his Embassy contacts, he would not get the business to sell the PB.

### Aziz’s investigative statements

42     A total of five investigative statements were recorded from Aziz, and he challenged the admissibility of four of these statements on the basis of oppression.

#### Ancillary hearing for four of Aziz’s statements

##### (1)   Evidence tendered

43     The four disputed statements were recorded by PW3 Chris and PW4 Johnston Kan ("PW4 Johnston”). They gave evidence that all four statements were recorded from Aziz voluntarily, and Aziz had been allowed to read through the statements after they were printed out, and make any amendments he wished. There were handwritten amendments made to these statements, and these amendments were made in Aziz’s own handwriting. Aziz had also signed against each amendment. It was also the evidence from the recording officers that adequate food and drinks had been provided to Aziz, as well as smoke and toilet breaks.

44     In the course of the ancillary hearing, the Prosecution applied for the statements to be placed before the court, on the basis that the statements contained references to food, drink and rest which had been given to Aziz in the course of the recording, as well as substantive amendments made in Aziz’s own handwriting which would be relevant for determining his state of mind at the relevant time. Counsel for Aziz objected to the statements being put before the court during the ancillary hearing, on the basis of prejudice to his client.

45     Having considered the arguments put forth by both parties, I allowed the statements to be placed before me in the course of the ancillary hearing. There is no strict rule against the court having reference to a statement at the ancillary hearing. In _Sulaiman bin Jumari v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 116</span>, the Court of Appeal noted at \[85\] that the court was entitled to examine the contents of an impugned statement in its determination of whether it should be excluded or not, particularly in situations “where the allegations centred on the level of alertness and consciousness of the person making the statement”.

46     The references to food, drink and rest in the statements were clearly relevant towards the issue of oppression. I was also of the view that the amendments which had been made to the statements were relevant in determining the issue of Aziz’s state of mind at the time of the recording, which was another relevant issue to be determined at the ancillary hearing. I was acutely aware that the other contents of the statement were not relevant and should not be relied upon for the purposes of the ancillary hearing. The Prosecution was also careful to restrict their questioning of Aziz to only the relevant contents.

47     A chronology of the events that occurred in the course of recording these statements when Aziz was in custody, according to the investigation diaries of PW3 Chris and PW4 Johnston[^46] and their evidence in court, as well as the statements themselves, is set out below:

48     After Aziz was released on bail, he was contacted by PW3 Chris sometime on 2 July 2018 for a further statement. He came down on 3 July 2018 at about 10.30 a.m. and was interviewed for about 1 hour and 20 minutes by PW3 Chris before a further statement was recorded from him. This statement recording commenced at 12.50 p.m., and concluded at 5.30 p.m. (“the third statement”) Before this, Aziz was given lunch, as well as a smoke break and prayer break.[^48]

49     On 9 July 2018[^49], Aziz contacted CPIB to request for the return of his seized mobile phone, but was informed that investigations were ongoing. Aziz then requested for an interview as he recalled certain information. PW3 Chris subsequently arranged for Aziz to come back on 19 July 2018.

50     On 19 July 2018, Aziz arrived at the CPIB at about 9 or 10 a.m. He informed PW3 Chris that he had a swollen eye, but that he was able to proceed with the statement recording.[^50] A statement was recorded from him by PW3 Chris, commencing at 11.10 a.m. and concluding at 3.20 p.m. (“the fourth statement”).

51     On 24 July 2018, Aziz arrived at the CPIB on PW4 Johnston’s request. PW4 Johnston explained to him that they were going to visit several venues to take photographs, and Aziz agreed to cooperate. In the course of the trip, PW4 Johnston also noted down in his diary that Aziz informed that he needed to take antibiotic medication. After the trip to the various places, PW4 Johnston then recorded a statement from Aziz at about 2.20 p.m, concluding at 4.45 p.m. (“the fifth statement”) PW4 Johnston also confirmed that Aziz had access to water, as there was a water dispenser just outside the interview room.[^51] This statement was not challenged by Aziz.

52     Aziz’s evidence was that on 28 June 2018, he had returned from Jakarta at about 6 p.m. After briefing Agus regarding the work in Jakarta, he went home and slept at about 2 a.m. He woke at about 5 a.m. or 5.15 a.m. and went for prayers at the mosque. He had breakfast before 9 a.m. After breakfast, he went for Friday prayers at Sultan Mosque at Arab Street, and finished at about 2 p.m. Between breakfast and 2 p.m., he did not have anything to eat or drink. After prayers, he met James, and later went to Victory Restaurant for lunch. As he was ordering his food, he felt someone hit him on his back. He turned around and saw three people surrounding him and speaking to him harshly. They identified themselves to be from the CPIB, and asked him to surrender his possessions. They then handcuffed him and brought him out. The restaurant was crowded then, and Aziz felt “alarmed” and “terrified”.[^52] He also felt “humiliated”.[^53] He was brought to the CPIB office.

53     Aziz was then brought to a small room with a table and a bench. There were no windows and he could not tell the time as he did not have his watch with him. PW3 Chris then came into the room and asked if he knew why he was here. Aziz said no, and PW3 Chris then told him that “Our relationship with Malaysia is very bad. You trying to create problem for our government with Indonesian Government.”[^54] Aziz felt terrified on hearing this, as previously Agus had told him that the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) had called the Embassy asking for Aziz’s background.[^55]

54     During the interview sessions with PW3 Chris, Aziz felt stressed and his eyes were “burning” and in pain, as he had a condition of glaucoma for three years. Aziz also had a headache.[^56] During the interview, Aziz’s evidence was that he tried to provide an accurate statement but PW3 Chris did not want to accept it. That was why the interviews took very long. After the interviews, Aziz felt worried and exhausted, and the longer the interview went, “the less will \[he\] had”.[^57]

55     Aziz denied that a McChicken burger was given to him at about 8 p.m. on 29 June 2018, but seemed to agree that cup noodles was provided at about 1 a.m. the next day, although he did not eat it as he had never eaten that kind of food.[^58] Aziz also gave evidence that the only drink that was given to him was at 1 a.m. on 30 June 2018, together with biscuits and the cup noodles. He also did not manage to sleep as he was not used to sleeping in that condition.[^59]

56     When he was served “Chinese-style noodles” on the morning of 30 June 2019, he “sniffed” the noodles and was convinced that it was not halal. That “hurt” him, and he did not eat it, though he drank something and ate a bit of egg.[^60]

57     Aziz’s position with regard to the first two statements which were recorded from him when he was in custody, was that he felt stressed and weak as whatever he said had been rejected. He had no will left, and signed on the statements even though he did not agree with the contents.

58     With regard to the third statement recorded on 3 July 2018, Aziz’s evidence was that he was not informed that a statement would be recorded from him when he was told to come back to CPIB. He was merely told to surrender his passport. When he saw PW3 Chris on 3 July 2018, he felt “terrified” and “threatened”.[^61] He was afraid of a repeat of what had happened on 29 and 30 June 2018. As such, he “prioritised” his health and just wanted to return home.[^62] He signed the statement because he “did not have a choice”.[^63]

59     On 18 July 2018, Aziz obtained a medical certificate (“MC”) for two days from a polyclinic as his eye was swollen and his vision was blurred.[^64] On 19 July 2018, he asked PW3 Chris if he could come on another day as he was on MC, but this was disallowed. Aziz took a long time to read and understand the statement that day due to his eye condition, and he signed the statement because he was forced to do so.[^65] He denied that he had been asked to come down to CPIB on 19 July 2018 because he told PW3 Chris that he had further information to give.

60     When it was pointed out to Aziz in cross examination that he had made some amendments to the statements, his response was that he wished to amend the entire statement but he did not have the will to do it, and what he amended was what he managed to do.[^66] Aziz also agreed that he had informed PW3 Chris that he was hungry on 30 June 2018 at about 1 a.m., and that he had also asked for toilet and smoke breaks.[^67]

##### (2)   Court’s decision on the ancillary hearing for Aziz’s statements

61     Aziz’s objection to the four statements was on the basis of oppression.

62     On the evidence, I accepted that Aziz may not have managed to sleep for more than 24 hours when the first statement was recorded. The interview room he was in was always lit and there was no conducive space for sleeping properly. Even if he managed to catch some rest, it was only for short periods of time. I also accepted that the interview room was small and this would have added to his discomfort. The lack of windows or a clock would have been disorientating. It was also natural that Aziz would have been anxious and stressed, not knowing who might be coming in next and when and with what further questions or information.

63     Whether the questioning of a person had been oppressive and whether his will had “crumpled” was a question of fact (see _Seow Choon Meng v PP_ \[1994\] 2 SLR(R) 228 at \[34\]). However it is a high threshold to reach to find oppression such as to render the statements involuntary. In previous cases, offenders who had gone without food or drink for many hours were still not found to have had their will sapped such that they could not resist making any statement they did not wish to make. (See _PP v Tan Boon Tat_ <span class="citation">\[1990\] 1 SLR(R) 287</span>, and _Fung Yuk Shing v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 771</span>) One could be exhausted, hungry and unwell, but it would still require quite a leap from that state to a state where a person would simply sign anything, even if it criminally implicated him or her.

64     In the present case, I found several factors which showed me that Aziz had not reached such a state during the recording of the four disputed statements.

65     First, I accepted that Aziz had access to enough food and drinks to sustain him.

> (a)     This was recorded in the investigation diaries of both PW3 Chris and PW4 Johnston, as well as within the statements themselves. The diaries were clearly not complete. For example, the cup noodle break on 30 June 2018 at 1 a.m. was not recorded in PW3 Chris’ diary, but this food break was not disputed by Aziz. I was therefore unable to accept the argument made by counsel for Aziz that because drinks were not recorded in the investigation diaries, this showed that drinks were not given to Aziz at all. It was also the evidence of both recorders that Aziz had access to water when he needed, and there was a water dispenser just outside the interview room. He could have used it during his toilet or other breaks or he could have requested for water whenever he needed it. In fact, in giving evidence, Aziz did not seem to disagree with this point, and the lack of water did not feature much in his evidence.

> (b)     I also accepted that a burger was given to Aziz on 29 June 2018 at about 8 p.m. This was recorded in both PW3 Chris’ investigation diary as well as the first statement. There appeared to me no reason why PW3 Chris would fabricate this. According to the rest of the evidence it was clear that it was part of the practice by CPIB to provide meals during meal breaks and the burger at 8 p.m. would fit into that practice. I also could not see PW3 Chris as wanting to deliberately starve Aziz, seeing as how he did provide cup noodles and biscuits later when Aziz said that he was hungry.

66     Whether Aziz ate the food provided was a separate issue. Aziz claimed that he did not eat some of the food provided, such as the cup noodles and the Chinese-style noodles on the morning of 30 June 2018. If he chose not to eat it, that was his prerogative, but it could not lie in his mouth to say he was oppressed if he was provided with food and drinks and chose not to consume them. To make this choice, he might not have been very hungry. Whatever the reason, the fact was that he had the will to make a conscious decision not to eat something because it went against his beliefs. If he was indeed hungry, that meant that his will must have been very strong indeed.

67     Second, it was clear to me that Aziz had made lucid and specific amendments to his statements when given a chance to read them. This showed that he was still able to apply his mind when reading his statement “to correct the facts”.[^68] Aziz accepted that the amendments were made in his handwriting, which was neat and legible. I was of the view that a man who could still correct facts which were not true, was not someone who would sign anything given to him. I did not accept his explanation that he wanted to change everything but did not have the will to do so, as it did not make sense to me. If he could make one amendment, why could he not have made more? For the fourth statement recorded on 19 July 2018 for example, Aziz had taken one hour and 20 minutes just to read his statement and make the amendments.[^69] Clearly, CPIB was not restricting his time to read and amend.

68     Third, I accepted that Aziz had access to his previous statements before the recording of each statement. This is reflected at the start of the second and third statements, and some clarifications and elaboration had also been made to earlier statements in these later statements. For the third statement recorded on 3 July 2018 in particular, Aziz was already out on bail. At this point, there was no reason why he would have been too tired or exhausted to say something about his earlier statements if they had been completely untrue or something he had signed in a completely sapped state. The fact that he had access to these earlier statements but still did not reject or retract them, supported the finding that those statements were in fact voluntarily made by him.

69     Fourth, Aziz was already out on bail for the third and fourth statements. There was therefore even less basis to find oppression for these statements. Aziz would have been well rested and certainly more prepared. He was on MC on 19 July 2018, but I did not think that this alone meant that he would have had no will during the recording of the statement such that he would sign anything before him. I accepted the evidence from PW3 Chris that he had asked Aziz if he was still alright to proceed with the statement recording, and that Aziz had replied in the affirmative. Lunch was provided, and he was allowed to take his medication. This was not harsh treatment, and certainly not oppressive behaviour.

70     Bearing the above in mind, I was satisfied that there was no oppression in this case such as to sap the will of Aziz and render the four disputed statements to be inadmissible, and admitted them into evidence accordingly. His fifth statement recorded on 24 July 2018 was also admitted into evidence.

#### Contents of Aziz’s statements

71     The pertinent portions from Aziz’s statements are set out below.

72     In his first statement dated 30 June 2018 at about 2.20 a.m.[^70], Aziz stated the following:

> (a)     Sometime in September 2017, Agus contacted him to discuss the FDW issue in Singapore. They discussed the idea of providing more protection for the Indonesian FDWs working in Singapore via the PB programme, and Agus then told Aziz to get an insurance company on board.

> (b)     Benjamin introduced Aziz to James who was an insurance broker for AIG. Sometime in October 2017, Aziz met up with James and discussed the PB programme. He also went to AIG’s office to explain the product and informed them that they needed to make a presentation to the Embassy. AIG was eventually accredited in December 2017.

> (c)     Before the accreditation and sometime in October 2017, Aziz told James that he wanted to be in the team for bringing this product to AIG. He asked James how much commission he would be entitled to, and was informed that James would typically receive 20% to 25% of the premium paid.

> (d)     Sometime in February 2018, Aziz met up with Agus and James, and James told him that he would give Aziz 9% of the commission he earned from AIG, as he was earning 35% after deduction of income tax. James also told Agus that he would give 14% to 15% of his commission to Agus.

> (e)     When asked why James would want to give part of his commission to Agus, Aziz informed that James had told him a “_covered up story_” that he wanted to contribute it to Agus for CSR. However, this could not be true as the CSR being discussed during the meetings would be paid in a lump sum to the Embassy and directly by AIG. Therefore, James must have given the commission to Agus as Agus had helped AIG to be accredited to sell the PB. [^71]

> (f)     Sometime in March 2018, Liberty was also accredited to sell the PB.

> (g)     Sometime in April 2018, James gave Aziz his first commission pay outs. In the same month, James met up with Aziz and Agus, and handed an envelope to Aziz when Agus stepped out for a smoke break. He asked Aziz to pass the envelope containing cash to Agus as he was not comfortable doing it himself. Aziz did not know the exact amount which was in the envelope, and handed it to Agus, informing Agus that the money was from the two of them. Agus accepted the money and put it into his bag.

> (h)     When asked why he thought James was uncomfortable giving the money directly to Agus, Aziz stated that James did not want to be seen to be bribing Agus. Aziz was also not comfortable but as James insisted, he helped to pass the money to Agus[^72].

> (i)     Sometime in April 2018, James told Aziz that he would also receive commission for the Liberty PBs, and that similar to AIG, he would give Aziz 9% of the commission.

> (j)     On 28 June 2018, Aziz met up with James and Agus. James passed him an envelope and said that he had reached his withdrawal limit and could not give Aziz his share of the commission. Based on this, Aziz passed the envelope to Agus in the presence of James. He did not know how much was in the envelope then, but came to know of it the following day when James messaged him the breakdown - $8,000 for Agus and $6,806.82 for him. On 29 June 2018, James handed over to him an envelope containing money. Aziz did not count the money, but assumed it would contain $6,807 as per James’ message.

> (k)     Shortly after this, Aziz was arrested.[^73]

73     In his second statement dated 30 June 2018 at about 3.15 p.m.[^74], Aziz stated the following:

> (a)     When he met Agus in September 2017, Agus told him that he “_would want a cut from this PB_”.[^75]

> (b)     During a second meeting with James, Benjamin and Samad, Aziz asked them how the commission would be shared and told them that he had to pay a percentage of the premium to the Labour Attaché in the Embassy for every successful PB signed up with AIG. James informed that he would get 25% of the premium. All of them understood that they had to pay the Attaché because he had the authority to recommend AIG. They agreed to split the commission to certain fixed percentages. They were also willing to give a higher percentage to the Labour Attaché because he had the power to recommend AIG for the PB programme. Aziz subsequently informed Agus that James was willing to give a commission for every successful PB signed up.

> (c)     In February 2018, AIG was the first insurance company to get accredited. In the same month, James informed that he negotiated for a higher commission of 35%, and the commission sharing was finalised as follows – James and Aziz (6% each), Samad and Benjamin (1.5% each) and Agus (20%). After Liberty was accredited in March, James told them they would receive the same percentage of the share of commission.

> (d)     Every month, James would inform Aziz how many PBs were signed. Sometime in March 2018, James passed an amount of about $7,700 to Aziz, containing the shares of Agus, Samad and Aziz. Aziz passed Agus his first share of the commission (about $5,600) and told him “thank you” as a gesture for bringing the deal to him.

> (e)     Subsequently, Aziz received the commission pay outs from James for himself, Agus and Samad for both AIG and Liberty. He would always pass Agus his share of the commission. Occasionally, Aziz would also ask James for an advance, and these would be later deducted from the commission pay outs.

> (f)     Aziz and James had asked Agus for an official proposal to justify the commission, but Agus failed to give them anything.

74     In his third statement dated 3 July 2018 at about 12.50 p.m.[^76], Aziz stated the following:

> (a)     Aziz and James had broached the topic of paying bribes to Agus to Benjamin and Samad because they were close friends. James and Aziz also knew that Agus wanted the money for himself. It was very clear to Aziz because “_Agus told_ \[him\] _that this was how things worked in Indonesia_”.[^77] Aziz maintained that he was not willing to help Agus in this, and he really wanted to help the Indonesian FDWs.

> (b)     James was always the one doing the calculations for the commissions. Aziz was not the one who calculated and did not know the exact quantum of PBs sold each month.

> (c)     Aziz knew that the reason James agreed to give him 6% of the commission was because Aziz told James that he was affiliated to Agus and he could recommend James to Agus to accredit AIG to sell PB.

> (d)     Sometime in February 2018, Aziz met up with representatives from Tokio Marine and AVA (PW9 David, Michael and PW10 Choo Boon Siong) to discuss the PB programme. Agus had told Aziz that AIG and Liberty were not on good terms with AVA and that Aziz should get a “_high commission_” from AVA so that they would withdraw.[^78] Aziz knew that Agus was referring to money akin to the amounts he was receiving from James.

> (e)     Aziz later told PW9 David and Michael that AIG was giving Agus and the Embassy a cut of 40% from the premium. They were shocked and understood the 40% as a form of bribe to be accredited. They did not give an answer and informed that they needed to consult their management. Subsequently, Aziz asked them for an update and they informed that the quantum demanded was too high. The discussion was not continued thereafter.

75     In his fourth statement dated 19 July 2018 at about 11.10 a.m.[^79], Aziz stated the following:

> (a)     Aziz reiterated that all the calculations for the commission payments were done by James and he would be given a breakdown of the money to be given to Agus, Samad and Benjamin. Aziz was only aware of the amount of PB sold each month based on updates from James and Agus, and he would then estimate the amount of commission due to him.

> (b)     Aziz confirmed that all the money meant for Agus was given to Agus and he did not keep any part of it.

> (c)     Aziz explained certain messages found in his handphone and confirmed that before he even met James, he had told Benjamin that the insurance agent had to pay money to the Embassy or they would not be able to sell the PB. Benjamin later confirmed that James was agreeable to give commission to the Embassy.

> (d)     Agus would frequently ask Aziz to “chase” James for payment, and had also threatened to “switch off the system” if James refused or delayed the payment. Aziz had told James about this as well.

76     In his fifth statement dated 24 July 2018 at about 2.40 p.m.[^80], Aziz confirmed the various places which he had received and passed money relating to the PB.

### Evidence from the Prosecution witnesses

#### CPIB officers

77     PW3 Chris, PW4 Johnston, PW5 Mak and PW6 Lam all gave evidence in the main trial as well.

78     PW3 Chris gave evidence that CPIB had requested for Agus’ diplomatic immunity to be waived but this request was not acceded to. As such, CPIB never got to interview Agus about these allegations, and PW3 Chris agreed in cross examination that they could not confirm that Agus had corruptly pocketed the money which was paid to him. PW3 Chris also agreed that they did not know whether Agus had accounted to the Embassy for the monies taken.

79     PW4 Johnston recorded two of Aziz’s statements, and gave evidence that Aziz was not evasive during his questioning, and whatever PW4 Johnston asked, Aziz just told him accordingly. In cross examination, PW4 Johnston was asked about certain discrepancies within Aziz’s statements, and maintained that whatever Aziz said, he just recorded without always checking the calculations.

80     PW5 Mak recorded three of James’ statements, and gave evidence that there was very little discussion about the CSR between him and James, as James did not bring it up. PW5 Mak explained that when recording James’ statement, he would not have just blindly type in whatever James wanted to say. He would have only put in things which were credible and made sense, even if these were things which did not support the CPIB’s initial case hypothesis. He maintained that as a recorder, he was there to gather the facts of the case, and not to prove a case hypothesis. PW5 Mak also confirmed that James did not try to explain to him that 20% of the premium was supposed to go towards welfare programmes for the Indonesian FDWs i.e. CSR.

81     PW6 Lam recorded three of James’ statements, and gave evidence that James had tried to explain to him that 20% of the commission was meant for CSR, but upon further questioning by PW6 Lam, James ultimately agreed that the commission was not meant for CSR, and that CSR was actually very preliminary at that stage. PW6 Lam confirmed that he had asked James to give him some examples of the CSR events which were organised but James could not do so at that point.

#### PW7 Manik Bucha

82     PW7 Manik was the head of personal insurance for AIG in Singapore. He gave evidence that James was the one who brought the proposition for the Indonesian PB to them. PW7 Manik engaged in several conversations with him and Aziz about this product. Aziz was introduced to him by James as a translator and someone who knew the Indonesian officials at the Embassy.

83     James also arranged for PW7 Manik to meet up with Agus and a Ms Marlisa from the Embassy, sometime in November 2017. During this meeting with the Embassy representatives, Agus and Ms Marlisa broached the topic of CSR and how they wanted to run welfare programmes for the FDWs in Singapore. They asked if AIG was keen to sponsor some of these events. PW7 Manik’s response was that he could not commit to anything and this would have to be brought up to and approved by the internal team at AIG. He confirmed that AIG did not make any commitment during that meeting and that in fact AIG did not go on to contribute to any CSR events. PW7 Manik also confirmed that for such corporate sponsorship, the money would be paid by bank transfer or cheque, and never by cash. According to him, AIG never committed to $1 per transaction for CSR.

84     AIG was accredited by the Embassy on 5 January 2018, and after negotiations, AIG agreed to pay James 45% commission for this product. The initial offer was 35% but after taking into account the fact that James was required by the Embassy to have a physical presence at the Embassy to explain about the product to FDWs who came by to renew their passports, AIG agreed to a 45% commission. According to PW7 Manik, this was similar to the commission given to agents for the Philippines embassy bond as well.[^81] PW7 Manik was not aware that James had shared his commission with anyone else and denied knowing specifically that James was contributing 20% of his commission for the purposes of CSR. PW7 Manik’s evidence was that the CSR was not something they would price into the commission. PW7 Manik also maintained that contribution to the CSR was not a precondition for getting accredited. He agreed in cross examination that what James chose to do with his commission was something for him to decide himself, but if agents decided to use a portion of their commission towards CSR, then he would have expected them to declare this to AIG.’

85     According to PW7 Manik, AIG agents were not allowed to share their commission with anyone. He referred to the AIG Agent’s Code of Conduct[^82] at Clause 8, which stated that:

>     Rebating and/or inducement are strictly prohibited. Agents must not offer any incentives (monetary or non-monetary) to induce any prospect/client to purchase a policy.

>     Agents must also not offer to rebate to any prospect/client part or all of the commissions they would earn in the sale of any policy to induce that prospect/client to purchase that policy.

PW7 Manik explained that Clause 8 was with respect to an agent using his or her commission to influence a party to buy the insurance product. With regard to this particular case, PW7 Manik would place the Embassy as a “prospect”, as the product was built for the Embassy.[^83]

#### PW8 Low Hwee Huan Derek

86     PW8 Derek was the Executive Vice President (non-Motor) of Liberty at the material time, and was approached by James regarding the PB proposition. PW8 Derek confirmed that based on the Philippine embassy bond, which was the most similar product on the market to the Indonesian PB, the commission payable to an agent was about 40 – 45% of the premium.[^84]

87     After James first broached the idea to him, PW8 Derek and his team came up with some ideas as to how to structure the product, and did up a set of presentation slides as exhibited at Tab 2 of James’ Case for the Defence[^85]. However, PW8 Derek maintained that these were ideas at a preliminary stage, which had not been cleared with compliance. After this set of slides were sent to James in November 2017, he did not respond and the next time PW8 Derek heard back from James substantively was when James was already working with AIG on the PB, with a commission payable as 45%. Liberty then went back to do their calculations and since the sums still made commercial sense, they agreed to come onboard on similar terms. The presentation slides and ideas were never further discussed or developed.

88     On 9 February 2018, PW8 Derek attended an interview at the Embassy with Ms Marlisa, who broached the topic of CSR for the first time. She told them that if they got accredited, they would be approached to sponsor CSR activities, although she emphasized that this was purely voluntary. This was the first time PW8 Derek came across the term CSR in the PB context. PW8 Derek responded that they needed to seek clearance internally, and requested for a list of the planned CSR activities in 2018. However, that list never came. Liberty was approached on four occasions to contribute to CSR activities, and they made a contribution of $2,000 on one occasion. This was paid by cheque and made out to the Embassy. PW8 Derek also gave evidence that after some internal discussions, he had told James that they could only afford to contribute $1 for each bond sold. PW8 Derek denied knowing that James contributed 20% of his commission towards CSR.

#### PW9 Loh Yeow Kwong David

89     PW9 David was a business development manager of Tokio Marine Insurance Singapore Ltd at the material time. He gave evidence that he first learnt about the Indonesian Embassy PB from Michael and PW10 Choo Boon Siong (“PW10 Choo”), who were representatives from AVA Insurance. AVA Insurance was Tokio Marine’s marketing partners with regard to FDW insurance. Following this, PW9 David then contacted the Embassy to find out who was in charge of this PB programme, as Tokio Marine was interested to be accredited to sell the PB as well. He managed to speak to Agus, and was told that Agus would consider it. Some time later, a “Mr Aslam’ (whom PW9 David confirmed in court was Aziz) contacted him to discuss the PB programme. Several conversations took place with Aziz.

90     On 2 March 2018, during a conversation at Bedok Food Centre, Aziz requested for commission at 40% of the premium for himself and Agus, as a reward for his efforts to recommend them for accreditation. PW9 David understood this to mean that Aziz was requesting for a bribe for him to put in a good word for them for the accreditation. PW9 David’s reply was that he had to take this up to his management. On 5 March 2020, there was an internal discussion at Tokio Marine involving the Chief Executive, Mr Cher Ah Kow. Michael and PW10 Choo were also present. At the meeting, it was decided that they would not make any form of payment unless it was for official CSR purpose. Thereafter, PW9 David still had contact with Aziz, but only to stall for time as Tokio Marine was wary of offending the Embassy. When asked for an update by Aziz, PW9 David responded that he had to seek clearance from their head office. At one point when PW9 David went to Vietnam on holiday, he also received several text messages from Aziz to check on whether he had managed to write to their head office.

91     Sometime in September 2018, PW9 David called the Embassy to find out the outcome of their application, in order to seek a closure on this issue. He was later sent an email to put in certain supporting documents, and proceeded to do so. However, before the application could proceed further, Agus was recalled back to Indonesia and the PB programme was subsequently terminated.

#### PW10 Choo Boon Siong

92     PW10 Choo was a director at AVA Insurance Agency Pte Ltd (“AVA”) at the material time. AVA worked with some principals, including Tokio Marine and Allied World, as an insurance agent. He gave evidence that sometime in late January or early February 2018, he first learnt about the Indonesian Embassy PB from the employment agencies. As 95% of the business of AVA Insurance dealt with FDW insurance, he hoped that their principals could get the accreditation to sell the bonds so that AVA could sell them too.

93     PW10 Choo first met Aziz (known to him then as “Mr Aslam”) on 1 March 2020 but he subsequently flew to Sarawak and was not further involved in the conversations until 5 March, at the internal discussion at Tokio Marine. His evidence was that at that point, they knew that Aziz was asking for a 40% commission on top of CSR, and they knew this was a form of bribery. The decision was taken not to accede to the request.

94     On 6 March 2020, he went to the airport with Michael and PW9 David to meet Aziz. During a conversation at MacDonald’s, Aziz asked for an update and PW10 Choo told him that the requested amount was too high. Aziz asked him why it could not be given since AIG and Liberty were giving it. Ultimately, PW9 Choo told Aziz that they needed to seek clearance from the head office. PW10 Choo explained in court that they were trying to be diplomatic as the nature of their business involved dealings with embassies, and they did not want to offend Aziz.

95     PW10 Choo also recalled another meeting with Agus in May 2018, where he and Michael were present. At this meeting, Agus was very specific in what he wanted, and how the payment should be made. Agus specifically asked for cash so that there would be no paper trail. They told him that they could not do it as there were audit processes. If it was for CSR, then it must be official and a receipt had to be given. Agus insisted on it being cash, and asked why they could not do it if other insurance companies could. The meeting did not end happily, and PW10 Choo did not recall any more communications thereafter.

### Forensic evidence

96     The handphones belonging to James and Aziz were seized and forensic evidence was tendered relating to extractions done on these phones. In particular, there were messages sent by James to Aziz which appeared to pertain to calculations of the number of PBs sold by AIG and Liberty[^86], as well as messages from Benjamin to James on 23 October 2017 asking him if he was interested to look at “_volume insurance for Indonesian maids_”[^87] and later on 24 October 2017 at 11.56 a.m. telling James that “_For this deal..we are working at embassy level and party commission will need to be covered from insurer side_..”[^88]

97     On 24 October 2017 at 12.59 p.m., Benjamin sent a message to Aziz telling him, amongst other things, that “_Re commission will be covered._”[^89]

## Amendment of charges and submissions at the close of the Prosecution’s Case

### Minor amendment of charges against James and Aziz

98     At the close of its case, the Prosecution confirmed that it was offering Samad and Michael to the Defence as witnesses. The Prosecution also applied to make some typograpical amendments to the 12th, 15th and 18th charges relating to James (DAC 938409-2018, DAC 938412-2018 and DAC 938415-2018), as well as to amend the 19th charge relating to Aziz (DAC 938438-2018) by removing the reference to "Michael Chew”.

99     The amended charges were read to both accused persons, who confirmed they were still claiming trial to the charges. Counsel for both accused persons also confirmed that they were not applying to recall any of the witnesses in relation to the amended charges.

### Submissions by Aziz at the close of the Prosecution’s case

100    At the close of the Prosecution’s case, counsel for Aziz made a submission of no case in relation to the charges involving payments from Liberty, as well as the 19th charge for soliciting a bribe from Tokio Marine.

101    In essence, the objection taken to the Liberty charges was that there was no credible evidence that Aziz was aware of what the sharing percentages were like, and no evidence that Aziz was in fact aware of the exact amounts which were given to him on each occasion. Counsel also pointed out that there were discrepancies within Aziz’s statements with regard to the commission arrangements for the Liberty payments. In particular, in exhibit P20 at \[22\], Aziz referred to the commission due to him as 9%, and in exhibit P21 at \[43\], the percentage due to him was 6% instead.

102    The objection taken to the 19th charge was that there was no evidence that this request was objectively corrupt, in that all Aziz had asked for was a commission which was not necessarily by itself corrupt, and more importantly that there was no evidence of Aziz’s corrupt intent, given that he had said in his statements that his objective was to put Tokio Marine off, and not to obtain a bribe.

103    The Prosecution’s response in relation to the Liberty charges was that the evidence that Aziz knew of the sharing arrangement for the payments from Liberty could be found in his statements, and that minor discrepancies in his statements could be resolved at the end of the trial. Ultimately, the Prosecution’s point was that the evidence all pointed to the fact that the arrangement with Liberty was similar to the arrangement with AIG. The fact that Aziz may not have known the exact amounts which were given to him on each occasion was inherent in the very corrupt nature of the transactions he agreed to take part in. Aziz had agreed to let James compute the amounts and he never asked for a record of it, or to count the money when it was given to him. Ultimately, Aziz did agree to the sharing arrangement and the percentages and it did not lie in his mouth now to say that he was not guilty because he did not know the exact amounts on each occasion.

104    With regard to the 19th charge against Aziz, the Prosecution relied on Aziz’s statement[^90] as evidence that he knew what he was asking for was in the same nature as what they had been getting from AIG and Liberty, and his purported intention to put Tokio Marine off was contradicted by the evidence from PW9 David and PW10 Choo, which showed that he still followed up with them regarding the commission payment, even after the first time he broached the topic.

#### Court’s decision in relation to the submission of no case

105    Having considered the evidence tendered by the Prosecution as well as the submissions made, I was of the view that a _prima facie_ case had been made against all three accused persons on all the charges they were faced with.

106    With regard to the 18 mirror charges faced by James and Aziz for giving and receiving gratification, the evidence of the payments themselves, the nature of the payments and the intention of the parties in giving and receiving these payments could be found in the accused persons’ own statements. In particular, the amounts calculated in each charge was based on James’ calculations, which he confirmed in court to be accurate[^91]. It was also clear from Aziz’s statements that James was in charge of computing the calculations.

107    In relation to the point on Aziz’s lack of knowledge of the sharing arrangement for the Liberty commissions, I noted that, as pointed out by his counsel, there appeared to be a discrepancy on the face of Aziz’s statements. However, having considered the statements as a whole, it was clear that there appeared to be no difference in the way the parties treated the commissions from AIG and Liberty. Aziz had also clarified the 6% and 9% discrepancies in his statement when he explained (in exhibit P22 at \[56\]) that when he referred to 9%, it was because he had factored in Samad and Benjamin’s shares of 1.5% and 1.5%. While this clarification appeared to specifically relate to the commission sharing for PBs sold by AIG, I found it too artificial to draw a clear distinction between the PBs sold by AIG and those sold by Liberty. The statements made it clear that the involved parties made no such distinction.

108    I was therefore prepared to accept, at the close of the Prosecution’s case, that a _prima facie_ case had been established on these charges against Aziz involving the payments from Liberty.

109    With regard to the 19th charge faced by Aziz, the nature of the payment he was soliciting was stated in his statement at exhibit P22. As for his intention, the evidence suggested that he had asked for this commission, and followed up with this request by checking in for updates and even calling PW9 David when he was away on holiday. Again, I accepted that there was a _prima facie_ case for Aziz to answer to.

110    I also found, on the basis of the statements tendered, that there was a prima facie case against Benjamin on the single charge of abetting to corruptly solicit gratification.

111    I therefore called on all three accused persons to enter their defence.

## Defence Case

112    All three accused persons elected to remain silent, and no further witnesses were called or evidence tendered in support of their defence.

## Court’s Decision on Conviction

### Elements of the offences

113    There was no dispute over the elements of an offence under s 5(_a_) and 5(_b_) of the PCA[^92], as summarised below:

> (a)     The giving or receipt of gratification;

> (b)     As an inducement or reward for doing (or forbearing to do) anything in respect of any matter;

> (c)     There was an objectively corrupt element in the transaction; and

> (d)     The gratification was given or received with guilty knowledge.

114    For Benjamin, there was also the added element of abetment by intentionally aiding.

### Statements by accused persons given full weight

115    Having been satisfied that the statements had been voluntarily made by all three accused persons, I saw little reason why full weight should not be ascribed to them. They were generally consistent and coherent, and were also corroborated partly by some of the phone messages. For example, the explanations given by the accused persons on the messages referring to commission and how “_commission will need to be covered_”[^93] were rational and made sense in the context of the messages. They were also consistent with one another. In contrast, James’ attempt on the stand to explain this away by saying that the chronology of events was mixed up by the recorder, was difficult to follow.[^94]

116    Benjamin did not challenge the admissibility of any of his statements, and gave no evidence to explain any of them. Any explanations he attempted to give in his submissions could not be accepted as they did not constitute evidence. There was no reason for me not to place full weight on his statements.

117    I was also satisfied that the accused persons had been given the opportunity to make any amendments to the statements that they wish. In particular, there were handwritten amendments made to the statements by James and Aziz. There was therefore no reason to doubt that these statements as amended by the accused persons, accurately reflected what they had told the CPIB.

118    Counsel for Aziz argued that there were portions of the statements from James and Aziz which appeared to have been plagiarised from each other, thus leading to a suspicion that the recorders had simply copied and pasted from the various statements and pieced together something which was not the accused persons’ statements. In particular, counsel referred to paragraphs 31 – 33 in exhibit P21 and paragraphs 32 to 33 in exhibit P28. I have examined these statements and the paragraphs, but I was unable to see the striking similarity referred to, apart from the fact that they appear to be referring to the same meeting between the accused persons and Samad. On the face of the statements and these paragraphs, there was no basis to find that there may have been any copying or plagiarism involved.

119    Counsel for Aziz also highlighted that the references to “_this is how things are done in Indonesia_” appeared to be inconsistent in that it first appeared in Aziz’s statement only after James admitted in his statement that this is what he had heard from Aziz. However, in a later statement James clarified that he had actually heard it from Benjamin or Samad, not Aziz. I did not find this particularly troubling. It was likely that this phrase might have been used by more than one person during the material time, or that the accused persons did not remember correctly who had said it at which time. This was perfectly reasonable. If the recorders were going to copy and paste portions of the statements, it did not make sense for them to copy and paste this, and not do the same for the other more pertinent portions relating to the commission sharing arrangements.

120    In all, I was satisfied that the contents generally came from the accused persons themselves, subject to some summary and rephrasing by the recorders. I did not think this was a problem in itself. Ultimately the accused persons had a chance to read through their statements and make any amendments before appending their signatures.

121    I noted that there were some discrepancies which appeared in Aziz’s statements. One example pointed out by counsel was the issue of when exactly Aziz came to know of the final percentage distribution for the commission. In exhibit P20 at \[22\], Aziz appeared to say this was in April 2018, but in a later statement (exhibit P21 at \[43\]), this was in March 2018 instead. However, I was of the view that these discrepancies did not detract from the credibility of the statements as a whole. I accepted the reality that statements from the accused persons are put together by the recorders in the course of the interviews, trying to reflect what the interviewee had ultimately agreed is the correct version. I was under no illusion that an accused person could sit down and recite out the relevant details in a coherent fashion and straight into a statement. The point is that however the information got into the statements, Aziz accepted it as true. He had a chance to read the statements and amend them. He made substantial amendments to portions of the statements. What is left, and what he ultimately signed off on, must therefore be what he accepted as his statement. As set out at \[61\] to \[70\] above, I did not find that his will had been sapped to the point that he would sign off on something which was completely untrue.

122    Discrepancies aside, the tenor of all the statements was the same – the three accused persons had taken part in an arrangement to share the James’ commission from the sale of PBs. This arrangement included a portion of the commission to be paid to Agus, for the purpose of getting AIG and Liberty accredited. A portion had been paid to Aziz, as an inducement and reward in him recommending AIG and Liberty to Agus for accreditation. Benjamin had introduced Aziz to James, knowing full well that this was the sort of arrangement Aziz was looking for. The tenor of the statements did not change, even in the subsequent statements when both James and Aziz were out on bail.

123    As pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused persons did not go on to give evidence in their own defence, and nothing new was raised since the ancillary hearings, to cause me to doubt the voluntariness and accuracy of these statements.

#### Statements to be used against each other

124    The Prosecution initially argued that the statements for each accused person should also be used against each other, but later conceded that this could not be done as s 258(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (“CPC”) in its present iteration did not apply to the present case.

125    Instead, the applicable version (as of 29 June 2018) is set out below:

![]([2021] SGDC 0232_Image/[2021] SGDC 0232_image2.png)

126    As pointed out by counsel for James, there is case authority for the proposition that a confession from a co-accused _cannot_ be used against an accused unless they have been charged for the same crimes. In other words, s 258(5) of the CPC (as of 29 June 2018) would only apply if: (a) the co-accused persons faced the exact same charges for identical crimes; or (b) one of the co-accused person was charged with either abetting the other in the commission of the offence with which the other was charged, or attempting to commit the exact same offence as the other. (See _PP v Ramesh a/l Perumal and another_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 290</span> (“_Ramesh_”) at \[47\]).

127    However on this issue, I was not entirely convinced that I was strictly prohibited by law to use the statements of the accused persons against one another in the present case. In my view, giving and receiving a bribe must practically fall within the definition of a “same offence”. Notably, the Explanation to this provision states that “offence” here would include the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.

128    The mirror charges faced by the James and Aziz relate to the exact same payment transaction, the only difference being that one was a giver and the other a receiver, and their charges were therefore given a different subsection in the legislative provision. In some respects, giving a bribe can be said to be abetting the receiving of the bribe. There is no difference. If I accept that, by virtue of his statement, James had indeed given a bribe of a certain amount to Aziz, it defeats logic for me to then find that there is insufficient evidence against Aziz because he had not mentioned the amount in his statement. The court must be able to refer to the statement by James for the purpose of finding that just as James had given, Aziz had received.

129    In the case of _Ramesh_, the charges faced by the offenders were clearly different although it involved the same bundle of drugs. One was charged with delivering the drugs to the other, and the second was charged with being in possession of the said drugs for the purposes of trafficking (after it had been delivered to him). To that extent, the case can be distinguished from the mirror charges faced by James and Aziz in the present case.

130    It is more arguable whether Benjamin’s charge can be categorised as a “same offence” together with these mirror charges, and out of prudence, I would choose not to take his statements into account in relation to the other accused persons, and vice versa. Similarly, Aziz’s charge for soliciting gratification from Tokio Marine had nothing to do with Benjamin or James, and his statements in that regard were relevant only to himself.

131    In any case, even if I am wrong on this point, each accused person’s statement was enough evidence against him. I also note that James confirmed on the stand that the calculations in his statement with regard to the amount of monies transacted for each occasion, was correct[^95]. In so far as the amounts in each transaction are concerned, this was therefore no longer simply evidence from the statements, but from the stand, and could clearly be taken into account against each of the accused person.

132    For completeness, I note that it is trite law that an accomplice’s evidence can be taken into account against an offender. _In Chua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 342</span> (“_Chua Poh Kiat Anthony_”), the High Court confirmed that a court could convict an offender based on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, but should treat such evidence with caution as the accomplice might be presumed unworthy of credit. However, an accomplice’s evidence should be given the same weight as any other evidence so long as it was shown that the evidence was reliable from all the circumstances of the case. [^96]

133    As set out above, I was satisfied that the statements from the accused persons were voluntarily given and a reliable source of evidence. There was no indication that the accused persons were falsely implicating each other in order to lessen their culpability. In fact, the statements were self-incriminating as well, and there appeared to be no reason for them to have taken that extra step to implicate each other, if it were not the truth. I also noted that at trial, the accused persons appeared to take a common stance in their defence, and I did not find that in giving evidence at their respective ancillary hearings, James or Aziz’s evidence should be treated with any caution as against each other.

134    I therefore placed full weight on the statements (and evidence) given by the accused persons. For the mirror charges faced by James and Aziz, I took both of their statements into account as against themselves as well as each other. I would reiterate that even if I am wrong on the point regarding the use of a confession against a co-accused, my analysis would not change, as the statements of each accused person were in fact sufficient to establish the necessary elements against them.

### Inferences drawn against accused persons from their silence

135    It was clear to me from the statements alone that there was some explaining which each of the accused persons needed to do. This was especially so if their position was that the payments made were for another more innocuous purpose, quite apart from whatever was stated in the statements. However, they chose not to give evidence in their own defence, and in the circumstances, I drew the necessary inferences against them.

136    Benjamin did not object for his statements to be admitted, even when he was represented. In his statements, there were clear admissions that he knew Aziz was expecting to get commissions from the PB deal, even before he contacted James to ask if he was interested. Both he and James knew that if no commissions were given, the PB deal would be off.[^97] Although Benjamin tried to give some explanations for these statements in his closing submissions, these do not constitute evidence as this was not evidence given from the stand and therefore not tested. I was unable to take them into account. His statements stood unexplained, and the only inference left for me to draw was that there was no other explanation to the contents as set out in his statements, and the truth was as stated in them.

137    In his evidence given at his ancillary hearing, Aziz kept saying that he tried to say what was accurate but this was rejected by the recorders.[^98] However, Aziz never went on to explain what was the account that he tried to give to CPIB. The obvious question that arose was what _did_ happen according to Aziz and what did he tell PW3 Chris? Why could he not have taken the stand to explain this? Faced with his silence when defence was called, I was left to infer that there was no other more innocuous explanation he could provide for the events that unfolded, and reaffirmed my view that the contents in his statements were in fact accurate.

138    James, in contrast to the other two accused persons, did put up a defence during his ancillary hearing. He gave evidence that the 20% payments he made to Agus were in fact payments towards CSR, and not for the purpose of bribing Agus. It was of course, not ideal that this evidence was given during the ancillary hearing and not during the main trial, as the relevant issue at the ancillary hearing was a much more narrow one, involving only the admissibility of the statements. I would have expected more to be said about the CSR defence during the main trial, and I would also assume that the Prosecution would be more ready to rigorously cross examine him on this CSR point at the main trial. Nevertheless, I accepted that James did give some evidence on this point, which I could take into account in the main trial.[^99] Therefore, the only inference I drew was that there was no further evidence or explanation he could give for this defence, beyond what he had already said during his ancillary hearing.

### First element: No dispute that monies were paid

139    There did not appear to be a dispute that monies were transacted between the parties. James acknowledged this on the stand and also confirmed his calculations in his statements, which amounts were reflected in the charges. The statements from Benjamin and Aziz also showed that the monies had been paid, and no evidence was given by either of them that this did not take place.

140    I accepted that these amounts were the correct amounts, on the basis of the following:

> (a)     James confirmed these calculations in court, and this evidence was not disputed by either Benjamin or Aziz;

> (b)     These calculations were based on objective records in the form of Statement of Accounts from AIG and Liberty;

> (c)     From the accused persons’ statements, it was clear that James was the person in charge of calculating the commissions payable to each individual. This made sense, as he was the insurance agent through whom the commission payments came; and

> (d)     The statements from Aziz also made clear that whatever monies James gave to him for Agus, was given by him to Agus without fail.

141    Counsel for Aziz raised the issue that Aziz did not in fact know how much was given to him and Agus at any one point in time. I did not think that this was relevant. I accepted that there was an agreement with regard to the percentages of the commission which would be shared among the parties. Aziz knew that he would be getting 6% of the commission, and Agus 20%. There was also evidence from the phone messages that he was updated by James on the number of PBs sold. Aziz therefore would have been able to know, and probably did know, whether James had given him the correct amount of money. According to his statements, he had also helped to distribute the different amounts to Samad and Agus. I did not think it mattered even if he only counted the money afterwards to see if it was the correct amount. The point is that he had received this amount of money on the basis of the percentage sharing agreement which they had.

142    The next question was the purpose for which these monies were paid.

### Second element: The monies were paid as a reward/inducement for showing favour in accreditation

143    The evidence for this could be found in the statements from all three accused persons. Some examples are listed below.

> (a)     In exhibit P4 at \[36\], Benjamin stated, “_I also told James something to the effect that if no commission is given to Aziz, the deal would be off since Aziz stated that he wanted to receive commissions and needed to pay someone from the Embassy_.”

> (b)     In exhibit P4 at \[38\], Benjamin stated, “_I wish to state that yes, Aziz did tell me that someone from the embassy needed to be paid and I relayed the message to James. I recall telling James that it is common for people to cover each other in Indonesia. By covering each other, I meant giving money to do business in Indonesia. In this instance, it was giving money to someone from the Embassy to do business with the Embassy._”

> (c)     In exhibit P28 at \[33\], James stated, “_Although I did not want to care too much as to why we have to split a portion to Agus, I know in my heart that it was given to him so that AIG can have a higher chance to be the appointed insurer for the performance bond_.”

> (d)     In exhibit P28 at \[50\], James was asked why it was agreed that 20% of the commission would be given to Agus and he stated, “_So that AIG can have a higher chance of being accredited as the insurance company to issue the letter of Guarantee_.” When asked how Agus could help in the accreditation, James stated, “_I am not sure but since he is the Labour Attaché, I thought that he could make certain decisions_.” When asked why he gave the money to Aziz for him to pass to Agus, James stated, “_It was given to Agus as per agreement and also as a thank you gift and token of appreciation because AIG and Liberty were the accredited companies issuing the Letter of Guarantee_." James also confirmed in the same statement that there was no other purpose to giving Agus the money.

> (e)     In exhibit P20 at \[15\], Aziz was asked why James would want to give part of his commission to Agus, and he stated, “_James told me a covered up story that he wanted to contribute it to Agus for CSR (coporate social responsibility). But it could not be true as the CSR being discussed during the meetings with Indonesia would be paid in lump sum to Indonesia Embassy directly by AIG. Therefore, James must have given the 14% to 15% commission to Agus as Agus had helped AIG to be accredited in Indonesia Embassy to sell the performance bond_.”

> (f)     In exhibit P21 at \[33\] and \[34\], Aziz stated, “_I told them that I had to pay a percentage for every successful PB that signed up with AIG. At that time, I did not inform them the labour attache was Agus but I was referring to him. During the discussion, all of them understand that we had to pay the labour attache of the Indonesian Embassy as he has the authority to recommend AIG_…”

144    There was no dispute that Agus was the Labour Attaché of the Embassy at the relevant time. The statements clearly showed that the accused persons agreed to pay Agus a portion of the commission so that he would show favour in the accreditation of AIG and Liberty to sell the PBs. The payments made out to Agus thereafter, were based on this agreement, and were a form of reward for showing such favour.

145    As for the payments made out to Aziz, the statements also indicated that James had agreed to pay him because he felt that Aziz would be able to help him “_influence the officials at the Embassy to use AIG, or accredit AIG as the insurance company_”[^100] for the PB. According to James, Aziz had told him that he was in a position to influence Agus, and James believed him because Aziz was very close to Agus and he felt that Agus relied on Aziz’s opinions and comments. Therefore, James felt that he needed to pay Aziz so that he can help “_convince Agus to accredit AIG and Liberty_”.[^101] Aziz also confirmed in his statement his understanding that James had agreed to pay him a portion of the commission because he had told James that he was “_affiliated to Agus and_ \[he\] _could recommend him to Agus to accredit AIG to sell the PB_”.[^102] The payments to Aziz thereafter was also based on this agreement, and was a form of reward to him for helping to get these two companies accredited. Neither James nor Aziz took the stand to explain that there was any other motive involved. I therefore accepted the account as given in the statements.

146    This was also supported in part by the evidence from PW9 David and PW10 Choo, who confirmed that Aziz had tried to solicit from them a portion of the payable commission, by way of a bribe for accreditation. Aziz had referred to the arrangements with AIG, and when Tokio Marine expressed hesitation, asked why they couldn’t give the commission if AIG could give it.”[^103] This also indirectly revealed the nature of the payments which were being made by James, who was representing AIG and Liberty.

#### I rejected the possibility that the monies paid to Agus were for the purpose of CSR

147    This appeared to be the defence run by James, based on his evidence during the ancillary hearing, although no formal evidence of this was given in the course of the main trial. No evidence of this was given at all by either Benjamin or Aziz.

148    The defence appeared to be that the monies were paid to Agus for the purpose of contributing towards CSR for the FDWs, in the organising of events for their welfare. The money came from a portion of James’ commission because there was no time to go through the formal processes for approval of CSR payments in AIG and Liberty.

149    Given that James had given some evidence on this in his ancillary hearing, I was prepared to consider the evidence on this point. However, I did not find this CSR possibility to be plausible at all, for the reasons set out below:

> (a)     There was no documentation whatsoever that could support the position that the payments to Agus were for the purpose of CSR. Given that CSR was a formal request for contribution by the Embassy, I found it difficult to believe that either the Embassy, or AIG and Liberty would deal with it via cash and with completely no paperwork or trail. The letters from the Embassy attached as Tab 4 to James’ Case for the Defence (exhibit B2-D1) did not assist the defence, and in fact supported the proposition that CSR payments would be formally requested for by the Embassy, pertaining to specific events. There were also emails sent by James to PW7 Manik and PW8 Derek in June and July 2018, forwarding requests for sponsorship of certain events[^104] PW8 Derek also gave evidence that eventually Liberty did make a lump sum payment of $2,000 for one such event. This clearly showed the way CSR requests and payments were dealt with, with proper documentary trail and compliance processes, and in a lump sum. Pertinently, in none of these letters or emails was there any mention that CSR contributions had _already_ been made by AIG or Liberty, although this would have been a few months after the first pay outs to Agus (in March 2018). This was true even for the emails from James himself.

> (b)     PW7 Manik and PW8 Derek both denied that they knew a part of the commission was meant for CSR, and confirmed that contributions to CSR would be done in a lump sum, and not by way of cash. In fact, in James’ first statement to the CPIB, which he did not challenge the admissibility of, he also confirmed that he did not tell PW7 Manik, PW8 Derek, or anyone at AIG and Liberty that he was giving a portion of his commission to Aziz.[^105]

> (c)     James relied on a powerpoint slide attached to his Case for the Defence (exhibit B2D1), where it was stated that “_A certain portion of the bond premium is to be allocated to a welfare fund to be administered by the Indonesian Embassy. The fund proceeds will be used to further promote the welfare of the Indonesian domestic helpers in Singapore_.” However, this powerpoint presentation was explained by PW8 Derek to have been preliminary ideas which were not yet cleared with management. Although these slides were sent to James, he never got back on them and the eventual arrangement looked nothing like what had been proposed in the slides.

> (d)     This CSR defence did not appear in any of the accused persons’ multiple statements. I should reiterate that I found that all the statements had been voluntarily given by the accused persons.

> (e)     There was also no mention of the payments being made towards CSR in any of the messages found in the seized handphones. Of course, there were not many messages referring to the payments at all, and much less as bribes. I could understand why this would be so, given the illicit nature of such payments, but why not about CSR if they were genuinely legitimate payments? Pertinently, there were no messages from the accused persons to Agus trying to at least get some form of acknowledgment that the monies had been received for this purpose, even though James had stated that he did tell Aziz to get some “_black and white_” for “_audit purpose_”[^106]. This evidence was not supported by the phone messages.

150    A point was raised by counsel for James the CPIB did not properly investigate if the monies which James had given to Agus had indeed gone towards CSR i.e. did Agus account for the monies with the Embassy? However, in my view this was a red herring. Whether or not the money ultimately went towards CSR was not relevant. The point is that I did not believe that the accused persons had made this payment to Agus _intending_ for it to be a CSR contribution. Even if Agus had indeed taken the money given to him by James and gave it to the Embassy for CSR purposes, this did not change the nature of the payments when they were first given. The accused persons had given this money to Agus as a reward/inducement for the accreditation of AIG and Liberty to sell the PBs. What Agus then chose to do with the money was his business, and did not affect the culpability of the accused persons. A bribe is a bribe, even if the money eventually goes towards charitable causes.

#### The absence of Agus was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case

151    This case was unusual as the main receiver of the payments, Agus, was not called to the stand. In fact, he was not even called up for investigations, as he had diplomatic immunity. This was confirmed by PW3 Chris, whose evidence was that CPIB approached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to waive this immunity but was not successful. Eventually, as far as CPIB was aware, Agus was recalled back to Indonesia sometime in November 2018.[^107] Given the circumstances, I accepted the difficulty the Prosecution faced in producing him as a witness, and did not draw an adverse inference against the Prosecution for this.

152    Unfortunately, this also meant that there was a lack of evidence in so far as Agus’ side of the story was concerned. As highlighted by counsel for Aziz, there was no objective evidence that Agus could have influenced the accreditation process or that he actually did. Was it necessary to show this?

153    The case authorities on this specific point were not clear, but I took the view that it was not necessary for the Prosecution to prove either that Agus could have influenced the accreditation process, or that he actually did influence it. What was important was what the accused persons believed, and their motivations behind giving Agus the money.

154    The High Court in _Krishna Jayaram v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1989\] 3 MLJ 292</span> accepted that “one can be guilty of taking a bribe even if it is not proved that he has shown favour”, citing _R v Carr_ <span class="citation">\[1957\] 1 WLR 165</span> and s 9 of the PCA.

155    In the case of _Kannan s/o Kunjiraman & Anor v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 3 SLR(R) 294</span> (“_Kannan_”), one Rajendran had handed over a sum of $80,000 to the first appellant, for him to use in bribing one David Lee, a member of the national soccer team. Another sum of $5,000 was also handed over to the first appellant as a reward for his actions. However, the first appellant kept the money, and never communicated with David Lee at all. The High Court considered the culpability of the appellant as a receiver, and observed that the fact that the agreement was never carried into effect did not make a difference. At the time when the appellant received the monies, he knew what they were for and he still intended to receive it. He therefore received it with corrupt intent, even if he never intended to carry out the agreement to bribe David Lee. A similar reasoning was applied by the High Court in the case of _Tang Keng Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 104</span> at \[37\].

156    In the present case, Agus was the receiver. Going by the analysis in _Kannan_, even if he had received the payments, never intending to actually influence the accreditation, he would still be guilty of corruption if he knew that this was the purpose for which the payments were being given to him. Therefore, even if we accept that Agus did not in fact influence the accreditation, he would still be guilty of corruption if he knew the purpose which these payments were being made to him and he still accepted them. If so, then clearly the givers must be guilty as well.

157    To my mind, this must be the correct approach, and the one which accorded with common sense. The culpability of the accused persons should not be dependent on the intentions and actions of someone else. As long as there was evidence to show that the money had been given to Agus for the purpose of rewarding him for showing favour to AIG and Liberty, whether Agus himself intended to follow through with that agreement to show favour, or did in fact do so, did not impact on the accused persons’ culpability. I also noted that in the present case, there was reason for the accused persons to think that Agus had shown favour such as to warrant the reward being given. Not only was Agus the Labour Attaché of the Embassy, but AIG and Liberty were also duly accredited. As it turned out, they were the only ones ever accredited.

158    The Defence cited case authorities such as _PP v Har Su Meng_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 511</span>, _PP v Mohamed Abdul Gofar_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 23</span> and _PP v Low Tiong Choon_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 119</span> in support of the proposition that the Prosecution had to go on to prove that Agus did in fact show favour. In those cases, there were no admissions from the accused persons, and no other evidence to prove that the payments were corrupt in nature, and given with corrupt intent. In those circumstances, the ability to show that the agreed transaction or undue influence did take place would become relevant in order to establish the corrupt nature and intent of the payment in the first place. However, those cases did not establish the proposition that it was a separate element of the offence to show that the agreed transaction had in fact taken place. In the present case, there _was_ other evidence on the corrupt nature of the payments, such as the admissions from the accused persons. See \[143\] above.

159    Ultimately, I stood guided by the elements for a corruption offence as set out in _Leng Kah Poh_, which did not include a requirement for the corrupt transaction or agreement to have been carried out. The Court of Appeal also made it clear at \[20\] of the judgment that only the first element related to the _actus reus_ of the offence, while the remaining elements related to the _mens rea_. This further reaffirmed my view that in so far as proving the “corrupt” element in the transaction, it was the intentions and motivations of the accused persons that were critical.

160    Turning to the provisions themselves, there was nothing in the wording of s 5 PCA which required the purpose behind the corrupt payment to have been carried out. As pointed out by the Prosecution, the provision in fact includes actions which had only been “proposed” i.e. not actual or carried out. I accepted the point made by the Prosecution that if there was no requirement to prove that the proposed corrupt act was carried out in order to make out the charge under s 5 of the PCA, then it necessarily followed that whether or not the receiver actually had the power or authority to carry out the corrupt act was irrelevant.

161    Under s 9 of the PCA, an agent who corruptly receives any bribe shall be guilty even if he did not have the power, right or opportunity to show favour in relation to his principal’s affairs. There was no dispute that s 9 of the PCA was not applicable to the present case, as it only applied to offences under s 6 of the PCA involving agents. It was interesting that there was no similar provision made for s 5 of the PCA. However, having studied the provisions, I did not accept that it was a necessary extrapolation from this that it was a requisite element of a charge under s 5 to show that the receiver had the “power, right or opportunity” to carry out the corrupt act, or that he did or intended to do so.

162    Section 6 of the PCA deals with corrupt transactions involving agents. The law of agency adds an additional layer of complication as agents are by definition at least one level removed from the principal. It appeared to me that s 9 was specifically meant to close this gap, and it has no application to a charge framed under s 5 involving principals, where there is no such gap to deal with.

163    All in, I did not find the absence of evidence from Agus fatal to the Prosecution’s case.

164    In the same vein, I did not think it necessary for the Prosecution to prove that Aziz had actually arranged with Agus to show favour to AIG and Liberty. Although I would note that there was in fact some evidence of this in his statements. I deal with this in \[170\] below.

165    For completeness, I went on to consider the issue of whether Agus knew the purpose for which these payments were being given to him. According to the statements from Aziz:

> (a)     Agus had told him that he “_wanted a cut_” from the PB commission to cover his “_operational costs_”.[^108] However, it was clear to Aziz that Agus wanted the money for himself, and Agus had told him that “_this was how things worked in Indonesia_.”[^109]

> (b)     Agus frequently chased Aziz to get the commission payments from James, even threatening at one point to “_switch off the system_” if the payments were delayed or refused.[^110]

> (c)     Aziz also confirmed in his statements that he always handed over to Agus the money earmarked for him.

166    In my view, there was very strong circumstantial evidence to find that Agus must have known why these payments were being made to him. These payments were clearly related to the PB sales, and there was no documentation at all for them. As the Labour Attaché of the Embassy, it was not likely that he would have received these payments, thinking that they were anything other than for the illicit purpose of getting his endorsement for allowing AIG and Liberty to go ahead to sell the PBs.

167    In any case, the issue of whether Agus knew the purpose for these payments, was really only relevant to the question of whether Agus was guilty of corruption. The guilt of the present accused persons must stand or fall on their own knowledge and intention, and not that of Agus. However, the analysis above was still relevant in so far as it was further support for the fact that the payments were made as a reward/inducement to Agus to accredit AIG and Liberty for the purpose of selling the PBs, and was therefore circumstantial evidence of the accused persons’ corrupt intentions.

### Third element: The payments were corrupt

168    Whether these payments were corrupt must be determined according to an objective inquiry, and based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man. (See _Chan Wing Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 721</span> at \[20\])

169    In my view, the intention to give money to the Labour Attaché in the Embassy in order for AIG and Liberty to be accredited to sell the PBs necessarily tainted the payment transactions with a corrupt element. This was a typical textbook example of corruption. At its heart, corruption seeks to stamp out such under the table dealings that undermine a free and fair market for all. Whether or not AIG or Liberty got accredited should be based on objective factors related to the purpose at hand e.g. merit of the companies’ proposals, their background and standing etc. It should certainly not be based on how much they were willing to pay as a personal benefit to Agus as this was not something related to the purpose behind the PB. Corruption poisons such business transactions and prevents optimal outcomes from being achieved.

170    With regard to the payments made to Aziz, I was also of the view that they were objectively corrupt. These payments served no purpose other than to reward/induce Aziz for “influencing/recommending” AIG and Liberty to be accredited. Aziz also admitted in his statement that after speaking to James, he had informed Agus that James was willing to give a commission for every successful PB sold, and after hearing this, Agus then said that they should start off the programme[^111]. AIG later went on to be the first insurance company to be accredited. The evidence therefore showed that Aziz did in fact go on to “influence” Agus for the accreditation process.

#### Not clear that there was a breach of the AIG Agent’s Code of Conduct

171    I should state that I was not entirely convinced that James had breached Clause 8 of the “Duty to Customer” section of the AIG Agent’s Code of Conduct[^112]. On a plain reading of the document, it was not clear that the Embassy or Agus would qualify as a client or prospect within the meaning of the clause. As such, I gave James the benefit of the doubt, and did not find that he had breached this Code such as to render his actions automatically corrupt.

172    Nevertheless, based on my analysis above, it was clear to me that even leaving aside this Code of Conduct, the nature of the payments made were in fact objectively corrupt.

### Fourth element: The accused persons knew that what they were doing was corrupt

173    The most direct evidence for this could be found in their investigative statements, where they admitted knowing that what they were doing was corrupt.

> (a)     In exhibit P4 at \[49\], Benjamin stated “_I am now asked by the recording officer if I know that it is wrong to give someone in the Indonesia Embassy money in exchange for awarding the accreditation to AIG and Liberty. I wish to state that yes, it is wrong to do so and it is a bribe_.”

> (b)     In exhibit P28 at \[50\], James was asked if he knew it was wrong to give 20% of the commission to Agus, and he replied “_Yes_.” When asked why he thought it was wrong, he stated, “_Agus was an embassy staff and the 20% was a bribe to him because AIG and Liberty were the accredited insurance company that can issue the letter of Guarantee or in layman’s term, the $6,000/- Indonesian bond_.”

> (c)     In exhibit P20 at \[21\], Aziz was asked why he thought James was uncomfortable giving money directly to Agus, and he stated, “_He did not want to be seen bribing Agus. I was also not feeling comfortable to help him give as I did not want to be involved_.”

174    With regard to the payments made by James to Aziz, there was no express acknowledgment in the statements that they both knew this arrangement was wrong, but given their knowledge that the payment to Agus was wrong and corrupt (a “bribe”), they must have known that these payments to Aziz were corrupt as well. The nature of the payments was the same. Aziz was paid because he had told James that he was in a position to influence Agus’ decision to accredit AIG and Liberty. See \[145\] above\]

175    In so far as the mirror charges under s 5(_a_) and 5(_b_) of the PCA faced by James and Aziz were concerned, I was therefore satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to show that James had given gratification to Agus and Aziz in the amounts as stated in the charges, as reward for Agus showing favour to AIG and Liberty in accreditation, and as reward for Aziz arranging with Agus to show favour to AIG and Liberty in the accreditation respectively.

### Aziz had corruptly sought gratification from Tokio Marine

176    The evidence for this could be found in the evidence from PW9 David and PW10 Choo, as well as in Aziz’s own statements. According to PW9 David and PW10 Choo, Aziz had requested for a commission of 40% of the premium for Agus and himself, when they approached him regarding accreditation. Both PW9 David and PW10 Choo understood that Aziz was asking them for a bribe.

177    Aziz also confirmed in his statement[^113] that he had asked for a commission of 40%, and that this was based on Agus’ instructions to him. He knew that this was akin to the money which Agus was receiving from James. For the reasons I have given above, the payments given by James were corrupt in nature. This was the same type of payment Aziz had sought from PW9 David and PW10 Choo. Furthermore, Aziz also knew that PW9 David and Michael understood this to be a form of bribe in order to be accredited.

178    Aziz went on to explain in his statement that Agus had asked for a high commission as he wanted to deter Tokio Marine since AIG and Liberty were not on good terms with AVA Insurance, which was affiliated with Tokio Marine. Did this mean that in fact that Aziz had no corrupt intent when he sought for these payments?

179    If this was the real intention behind Aziz’s request to PW9 David and PW10 Choo, I would have a real doubt as to whether he had the necessary corrupt intent. If there had been no further evidence on this point, I might have had no reason to reject this portion in his statement. However, I was unable to accept that this was in fact the case, as it did not sit well at all with the evidence from PW9 David and PW10 Choo that Aziz had followed up with this request to ask for updates, even sending a message to PW9 David when he was away on holiday to ask for an update. This was certainly not the actions of someone who had no real intention for any payments to be made.

180    It is trite law that a court does not have to accept the contents of an accused’s statement wholesale. Both the incriminating and exculpatory parts of a mixed statement should be considered by a court in determining where the truth lay. In fact, where appropriate, a court could rely on the incriminating portions as being more likely to be true while the excuses/exculpatory portions might not carry the same weight. See _Chan Kin Choi v PP_ \[1991\] SLR(R) 111 at \[34\] and \[35\].

181    As it stood, the evidence for PW9 David and PW10 Choo on this aspect was unchallenged, and Aziz did not take the stand to clarify his intentions. The request for a bribe from Tokio Marine was also in line with the rest of the evidence on the entire corrupt enterprise. The idea that Aziz had sought this payment in order to deter Tokio Marine from the PB business was the one which was at odds with the evidence, and without any further substantiation, and in the face of contradictory evidence from PW9 David and PW10 Choo, I found it difficult to accept. I therefore found that Aziz had the requisite corrupt intent when he sought for these payments as gratification for Agus and himself, and the charge DAC 938439-2018 was therefore made out.

### Benjamin had intentionally aided Aziz to solicit gratification for Agus

182    I accepted that Benjamin’s role was fairly limited, and was really just that of introducing James to Aziz. The problem was that he had made that introduction, knowing full well what Aziz was seeking to arrange.

183    As I have set out above, I was satisfied that the payments Aziz was seeking from James were corrupt in nature, and Benjamin according to his statements, knew this.

184    When asked why he facilitated the whole scheme when he knew it was wrong to give money to someone in the Embassy in exchange for accreditation, his explanation was, “_I did not think it through at that time and to me, it is how things work in Indonesia_.”[^114]

185    With this in mind, the evidence is that Benjamin went ahead to contact James, informing him that this was a deal involving the Embassy and that commission would have to be paid to Aziz and “_the group of people he was working with at the Embassy_”.[^115] Benjamin also admitted to having told James that if no commission was given to Aziz, the deal would be off.[^116]

186    Benjamin did not give evidence on the stand, and his statements were therefore unchallenged. There was no reason not to accept the contents of his statements as true, and to place full weight on them.

187    Given these circumstances, I was of the view that Benjamin had intentionally aided the seeking of gratification by Aziz, by introducing James to him. In particular, Benjamin had specifically alerted James to this request, and also later conveyed back to Aziz that James was agreeable to paying the commission, before linking the two of them together. This was clearly abetting by intentionally aiding.

### Conclusion on convictions

188    On the weight of the accused persons’ statements and their decision not to give evidence in their own defence, I found that the Prosecution had proven all the charges against the accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted them accordingly.

## Sentence

189    The Accused persons were all untraced.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

190    The Prosecution asked for the following global sentences to be imposed on the Accused persons:

> (a)     Benjamin: At least 3 months’ imprisonment

> (b)     James: At least 24 months’ imprisonment

> (c)     Aziz: At least 26 months’ imprisonment

193    The Prosecution also sought a penalty under s 13 PCA against Aziz for the sum of $21,363.30, and high fines against James and Benjamin of $21,363.30 and $5,340.83 respectively, to disgorge their personal benefits arising from this corrupt arrangement.

194    In submitting for the proposed sentences, the Prosecution highlighted the need for general deterrence and relied on the following points:

> (a)     The present case involved a foreign public official, and this has been held by the High Court in _PP v Tan Kok Ming Michael & other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 926</span> (“_Michael Tan_”) to be a specific aggravating factor, warranting a starting point of a custodial term. This is because public interest is involved in such cases, which threaten Singapore’s international reputation for incorruptibility and risk fostering a culture of corruption here. Specifically for the present case involving the Labour Attaché from the Embassy, the Prosecution also pointed out the potential of damage to Singapore’s relations with Indonesia.

> (b)     Corruption involving financial institutions such as AIG and Liberty has the potential to impact Singapore’s global financial standing.

> (c)     The Accused persons were motivated entirely by self-interest and greed, and had personally benefitted by sums of $21.363.30 each for James and Aziz, and $5,340.83 for Benjamin. The gratification paid out to Agus was also sizeable ($71,211).

> (d)     The offences were sustained and persistent, and carried out over a four month period from March to June 2018.

> (e)     The offences were highly premeditated and difficult to detect, as the Accused persons had also taken surreptitious steps to avoid detection, such as the use of vomit bags and envelopes for the money, and kept no documentary records.

> (f)     There was an abuse of trust by James as he was an agent representing AIG and Liberty and was supposed to have guarded the integrity of the process and ensure compliance with their policies. AIG and Liberty’s reputations were damaged after these corruption offences came to light.

195    In reference to the sentencing precedents, the Prosecution relied on the facts involving Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael (“_Kaur_”), which was dealt with in _Michael Tan_, as a useful starting point, as it also involved the bribing of a foreign public official. While acknowledging that the facts in _Kaur_ were more aggravated than in the present case, the Prosecution pointed out that the offender in _Kaur_ had voluntarily disgorged the gratification and pleaded guilty to the charges.

196    In addition, the Prosecution also suggested that the case of _PP v Chew Hoe Soon_ (DAC No. 916888 of 2017 and others) (“_Chew Hoe Soon_”) as cited in _Michael Tan_ could be used as a baseline. In that case, the offenders had bribed police and Customs officers from Malaysia over a period of about three and a half years[^117], involving a total sum of about $92,000. However, there was no direct financial benefit to the offenders, and they had been “arm-twisted” into giving the bribes, as they were essentially the victims of extortionate demands from the police and customs officers. To that extent, the present case was more aggravated. In _Chew Hoe Soon_, the main offender (“Chew”) received a global term of about nine months’ imprisonment, while the other offender (“Tok”) got a global term of about six months’ imprisonment.

197    The Prosecution further submitted that no distinction ought to be made between the charges involving gratification paid to Agus (“the Agus-related charges”), and those involving gratification paid to Aziz (“the Aziz-related charges”), as they were both tainted by the same corruption arrangement involving a foreign public official. There was, as such, no “private sector” corruption in the present case.

198    With regard to Aziz’s charge involving the soliciting of gratification from Tokio Marine, the Prosecution asked for at least two months’ imprisonment, and cited the case of _PP v Su Fengxian_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 40</span> (“_Su Fengxian_”), involving an attempt to bribe an official of the Singapore Table Tennis Association.

199    With regard to the proposed sentence for Benjamin, the Prosecution acknowledged his limited role compared to James and Aziz, but pointed out that he went into this corrupt scheme with his eyes open and that the arrangement would not have come to pass if not for him. The case precedent of _PP v Tok Teck Hoe_ (DAC No. 916950 of 2017 and others) (“_Tok Teck Hoe_”) as cited in _Michael Tan_, was relied upon by the Prosecution.

### Mitigation by Benjamin

200    Benjamin mitigated on his own behalf, and asked for a fine to be imposed. He emphasized his limited role in the arrangement, and that he had been of the view that this was a “good and honourable” programme. In addition he claimed that he had assumed that diplomats would respect the law of the land and that procedures would be followed and it was on that basis that he made the introduction to James. He argued that he should not be faulted for making that assumption.

201    Benjamin pointed out that he did not “facilitate” as the offender in _Tok Teck Hoe_ had done i.e. he had not helped to hand over the bribes, and he was also facing far less charges than Tok (who faced a total of 38 charges).

202    Benjamin also highlighted that his role was essentially the same as Samad, but Samad was not prosecuted at all.

203    Finally, he asserted that he was only paid a sum of about $3,500, and not $5,340.83.

### Mitigation by James

204    Counsel for James suggested that a global term of about 11 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate, with the breakdown as follows:

205    Counsel for James submitted that the facts of the present case were more analogous to the offender in _Michael Tan_, rather than _Kaur_. He pointed out that _Kaur_ was a much more egregious case as:

> (a)     The offender in _Kaur_ was the foreign public official involved, and was employed by the United States (“US”) government as a lead contract specialist of the US Navy. She held a position that had substantial trust, responsibility and accountability to the US government.

> (b)     The offender in _Kaur_ had initiated the disclosure of confidential information of the US Navy to a commercial entity for her own financial benefit. The potential harm involved matters of national security.

> (c)     The offences took place over a seven year period (2006 to 2013), and the total gratification the offender received amounted to S$130,278.24.

206    On the other hand, _Michael Tan_ involved a total gratification sum of about $30,000 and an offending period of about three months. The foreign public official targeted was the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency and the subject matter was in relation to the sabotage of a rival company. There were no matters of national security involved. The offender in _Michael Tan_ received four months’ imprisonment.

207    Counsel for James also pointed out that the individual sentences proposed by the Prosecution were unfair and arbitrary, and did not appear to be mathematically proportionate in relation to the gratification amounts in the individual charges. It was also unfair that the Prosecution should be proposing a term of 12 months’ imprisonment for a charge involving a sum of $15,400, when the offender in _Kaur_ received 16 months’ imprisonment for a charge involving $50,000.

208    In addition, counsel proposed that a distinction ought to be made between the Agus-related charges and the Aziz-related charges. As Aziz was a private citizen, it was more appropriate to apply private sector corruption sentencing precedents to the Aziz-related charges and that these charges fell within the first category of corruption as identified in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (“Romel”) at \[26\], and that in fact non-custodial sentences were appropriate as the total gratification received by James was less than $30,000. Counsel therefore suggested that a high fine in the region of $22,000 would suffice, and alternatively light custodial terms as suggested in the table at \[204\] above.

209    In response to the other aggravating points raised by the Prosecution, counsel noted that:

> (a)     The period of offending in the present case was significantly shorter than that in _Kaur_.

> (b)     James did not hold any position of trust and he was just an ordinary insurance agent representing AIG and Liberty. In any case, he did not prioritise his personal interests over that of AIG and Liberty, as the PB business in fact advanced the interests of his principals.

210    In mitigation, counsel highlighted that James was the main breadwinner of his family and as a result of this case, he lost his insurance licence in 2018. He had also cooperated fully with investigations. Counsel submitted that based on his current financial circumstances, he had been “punished” sufficiently and a fine in addition to imprisonment was unnecessary.

### Mitigation by Aziz

211    Counsel for Aziz suggested that a global term of about 11 months’ and 1 week’s imprisonment would be appropriate, with the breakdown as follows:

212    Counsel for Aziz submitted that while _Kaur_ was an appropriate stating point given the similar involvement of a foreign public official, the Prosecution’s calibration of sentences was erroneous and failed to properly account for the much higher severity of the offences in _Kaur_. In particular, counsel highlighted the following:

> (a)     The level of premeditation and sophistication in the present case was not high and certainly not at the same level as in _Kaur_. In any case, there was no evidence to indicate that Aziz was involved in making the arrangements involving the use of vomit bags and envelopes to pass the money.

> (b)     The quantum of gratification as well as the duration of offending were much lower than in _Kaur_.

> (c)     There was no abuse of trust and authority in the present case. Aziz’s role was mostly limited to being a middleman between James and Agus, and there was very little evidence that he had any significant influence over the accreditation process. Agus was clearly the instigator and the one calling the shots. He was also the one who received the lion’s share of the bribes.

213    In response to the Prosecution’s reliance on _Chew Hoe Soon_, counsel pointed out that in fact Chew appeared to have paid Customs officers because he had committed Customs offences (as indicated in \[128\] of _Michael Tan_), and therefore the characterisation of the offenders there as having been “arm-twisted” or “victims” was erroneous. The facts of _Chew Hoe Soon_ were therefore similar to, and not significantly more egregious than, the present case.

214    Counsel for Aziz also submitted that a distinction ought to be drawn between the Agus-related charges and the Aziz-related charges. The aggravating feature of a foreign public official was only present in relation to the Agus-related charges, but not the Aziz-related charges.

215    In relation to the penalty requested for by the Prosecution, counsel pointed out that a sum of $6,807 had been seized from Aziz when he was arrested, and this should therefore be deducted from the penalty sum. The appropriate figure should therefore be $14,556.30 instead.

### Court’s decision on sentence

216    The punishment prescribed for an offence under s 5(_a_) or 5(_b_) of the PCA is a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years or both.

217    There was no dispute that the present offences involved the giving of gratification to a foreign public official and that this was a specific aggravating factor as identified in _Michael Tan_. For the reasons as set out by Justice Hoo Sheau Peng in _Michael Tan_, the starting point in this case was a custodial term.

218    In my view, this was also true of the Aziz-related charges. In this set of charges, the bribes were given to Aziz for his personal benefit and therefore did not directly involve Agus. Nevertheless, the purpose of the bribes in the Agus-related charges and the Aziz-related charges was the same – to get the Indonesian Labour Attaché to accredit AIG and Liberty for the purpose of issuing the PBs. There was no other purpose to giving the bribes to Aziz. In other words, the element of bribing a foreign public official was present in all these charges, and whether the monies were meant for Agus or Aziz did not change that. It was all part of the same corrupt arrangement. I was therefore unable to agree that the Aziz-related charges were so distinctly different in nature as to be treated as another category of corruption altogether.

219    The same could be said of the single charge faced by Benjamin. He had abetted the corrupt arrangement to bribe the Indonesian Labour Attaché.

220    I was therefore satisfied that the starting point for all the charges faced by the three Accused persons was a custodial term, and there was no reason to go below this starting point.

221    The next question was what the appropriate terms of imprisonment should be.

#### Mirror charges against James and Aziz

222    I first deal with the mirror charges faced by James and Aziz, involving the giving and receiving of gratification on multiple occasions to both Agus and Aziz.

223    There were not many sentencing precedents with similar facts, but I found guidance from the three cases helpfully alluded to by the Prosecution and Defence counsels - _Michael Tan_, _Kaur_ and _Chew Hoe Soon_.

224    I was in general agreement with Defence counsels that the facts in _Kaur_ were significantly more aggravated than in the present case, and to that extent, it had limited use as a sentencing precedent. The Prosecution itself conceded this in oral submissions.

225    Not only was the amount of gratification higher (about $130,278.24 in total) and the period of offending significantly longer (about seven years) in _Kaur_, but the offender herself was _the_ foreign public official who was bribed. She was the one who had abused the trust placed in her by her office and who appeared to have initiated the payment of gratification in at least some of the charges.

226    This was very different from the facts in the present case. The total amount of gratification in the charges was about $92,000, not including the amounts which had been paid to Benjamin and Samad. The period of offending was about four months, and there was no similar abuse of trust as in _Kaur_. While there may have been some abuse of trust on the part of James when he went ahead with the arrangement without the knowledge or consent of his principals, AIG and Liberty, this was certainly not in the same league as in _Kaur_. In any case, apart from a possible damage to reputation, AIG and Liberty did not appear to suffer any loss from the arrangement. I therefore did not think that there was any abuse of trust in the present case serious enough to affect the sentence.

227    Even taking into account the fact that the offender in _Kaur_ had pleaded guilty and voluntarily disgorged the amount of gratification, I was of the view that the appropriate sentences in the present case should rightly be much lower than the sentence imposed on the offender in _Kaur_. For her three proceeded charges, the offender in _Kaur_ received 16 and 19 months’ imprisonment respectively for two charges involving $50,000 each, and 14 months’ imprisonment for the remaining charge involving $14,977.74. The global term imposed was 40 months’ imprisonment. In their written submissions, the Prosecution had relied on the charge involving $14,977.74[^118], for which the offender in _Kaur_ received a sentence of 14 months, to calibrate the sentences for the present case. I would highlight, however, that in relation to this charge, Justice Hoo had taken into account the additional aggravating factor of the degree of initiation of the corrupt transaction[^119]. In relation to this charge, the offender in _Kaur_ had repeatedly asked for the gratification, and even made certain disclosures to prompt the payment. Justice Hoo held that this was aggravating. However, this was not a feature of the present case.

228    Turning to the facts in _Michael Tan_ and _Chew Hoe Soon_, I was of the view that they were more similar to the present case.

229    In _Michael Tan_, the offender had passed a sum of $10,000 to one Owyong for the purpose of bribing officers from the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (“APMM”) to detain a vessel belonging to his competitor. Two other similar charges (involving $10,000 each) were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. The period of offending (even taking into account the TIC charges) was about three months. For the proceeded charge, the offender pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a term of four months’ imprisonment.

230    In _Chew Hoe Soon_, Chew had paid a total of $86,000 to a maritime commander of the APMM over a period of three and a half years, to avoid having checks conducted on his vessels. He had also paid a total of $6,000 to an officer of the Royal Malaysia Customs Department to avoid having checks conducted on his vessels which were engaged in customs offences. These payments were made at the initiation of the APMM and Customs officers, and not by the offender. Chew pleaded guilty to nine charges under s 6(b) of the PCA and was sentenced to a total of 36 weeks’ imprisonment for the PCA charges.[^120]

231    The Prosecution submitted that the accused persons in the present case were twice as culpable as Chew, highlighting that (a) Chew had been pressured to make the payments so that they would not be harassed by the officers and (b) he had no direct financial benefit from the arrangement. This was different from the present case, as (a) the accused persons had not been pressured in any way to enter into the corrupt arrangement and they had volunteered to enter it on the motivation of greed, and (b) they had direct financial benefits from the arrangement.

232    I accepted the point that there may well have been some pressure on Chew to pay the bribes to the officers, pressure of which was absent in the present case, and to that extent the present case was more aggravated. However, I was not convinced that the culpability of Chew and the accused persons were as starkly different as the Prosecution made it out to be. Chew had not initiated the giving of the bribe but neither had the accused persons. Even when Aziz asked for the bribes, it was under instructions from Agus. While there did not appear to be a direct financial benefit to Chew from the payments of the bribes, he was allowed to continue plying his business in the area because of the bribes, and perhaps even continuing to engage in customs offences undisturbed. I did not think this was very different from the present case, where the giving of the bribes allowed the accused persons to engage in the business of selling PBs and therefore earning commission as a result.

233    On the whole, I was of the view that the sentences for the mirror charges faced by James and Aziz ought to be calibrated more closely to the sentences in _Michael Tan_ and _Chew Hoe Soon_ than in _Kaur_.

234    Taking the above into account, as well as the fact that the accused persons had claimed trial and not made any voluntarily disgorgement of their benefits, I was of the view that the following individual sentences against both James and Aziz for the mirror charges were appropriate:

#### The charge against Aziz for soliciting gratification from Tokio Marine

235    In relation to the Tokio Marine charge, I accepted that _Su Fengxian_ was a relevant precedent to refer to. The offender in _Su Fengxian_ had tried to bribe an official from the Singapore Table Tennis Association, while Aziz had solicited bribes for a foreign public official. It was clear to me that the offence in the present case was of a higher severity and the sentence should reflect that.

236    Given that the offender in _Su Fengxian_ had claimed trial and been handed a 6 week imprisonment term, I was of the view that a term of two months’ imprisonment in the present case would be appropriate and justified.

#### Global custodial terms against James and Aziz

237    To summarise, these are the custodial terms I am imposing on James and Aziz.

238    I agreed with the Prosecution’s proposal for the number of sentences to run consecutively against each accused person, and accepted that this appropriately reflected the culpability of each accused person, and did not breach the one-transaction rule or the totality principle. I note that the accused persons have also not disputed the number of, and which charges, to run consecutively.

#### Sentence against Benjamin

239    Given the involvement of a foreign public official in the corrupt arrangement which Benjamin had helped to initiate, I accepted that a custodial term was warranted against him. However, his role was fairly limited and he did not appear to have any substantial role beyond the initial stage. In this respect, his role was much less significant than that of the offender in _Tok Teck Hoe_, who had assisted in making the arrangements for the gratification payments and was involved in dealing with $80,000 of the bribe amounts. _Tok_ pleaded guilty and received individual sentences ranging from 6 weeks to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

240    Bearing the above in mind, I was of the view that a sentence of 1 month was appropriate and justified against Benjamin.

#### Penalty against Aziz

241    The amount of gratification Aziz received and which was reflected in the charges for which he has been convicted, is a sum of $21,363.30. This is the amount for which the Prosecution is seeking an order under s 13 PCA.

242    Counsel for Aziz did not dispute this, but contended that any order under s 13 PCA should take into account the fact that a sum of $6,807 was seized from Aziz when he was arrested.

243    I noted that from this amount of $6,807, only a sum of $3,063.48[^121] was due to Aziz. As such, I was of the view that it was appropriate for only this sum to be applied towards the penalty under s 13 PCA.

244    A penalty of $21,363.30 should therefore be imposed against Aziz under s 13 PCA, with the sum of $3,063.48 to be taken from the amount which had been seized from Aziz at the point of arrest, and applied towards the payment of this penalty. The amount remaining against Aziz was $18,299.82.

#### Fines against Benjamin and James

245    Given that Benjamin and James had also directly profited from the corrupt arrangement, it was appropriate for fines to be imposed against them to disgorge these profits.

246    It was clear from the arrangement that James and Aziz were supposed to get the same amount from the commission payments. From the charges, Aziz had received an amount of $21,363.30 from the commission payments, and I also accepted that this was the amount which James would have profited from the arrangement as well and that he should therefore be fined accordingly.

247    Benjamin claimed that he only received about $3,500 from the arrangement. This was consistent with the statements he provided to the CPIB.[^122] However, even in his statements, he could not recall exactly the amounts which were transferred to him on each occasion.

248    In this respect, I found that the evidence from James with regard to the pay-outs to each party was more reliable, as it was based on his own commission payment documents as well as bank documents. According to James’ statement at exhibit P30[^123], a total amount of $4,574.96[^124] was paid out to Benjamin. As such, I was satisfied this was the appropriate amount of any fine meted out against him.

#### Conclusion

249    In conclusion, these are the global sentences I imposed on the accused persons:

250    I was of the view that the sentences imposed were appropriate and justified in the circumstances.

[^124]: A remaining sum of $765.87 was within the amount which was given to Aziz on 28 and 29 June. See P30 at \[61\]. However, as this could be part of the $6,807 which was seized from Aziz, the benefit of the doubt should be given to Benjamin that he never actually received this sum.
