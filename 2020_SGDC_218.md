\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9793/2020/01.\]

15 September 2020

### District Judge Ong Luan Tze:

1       The Accused, 67 years old, pleaded guilty before me to the following three charges, committed on or before 20 September 2018:

> (a)     consuming _methamphetamine_, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**MDA**”), without authorisation under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (“consumption charge”);

> (b)     having in his possession not less than 6.12 grams of vegetable matter which was analysed and found to contain _5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA_, a “Class A” controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA, without authorisation under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 8(a) and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (“possession charge”); and

> (c)     having in his possession utensils intended for the consumption of a controlled drug, to wit, one glassware with one attachment and one pipe, and three pipes each with one attachment, without authorisation under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 9 and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA (“possession of utensils charge”).

2       Another charge for attempting to possess not less than 3.60 grams of _methamphetamine_ under s 8(a) read with s 12 and punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       The Accused admitted to the statement of facts without qualification, and was found guilty and convicted. In sentencing, the Accused asked to be put on probation. The Prosecution asked for the usual custodial term.

4       After hearing parties on mitigation and sentencing, I imposed a global sentence of **nine months’ imprisonment**.

5       The Accused is appealing against his sentence, and is currently out on bail pending appeal.

## Statement of Facts

6       The salient points in the Statement of Facts, to which the Accused admitted without qualification, are set out below.

7       On 20 September 2018 at about 11.10 p.m., acting on information received, a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) conducted operations at the the Accused’s residence. The Accused was present at the residence, and opened the door for the officers.

8       A search of the residence was conducted in the view and presence of the Accused, and one packet containing vegetable matter (“marked BCD-5”) and the utensils forming the subject matter of the possession of utensils charge were found and seized.

9       The Accused was arrested at about 11.20 p.m. and brought back to the CNB office at the Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional Headquarters, together with the seized exhibits.

10     On the same day, the Accused provided two bottles of urine samples which were subsequently analysed and found to contain _methamphetamine_.

11     The Accused admitted that he consumed “Ice” (a street name for _methamphetamine_), and had last done so on the morning of his arrest. He had also consumed “Ice” on 13 and 16 September 2018. He consumed “Ice” by placing it in a glass pipe attached to a bottle filled with water. He would then heat the bottom of the glass pipe with a lighter and inhale the smoke emitted from the heated “Ice”.

12     He further admitted that he had obtained the “Ice” from one Mohamad Afiq Bin Mohamad Anuwar (“Afiq”), whom he first met on 12 September 2018.

13     In the course of investigations, the Accused admitted that he consumed “Ice” because he enjoyed it, and would have continued consuming “Ice” if he had not been arrested.

14     The seized packet marked “BCD-5” was later found to contain 6.12 grams of vegetable matter, which was analysed and found to contain _5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA_ and its fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group. _5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA_ and its fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group are Class A controlled drugs listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

15     The Accused admitted to ownership and possession of “BCD-5”, and admitted that it was intended for his own consumption. He further admitted that he had purchased “BCD-5” from Afiq, and had last consumed “mushroom” (of which _5fluoro-MDMB-PINACA_ and its fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group are active ingredients) on 13 September 2018.

16     The utensils which had been seized from the Accused’s residence was one glassware with one attachment and one pipe (marked “BCD-1”), and three pipes with one attachment (marked “BCD-3”). Upon analysis, BCD-1 was found to be stained with _methamphetamine_, and “BCD-3” was found to be stained with _ketamine_ and _methamphetamine_.

17     The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume methamphetamine, have in his possession _5-fluoro-MDMB-PINACA_ and its fluoro positional isomers in the pentyl group, or have in his possession the said utensils.

## Antecedents

18     The Accused was untraced.

## Mitigation

19     The Accused is a 67 year old British national who relocated to Singapore from the United Kingdom to take up a teaching post in Hwa Chong Institution (“HCI”). He has lived in Singapore since 1986, and has been teaching under the Humanities Programme at HCI since 1989. He has a clean record and a strong support network of colleagues and ex-students, many of whom also wrote in testimonials in support of his mitigation.

20     In urging the court to call for a probation suitability report, counsel for the Accused relied heavily on the psychiatric assessment by Dr Ung Eng Khean, which diagnosed the Accused as suffering from three mental disorders – Insomnia Disorder, Adjustment Disorder and Personality Change due to Another Medical Condition. Dr Ung was of the view that there was a causal or contributory link between these disorders and the offences, in that they:

> (a)     impaired the Accused’s “ability to make conscious choices and to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, particularly, the severe consequences of illicit drug consumption” and

> (b)     the Accused’s drug consumption was “solely motivated by an effort to self-medicate his Insomnia Disorder and to cope with his Adjustment Disorder”.

21     Counsel also emphasized the background facts which gave rise to these mental disorders in the Accused. In December 2017, the Accused was involved in a serious automobile collision that led to his father’s passing. The Accused had been driving at the relevant time, and was thus consumed by grief and guilt. This was compounded by the fact that criminal proceedings were brought in the United Kingdom against the Accused for negligent driving in June 2018.

22     Following this accident, the Accused started to suffer from persistent insomnia, and his mental condition worsened. His personality also started to change, and he became more disinhibited in his behaviour.

23     It was in these circumstances that he struck up a conversation with a stranger sometime in September about his insomnia. The stranger then offered him _methamphetamine_ to help the Accused with his sleep troubles. On a reckless whim, the Accused then invited the stranger back to his house, where the stranger supplied him with _methamphetamine_, utensils for consuming the drugs, and a packet of ‘mushroom’ to act as a ‘downer’ after consuming _methamphetamine_.

24     Following his arrest and short stint in remand (of about two months), the Accused sought treatment for his Insomnia Disorder and went for bereavement counselling. He also started to find constructive ways to occupy his time, such as tutoring some of his ex-students’ children.

25     Counsel accepted that rehabilitation could take precedence over general and specific deterrence in drug related offences only where exceptional circumstances existed, and argued that the present case fell within this category. Some of the points he cited in support of this included the following:

> (a)     The Accused had an exemplary record all his life until the car accident in December 2017.

> (b)     The Accused was remorseful and had already spent two months in remand after he was first charged.

> (c)     The Accused’s mental conditions caused or contributed to the poor decision that formed the basis of the charges.

> (d)     These mental conditions and poor decisions that flowed from them, stemmed from the Accused’s failure to properly deal with the emotional aftermath of his father’s untimely death. The Accused was not found to have any antisocial traits, antisocial personality disorder, or history of conduct disorder.

> (e)     The Accused had since got his conditions under control and built up a strong support network. In fact, in the clarification report by Dr Jerome Goh of the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) dated 15 July 2020, Dr Goh confirmed that, while the Accused had been suffering from Adjustment Disorder around the time of the offences, he was no longer suffering from Adjustment Disorder at present.

> (f)     The Accused was not the “usual drug offender” who commits drug-related offences because of their social circles or curiosity. The Accused had made the poor decision to consume _methamphetamine_ because he was desperate to stop feeling sleepy while at work.

26     Counsel for the Accused therefore argued that the risk of re-offending was very low, and that the principle of deterrence was not as relevant because of the Accused’s mental condition. Rehabilitation should therefore take precedence and a probation report called for.

27     Counsel also suggested that if rehabilitation was no longer necessary because the Accused had since recovered from his mental disorders, then a suitable order to make might be a conditional or absolute discharge because there was no point in further punishing the Accused.

28     In the alternative, Counsel also suggested that a fine be imposed on the Accused, if probation was not found to be suitable. This was on the basis of the special circumstances of this case which, Counsel argued, should result in a much lighter sentence than the usual tariffs for drug offences.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

29     The Prosecution asked for a global term of 14 months’ imprisonment, based on the usual custodial terms meted out for such drug-related offences, albeit on the lower end of the range, as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.42%"> <col width="33.66%"> <col width="32.92%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eight months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">concurrent</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession charge</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Eight months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">consecutive</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession of utensils charge</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Six months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">consecutive</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

30     The Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) objected to the calling of a probation report, maintaining that deterrence was still the key sentencing consideration in the present case.

31     Referring to the psychiatric reports, the DPP pointed out that while they suggested that the disorders resulted in greater impulsivity and disinhibition on the part of the Accused, it was clear that he still appreciated the moral and legal wrongness of his actions. The DPP also highlighted that the drug offending was not opportunistic or committed only in a single instance. He had consumed _methamphetamine_ on three different occasions, and had told the police in the course of investigations that he enjoyed doing so and would have continued to do so if he had not been caught.

32     If the mental disorders merely impacted on the Accused’s ability to consider the risks of offending, then this was not sufficient to displace the principle of deterrence and no mitigating weight should be given in this regard[^1].

33     With regard to the issue of self medication, the DPP pointed out that it was clear in law that self medication was not an excuse or justification for taking controlled drugs, and that in any case this was contradicted by his statement to the police that he had taken the drugs because he enjoyed doing so.

34     The DPP acknowledged that the Accused had a clean record, and had spent two months in remand. She conceded that a downward adjustment could be made to the sentence to reflect this.

## Court’s decision

35     Deterrence, both general and specific, is generally the key sentencing consideration for drug offences, particularly for older offenders. The usual sentence for such drug offences is therefore a term of incarceration. In _Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 1</span> (“_Dinesh Singh_”), the High Court noted at \[59\] that the “consumption of drugs is a grave menace and an anathema to the fabric and well-being of society and must be uncompromisingly stamped out.” The High Court also made clear that “all drug offences involving the possession or consumption of Class A drugs inexorably attract custodial sentences, save in purely exceptional cases_._”

36     The key question was whether this case was so “purely exceptional” that this court should find that a non custodial sentence, such as probation, might be a suitable sentencing option instead.

37     I accepted that it was legally possible for the Accused to be sentenced to probation. The offences for which the Accused had been convicted were not offences “the sentence for which is fixed by law”, and as such would not fall foul of s 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed).

38     Nevertheless, I did not think that this case fell within the category of a “purely exceptional” case such as to displace the dominant sentencing consideration of deterrence

### The Accused’s psychiatric condition did not render deterrence less effective

39     The main factor which Counsel relied upon in making a case for probation, was the Accused’s mental condition at the time of the commission of the offences. There was no dispute between parties that the Accused did indeed suffer from at least an Adjustment Disorder at the relevant time, and I accepted this to be the case as well.

40     Psychiatric reports from both Dr Ung and Dr Goh from the IMH were tendered to court in support of this diagnosis.

41     However, I did not accept that the presence of a mental disorder necessarily meant that the principle of deterence ought to take a backseat. The existence of a mental disorder was a relevant factor in sentencing, but its mitigating value, and in particular whether it renders deterrence less effective, depends on a myriad of factors such as “causal link, the nature and severity of the mental disorder and the offender’s ability to make conscious choices and to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions.” (see _PP v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 69</span> (“_Chong Hou En_”) at \[25\]).

42     In _PP v Low Ji Qing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 769</span>, Sundaresh Menon CJ also summarised at \[44\] some of the applicable principles when sentencing an offender with a mental disorder, including the following two observations:

> (a)     In spite of the existence of a mental disorder on the part of the accused person, specific deterrence may remain relevant in instances where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence.

> (b)     If the serious psychiatric condition or mental disorder renders deterrence less relevant, where for instance the offender has a significantly impaired ability to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, then rehabilitation may take precedence.

43     Both Dr Ung and Dr Goh were of the opinion that the Accused’s mental disorders were contributory to the offences.

44     At \[49\] of his report dated 27 February 2019, Dr Ung gave the following two reasons for his conclusion that there was a causal or contributory link:

> (a)     The mental disorders[^2] impaired the Accused’s ability to make conscious choices and to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, particularly the severe consequences of illicit drug consumption; and

> (b)     The Accused’s drug consumption was solely motivated by an effort to self medicate his Insomnia Disorder and to cope with his Adjustment Disorder.

45     I had some difficulties with these two assertions. In the first place, it was not clear to me what was meant by the Accused’s “ability to make conscious choices” being impaired. Was he then making his choices unconsciously i.e. involuntarily? I assumed this was not the case, since there was nothing else in the report which would support a finding that the Accused’s actions had been involuntary. Furthermore, I would find it rather strange for the Accused to have _involuntarily_ made a very rational decision to consume the drugs with the sole motivation of self medicating.

46     With regard to the point that the disorders had also impaired the Accused’s ability to “appreciate the nature and quality of his actions, particularly, the severe consequences of illicit drug consumption”, I did not find this to be supported by the rest of the report. The report makes clear that the Accused was aware of what _methamphetamine_ was, given that his eldest daughter had been jailed for her role as a drug mule carrying _methamphetamine_ in 2011. When asked if he thought of the consequences of being caught for drug consumption, the Accused’s reply was “_I did not really dwell on the consequences… I was just interested to try it… It’s ludicrous being the father of someone arrested previously for carrying methamphetamine_.”[^3] Dr Ung appeared to have extrapolated from this to state the following at \[51\] of his report:

> Mr Burge’s behaviour on the night of 20 September 2018 is consistent with his pattern of greater impulsivity and disinhibition since January 2018 (after the accident). His purchase and consumption of drugs on the night in question was unplanned and took place because a random stranger at a bar had offered it to him. That behaviour was out of character for someone who had been law-abiding for the rest of his life and inconsistent with his personality before the accident when he had a strong disapproval for illegal drugs, having seen the consequences of the same suffered by his daughter. It seems to me that Mr Burge was acting without considering or fully appreciating the consequences of his actions, such that his ability to make conscious choices and to appreciate the nature and quality of his actions had been impaired.

47     The reasoning appeared to be that since the Accused did something so inexplicable, his reasoning must have been impaired, and he therefore must have failed to appreciate the consequences of his actions. However, I was not convinced at all that one necessarily followed the other. Just because someone does not consider the consequences does not mean that he is not able to. I did not find any basis in the report for concluding that the Accused was _not able to_ consider the consequences. In fact, in his supplementary report dated 29 July 2019, Dr Ung confirmed at \[10.1\] that the mental disorders would not obviate the Accused’s “ability to think rationally”, although it may contribute to greater impulsivity and poorer judgment.

48     In his report dated 5 May 2020, Dr Goh also found that the Accused suffered from a Adjustment Disorder around the time of the offences, and that this was “_contributory to his offences, with the cumulative stress over the preceding months impairing his judgment in the commission of the acts_.” In his further report dated 15 July 2020, Dr Goh reiterated that the Adjustment Disorder was causally linked to the offences in that the cumulative stress “_impaired his judgment and lowered his inhibitions in carrying out the acts despite appreciating that they were wrong_.” Dr Goh did not further explain how he came to this conclusion, and as such, I did not find his reports particularly helpful.

49     Nevertheless, from the information provided in the psychiatric reports, I noted the following:

> (a)     The Accused was still able to work and function in society at the material time;

> (b)     When faced with the issue of insomnia, he was able to use it to his advantage by engaging in activities (such as messaging his students, writing emails etc) at night where he felt most mentally active and productive;

> (c)     Knowing that he needed to manage the consequences of his insomnia and try to remain awake and alert during the day time, he began to self-medicate, first with over-the-counter products and later with controlled drugs; and

> (d)     After having bought and consumed methamphetamine from the stranger, he later had the sense and self-protection instinct to block this stranger on WhatsApp when the stranger tried to borrow money from him.

50     The conclusion that I drew from reading the reports was that the Accused became more impulsive and willing to take risks in the time leading up to the offences. He also became more eccentric, spoke more and slept less. However, he was still able to think rationally, and govern his actions accordingly. Importantly, he knew that it was legally wrong to consume or otherwise deal with a drug like methamphetamine, and he still went ahead to do it. It was a voluntary and deliberate decision, done in order to alleviate his insomnia condition. He may not have thought through the consequences, and to that extent, it was a bad decision. Nevertheless, the decision remained his.

51     In _Kanagaratnam_ at \[32\], Menon CJ observed that there were different types of “judgment” which could be said to be impacted by a psychiatric condition. It could be a knowledge of the legal rightness or wrongness of an action, an awareness of the moral rightness or wrongness of an action, or it could be the ability to consider the risks of offending balanced against its rewards. Menon CJ went on to state that “_lack of judgment in the latter sense can hardly be mitigating because every criminal hopes not to get caught and can be said to lack judgment in that respect_”.

52     It was clear to me that if there was any impact on the Accused’s judgment as a result of his mental disorders, it was his judgment in considering the risks of the offending i.e. he was more willing to take risks. As observed by Menon CJ, this was hardly mitigating. In any case, it was certainly not sufficient, in my view, to displace the need for deterrence in the present case.

### The consumption of controlled drugs to self medicate is not mitigating

53     It is trite that the use of controlled drugs to self medicate is not a mitigating factor. In _Leon Russel Francis v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 167</span>, the High Court cautioned at \[27\] against condoning the consumption of drugs for the relief of pain or discomfort arising from an existing medical condition. There are proper legal avenues for drugs to be administered or consumed for medical purposes, and there is no excuse for turning to the use of illicit drugs instead.

### Probation not appropriate

54     For the reasons set out above, I did not find that the Accused’s mental condition displaced the need for deterrence in this case. In my view, there was nothing else in mitigation which could reasonably allow me to consider that probation might still be appropriate.

55     The fact that the Accused had a clean record, was remorseful for his actions, and had a strong network of support from friends and colleagues, did not make his case an exceptional one.

56     The Accused is presently 67 years old. All the reasons for taking a rehabilitative approach in sentencing[^4] did not apply to him – (a) any scope for effective rehabilitation is minimal; (b) unlike in a case of a young offender, the number of years left for society to benefit from any rehabilitation on the Accused’s part is less; and (c) the Accused cannot claim not to have known better.

57     As such, I declined to call for a probation suitability report.

### Some leniency can be accorded in determining the length of imprisonment

58     All in, I was of the view that a custodial term was still warranted. Given the need for deterrence, the circumstances under which the offences were committed and the number of charges involved, I did not think that a fine would be appropriate.

59     While I did not accept that the Accused’s mental condition displaced the need for deterrence such as to warrant a non-custodial sentence being imposed altogether, I accepted that it remained a relevant factor in sentencing and in particular determining the length of custodial term to be imposed.

60     The reports indicate that the Accused had made a bad decision, and that perhaps he would not have made this bad decision if not for certain unfortunate events which unfolded in his life in the months leading up to the offences. To that extent, I agreed that the principle of specific deterrence could apply with reduced force, especially given the indication that the Accused has since recovered from, or is at least making good recovery progress from his psychiatric ailments. That said, I still considered that there was value in reminding the Accused of the painful result of not thinking about the consequences of his actions.

61     I further agreed that the two months which the Accused had earlier spent in remand ought to be taken into account in sentencing.

62     While the sentences for Class A drug offences (consumption and possession) was observed by the High Court in _Dinesh Singh_ to be in the range from six months to 18 months’ imprisonment, the usual tariff meted out in the State Courts is a range of eight to 12 months.

63     With regard to the charge for possession of utensils, the DPP pointed out that the usual range for such offences was four to six months’ imprisonment.

64     In the present case, having taking into account the Accused’s clean record, his mental condition at the time of the commission of the offences, and the two months he spent in remand, I was prepared to go below even the lower end of the range for each type of offence. However, I also had to take into account the fact that there were two separate Class A drugs involved. There was also another attempted possession charge taken into consideration.

65     All things considered, I imposed the following sentences:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="50.48%"> <col width="49.52%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption charge</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession charge</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession of utensils charge</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Three months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

66     I ordered the sentences for the consumption charge and the possession of utensils charge to run consecutively. The total sentence is a term of nine months’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

67     In the circumstances, I was of the view that a term of nine months’ imprisonment was appropriate and justified in the present case and imposed the same accordingly.
