2       The Accused admitted to and gave his consent for three other charges to be taken into consideration, namely:

> i.     DAC 922270/2018: a similar offence of absence from National Service duty without authority under section 48(1) of the Civil Defence Act for the period of 12 February 2018 to 4 July 2018;

> iii.     MAC 904991/2018: an offence of voluntarily causing hurt with common intention under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code, committed on 25 January 2017.

3       I sentenced the Accused to 21 months’ probation with conditions.

4       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with my order of probation has appealed against it.

5       I now set out my grounds of decision for the sentence.

#### The Statement of Facts

6       The following has been admitted by the Accused without any qualification.

7       The Accused is Muhammad Haziq bin Rosli, a 20-year old male Singaporean. He was serving his National Service at the material time of his arrest.

#### Facts pertaining to the 2nd charge DAC 917308/2018

#### a.   Involved parties

8       There are 2 groups involved. One is Khairuzan and his group comprising: Amanullah, Sabir, Hanafis, Irsyad, Putera, Bijay and Shamuel, collectively referred to as "Khairuzan's group".

9       The other group collectively referred to as “the Accused’s group” comprised the Accused and the following: M, Haikel, Haziq, Hanafi, Ridwan, Safari, Iman and B8 and B9 (two unknown males).

#### b.   First Information Report

10     On 1 July 2016 at 10.46 pm, a "Mr Low" called "999" and reported, "There are about 10 boys of mixed races, holding metal pipes and helmets and I think they are going to fight". The location of the incident was given as City Plaza, located at 810 Geylang Road, Singapore.

#### c.   Facts relating to the charge

11     On 30 June 2016, Khairuzan had a dispute with M over a "Facebook" message. The dispute arose because Khairuzan was unhappy with M because of his issues with Khairuzan's god-sister, who was M’s ex-girlfriend. Subsequently, on M's request, Haikel used M's Facebook account to get in touch with Khairuzan. The two decided to meet up the next day for a one-to-one fight.

12     On 1 July 2016, Khairuzan enlisted the help of his friends (Khairuzan’s group) to back him up in the event of a fight. M also enlisted the help of the Accused and the other accused persons (the Accused’s group) to back him up. All members of both groups were aware of the possibility that a fight would ensue, and were prepared to join in if need be.

13     On 1 July 2016 at or about 10.45 pm, the two groups met in the vicinity City Plaza. Hanafi had brought along and armed himself with a wooden stick. Likewise, several others among the accused persons and Khairuzan's group had also armed themselves with wooden sticks and metal poles. The Accused, however, was not armed with a weapon. On seeing this, Khairuzan became scared and fled to hide at the top floor of City Plaza.

14     The two groups confronted each other. The mood between the two groups was tense as various members of both groups were talking to each other aggressively. At one point, Haikel swung the wooden stick at Sabir's face, hitting him. This sparked off a fight between the two groups. Punches and kicks were exchanged. The weapons were also used by one or more of the accused persons against Khairuzan’s group. In particular, the Accused punched one or more of the victims in Khairuzan’s group.

15     Subsequently, Khairuzan’s group decided to flee. The Accused also picked up a wooden stick, which he found was discarded by one of the other accused persons and chased after members of Khairuzan’s group.

16     At some point during the chase, Hanafi and Safari, together with the Accused and some other accused persons targeted Bijay and chased him across the road towards another shopping mall, OneKM shopping centre. By then, the Accused had discarded the wooden stick. Bijay was subsequently assaulted by the abovementioned accused persons at the taxi stand of OneKM shopping centre. A crowd gathered to watch and several members of the public intervened to stop the assault. The accused persons then fled from the scene.

17     Several members of both groups underwent medical examination. Most did not suffer any injuries except the following:

> (a)     Irsyad suffered left arm soreness and left foot pain.

> (b)     Sabir suffered slight tenderness over his left maxillary area.

18     By virtue of the foregoing, the Accused was a member of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Khairuzan's group. In the prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly, the Accused and other members of the assembly had used violence on Khairuzan's group. The Accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under s 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Rev Ed). At the material time of the offence, the Accused was 18 years old.

#### Facts pertaining to the 1st charge DAC 902571/2018

19     The co-accused persons in this case are:

> Luqman, Haziq, Irfan, Sazali and Fazli.

20     The victims are:

> Christopher, Felix, and Daniel.

21     Christopher was serving his National Service at the material time. Felix is a German National while Daniel is an Australian National, and were in Singapore to visit Christopher as they were childhood friends. None of the victims know the accused persons.

22     On 13 January 2018 at about 3.20am, Luqman and his friend, known as ‘Hairul’, exited a pub known as “Canvas”, located at 20 Upper Circular Road, after a night of drinking. They headed towards Shah Alam Restaurant which was located at 20 Circular Road. Luqman and Hairul encountered the three victims, who were heading towards the opposite direction, along Circular Road outside BK Eating House, located at the junction of Circular Road and South Bridge Road.

23     When they walked past each other, Christopher and Hairul bumped into each other and Luqman became upset by this bump. A verbal dispute between Christopher and Luqman ensued.

24     Luqman became increasingly agitated. Despite efforts by the other two victims to prevent Luqman from approaching Christopher, Luqman pushed forward and punched Christopher on his face.

25     The two other victims pushed Luqman away from Christopher after the latter was punched. The victims then started to walk away. Luqman, who had fallen down because of the push, stood up and followed the victims. He struck a fighting stance. Daniel engaged Luqman and tried to fend him off. The confrontation escalated and the victims started to run away towards Clarke Quay MRT Station.

26     At this juncture, the Accused, Irfan and Fazli were walking along Circular Road towards Shah Alam restaurant, which was near BK Eating House. They, too, had just finished a drinking session at Canvas and were on their way to supper. The Accused, Irfan, and Fazli were acquaintances of Luqman as they all frequented Canvas. One of the victims then bumped into Irfan during the encounter. Irfan became upset by this and, seeing that Luqman was chasing the victims, Irfan also ran after the victims. The Accused and Fazli also followed suit.

27     At around this time, Sazali was walking along Circular Road with his friends. He, being a regular customer of Canvas as well, recognized Luqman and some of the co-accused persons as they were chasing the victims. He then decided to follow the Accused, Luqman, Fazli and Irfan as they chased after the victims.

28     Some other unknown persons also chased after the victims.

29     The Accused, the four co-accused persons and the unknown persons held the common object of causing hurt to the victims. The victims were chased from Circular Road to Clarke Quay MRT Station via Upper Circular Road. Along the way, the victims were kicked and punched by one or more of this group whenever the opportunity arose.

30     Upon reaching the entrance of Clarke Quay MRT Station, Christopher and Felix managed to enter a 24-hour convenience store located at The Central (i.e. a shopping mall adjacent to the entrance of the Clarke Quay MRT Station) to seek help. The staff of the convenience store pulled down the shutters of the store.

31     The Accused, the four co-accused persons and the unknown persons caught up with Daniel outside The Central. One or more of them then kicked and punched Daniel all over his body. After Daniel had fallen onto the ground, the group continued to kick and punch Daniel. In particular, the accused kicked Daniel’s body as he lay on the ground.

32     After about a few minutes, the attack on Daniel stopped. The Accused, the co-accused persons and the unknown persons left the scene before police arrival.

33     The victims subsequently sought treatment at the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”). Both Christopher and Daniel visited SGH on 13 January 2018, while Felix visited on 24 January 2018. They were found to have suffered the following injuries:

> (a)     Christopher: Nasal tenderness and oral mucosa wound in upper part left side and one loose tooth. He was diagnosed with having stable head injury with nasal contusion secondary to blunt assault. He was given 3 days’ medical leave from 13 January to 15 January 2018.

> (b)     Felix: Right lower chest wall has mild tenderness. He was diagnosed with minor injury.

> (c)     Daniel: Superficial scalp abrasions with bilateral periorbital ecchymoses, mild tenderness over the right angle of mandible and over the left lateral chest wall. He was diagnosed with minor head injury and multiple facial abrasions.

34     The Accused, together with the four co-accused persons and other unknown persons, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to the three victims, and he had therefore committed an offence punishable under s 147 of the Penal Code. At the material time of the offence, the Accused was 19 years old.

#### Facts pertaining to the 6th charge DAC 932195/2018

35     At the material time, the Accused was a full-time Civil Defence National Serviceman who had enlisted on 14 November 2017 and was posted to National Service Training Institute (NSTI) located at 91 Jalan Bahar, Singapore.

36     After the Accused was granted court bail on 30 August 2018, he did not report back for his NS duties on 6 September 2018 at NSTI until the day his court bail was revoked by Court 26, which was on 27 September 2018.

37     During the period of 6 September 2018 to 26 September 2018 (total duration of absence of 21 days), the Accused had neither a legitimate reason nor any medical exemption to justify his absence. Hence, he was, without authority, absent from his place of duty at NSTI. He has therefore committed an offence punishable under s 48(1) of the Civil Defence Act, Cap 42.

#### Antecedent records

38     The Accused has no antecedents.

#### Prosecution’s submissions

39     The Prosecution sought for the Accused to be sentenced to reformative training for a minimum detention period of 6 months, as the Accused had been assessed to be suitable to undergo a Level 1 intensity of intervention programmes.

40     The Prosecution started off their submission with applying the sentencing approach set out in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> (“Boaz Koh”) comprising a 2- stage enquiry. Applying the approach, the Prosecution submitted that given the Accused is still below 21 years old and the nature of the offences, rehabilitation would still be relevant sentencing principle. However, going into the second stage, deterrence should still come to the fore as the Accused had committed 2 serious offences of rioting.

41     The Prosecution pointed out that for the first rioting offence on 1 July 2016, the Accused was an active participant in the rioting. He had taken a wooden stick and chased and punched more than one victim. The other aggravating factors highlighted was that there were at least 2 victims who were hurt and weapons were used by the group. The violent incident would also have caused disturbance to the public as it had happened in full view of public at 10.45pm in a public mall attracting a crowd. The Prosecution submitted that such behaviour needs to be deterred.

42     The Prosecution submitted that they might have asked for a more lenient approach but for the fact that the Accused then reoffended with another rioting offence less than 2 years later.

43     The second rioting happened at another public place and the attack took place over a long distance when the victims were chased and kicked. The Accused was not a mere bystander but was an active participant who kicked one of the victims.

44     The Prosecution also highlighted that the Accused had another incident of violence which was the charge taken into consideration for voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.

45     On top of these violence-related offences, the Prosecution also pointed out that the absence without leave offences were committed by the Accused after he has already been charged in court for the rioting offences.

46     The Prosecution noted that the Accused has a younger brother, Irfan, who was involved in one of the rioting charges, namely the second rioting charge. He was placed on probation and was reportedly doing well. The Prosecution argued that the Accused in contrast to his brother, was clearly more culpable, having committed more offences of violence on 3 separate occasions, and hence should not be given the same treatment as the brother.

#### Mitigation

47     In mitigation, the Defence Counsel set out the following mitigating factors:

> i.     the Accused’s show of remorse through his guilty plea and he has been fully cooperative with the police.

> ii.     the circumstances leading to the commission of the offences:

>> a.        The first rioting offence

>> The Accused happened to be with a friend when they were asked to help out hence he had followed along.

>> b.        The second rioting offence

>> The Accused was again happened to be on the scene when he spotted his brother Irfan being bumped into by one of the victims. He became upset by the act of the victim and joined Irfan in chasing after the victim which led him to participate in the rioting offence.

>> c.        The Absence Without Leave (“AWOL”) offence

>> The Accused had gone to work during this period of time in order to help ease the financial stress on his family.

> iii.     The Accused had been in remand for almost 5 months and therefore had experienced the element of deterrence.

#### The Principles of Sentencing

48     This is the Accused’s first time in court for falling foul of the law. He was 20 years old at the time of sentencing for offences committed while he was 18 years old and 19 years old. The principle of sentencing for young offenders below 21 as set out in _Boaz Koh_ which is the 2 step enquiry would be applicable to the present case. The first step is to determine whether based on the nature of the offence and the harm caused that rehabilitation still maintains its primacy as a sentencing principle. If it does, then the 2nd step would be to determine whether probation or reformative training is the more suitable regime for the offender.

#### The Application of the Sentencing Principles

49     Both prosecution and defence are in agreement that for the first step of the enquiry, the predominant sentencing principle ought to be still rehabilitation. I agree that is so. The Accused’s rioting offences as well as the violence-related offences taken into consideration although serious, fortunately did not cause serious injuries to any of the victims. Most of them suffered mainly soreness and tenderness over the affected areas save for Christopher who had a loose tooth. As for the AWOL offence, the period was not extremely long. It is also noted that the Accused although committing this offence whilst on bail, did it out of a sense of trying to help his family with their financial difficulties.

50     On the 2nd step of the enquiry, I agree with Prosecution that based on the numerous offences committed by the Accused that is violence-related, a more deterrent element needs to be injected into the sentence to be meted out. The Accused had committed 3 separate acts of violence in the space of 2 years. He had clearly shown a propensity to resort to violence and poor self-regulation of his emotions. His AWOL offences also showed a lack of consequential thinking as he committed these offences after he had already been charged in court for the rioting offences.

51     Nonetheless, I note that the Accused had already been subjected to a strong dose of deterrence brought about by his remand of 5 months by the time he was sentenced. In fact, on closer examination of the history of the case from the court records, I realised that the Accused had actually been remanded for a much longer period of 221 days i.e. over 7 months as follows:

> i.     7 days from 20 to 26 January 2018 for purpose of investigations.

> ii.     61 days from 7 July to 5 September 2018 as he could not raise bail.

> iii.     153 days from 27 September 2018 to 26 February 2019 as bail was revoked.

52     The Prosecution tried to argue that the remand was the result of the Accused’s own doing due to his reoffending and should not be used to change what is an appropriate sentence. I disagree. Periods of remand are usually taken into consideration as a matter of course when backdating sentences of imprisonment or in calibrating the sentence to be imposed. This is so regardless of whether an offender was in remand right from the moment he was charged in court or subsequently when he re-offended and bail was either raised or revoked. An offender should not be punished further for failure to be bailed out.

53     I also found it significant that the Accused has been found to be suitable to undergo a Level 1 intensity of reformative training based on his rehabilitative needs. Generally, Level 1 intensity of programmes, which requires a shorter detention period of 6 months instead of 12 months, is prescribed for an offender with less deep seated issues to be addressed. The fact that Level 1 intensity is recommended for the Accused is therefore a positive sign that the Accused showed good potential for rehabilitation.

54     This good potential for rehabilitation is consistent with the recommendation for probation in the Probation Report. I found that the Accused has been sufficiently punished and it is time for the Accused to focus more on rehabilitation within the community he would eventually return to. The Probation Report has put up a strong case for why he can be rehabilitated within the community by highlighting the following positive factors:

> i.     Mother and siblings’ insights into the Accused’s needs and struggles. There was verbalised openness to improve parenting and supervision indicating a strong familial support for the Accused’s rehabilitation;

> ii.     The Accused’s period of remand and his grandfather’s death during the same period had invoked reflection on his behaviours;

> iii.     The Accused presented as an individual open and willing to receive intervention; and

> iv.     The Accused expressed willingness to work towards staying constructively engaged.

55     I also found that the probation conditions recommended which will last 21 months, comprehensive addressing the following risk factors in the Accused:

> i.     Poor consequential thinking and respect for the law;

> ii.     Negative peer influence and misguided peer loyalty;

> iii.     Emotional regulation and his poor coping methods such as self-harm and use of aggression;

> iv.     Poor parental supervision and guidance on part of the Accused’s mother in the past; and

> v.     Accused’s need to attend to the family’s financial responsibilities.

56     In my view, this comprehensive programme to tackle the Accused’s risk factors, over a longer period will clearly have a stronger and more lasting effect than a 6-month reformative training programme as it will keep the Accused on his toes for a longer period of time. As the deterrent effect of a 6-month reformative training sentence had already been taken care of by the 7-month remand, it is clearly a better option for the Accused to undergo a more comprehensive and longer lasting rehabilitative programme within the community. This will augur well for a more successful reintegration into society and I see no reason to delay that by incarcerating the Accused for a further 6-month period.

57     Furthermore, I found that probation programme not only addresses the Accused personally but also includes work with his family, which will clearly be more comprehensive and holistic in comparison with what will be covered by reformative training which will only be directed at the Accused.

58     A 6-month detention under reformative training would no doubt serve to have a salutary effect on the Accused. However, given that the Accused had already served a total of more than 7 months in remand prison, he would have already served longer than the recommended 6 –month reformative training period. The deterrent effect would have already been inflicted on him. To order him to go through another 6 months’ period of detention would be to doubly punish him.

59     I had accordingly sentenced the Accused to probation for 21 months with the following conditions:

> a)     Time Restriction for the Accused to remain at home from 10pm to 6am subject to his National Service obligations;

> b)     To perform 100 hours of community service;

> c)     Progress Accountability Court review in 4 months for the Accused to provide a personal account of his progress under probation; and

> d)     Mother to be bonded for $5000 to ensure the good behaviour of the Accused.

60     The order of probation had been held in abeyance pending the hearing of the appeal.
