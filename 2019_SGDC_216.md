Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Road Traffic Act - Driving whilst under a Court’s disqualification order – Young offenders

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9203/2019/01.\]

14 October 2019

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This case was about a young offender who had committed several traffic offences.

2       On 21 August 2019, the accused, a 19-year-old Singaporean male, pleaded guilty before me to three proceeded charges. They are for driving whilst under a court’s disqualification (“DQ”) order under s43(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) (“driving whilst under a court’s DQ order charge”), taking and riding motorcycle no. FBF7385M (“the motorcycle”) without the owner’s consent under s96(1) of the RTA (“driving without owner’s consent charge”) and riding the motorcycle without a policy of insurance being in force under s3(1) Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks & Compensation) Act (Cap 189( (“MV(3PR&C)A”) (“insurance charge”). 3 other charges were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentence. His elder sister, who was above the age of 21 years old, was present when he took the plea.

3       On 22 August 2019, I imposed a community sentence comprising of a short detention order of five days on the accused in respect of the three proceeded charges which he had pleaded guilty to. Additionally, he was disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“DQAC”) for a period of twenty-four (24) months with effect from date of release for the driving whilst under a court’s DQ order charge and DQAC for a period of twenty-four (24) months with effect from 21 August 2019 (date of conviction) for the insurance charge. His maternal uncle was present when he was sentenced.

4       On 26 August 2019, the Prosecution filed a Notice of Appeal against my decision on the sentence imposed on him. The accused has since completed serving his community sentence and was released from prison to commence serving his national service with the army immediately. He was originally supposed to commence serving his national service earlier but could not because he was remanded in custody over the charges he was facing.

5       Pending the appeal, the Prosecution did not apply for a stay of execution in relation to the disqualification orders imposed on the accused for both the driving whilst under a court’s DQ order and insurance charges.

7       On condition that the accused pleads guilty, the Prosecution agreed to proceed on the 1st to the 3rd charges and take into consideration (TIC) the 4th to the 6th charges for the purpose of sentence.

### Statement of Facts

8       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offences of the three proceed charges reads as follows:

> …

> 4.    On 23th July 2019 at about 5.12 p.m., complainant, while patrolling along Woodlands Avenue 7 junction of Woodlands Square, spotted the defendant riding motorcycle, FBF 7385 M, travelling along Woodlands Avenue 7 towards Woodlands Square. At the signalized T-junction of Woodlands Avenue 7 and Woodlands Square, complainant spotted the defendant mounted the footway on his left and rode along the footway of a public road and parked his motorcycle along the footway. The defendant was also spotted to be wearing helmet fitted with visor of not approved type. Complainant stopped the defendant along the footway. Complainant ascertained the identity of the rider to be that of defendant. Complainant tested the defendant’s visor with tint meter: 76 and result shown 12%. Upon checking, complainant discovered that the driving licence of the defendant was disqualified.

> 5.    Investigation also revealed that the entrusted owner of the motorcycle who is the victim, did not entrust the motorcycle onto the defendant. The defendant admitted to complainant that he had taken the motorcycle’s keys without the victim’s consent. The defendant claimed that on 22/07/2019 at about 9.00p.m., he was together with the victim at the victim’s bedroom to hang out and play video games. At about 10.00p.m. to 11.00p.m. of the same day, the defendant claimed that the victim fell asleep. The defendant saw the victim’s motorcycle key on the victim’s beside table and took the said key without the victim’s consent and rode the motorcycle back to his home. The defendant informed that he had taken the keys to start his job as a Deliveroo deliveryman. On 23/07/2019 at about 5.15p.m., the defendant rode the victim’s motorcycle heading towards Causeway Point when he was stopped by the complainant along the footway along Woodlands Avenue 7 junction of Woodlands Square.

> 6.    Complainant arrested the defendant for taking away vehicle without owner’s consent and driving whilst under disqualification. A report was lodged accordingly against him.

> 7.    Investigation revealed that on 30th January 2019, reference to Case ID, TP000576-2018, defendant was convicted for Using vehicle without insurance coverage under Sec 3(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act Chapter 189 and disqualified by the Subordinate Courts from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of vehicles for a period of 12 months with effect from 30th January 2019 till 29th January 2020.

> 8    As the driving licence of the defendant had been disqualified by Court, there was no insurance policy or such a security in respect of Third-Party Risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act, Chapter 189.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

10     In view of the accused’s age, the Prosecution submitted that they had no objections for the calling of a probation suitability report in order to assess the suitability of the accused to undergo probation.

11     I informed the Prosecution that I have no issues with calling for the probation suitability report. I had, in the past, ordered for a probation in respect of minor accused persons who had committed a similar offence of driving whilst under a court’s DQ.

12     However, in this case, I raised my concern that this accused continued to be remanded in custody because nobody was willing to stand bail for him. In fact, he had been remanded for 8 days when he pleaded guilty before this court.

13     In addition, I was informed that the accused was supposed to have reported for national service to undergo his basic military training (“BMT”) on 13 August 2019. However, because he was remanded in custody, he was unable to do so.

14     The bail conditions imposed on the accused when the matter was first mentioned before me were as follows:

> (a)     Bail sum of $15,000 to be furnished by non-monetary security;

> (b)     The sureties to be Singaporean;

> (c)     The accused's guardian must be a surety. At least one surety must be a guardian or parent;

> (d)     The accused must surrender any travel document in possession;

> (e)     The accused must surrender to custody, be available for investigations, or attend court, on the day and at the time and place appointed for the accused to do so, as the case may be;

> (f)     The accused must not commit any offence while released on bail or on personal bond;

> (g)     The accused must not interfere with any witness or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, whether in relation to the accused or in relation to any other person;

> (h)     The accused must abide by a curfew between 10pm and 6am unless when he is in camp whilst serving national service; and

> (i)     The accused must report to the investigation officer as and when required to do so.

15     His elder sister and his original agency bailor, the accused’s friend who is 23 years old, were both unwilling to stand as his bailors. They said they were afraid they were unable to ensure that the accused would comply with the curfew timing of 10pm to 6am daily when he is not serving national service. This was especially since neither of them lives with the accused.

16     Another concern I raised was that the accused was already late in reporting for national service. If nobody was willing to stand bail for him, he would be remanded in custody for at least three to four weeks before the probation suitability report is ready. This would mean that potentially, the accused might be remanded for a duration that is longer than the custodial sentence that is typically meted out on an accused for driving whilst under a court’s DQ as a first offender. If that were to happen, it would be unfair to the accused.

17     The Prosecution requested if I could offer the accused a personal bond so that he could be released pending the preparation of the probation suitability report. I enquired as to how was a minor able to execute a personal bond to guarantee his own attendance in court. Moreover, the guardian or a parent will need to consent to the accused being put on probation should the accused be found suitable for probation subsequently. Lastly, a court usually requires a parent or guardian to execute a personal bond to ensure the accused’s compliance with the conditions of the probation order and his good behaviour.

18     The Prosecution was unable to address my concerns adequately. Therefore, I requested the Prosecution to contact the accused’s parents to persuade them to attend court so that I could speak to them. I was even willing to consider a reduction in the bail amount to facilitate the rehabilitation process of the accused should his parents have any financial difficulties. This was because I understand that the accused comes from an underprivileged family environment.

19     I therefore adjourned the case for a day with bail offered to stand.

20     The following day, neither of the accused’s parents turned up in court. In fact, it was after much persuasion from the Investigating Officer (IO) that the accused’s maternal uncle and aunt agreed to attend court.

21     I asked the accused’s uncle if he was able to persuade the accused’s mother or father to attend court. The accused’s uncle said he spoke on behalf of the family. He added that the family no longer speaks to the accused’s father. The accused’s father is effectively out of his life. The accused’s grandmother who lives with him is old and frail and therefore cannot manage him.

22     The accused’s mother was unable to attend court because she is of poor health. She also does not live with the accused. In fact, the accused’s uncle made it very clear that the family would not allow the accused’s mother to bear any responsibility for the accused’s action, including standing as a bailor for her son or execute any bail bond for the accused even if it was in the accused’s best interest to rehabilitate him.

23     Following from there, the accused’s uncle informed me that the family is not agreeable to the calling of a probation suitability report. Even if probation is eventually recommended, none of the family members will be consenting for the accused to be placed on probation.

24     Instead, he hoped that the court would give the accused a fair sentence for his actions. This would allow him to serve his sentence and he could commence serving his national service as soon as possible to toughen him up. He commented that the family was sad that the accused has been irresponsible and got himself into trouble with the law. They were agreeable to support, encourage and guide him if he decides to turn over a new leaf after his release from prison. Nonetheless, they would want him to bear the responsibility of his own actions.

25     In essence, the accused’s maternal uncle informed me that none of the family members would agree to stand bail for the accused. Furthermore, even if probation is ultimately ordered, nobody in the accused’s family would consent to him being placed on probation or agree to provide a personal bond to ensure the accused’s compliance of the conditions imposed or his good behaviour during probation.

26     Despite the stance taken by the accused’s family, Prosecution submitted that they still wish for the court to call for a probation suitability report but left the ultimate decision on this and sentence to the court.

### Mitigation

27     The accused himself did not have any objections to the calling of a probation suitability report. In fact, I sensed that he was rather upset that none of his family members agreed to stand bail for him. He informed me that his grandmother is too old and immobile to come to court to help him.

28     In mitigation, the accused pleaded for leniency and he was remorseful for his wrongdoings. He said he had driven the motorcycle because he had wanted to earn more money as a deliveryman to support himself before serving national service.

### Reasons for Sentence

#### Raison d'être of a probation order

29     I first had to determine whether a probation suitability report should have been called for as submitted by the Prosecution since the accused was a minor at the time of the offences and at conviction.

30     Section 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the POA”) reads as follows:

> **Probation**

> **5.—(1**)    Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the opinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision of a probation officer or a volunteer probation officer for a period to be specified in the order of not less than 6 months nor more than 3 years:

>> Provided that where a person is convicted of an offence for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law, the court may make a probation order if the person —

>>> (_a_)    has attained the age of 16 years but has not attained the age of 21 years at the time of his conviction; and

>>> (_b_)    has not been previously convicted of such offence referred to in this proviso, and for this purpose section 11(1) shall not apply to any such previous conviction.

31     As mentioned earlier, I was in general agreement with the Prosecution that the starting presumption is that rehabilitation is the dominant sentencing objective for young offenders like the accused. Age of the offender is a critical factor when determining if a probation should be ordered in lieu of an imprisonment sentence: See _A Kartik v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“_Karthik”_) at \[33\].

32     In fact, it was highlighted by Sundaresh Menon CJ at \[20\] and \[21\] of _Kartik_ that a court should generally call for a probation pre-sentencing report before sentencing an offender who is 21 years of age or below. This is so unless the court is of the view that the basic prerequisites for probation to be considered are not met, or if the court is clearly satisfied that probation is not a realistic option on the facts of the case (citing _Wong Shan Shan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 49</span> at \[20\]):

> \[20\]  When a court deals with the sentencing of a young or youthful offender, that is to say, an offender who is aged 21 or below, it should generally call for a probation pre-sentencing report before imposing the sentence, and should not embark on an assessment of the offender’s suitability for probation without the benefit of such a report (_Wong Shan Shan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 49</span> (“_Wong Shan Shan_”) at \[19\] and \[21\]). The probation officer undertakes a detailed assessment of the offender’s circumstances before making a recommendation as to whether or not probation is appropriate. While the court is not bound by such a recommendation, it should not lightly exclude such detailed assessment as is generally contained in a probation pre-sentencing report (see further \[78\]–\[79\] below).

> 21    A court may, in general, sentence a youthful offender _without_ obtaining a probation pre-sentencing report if the basic prerequisites for probation to be considered are not met, or if the court is clearly satisfied that “probation is not a realistic option on the facts of the case” (_Wong Shan Shan_ at \[20\]).

33     It was also stated by Yong Pung How CJ in _PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR 138</span> at \[22\]:

> The judicial practice has been to require a probation report before sentencing a young offender. As per Ambrose J in _Tan Kah Eng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1965\] 2 MLJ 272</span>:

>> It is desirable that, as far as possible, the first offender under the age of 21 years should be kept out of prison, unless the offence is so serious that a sentence of imprisonment has to be imposed.

34     In the present case, in view of the accused’s age at the time of the offence and conviction as well as the nature of offences committed by him, I would agree with the Prosecution that, as a starting point, the basic prerequisites for probation to be considered are met. At the same time, given that the accused have committed primarily traffic offences and a minor CBT offence where the amount involved was small, I too am of the belief that it would be more desirable to keep the accused out of prison as far as possible.

35     However, I was clearly satisfied that probation in this case is not a realistic option on the facts of the present case for me to call for a probation suitability report on the accused. I will explain my reasons below.

#### The usual benchmark sentences for the offences committed by the accused

36     For all the charges faced by the accused, save for the driving whilst under a court’s DQ order charge, the sentences ordinarily imposed on an accused are fines. This included the CBT charge that was TIC, where the sum involved was small at $209.43. Even where this accused is traced for the insurance charge, an imprisonment sentence was unlikely to be meted out on him as a second offender. In all likelihood, he would have been given the maximum or close to the maximum fine of $1,000 and a DQ period that is longer than the last sentence.

37     In respect of the charge for driving whilst under a court’s DQ order, like the insurance charge, it is a strict liability offence. In _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) 581, it was held by Yong Pung How CJ (at para \[19\]):

> In my opinion, there were several factors, which strongly suggested that Parliament intended liability to be strict. Firstly, is the absence of any statutory defences for s 43(4) of the Act. Secondly, as is the case for the majority of strict liability offences, the offence of driving under disqualification is not a truly “criminal” offence but one that is regulatory in nature. Thirdly, s 43(4) is clearly concerned with the protection and safety of the public as it prohibits persons without valid or subsisting licences from driving on our public roads and highways and endangering human lives. Further, the reality of the situation is often that a person who drives while disqualified will also not be in possession of a valid third-party insurance policy as required by s 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act. Consequently, it was clear to me that the protection of public interest and the need to avoid the tremendous damage and injustice that can arise when members of the public are injured by such irresponsible drivers, mandates the reading of s 43(4) as a strict liability offence. Fourthly, I found it significant that active promotion of the observance of s 43(4) is very much dependent upon personal compliance by the individual since the traffic police are often unable, save in cases where the offender has been stopped for some other offences or on the off-chance when random checks are being conducted, to identify and stop disqualified persons from driving on the roads. Applying the reasoning of this court in _MV Balakrishnan_ (\[9\] _supra_) when construing s 35 of the Traffic Offences Act – a similar offence that deals with driving a class of motor vehicle without the requisite driving licence – the prohibited act is not one which the public can easily protect by its own vigilance. Conversely, it is no great hardship for a person who intends to drive to determine whether or not he is in fact qualified (or disqualified) to do so.

38     In the circumstances, Yong Pung How CJ held (at para \[43\]) that a motorist who chose to drive whilst under a court’s DQ order must expect a term of imprisonment and not merely a fine. This was because the motorist chose to drive in blatant disregard of the law and the authority of the courts. He can and should expect to face the full impact of the law upon him and receive enhanced custodial sentence.

39     As for the usual benchmark sentence for the driving whilst under a court’s DQ order offence, the Prosecution agreed that the starting point for a first time offender like the accused in the present case would have been 4 weeks’ imprisonment with a DQ period of at least double the last sentence where he was given the said DQ order. This would have been so if he were not a young offender.

40     In a nutshell, the driving whilst under a court’s DQ order was the most serious offence the accused was facing, as this would ordinarily attract a custodial sentence of at least 4 weeks’ imprisonment if he had been an adult offender.

#### The lack of co-operation from the accused’s family and a bailor to stand bail for the accused

41     As reiterated earlier, despite adjourning the case more than once, neither his parents attended court. None of his family members above the age of 21 was willing to stand bail for him. This was despite the fact that I was even prepared to reduce the bail amount as a means to assist the accused’s family. The original agency bailor, the accused’s 23-year-old friend, similarly refused to continue being his bailor. In any event, he did not qualify to be the accused’s guardian.

42     At the adjourned hearing before I sentenced the accused, as mentioned earlier, his maternal uncle made it evidently clear that the family would not be:

> (a)     standing bail for the accused even if the bail sum was reduced;

> (b)     consenting to any recommendation for the accused to be put on probation even if he was subsequently found to be suitable for it; or

> (c)     agreeing to provide any bail bond to ensure the accused’s compliance with the conditions imposed or his good behaviour during probation.

43     This was despite the fact that I had explained to the accused’s uncle the benefits of probation and standing bail for the accused so that I could call for a probation suitability report and the accused can serve his national service rather than languishing in remand in the meantime. Benefits of probation would include guidance and supervision by a probation officer.

44     I can only surmise that the accused’s family was unwilling or reluctant to bear the liability or burden of being responsible for the accused’s action should he fail to comply with the conditions for probation even if this was eventually found suitable and ordered by the court.

45     Next, even if I were to make a request for the completion of the probation suitability report to be on an expedited basis, this would still take some time. At that time, the accused had already been remanded for 8 days. On top of that, he was already late in reporting for national service.

46     Given the circumstances, it was highly likely that the accused would be remanded for a period that is of the same duration as or longer than the sentence he would have received for driving whilst under a court’s DQ order (i.e. same as or longer than the usual benchmark sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment) if we were to await the probation suitability report. In my view, this would have been inequitable to the accused.

47     Prosecution’s suggestion that the accused should execute a personal bond for his own good behaviour whilst waiting for the probation suitability report to avoid being remanded in custody was not tenable. Besides being a minor, he had neither assets nor funds to his name to put up as security to secure the personal bond. It cannot merely be a process of signing a piece of paper.

48     Pertinently, even if the accused was later found to be suitable for probation, I would still have difficulty obtaining the agreement of either of the accused’s parents or even a family member to execute the bail bond for his compliance with the conditions and good behaviour during the probation period. In that event, I would have great difficulty in giving the order.

49     Having mulled over and considered the accused’s circumstances and the nature of the offences he had committed (i.e. where the offences are not so serious that a sentence of imprisonment has to be imposed) carefully, I was clearly satisfied that this was unfortunately a case where probation for the accused was not a viable or realistic option.

#### Rationale for imposing a Short Detention Order

50     As I was of the view that rehabilitation is still a key factor when dealing with young offenders like the accused so as to assist them to have a swift reintegration back to the society, I then considered whether a community-based sentence like a short detention order (SDO) should be imposed on the accused instead. This is particularly given the fact that he had committed primarily traffic related offences. Driving whilst under a court’s DQ order and without insurance are further strict liability offences to protect public safety.

51     A short detention order or SDO is defined in the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) (Cap 68) as follows:

> **Short detention order**

> **348.— (1**)    Where an offender who is 16 years of age or above is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may make a short detention order requiring him to be detained in prison for a period which shall not exceed 14 days.

> (2)    Sections 317 and 318 shall apply to a short detention order as if the order were a sentence of imprisonment passed by the court.

52     The key point to note is that whilst a SDO is a community-based sentence, the offender is still required to be detained in prison for a period which does not exceed 14 days. A SDO therefore carries with it a deterrent element with the “clanging of prison doors”. Concurrently, it enables offenders of less serious crimes be dealt with in ways other than the traditional imprisonment sentence by enhancing the chances of rehabilitation for them. At the As held by the High Court in _Sim Wen Yi Earnest_ at \[41\]:

> …It is also in line with the broad policy objective that undergirds the CBS framework, that is, to enable offenders of less serious crimes to be dealt with in ways other than by imposing fines or imprisonment to enhance their chances of rehabilitation without diluting the deterrent objective of our penal regime or jeopardising the public’s sense of safety (_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts Volume 1_ (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“_Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts”_) at p77).

53     The SDOs acts as a warning for the offender of a more severe experience of imprisonment if he were to reoffend. Thus, the main rationale of a SDO is primarily for the purpose of rehabilitation rather than to obviate prison term. Given the age and profile of the accused in the present case as a young offender, imposing a SDO would certainly not lack rehabilitative value.

54     Moreover, a suitable period of disqualification from holding or obtaining a licence for any classes of vehicles can be imposed together with the SDO to deter the accused from driving. Thus, imposing the SDO in this particular case would not dilute the “deterrent objective of our penal regime or jeopardise the public’s sense of safety” in respect of the strict liability offences for driving whilst under a court’s DQ order or without insurance. Simultaneously, this would enable the accused to rebuild his life by integrating back to society without the stigma of having a criminal record as compared to if he were to serve an imprisonment sentence.

55     Last but not least, since the accused was already slated to serve his national service, a supervised and regulated environment may be more beneficial to him than remanding him in prison until the probation suitability report is ready. He would, like other young Singaporean men his age, have to go through a military routine and undergo at least 3 months of BMT under the watchful eye of his superiors. It is hoped that the regimental life of the army would aid to reform him as a responsible citizen and instil discipline in his life.

56     All things considered, I duly imposed a community sentence comprising of a short detention order in that the accused is to be detained in prison for a period of five (5) days in respect of all his proceeded charges. Additionally, I impose a 24 months’ disqualification period from holding or obtaining driving licences for all classes with effect from the date of release and conviction respectively for his driving whilst under the a court’s DQ order and without insurance respectively. In coming to the duration of the SDO, I took into account of the fact that the accused had already been remanded for 8 days in prison prior to his conviction.

57     Finally, I requested Prisons to send the accused to his military unit to report for national service upon his release from prison after serving his SDO. Fundamentally, the sentence, in my view, was done in the best interest of the accused given the circumstances with the primary objective of rehabilitating, reforming and reintegrating him back to society as soon as possible with the offences he had committed in mind.
