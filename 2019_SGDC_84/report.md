Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Road Traffic Offences

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 5/2019/01.\]

6 May 2019

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused is a 37-year-old Singaporean male whom I understand was formerly self-employed. Between September 2016 to September 2018, the accused accumulated a whopping number of traffic offence notices and summonses totalling 146. They included 143 Land Transport Authority (LTA) notices and 3 Traffic Police (TP) summonses involving 25 motorcars registered under his name.

2       Besides that, he had numerous pending cases with the Housing Development Board (HDB) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). Just recently, he was charged with drug related offences and using criminal force against a public servant.

3       On 10 April 2019, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the three proceeded TP charges and 48 LTA charges offered by the Prosecution. He was thereafter sentenced accordingly as follows:

4       The accused, being dissatisfied, is appealing against the sentence imposed on him. He was unable to pay the fine amount imposed, whether in full or in part. He is presently serving the default sentence.

## BACKGROUND FACTS

### The Charges

5       A summary of the 146 TP and LTA offences committed by the accused is as follows:

6       For the 3 TP summonses, there were also 3 counts of show cause for the accused’s failure to appear in court for them during the first court mention. There was no plea offer given to the accused.

7       In respect of the 143 LTA notices, on condition of plea, the Prosecution agreed to proceed on 48 charges (i.e. C96 to 143 in LTA’s Schedule of Offences) and, subject to the consent of the accused, allow the remaining 95 be taken into consideration (TIC) for the purpose of sentence. Additionally, there were 138 counts of show cause again for the accused’s failure to appear in court for them during the first court mention.

8       When the accused appeared before me on 10 April 2019, this was pursuant to a Warrant to Arrest (WTA) that was already executed against him for his failure to appear in court to answer to these 146 charges.

9       Besides that, the accused was charged in another court (Court 26) earlier on the same day for drug offences as well as an offence for using criminal force against a public servant. He was offered bail in the sum of $15,000 in 1 surety or 2 sureties.

10     Thereafter, he was brought to Court 14 to answer to his pending cases with the HDB and URA. In view of the numerous number of charges he was facing there, a further sum of $77,000 with 1 surety was offered to him as bail. A bail review was fixed on 11 April 2019 by Court 14 to confirm if he was able to raise the bail amount.

11     When the accused was finally brought before me that afternoon to answer to his long outstanding TP and LTA charges, he had originally asked for bail to be offered to him. This was because he informed me that he had pending personal matters to settle and would not be able to be remanded in prison for too long a period as he is a single parent. Furthermore, he said that the offences were committed because the motorcars were used as part of his business which has since failed. He would therefore need more time to resolve the matters with TP and LTA.

12     As the accused had a history of jumping bail on 2 previous earlier court mentions (i.e. this was the third WTA issued against him for both the TP and LTA offences) and given the fact that he was facing a long string of offences in 3 courts, I had no alternative but to offer him bail in the sum of $70,000 in 1 surety or 2 sureties for the 146 TP and LTA charges. Additionally, this would have to be cash bail as he would already have been given a non-monetary bail of $15,000 earlier for his drug and using criminal force against a public servant offences.

13     Moreover, his LTA offences were long outstanding as early as 2 November 2017 (first mention). His TP offences were outstanding as early as 26 February 2018 (first mention). Significant time was therefore already given to him to either compound or make representations to appeal on the summonses or notices. It is imperative to point out that his previous non-monetary bail sum of $2,000 per charge in 1 surety (i.e. $292,000 for 146 charges) for his TP and LTA charges did not deter him from jumping bail again.

14     Finally, as the accused was unrepresented, I further explained to him that if he was unable to raise bail and consequently remanded and if he subsequently chose to plead guilty to the charges but was unable to pay the fines, I would not be able to backdate the default sentence imposed to the first date of his remand.

15     The accused requested me to give him some time to consider the matter and speak to his potential bailor, whom I understand is his wife or partner. I agreed and stood down the case. When the case was finally re-mentioned, the accused informed me that he was unable to raise bail given his numerous offences and therefore wished to plead guilty to all the proceeded charges. In the circumstances, I agreed to take his plea.

### Statement of Facts

16     The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) for the 3 TP summonses dated 9 April 2019 without qualification. A concise, succinct and edited version of the SOF depicting the offence for failing to furnish driver’s particulars within 14 days of a traffic offence is as follows:

19     The accused had other dissimilar compounded traffic offences.

### Prosecution’s Address on Sentence

20     The Prosecution for both TP and LTA orally submitted that the usual tariff should apply for all charges and left the quantum of fine to the court.

### Mitigation

21     The accused orally submitted that his business has failed and he was attempting to support his child as a single parent and make ends meet. He was facing financial difficulties and required more time to resolve all his existing liabilities which he had accumulated over the past two years. They included the summonses and notices for the 25 motorcars owned by him as part of his business. As he was unable to furnish bail, he pleaded for leniency and a light sentence as he would similarly need to plead guilty to his HDB and URA offences in Court 14.

22     As for the show cause for failing to appear in court to answer to the 141 TP and LTA summonses and notices, the accused explained that he had moved house and no longer stayed at the address stated on his Identity Card (IC). In any event, he was unable to change the address on his IC because he had lost the physical card. As such, he did not receive any summonses or notices sent to him informing him to attend court.

### Reasons for Sentence

#### Principal Offences

23     As the accused present matter for the charges were first commenced in the night court, both TP and LTA would have given the accused time to compound the matter. However, the accused failed to do so. Furthermore, even if an offender fails to compound the matter timeously, he can still avoid attending court by paying a higher fine amount using the AXS online, app or kiosk services via the PG@ATOMS prior to the first court mention date.

24     The composition fine rates for the common TP and LTA offences can be found on their websites. Typically, the composition fine amounts for common offences like parking and ERP ranges from $70 to $130 for motorcars if the offender agrees to compound the matter at an early stage. The higher fine amounts payable via PG@ATOMS prior to the first court mention date typically ranges from $200 to $300.

25     When an offender, like the accused, fails to compound the road traffic offence by the first court mention date, he may no longer be allowed to compound the matter thereafter. In the circumstances, should the offender wish to plead guilty in court and pay the court fine, the fine amount imposed by the courts will most certainly be higher than the composition or PG@ATOMS fine amounts. The offender cannot expect to be given a discount given that he has chosen to delay matters.

26     Recently reported cases have shown that the usual tariff that is applicable to first offenders in respect of common road traffic offences like ERP, parking and failing to furnish driver’s particulars offences is $400 to $500 if they choose to plead guilty in court:

(a)      _PP v Nunoeng Roheryanto Bin Wahid_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 245</span>, where $400 in default 1 day’s imprisonment was imposed on each charge_;_ and

(b)      _PP v Fok Jun Hong Johnson_ \[2017\], where $500 in default 1 day’s imprisonment was imposed on each charge.

27     In respect of the offences faced by the accused, they all attract a maximum fine of $1,000 for a first offender. The corresponding punishment provision for the relevant offences are as follows:

28     For the reasons stated above, I was of the view that the fine of $400 in default 1 day’s imprisonment imposed on the accused cannot be said to be manifestly excessive since it clearly fell within the lower range of the usual tariff for a court fine. The default sentence was also the minimum sentence imposed. In fact, I was of the view that I was rather lenient towards the accused given that this was the third WTA issued and executed against him for failing to appear in court. He even had a relevant court conviction for parking under Rule 28 of the RTR.

29     The accused might have felt aggrieved that the collective fines imposed for all his TP and LTA charges was $27,450, in default 192 days' imprisonment. Unfortunately, he only had himself to blame as he chose to accumulate all the road traffic offences for the past 2 years without dealing with them expeditiously. Over and above that, he had failed to appear in court for the first mentions in respect of 141 notices or summonses. Finally, he had jumped bail twice by failing to turn up in court for subsequent mentions. That resulted in bail offered to him being increased substantially. All these created a snowballing effect and his liabilities finally caught up with him.

#### Show Cause

30     As for the 141 counts of show cause, as highlighted earlier, the accused had failed to appear in court for the first mention of each notice or summons. In the circumstances, warrant to arrest was issued against him and pursuant to s133(5) and s133(6), the accused would have to explain in court the reasons for his failure to attend court.

31     Section 133(5) and (6) of the RTA state:

133 - (5)    If a person, upon whom such a notice has been served as aforesaid, fails to appear before a court in person or by counsel in accordance therewith, the court may, if satisfied that the notice was duly served, issue a warrant for the arrest of the person unless in the case of an offence which may be compounded that person has before that date been permitted to compound the offence.

(6)    Upon a person arrested in pursuance of a warrant issued under subsection (5) being produced before it, a court shall —

(a)    proceed as though he were produced before it under section 153 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010; and

(b)    at the conclusion of the proceedings, call upon him to show cause why he should not be punished for failing to attend in compliance with the notice served upon him, and if cause is not shown may order him to pay such fine not exceeding $2,000 as the court thinks fit or may commit him to prison for a term not exceeding 2 months.

32     As mentioned by the accused in mitigation, his failure to notify his change of address due to the fact that he had lost his IC was not a justifiable or reasonable excuse for his failure to attend court. In the circumstances, I was of the view that cause was not shown.

33     As regards the fine amount for show cause, recently reported cases have shown that the usual tariff for such night court cases is typically $100 in default 1 day’s imprisonment per count of show cause:

(a)      _PP v Nunoeng Roheryanto Bin Wahid_, where $100 in default 1 day’s imprisonment was imposed for each count of show cause_;_ and

(b)      _PP v Fok Jun Hong Johnson_ \[2017\], where $100 in default 1 day’s imprisonment was imposed for each count of show cause.

34     Having considered that the accused had accumulated a not insignificant number of show cause at 141 and his poor financial situation, I decided to impose a very minimal sum of $50 in default 1 day’s imprisonment on him for each count of show cause. This amounted to a total of $7,050 in default 141 days’ imprisonment. Given the large number of show cause, the fine imposed could not be said to be manifestly excessive. In fact, I could say that this was clearly below the usual tariff but considered holistically in order to aid the accused in view of his financial plight raised by him in mitigation.

## CONCLUSION

35     In summary, in the late afternoon of 10 April 2019, the accused pleaded guilty before me to the three proceeded TP charges and 48 LTA charges. He was thereafter sentenced accordingly as follows:

36     On 12April 2019, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal against the sentence imposed on him. He is serving default sentence pending the appeal.

37     Recently, the Traffic Police has announced an increase in the composition fine amounts with effect from 1 April 2019 in a bid to curb the uptrend in road traffic offences (_High fines for motorists, pedestrians and cyclists from April: MHA_, CNA 21 February 2019). With the revision, the composition fines for common road traffic offences will now range from $100 to $150.

38     Consequently, motorists are gently reminded that if they choose to delay matters and subsequently decide to only plead guilty to their road traffic offences in court, they must expect an even higher court fine than the current tariff being meted out on them.
