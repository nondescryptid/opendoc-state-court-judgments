Tort – Negligence – Contributory Negligence

Tort – Negligence – Vicarious Liability

Road Traffic – Third Party Liability

20 November 2020

### District Judge James Leong Kui Yiu:

## Introduction

1       The case before me involved a tragic accident, where a fully laden motor vehicle YM8972C (“the truck”) had barrelled through a signalised pedestrian crossing, despite the lights having turned red. The accident injured two persons and killed one. The plaintiff in DC/DC 848/2014 (“Suit 848”), who was injured, seeks to claim damages as against the defendants in an action for negligence. In turn, the defendants seek an indemnity from their contracted vehicle maintenance mechanics, joining them as a third party to this action.

2       Subsequently, the family members of the deceased – specifically the father, mother, brother, and sister – commenced an action against the same defendants in DC/DC 3273/2015 (“Suit 3273”) pursuant to sections 20 and 21 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). By an order of court in Suit 3273 dated 29 January 2019, (DC/ORC 444/2019), it was ordered _inter alia_ that:

> (a)     the trial on liability for Suit 3273 and the third party action related to Suit 3273 be tried at the same time as the trial on liability for Suit 848 and the third party action related to Suit 848;

> (b)     the evidence admitted in the trial on liability for Suit 848 and the third party action related to Suit 848 shall also be admitted in the trial on liability for Suit 3273 and the third party action related to Suit 3273, and _vice versa_;

> (c)     the documents disclosed and affidavits filed in the trial on liability for Suit 848 and the third party action related to Suit 848 shall be treated as having been disclosed and filed in Suit 3273 and the third party action related to Suit 3273, and _vice versa_;

> (d)     the evidence admitted in the third party action related to Suit 848 shall also be admitted in the trial on liability for the main proceedings in Suit 848, and similarly, that the evidence admitted in the third party action related to Suit 3273 shall be also be admitted in the trial on liability for the main proceedings in Suit 3273.

3       The parties in Suit 3273 arrived at a settlement prior to the first day of the trial and informed the court that they had agreed on liability subject to the outcome of the third party proceedings.

4       The trial in relation to the plaintiff and the third party proceedings spanned seven days. Parties called a total of 12 lay and expert witnesses: two witnesses for the plaintiff, four witnesses for the defendants, and six witnesses for the third party.

5       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the defendants liable to the plaintiff for 92.5% of the damages to be assessed by the registrar, with the 2nd defendant being vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1st defendant. I also dismissed the claim of the defendants against the third party.

6       The defendants have since appealed against my decision in both actions to the High Court (HC/DCA 22/2020 and HC/DCA 23/2020). Elaborating on the brief oral reasons that I delivered on 3 July 2020, these are my grounds of decision.

## Background facts

### Parties

7       The plaintiff was one of the three victims of the accident. She was working as a pre-schoolteacher,[^1] and was on her way to the tuition centre where she was giving part-time tuition when the accident occurred.[^2]

8       The 1st defendant was employed as a driver at the material time by the 2nd defendant who were in the logistics business.

9       The 2nd defendant were the registered owners of the truck that was driven by the 1st defendant at the time of the accident.

10     The third party was in the business of providing maintenance and service packages for diesel trucks. They were the contracted vehicle maintenance mechanic of the 2nd defendant responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the 2nd defendant’s vehicles including the truck.

### Facts relating to the accident

11     On 4 November 2012, the truck was brought to the third party’s workshop because of a worn clutch. The third party carried out maintenance on the truck and returned it to the 2nd defendant on 5 November 2012. Between the time of return of the truck and the accident, the truck had travelled over 200km in the ordinary course of the 2nd defendant’s business.

12     The motor accident occurred on 6 November 2012 at or about 6.30pm.

13     The plaintiff was standing at a pedestrian crossing at the junction of Clementi Avenue 6 and Clementi Loop. When the light turned in her favour, the plaintiff began to cross the road. At the same time, the 1st defendant was driving the truck along Clementi Avenue 6 towards the junction, after exiting the Ayer Rajah Expressway (“AYE”).

14     When the 1st defendant approached the junction, the traffic light signal was red. The truck did not stop and proceeded to hit the three victims, as a consequence of which the plaintiff suffered injuries and the deceased victim was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident.

### Procedural history

15     The 1st defendant was convicted after trial on 25 January 2016 on:

> (a)     One charge of causing the death of a pedestrian at a traffic light pedestrian crossing by driving his motor lorry in a dangerous manner that is by driving at an unsafe speed and with inefficient brakes under the then s 66(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) for which he was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment and a seven year disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles;

> (b)     One charge of causing grievous hurt to another pedestrian at the same traffic light pedestrian crossing by driving rashly at an unsafe speed and with inefficient brakes such as to endanger human life by driving so rashly and at an unsafe speed and with inefficient brakes such as to endanger human life under s 338(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) for which he was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment;

> (c)     One charge of causing hurt to a third pedestrian at the said traffic light pedestrian crossing by driving rashly at an unsafe speed and with inefficient brakes such as to endanger human life under s 337(a) of the Penal Code for which he was sentenced to one month imprisonment.

16     The 1st defendant also pleaded guilty to a fourth unrelated charge of obtaining the sexual services of a minor for consideration under s 376B(1) of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment in relation to the fourth unrelated charge.

17     The sentences for the first and the fourth charges were ordered to run consecutively and the remaining sentences to run concurrently, making a total of seven months and 12 weeks imprisonment and a disqualification for a period of seven years for all classes of driving licenses.

18     The decision is set out in _PP v Sun Xin Jian_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 22</span> (“_Sun Xin Jian_”). The 1st defendant’s appeal in MA 153/2015/01 against this decision was dismissed by the High Court on 13 May 2016.

## The parties’ cases

19     The plaintiff’s case was that:

> (a)     the said collision was caused by the negligence of the 1st defendant for whose actions the 2nd defendant as employer are vicariously liable;

> (b)     the plaintiff was just about to begin crossing and was standing on the pedestrian island when the accident happened;

> (c)     the truck had mounted the pedestrian island, swerved into the pedestrian crossing and collided into the plaintiff; and

> (d)     the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.

20     The 1st and 2nd defendants’ case was as follows:

> (a)     the plaintiff had not proven on a balance of probabilities that the accident occurred as a result of negligence pleaded in the Statement of Claim;

> (b)     further or in the alternative, that the accident was an inevitable accident;

> (c)     further or in the alternative, that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, and should bear at least 20% of the liability for failing to keep a proper lookout by checking if the traffic on the left had stopped or was about to stop before starting to cross the junction; and

> (d)     that the third party should indemnify the defendants wholly or for the bulk of the liability which the court finds against the defendants (if any), for their failure to exercise reasonable care and ensure that the vehicle’s brakes were in a serviceable and roadworthy condition at all material times.

21     The third party’s position was that:

> (a)     when the truck was returned to the 2nd defendant on 5 November 2012, its brakes and braking system were in good serviceable and mechanical condition and it was in a good roadworthy condition;

> (b)     the accident was not caused or contributed by the third party’s servicing or maintenance of the truck’s brakes or braking system and that the accident occurred without their negligence or default, but rather the 1st defendant’s negligence in the driving, management, and control of the truck;

> (c)     further or in the alternative, the defendants, with full knowledge and understanding of the danger arising from driving the truck with ineffective brakes, voluntarily accepted the risk of injury; and

> (d)     the defendants had failed to take any proper or effective steps to avoid the accident and/or to avert and/or prevent the accident.

## Issues to be determined

22     Whilst parties had canvassed multiple issues to be determined, I found that the salient issues could be narrowed down to the following three:

> (a)     whether I should consider the criminal conviction of the 1st defendant in _Sun Xin Jian_ and if so, the weight to be accorded to it;

> (b)     whether the accident was substantially caused by the 1st defendant driving rashly; and

> (c)     whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff or third party.

**_Issue 1: Should the criminal conviction in_** **PP v Sun Xin Jian** **_be considered, and if so, what was the weight to be accorded to it?_**

23     As a preliminary point, the defendants asserted that the plaintiff did not plead the 1st defendant’s conviction in support of their case. It is however trite that one pleads facts, and not evidence. As the 1st defendant’s conviction was only a subordinate fact, it should not be canvassed in pleadings, per _Jusoh v Ng Ah Soi & Anor_ \[1963\] 1 MLJ 92. Further, the burden of disproving the conviction of the 1st defendant lies on the defendants, and the onus is not on the plaintiff to prove that the 1st defendant was convicted. (See Sweet & Maxwell, Singapore Civil Procedure Volume 1, (2020 Edition) at 18/7/10).

24     Section 45A (1) to (3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) states that:

> **Relevance of convictions and acquittals**

> **45A.**–– (1)    Without prejudice to sections 42, 43, 44 and 45, the fact that a person has been convicted or acquitted of an offence by or before any court in Singapore shall be admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where relevant to any issue in the proceedings, that he committed (or, as the case may be, did not commit) that offence, whether or not he is a party to the proceedings; and where he was convicted, whether he was so convicted upon a plea of guilty or otherwise.

> (2)    A conviction referred to in subsection (1) is relevant and admissible unless ––

>> (a)    it is subject to review or appeal that has not yet been determined;

>> (b)    it has been quashed or set aside; or

>> (c)    a pardon has been given in respect of it.

> (3)    A person proved to have been convicted of an offence under this section shall, unless the contrary is proved, be taken to have committed the acts and to have possessed the state of mind (if any) which at law constitutes that offence.

25     In _DBS Bank Ltd v Yamazaki Mazak Singapore Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 181</span> (“_Yamazaki_”) at \[19\] to \[25\], Tay Yong Kwang J (as he then was) noted that the evidence of a criminal conviction is admissible for any other subsequent proceedings under s 45A whether one pleads guilty or was convicted after trial.

26     The purpose behind s 45A was to save judicial time and legal costs by not having to re-litigate issues in civil proceedings where the same issues have already been previously decided by a court in criminal proceedings: per _Yamazaki_ at \[22\]:

> 22    The purpose behind s 45A is to save judicial time and legal costs by not having to re-litigate issues in civil proceedings where the same issues have been previously decided by a court in criminal proceedings (see _Ong Bee Nah_ at \[51\] where the relevant parliamentary debate is set out; see also _PP v Heah Lian Khin_ \[2000\] 3 SLR 609 at \[89\]). It also prevents, in the words of Goh Joon Seng J (“Goh J”), “a collateral attack by means of a civil action against a final decision of a court of competent criminal jurisdiction” (_Choo Michael_ at 600). Bearing in mind that the standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt in criminal proceedings is much higher than that of a balance of probabilities in civil proceedings, it only makes eminent sense to allow evidence of conviction to be admissible in subsequent civil proceedings, founded upon the same conduct of the convicted person. The difference in the standard of proof as well as the difference in the procedure in regard to the adducing of evidence in criminal and civil proceedings would mean that a finding of culpability against a person upon a contested criminal trial is of higher probative value than that in civil proceedings.

> …

27     However, this does not mean that the admissibility of evidence of a criminal conviction is conclusive in and of itself: per _Yamazaki_ at \[24\] and \[25\]:

> 24    It must be borne in mind that the admissibility of evidence of a criminal conviction is not conclusive in and of itself (_Choo Michael_ at 600; _Ong Bee Nah_ at \[42\]). Indeed, this is provided for in s 45A(3) of the EA. The Butterworths’ Annotated Statutes of Singapore (Jeffrey Pinsler gen ed) (Butterworths Asia, 1997 Issue) in vol 5, Evidence, at p 141 explains the sub-section as follows:

>> **Sub-s (3)** _Proof of the conviction is not conclusive, but is a presumption of law which may be rebutted by proof that there was no conviction_. If unrebutted, the person concerned is regarded, by law, as having had the mens rea (if required by the offence) for, and as having committed the actus reus of, the offence \[emphasis added\].

> 25    As for the weight to be given to evidence from criminal proceedings, a holistic approach should be adopted in assessing the precise weight which should be attached to such evidence (_Ong Bee Nah_ at \[62\]; this approach was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _PlanAssure PAC (formerly known as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 513</span> at \[111\]-\[112\]). However, there is no doubt that such evidence will, in the nature of things, “figure in the court’s mind in at least a minimally substantive way” (_Ong Bee Nah_ at \[62\]), though the court must always be prepared to “take into account evidence to the contrary that might prevail at the end of the day” (_id_).

28     Applying the above to the facts of our case, there was no credible evidence to refute the findings of the learned district judge in _Sun Xin Jian_. It was open to the defendants to show that notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiff’s action was founded upon the same criminal conduct in the earlier prosecution, the 1st defendant did not “commit the acts” and did not possess the “state of mind (if any)” which at law constituted the offence that he had been convicted of. Unfortunately for the defendants, the 1st defendant, whose affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) was admitted without cross examination, did not even attend at the trial to do this. The defendants also did not produce any new evidence which was not admitted in the earlier criminal proceedings. In light of the above, I was of the view that the conviction in _Sun Xin Jian_ was admissible and of material weight.

### Issue 2: Whether the accident was substantially caused by the 1st defendant driving rashly?

29     In his AEIC, the 1st defendant alleged that as he exited the slip road of the AYE to Clementi Avenue 6, he was driving upslope on the centre lane, and thereafter shifting to the first lane. When going downslope, he was about five to six lorry lengths from the pedestrian crossing when he saw the lights change to amber. He then applied the brakes but realised they were not working. He tried to stop the truck by changing down his gear, but he could not engage a lower gear.

30     He further claimed that he was driving at about 30-40km/h and using the 5th gear of the truck.

31     This was despite the criminal court already finding that the 1st defendant was not driving at a very slow speed. The court was certain that he was driving at or about 50km/h, considering the objective evidence presented during the criminal trial. This also contradicts the GPS records showing that the truck was travelling between 56-58km/h at that point in time,[^3] and that the 1st defendant was travelling well above 50km/h as he approached the junction, as highlighted at \[49\] of _Sun Xin Jian_.

32     As highlighted by the district judge in _Sun Xin Jian_ at \[58\], rashness can be defined as “a disregard to the possibility of injury or death”.

33     In the present case, the 1st defendant was driving a vehicle which was not his usual vehicle. He alleged to have observed that the brakes were not as effective as his usual vehicle, yet he travelled at close to the vehicle’s speed limit when approaching the traffic light. Consideration must also be given to the fact that the 1st defendant was not driving a light vehicle, but a 24-footer refrigerated truck weighing over 10 tons when laden,[^4] which had the potential to cause significant damage if not driven carefully.

34     Counsel for the defendants asserted in submissions that the 1st defendant stated in his AEIC that there was only a slight difference between the truck’s brakes and the brakes of the usual vehicle YM 431A which he normally drove, and that the truck’s brakes were working and he did not encounter any problems in slowing down or stopping the truck prior to the accident.[^5] I found that the 1stdefendant was not entirely truthful in stating the same in his AEIC.

35     Referring to his long statement given to the police, the same line was present,[^6] however, he qualified that the difference he felt was “that the brake on YM8972C is not as effective as my other lorry but the brakes are still working”. The 1st defendant went on further to add:

> I knew that I had to slow down more when I am driving YM8972C. It was my intention to use this lorry for the first delivery and later come back to the company to switch to another lorry “431”.

36     This was extracted from the long statement taken by the police on 7 November 2012 at 12.09am, hours after the accident. It is inexplicable why the 1st defendant would provide such a statement if he did not already observe that there was some degree of inefficiency in the braking system of the truck, relative to his usual vehicle. There would otherwise have been no reason for him to “have to slow down more” or “switch to another lorry". I further noted that the long statement was admitted into evidence in the criminal trial without any challenge to the voluntariness of the statement.[^7]

37     It was therefore clear that the 1st defendant, in driving in the manner that he did, especially after he had observed a degree of inefficiency in the braking system, had taken on a conscious and deliberate risk that an accident might in fact result.

38     As such, I found myself in agreement with the district judge in _Sun Xin Jia_n that the 1st defendant had acted rashly by driving at an unsafe speed, going through the red lights and colliding into the three victims because he was unable to stop the truck in time.

#### Defence of inevitable accident

39     In submissions, the defendants sought to rely on the defence of inevitable accident. It is axiomatic that to establish a defence of inevitable accident, one has to show that he could not, by exercising ordinary care, caution and skill have prevented the accident, as adopted by Judith Prakash J (as she then was) in _Loh Luan Choo Betsy (alias Loh Baby) (administratrix of the estate of Lim Him Long) and others v Foo Wah Jek_ \[2005\] 1 SLR (R) 64 at \[28\].

40     Prakash J noted that this was a factual inquiry, where the court has to consider the particulars of negligence relied upon by the plaintiff. One of the factors highlighted was the speed at which the vehicle was travelling. This had to be taken into consideration with the conditions at that time, and even if the driver was travelling within the speed limit, it does not automatically mean that the driver can never be considered to be driving at an excessive speed.

41     Bearing in mind the circumstances at the material time, I found that the 1st defendant who was in control of the vehicle should not have been driving at such a speed when he observed that the brakes were not as effective as his usual vehicle. He was also going upslope and had noticed many cars in the lane he originally was in, which necessitated him filtering to the right lane.[^8] I further noted that the GPS records showed that he was mostly travelling at speeds below 30km/h for a substantial part of the journey, and at only reached speeds of 56km/h to 58km/h in the last few minutes leading up to the accident. In the circumstances, the 1st defendant was clearly negligent, and the defence of inevitable accident must necessarily fail.

### Issue 3: Whether there was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff or third party?

#### Plaintiff

42     The defendants assert that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent, in failing to keep a lookout for oncoming vehicles whilst crossing the road, relying on the case of _Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 944</span> (“_Asnah_”).

43     The defence of contributory negligence modulates a victim’s right to recover damages from a tortfeasor by the extent to which he could himself have prevented the accident from happening. Based on the circumstances of the case, a person would be contributorily negligent, if he ought to have objectively foreseen that his failure to act prudently could result in hurting himself, and he did fail to take reasonable measures to guard against that foreseeable harm.

44     A finding of contributory negligence is not premised on a breach of some duty owed to the tortfeasor. What is required of the tortfeasor is to show that the claimant owes _himself_ a duty to take care of his own safety in the circumstances of the case. In the present case, the defendants alleged that the plaintiff failed to keep a proper lookout for the truck before she started crossing the road.

45     In coming to its decision in _Asnah_, the Court of Appeal had determined that the standard of care expected of pedestrians when using a signalised pedestrian crossing is prescribed under Rule 22 of the Highway Code, which reads:

> **Signalled Controlled Crossings**

> **22**.    At a light controlled crossing, wait on the footway until the traffic, in front of which you intend to cross, has come to a standstill.

46     This means that even when the lights are in the pedestrian’s favour, the pedestrian must wait for the traffic in front of them to have come to a stop before starting to cross the road. Considering the impracticalities of strict adherence to the rule, and balancing it against the risk of potential harm to the pedestrian, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the purpose behind Rule 22 would equally be achieved when pedestrians have assured themselves that approaching vehicles are slowing down towards the crossing, before they leave the footway for the crossing. In essence, the duty of the pedestrian was to satisfy himself that approaching vehicles have stopped or are stopping, and it could be easily discharged by taking a quick glance, before the pedestrian enters the crossing.

47     The majority in _Asnah_ held that the plaintiff did not check for oncoming vehicular traffic, or if he did, had clearly failed to make a reasonable assessment of the risks posed by the approaching vehicle as per \[114\] of _Asnah_ and apportioned his contribution at 15%.

##### (1)   Evidence presented at trial

48     I now turn to the facts of the present case. Apart from the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, the only other persons who were present at the scene of the accident called to provide their testimony were Mr Darius Sim, PW1, (“Mr Sim”), and Mr Abdul Samat Bin Jumaat, DW1, (“Mr Samat”).

49     It merits repeating that the 1st defendant did not appear at the trial to testify. The court was informed that the 1st defendant, after having served his sentence, was repatriated to China. The parties however agreed that his AEIC be admitted into evidence, with the issue of weight to be left to submissions.

50     Mr Sim was an independent witness who saw the entire incident, as he was standing at the opposite side of the road, crossing the road to where the plaintiff was standing.[^9] At that time, the weather was clear, and the road surface was dry. Mr Sim testified that he saw the three victims on the pedestrian island across him, and could see down the road as far as it crested over the river (or canal).[^10] Mr Sim also testified that the deceased victim was standing closest to the traffic light, followed by the plaintiff, and then the third victim.[^11]

51     After the traffic lights for the vehicles had turned red, pedestrian lights turned green in his favour, and the cars on his side of the road had come to a stop, Mr Sim and the pedestrians began to cross the road.[^12] Mr Sim also observed that amongst the pedestrians crossing the road from the opposite side, the plaintiff and the third victim were slightly ahead of the deceased victim. At this juncture, he had already taken about two steps into the crossing.[^13] This was when he heard some shouting coming from his right, and when he turned his attention to his right, he saw the truck travelling at speed towards the junction. There was a person on the passenger side of the truck shouting and waving out of the window, as if to wave people away. The front tyre of the truck had mounted the kerb at this juncture but did not appear to be able to come to a stop at the stop line.[^14]

52     Mr Sim also testified that he could not recall, but would assume that the plaintiff was run over by the left side tyre, closest to the passenger door, as the plaintiff was lying beside the truck on the side closest to him.[^15] On the whole, I found that Mr Sim’s evidence was internally and externally consistent, and I accorded substantial weight to his evidence.

53     Mr Samat was an employee of the 2nd defendant, and he was in the cab of the truck during the material time. Mr Samat was seated on the left side of the cab, with one Mr Saiful in the middle, and the 1st defendant in the driver’s seat.[^16] Mr Samat testified that they were doing the first delivery of the journey, and the truck was travelling smoothly just before the accident, and there was no issue with stopping at the various traffic lights and manoeuvring through the heavy traffic.[^17] In his AEIC, Mr Samat also described in detail the events leading up to the accident, which included him observing panic on the 1st defendant’s face, and seeing the 1st defendant stepping on the brakes and engaging the gears of the truck. Following the accident, Mr Samat alighted from the vehicle and saw both ladies lying on the floor near the left tyre.[^18]

54     Whilst I pause to note that Mr Sim had testified that he noticed someone waving out of the left window of the truck’s cab, and Mr Samat had testified that he did not wave nor do anything as he was in a state of panic, parties had not sought to challenge either witness’ testimony nor address this apparent gap. In any case, I was satisfied that this was not material to my decision.

55     I did not attach significant weight to the evidence of Mr Samat in relation to the alleged efforts of the 1st defendant to slow the vehicle down, which would support the defendants’ position. This was because the facts showed that Mr Samat was not well placed to make these observations.

56     Firstly, Mr Samat was sitting furthest from the 1st defendant. During cross-examination, he conceded that he was not able to observe everything and could not confirm every action which the 1st defendant did. Mr Samat could only confirm that he observed that the truck went up the road divider and went back down, before it collided with the pedestrians.[^19] He did not know whether the 1st defendant was applying the brakes or not, but that was what he thought so.[^20] This was partly because Mr Saiful was sitting in the middle, and Mr Samat would also not be able to see if the 1st defendant was stepping on the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.[^21]

57     Secondly, on further cross-examination, he also conceded that he did not know roughly what speeds the truck was travelling at,[^22] whether the truck was a manual or automatic transmission vehicle, or if there even was a clutch pedal in the truck.[^23] From the above, it was abundantly clear that Mr Samat was in no position to provide any credible testimony to support the assertion that the truck’s brakes were ineffective.

58     As for Mr Saiful, he was said to be uncontactable and was not called by the defendants to testify at the trial.[^24]

59     The last witness of fact in relation to the accident was the plaintiff. In her AEIC, the plaintiff testified that shortly before the incident, she and the deceased victim were on the pedestrian island, waiting for the lights to turn in their favour and they had waited for some time. Consistent with the observations of Mr Sim, the deceased victim was standing closest to the traffic light, followed by the plaintiff, and the third victim. The plaintiff further testified that neither the deceased victim nor she was playing with their mobile phones or listening to any music. They were talking to each other.

60     When she had noticed that the vehicles on the road had come to a stop, and the “Green Man” light came on in their favour, she took one step forward, when she saw from the corner of her eye, the truck heading at a fast speed toward them. The truck mounted the divider, and the plaintiff took one step backwards, but to no avail. She testified that she did not hear any warning sounds, but could only recall the truck coming towards her. She was also unable to recall precisely if her step backwards put her back on the pedestrian island, or if she was still on the crossing.[^25]

##### (2)   Disputed facts

61     I will now touch on the material disputes of fact in relation to the evidence of the plaintiff.

(A)   Plaintiff did not look left, right then left again before crossing

62     The first material dispute was whether the plaintiff did in fact look left, right and left again before crossing the road. The plaintiff had, in her oral testimony, informed the court that she had done so.[^26] However, this was not stated in her AEIC, and was only a bare allegation made under cross-examination that she had looked left, right and left again.[^27]

63     I further noted that her oral evidence was also contradictory in this regard. I reproduce salient portions of her evidence below:[^28]

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

Okay. Now, is it your case, that when the green man appeared, you left the pedestrian island, walked into road 2 in order to cross it?

 |
| 

A

 | 

I took one step forward and then the---this is where the green man was on. I took one step forward then I saw the truck heading towards me, so I took that step back, I took one step back. So, I was back on the island.

 |
| 

Q

 | 

When you took---after you took that one step back or rather when you took the one step into road 2, was that the first time you were seeing the 1st Defendant’s truck? Would you describe as the white truck?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

 | 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

So, therefore, when the green man came on, just before you saw the white truck, the green man had already come on and you have already taken a step forward.

 |
| 

A

 | 

Yes.

 |
| 

 | 

…

 |
| 

Q

 | 

Okay. Now, can I ask you, did you at anytime before you stepped onto the pedestrian. Before you took that first step into road 2, did you at anytime look to your left to observe the traffic?

 |
| 

A

 | 

Um, I am a pre-school teacher by job. So, before I cross the road, I look left, I look right and I look left again. So, that’s when I took the step forward. So, when I saw the truck coming towards me, I took the step back.

 |

  
  

64     From the above, it is apparent that the plaintiff’s initial position was that she had left the pedestrian crossing upon the lights turning in her favour, and thereafter saw the truck coming from the left. However, she then said that she had checked left, right and then left again to observe the traffic before crossing. These two positions cannot be reconciled. The plaintiff must have either started crossing upon the lights turning in her favour and checking her left thereafter, or only started walking upon checking left, right and then left again.

65     Under further cross-examination, the plaintiff then asserted that she had not seen the truck during her checking left, right and left prior to crossing the road, but had seen the truck after she had taken the first step onto the road.[^29] She attributed this to the possibility that the 1st defendant was making a turn lower down Clementi Avenue 6.[^30] However, this was not borne out on the facts. It is undisputed that the 1st defendant had turned onto Clementi Avenue 6 after exiting the AYE, and this was a relatively straight road which spanned approximately 2km. Mr Sim had also testified that he had clear vision of the road, up until the crest of the road where the river (or canal) was.[^31] This crest is about 200 metres from the pedestrian crossing.

66     In addition, the defendant’s counsel had also pointed out that the plaintiff had not mentioned this in her AEIC, nor at the criminal trial.[^32] This was also not observed by Mr Sim.

67     In the premises, I did not accept the evidence of the plaintiff that she had looked left, right and then left again before crossing the road.

(B)   Plaintiff was not on the pedestrian island at the point of impact

68     The second material issue which was disputed by parties was whether the plaintiff was on the pedestrian island at the point of impact. The defendants disagreed with the plaintiff’s contention that the plaintiff “was still on the pedestrian island at the point of impact given that she was standing relatively behind her deceased cousin”. Despite her indication that she was “unable to recall precisely if her step backwards put her back on the pedestrian island, or if she was still on the crossing” in her AEIC, the plaintiff testified during cross-examination that her step back put her back on the island.[^33]

69     I found that this contention could not be true on a balance of probabilities. I noted that Mr Sim testified that both the plaintiff and the third victim were positioned in front of the deceased victim at the material time, and upon alighting from the truck, Mr Samat saw both ladies on the left side of the vehicle.[^34] Further, it was observed by Mr Sim that the plaintiff’s right leg was run over by the left tyre of the truck. Whilst the plaintiff submitted that this was only Mr Sim’s assumption and he was not sure which tyre had run the plaintiff’s leg down, I found Mr Sim’s independent account credible.

70     The red-light camera photographs (reproduced below)[^35] also corroborated Mr Sim’s account that the plaintiff was closer to the left side of the truck and had been run over by the left tyre, as it was clear that the left side of the truck did not encroach onto the pedestrian island before, during or after the impact. I found it highly implausible that the two female victims would have been hit on the right side of the truck but be thrown over to the left side of the truck. The objective evidence, taken together with the testimony of the witnesses, was clear that the plaintiff could not have been on the pedestrian island at the point of impact.

![]([2020] SGDC 0262_Image/[2020] SGDC 0262_image2.png)

(C)   Conclusion on disputed facts

71     All things considered, I found that the plaintiff had started to cross without first satisfying herself that the approaching vehicles had come to a stop or were coming to a stop and was not on the pedestrian island at the point of impact.

##### (3)   Apportionment of damages

72     Section 3(1) of the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 2002 Rev Ed) requires the damages to “be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage”. In _Asnah_, the Court of Appeal pointed out (at \[118\]) that the two aspects which stood out in shaping the court’s determination of what is a “just and equitable” apportionment were:

> (a)     the relative causative potency of the parties’ conduct; and

> (b)     the relative moral blameworthiness of the parties’ conduct.

73     As operators of machines which have the potential to cause great harm, drivers tend to be the more culpable party, having regard to the “destructive disparity” between a driver and a pedestrian.

74     In the present case, the 1st defendant was driving a heavy vehicle, at a speed of over 50km/h whilst approaching a signalised crossing. Even if the truck did not hit the plaintiff, the potential harm of the truck ploughing into the end of a car or other small vehicle would also have unthinkable consequences. It was abundantly clear that there was a much higher degree of causative potency of the 1st defendant’s conduct, bearing in mind the speed at which he was travelling, the tonnage of his vehicle and the apparent ineffectiveness of the brakes, when compared to the appellant in _Asnah_.

75     The factual circumstances surrounding the victims of the respective cases (at present and in _Asnah_) are substantially similar, especially as they were preparing to cross a segment of the road from a “refuge” while the lights were in their favour. In _Asnah_, the victim had made it across the first half of the dual-carriageway crossing without any incident, but just as he took his second or third step into the second half of the crossing, he was knocked down by a taxi. The taxi was travelling at about 55km/h at the material time.

76     Whilst the plaintiff was not on the pedestrian island at the material point of time and she had started to cross without first satisfying herself that the approaching vehicles had come to a stop or are coming to a stop, the plaintiff had taken some precaution by crossing the road in compliance with the traffic signal.

77     I further noted that the victim in _Asnah_ was determined to not have checked for any approaching vehicular traffic. However, in the present case, it was not disputed that the plaintiff did look to the left at some point in time. In this regard, the extent of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence would be less than that of the Respondent in _Asnah_, especially when viewed against the relative moral blameworthiness of the conduct of the 1st defendant, and I would apportion it at 7.5% having regard to the circumstances of the present case. For ease of reference, a table comparing the salient facts which appear in both the present case and _Asnah_ is set out below:

#### Third party

78     The defendants asserted that the third party should indemnify the defendants wholly or for the bulk of the liability that the court finds against the defendants (if any), for their failure to exercise reasonable care and ensure that the vehicle’s brakes were in a serviceable and roadworthy condition at all material times.

##### (1)   Expert evidence presented at trial

79     Both the defendants and the third party called upon lay and expert witnesses to support their respective positions. I first deal with the evidence of the expert witnesses.

(A)   DW4 – Mr Kelvin Koay (“Mr Koay”)

80     The defendants called upon Mr Kelvin Koay, who was also their expert witness at the criminal trial in _Sun Xin Jian_. Mr Koay was a Professional Engineer, Traffic Accident Reconstructionist and Principal Forensic Consultant of Koays Consulting Pte Ltd, having over 40 years of professional experience in automotive and mechanical engineering. Mr Koay also had experience testifying as an expert witness in court.

81     Mr Koay was first instructed by the insurers on or about 22 November 2012 to investigate the truck’s brakes.[^36] Mr Koay was cognisant of the fact that there was an alleged issue with the truck’s brakes, as he had read the accident report furnished by the 1st defendant when he was instructed.[^37]

82     Mr Koay furnished his report dated 7 December 2012 in his AEIC (“Koay’s Report”), which was admitted in the criminal trial as well.[^38] He also provided a supplementary report dated 29 October 2018, commenting on Mr Ang Bryan Tani’s report.[^39]

83     From his evidence, Mr Koay took the same position that he had taken during the criminal trial.[^40] The general thrust of his evidence was that the brakes of the truck had become ineffective due to a maladjustment of the brakes by the third party. Mr Koay’s evidence was that the 1st defendant’s frequent application of brakes under heavy traffic conditions would have likely caused an overheating of the brakes, and such overheating would have been aggravated if the brakes were not adjusted properly.

(B)   TPW5 – Mr Tan Jiat Shee

84     Mr Tan Jiat Shee was the first expert witness which the third party called upon. He operated a consultancy business and was formerly employed as a Senior Automotive Engineer with STA Inspection Pte Ltd (“STA”) and had been in the same line of work since 1974. Mr Tan Jiat Shee was requested by the Traffic Police to carry out the inspection and accident assessment of the truck on or about 19 November 2012. In particular, he was asked to inspect the truck’s brakes, wheels, transmission, steering, and other mechanical systems and to provide his findings from the inspection.

85     Following his inspection on 20 November 2012, he prepared a report, which was used at the criminal trial of _Sun Xin Jian_ and also adduced as evidence in this proceeding. He subsequently received a further request from the Traffic Police on or about 4 December 2013 to conduct a re-test on the truck, and to provide his comments and opinion on Koay’s Report. Following his inspection on 20 January 2014, he prepared a report, which was also used at the criminal trial of _Sun Xin Jian_ and adduced as evidence in this proceeding.

86     Mr Tan Jiat Shee was of the opinion that the truck’s transmission, brake, and steering control systems were in good and serviceable condition.[^41] He noted that both the rear tyres were bald, which could hinder the braking efficiency, otherwise, no other mechanical defects were found which could have led to the accident.[^42]

87     When reviewing Koay’s Report and the braking result from STA (his employer at that point in time), Mr Tan Jiat Shee opined that the brake efficiency could have been low due to a few factors, which included:[^43]

> (a)     Tyre condition;

> (b)     Improper testing (where three repeated tests should be carried out); and

> (c)     Failing to depress brake pedal fully.

88     Mr Tan Jiat Shee was also of the view that the carrying out of a road test on a vehicle brake was a simple and real test, which was widely used by workshop mechanics, technicians, and engineers all over the world, to determine braking efficiency.[^44] He further noted that Mr Koay’s observation of there being an air leakage or a deficiency in the air brakes system was misconceived, as the dip in air pressure was normal.[^45]

89     Mr Tan Jiat Shee questioned why the ineffective brakes were not detected before the journey, when it was used for deliveries, and after the incident, when it was driven to the STA inspection centre. He also had doubts as to the assertion that there was an overheating of the rear brake drum that caused the brake failure, as there were no signs or symptoms which suggested the same. The truck was in use for only about 30 minutes, and it was unlikely that there would be overheating even under heavy traffic and the prolonged application of brakes.[^46] In any case, even if there was overheating, braking efficiency would revert to normal once the overheating has subsided.

90     On the whole, Mr Tan Jiat Shee was of the opinion that the accident was not caused by any improper adjustment of the brakes, nor was it caused by the brakes or braking system of the truck.[^47]

(C)   TPW6 – Mr Ang Bryan Tani (“Mr Ang”)

91     Mr Ang was the second expert witness which the third party called upon. He was a senior technical investigator and certified accident reconstructionist with LKK Auto Consultants Private Limited. Whilst he had no formal qualifications as far as heavy vehicles were concerned, he had been in this line of work since 2007,[^48] and was familiar with the subject matter. Mr Ang was appointed sometime on or about June 2018, to review the inspection reports of Mr Koay, the STA, and Mr Lim Chwee Hai (who was not called to provide evidence), and thereafter to provide his comments on whether the findings of Mr Koay were reasonable.

92     By the time Mr Ang was appointed by the third party, the truck was no longer available for inspection. Hence, he could only rely on his interviews with the personnel involved, and the photographs provided to him.

93     Mr Ang’s evidence was that the brake system of the truck was in serviceable condition at the material time of the accident, and/or the time when the third party returned the truck to the 2nd defendant on 5 November 2012, and that there was no evidence to suggest that the brakes were ineffective.[^49] Mr Ang’s evidence was also that as the STA brake test is carried out by humans, there was a reasonable chance that there would be human error, and a second test should have been conducted to reconfirm the first test which recorded a failure.[^50]

94     In arriving at his conclusion, Mr Ang had relied on his interviews with the personnel involved, perused the reports produced by the other expert witnesses and the photographs therein, and also sourced for exemplar vehicles – which were similar to the truck – to provide some basis for comparison, especially when they were subjected to brake tests.

95     The table below summarises his findings and the comparison between the three vehicles:

96     Mr Ang also pointed out that there was further doubt as to the accuracy of the roller brake test, as it did not accord with the actual operational behaviour of the truck’s brake system immediately before and after the test. He noted that Mr Koay, who had sat in the truck for both legs of the journey, did not state that he felt any ineffectiveness or issues with the truck’s braking system. It was expected that Mr Koay, being an expert in this field, would have been able to notice any issues with the truck, had these been present.

(D)   The law on expert evidence and my analysis

97     The law on dealing with expert evidence is set out in _Sakthivel Punithavathi v Public Prosecutor_ \[2007\] 2 SLR (R) 983 (“_Sakthivel_”) at \[74\] to \[76\], which has been affirmed in the case of _Armstrong, Carol Ann v Quest Laboratories Pte Ltd and another and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 133</span> at \[90\], a Court of Appeal case with a coram of five judges. The court’s determination as to whether it should accept parts of an expert’s evidence is guided by considerations of consistency, logic, and coherence. This would require a scrutiny of the expert’s methodology and the objective facts he had based his opinion upon. In considering conflicting expert evidence, it is the consistency and the logic of the preferred evidence that is paramount: per _Lim Chong Poon v Chiang Sing Jeong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGCA 27</span> at \[5\], affirming _Sakthivel_.

98     Applying the above, I found that Mr Koay’s evidence was lacking in many aspects, when superimposed with the objective facts. Under cross-examination, he conceded that he did not have any physical evidence that the brakes were improperly adjusted. His evidence was that it was his inference that the brakes had to be improperly adjusted, otherwise such an event would not have happened.[^51] Despite believing that this was the only plausible explanation for the brake failure, it begs the question that Mr Koay did not proceed to confirm his inference, by measuring or analysing the necessary components. It is noteworthy that Mr Koay was in a position to do so, considering that he had dismantled the rear brake drums for inspection and had taken nearly 60 photos.

99     It is also pertinent to note:

> (a)     that Mr Koay primarily arrived at his conclusions based on the interview with the 1st defendant;[^52] and

> (b)     that Mr Koay did not take any photographs or measurements of the pushrods or slack adjusters;[^53]

which could have shed light on what caused the brake failure. Mr Koay was also inconsistent at times - he conceded that for the journeys of the two earlier drivers (on 6 November 2012), he would not be surprised that there was no overheating of the brakes such that it would cause brake failure;[^54] yet at the same time he had disagreed that the third party had delivered the truck to the 2nd defendant in a good, serviceable, and roadworthy condition on 5 November 2012.[^55]

100    Whilst the exact usage of the truck during that period could not be ascertained, it would be illogical for the truck to have been empty, seeing that the 2nd defendant is a logistics company which used the truck for deliveries. That being the case, it again begs the question as to why Mr Koay did not find out how the truck was used for the preceding journeys, and the condition the truck was in. When probed on this in cross-examination, Mr Koay’s only response was that he was not engaged to do accident reconstruction.[^56]

101    Further, Mr Koay had also indicated that there are many other factors which could have resulted in the overheating of the brake and cracks to the brake drums, and that he could not confirm if the cracks were in fact caused by the maladjustment of the brakes resulting in binding and overheating. Some of these factors include:[^57]

> (a)     Improper brake adjustment;

> (b)     Application of brakes by the driver;

>> (i)       Frequency of braking;

>> (ii)       Duration of braking; and

>> (iii)       Force of braking.

> (c)     Loading of the vehicle;

> (d)     Speed of the vehicle.

102    The district judge in _Sun Xin Jian_ had analysed the same report and had come to the conclusion that Mr Koay had agreed that it was more likely that it was a case of constant inefficiency of the brakes as opposed to a sudden inefficiency of the brakes. This finding was highlighted during cross-examination but Mr Koay had testified that he would maintain his opinion that it was a case of sudden inefficiency. Mr Koay was invited to elaborate on this during re-examination but did not do so.[^58]

103    In my view, Mr Koay had not provided any objective evidence to buttress his conclusion that the inefficient brakes were a result of an improper brake adjustment by the third party. In the premises, even taking Mr Koay’s evidence at its highest, it was only an inference that the brakes were maladjusted.

104    On the other hand, I found Mr Tan Jiat Shee’s evidence to be consistent with the objective facts. Mr Tan Jiat Shee was requested by the Traffic Police to do mechanical inspections and assessments of the vehicle on 20 November 2012 and 4 December 2013. For the said inspections and assessments, he provided two reports, dated 20 November 2012 and 23 January 2014. These were provided when Mr Tan Jiat Shee was still working for the STA.

105    In both his reports, Mr Tan Jiat Shee did not come to the conclusion that the braking failure (if any) of the truck was attributable to overheating. In his earlier report which was premised on his inspection as at 20 November 2012, Mr Tan Jiat Shee had only highlighted that both the rear tyres were bald, which could hinder the braking efficiency, otherwise, all the other systems were in good and serviceable condition. In giving his oral evidence, Mr Tan Jiat Shee further highlighted that it was precisely because he found that the brake system looked okay, which was why there was no need for a further brake test. This would be consistent with the fact that the rear brakes were overhauled 1.5 months and the front brakes about 8 months before the accident.

106    In his subsequent report of 23 January 2014, Mr Tan Jiat Shee commented on the report provided by Mr Koay and rejected the assertion that there was brake failure due to overheating of the rear brake drum. Mr Tan Jiat Shee’s assertion that one can do a road test to test a vehicle’s brakes also corroborates the evidence provided by Mr Tan Kim Tow of the third party, who had also stated that a road test would be sufficient, bearing in mind that only experienced employees were allowed to do them. This was also consistent with the view of Mr Koay who stated that Mr Tan Kim Tow, as an experienced tester, would not have driven the vehicle out should he have found that the brakes were ineffective after an informal road brake test.[^59] It is pertinent that this incident took place shortly after the accident, and Mr Koay was cognisant of the fact that the 1st defendant had alleged that the brakes were not effective.

107    In view of the above, I preferred the consistent and logical analysis of Mr Tan Jiat Shee in respect of the condition of the truck over the evidence of Mr Koay.

108    Regarding Mr Ang’s evidence, as he only had the benefit of reviewing secondary evidence (i.e. the reports which were prepared by the other expert witnesses), and was not able to physically inspect the truck, I did not attribute substantial weight to his evidence. However, there was one aspect of his evidence which I found to be relevant in arriving at my decision.

109    Mr Ang’s provision of two “Exemplar Vehicles”, vehicles similar to the truck that exhibited the same type of marks on their brake drums – which Mr Koay referred to as “cracks” – provided a useful reference point for me to understand the context behind Mr Ang’s findings. Both “Exemplar Vehicles” were brought to an STA Inspection Centre for a roller brake test. Despite exhibiting the same cracks, both “Exemplar Vehicles” eventually passed the brake tests. What was more noteworthy was that Exemplar Vehicle 2 had recorded an overall pass for the first test, but a fail for the second test. This corroborates the evidence of both Mr Tan Jiat Shee and Mr Ang, that it was not unheard of for multiple brake tests to be done as there was a possibility for a false positive or negative result to be recorded.[^60]

110    Having covered the expert evidence, I now turn to consider the witnesses of fact who gave evidence during the third party proceedings.

##### (2)   Other evidence presented at third party proceedings

(A)   Defendants’ witnesses of fact

111    The defendants called upon two witnesses of fact – one Mr Ong Chong Kiat (DW2) (“Mr Ong”) and one Mr Ee Teck Lye (DW3) (“Mr Ee”) to testify. On balance, I found that the evidence provided by these two witnesses was uncontroversial and did not materially advance or support the defendants’ contentions.

112    Mr Ong had previously worked as a transport supervisor with the 2nd defendant. His AEIC pertained to the maintenance schedule of the truck and the 2nd defendant’s contractual relationship with the third party as well as what transpired prior to and after the accident. His testimony similarly centred around his duties as a transport supervisor,[^61] the contract between the 2nd defendant and the third party,[^62] and the circumstances leading to the repair and return of the truck before the incident,[^63] and was largely unchallenged in cross-examination.

113    Mr Ee was working as a vehicle inspector with the STA since 2007 and was involved in the brake inspection on the truck on 23 November 2012. His testimony centred around the circumstances surrounding the brake test of the truck,[^64] as well as brake test results generally.[^65] Whilst Mr Ee was involved in the inspection, he was situated about four metres away from the truck at the material time, as he was manning a computer to await the printing of the results.[^66] He was also not able to see in the inside of the truck from where he was standing as the doors were closed.[^67] Despite the foregoing, he insisted that the test results were accurate.[^68]

(B)   Third party’s witnesses of fact

114    The third party called upon four of their employees involved in the operations of their business to testify:

> (a)     Mr Lee Foo Lin (TPW1), who was the Marketing Executive of the Workshop who coordinated and liaised with the 2nd defendant;

> (b)     Mr Lai Teck Chuan (TPW2), who the Workshop Foreman;

> (c)     Mr Tan Kim Tow (TPW3), who was the Workshop Supervisor; and

> (d)     Mr Fang Hin Tin (TPW4) (“Mr Fang”), who was a driver at the Workshop.

115    On balance, I was satisfied that the testimony provided by these witnesses were generally coherent, and internally and externally consistent. I was also satisfied that the third party had an established operating procedure, which held up under cross-examination.

116    In essence, it was established that a job card would be issued for any vehicle which came into the workshop for repairs, and whilst various mechanics would be instructed to carry out the repairs, the final approving person would still be the Workshop Supervisor or the Foreman, who would certify on the job card that the job was completed and tested.

117    Mr Lai Teck Chuan, Mr Tan Kim Tow and one Mr Lin Dahui (“Mr Lin”) who was the mechanic in charge of the repairs (who did not appear at the trial) had filled up two job cards.[^69] The first indicated: “To provide towing; To overhaul clutch, replace clutch disc, bearing, flywheel assembly”[^70] and the second indicated: “maintenance servicing; smoke meter test; to conduct brake test; to replace fuel filter, old filter & engine oil; replace 1 x side light bulb; top up battery water”.[^71]

118    The defendants sought to discredit the employees of the third party alleging that the repairs to the truck were not done or were not done properly. Analysing the evidence, I found that the position adopted by the defendants was not borne out on the facts.

(C)   My analysis

119    The third party was called in to repair the truck as it had broken down on 4 November 2012 at 1.35pm, and the vehicle could not move. The truck had to be towed to the third party’s workshop.[^72]

120    The assertion that Mr Lin was not supervised when he was servicing the vehicle was not conclusive of any fact, as the staff understood that it was just a normal servicing job[^73] which could be handled by Mr Lin. Mr Tan Kim Tow testified that Mr Lin was working with the third party for about a year prior to the incident in 2012[^74] and was capable of carrying out the servicing alone as he had been taught to adjust the brakes, and he had done so on many other occasions as well[^75]. Mr Tan Kim Tow was also confident that Mr Lin could not have made the mistake of adjusting the brake improperly. I found this to be plausible, taking into consideration the relative simplicity in the steps described in adjusting the brakes:[^76]

> (a)     Using a spanner to adjust the pushrod, ensuring it moves in the direction of the brake chamber;

> (b)     Tightening the pushrod until it touches the brake drum; and

> (c)     Loosening the pushrod by three clicks to ensure that there is a clearance between the lining and the drum.

121    In my view, the repairs done would _prima facie_ have been of a suitable standard, considering that the previously broken down truck that had to be towed to the workshop was subsequently able to operate after the repairs done by the third party. The 2nd defendant’s Mr Ong had testified that the truck was delivered to the 2nd defendant on the evening of 5 November 2012 with its brakes and braking system in a good, serviceable and mechanical condition.[^77] Whilst Mr Tan Kim Tow conceded that he did not check the work of Mr Lin following the maintenance work on 5 November 2012, Mr Tan Kim Tow did do a road brake test at the workshop[^78] – which involved driving the vehicle around the compound and testing the brakes – and being satisfied with the condition of the vehicle, had approved it for release.[^79]

122    The defendants suggested that Mr Tan Kim Tow should have only used a machine test (as recommended by the manual), instead of a road brake test.[^80] However, I found that this did not accord with the industry practice.[^81] The defendant’s own expert witness, Mr Koay, was satisfied that Mr Tan Kim Tow was capable of testing if the brakes were ineffective during their journey to the STA to get the brakes tested.[^82] Mr Koay had even described this as an industry practice – which he termed a “morning parade”.[^83]

123    The third party’s Mr Fang had also driven the truck back to the 2nd defendant’s premises.[^84] It was pertinent that Mr Fang – an experienced driver with the third party for over 29 years – did not notice anything unusual with the truck.[^85] This supported the third party’s position that the repair works were done suitably.

124    Apart from checks by the third party, the evidence also showed that the 2nd defendant’s employees were required to do a pre-driving inspection prior to doing their deliveries. It must be noted that the 2nd defendant’s mode of ascertaining road worthiness of the vehicles was also for the drivers to drive one round around the warehouse premises to test the brakes,[^86] and a visual check for the tyres.[^87]

125    This meant that prior to the accident, the truck would have been inspected twice more by the 2nd defendant’s employees and would have been on two 12-hour shifts (from 6pm on 5 November 2012 to 6pm on 6 November 2012). However, no evidence was led by the defendants that the brakes were inefficient or ineffective during this time.

126    In relation to the failed brake test, I did not accord much weight to Mr Ee’s testimony. There was little basis for Mr Ee’s certainty as to the accuracy of the brake test result, when he had expressly admitted to not being able to remember the number of times the brake test was done,[^88] whether he witnessed the brake test,[^89] and the length of time elapsed since the test was conducted on 23 November 2012. When probed as to why he was certain the truck was tested twice, he testified that besides the fact that testing twice was part of their SOP,[^90] the brake test was a “special test”. When questioned further, he did not answer why it was a “special test”.[^91]

127    Considering the evidence in totality, it was clear to me that the defendants had failed to discharge their burden of proving that the third party was negligent and had breached their duty of care to them. While the documentation and practices of the third party may not have been perfect, I found the third party’s employees’ testimony coherent and consistent. They knew the standard operating procedures and adhered to them. In this regard, there was no credible evidence to support the position of the defendants that the truck was not roadworthy at the time it was returned by the third party.

#### (3)   New intervening act

128    In the present case, even taking the defendants’ case at their highest, I found that the third party would not be liable for causing the accident. This was because the 1st defendant had committed an intervening act which broke the chain of causation.

129    It is trite that in the law of negligence, the alleged tortfeasor may seek to absolve his liability where the chain of causation is broken by an intervening act, whether by the victim himself or by a third party: _Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ \[2006\] 3 SLR (R) 769 at \[108\] and \[133\]. An intervening act is one that takes place between the alleged tortfeasor’s negligent conduct and the damage, and it is only where the act or omission of such a party is of such a nature as to constitute a wholly independent cause of the damage, that the intervening conduct may be termed an intervening act: _TV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidi_ \[2004\] 3 SLR (R) 543 at \[76\].

130    It was established above that the 1st defendant was aware that the truck’s brakes were not as effective as his usual lorry from the start of the journey.[^92] Yet, he chose to continue doing the deliveries with the truck, and to drive at an unsafe speed.[^93]

131    Having embarked on a course of action which was deliberately rash, to both continue using the truck as well as drive it at an unsafe speed, the defendants cannot now say that they had relied on the third party’s representation that the vehicle was in a serviceable and roadworthy condition to hold the third party liable. Any negligence on the part of the third party would simply be rendered part of the history of events, as the 1st defendant’s action was an intervening act which broke the chain of causation.

## Conclusion

132    All things considered, the defendants had failed to discharge the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that the third party was liable to the defendants and were in breach of their duty of care. In this regard, the defendants had also not shown that the purported inefficiency of the brakes was attributable to the third party. Ultimately, I was of the view that it was the 1st defendant’s actions in driving the truck in the manner that he did, despite knowing that the brakes were not as effective as his usual vehicle, that caused the accident in question.

133    I accordingly found on 3 July 2020 that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff for 92.5% of the damages to be assessed by the registrar, with the 2nd defendant being vicariously liable for the negligence of the 1st defendant. I also dismissed the claim of the defendants against the third party and informed parties that I will hear them on costs and fix the costs of the trial and the third party action. Having heard the trial and the third party action, I was better placed as compared to the assessing registrar to determine costs and decided to deal with this issue upfront.

134    As the trial for Suit 3273 did not proceed against the defendants, parties asked that costs should be reserved to the registrar conducting the assessment. I agreed in the circumstances and recorded consent interlocutory judgement in Suit 3273 against the defendants for 90% of the damages to be assessed with costs reserved to the registrar hearing the assessment.

## Costs

135    Parties were then directed to file and exchange written submissions with regard to costs and a return date on 17 July 2020 was set for parties to submit on costs.

136    In their costs submissions and at the return date, the plaintiff highlighted that the quantum of damages exceeded the jurisdiction of the District Court and had been heard at the State Courts pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement on Jurisdiction pursuant to s 23 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321, 2007 Rev Ed). Accordingly, the Supreme Court guidelines for party-and-party costs under Paragraph 99B, Appendix G of the Supreme Court Practice Directions (“Costs Guidelines”) would apply. While acknowledging that the Costs Guidelines for a motor accident claim would entitle them to $66,000, the plaintiff sought an uplift to $90,000 in view of the work done. This included the fact that the action started in 2014, the need to review the evidence in relation to the criminal trial, the need to review and record statements of witnesses, the need to go through the documents to prepare the AEICs, the length of the trial, and taking over of the case from the previous lawyers for the plaintiff.

137    In their costs submissions and at the return date, the defendants asked that costs be deferred pending their appeal. They also suggested that costs should not be bifurcated. If costs were to be fixed, it was highlighted that the plaintiff was not actively involved with the issues connected with the third party and likewise, the third party was not actively involved in the issues at trial. In the premises, if the submission to defer was not accepted, they submitted a sum of $14,000 for the plaintiff and $20,000 for the third party. It was also submitted that the costs of the third party proceedings should be consolidated into a single costs order.

138    As for the third party, noting that the third party action was not a motor accident claim but one for an indemnity, they made reference to the Costs Guidelines entitling them to a sum of $105,600 and sought an uplift of that figure. This was in view of the length of time that the action spanned, the entirety of the criminal proceedings that had to be considered and the technical evidence in the case. In the circumstances, the third party sought costs of between $130,000 – $135,000 for Suit 848 and a separate sum of $20,000 for Suit 3273.

139    Having regard to the submissions, I agreed with the plaintiff and third party that there was no reason to adjourn the fixing of costs as it was axiomatic that an appeal did not operate as a stay. I also agreed with the third party that there should be separate orders for the third party proceedings in both actions.

140    While I saw some merit in the submissions of the defendants that the plaintiff and the third party would have been more active in different aspects of the trial, it was still necessary for them to follow the proceedings closely to safeguard the interests of their clients. At the same time, I noted that the reasons given for the purported uplift by the plaintiff and third party were part and parcel of the work that had to be done for any trial. I therefore saw no reason to depart from the sums specified in the Costs Guidelines.

141    Accordingly, at the conclusion of the costs hearing on 17 July 2020, I ordered as follows:

> (a)     Costs for the plaintiff to be fixed at $76,000 (applying $10,000 per day) plus GST and reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed;

> (b)     Costs for the third party in Suit 848 to be fixed at $99,000 (applying $15,000 per day) plus GST and reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed; and

> (c)     Costs for the third party in Suit 3273 to be fixed at $6,000 plus GST and reasonable disbursements to be agreed or taxed.

142    I also directed that any taxation of the disbursements should be fixed before me. On further reflection, rather than ordering the disbursements to be agreed or taxed, a more appropriate order would have been for the disbursements to be agreed or fixed by the court. In this regard, if the parties are unable to agree on the disbursements, I would be prepared to fix them instead with the agreement of parties rather than to have them taxed.
