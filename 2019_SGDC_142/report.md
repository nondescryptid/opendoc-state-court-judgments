### District Judge John Ng:

The Offender had pleaded guilty on 7 June 2019 and was sentenced on the same day for multiple drug and road traffic offences committed on different occasions. He is currently serving his total sentence of **13 years and 11 months of imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane** for 8 offences. Another 11 charges were taken into consideration for the sentence (“TIC charges”). He filed an appeal on 10 June 2019 from Prisons against the Sentence. 3 of the 8 offences which he had committed were repeat drug offences which carried mandatory minimum sentences. These were the repeat drug trafficking offence (mandatory minimum imprisonment of 10 years and 10 stokes of the cane), the repeat drug possession offence (mandatory minimum imprisonment of 2 years) and the LT-1 drug consumption offence (mandatory minimum imprisonment of 5 years and 3 strokes of the cane).

2       The following is a table of the 8 charges proceeded with, together with the dates of the offences:

## BRIEF FACTS OF THIS CASE

#### Offence committed on 7 February 2017

3       The Offender was first arrested by officers from the Central Narcotic Bureau (“CNB”) on 7 February 2017 at 6 Fishery Port Road, Singapore, for the offence of possession of a controlled drug. Two packets of drugs were found on him and analysis by the Health Science Authority (“HSA”) found the two packets to contain not less than 1.63 grams of Methamphetamine. The Offender admitted to the ownership of these two packets and said that he knew they contained Methamphetamine which were for his personal consumption. The Offender was released on agency bail.

#### Offence arising from his second arrest on 8 August 2017

4       On 8 August 2017, the Offender was re-arrested by the police officers at 400 Orchard Road, Orchard Towers, Singapore, for suspected drug-related offence. Urine samples were procured from him and sent to HSA on 10 August 2017 for analysis. The urine samples were found to contain Methamphetamine. The Offender admitted that he last smoked “_Sejuk_” (street name in Malay for Methamphetamine) on 4 August 2017. The Offender was again released on bail and absconded from attending his court mention on 10 October 2017.

#### Offences committed on 5 December 2017

5       On 5 December 2017, at about 8:30am, the Offender was driving the vehicle SLR3756X along Killiney Road towards the direction of River Valley Road, when he collided into the rear of a stationary vehicle SJJ7807Y. The latter vehicle was driven by an ‘Uber’ driver, one Tan Wilson, and Wilson had stopped his vehicle to comply with the red-light signal at the traffic junction. The Offender failed to keep a proper lookout when driving. He would not have collided into Wilson’s vehicle if he had driven his vehicle in an orderly and careful manner, and with due regard for the safety of others. After the collision, the Offender and Wilson agreed to pull over by the side of the road so as not to hold up traffic. However, instead of pulling over, the Offender fled the scene.

6       As a result of the collision, Wilson felt pain at his neck area and suffered from migraines. He visited a doctor and was given medical leave of five days. The rear of Wilson’s vehicle was slightly dented as a result of the collision. At the material time, the Offender did not possess a valid Class 3 driving licence. There was also not in force in relation to the use of the vehicle driven by the Offender a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks.

#### Offence committed on 14 December 2017

7       On 14 December 2017, police officers from Tanglin Division attended to a complaint involving a case of drugs and drug utensils recovered from inside a silver Toyota Corolla vehicle bearing car plate number SKZ 8649J located at 47 Jalan Pemimpin Halcyon 2. A search was conducted inside the vehicle and two glass apparatus and two straws were recovered. Investigations revealed that the Offender was the driver of the vehicle at that material time. The said recovered items were in the possession of the Offender and were intended for the consumption of controlled drugs.

#### Failing to report for urine test on 26 February 2018

8       The Offender was placed under compulsory supervision for 24 months from 9 September 2016 to 8 September 2018 by virtue of Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3, 1999 Rev Ed). The Offender was required to present himself for urine tests at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters every Monday and Friday of each month from 9.30am to 10.00pm commencing on 16 September 2016 as directed by his Supervision Officer except on public holidays. However, the Offender failed to present himself for his urine test on 26 February 2018 at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters. He had no valid medical certificates or reasons to excuse his absence. By virtue of the foregoing, the Offender had committed an offence under Regulation 15(3)(f) of the Regulations and punishable under Regulation 15(6)(a) of the Regulations.

#### Trafficking offence committed on 1 March 2018

9       On 1 March 2018, the Offender was again re-arrested by CNB officers after he was caught red-handed selling drugs to an undercover CNB officer. At about 1.00 p.m., undercover CNB officer, Inspector Hazel, contacted the Offender through ‘WhatsApp’ to order ‘half set’ (also known as half set of ‘Ice’ which is the street name for Methamphetamine). The Offender agreed to sell ‘half set’ of ‘Ice’ to her for $180. On the same day, at about 7.00p.m., Inspector Hazel met the Offender and he handed her a tissue packet containing one packet of ‘Ice’. She then gave the Offender $180 in return. The packet of “Ice” was sent to HSA for analysis and it was found to contain not less than 1.57 grams of Methamphetamine.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE

11     The DPP had put up a comprehensive submissions pressing for the sentences for the repeat drug trafficking offence and the LT-1 drug consumption offence to run consecutively. In gist, the DPP submitted that these two offences and the driving offence should be ordered to run consecutively to ensure that each legally-protected interest is properly vindicated.

12     The DPP’s arguments for the custodial sentences of the repeat trafficking offence and the LT-1 drug consumption offence to run consecutively are highly persuasive. These two offences are separate and clearly distinct. The law against drug trafficking and repeat drug abuse are protecting different public interests.

13     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of slightly more than **15 years’ imprisonment and the mandatory minimum total of 13 strokes** of the cane to be imposed. The DPP also cited the aggravating factors of TIC charges and the commission of offences whilst the Offender was on bail. She had taken into account the totality principle by proposing a slight downward adjustment to the individual sentences. The DPP concluded that “the suggested global sentence cannot be said to be crushing in light of the accused’s demonstrable recalcitrance, having reoffended time and again each time after he was released on bail. By the third arrest, the accused demonstrated an escalation in criminal behaviour by reoffending with the even more serious offence of drug trafficking, after having absconded while on court bail for other drug-related offences. The accused’s criminal records are also telling of his (poor) commitment to rehabilitation, and is indicative of an offender who has a high risk of reoffending. It goes without saying, therefore, that a deterrent sentence is necessary.”

## MITIGATION

14     The Offender pleaded for leniency and implored the Court not to order the sentences for the drug trafficking and the LT-1 drug consumption offences to run consecutively. In his handwritten letter of mitigation penned in prison, he concluded with this: “Without much further ado, I would like to state that I plead guilty to the charges served against me without any qualifications, and I bear full responsibility for all my mistakes. At this point, I humbly implore for your greatest compassion and leniency in meting out a global sentence for me. Your kind understanding and consideration is very much appreciated. Thank You.”

## REASONS FOR THE SENTENCE

15     It is important to point out that at the end of the day, the total sentence has to be commensurate with the gravity of the offences and the circumstances by which they were committed, bearing in mind the type of offender before me. These grounds of my sentencing decision will not address the number of strokes for caning to be imposed, as the 13 strokes of caning ordered were the mandatory minimum for the relevant offences – 10 strokes for the repeat drug trafficking and 3 strokes for the LT-1 drug consumption. In calibrating the individual sentences, I have taken into account the mitigating factor that he had pleaded guilty at the mentions stage of proceedings.

##### The Sentencing of a Multiple Offender

16     The Offender before me for sentencing is a “multiple offender”. In the recent case of _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> (“_Raveen_”), Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon used the description of “multiple offender” at \[36\] of that judgment to describe an offender who is to be sentenced for convictions on multiple offences. In _Raveen_, CJ Menon derived an analytical framework for sentencing a multiple offender. A summary of the relevant principles in that framework can be found at \[98\] of that judgment. The first stage of the sentencing analysis is to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence. The second stage is to determine how the individual sentences should run.

17     The starting point at the second stage is to decide whether the offences are unrelated. This is determined by considering whether they involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences which form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed (“CPC”).

18     The third stage is to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality. If an aggregate sentence is considered excessive, the sentencing court may opt for a different combination of sentences to run consecutively or adjust the individual sentences.

##### Application of the Framework to the facts of this case

19     I applied the above analytical framework in sentencing the Offender, taking care to observe all the relevant principles enunciated therein, including in particular the Aggregation Principle which was reiterated in the subsequent Court of Appeal case of _Muhammad Sutarno Bin Nasir v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGCA 43</span> _(“Sutarno”)_. It is predominantly this Aggregation Principle which was of particular concern to me for the Offender in this case. If not for this Aggregation Principle, the Prosecution’s submissions to run the sentences for the repeat drug trafficking offence and the LT-1 drug consumption offence consecutively and for a global sentence of at least 15 years would not have been excessive.

20     The mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and 10 strokes for the repeat trafficking offence is sufficient in view of the small quantity of the drugs sold to the undercover CNB officer. The sentence of imprisonment imposed for the LT1 drug consumption offence was not the mandatory minimum 5 years but higher at 6 years’ imprisonment due to the presence of a TIC charge for a similar offence of LT-1 consumption. Similarly, the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment for the repeat drug possession charge was not imposed as there were 3 other repeat drug possession charges to be taken into account. Therefore, the individual sentence for the repeat drug possession offence was calibrated at 3 years’ imprisonment.

21     As for the charge in DAC 920062/2018 for the offence of Failure to Report for Urine Test, a sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment was imposed as the Offender had previously been sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment for a similar offence in 2015. There is also the need to take into account the two other charges of Failure to Report for Urine Tests in DAC 920060/2018 and DAC 920061/2018 which had to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. For the offence of possession of drug utensils, there being another charge for a similar offence to be taken into consideration, a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment was passed. This was ordered to run concurrently.

#### Sentences for the offences connected with the driving of a vehicle

22     The offences connected with the driving of the vehicle all occurred on the same day of 5 December 2017. The charges proceeded with and for which he was convicted of were that of driving without a licence, driving without insurance and failure to drive in a careful manner. I agreed with the Prosecution that a short custodial sentence is warranted for the offence of driving without licence given the accused’s poor driving records. He is a recalcitrant offender. Deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration, and the custodial threshold has been crossed. I considered that a global sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment for all the 3 connected driving offences (and TIC charges) would be appropriate in view of the following circumstances. The Offender had caused an accident with another vehicle. There was damage to the vehicles and injuries suffered by the other driver. The Offender had also driven off after seemingly agreeing with the other driver to stop at the side of the road.

##### Running of the sentences

23     On the issue of which sentences are to be run consecutively or concurrently, guidance can be had from the case of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”). According to the High Court in that case, the first rule that the sentencing judge should consider is the one-transaction rule. The 5 drug offences for which sentences were passed are clearly distinct in the circumstances from which they were committed. The 5 drug offences occurred on 5 separate dates over the span of a year.

24     DAC 909760/2017 for repeat drug possession occurred on 7 February 2017. DAC 920057/2018 for LT-1 drug consumption took place on or about 8 August 2017, whilst he was on bail for the drug possession offence. The possession of drug utensils happened on 14 December 2017. On 26 February 2018, he failed to report for his urine test and finally, the repeat drug trafficking offence was committed on 1 March 2018.

25     CJ Menon held in _Raveen_ (at Paragraph 41) that: “… as a general rule, a multiple offender who had committed unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence, and this should be achieved by an order that the individual sentences run consecutively.” Therefore, it would have been entirely reasonable and sound in principle to order the sentences for the suggested 3 offences of repeat drug trafficking, drug consumption and unlicensed driving to be run consecutively. I would have accepted the Prosecution’s submissions on this point if not for the Aggregation Principle within the Totality Principle, which is considered next.

26     The Totality Principle, as spelt out in _Shouffee_, is a principle of limitation and is a manifestation of the requirement of proportionality. This Totality Principle has two limbs. The first limb examines whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. In the present case, 3 out of the 8 offences proceeded with carried mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years 10 strokes for the repeat drug trafficking offence, 5 years 3 strokes for the LT-1 drug consumption offence and 2 years for the repeat drug possession offence. A global sentence of at least 15 years’ imprisonment, as proposed by the DPP, might have been regarded as substantially above the more serious of the offences committed.

27     The second limb of the Totality Principle considers whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and his future prospects. This requires the court to take a last look at all the facts and circumstances and assess whether the sentence looks wrong. I would not say that the overall sentence of at least 15 years’ imprisonment submitted by the Prosecution would be crushing on the offender in the circumstances of this case.

28     However, of more pertinent consideration would be the Aggregation Principle, first referred to as such in _Raveen’s case_ (at Paragraph 79 of that case) and then in _Sutarno’s case_ as follows:

“… The aggregation principle recognizes the fact that aggregation in such cases may result in a compounding effect that bears more than a linear relation to the overall criminality of the case, and that longer sentences may induce feelings of hopelessness that destroy the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration. …” (at Paragraph 24)

29     To give effect to the Aggregation Principle, I acceded to the Offender’s plea not to run the repeat drug trafficking sentence and the sentence for the LT-1 drug consumption offence consecutively. Besides the Aggregation Principle to be applied within the Totality Principle, there is nothing to bring the level of punishment down. I gave effect to the Aggregation Principle in this case by running the sentences for the repeat drug trafficking, the repeat possession of drugs, the repeat failure to report for urine test and the unlicensed driving consecutively.

30     Of significance in the context of this case is the consecutive running of the sentence of 3 years for the repeat possession of drugs and the sentence of 9 months for the repeat failure to report for urine test. These 2 sentences were ordered to run consecutively amounting to 3 years and 11 months instead of the sentence of 6 years for the LT-1 drug consumption offence to give effect to the Aggregation Principle. All these 3 offences could be said to be directly connected to the Offender’s consumption of drugs although the law for these 3 offences tackle different aspects of a person’s addiction to drugs.

31     In summary, if I had accepted the DPP’s principled argument to run the LT-1 drug consumption sentence consecutively, the Offender would have been sentenced to 16 years and 2 months of imprisonment. However, I decided that the Aggregation Principle ought to feature in this case and therefore, the overall sentence was structured differently and the Offender was sentenced to a total of 13 years and 11 months of imprisonment instead.

## CONCLUSION

32     The dominant sentencing principle in this case is Deterrence – both General and Specific Deterrence. The sentences imposed for the offences committed by the Offender in this case properly reflect his overall criminality and are in line with sentencing precedents. The overall sentence had taken into account the need for both general and specific deterrence with the appropriate reduction in the individual sentences to adhere to the Aggregation Principle. Overall, it was a global sentence which sought to balance the opposing forces of applying the General Rule of Consecutive Sentences for Unrelated Offences without infringing the Aggregation Principle within the Totality Principle. The sentence was backdated to take effect from 3 March 2018.
