Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Forms of punishment – Probation

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Forms of punishment – Insulting the modesty of a woman

2 September 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Paul Chan:

1       The Accused, Mr Tien Kiat Chong, is a Singapore citizen, aged 26. He pleaded guilty to a single amalgamated charge. The charge states that he took upskirt videos of young female strangers in public places on 19 different occasions. The Defence argued strenuously that a probation order should be made in view of, among other things, the fact that he has, since his arrest almost three years ago, taken significant steps to secure his own rehabilitation, including seeking psychological treatment. I provide the following judgment to explain why I cannot accede to this request.

## The charges

2       The Accused pleaded guilty to the following charge.

> You,… are charged that you, on 19 occasions between 28 May 2019 and 4 September 2019, in Singapore, did intrude upon the privacy of a woman with intent to insult that woman’s modesty, _to wit_, by using your mobile phone to record an upskirt video of her, amounting to 19 separate incidents of the commission of an offence under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), which taken together amount to a course of conduct, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 509 of the said code, which charge is amalgamated pursuant to section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012, Rev Ed).

3       The Accused also consented to having another charge of possessing 37 obscene films in his mobile phone, an offence under section 30(2)(a) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed), taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## Facts

4       A summary of the relevant facts, as contained in the Statement of Facts which the Accused has admitted to without qualification, is set out below.

> 2.    On 4 September 2019, at around 7.10pm to 7.15pm, the accused was on an escalator travelling upwards at Sengkang MRT station located at 5 Sengkang Square, Singapore. He noticed an unknown female wearing a denim skirt (“**the victim**”) also on the escalator and decided to take an upskirt video of her. The accused stood two steps below the victim and placed his left leg on the step below (i.e. the step just below the step that the victim was standing on). He placed his mobile phone (a Huawei P10 Plus mobile phone), with the camera facing upwards, on his left knee, positioned his leg near to the victim and attempted to record a video from beneath her skirt. A witness saw what the accused was doing and immediately suspected something was wrong. He alerted the station staff.

> 3.    The accused was approached by the station staff and the witness, but denied that he was trying to take an upskirt video of the victim. When the station staff requested to check his mobile phone, the accused was reluctant to hand over his mobile phone, but did so after checking through it for a while. The station staff and witness looked through the gallery of the accused’s mobile phone and found a video recorded of a woman by the accused while he was standing behind her on an escalator. They eventually handed him over to police officers who were patrolling in the area. Prior to him being handed over to the police, the accused said he was very sorry, and asked the witness and station staff if they could forget about what happened. He said that he was still studying, and again said that he was very sorry.

> 4.    In his statement to the police recorded on 4 September 2019, at about 9.55pm, the accused denied that he had taken any upskirt videos. He said that he had wanted to record a video capturing the face of the unknown female, but only managed to record a video of her “back view”.

> 5.    The accused’s mobile phone was seized as a case exhibit. A total of 19 upskirt videos were extracted from the accused’s mobile phone. The women in the videos could not be identified.

> 6.    On 30 June 2020, at about 2.00pm, the accused went to Woodlands Police Division to provide a further statement. Before recording a further statement from the accused, the investigation officer asked the accused if he had anything to say. The accused admitted that he had recorded upskirt videos of women. After being shown the 19 upskirt videos, the accused admitted that the videos were all recorded by him between 28 May to 4 September 2019. 17 of the upskirt videos were recorded on escalators in public places, 1 was recorded in a Mass Rapid Transit train, and 1 was recorded in a retail shop. The upskirt videos captured the panties, buttocks, and/or inner or upper thighs of the women. The accused would see women wearing skirts or dresses, feel an urge to take upskirt videos of them, follow behind them, and then position his mobile phone to take videos of them from beneath their skirts or dresses without their knowledge. He knew that by doing so, he was intruding upon the privacy of a woman with intent to insult her modesty. The accused would review the videos at home, or when he was alone.

> 7.    In addition, a total of 37 other obscene videos were also extracted from the accused’s mobile phone.

## Prescribed penalty

5       The Accused was charged under section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “**Penal Code**”). The penalty prescribed for such an offence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, a fine, or both. As the charge is an amalgamated one, the prescribed punishment is enhanced by two times under section 124(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

6       It may be noted that section 509 of the Penal Code has since been repealed by the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019. In its place, Parliament has enacted, among other provisions, section 377BB(4) and the prescribed penalty for a single offence of taking an upskirt photograph or video has been increased. An offender may now be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments. However, as the relevant part of the Criminal Law Reform Act 2019 only came into operation on 1 January 2020, the Accused is not liable to be charged under the section 377BB(4) of the amended Penal Code.

## Antecedents

7       The Accused is untraced.

## Parties’ positions

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

8       The Prosecution submitted that this Court should not make a mandatory treatment order (“**MTO**”) under section 339(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“**CPC**”) or a probation order (“**Probation Order**”) under section 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act 1951 (“**POA**”). This is because the sentencing principle of deterrence outweighs that of rehabilitation in the present case. In this regard, the Prosecution relied on the applicability of both general and specific deterrence. Insofar as general deterrence is concerned, the Prosecution referred to the serious nature of voyeurism offences, the committing of the offences in public places and the use of a camera phone by the Accused.

9       The Prosecution submitted that the Accused should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of between 10 to 12 weeks. This position was taken in view of the repeated offending, the use of a recording device and the deliberate nature of the offences. In coming to this position, the Prosecution gave some - but not substantial weight - to the fact that the Accused has chosen to plead guilty. Having regard to the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Ng Chee Kai, Darren_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGMC 10</span> (“**_Darren Ng_**”), _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 69</span> (“**_Chong Hou En_**”), _Public Prosecutor v Ang Wei Sheng_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGMC 28</span> (“**_Ang Wei Sheng_**”), _Public Prosecutor v Lee Chee Hoong_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 242</span> (“**_Lee Chee Hoong_**”) and _Public Prosecutor v Ryan You Jun Chao_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 42</span> (**_Ryan You_**”), the Prosecution submitted that a sentence of between 10 to 12 weeks’ imprisonment would be fair and appropriate.

### Mitigation plea and Defence’s submissions on sentence

10     At the first hearing of this matter, the Defence urged this Court to call for pre-sentencing suitability reports to consider whether to make an MTO or Probation Order. This was done. After the MTO suitability report returned with an unfavourable assessment, the Defence only pursued the argument that a Probation Order should be made. In the Defence’s view, the present case is not one where “the need for deterrence has eclipsed the relevance of rehabilitation”. In this regard, the Defence highlighted that the Accused has pleaded guilty at an early stage and has voluntarily sought medical assistance to address his voyeuristic disorder. He also has positive avenues to channel his energy, familial support and motivation to do well in his studies.

11     In the event that this Court is not with the Defence on the issue of probation, the Defence submitted that the Accused should be sentenced to a custodial term of up to 10 weeks’ imprisonment. In addition to the cases of _Darren Ng_, _Ryan You_ and _Lee Chee Hoong_ which the Prosecution also relied upon, the Defence cited the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Lian Koon_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 39</span> (“**_Tan Lian Koon_**”) and _Public Prosecutor v Koh Rong Gui_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 157</span> (“**_Koh Rong Gui_**”)

## Expert and probation reports

12     A number of reports were placed before this Court for the purpose of sentencing. As these reports have a material bearing on the outcome of this case, I shall set out their contents in some detail.

### The psychological reports

13     Two psychological reports were placed before this Court. One was provided by Dr Adaline Ng (“**Dr Ng**”) who was a Senior Principal Clinical Psychologist with Better Life Psychological Medicine Clinic. Dr Ng was acting on the instructions of the Defence. Dr Ng’s report really comprised two documents – an initial report dated 11 January 2021 and a supplementary letter dated 29 April 2021. Another psychological report was provided by Dr Ken Ang Lip Tat (“**Dr Ang**”) who was a Forensic Psychologist with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (“**MSF**”). Dr Ang provided his report, dated 4 May 2022, at the probation officer’s request for the purpose of assessing the psychological dynamics underlying the Accused’s offending and his risk of sexual recidivism.

14     In coming to their opinions, both Dr Ng and Dr Ang relied upon factual accounts recounted by the Accused, although Dr Ang also spoke to the Accused’s mother and had access to other secondary material provided by individuals who knew the Accused at various points in his life. The background information set out in these reports is largely similar and may be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The Accused is a middle child in his family comprising his mother, an elder brother (aged 30) and a younger brother (aged 24). The Accused’s parents were divorced before the Accused enrolled in primary school. The Accused shared that he was not affected by the divorce and he went on access outings with his father until he was approximately 17 years old.

> (b)     When the Accused was growing up, the Accused’s mother was frequently busy with work and returned home late at night. The Accused described her as “mostly absent”. Hence, the primary caregivers for the Accused and his brothers when they were younger were various foreign domestic helpers hired by his mother. That said, the Accused’s mother provided adequate supervision, enforced discipline, controlled her children’s whereabouts and monitored her children’s homework and schedules. The Accused’s relationships with his mother and his brothers were described as cordial. There was no discussion of healthy sexuality at home when the Accused was growing up.

> (c)     As regards interpersonal relationships, the Accused appeared to have few friends throughout his life. The Accused reported to Dr Ang that he felt it easier to connect with peer-aged females and had approximately six to seven romantic relationships since he was 14 years of age.

> (d)     Insofar as the Accused’s psychosexual history is concerned, the Accused was first introduced to pornography by a friend in primary school but only regularly assessed pornography when he was 14 years old. He watched pornography using his mobile phone after school in his room and intentionally searched for upskirt videos after coming across such videos in the early stages of his pornography use. The Accused reported that he was more sexually aroused by upskirt videos than consensual adult sex pornography. The frequency of his pornography was reported to have peaked during the years when the Accused attended an Institute of Technical Education (“**ITE**”) and, thereafter, a polytechnic. The Accused also disclosed that, during this period, he had sexual thoughts of upskirt videos almost every other day.

> (e)     The Accused’s onset of sexual offending preceded the offences for which he is currently charged. His first attempt at taking an upskirt video took place in 2010 when he was in secondary two. He was caught red-handed and was disciplined by his school. The next time he committed a similar offence was when he was in ITE. The Accused reported that he took upskirt videos regularly when he was in ITE.

> (f)     The Accused’s accounts to Dr Ng and to Dr Ang of the frequency of his voyeurism during the period he was in a polytechnic appears to differ slightly. To Dr Ng, the Accused reported that although the frequency of his voyeurism when he was in a polytechnic decreased as compared to when he was in ITE, he was unable to restrain himself completely. Dr Ng stated in her report that the Accused would make sporadic attempts to stop his voyeurism but would relapse after about two weeks’ abstinence. To Dr Ang, the Accused claimed that he managed to stop taking upskirt videos from late 2016, when he was in the second year of his polytechnic course. This was due to his desire to focus on his studies as he wanted to qualify for university and a heightened fear of being caught (due to the proliferation of news on sexual offenders).

> (g)     Be that as it may, both Dr Ng’s and Dr Ang’s reports stated that the Accused stopped taking upskirt videos completely when he was serving his national service. This was because he spent a large amount of time in an army camp and did not possess a phone with a camera. However, he continued to watch upskirt videos as part of his pornography use during this period.

> (h)     After his national service, the Accused re-obtained a mobile phone with camera functions. He again started taking upskirt videos. He reported to Dr Ng that he “couldn’t resist when there’s an opportunity”. While he did try to stop such offending conduct in July 2019, he was unable to sustain his abstinence beyond two weeks.

> (i)     Overall, the Accused confided in Dr Ang that he had taken approximately 40 upskirt videos over the span of six years from 2013 to 2019. Both Dr Ng and Dr Ang reported that the Accused would feel a sense of accomplishment in taking upskirt videos. Dr Ang further noted that the fact that the Accused was not caught on these occasions emboldened the Accused and the fact that the Accused masturbated to the videos he took perpetuated his deviant sexual interest. The Accused also acknowledged that his failure to consider the impact of his actions on his victims also led him to repeat such conduct.

15     In Dr Ng’s professional opinion, the Accused suffers from voyeuristic disorder. The Accused’s voyeuristic acts provided sexual satisfaction and also functioned as emotion regulation; it was a way in which the Accused coped with his low mood and loneliness. Dr Ng opined that the Accused’s voyeuristic disorder played a contributory role in his offences as the compulsive nature of the disorder “would have moderately compromised on his ability to refrain from acting on his voyeuristic urges”. In support of this conclusion, Dr Ng highlighted that the Accused was unable to abstain from voyeuristic offending beyond two weeks. Dr Ng recommended that the Accused receive psychological treatment. She opined that “\[r\]eceiving treatment in a community setting, as opposed to an incarcerated setting, will minimise the exacerbation of \[the Accused’s\] social isolation which is a contributing factor to his offending behaviour.”

16     Dr Ang agreed with Dr Ng that the Accused suffers from voyeuristic disorder. In Dr Ang’s view, the Accused’s offending stemmed from a combination of the following factors: sexual preoccupation, sexual fantasies about the victims’ underwear, easy access to victims, the absence of immediate consequences, the Accused’s failure to consider the negative impact of his actions on his victims and the lack of self-management strategies to manage his sexual urges when faced with high-risk situations. Dr Ang assessed the Accused’s risk of sexual reoffending, relative to other adults who had sexually offended in the community, to be “Moderate-High”. In coming to this conclusion, Dr Ang considered unfavourable factors, such as the Accused’s early onset of offending, absence of a prolonged live-in romantic relationship for at least two years, his current offences and the fact that the offences were committed against strangers and non-familial victims. Dr Ang also considered favourable factors, including the Accused’s cessation of deviant voyeuristic pornography, the Accused’s attempts to keep himself meaningfully occupied, support from his family and the Accused’s motivation to continue with his education. Ultimately, Dr Ang concluded that while the Accused’s offending was chronic and high in frequency, “there was no further information to suggest an imminent risk of sexual recidivism at this juncture.” Dr Ang recommended that the Accused receive an offence-specific intervention by a mental health professional.

### The probation report

17     An assessment of the Accused’s suitability for probation was provided by Ms Famirah Farhana, a Senior Probation Officer with the Probation and Community Rehabilitation Service (“**Ms Farhana**”). In preparing her report, Ms Farhana contacted a wide range of individuals who are or were involved in the Accused’s life.

18     In her report, Ms Farhana highlighted the risk and protective factors relevant to the Accused. Insofar as risk factors were concerned, Ms Farhana pointed out that the Accused was poor at self-regulation, had a risk-taking attitude and had limited consequential thinking. The fact that there was limited parental supervision and guidance on sexuality issues allowed the Accused opportunities to access pornography and, ultimately, predisposed him to sexual offending behaviour. On the other hand, the Accused had the ability to adapt to pro-social norms and was responsive to authority. The Accused also displayed a degree of awareness of his risk factors and had put in effort to mitigate them. He did this by attending counselling with a school counsellor, reducing his use of pornography and ceasing to watch deviant pornographic content since his arrest in September 2019.

19     Considering all relevant factors, Ms Farhana recommended that the Accused be placed on 18 months supervised probation, with appropriate conditions to be imposed.

### The MTO reports

20     Dr Chan Chun Ting (“**Dr Chan**”), a Psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health, interviewed the Accused on 5 May 2022 and provided a report dated 17 May 2022. In his initial report, Dr Chan opined that the Accused did not suffer from a mental illness prior to his arrest by the police in September 2019. Dr Chan was also of the view that the Accused is aware of his actions and that he was not of unsound mind at the material time of the offences. Ultimately, Dr Chan concluded that the Accused is not a suitable candidate for an MTO.

21     Given that Dr Ng and Dr Ang had diagnosed the Accused as having suffered from voyeurism disorder, it was curious that Dr Chan was of the view that the Accused did not suffer from a mental illness. At the Defence’s request, this Court invited Dr Chan to provide a clarificatory report to explain the basis for his opinion. This he did on 19 August 2022. Dr Chan explained that, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, one of the requirements before a diagnosis of voyeurism disorder should be made is that the attempts by the offender to act on his sexual urges or his urges and actions have caused significant distress or impairment to functioning at work, in social situations, or in other important areas. From the available information, the Accused was able to manage both work and university studies. He was also able to maintain romantic relationships with females. Accordingly, Dr Chan was of the view that the Accused did not meet this requirement. Nevertheless, he agreed that the treatment options presented by Dr Ng and Dr Ang are “sound options in managing \[the Accused’s\] voyeuristic behaviour”.

## Issues

22     There are two critical issues for this Court’s determination, as follows:

> (a)     Whether an MTO or probation order should be made.

> (b)     If not, what is the appropriate sentence that should be imposed.

## Issue 1: Whether an MTO or probation order should be made

23     The first issue to consider is whether an MTO or probation order should be made. If this issue is answered in the affirmative, it would be unnecessary to consider what sentence should be imposed.

### The MTO

24     After the two MTO reports were received, the Defence did not further pursue the argument that an MTO should be made. Nevertheless, I address this point for completeness.

25     Under section 339(3) of the CPC, an MTO may only be ordered if the appointed psychiatrist certifies that three conditions are satisfied: (i) the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment; (ii) the offender is suitable for the treatment; and (iii) the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his or her committing the offence. Section 339(4) of the CPC goes on to provide that a court must not make an MTO if the MTO suitability report states that the appointed psychiatrist is not satisfied with any of the matters listed above. Finally, section 339(9) of the CPC provides that any report made by the appointed psychiatrist is taken to be _final and conclusive_ as to the matters listed above.

26     In the present case, Dr Chan opined that the Accused did not suffer from a mental illness prior to his arrest by the police in September 2019. He maintained this position in his clarificatory report. It is not clear whether Dr Chan is of the opinion that the Accused is _presently_ suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment, which is what the first condition requires. In any event, Dr Chan’s view must mean that the third condition - that the psychiatric condition is one of the contributing factors for the commission of the offence - cannot be satisfied. Further, Dr Chan was unambiguous in stating that the Accused is not a suitable candidate for an MTO. This Court therefore does not have the option of making an MTO.

### Probation

27     I turn then to examine whether a probation order should be made. Under section 5(1) of the POA, a court may, instead of sentencing an offender, make a probation order “if it is expedient to do so”. Despite the breath of this provision, a body of legal principles has developed over time to provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to make a probation order. The relevant principles are as follows.

> (a)     Probation is never granted as of right: _Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 449</span> (at \[2\]).

> (b)     In order for a probation order to be justified, rehabilitation must be shown to be the dominant sentencing principle: _Public Prosecutor v Lim Chee Yin Jordon_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 46</span> (“**_Jordon Lim_**”) (at \[29\]).

> (c)     Where an offender is 21 years and below at the time of conviction, the law takes a presumptive view that rehabilitation is the primary sentencing consideration: _Jordon Lim_ (at \[30\]-\[31\]).

> (d)     For offenders who are not aged 21 or under at the time of conviction, “the law rightly takes the view that rehabilitation would typically _not_ be the operative concern… _unless_ the particular offender concerned happens to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform or there exist other exceptional circumstances”: (_A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> (“**_Karthik_**”) (at \[44\]) (emphasis in original).

> (e)     In assessing whether an offender had demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, a three-limbed framework may be applied: _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 82</span> (“**_Terence Siow_**”) (at \[55\]). The considerations are as follows.

>> (i)       Whether the offender has demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offence.

>> (ii)       Whether there are conditions in the offender’s life that are conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf.

>> (iii)       If, after considering the first two limbs, the offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, whether there are reasons to revisit the finding of such a high capacity for reform in light of risk factors presented.

> (f)     Even if an offender demonstrates an extremely strong propensity for reform, the significance of rehabilitation may be displaced by a persistent need for deterrence or even retribution because of the gravity of the offence: _Terence Siow_ (at \[52\]) and _GCO v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 31</span> (“**_GCO_**”) (at \[34\]).

28     There is no question, in the present case, that the Accused was above 21 years of age at the time of conviction and was above 21 years of age at the time of the offences. Hence, the starting point is that rehabilitation would generally _not_ be the operative concern. Whether probation should be ordered in this case turns on whether the Accused has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform and, if so, whether rehabilitation has been displaced as the dominant sentencing principle because of the gravity of the offences involved.

#### A positive desire to change

29     Under the first limb of the _Terence Siow_ framework, the court begins by examining “the offender’s _own_ resolve to change, as gleaned from evidence of his remorse and the trajectory of his rehabilitative progress between the time of offending and sentencing”: _Terence Siow_ (at \[56\]) (emphasis in original). In this regard, some relevant factors to consider include evidence of genuine remorse, steps taken post-offence to leave errant ways behind, compliance with and amenability to rehabilitative measures, any re-offending since offence was committed and whether the index offences were out of character.

30     Insofar as remorse is concerned, the evidence, in my judgment, is mixed. I accept that there is some measure of contrition on the part of the Accused. This can be gleaned from his decision to plead guilty at an early stage as well as his willingness to voluntarily attend counselling sessions with his school and seek consultation with Better Life Psychological Medicine Clinic. That the Accused is, to a degree, remorseful is most apparent from the way he has interacted with his psychologists, Dr Ng and Dr Ang, as well as his probation officer, Ms Farhana. It is apparent from their reports that the Accused has been extremely forthright with them. He disclosed in quite some detail his family background, his psychosexual history and, most significantly, the sexual offences he committed that pre-dated the index offences. I regard the admission of his past conduct to these individuals as a measure of genuine contrition. In _Praveen s/o Krishnan v Public Prosecutor_ \[20188\] 3 SLR 1300, the High Court held (at \[62\]) that “full and frank disclosure of criminal activities _beyond_ the offences for which the offender is presently charged clearly goes towards showing the offender’s repentance” (emphasis in original). It is to the Accused’s credit that he has been candid and honest with those called upon to assess him and this, in my judgment, is a sign of genuine remorse.

31     At the same time, the evidence also suggests that some part of his post-arrest behaviour may have been driven by self-preservation. It must be recalled that the Accused did not admit to his offences immediately after he was caught. In fact, he denied that he was trying to take an upskirt video when approached by the witness and the station staff at Sengkang MRT station. It is also noteworthy that, when he was referred to the police nevertheless but before the police arrived, the Accused apologised to the witness and the station staff for his actions and, in the same breath, asked to be let off. This demonstrated a willingness to pay lip service to repentance if it meant that he did not have to face the full repercussions of his criminal acts. In a statement to the police on 4 September 2019, the Accused continued to deny that he had taken upskirt videos, stating that his intention was to capture the face of an unknown female. It was only after his phone was seized that the Accused came clean with the police on 30 June 2020. This took place more than 9 months after he was caught. By that time, the Accused may well have reckoned that the game was up as the police would have access to the incriminating videos recorded on his phone.

32     Even if one may attribute his early conduct to an instinctive response for self-preservation, the evidence shows that, as late as a few months ago, the Accused was still at least as anxious about the consequences of his actions as he may be with facing up to his crimes squarely. Dr Ang, the MSF psychologist, interviewed the Accused on 12 and 14 April 2022. In his report, Dr Ang noted that there were instances of possible impression management when the Accused interacted with him. In assessing the Accused, Dr Ang administered the Paulhaus Deception Scales (“**PDS**”), a self-report instrument that measures an individual’s tendency to give socially desirable responses. The Accused recorded ‘very much above average’ scores on the PDS, suggesting that the Accused may have been trying to tailor his responses to some degree according to what he perceived would be most favourable to him. In fact, the Accused expressly asked Dr Ang about what this Court would look out for on a few occasions. All of this is, of course, not unusual and was not beyond the bounds of what would allow Dr Ang to make a fair and proper assessment but this must be considered in assessing the Accused’s actions post-arrest.

33     The overall picture that emerges is that of an individual who may be remorseful and but is equally driven by the hope of securing a favourable sentencing outcome. This is not unlike the conclusion drawn in _Terence Siow_ where the High Court concluded (at \[68\]) that “any remorse that the Respondent expressed appeared to come in tandem with his fear for the _personal consequences_ of his actions, rather than due to a recognition of the harm that his actions could cause” (emphasis in original).

34     I turn next to consider the steps taken by the Accused post-offence to leave his errant ways behind. In this regard, I am gratified that the Accused appears have made important progress. The starting point is to recall the Accused’s conduct before he was caught. Dr Ng reported that the Accused tried, on a few occasions, to cease taking upskirt videos on his own volition, both when he was in polytechnic and in July 2019, after he completed his national service. During these instances, the Accused reported that he was unable to stop taking upskirt videos for more than 2 weeks. This is indicative of someone who was struggling to cope with his voyeuristic tendencies.

35     After being caught, the Accused attended counselling sessions with his current school, Singapore Management University (“**SMU**”). From Ms Farhana’s report, it appears that the counselling dealt with “stress management, strategies on relaxation and time management and concepts related to acceptance, courage, letting go and moving on”. The Accused also voluntarily sought psychological treatment with Dr Ng. The Accused informed Dr Ang that he had attended 16 sessions with Dr Ng and 23 counselling sessions with his school.

36     As I mentioned earlier, the motivation behind these steps must be viewed with some circumspection given that they were taken after the Accused had been caught. What cannot be gainsaid, however, is the progress the Accused has made, whatever may have been the impetus for change. The Accused’s improvement can be seen by a comparing Dr Ng’s report with Dr Ang’s report. Dr Ng’s report was provided on 11 January 2021, at an early stage of the Accused’s psychological treatment. In that report, Dr Ng stated that the Accused, despite his effort to reflect on the reasons for his behaviour, “presented with somewhat limited insight regarding the motivations that underlie his offending behaviours”. After more than one year of psychological treatment, Dr Ang, whose report was dated 4 May 2022, was able to conclude as follows:

> During this interview, Kiat Chong reflected insight into his risk factors (e.g., his sexual interest in upskirt videos and sexual preoccupation) and was able to narrate the various warning signs (i.e., boredom, increased viewing of pornography to cope with his boredom, and sexual fantasies). He articulated several management strategies such as keeping himself gainfully occupied through other interests (e.g., exercising, attending cell group, and focusing on his photography) to cope with boredom, decreasing his amount of time on pornography to once every fortnightly, and watching only adult consensual heterosexual pornography at this juncture. No sexual preoccupation, sexualised coping and deviant sexual interest were elicited at the point of this interview.

37     The Accused’s rehabilitation is by no means complete. But what is evident is the fact that the Accused has come some way from the individual who took upskirt videos regularly and who could not abstain from doing so for more than two weeks.

38     I turn now to address the Accused’s consumption of pornography. As was the case in _Terence Siow_ (see paragraphs \[70\]-\[72\]), this is an important factor in considering the Accused’s resolve to change for the better. This is because, among other factors, his consumption of pornography led to sexualised coping and sexual preoccupation and, ultimately, predisposed him to sexual offending. In the probation report, Ms Farhana identified his “chronic exposure to deviant pornographic materials” as a risk factor because it fostered his sexual interest and preoccupation in voyeurism. She noted that “his triggers to commit the offence intensified after viewing pornography, including voyeurism videos.” Similarly, Dr Ng reported that the Accused’s “exposure to pornography… resulted in his use of sexual activities as a way of coping with his low mood and loneliness.” Dr Ang concurred. In his view, the Accused’s “unregulated pornography use had heightened his sexual curiosity” and ultimately led to sexual preoccupation and sexual offending.

39     In this regard, Ms Farhana reported that the Accused was first exposed to pornography in 2008 at the age of 12. He continued to watch pornography, including upskirt videos, in lower secondary school. The Accused’s consumption of pornography escalated from end-2014 to mid-2019 where he would watch pornography three times a week and at least one hour in his room during each occasion to satisfy his sexual urges. Significantly, the Accused has not ceased watching pornography completely even at this stage. He informed Dr Ang that he has decreased his pornography consumption to once every fortnight and to “watching only adult consensual heterosexual pornography at this juncture”. Ms Farhana’s report stated the same. It is, of course, important to bear in mind that this information is self-reported and must be considered in that light. Nevertheless, even if we take the Accused’s word at face value, this, at the highest, suggests _some_ measure of change but not full and complete resolve to address a trigger that made him susceptible to sexual offending. It is for that reason that Ms Farhana recommended that, if a probation order is made, an important area of intervention would be to help the Accused develop strategies to manage his sexual pre-occupation and to explore with him healthy ways to manage stressors.

40     There is no evidence that the Accused has re-offended since he was caught on 4 September 2019. This is a period of almost 3 years. This is shorter than was the case in _Karthik_ where there was an intervening period of 5 years. Nevertheless, a period of 3 years, in my judgment, is not short (and is twice the period in _Terence Siow_) and this should be given due weight, especially in view of the steps that the Accused has taken to further his rehabilitation during this time.

41     Finally, I am mindful that the index offences cannot be considered to be out of character on any view. The Defence went to great lengths to present the Accused as someone who has participated in community activities and had done fairly well academically as well as during national service. I do not deny these contributions and personal accomplishments. However, such conduct is relevant for the purposes of sentencing “if it fairly allows the court to infer that the offender’s actions in committing the offence was “out of character”, and that he is therefore _unlikely to re-offend_”: _Terence Siow_ (at \[56(e)\]) (emphasis in original). In this case, it is beyond peradventure that the Accused’s taking of an upskirt video on 4 September 2019 was _not_ out of character. The charge itself alleges that the Accused took upskirt videos on 19 occasions from 28 May 2019 to 4 September 2019. The Accused also admitted to his psychologists and probation officer that his offending actually took place far earlier – it started as early as 2010 when he was in secondary school and continued when he was in ITE and polytechnic. It was therefore very much within the Accused’s character to take upskirt videos. Dr Ang also assessed the Accused’s risk of reoffending to be moderate-high.

42     Taken holistically, the Accused’s desire to change may be summarised as follows:

> (a)     The Accused’s offending was chronic, serious and not aberrant. He had difficulty exercising even a minimal amount of self-control and personal discipline.

> (b)     There is _some_ evidence of remorse and this is the first step on his path of rehabilitation. He pleaded guilty and disclosed, to his psychologists and probation officer, his wider struggles with pornography, sexual preoccupation and sexual offending beyond the index offences. On the other hand, there is also some evidence that the Accused’s post-offence conduct may be partly driven by his desire to receive a favourable sentence.

> (c)     The Accused has made important progress in his rehabilitation up to this point, largely as a result of his own efforts. He has attended multiple sessions for psychological treatment and counselling and is now able to demonstrate some insight into his risk factors and articulate management strategies.

> (d)     The Accused recognises that his consumption of pornography and sexual preoccupation plays a role in his sexual offending. It is for that reason that he has reduced his pornography consumption. However, the fact that he has not ceased watching pornography completely suggests that there may be a limit to his personal resolve to change.

> (e)     The Accused has not re-offended for almost 3 years. This ought to be given due weight.

43     In light of the above, I consider the Accused as having demonstrated a fair amount of resolve to change. Even so, I cannot say with absolute conviction that, on the basis of his desire to change alone, the sentencing principle of deterrence has been displaced.

#### Environmental factors

44     The next step is to consider whether the Accused’s environment provides conditions that are conducive in helping him rehabilitate. The relevant considerations, among other things, are the strength of his familial support, the availability of an external support system and the availability of positive avenues to channel his energy and time.

45     I first address the avenues for the Accused to channel his energy and time. This is especially important in the present case as one of the reasons for his sexual offending is that he did not engage in healthy activities that could have met his emotional and sexual needs. Instead, he turned to deviant sexual activities as a maladaptive way of coping with boredom and regulating his emotions. In this regard, I am mindful that the Accused has a strong desire to further his education. He is currently in the midst of pursuing a degree in Information Systems with SMU, although he has taken a leave of absence to deal with the current legal proceedings. I am gratified by this and encourage the Accused to continue pursuing his interest in further education, regardless of the outcome of this case. For the purpose of sentencing, however, the fact that he is actively engaged in school is not a significant factor. This is because the Accused was also actively engaged in ITE and polytechnic when he took numerous upskirt videos by his own admission. In short, his involvement in school was not sufficient and is unlikely to be sufficient in and of itself to keep the Accused from sexual offending.

46     When being interviewed by Dr Ang, the Accused reported that he had other ways to cope with boredom, namely, exercising, attending cell group and focusing on his photography. He informed Dr Ang that he had been attending cell group sessions for almost a year in order to expand his social circle and to engage in meaningful activities. Even so, Ms Farhana appears to be of the view these are insufficient. She expressly stated two areas of concern as being a “\[l\]ack of positive social connections” and “\[n\]ot engaged in any structured activities in the community”. Her case management plan, if probation were to be ordered, included supporting the Accused in expanding his social network, setting and working towards goals and exploring positive leisure activities of the Accused’s interest. All in all, it appears that there is room for improvement in this area.

47     Insofar as family support is concerned, I am mindful that the Accused’s relationship with his mother was affected, to a significant degree, by minimal interaction time. Because the Accused’s mother was often busy at work, she was not able to exercise close personal supervision over the Accused, which led to the Accused having the opportunity to consume pornography when he was relatively young. There is no doubt that the Accused’s mother is deeply concerned for the Accused. It also appears that the mother-son relationship has improved post-offence as they now take time to have meals, bond over outings and attend weekly mass. Nevertheless, without discounting the best intentions of the Accused’s mother, it is also evident to me that the Accused’s mother can only assist in a limited way. For example, the Accused’s mother indicated to Ms Farhana that she would, since September 2019, carry out random checks at least once a month on the Accused’s handphone to ensure that he was not browsing pornography or deviant content. Despite her best efforts, it appears that the Accused continues to consume pornography. As the High Court observed in _Terence Siow_ (at \[79\]), “\[t\]his is unsurprising, given that the Respondent’s behaviour in this regard occurs in the most private of circumstances, and parental intervention and supervision is likely not feasible”.

48     The same may be said of the Accused’s brothers. I understand that the siblings presently share a warm relationship. However, it does not appear that the Accused’s brothers intervene in the Accused’s life to such a degree that would ensure his rehabilitation. Their relationship appears to be characterised by the giving of advice and providing support if the Accused reached out to them. There is nothing wrong or, indeed, abnormal with such a relationship. However, one cannot conclude that the presence of the brothers’ support forms a strong consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

49     Insofar as external support systems are concerned, the Accused, as mentioned earlier, has few platonic friends and certainly not anyone with whom the Accused would share his deepest concerns with. The Accused does have a girlfriend, with whom he entered a romantic relationship in mid-2021. It appears that his girlfriend is aware of his struggles with sexual offending and supports him in his rehabilitation. Beyond that, however, there is no other information to suggest that this romantic relationship is an important factor for consideration.

50     Taken in the round, the Accused does enjoy support from his family and his girlfriend. However, without belittling the affection they feel for the Accused, the support provided is relatively unremarkable and they are able to assist only to a degree. I assess the Accused’s external environment as being somewhat conducive in helping him rehabilitate but not overwhelmingly so. This is partly a function of the nature of the issues involved. Ultimately, the Accused faces deeply personal demons that he must himself face and, hopefully, conquer.

#### Risk factors

51     In light of the above analysis, there is certainly some propensity for reform. However, I am unable to conclude that the Accused has demonstrated an _extremely strong_ propensity for reform. When taken together with the fact that Dr Ang has assessed the Accused’s risk of sexual offending to be moderate to high, I am not of the view that the primacy of the principle of deterrence has been displaced.

52     As stated above (see para \[16\]), Dr Ang concluded that the Accused has a moderate to high risk of reoffending after considering various favourable and unfavourable factors. While Dr Ang stated that “there was no further information to suggest an imminent risk of sexual recidivism at this juncture”, he also opined that the Accused would likely commit similar offences “when he faces difficulties in managing his sexual urges and perceives an opportunity to offend”. Significantly, given that the Accused committed his offences in public places against ordinary young female adults, it is almost impossible to eliminate opportunities for the Accused to reoffend. Similarly, only the Accused would know if he were facing difficulties managing his sexual urges at any time and, if he does not disclose such difficulties to anyone, it is difficult for anybody to prevent him from re-offending.

53     In sum, therefore, it is not my judgment that the Accused has an extremely strong propensity for reform and, in any event, the moderate to high risk of the Accused reoffending further militates against the making of a probation order.

#### Gravity of the offences

54     Next, I turn to address the gravity of the offences. It is an established principle of law that “even where rehabilitation is relevant as a sentencing principle, it is likely to be trumped by the need for deterrence in cases where the offence concerned is serious”: _Jordon Lim_ (at \[35\]). In my judgment, even if I am wrong about the Accused not having an extremely strong propensity for reform, the circumstances of the offences committed by the Accused provides an independent reason not to order probation.

55     In this regard, the Prosecution referred to the “Annual Crime Brief 2021” prepared by the Singapore Police Force. It stated that voyeurism cases increased from 394 cases in 2020 to 467 cases in 2021. That there has been an increase in the number of such cases was also noted by Parliament during the second reading of the Criminal Law Reform Bill on 6 May 2019 which led, among other things, to the doubling of the prescribed punishment for such offences (at \[6\], above). Indeed, the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr K Shanmugam, remarked that “technology has facilitated the commission of sexual offences such as voyeurism, “cyber-flashing”, distribution of intimate images (often referred to as “revenge pornography”). **And there has been an increase in such cases**”: _Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (6 May 2019) vol 94 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs) (emphasis added).

56     The increasing prevalence of such offences suggests that public interest and deterrence must be at the forefront of sentencing considerations. Indeed, this point was considered in _Ang Zhu Ci Joshua v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1059</span> (“**_Joshua Ang_**”) which involved an offender who was charged with 127 counts of filming or attempting to film upskirt videos and whom the High Court accepted had been fully rehabilitated. Even so, the High Court held (at \[5\]) that “\[w\]hile I accept that the Appellant has indeed been rehabilitated in the sense that he has little or no risk of reoffending, I do not think that probation is an appropriate sentence. For an offence such as this, public interest and deterrence must be accorded due weight.” Of course, in coming to this decision, the High Court also considered the aggravating factors specific to that case. It is to this topic that I now turn my attention.

57     There are three main aggravating factors specific to the present case that furthers the point that deterrence should remain the prevailing sentencing principle. First, the Accused used his mobile phone to facilitate the commission of his offences. The use of technology to commit voyeurism offences requires a deterrent sentence because it enables such offences to be committed easily, makes detection more difficult and increases the potential for great harm _via_ the dissemination of such videos on the internet. The High Court in _Chong Hou En_ made this point (at \[65\]) in no uncertain terms as follows:

> … I am in agreement that general deterrence is particularly relevant. Given the fact that mobile phones with camera functions are now ubiquitous and that cameras with recording functions come in all shapes, sizes and disguises and are getting cheaper to acquire, the perverse now find it easier to prey on unsuspecting women almost anywhere… The miniaturisation of cameras has made it increasingly easier for them to be concealed and harder for victims to detect, thereby encouraging voyeurs to take more risks. This may in part explain why voyeurism offences are rapidly on the rise. In addition, the ease with which videos can be uploaded onto the Internet for dissemination in this day and age further warrants the need for general deterrence. Unimaginable shame and distress to the victims may be caused if the videos are disseminated worldwide via the Internet… I am in full agreement that a strong message should be sent to those who harbour thoughts of abusing these advancements in technology.

58     Secondly, the Accused committed his offences in public places and facilities. Of the 19 upskirt videos that were the subject of the proceeded charge, 17 were recorded on escalators in public places, one was recorded on an MRT train and one was recorded in a retail shop. Generally, general deterrence is important where offences are committed in public or widely used facilities: see _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“**_Law Aik Meng_**”) (at \[24(d)\]). It is important that the public feels safe and protected when using such public facilities. In this connection, the High Court in _Terence Siow_ observed (at \[88\]) that there is a growing need for deterrence where offences are committed on the public transport network “because the public transport network is used by the vast majority of persons in Singapore each and every day; it is a matter of immense importance that they are able to do so feeling safe.”

59     Finally, the breadth and depth of the Accused’s offending also demands that deterrence remains the primary sentencing consideration. In relation to the proceeded charge alone, the Accused recorded 19 upskirt videos between 28 May 2019 and 4 September 2019. The Prosecution pointed out that this works out to an average of 1 upskirt video recorded every 5 to 6 days. I have already pointed out how the Accused’s conduct during this period was not aberrant. The Accused has a history of taking upskirt videos, starting from 2010. In the final analysis, the Accused is facing longstanding, deep-seated issues which require time to resolve.

60     Hence, in the present case, deterrence remains the most significant sentencing principle. The gravity of the offences committed requires that this be so.

### Conclusion

61     For all the reasons canvassed above, it is not, in my judgment, appropriate to make an order of probation in the present case. I am aware that in coming to this conclusion, I have departed from Ms Farhana’s recommendation that the Accused be placed on 18 months supervised probation. However, as stated in the High Court case of _Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 671</span> (at \[16\]), a probation officer’s recommendation is of marginal significance if the key sentencing consideration is something other than rehabilitation. This is so in the present case.

## Issue 2: The appropriate sentence

62     Having ruled out the making of an MTO and a probation order, I turn to consider the appropriate sentence that should be imposed. It does not appear that a sentencing framework has been established in relation to offences under section 509 of the Penal Code. Further, the High Court in _Chong Hou En_ eschewed (at \[77\]) the establishment of a custodial benchmark for such cases. In the circumstances, I will first consider the relevant sentencing considerations for the present case before highlighting precedent cases to outline broadly the spectrum of sentences that have been imposed in similar cases.

### Sentencing considerations

63     In terms of the harm caused by the Accused’s offending, it is material that there were 19 separate incidents of upskirt videos being taken, presumably against multiple victims. It matters not that these victims may not have been aware of the taking of the videos; it is entirely possible to cause harm to an individual without that individual recognising it and such harm should not be discounted altogether. The harm occasioned is, however, not just to the victims alone. In _Law Aik Meng_, the High Court held (at \[25(c)\] that “\[c\]ertain crimes, in addition to harming their immediate victims, also have the wider-felt impact of triggering unease and offending the sensibilities of the general public.” In my judgment, the crimes in question fall within this category as they undermine the social mores of society. There is, therefore, a very real societal cost to the Accused’s actions that is often all too easily ignored.

64     The Defence suggested that the Accused’s offending was spontaneous. I cannot agree. In my view, two factors demonstrate the strength of the Accused’s commitment to offending. First, the intensity of the offending. The accused recorded 19 upskirt videos in the course of 100 days, which is no small amount. Second, the Statement of Facts establishes that the same manner of offending was repeated time and again. The Accused would chance upon women wearing skirts or dresses, follow behind them and then position his mobile phone to take videos of them from beneath their skirts or dresses without their knowledge. Taken holistically, these factors suggest that this is not a case where the Accused momentarily gave in to temptation. This may (or may not) have been the case in the first few instances but it would require a certain level of commitment for someone to repeat the same crime in almost the same way 19 times.

65     In my analysis of whether a probation order should be made, I have earlier identified several other applicable aggravating and mitigating factors. I summarise them here. Insofar as aggravating factors are concerned, it is relevant that the Accused misused technology to commit his offences (at \[57\]), above) and that he committed his offences in public places and facilities (at \[58\], above). In relation to mitigatory factors, I accept that there is a certain degree of genuine remorse (at \[30\] to \[33\]). Some mitigating weight should also be accorded to the fact that the Accused has chosen to plead guilty, thus obviating the need for a trial, although such weight must of course be attenuated by the fact that the evidence against the Accused is very strong indeed.

66     For completeness, I should address a point made by Dr Ng, who was appointed by the Defence. Essentially, Dr Ng opined that the Accused’s voyeuristic disorder played a contributory role in his offences as the compulsive nature of the disorder “would have moderately compromised on his ability to refrain from acting on his voyeuristic urges”. I am mindful that there is a disagreement of expert opinions on whether the Accused suffered from voyeurism disorder (see \[21\], above). In any event, it is important to understand that Dr Ng’s opinion, even if correct, is not the same as suggesting that the Accused was unable to control himself and stop himself from offending, which is the key question for the purposes of sentencing. In _Joshua Ang_, the High Court made this point (at \[3\]) as follows.

> In determining the mitigating value to be attributed to an offender’s mental condition, the key question is whether the nature of the mental condition is such that the individual retains substantially the mental ability or capacity to control or refrain himself when he commits the criminal acts. If the individual’s ability to refrain himself is not impaired, and he instead chooses not to exercise his self-control, then the presence of the mental condition will be given little or no mitigating value….

67     There is no suggestion, in the present case, that the Accused was unable to control himself. Indeed, the general nature of voyeurism was the subject of intense cross-examination and expert submissions in _Chong Hou En_. Ultimately, the High Court concluded (at \[61\]) that “voyeurism is merely a clinical description of what is essentially a perverse behaviour option and that it does not deprive a person of his self-control in the way that an impulse control disorder does.” This position was followed in _GCO_ (at \[39\]). Thus, even if the Accused suffered from voyeurism disorder, this fact did not mean that he was unable to control himself and refrain from sexual offending. The Accused’s voyeurism disorder therefore does not carry significant mitigatory weight.

68     Finally, this is not a case where the Accused’s lack of antecedents should be treated as carrying mitigatory weight. Although there is only a single charge, the charge alleges that the Accused has committed 19 instances of taking upskirt videos. Further, the Accused also admitted that his sexual offending started prior to the index offences. The Accused should not be treated as a first-time offender. Indeed, the High Court in _Chen Weixiong, Jerriek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 103</span> held (at \[15\]) that “\[t\]he only reason the appellant had no prior convictions was because the law had not yet caught up with him for his past misdeeds.” That sentiment applies with equal force to this case.

###    Precedents

69     I have considered all the precedents cited by the Prosecution and the Defence (at \[9\] and \[11\], above). Given the number, I do not propose to go through all of them. Instead, I will focus on the five that I found most useful, as follows:

> (a)     The first case is that of _Chong Hou En_. In that case, the offender pleaded guilty to five counts of voyeurism and one count of possessing 10,574 obscene films. Another 11 similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender was caught at a shopping mall with a mini-camera attached to the tip of his shoe. During the course of investigations, it was revealed that the offender also placed in the toilet of his girlfriend’s home a digital camera which he would use to film members of his girlfriend’s family showering. In the judgment of the High Court, it was held that the use of technology to commit voyeurism offences was a significant aggravating factor. The Court also noted the high degree of planning and intrusion and the presence of young and multiple victims. Considering that the offender pleaded guilty and demonstrated remorse, a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment was imposed in respect of each of the voyeurism charges. Four weeks’ imprisonment was imposed in respect of the charge for possession of obscene films. An aggregate sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment was handed down.

> (b)     In _Ang Wei Sheng_, the offended pleaded guilty to one charge of voyeurism and one charge of criminal trespass. Two other charges of criminal trespass were taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender was an ex-student of Republic Polytechnic. On 8 November 2015, he entered the female shower room of the polytechnic’s swimming complex, used a towel to conceal his identity and waited for a victim. When the victim entered the shower room to use the facility, the offender proceeded to the cubicle adjacent to the victim’s and used his mobile phone to record a video of the victim showering. The District Court noted that there were several aggravating factors, including the high degree of planning and intrusion and the fact that the offender took steps to evade detection. On the other hand, the Court took into consideration the offender’s plea of guilt and lack of antecedents. The Court imposed 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the voyeurism charge and 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the criminal trespass charge.

> (c)     The offender in _Lee Chee Hoong_ faced four proceeded charges – two counts of voyeurism, one count of attempted voyeurism and one count of criminal trespass. Another five similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. All of these offences were committed in the female toilet of Mountbatten Centre. Generally, the offender would enter the female toilet with the intention of taking compromising photographs of victims. He would do so by squatting outside the cubicle of the victim in question. The Court considered that the offender had committed the offences over five months, that the offences were premeditated and that the offender was a repeat offender. The offender was sentenced to 8 weeks’ imprisonment for the voyeurism charges, 4 weeks’ imprisonment for the attempted voyeurism charge and 2 weeks’ imprisonment for criminal trespass. The global sentence imposed was 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (d)     The following case is most alike the present case in terms of the manner in which the offences was committed. In _Koh Rong Gui_, the offender claimed trial to four charges of voyeurism. Like the Accused, the offender in _Koh Rong Gui_ took voyeuristic videos on the public transportation network and in public places. At the end of the trial, he was convicted of all the charges. The Court considered that the offender did not display any remorse and sentenced the offender to a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment (6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge). The Court expressly stated (at \[67\]) that the Court would have imposed a more severe sentence for each offence had the Prosecution submitted for a more severe sentence.

> (e)     The offender in _Ryan You_ pleaded guilty to two voyeurism charges. Two further charges of criminal trespass were taken into consideration. On two occasions, the offender had entered the female toilet of a residential hall of the National University of Singapore and took photographs of two victims showering. The Court sentenced the offender to 7 weeks’ imprisonment for each charge with the sentences running concurrently. The Court noted that a recording device was used, there was a high degree of intrusion and there were multiple victims.

### Analysis

70     In my view, the sentence for the present case should not be lower than those handed down in _Ang Wei Sheng_, _Lee Chee Hoong_, _Koh Rong Gui_ and _Ryan You_. Although the degree of premeditation may be higher in _Ang Wei Sheng_ and, possibly, _Lee Chee Hoong_, the scale of offending in the present case was on a far higher level than these cases. The present case involves an amalgamated charge comprising 19 different incidents. None of the above cases even approach that number. I am particularly mindful that the aggregate sentence imposed in _Koh Rong Gui_ was 12 weeks’ imprisonment even though there were only _four_ voyeurism offences in that case. Even considering that the offender in _Koh Rong Gui_ claimed trial and did not demonstrate remorse, the aggregate sentence for the present case should not be lower than that of _Koh Rong Gui_, given the wide discrepancy in the number of voyeurism incidents.

71     The only case that may be comparable in scale is that of _Chong Hou En_. Although that case only involved five proceeded voyeurism charges, there were another ten such charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. There were also charges under the Films Act, as there is in the present case. In that case, the Court imposed a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment for each of the charges brought under section 509 of the Penal Code. In doing so, the Court considered a few factors, some of which were similar to those in the present case and some which were different. The similar factors include the fact that there were multiple victims, technology was used to facilitate the offending, the fact that the offender had pleaded guilty and had shown considerable remorse with a keen desire not to commit the offences again and to be fully rehabilitated. The distinguishing factors include the fact that in _Chong Hou En_, the degree of planning was significant and higher than that displayed in the present case. Further, there were young victims involved which is not the case here. In aggregate, the Court ordered that one of the sentences for the voyeurism charges run consecutively with one of the sentences for the charges under the Films Act, yielding a total sentence of 16 weeks’ imprisonment.

72     In my judgment, the conclusion that may be drawn from the above analysis is that the Prosecution’s submission of 10 to 12 weeks’ imprisonment sentence is more than reasonable. The Defence submitted that I should land on the lower end of that range (_i.e._, ten weeks’ imprisonment). However, I consider that a sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment would be more in line with the precedents cited by parties.

## Conclusion

73     Having regard to the foregoing, I sentence the Accused to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

74     As a final word, I have earlier noted that the Accused has taken important steps to secure his own rehabilitation even before being sentenced. I encourage him to continue on this path, both while he is incarcerated and after he is released.
