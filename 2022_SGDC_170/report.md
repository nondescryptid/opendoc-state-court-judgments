Criminal Law – Offences - Corruption

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing – Principles

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9137/2022/01.\]

30 July 2022

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused is a 38-year old male foreign national of the People’s Republic of China. He was represented by counsel and claimed trial to three charges under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”). The charges are for offences of offering $100 to three police officers respectively to induce them not to arrest him for drink driving. He claimed that he was merely trying to pay a fine “on the spot”.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, his defence was rejected and he was convicted of all three charges. He was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment in total. I had provided the parties with my brief reasons for the conviction and indicated that full grounds will be furnished if necessary. The accused, on his own, has filed an appeal against both his conviction and sentence. I now provide my full grounds for the conviction and sentence.

## The Charges

3       For ease of reference, I set out the three charges in full as follows:

> First Charge

> You… are charged that you, on 3 December 2019, sometime between 11.30 p.m. and 11.38 p.m., at the open-air carpark located at Geylang Lorong 31, did corruptly offer gratification to Staff SGT Roslan bin Abdul Rasip, an officer serving under the Singapore Police Force, as an inducement for forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, by waving two $50 notes at him as an inducement for him not to arrest you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 6(b) of the PCA.

> Second Charge

> You…are charged that you, on 3 December 2019, sometime between 11.30 p.m. and 11.38 p.m., at the open-air carpark located at Geylang Lorong 31, did corruptly offer gratification to SGT(3) Muhammad Shakir Lim bin Muhammad Sharizal Lim, an officer serving under the Singapore Police Force, as an inducement for forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, by waving two $50 notes at him as an inducement for him not to arrest you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 6(b) of the PCA.

> Third Charge

> You…are charged that you, on 3 December 2019, at or about 11.45pm., at the open-air carpark located at Geylang Lorong 31, did corruptly offer gratification to ASP Tan Jia Ming, an officer serving under the Singapore Police Force, as an inducement for forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs, to wit, by offering him $100 as an inducement for him not to arrest you, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 6(b) of the PCA.

## Background Facts

4       The following background facts as established by Prosecution’s evidence were not materially disputed. I will summarise the Prosecution’s evidence where material and relevant as set out in the Prosecution’s closing submission.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

5       The offences occurred on 3 December 2019, sometime between 11.30pm and 11.45pm, at the open-air carpark at Geylang Lorong 31 (the “carpark”). It was not in dispute that the accused had consumed alcohol prior to the offences as he was celebrating his impending return to China the following day. He borrowed a car from a friend and was driving or trying to park his car at the carpark. The police were tipped off to a possible case of drink driving and SSgt Roslan bin Abdul Rasip[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) (“SSgt Roslan”) and his partner, Sgt Muhammad Shakir Lim bin Muhammad Sharizal Lim[^3] (“Sgt Shakir”), were despatched to the carpark to investigate. They saw the accused driving the car and stopped their patrol car to question him. The accused took out two $50 notes from his wallet and offered the money first to SSgt Roslan[^4] and shortly after to Sgt Shakir[^5].

6       Since the accused spoke in Mandarin, SSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir enlisted the assistance of a Mandarin speaking colleague, Sgt Lum Zheng Yao[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) (“Sgt Lum”), to speak to the accused on the phone regarding the $100 that the accused appeared to be offering to SSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir.

7       Sgt Lum spoke to the accused in Mandarin using SSgt Roslan’s mobile phone which was switched to loudspeaker mode.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) Sgt Lum testified that the accused said that the $100 was offered to SSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir to “let him off and give him a chance”, and that “if $100 is not enough \[the accused\] can increase it to $150”.[^8]

8       Sgt Lum informed the accused that he would be placed under arrest for bribery.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) The officers then alerted their superior officer, ASP Tan Jia Ming[^10] (“ASP Tan”), who arrived at the scene subsequently. ASP Tan spoke to the accused in Mandarin and the accused also offered him $100. The conversation between ASP Tan and the accused is summarised as follows:[^11]

> (a)     The accused admitted that he had offered money to the officers but that it was a trivial matter and he asked to be let off. ASP Tan told the accused that he had offered a bribe to the police officers, and that it was a serious matter.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

> (b)     The accused then also offered $100 to ASP Tan[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) and said that $100 would not amount to a bribe in China.[^14]

> (c)     ASP Tan told the accused that even 20 cents would be a bribe in Singapore. The accused, however, continued to offer $100 to ASP Tan, saying it was “coffee money”.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

9       ASP Tan testified that he understood the phrase “coffee money” as a bribe to let off the accused.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

10     The accused was placed under arrest and brought back to Bedok Police Division for further investigations. The following statements were recorded from the accused voluntarily, without threat, inducement or promise, and were admitted in evidence:

> (a)     First statement recorded under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) by Principal Special Investigator Jeryl Kong[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) (“IO Jeryl”) on 4 December 2019;[^18]

> (b)     Further statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC by IO Jeryl on 6 February 2020;[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) and

> (c)     Three cautioned statements recorded under s 23 of the CPC by Principal Special Investigator Eugene Teo[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) (“PSI Eugene”) on 11 June 2020 at 12.40pm,[^21] 12.50pm[^22] and 12.55pm[^23] respectively.

The relevant and material portions of the statements will be elaborated below.

11     In essence, it was not in dispute that the accused offered $100 to SSgt Roslan, Sgt Shakir and ASP Tan (collectively “the three officers”). It was also not in dispute that the accused offered $100 to the three officers and asked them to give him a chance and to let him go. The material question was whether the accused intended for the $100 to be a bribe or something else that is entirely lawful.

12     It was also not in dispute that the accused’s alcohol level did not exceed the legal limit, as it turned out subsequently following a breathalyser test at the scene. However, there is no denying that he appeared to be and did drive under the influence of alcohol. It was also not disputed that the accused thought he had committed an offence of drink driving.

## The Defence

13     The accused’s defence is summarised in the Defence’s closing submission as follows.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

14     The accused thought that he was being charged by the police officers for a traffic offence. He thought he could pay a fine there and then to settle the matter. His defence is that the money was not intended to be a bribe to the officers but was meant to be a fine to the Singapore government. He wanted to pay the fine “on the spot.”[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) He did not know that the laws of Singapore did not permit the officers to accept the money from him even as payment of a fine. He did not intend to offer gratification to induce the officers not to arrest him.

15     It is not the accused’s defence, at least not at the trial, that he was so drunk that he did not know what he was doing.

## Verdict

16     The accused was convicted of three charges at the conclusion of the trial.

## The Law

17     The applicable law is not in dispute. As set out in Prosecution’s submission, the elements of an offence under s 6(b) of the PCA are as follows:[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26)

> (a)     the giving or offering of a gratification to a person;

> (b)     to induce the person to forebear to do an act in relation to his principal’s affairs;

> (c)     there was an objective corrupt element in the transaction; and

> (d)     the accused offered the gratification with the requisite guilty knowledge (i.e. that he knew or realised that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard).

The first element relates to the _actus reus_ of the offence and the remaining three elements concern the _mens rea_ of the offence.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27)

18     In the present case, the _actus reus_ was not disputed in that the accused did not deny that he had offered $100 to the three officers. The only dispute pertained to whether he had the requisite his _mens rea_. Even then, there was no real dispute as to the second element i.e. the money was offered to induce or persuade the three officers not arrest him, which would clearly be act or forbearance to do an act in relation to their principal’s (the Singapore Police Force) affairs. The Prosecution’s case was that the money was offered by the accused as a bribe to corruptly induce the officers not to arrest him for a drink driving offence which he may have committed. On the other hand, the accused’s defence was that he was simply trying to legally pay a fine there and then to the officers. The material dispute therefore pertained to the third and fourth elements. The parties proceeded on the basis that if the money was indeed intended to be a bribe and not an “on the spot” fine, then the third and fourth elements would also be satisfied in that the offer of the money would be objectively corrupt and that the accused knew it to be so. If these two elements are also satisfied, the accused would have committed the offences.

## Reasons for Conviction

19     I found that all the elements of the charges against the accused have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. These are my findings and reasons.

20     I heard and believed the evidence of the police officers, including the three officers, who testified in court. In summary, their testimonies were that the accused first offered $100 to SSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir. Sgt Lum then conversed with the accused on the phone in Mandarin and the accused confirmed that the $100 was meant for SSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir. Thereafter, ASP Tan arrived at the scene and the accused also repeatedly offered $100 to him.

21     I did not find that the police officers were biased in any way as alleged by the Defence. I found that they were entirely objective and professional in their interactions with the accused. The accused admitted as much that he had offered money to the three officers.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) The evidence as to the material and core facts are not disputed i.e. that the accused offered the money to the three officers and asked them to be lenient to him and to let him go.

#### Accused’s conduct shows corrupt intent

22     The accused acknowledged that he had consumed alcohol prior to driving the car.[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) He in fact thought that he was guilty of and would be charged for drink driving. He also stressed that he was in a hurry to return to China the following day and that his family members were anticipating his return.[^30] Quite apart from avoiding criminal prosecution, I found that he had an additional and compelling reason and motive to avoid being arrested that evening because he did not wish to jeopardise his return to China the following day.

23     The accused admitted that he offered the money to SSgt Roslan and Sgt Shakir respectively and asked to be given a chance and also to be let off. In essence, he was asking them (and also ASP Tan subsequently) not to arrest him. The accused’s statements confirmed as much. It was not in dispute that none of the officers accepted the offer and that the accused was ultimately placed under arrest. What is very telling is that he offered the gratification even before there was any mention that he had committed an offence. In fact, the accused offered the money to SSgt Roslan immediately after handing over his identification document. I also accepted the officers’ evidence that the money was offered to them even before administering the breathalyser test on the accused. The accused would not be able to dispute this because he was unable to recall when the breathalyser was administered.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31)

24     There was certainly no suggestion by the Defence that the officers had asked the accused to pay a fine or even to compound any offence. Therefore, there would have been no reason or objective basis for the accused to offer to pay any composition or fine to any of the officers. Considering these circumstances, the reality was that the accused had offered them money to induce them to let him go and not take further investigative or enforcement action against him. There was no possibility that the accused could have intended the $100 to pay a fine.

#### Fine could not have been indeterminate

25     The accused also told Sgt Lum that that “if $100 is not enough \[the accused\] can increase it to $150”.[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) He spoke normally with no slurred speech and appeared to be sober.[^33] When cross-examined as to how he came up with the amount of fine to be paid, the accused said it was just an estimate.[^34] Given that the amount offered appeared to be variable and indeterminate (and not to mention unsolicited), I found that the accused could not have intended to pay a fine.

#### ‘Fine’ not mentioned to officers

26     I also considered that the accused did not mention the word “fine” even in Mandarin to the Mandarin speaking officers. He would have explained that he was prepared and wanted to pay a fine on the spot if that was indeed his intention. Instead, he asked the officers to “give me a chance” and “let me go”. His conversation with ASP Tan was even more incriminating. When ASP Tan told the accused that it amounted to a bribe however small the amount, instead of explaining that the money was to pay a fine, he told ASP Tan that the $100 was “coffee money”.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) I believed ASP Tan’s evidence. This was the clearest indication that the payment was not a fine as the term “coffee money” is commonly understood to be a bribe. Without a doubt, the accused meant to bribe the officers by describing the payment as “coffee money”.

#### Irrelevant that ‘bribe’ not mentioned

27     I further considered that notwithstanding that the word ‘bribe’ was not uttered, the accused’s offer of money coupled with a plea to be given a chance and to be let off is more consonant with a bribe being offered to the officers not to arrest him and therefore must be construed and intended as such.

28     I also considered that the accused’s alcohol level may not have exceeded the legal limit (as it turned out subsequently) but there was no denying that he appeared to be and did drive under the influence of alcohol. Accordingly, the officers were acting within their legal powers to question and investigate the accused and even arrest him on suspicion of drink driving. The Defence’s submission that the accused had not committed an offence of drink driving is both misconceived and irrelevant. There is no need to invoke the presumption under s 9(2) of the PCA regarding public servants acting outside the scope of their duties or powers.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) In any event, I agree entirely with the Prosecution’s submission that even if the accused did not in fact or in law commit an offence of drink driving, this was irrelevant because his intention was to bribe the officers to induce them to cease taking further action against him and to avoid a possible arrest.[^37]

#### Admissions in accused’s statements

29     The accused as good as admitted in his long statement (P6) that the money was indeed a bribe when he stated the following:[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

> I wish to state that I wanted Officer B \[i.e. SSgt Roslan\] to _keep the $100 in return for letting me go and to not arrest me_. I also do not know if Officer B knew what I was saying as I spoke in Mandarin. I wish to state that _I knew it was illegal to drink and drive in Singapore and therefore offered $100 to Officer B to not arrest me_.

> \[emphasis added\]

30     The accused further admitted that he was aware that bribery is an offence and he should not have offered the $100 to the officers:[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39)

> … I wish to state that _I am aware bribery in Singapore is an offence, regardless of the amount. I knew it was wrong to have offered $100 to the Officer A and B_ \[i.e. Sgt Shakir and SSgt Roslan\] _in return for them to not arrest me and let me go_. At the point of time, _I was hoping that the Officers would accept my money and let me go as I was afraid they would arrest me for Drink Driving_. I regret my actions and promise to not do it again.

> \[emphasis added\]

31     Given the context of what the accused said and admitted in his statement as set out above, I found that he had the corrupt intent to bribe the officers and he knew it was illegal to do so.

#### ‘Fine’ also not mentioned in statements

32     I further considered that the accused failed to mention in his long statement (P6), that he had intended to pay a fine. I found that the recorder (IO Jeryl) had faithfully and accurately recorded the accused’s statement and had not left out anything material to the accused’s defence. I agree with Prosecution’s submission that just because certain minor and immaterial details were not recorded (e.g. the type of alcohol that the accused consumed and that the accused was going to return to China a few days after the incident) did not render the statement any less reliable.[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) It was also not in dispute that the statement was read back to the accused and he did not request to add his defence of wanting to pay a fine to the statement. I therefore accord full weight to the statement.

33     In any event, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, the Defence’s position was not that the recorder had left out the accused’s defence intentionally or otherwise, but that the accused had meant to (but did not) say that he had intended to pay a fine.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) This came across quite clearly from counsel’s cross-examination of the recorder as follows:[^42]

> Q    Okay. So, he did not---he did not articulate or explain this further. Besides, whatever is written here, he did not say anything more.

> A    Yes.

> Q    Okay, alright. But these are my client’s instructions _on what he had meant to say_.

> A    Yah, because like I mentioned, it’s verbatim, so it’s actually what he said is all here.

> \[emphasis added\]

34     Therefore, while the accused allegedly meant to tell the recorder that he had intended to pay a fine, he did _not_ in fact do so. The accused also readily and repeatedly conceded when cross-examined that he failed to mention this claim in his statement:[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43)

> Q    Okay, so when you say “show some leniency”, you are now saying it’s to ask them to lower the amount of the fine, is it?

> A    Yes.

> Q    Yes. Then why didn’t you say this in your statement? Okay, maybe let’s take it one step back. You didn’t say this in your statement, right?

> A    I did not say this.

> …

> Q    Yes, and you did---and you therefore did not say “let me pay the fine, help me lower the amount of the fine”. You did not say this in your statement?

> A    That’s right, I did not say this.

35     At the end of the day, I found that there was no omission on the part of the recorder, intentionally or otherwise, to record the accused’s claim that he intended to pay a fine. The accused did not say so and I found that he did not say so simply because he never intended to pay any fine.

36     The accused also failed to mention in all three cautioned statements[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) recorded by PSI Eugene, that the $100 was meant to be a fine. This omission further cements the Prosecution’s case that the accused had never intended the $100 as payment for a fine. In effect, the accused failed to state his defence in his cautioned statements even though he was warned of the legal consequence that his defence (if not stated) will less likely be believed by the court.

## Defence Rejected

37     I disbelieved the accused and rejected his defence that the money was intended as payment of a fine. It was not disputed that the officers did not ask him to pay any fine. There was absolutely no discussion of payment of any fine let alone the quantum of the fine to be paid, if any. I found that there were no objective circumstances to lead the accused to either subjectively or voluntarily offer to pay a fine.

38     As highlighted above, the accused did not tell the officers that the money was meant as a fine to be paid to the Singapore government. He did not say this to Sgt Lum who had spoken to him on the phone or to ASP Tan who arrived at the scene thereafter and who also spoke to him. He also did not mention this claim to the recorder in his statements. I found that the failure and omission could not have been due to any miscommunication or misunderstanding because these are all Mandarin speaking officers.

39     The money was offered to the officers in their personal capacity. He said that the money was for ‘them’ or for their “colleagues”. Clearly, the accused did not and could not have meant that the money was to be paid to the Singapore government. It is also telling that the accused offered the money before the breathalyser test was conducted. He offered the money and asked the officers to give him a chance and to let him go. In other words, the money offered was a bribe to persuade the officers to let him off without them taking any further investigative step or enforcement act against him. This runs counter to his assertion that he believed he would be paying a fine to the Singapore government.

40     I also found that his explanation that $100 is a small amount which cannot be intended as a bribe, was simply his attempt to trivialise the matter in order to induce the officers to let him off. I found that he intended to bribe the officers with that amount, thinking and hoping that $100 was sufficient. He was even prepared to increase the amount of bribe to $150. In short, I found that the accused offered the money as a bribe to the officers not to arrest him i.e. to forbear to do an act in relation to their principal’s affairs.

41     As highlighted earlier, the accused failed to state his defence in his cautioned statements. On the contrary, he stated a different defence in P3 (concerning the charge of bribing SSgt Roslan) that:[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45)

> I wish to say that as I had a couple of alcoholic beverages and medication, I did not know what I was doing. I then came to realise it was wrong when I knew he was a policeman of the Singapore police force.

42     I noted that this defence was not pursued at trial and was replaced by the defence that he meant to pay a fine. No explanation was offered as to why there was a change in the accused’s defence. This change in position is yet another dent in the accused’s credibility and a further ground for disbelieving his defence.

#### Accused’s conduct not counter-intuitive to bribery

43     I disagree with Defence’s submission that the accused’s actions were counter-intuitive for someone intending to bribe the officers. The Defence highlighted the following three actions of the accused:

> (a)     That he would not have given his identity card to the officers before offering the money;[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46)

> (b)     That he never used the word “bribe”;[\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47) and

> (c)     That he continued to offer the money even after being told that what he was doing amounted to a bribe.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

44     I agree with the Prosecution’s submission that the above actions were not inconsistent with an intention to bribe the officers and were therefore not counter-intuitive with bribery.

45     The accused’s act of handing over his identity card to the officers was not indicative that he had no intention to bribe the officers. Even if he did not initially form the intention to bribe the officers when he handed over his identification document, he most certainly intended to bribe them when he offered the money to the officers. In any case and given the circumstances, he knew he was in no position to hide his identity from the officers. If he did not hand over his identification document, he knew he would get into even more trouble with them and it would be harder to bribe his way out of his predicament.

46     Next, the Defence stressed that the accused never used the word bribe. However, I found that the fact that the accused did not expressly utter the word “bribe” in Mandarin to the Mandarin speaking officers did not negate an intention on the part of the accused to bribe the officers. Further, the fact that the officers did not clarify with the accused if he wanted to bribe them did not equate to the fact that the accused did not offer them a bribe. As I have stated earlier in these grounds, even though the word ‘bribe’ was not used by the accused, his offer of money coupled with a plea to be given a chance and to be let off is more consonant with a bribe being offered to the officers not to arrest him and must be construed and intended as such.

47     If the Defence wished to argue the point that the accused did not expressly say he wanted to bribe the officers, the converse argument may also be made that the accused did not mention that he wanted to pay a fine in his interactions with the officers or in any of his statements. With regards to his statements, I have already rejected any suggestion that the recorder may not have fully recorded what the accused had to say. I would further add that while an accused would understandably be coy and careful about openly calling a payment to be a bribe, the sentiment would not be the same if the payment was indeed intended to be a composition fine. In other words, if the payment was intended to be a legitimate payment of a fine, the accused would have expressly said so. I therefore found that the fact that the word “bribe” was not mentioned was neither here nor there. The accused’s claim that he meant to pay a composition fine was unsupported by any evidence and was in fact contradictory to all the evidence. His claim was nothing more than a belated afterthought.

48     On the contrary, the accused pleaded with the officers to “give me a chance” and said that the money was for them to let him go. He also offered to increase the amount of to $150 if it was “not enough”. These phrases were more consistent with a bribe than wanting to pay a composition fine to the government.

49     Finally, I found that the mere fact that the accused continued to offer money to the officers even after being told that it amounted to bribery was also not inconsistent with an intention to bribe the officers. This was because the officers were not tempted and therefore the accused tried to play down his act of bribing (by saying it was only “coffee money”) while at the same time persisting to persuade the officers to accept his bribe so that he would be let off. This would explain why the accused continued to offer the officers money even when told that it constituted bribery. He was merely trying to persuade the officers not to think of it as a bribe even though he intended it and they all understood it to be so.

50     I also rejected the Defence’s argument that the officers should have clarified with the accused why he had offered them money. I found the Defence’s submission to be totally disingenuous that in not clarifying with the accused, the accused did not have the opportunity to tell the officers that the money was meant to be payment of a fine.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49)

51     I found the accused’s intention to bribe to be abundantly clear, given the circumstances. He had consumed alcohol and was driving his car when the officers stopped him. He offered them money and repeatedly asked the officers to give him a chance and to let him go. The officers had not even informed him that he had committed any offence or that he would be arrested and had not yet conducted a breathalyser test on him. The officers did not ask him to pay a fine let alone mention the amount to be paid. Given the context and the circumstances, it did not lie in the mouth of the accused to say that the officers did not clarify with him if the money was meant to be a fine. In fact, the officers (i.e. ASP Tan) did ask the accused if the money was a bribe to which the accused said it was too small an amount to be a bribe and that it was only coffee money. Therefore, contrary to Defence’s submission, the accused had the opportunity to explain to the officers that the money was to be paid to the Singapore government as a fine but he did not do so. Instead, he said it was coffee money, which was the clearest indication (short of calling it a bribe) that it was a bribe.

## Conclusion

52     I believed the testimonies of the all the police officers whose evidence of the circumstances surrounding the offences were not materially in dispute. I found that the accused’s verbal exchanges with the officers (including the three officers), alongside his admissions in his statements, evinced without any doubt that he intended to bribe the three officers to let him off and not arrest him.

53     I rejected the accused’s defence that he was only trying to pay a fine on the spot as nothing more than an afterthought.

54     Having carefully considered all the evidence, I found that the prosecution has proved the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The accused was convicted of all three charges.

## Sentence

55     The Prosecution’s sentencing position was that the accused ought to be sentenced to at least four weeks’ imprisonment per charge, and to run two sentences consecutively making a total sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50)

56     On the other hand, Counsel requested in his oral mitigation that the accused be sentenced to three weeks’ imprisonment per charge, and to run two sentences consecutively making a total sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment i.e. two weeks shorter than Prosecution’s position. The Defence also filed a written mitigation plea on behalf of the accused pleading for leniency and setting out the personal circumstances of the accused.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51)

57     I preferred and accepted Prosecution’s sentencing position. I agree that for corruption offences where the offender bribes a public servant, the norm ought rightly to be a custodial sentence unless there are very exceptional circumstances which would justify a departure from the norm (_PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> at \[15\]). This is especially so in this case where police officers are being bribed.

58     I noted that counsel did not disagree that a custodial sentence was warranted in this case, except that counsel asked for a shorter jail sentence. Even then, it was not by much. However, I considered that the individual and global sentences proposed by the Prosecution were entirely appropriate and justified and also consistent with the precedents tendered by the Prosecution. I agree with the Prosecution that the precedents show that the usual sentence for a first offender pleading guilty to even a single charge is four weeks’ imprisonment.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) An offender who claims trial (such as the present accused) would and should forfeit any sentencing discount which he would otherwise be entitled and therefore would receive a sentence higher than four weeks’ imprisonment. For example, in the reported decision in _PP v Lim Teck Choon_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 577</span>, the offender only pleaded guilty at a very late stage of the trial when he was cross-examined, and he was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment.

59     Likewise, the present accused ought to be sentenced to more than four weeks’ imprisonment per charge. Turning to counsel’s proposed three weeks’ imprisonment per charge, counsel did not cite any precedents in support of the lower sentence. I also did not find any compelling factor in his mitigation to justify a shorter sentence. The accused’s personal circumstances as informed in counsel’s mitigation were entirely unexceptional and do not attenuate the accused’s culpability at all to justify a sentence lower than the norm, especially since the accused did not show any remorse by choosing to contest the charges.

60     In the present case, as there are three charges, the court will have to order the sentences for at least two charges to run consecutively. I agree with the Prosecution that to give effect to the one-transaction rule and the totality principle, a downward revision of the individual sentences to four weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate so that the accused does not receive an unduly harsh sentence. This would also adequately address counsel’s point that the offences were committed “in the same proximity of time” and that the offences were similar in nature.[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53)

61     Ultimately, I considered that the global sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment was condign and not at all not crushing on the accused.
