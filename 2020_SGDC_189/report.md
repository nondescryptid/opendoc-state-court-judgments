\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9762/2020/01.\]

18 August 2020

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused is Ng Soon Weng, male 45 years old. At the relevant time, he was the Director and shareholder of First Tel Tech Pte Ltd (“FTT”). FTT was in the business of providing system integration services, and IT software and hardware products. The Accused was in charge of bringing in sales for FTT.

2       He pleaded guilty to the following charges –

> (a)     17 counts of corruptly giving illegal gratifications to one James Lim Liong Ghee (Lin Longyi) (“Lim”), the IT manager of Dymon Asia Capital (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Dymon”), which were offences under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Cap 241 (“PCA”).

> (b)     Two counts of engaging in a conspiracy with Lim and one Foong Jinhui (“Foong”), to commit forgery for the purposes of cheating Changi Airports International Pte Ltd (“CAI”), which were offences under s 468 read with s 109 of the Penal Code, Cap 224 (“PC”). At the relevant time, Lim was the Associate Director of IT at CAI, and Foong was the Accused’s subordinate at FTT.

## Charges

3       The 17 PCA charges involved corruptly giving illegal gratifications of various amounts to Lim as a reward to Lim for doing acts in relation to his principal affairs, to wit, advancing the business of FTT with Dymon. The amounts of the gratifications in the 17 charges ranged from $3,000 to $22,178.

4       In relation to the two PC charges, Foong had dishonestly executed two quotations dated 14 Nov 2016 and 15 Nov 2016 purportedly made by Dacon Networks Pte Ltd (“Dacon”) and Eztech Services Pte Ltd (“Eztech”) with the intention of causing it to be believed that the quotations were made by Dacon and Eztech respectively. The Accused and the co-conspirators knew that this was not the case. The purpose of executing the forged quotations was to cheat CAI into awarding the procurement of Microsoft WinPro 10 SNGL OLP NL to FTT.

## Facts

### The PCA offences in relation to Dymon

5       Lim started working at Dymon sometime in 2012. Prior to 2012, FTT was already a vendor of Dymo providing Dymon’s telephone system. Lim was one of two staff at Dymon’s IT Department. He was the senior of the two and was responsible for procurement work and representing Dymon when dealing with IT vendors.

6       As and when Dymon required IT-related services or purchases, Lim would undertake an evaluation of at least two vendors before making his recommendation on the vendor most suitable for Dymon’s needs. Lim would forward his recommendation to Mark Wong, Dymon’s Chief Operating Officer. Mark Wong was the authorising officer to approve any particular vendor. However, as a matter of course, Mark Wong would typically approve the single quote presented to him by Lim.

7       Sometime in 2014, the Accused informed Lim that apart from telephone system, FTT could also provide Dymon’s Microsoft licenses. Lim agreed to procure these licenses from FTT in return for commissions from the Accused. Lim and the Accused agreed that Lim would recommend FTT to Mark Wong each time a purchase was necessary, instead of doing what Lim was duty-bound to do, which was to impartially recommend the most ideal vendor to Mark Wong in Dymon’s best interest.

8       From January 2015 to May 2016, the Accused corruptly gave cash gratifications totalling $88,967 to Lim across 22 occasions as rewards for awarding 20 procurement purchases to FTT. The six occasions in relation to the proceeded charges were –

9       The Accused had handed the gratifications in the table above to Lim at the carpark of Millenia Tower where the offices of Dymon was located. The amounts were generally about 10-20% of the value of each awarded purchase.

### The PCA offences in relation to CAI

10     In August 2016, Lim left Dymon to become the Associate Director of CAI. At CAI he was responsible of IT matters and the procurement of IT-related services and products. Apart from him, there was only one other staff in CAI’s IT Department. That staff was merely an administrative staff with limited IT knowledge. For purchases above $25,000, Lim reported to James Thong, the Managing Director of Consultancy for approval, and for purchases up to $25,000, he reported to Lee Hock Lye, the Deputy Managing Director of Consultancy for approval.

11     The procurement process at CAI was as follows – Lim was allowed to approach any vendor to obtain quotes from the open market, before conducting due diligence and making recommendations on the suitable vendor for the purchase. In making his recommendations, Lim had to provide the various vendors’ quotes and email correspondences with the vendors to show that he had requested them to prepare the relevant quotes. Lim was also required to furnish the same set of documents to CAI’s finance department. For all purchases above $5,000, Lim was required to provide quotes from at least three different vendors.

12     The commission arrangement between Lim and the Accused at Dymon continued after Lim had joined CAI. The Accused knew that Lim would be the one signing off on the quotations. He also knew that this arrangement was wrong as Lim was not allowed to take any money from vendors. Nonetheless, the Accused agreed to the arrangement as he wanted to obtain sales for FTT from Lim. Pursuant to the arrangement, Lim introduced FTT to CAI. Instead of conducting neutral evaluations and recommendations of suitable vendors, Lim had recommended FTT. In total, from November 2016 to September 2017, Lim was involved in awarding a total of 78 purchases to FTT in return for commissions from the Accused. The 11 occasions in relation to the proceeded charges were -

13     On all these occasions, the Accused had handed the gratifications to Lim at the carpark at Changi Airport Terminal 2. The amounts comprised 10-20% of the value of each awarded purchase.

### The PC charges

14     As CAI’s procurement process for quotations above $5,000 required Lim to provide quotes from at least three different vendors, he sought help from the Accused to obtain false supporting quotes which reflected a higher price than the quotes from FTT. This was to justify recommending FTT to CAI. Ng agreed to create these false supporting quotes to fulfil the three different quotes required under CAI’s procurement process. Ng did this to ensure that FTT would be awarded the purchases.

15     In this regard, Ng directed Foong, his subordinate at FTT, to prepare false quotes bearing the letterheads of Dacon Networks Pte Ltd (“Dacon”) and Eztech Services Pte Ltd (“Eztech”). These companies’ letterheads were used because they had previously submitted quotes to FTT. These were done without the knowledge of these companies. These false quotes were then submitted to Lim. Lim had also created false email chains purportedly between himself and officers of Dacon and Extech to support the fiction that the quotes had been provided by these companies.

16     Pursuant to the conspiracy, the following quotes were forged –

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.56%"> <col width="32.72%"> <col width="33.72%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Charge No</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Date of offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Amount Quoted</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 935485/19</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">14 Nov 16</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$13,642</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">DAC 935486/19</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">15 Nov 16</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$13,535.50</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

17     In DAC 935485/19, the false quote bore the letterhead of Dacon. In addition, Lim had created fictitious email correspondences purportedly between him and Teo Wen Kenn of Dacon connected to the said quote. In DAC 935486/19, the false quote bore the letterhead of Eztech. In addition, Lim had created fictitious email correspondences purportedly between him and Shawn Loo of Eztech connected to the said quote.

## Antecedents

18     The Accused was a first offender.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

19     DPP Victoria Ting sought for a global sentence of 40 weeks’ imprisonment. In relation to the individual charges, she sought for parity in sentencing with Lim who had pleaded guilty to 17 PCA charges and 4 PC forgery charges, and 92 other charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Lim was sentenced to a global sentence of 45 weeks’ imprisonment and directed to pay a penalty of $215,237 in default 20 weeks’ imprisonment. The 17 PCA charges to which Lim had pleaded guilty were the same PCA offences proceeded against the Accused. And two of the four PC forgery charges to which Lim had pleaded guilty were the same forgery offences proceeded against the Accused.

20     For the PCA offences, sentences ranging from four to 16 weeks’ imprisonment were meted out. For the PC forgery charges, Lim was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment each.

21     The reasons for the prosecution’s sentencing position were –

> (a)     The case fell under the second category of _Syed Romel_ (_PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 1166</span> (at \[28\]) (“_Syed Romel_”)). The Accused had given gratification to Lim for Lim to forbear from doing what he was supposed to do.

> (b)     The amount involved was significantly large. FTT had been awarded a total of 98 awards involving $215,237 in gratifications. The payments of gratification to Lim had persisted over two and half years, and involved two companies. As held in _Syed Romel_, where the amount of gratification was significant, or where the gratification which were received were over a lengthy period of time, or where there was a serious breach of trust involved, the starting point should be a custodial sentence.

> (c)     The culpability of both Lim and the Accused were effectively equal. The offences were committed over two and a half years. Given this long period of offending, the question who had initiated the arrangement had lost its significance. But it was significant that both had been active participants and they played complementary roles. Both had also benefitted from the corrupt arrangement. Equal culpability meant that the parity principle should apply and the Accused should be give the same sentences as Lim.

> (d)     The individual sentences for the PCA offences were consistent with the case precedents.

22     DPP Ting cited the following cases in support of her sentencing position –

> (a)      _PP v Yong Hock Guan Dennis_ (DAC 906842/15)(“_Yong Hock Guan Dennis_”): The offender, a senior manager of a pipe supply company, had received bribes of about $183,279.16 from buyers and freight forwarders. He also had given bribes to vendors. The offences were committed over four years. The offender was also the initiator of the bribes. He pleaded guilty to 10 counts under s 6(a) PCA and three counts under s 6(b) PCA and one count of s 420 PC and one count of s 406 PC. For the PCA offences, custodial sentences ranging from 2 weeks’ to 12 months’ imprisonment were imposed. Relevant to the present case, for bribes amounts not greater than $4,600, 2-4 weeks’ imprisonment were meted out. For a bribe of $8,674.75, a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment was meted out.

> (b)      _PP v Lu Sang_ (DAC 927089/15 & Ors)(“_Lu Sang_”): The offender, an Assistant Sales Manager, had arranged for three suppliers to mark up the prices of the orders, and the Accused pocketed the difference between the marked up prices and the actual prices as kickbacks. He received a total of $264,666.70 over 24 occasions. The kickback amounts ranged from $1,300 to $23,252. He was convicted after trial and sentenced to a global sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment. For receiving kickbacks ranging from $1,300-$2,200, two months’ imprisonment were meted out, while for kickbacks ranging from $7,470-$8,837, four months’ imprisonment were meted out. The sentence was upheld on appeal.

> (c)      _Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael_ (DAC 942779/15 & Ors)(“_Gursharan Kaur_”): The offender was a Lead Contract Specialist employed by the US Navy, based in Singapore. She had received three bribes totalling $130,278.24 comprising two cash sums of $50,000 each and a luxury hotel stay amounting to $14,977.74. The bribes were for leaking classified information to one Leonard, a US citizen who ran a company supplying US Navy ships. The classified information included US Navy procurement strategy and his competitors’ prices. The information gave Leonard an advantage over his competitors in bidding for contracts to supply US Navy ships at ports in the Pacific and South-East Asia. She pleaded guilty to the charges and had surrendered the whole bribe amount. For the two s 6(a) offence involving the $50,000 bribes, she was sentenced to 16 months’ and 19 months’ imprisonment. The three months uplift for the latter s 6(a) offence was because she had sought for the bribe. For the third s 6(a) offence involving the bribe of $14,977.74, she was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment.

> (d)      _PP v Kang Leong Chuan_ (DAC 923218/16 & Ors)(“_Kang Leong Chuan_”): The offender was a director of a company dealing in the installation and servicing of fire protection systems. He had bribed a technical officer with the Changi Airport Group in return for that officer’s help to ensure that his company’s jobs with the Group ran smoothly. At the technical officer’s request, the offender also helped to procure false quotes to support his company’s bid for small value purchase jobs. There was no evidence that safety was compromised as a result of the offences. The total amount of bribes was $39,700. The offender pleaded guilty to three s 6(b) PCA charges and one s 6(c) PCA charge. The global sentence meted out was five months’ imprisonment. For the charge involving a bribe of $4,700, the sentence was one month’s imprisonment. For the charge involving a bribe of $20,000, the sentence was four months’ imprisonment.

> (e)      _PP v Liong Kah Wei Jason & Anor_ (MA 9188 & 9141 of 2019)(“_Liong Kah Wei Jason_”): The offender gave gratification totalling $8,000 to an engineer with NetLink Trust for the engineer to allow him to submit false quotations (in the name of his company’s competitors) to ensure that his company was awarded contracts with NetLink worth $911,867.40. He pleaded guilty to one s 6(b) PCA offence involving a bribe of $2,500. 13 similar charges were taken into consideration. For the s 6(b) offence, he was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment.

> (f)      _PP v Thong Ching Boon_ (DAC 934776/19 & Ors)(“_Thong Ching Boon_”): The offender was a senior executive of his company which provided management services for properties. He was responsible for overseeing building works, maintenance and repairs at Paragon Shopping Centre. On 10 occasions over two years, he had accepted bribes ranging between $1,280 to $19,000 from a water-proofing company as a reward for advancing the company’s business interests with his company. In the commission of these offences, he had also used false supporting quotations. The parties agreed that the case fell into the _Syed Romel_ second category. The global sentence meted out was 38 weeks’ imprisonment; for the charges involving bribes of $15,000 each, the sentence was 17 weeks’ imprisonment, and for the charges involving bribes of $18,633 and $19,000, the sentence meted out was 21 weeks’ imprisonment each.

### Mitigation plea

23     The Accused was 45 years old. He was supporting his wife and two young children.

24     Mr Nalachandran submitted for a global sentence of 16-24 weeks’ imprisonment. The reasons were as follow –

> (a)     The case fell under the first category under _Syed Romel_, which was arguably the least aggravated or culpable.

> (b)     FTT was a vendor with Dymon before Lim had joined Dymon. When Lim joined Dymon, he had initiated the arrangement for sales commissions. The Accused had agreed to the arrangement because he realised the possibility that FTT could stop receiving contracts from Dymon if he refused. The commission arrangement continued when Lim left Dymon and joined CAI. Again, this arrangement was initiated by Lim.

> (c)     There was no extensive web of corruption present as the Accused had given gratification only to Lim. Further, Lim had retained all the gratifications whereas FTT had used the proceeds of the contracts towards office overheads. The Accused’s personal gain was therefore lower compared to Lim’s personal gain.

> (d)     Lim had created the false email chains without the Accused’s knowledge. This showed that Lim was the mastermind and so his culpability was therefore higher than the Accused. As such the principle of parity in sentencing did not apply.

> (e)     The sentences meted out on Lim were excessively high and were not consistent with the case precedents, in particular, _PP v Ang Seng Thor <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span>_(“_Ang Seng Thor_”). _Ang Seng Thor_ was very similar to the present case. The value involved was very similar ie $215,237. The scale of the offences were also comparable. If Ang Seng Thor was used as a guide, the global sentence for the present case should be about 20-24 weeks’ imprisonment. He argued that even if an uplift from the sentences meted out in _Ang Seng Thor_ was warranted, the uplifts proposed by the prosecution were certainly not warranted.

> (f)     The case precedents showed that givers of gratification were usually given lower sentences than receivers of gratification. As such, the cases involving offences under s 6(a) PCA cited by the prosecution were not applicable.

25     Mr Nalachandran relied on the following cases in support of his submission on sentence –

> (a)      _PP v Lo Hock Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 23</span> (“_Lo Hock Peng_”): The offender was a director and had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 6(b) PCA with two similar charges taken into consideration. The total gratification involved was $136,018 to secure contracts valued to over US$4 million. The giver of the gratification was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment, whereas the receiver was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.

> (b)      _PP v Tan Thiam Chye & Ors_ (unreported)(“_Tan Thiam Chye”)_: The offenders were directors and had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(b) PCA and one charge under s 5(b)(i) PCA with six similar charges taken into consideration. The total gratification involved was US$374,295.42 for sales amounting to US$12 million. The global sentence imposed was 27 weeks’ imprisonment.

> (c)      _PP v Ang Seng Thor <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 217</span>_(“_Ang Seng Thor_”): The offender, a CEO of a listed company, had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(b) PCA. Two similar charges under s 6(b) PCA and two charges under s 57(1)(k) of the Immigration Act were taken into consideration. The gratification involved in the proceeded charges were $147,158 (the total gratification was $215,237). The global sentence imposed was 45 weeks’ imprisonment and a penalty of $215,237.

26     Mr Nalachandran submitted that He also pointed out that in _Tan Thiam Chye_, the amounts involved were double that in the present case and yet the global sentence meted out was only 27 weeks’ imprisonment. He highlighted that three of the cases cited by the prosecution involved s 6(a) PCA offences which were not relevant to the case at hand. The remainder two cases cited by the prosecution which involved s 6(b) PCA offences, lower sentences were imposed.

### The prescribed punishments

27     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 6(b) PCA was a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.

28     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 468 PC was imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, and shall also be liable to a fine.

## Sentence

### The applicable sentencing principles

29     There was public interest that the private sector maintained a reputation for being corruption free, that businesses were conducted in a fair and transparent manner to ensure that the public’s legitimate expectations of _bona fides_, commercial even-handedness and economic welfare were not prejudiced. I was also mindful that custodial sentences should be imposed as a deterrent in cases involving managers (especially senior managers) or concerned corrupt influence over large and important business transactions, or where the offences were systematic, or that the offences had occurred over a long period of time, as opposed to one-off incidents: at \[41\] and \[42\] of _Ang Seng Thor_.

30     I was also mindful that givers of corrupt gratification generally bore equal culpability to receivers of corrupt gratification, and therefore the sentences meted out should be similar: at \[21\] of _Chua Tiong Tiong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 515</span> (“_Chua Tiong Tiong_”).

31     The _Syed Romel_ categories were meant only as analytical tools, are not watertight and could possibly shade into one another. I was mindful that sentencing in the context of corruption cases was an intensely factual exercise. In determining the appropriate sentence, the court had to correctly locate the facts of the case, including the circumstances of the offender within the continuum of the facts in previously decided cases: at \[31\] of _Syed Romel_.

### Was the custodial threshold breached?

32     I agreed with DPP Ting’s submission that the present case fell into the second category of _Syed Romel_. The Accused had given gratification to Lim to induce Lim to forbear from doing what he was duty-bound to do in the interest of Lim’s employers. I did not agree with Mr Nalachandran’s characterisation of the case as falling into the first category of _Syed Romel_. However, I was mindful that even for cases under the second category, a custodial sentence did not automatically follow. As Menon CJ had pointed out, cases under the second category of Syed Romel would frequently attract custodial sentences. That meant all the relevant facts and circumstances should be considered in determining the appropriate sentence.

33     I was satisfied that the starting point for the present case was a custodial sentence because of the aggravating factors that were present. The amount of gratification was significant. The offences were committed over a lengthy period of time of two and a half years. In fact, it continued even when Lim left Dymon and moved to CAI. As director of FTT, the Accused was at the apex of FTT’s management. The Accused’s seniority in FTT’s management was an additional aggravating factor which added greatly to the seriousness of the offence.

### Does the principle of parity in sentencing apply?

34     As discussed above, the giver of a corrupt gratification in most cases would bear equal culpability as that of the receiver. Sentences meted out should therefore be similar in terms, unless where the giver was under some form of compulsion or pressure to give the gratification. In such a scenario, the receiver would be punished more harshly.

35     In the present case, I did not find any evidence of any compulsion or pressure put to bear on the Accused to give gratifications to Lim. The defence’s best case was the assertion that Lim had all along been the initiator of the commission arrangement. The Accused had agreed because he knew that there was a possibility that FTT would be denied contracts from Dymon and CAI if he did not agree. Although FTT had an existing business relationship with Dymon before Lim was employed at Dymon, but the business relationship was only in relation to the supply of telephone system to Dymon. The commission arrangement that was agreed upon by the Accused and Lim was in relation to the supply of Microsoft licences, which was a totally new business. Along the same lines, before Lim moved to CAI and established the commission arrangement with the Accused, FTT did not have any business relationship with CAI. Therefore, the Accused had agreed to participate in the commission arrangement with Lim because of the new business opportunity that FTT would benefit from and not because of any undue compulsion or pressure.

36     Even if there was some form of compulsion or pressure, I did not think the compulsion or pressure was sufficient to substantially reduce the Accused’s culpability, if at all. As noted by V K Rajah J in _Ang Seng Thor_, “…it is part of the normal cut and thrust of business that clients or suppliers often threaten to take their business elsewhere in order to extract favourable concessions.” (at \[51\] of the Judgment).

37     I was also not convinced that Lim was the mastermind because he had initiated the commission arrangements both in relation to Dymon and CAI, and he had created fake email threads to support the submissions of the forged quotations. As aptly described by DPP Ting, the roles played by the Accused and Lim were complementary. Each had played different roles suited to their respective positions in their own companies. The fictitious email between Lim and the officers of Dacon and Eztech were supposed to show discussions between them about the quotations. Lim would be familiar with what would normally be discussed in relation to the subject-matter.

38     I did not agree with the submission that the Accused’s personal gain was lower compared to that of Lim simply because Lim had retained all the gratifications whereas FTT had used the proceeds of the contracts towards office overheads. The Accused was the Director and shareholder of FTT. Clearly, any benefit conferred on FTT was a benefit gained by the Accused. The successful awards of contracts by FTT was a benefit gained by the Accused.

39     For the above reasons, I was of the view that there should be parity in sentencing. As the PCA charges and the PC charges against the Accused and Lim were in relation to the same set of offences, the same individual sentences meted out on Lim should be imposed on the Accused.

### Were the sentences meted out against Lim excessive?

40     Mr Nalachandran submitted that the individual sentences in relation to the PCA offences meted out on Lim were excessive and did not accord with the case precedents. He relied namely on two case precedents, _Ang Seng Thor_ and _PP v Tan Thiam Chye & Ors_ (unreported)(“_Tan Thiam Chye”)._

41     In _Ang Seng Thor_, the offender was the CEO of a public listed company in the business of supplying equipment and precision tools to semiconductor manufacturers. The offender had given kickbacks to one Ho, an assistant engineer with Seagate in exchange for Seagate ordering goods from the offender’s company. Ho had hinted to the offender that if he did not receive kickbacks, he would refer Seagate’s business to other companies. The offender pleaded guilty to two s 6(b) PCA charges and two similar charges were taken into consideration. The total gratification for the two proceeded charges was $147,158. The total gratification in relation to all four charges was $207,508.10. A sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment and fine of $25,000 was meted out for each of the two PCA charges, with the imprisonment sentences ordered to run consecutively.

42     In _Tan Thiam Chye_, the offenders were directors and had pleaded guilty to two charges under s 6(b) PCA and one charge under s 5(b)(i) PCA with six similar charges taken into consideration. The total gratification involved was US$374,295.42 for sales amounting to US$12 million. The global sentence imposed was 27 weeks’ imprisonment.

43     Mr Nalachandran argued that _Ang Seng Thor_ represented the baseline for sentences in relation to s 6(b) PCA offences, while _Tan Thiam Chye_ represented its high watermark. I respectfully disagreed. It was incongruous with the observations of Menon CJ in _Syed Romel_ that sentencing in the context of corruption cases was an intensely factual exercise, and the court had to correctly locate the facts of the case, including the circumstances of the offender within the continuum of the facts in previously decided cases.

44     I disagreed with Mr Nalachandran’s submission that _Ang Seng Thor_ was similar to the present case. Although the value of the bribes were closely similar, the similarity ended there. The scale of the offences were markedly different. The offending conduct in the present case was more persistent in that the charges were far more numerous. The offences were committed over two and a half years, which represented a significant period of time. The offences continued unabated even when Lim had moved to another company with which the Accused had no prior business relationship. All these made the present case more egregious than the offences in _Ang Seng Thor_.

45      _Ang Seng Thor_ was decided in 2011. Although it was still useful as a sentencing guide, in my mind, the more recent cases were more relevant in determining the current sentencing trend for such offences. This was done by V K Rajah J in _Ang Seng Thor_ itself when he compared that case with the more recent cases at the time involving similar factual matrixes (at \[64\] of the Judgment). Having done that in this case, I was satisfied that the sentences meted out against Lim for the PCA offences were not inconsistent or incongruous with the more recent case precedents set out in \[21\] above.

## Conclusion

46     All considered, in relation to the PCA offences, I sentenced the Accused as follows –

47     In relation to the s 468 PC offences, both parties were essentially in agreement on the quantum of sentence that was appropriate, which was, four weeks’ imprisonment. This proposed quantum was consistent with the case precedents cited namely, _PP v Zhenmi_ (DAC 924999/18 & Ors) where five weeks’ imprisonment was meted out for each of the proceeded 15 s 468 charges, and _PP v Toh Teow Hui_ (DAC 908013/16 & Ors) where two weeks’ imprisonment was imposed for each of nine s 468 charges.

48     As such, I imposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment for each of the two s 468 PC offences in DAC 935485/19 and DAC 935486/19.

49     I ordered the sentences of imprisonment in DAC 935388/19 (16 weeks’ imprisonment), DAC 935400/19 (eight weeks’ imprisonment) and DAC 935473/19 (16 weeks’ imprisonment) to run consecutively. The total aggregate sentence was 40 weeks’ imprisonment. This was five weeks’ short of the global sentence meted out to Lim, reason being Lim had two more s 468 offences proceeded against him. In any event, the 40 weeks’ imprisonment sentence was warranted to give effect to the principle of deterrence.

50     The Accused has lodged an appeal against the sentence. He is currently serving his sentence of imprisonment.
