COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS – Sale of goods – Breach of contract

16 November 2020

### District Judge Wong Peck:

## Introduction

1       The plaintiff brought the present action against the defendant for failure to pay for goods sold and delivered to the defendant. The goods in question were used in plant and piping systems. These were 8 units of 12” Gate Valve (motorised), 2 units of 14” Check Valve, 2 units of 14” Gate Valve (motorised) and 2 units of 6” Gate Valve (manual). Pursuant to a tax invoice dated 28 November 2016, the sum claimed in Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) is $97,028 with the statutory interest and costs. I allowed the amendment of the Statement of Claim on the day of the trial to include the aforesaid fixed sum or such other sum as the Court deems fit and an alternative claim of damages to be assessed. This is because I had accepted the plaintiff’s submissions that although such an application was made late in the day, the amendments were not prejudicial to the defendant as it did not change the material facts or nature of the dispute.[^1] Costs of $1,200 was awarded to the defendant for the lateness of the application.

2       The defendant disputed that the good delivered were the ones which the defendant had requested for. As these goods did not meet the defendant’s specifications, they had to be modified for the use of a third party in Myanmar (known as “MMTM”) whom the defendant had sold them to.

3       After hearing the evidence and considering the parties’ submissions, I decide to grant judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $97,028 with the usual statutory interest thereon from date of writ to judgment and dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim. I set out the grounds for my decision below.

## Facts

### The parties

4       On 19 October 2016, the defendant emailed the plaintiff seeking availability of stock and pricing for the disputed goods. On the same day, the plaintiff replied that they have ready stock of the manual valves and the motorised ones can be shipped within two weeks. As for the check valves, these would arrive in 4 weeks. On 21 October 2016, the defendant asked the plaintiff to place the order first as time was needed to prepare the Purchase Order. The plaintiff complied and emailed the quotation of 21 October 20216 to the defendant. This was followed by the defendant’s Purchase Order dated 9 November 2016 (P/O No 178/2016).

5       On 10 November 2016, the defendant emailed the plaintiff asking for 2 more units of the 6” Gate Valves for which the plaintiff confirmed that he had existing stock. However, the defendant indicated that he would confirm again if these two additional units were required. On 28 November 2016, the plaintiff issued a tax invoice (LUMI-16-INV-1031) for the sum of $97,028 which included the additional two units of $552 each. The goods were delivered on 27 November 2016.

6       A total of two witnesses gave evidence in court. They were the plaintiff’s regional sales director, Ooi Eng Sin and the defendant’s sole director, Fan Yok Kong.

## The parties’ cases

### The plaintiff’s version

7       The plaintiff asserts that they had supplied the goods as requested for by the defendant. This assertion has been substantiated by all the relevant documents and emails such as the defendant’s first email request of 19 October 2016[^2], the plaintiff’s Quotation of 21 October 2016[^3], the defendant’s Purchase Order of 9 November 2016[^4] and the plaintiff’s Tax Invoice of 28 November 2016[^5].

8       Therefore, the defendant’s additional specifications for the goods as stated in their Defence and Counterclaim do not form part of the contract between the parties[^6]. Hence, the plaintiff is not obliged to fulfil these specifications and these alleged specifications are an afterthought on the defendant’s part. Even after the goods were delivered, the defendant did not raise any objection as to the goods and had transmitted the goods to MMTM. Even as at 13 March 2017, the defendants did not mention these additional specifications. According to the plaintiff, the defendant did not pay because they had not been paid by MMTM.[^7]

9       The email exchange between the parties in July 2017 seems to suggest that the plaintiff had apologised for delivering the wrong goods to them. However, a close inspection of the emails shows that the apology was for delivering a faulty valve and not for wrong goods that did not meet the defendant’s additional specifications.[^8] Finally, at the very least, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment for sums of $2,208 and $5,372 as the defendants did not dispute the 4 units of the 6” manual Gate Valve (priced at $552 each) and 2 units of 14” check valve (priced at $2,686 each) as the disputed additional specifications relate to the motorised valves.[^9] According to the plaintiff, the motorised Gate Valves are also known as actuator[^10] for which the mechanical specifications are stated in the plaintiff’s Quotation, the defendant’s Purchase Order and the plaintiff’s Tax Invoice.

### The defendant’s version

10     The defendant’s position is that the wrong goods were supplied to them. According to the defendant, the plaintiff knew the functions which the defendant had expected the goods to perform. The defendant claimed that the brochure exhibited in his AEIC and sent by Mr Ooi on 9 February 2017 for another project was the one that they had wanted for the MMTM project and the defendant had ordered a similar one for a 2015 project[^11].

11     Reliance was placed on the email exchange between parties in July 2017 where the plaintiff had purportedly apologised for the goods. According to the defendant, the apology was for wrong goods delivered[^12].

## Issues to be determined

12     The issues before the Court are as follows:

> a.     What was the plaintiff apologising for in his email of 21 July 2017? Was the apology for delivering the wrong valve or for faulty valve?

> b.     Is the defendant liable to pay the sums of sums of $2,208 and $5,372 as the defendants did not dispute the 4 units of the 6” manual Gate Valve (priced at $552 each) and 2 units of 14” check valve (priced at $2,686 each) as the disputed additional specifications relate to the motorised valves?

> c.     Is the defendant liable to pay the full sum claimed of $97,028?

## Issue 1:   What was the plaintiff apologising for in his email of 21 July 2017? Was the apology for delivering the wrong valve or for faulty valve?

13     There are two conflicting versions put forth by parties as regards the purpose of the plaintiff’s apology in Mr Ooi’s email of 21 July 2017. According to the plaintiff, the apology was for supplying a faulty valve rather than for supplying the wrong goods as alleged by the defendant. The subject email is reproduced below:

> Dear Mr Fan

> Factory apologized for all the inconvenience causes you had with your client.

> We appreciated if problem can be solved in your manner, factory will bear the costs to make the MOV works.

> Right now, to replace new set will take longer delivery lead time to the site… we would do our best in either ways…

> We sincerely took the responsible overlook the matter…truly sorry!

> Best regards

> Wilson Ooi

14     This email is pertinent as it forms part of the chain of emails between parties which are contemporaneous documents. I find that the apology was for delivering a faulty set rather than for a wrong set that did not meet the specifications of the defendant. As pointed by the plaintiff, the emphasis is on the word “new set”. If the plaintiff had intended to apologise for delivering the wrong set, he would have stated “correct set” in his email. During cross-examination, Mr Ooi explained that he was under the impression that the valve was not working because of wear and tear as the valve was not installed immediately by the end customer after they were delivered[^13]. I accept that this is a plausible explanation that the basis of his apology related to a faulty valve.

15     I find that Mr Fan was aware even in November 2017 that Mr Ooi was under the impression that the goods delivered had technical problems and not that it was the wrong goods delivered. This can be seen in Mr Fan’s email of 1 November 2017 addressed to Mr Ooi and a Mr Chan. In paragraph 2 of Mr Fan’s email addressed to Mr Ooi, he wrote:

> For Inv 31 Till now you do not understand the situation and thinking is technical problems.

16     Hence, Mr Fan would have known that Mr Ooi’s apology in July 2017 was not for delivering the wrong actuator but a faulty one. Although the defendant takes issue with Mr Ooi not stating clearly that he had delivered the correct albeit faulty actuator[^14], the same can be said about Mr Fan who referred to the actuator as a “bad quality MOV” in his email of 2 January 2018 when Mr Fan had intended to refer to wrong actuator that had been delivered.

## Issue 2:   Is the defendant liable to pay the sums of sums of $2,208 and $5,372 as the defendants did not dispute the 4 units of the 6” manual Gate Valve (priced at $552 each) and 2 units of 14” check valve (priced at $2,686 each) as the disputed additional specifications relate to the motorised valves?

17     According to the plaintiff, Mr Ooi had emailed Mr Fan on 31 October 2017 asking for payment for the manual valves and the check valve first. The defendant had replied the next day on 1 November 2017 indicating willingness to pay for these items[^15].

18     During cross-examination, Mr Fan agreed that he should pay for these goods.[^16] This point has also been highlighted by the plaintiff in its closing submissions. [^17]I find that the plaintiff is entitled to be paid these sums of $2,208 and $5,372 as the defendants did not dispute the 4 units of the 6” manual Gate Valve (priced at $552 each) and 2 units of 14” check valve (priced at $2,686 each) in the contemporaneous documents produced in court.

## Issue 3:   Is the defendant liable to pay the full sum claimed of $97,028?

19     I find that the defendant is liable to pay the full sum claimed of $97,028. In the cross-examination of Mr Ooi, various attempts were made by the plaintiff’s counsel to allude to previous transactions on similar goods Mr Ooi had with Mr Fan when Mr Ooi was working with a different company known as Pacific Oilfield. This suggests that the defendant is attempting to introduce incorporation of terms by prior course of dealings which had not been pleaded by the defendant. Therefore, I did not allow such questions during the cross-examination of Mr Ooi. As rightly pointed out by the plaintiff, the model of actuator specified in the brochure and manual does not correspond with the one stated in the Purchase Order[^18]. I note that although Mr Fan has testified that it was not practical to state the full wordings of the “AFCT Intelligent Actuator” in the Purchase Order, it was a mere additional 3 words that had to be included in the Purchase Order if Mr Fan had intended to purchase such an actuator.[^19] The defendant submitted that the understanding between parties was based on AMM series actuator which would possess intelligent functions. I find that there is insufficient evidence of such understanding before the Court.[^20]. The defendant also submitted that their arguments on not pleaded case of incorporation of terms by way of reference or prior course of dealings did not prejudice the plaintiff as the defendant’s AEIC filed on 22 July 2020 alluded to these areas[^21]. I find that to allow the not pleaded case would have changed the complexion of the case and hence, prejudicial to the plaintiff.

20     During re-examination, Mr Ooi clarified that the brochures exhibited in Mr Fan’s AEIC did not contain the Gate Valves that were described in the Purchase Order[^22]. It is noteworthy that the brochures were provided to the defendant by the plaintiff via his email of 24 August 2015[^23] during the latter’s employment with Pacific Oilfield, clearly for different projects.

21     In the cross-examination of Mr Fan, he agreed that the Quotation, Purchase Order and Tax Invoice showed the goods that he had ordered from the plaintiff.[^24] Mr Fan also agreed that the pleadings did not show that the defendant had dealt with the plaintiff for the AMM series of Gate Valves or actuators.[^25] He also conceded that the AFCT intelligent electronic actuator which he had claimed in his AEIC[^26] should have been delivered by the plaintiff was not stated in the Purchase Order nor the Tax Invoice[^27]. Neither was the AFCT intelligent actuator stated in the Defence and Counterclaim.

22     In this regard, I find that the documents which form the contract, namely the Quotation, Purchase Order and Tax Invoice, clearly stated the goods which defendant had contracted to purchase, namely the AMM series motorised actuator. The additional specifications found in paragraph 9 of the counterclaim of the defendant were a convenient afterthought designed to evade payment for goods sold and delivered by the plaintiff. The defendant only realised his mistake later, around late November 2017 or 2018 when he emailed the plaintiff on 8 May 2018 stating that the actuator was of the wrong specification. This is also borne out by the fact that “AFCT intelligent actuator” was not stated in any of the pleadings. This only came in belatedly in Mr Fan’s AEIC.

23     The defendant alleges that the characteristics of the AMM series actuator with intelligent functions did not correspond with the actuator that was delivered[^28]. As the contract between parties was finalised in November 2016, the brochure on “AMM/AMT Intelligent Electronic Actuator” which was sent by the plaintiff in his email of 9 February 2017 could not have formed part or varied the contract as the goods were already delivered and sent to Myanmar around end December 2016. The goods arrived at the Myanmar worksite in January 2017.[^29] In any case, Mr Fan also conceded during cross-examination that the brochure and manual on the AFCT actuator exhibited in his AEIC were sent by Mr Ooi as the defendant had issues in another project[^30]. This is consistent with paragraph 15 of Mr Fan’s AEIC. Upon realising his mistake after the actuator was installed in the work site in Myanmar, Mr Fan then attempted to engage third party contractors to alter the actuator to suit the needs of the Myanmar project. If the goods delivered were the wrong ones, a reasonable man would have insisted on returning the wrong goods and arranging for the correct ones to be delivered to replace the wrong ones. However, this was not possible as the documents which form the contract clearly stated that the goods delivered were the correct ones and the defendant had not exercised due diligence in ensuring that those goods met his requirements at the time the contract was formed.

24     The defendant attempts to attribute blame on the plaintiff in that it was the plaintiff which liaised with the factory to customise the actuator.[^31] But this does not detract from the fact that the defendant failed to specify his actual specifications at the time when the contract was formed.

25     As I have earlier held that the goods delivered were the ones under the contract, there is no necessity for me to determine if the goods were capable of performing the functions found in the additional specifications outlined by the defendant in his Defence and Counterclaim. Neither was an expert opinion obtained and produced in court to testify as to the functionalities of the actuator supplied to the defendant[^32]. Mr Fan also agreed during cross-examination that he did not have personal knowledge as to the functionalities[^33]. Accordingly, the defendant’s Counterclaim is dismissed.

## Conclusion

26     For the above reasons, I find that the plaintiff has proven its claim on a balance of probabilities and therefore grant judgment in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $97,028 with the usual statutory interest from date of writ to judgment and dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim. I will now hear parties on costs.
