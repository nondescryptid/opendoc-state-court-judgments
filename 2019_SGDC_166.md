13 August 2019

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 50 year-old male Singaporean, made a discretionary right turn at a cross-junction. He failed to give way to oncoming traffic and knocked down a motor-cyclist causing injuries to the said motor-cyclist. The accused was charged with an offence of dangerous driving punishable under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276). He claimed trial to the charge and was convicted at the conclusion of the trial. He was given a fine of $5,000 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for 2 years.

2       He is appealing against the conviction and sentence. The payment of the fine and the order of disqualification are stayed pending the appeal.

## Charge

3       For ease of reference, the single charge against the accused is set out as follows:

> You…are charged that you, on 25 December 2016, at or around 1.06pm, at the signalised junction of West Coast Road and Jurong Town Hall Road, Singapore, did drive your motorcar SLF6661D in a manner which was dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature, condition and use of the road and the amount of traffic which was actually at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road, to wit, by failing to give way to a vehicle while you were making a right-turn, thus resulting in a collision with a motorcycle bearing registration number FBJ3233Z while the said motorcycle was travelling along West Coast Road towards Jurong Town Hall Road, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).

## The Prosecution’s Case

4       The prosecution’s case is grounded on (i) the undisputed facts, (ii) the video footage of the accident captured by the traffic camera at the location (“video”)[^1], (iii) the oral testimony of the motor-cyclist (“victim”), and the oral testimony of an independent eye-witness. The collision itself, the damage to the vehicles, the parties involved and the time, date and location of the collision are not in dispute. The fact that the victim sustained injuries is also undisputed.

5       The prosecution’s case is fairly simple and straightforward and summarised in the prosecution’s submission.[^2] In summary, on the day of Christmas in December 2016, at around 1.06pm, the accused drove his car and made a right turn at the signalised junction of West Coast Road and Jurong Town Hall Road (“the junction”). It was a discretionary turn because the green turning arrow had not come on yet. In proceeding with the discretionary turn, the accused failed to give way to the 64-year old victim (PW1 Teo Beng Huat) who was riding his motor-cycle along West Coast Road (in the direction of West Coast Highway). The traffic light was green in the victim’s favour as he rode into the junction. The accused collided into the victim’s motor-cycle who had the right of way. As a result of the collision, the victim was flung up into the air and over the entire length of accused’s car before landing on the road behind the accused’s car. The victim sustained minor head injuries and was on hospitalisation and outpatient medical leave for more than three months cumulatively.[^3]

6       Although disputed by the accused, the prosecution’s case is that the speed limit at the junction is 70 km/h as prescribed in the Third Schedule to the Road Traffic (Restriction of Speed on Roads) Notification (N 6)(“subsidiary legislation”).[^4]

7       The prosecution contends that the accused had driven in a dangerous manner having regard to all the circumstances, particularly by executing a right turn and not giving way to the oncoming victim who had the right of way.

### Victim and Eye-witness’s Evidence

8       The victim is 64-years old. He is a shift driver by profession. On the day and time in question, he rode his motor-cycle straight along West Coast Road in the direction of West Coast Highway. The traffic light was green in his favour as he rode into the junction. He was travelling at about 50-60 km/h and was not speeding.[^5] The accused was not supposed to make a turn but he did so and collided into the victim. The victim was conveyed to the hospital. He sustained a minor head injury.[^6] In addition, he also sustained injuries to his arms and lower back and aches to his entire body. The victim was given hospitalisation and outpatient medical leave.

9       The independent eye-witness is PW2 Chia Kok Poon (“witness”). He was also driving (a white van) along West Coast Road in the direction of West Coast Highway i.e. in the same direction as the victim. The victim was behind him. The witness then veered off to the left before the junction into the slip road leading to Jurong Town Hall Road. In other words, before reaching the junction, he turned left towards Jurong Town Hall Road. He saw the accused’s car colliding into victim’s motor-cycle at the junction. The victim was overtaking him just as he was veering off. The witness was travelling at about 50-60 km/h and testified that the victim was probably travelling at that speed as well. The witness disagreed with the accused’s assertion that the victim was travelling at more than 100 km/h. The witness said that even when the victim was overtaking the witness, the victim would at most be travelling at 70 km/h and not 100 km/h.[^7]

10     The witness testified that regardless of the victim’s speed, the accused should have looked out for him and not simply knock him down.[^8]

## Close of Prosecution’s Case

11     At the close of the prosecution’s case, I found that there was prima facie evidence to support the elements of the charge. Accordingly, I called on the accused to give his defence to the charge.

## The Defence

12     The accused elected to give evidence. He was the only witness for the defence. He was and is a private-hire driver. He tendered photographs which he had taken of the junction.[^9] These were not contemporaneous photographs of the accident but taken for the purposes of the trial. The photos show the view of a driver as one approaches the junction from either direction of West Coast Road. The accused also supplemented his oral evidence with three personal statements setting out his defence.[^10]

13     In summary, the accused said that he saw the victim’s motor-cycle. He said that “\[w\]hen I saw him, he was far behind the van.”[^11] He claimed that the victim overtook the witness just before the junction and sped forward colliding into him as he was making a right turn. The accused claimed that the victim was travelling at more than 100 km/h. He also claimed that the victim collided into him and not that he knocked into the victim.[^12] In short, he did not agree that he was driving dangerously and he pinned the blame for the accident squarely on the victim for speeding. The accused disputed that the speed limit at the junction is 70 km/h. He argued that since there was a school nearby, the junction ought to be considered a school zone and therefore, the speed limit would have been 40 km/h.

14     The accused disputed the testimonies of the victim and the witness saying they were both lying. He had secretly recorded a conversation with the witness at the scene and the conversation was tendered in evidence. However, it turned out to be a one-sided conversation because the witness’s voice cannot be heard.[^13]

15     The accused also took issue with investigating officers for not having conducted the investigations properly. He was aggrieved that the police did not retrieve the video footage of other traffic cameras along the road before the junction.[^14]

## The Court’s Findings and Decision

### Driving in a Dangerous Manner

#### Failing to give way to victim

16     The undisputed facts speak for themselves. The victim was travelling along West Coast Road and the traffic light was green in his favour as he entered the junction. There can be no doubt and I find that the victim had the right of way vis-à-vis the accused who was making a discretionary right turn.

17     It is also clear from the video that the victim had the right of way. For ease of reference, I will reproduce the relevant screen grabs from the video showing the sequence of events up to the time of collision.[^15]

18     The first screen shot (at time stamp 1:40:101) shows the victim riding into the junction.

![]([2019] SGDC 0166_Image/[2019] SGDC 0166_image1.png)

19     The next screen shot (at time stamp 1:41:002) shows the victim travelling across the junction passing the third lane of Jurong Town Hall Road.

![]([2019] SGDC 0166_Image/[2019] SGDC 0166_image2.png)

20     The next screen shot (at time stamp 1:41:209) shows the victim almost reaching the half-way point of the junction.

![]([2019] SGDC 0166_Image/[2019] SGDC 0166_image3.png)

21     The next screen shot (at time stamp 1:41:670) shows the initial point of contact between the accused’s car and the victim’s motor-cycle.

![]([2019] SGDC 0166_Image/[2019] SGDC 0166_image4.png)

22     The next screen shot (at time stamp 1:42:204) shows the accused’s car colliding into and forcing the victim’s motor-cycle to turn around 180 degrees.

![]([2019] SGDC 0166_Image/[2019] SGDC 0166_image5.png)

23     The final screen shot below (at time stamp 1:42.732) shows the victim (red circle) flying over the length of the accused’s car as the accused completes his turn and enters Jurong Town Hall Road.

![]([2019] SGDC 0166_Image/[2019] SGDC 0166_image6.png)

24     The above photo also clearly shows (red arrow) that the accused’s car is damaged in the front which is consistent with the vehicle damage report.[^16] This conclusively proves that it was the accused who had collided into victim’s motor-cycle and not the other way round as alleged by the accused.

25     From the video and the series of screen shots above, it may be plainly seen that the victim had already travelled halfway across the junction when the front of the accused’s car collided into the victim. There was nothing which could have obstructed the accused’s view of the victim’s oncoming motor-cycle. In fact, as highlighted above, the accused admitted he saw the victim’s motor-cycle “far behind” the witness’s van. In other words, he had already noticed the victim even before the victim overtook the witness’s van.

26     The nub of the accused’s defence is that the victim had overtaken the witness’s white van and sped across the junction. Therefore, by the accused’s account, he would have and did see the victim overtaking the van (which had veered off the main road) and entering the junction with the green traffic light in the victim’s favour.

27     Given these incontrovertible circumstances, the victim clearly had the right of way. Further, regardless of the speed of the victim’s motor-cycle, it was dangerous for the accused to make the discretionary right turn at the said junction when he saw the victim approaching. In fact, the faster the speed of the victim’s motor-cycle, the more dangerous it would have been for the accused to make the right turn. Therefore, the accused’s assertion that the victim was speeding is in fact counter-intuitive.

#### Victim was not speeding

28     I accept the victim’s evidence that he was only travelling at 50-60 km/h. His evidence is corroborated by the witness’s testimony which I also accept without reservation. The witness was an independent witness who happened to be there and he had no reason or motive not to tell the truth or exaggerate his testimony. He refuted the accused’s assertion that the victim was speeding and chided the accused for not looking out for the victim and callously knocking him down. In other words, it was plain, even to the witness that the victim had the right of way, regardless of his speed. I accept the victim’s testimony that he was riding at between 50-60 km/h and did not exceed the speed limit of 70 km/h. I also find that the victim’s estimate of his speed is reasonable and externally consistent with the video footage which do not show the victim to be riding at a very fast speed.

29     I therefore find that the victim was not speeding and certainly not travelling at more than 100 km/h. In any case, regardless of the victim’s speed, the accused should not have made the discretionary turn and it was dangerous for him to do so. If indeed the victim was travelling at a fast speed, it would have been even more dangerous for the accused to execute the discretionary turn into the victim’s path. The accused’s argument that the victim was speeding therefore does not further or assist his defence.

30     I further accept that the speed limit at the junction (as stipulated in the subsidiary legislation) is 70 km/h and not 40 km/h as asserted by the accused.[^17] I further accept that the junction did not fall within a school zone and therefore, the speed limit thereat is not 40 km/h.[^18]

### Other Allegations Unreasonable/Spurious

31     I reject the accused’s allegation that the investigations were unfair and incomplete because the investigating officer did not retrieve the footages from other traffic cameras. I find this insinuation to be baseless and misconceived. I accept the investigator’s evidence that there was only one traffic camera at the junction.[^19] I accept that this was the only traffic camera that was relevant to the investigations.[^20] The reason that the accused kept harping on the other traffic cameras is because he wanted to prove the point that the victim had come from behind and had overtaken the witness’s white van. However, this fact is not in dispute and confirmed by the witness. I note that in his closing submission, the accused stated:

> 3)    I was astonished, and impressed that the Judge really discovered the answer to the mystery of the accident in this keyword: Overtake.

> 4)    This is really a miraculous discovery, after more than 2 long years, which no police, nor prosecutors could know it, do it, and say it out.[^21]

32     It would seem that this fact of overtaking was a critical aspect of his defence. Ignoring the gratuitous accolades heaped upon me, the accused has acknowledged that I fully grasp his defence.[^22] Given that the witness has testified that the victim overtook him as he (the witness) veered off into the slip road, it is irrelevant and did not prejudice the accused that the investigator did not recover any footage (if any) to show what happened before the victim rode into the junction.

33     I also note that the accused made disparaging and spurious allegations and remarks against the learned DPP in the conduct of the prosecution. Amongst other things, the accused insinuated that the DPP was incompetent[^23], naïve[^24], unhelpful[^25] and that he had conducted the prosecution in bad faith[^26]. The DPP has put on record that the prosecution will reserve its full rights to any action against the accused.

### Accused Lacks Credibility

34     I further find that the accused lacked credibility as a witness. He was intransigent and stubborn in his refusal to admit even the slightest fault or error on his part, despite the objective evidence of the eye-witness and video. He claimed to be always right and that everyone else is wrong, including the police and prosecutors. He was also sneaky and sly in secretly recording his conversation with the witness at the scene, in an attempt to get the witness say something in his favour. However, his guile failed him. He was again devious when he let on that he also secretly taped his phone conversation with the investigator in the course of investigations. He said he called the investigator because he had a lot of important things to tell her.”[^27] He did not tell the investigator that he was recording their conversation. He was probably trying to make self-serving statements to the investigator. However, that conversation was ultimately of no use to him because he did not seek to admit the recording. In short, I find the accused to be extremely cunning and lacked credibility and I disbelieved his evidence and defence.

### Conclusion – Verdict

35     In conclusion, on the evidence before me and given all the circumstances of the case, I am satisfied and I find that the accused had driven dangerously when he executed the right turn into Jurong Town Hall Road without giving way to oncoming traffic which had the right of way. Despite seeing that the victim had almost travelled halfway across the junction, he proceeded to turn right and failed to give way to the victim. As a result of his dangerous driving, he collided into the victim’s motor-cycle causing damage to the motor-cycle and injuries to the victim.

36     I am satisfied and I therefore find that the prosecution has proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused is convicted of the charge.

## The Sentence

### Prescribed punishment

37     The punishment prescribed for the present offence under s 64(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276)(“RTA”) is a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. In other words, the court has the discretion to sentence the accused to either a fine or a jail term or a combination of both punishments.

38     In addition, s 42(1) of the RTA empowers the court to order a period of disqualification as follows:

> Disqualification for offences

> 42.-(1)    A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

### Prosecution’s Submission on Sentence

39     The prosecution submitted for a maximum fine of $5,000 and a disqualification order of two years. The prosecution made it clear that it was not pressing for a custodial sentence. I agree with the sentencing factors canvassed by the prosecution which I will elaborate below. I also find that the sentencing principles of deterrence and prevention are relevant and applicable to the circumstances of this case and to the present accused. I would go even further to add that had the prosecution pressed for a custodial sentence, I would have been minded to impose one.

#### Antecedents

40     The prosecution highlighted that the accused has previous antecedents for traffic violations. These include traffic violations for running a red light, several counts of speeding, failing to signal, driving in a bus lane and driving across double white lines. The accused did not dispute these antecedents.

41     The accused’s driving record is consistent with the accused’s disregard for traffic regulations, road safety and general driving etiquette in his commission of the present offence. Notwithstanding that some of these violations may have been compounded, they are still relevant and may be considered to determine the appropriate sentence for this case (see _PP v Koh Thiam Huat_ \[2017\] SGHC) 123 at \[56\]). The number and nature of his prior traffic violations reinforced prosecution’s submission that a period of disqualification is necessary and justified to underscore the seriousness of his present offence and to specifically deter the accused from future dangerous and irresponsible driving. It is obvious that mere monetary fines that were imposed on the accused in the past are not effective to correct and improve the accused’s driving attitude and etiquette on the road.

#### Culpability and harm

42     The High Court in _Tang Ling Lee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 18</span> (“_Tang Ling Lee_”) laid out a sentencing framework in respect of an offence of causing grievous hurt by negligent driving under s 338(b) of the Penal Code. The framework provides three bands of presumptive sentencing ranges to be applied to offenders who are convicted after trial. These sentencing ranges are differentiated according to the degree of harm caused and the level of culpability of the driver. The framework would not strictly apply to the present accused because the present office, albeit related to driving, is a different one both in terms of the nature of the culpability and length of the prescribed imprisonment sentence. Nonetheless, I considered that the twin factors of the degree of culpability and the extent of harm caused (or the potential of harm) would be relevant sentencing considerations for the present offence.

43     Even though the prosecution did not cite any sentencing precedents for the court’s consideration, I am satisfied that the proposed sentence of a fine (albeit the maximum amount) and a 2-year disqualification order is less severe than what would typically be imposed for an offence under s 338(b) of the Penal Code for negligent driving in broadly similar circumstances i.e. colliding into and not giving way to a motor-cyclist when making a turn. Even though the culpability (i.e. negligent driving) may arguably be lower for s 338(b) Penal Code cases than that for the present offence (for dangerous driving), the sentences meted out for the former category of offences in similar scenarios can be higher, depending on the injuries sustained. For example, in one of my previous decisions in _Ramalingam Velayatham v PP_ (MA 9071/2018/01), the accused was convicted after trial of an offence under s 338(b) of the Penal Code for colliding into a motor-cyclist and causing multiple fractures to the victim. The accused in that case was not paying attention and did not see the motor-cyclist as he filtered out from a side road onto a main road. His sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment and two years’ driving disqualification was upheld on appeal.

44     In _Tang Ling Lee_ (also involving a driver making a turn and colliding into a motor-cyclist had the right of way), the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 338(b) of the Penal Code and was given an imprisonment sentence of one week and also disqualified from driving for two years. Therefore, in comparison, I am of the view that the sentence that the prosecution is asking for in the present case (which involves a higher level of culpability) is entirely reasonable and justified, given also the extent of the injuries sustained by the present victim.

45     I also note that last month on 8 July 2019, Parliament passed amendments to the RTA to streamline irresponsible driving offences into two broad types of offences i.e dangerous driving and careless driving. The penalties are also increased for both types of offences to deter bad driving behaviour. The severity of punishment corresponds to four levels of harm caused i.e. death (being the most severe), grievous hurt, hurt and no hurt (least severe). While these amendments would not apply to the present offence, the manner in which the new offences will be categorised reinforces my view that the degree of culpability and the level of harm caused would be material factors to be considered to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the present offence.

46     In terms of culpability, I considered that the victim had the right of way and was already half-way across the junction. Despite this, the accused did not give way to the victim but made the discretionary turn and collided head-on into the victim’s motor-cycle. He did not even slow down when he ploughed into the victim. The impact was so great that it spun the motor-cycle 180 degrees and caused the victim to fly up into the air and across the entire length of the accused’s car before landing behind the car. It was entirely fortuitous that the victim’s injuries were not more serious.

47     In terms of harm caused, although there were no fractures, the injuries sustained by the victim were certainly extensive (i.e. all over the body including the head), permanent (i.e. scarring on the hands) and would have amounted to grievous hurt (i.e. hospitalisation and outpatient medical leave exceeding three months). Therefore, the level of harm caused may be considered at least moderate if not bordering on high. I also considered that the potential for greater harm was also bordering on high. The collision was no doubt a bad one and as I stated earlier, it was entirely fortuitous that the victim’s injuries were not more serious. In fact, the collision looked so bad that initially, the accused and the witness thought that the victim might have died.[^28]

#### Lack of Remorse

48     The accused claimed trial to the charge. As noted above, the accused obstinately refused to accept or acknowledge that he was wrong, not even in the slightest. In fact, he was so miffed when he was convicted that he did not bother to mitigate even when he was invited repeatedly to do so. He also proclaimed indignantly (even before the sentence was pronounced on him) that he was going to appeal against his conviction to the highest court. Therefore, he did not deserve any discount in the sentence which might have been given had he pleaded guilty.

49     More alarmingly, the accused absolutely lacked insight into his offence. He does not seem to appreciate the fact that he had knocked down and could easily have killed the victim. He showed no shame, regret, guilt or contrition. On the contrary and therefore adding insult to injury, he blamed and continues to blame the victim for colliding into him. Perhaps what is equally if not more dangerous than his manner of driving is the fact that the accused continues to refuse to accept the undeniable truth that he must give way to oncoming traffic. If he maintains that attitude every time he gets behind the wheel, he will pose a danger to other road users. For that added reason, I completely agree with the prosecution that a significant period of disqualification is justified to keep the accused off the roads until he accepts his guilt and learns how to drive in a safe manner.

#### Conduct of defence deplorable

50     In addition to the highly disparaging and derisive remarks made by the accused in his submission, I also considered that he had conducted his defence in a most deplorable manner. The accused showed himself to be dismissive, abusive and argumentative when he cross-examined the prosecution witnesses. The fact that he was in person and not represented by counsel is certainly no excuse. The court had advised and reminded him to ask his questions or state his case in a civil and calm manner. However, the court’s advice and instructions mostly fell on deaf ears. Whilst he was generally respectful when addressing the court, he was otherwise boorish and rude to everyone else. In truth, the way he conducted his defence is reflective of the way he drove and committed the offence.

### Conclusion - Sentence

51     I considered and agree with the sentencing submission made by the prosecution. I also considered that the accused was unremorseful and unrepentant. He had conducted his defence in an unnecessarily abrasive manner and also cast unwarranted aspersions on the prosecution and its witnesses. Applying the sentencing principles of deterrence and prevention and having regard to all the circumstances of the present offence and the offender, the accused is fined $5,000 (in default to serve five weeks’ imprisonment). I further ordered that the accused be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving license for all classes of vehicles for a period of 2 years.

52     I am of the view that the quantum of fine and the length of disqualification are justified, appropriate and proportionate given the culpability of the accused and the extent of the injuries caused to the victim.
