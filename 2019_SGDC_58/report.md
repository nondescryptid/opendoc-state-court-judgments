\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9049/2019/01\]

1 April 2019

### District Judge Adam Nakhoda:

Mr Tay Tong Chuan (“Mr Tay”) pleaded guilty to an offence under section 204A read with section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) of abetting by instigating another person to intentionally obstruct the course of justice. He also pleaded guilty to an offence of negligently doing an act which endangered the safety or another person under section 15(3A) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Cap 354A) (“WSHA”). I sentenced Mr Tay to eight weeks’ imprisonment for each charge and ordered the sentences to run consecutively.

2       The Prosecution being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed for the offence under section 204A read with section 116[^1] of the Penal Code has appealed. This Grounds of Decision will be confined to my reasons for imposing a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment for the section 204A read with section 116 Penal Code offence.

3       Mr Tay, through his Defence Counsel, Mr Ernest Sia (“Mr Sia”), informed the Court that he intended to commence serving his sentence immediately. However, the Deputy Public Prosecutor, Mr Kumaresan Gohulabalan (“Mr Gohulabalan”) applied for the Court to order a stay of the commencement of sentence of imprisonment as the Prosecution intended to appeal against the sentence. Mr Gohulabalan submitted that the case was not suitable for an expedited appeal as the Prosecution required time to put up detailed submissions to the High Court in order to canvass all the relevant considerations and that this case may lead to the High Court establishing a sentencing benchmark for section 204A Penal Code offences. Mr Gohulabalan submitted that as the Prosecution was seeking an additional eight weeks’ sentence there was a possibility that if Mr Tay commenced his sentence on 28 February 2019, he was likely to have served his sentence by the time the appeal was heard. Mr Gohulabalan argued that this would be prejudicial to the Prosecution.

4       Mr Sia, objected to the Prosecution’s application for a stay. He informed the Court that Mr Tay had made arrangements to take leave from work in order to serve his sentence. Having considered the submissions, I granted the Prosecution’s application for a stay. I noted that after the accused was sentenced he had been brought down to the State Court’s lock-up at approximately 2.45 p.m. and he has spent approximately two hours and twenty minutes in the lock-up before the application for the stay was granted.

5       Mr Tay is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.

**PROCEEDED CHARGES**

_DCN 900028 of 2018_ (“**first offence**”)

_You, are charged that you, on 9 June 2016, at about 11.15 a.m., at 6 Kranji Lane, Singapore 728641 (the “workplace”), did abet by instigating one Mamun (FIN: xxx) to intentionally obstruct the course of justice, to wit, by asking the said Mamun to take the blame for a fatal workplace accident that resulted in the death of one Arumugam Elango (FIN: xxx) which occurred on 9 June 2016 at about 10.45 a.m. at the workplace when the said Mamun had not caused the said fatal workplace accident, which offence was not committed by the said Mamun in consequence of your abetment, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 204A read with section 116 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)._

_DCN 900419 of 2018_

_You, are charged that you, on or about 9 June 2016, being the Site Supervisor of Zap Piling Pte Ltd (UEN: xxx) at a storage yard located at 6 Kranji Link Singapore 728641 (the “Premises”), which was a workplace within the meaning of the Workplace Safety and Health Act (Chapter 354A, 2009 Ed) (the Act“), did without reasonable cause, negligently do an act which endangered the safety of others, to wit, you carried out lifting operation involving a crawler crane at the Premises without a permit-to-work and a lifting plan, thereby endangering the safety of everyone involved in the lifting operation and resulting in the death of Arumugam Elango (FIN: xxx), and you have thereby committed an offence under s 15(3A)._

## THE FACTS

6       Mr Tay admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. Mr Tay was employed as a Site Supervisor by Zap Piling Pte Ltd (“Zap Piling”). On 6 June 2016, one of Zap Piling’s directors, Mr Tay Tong Tham instructed Mr Tay to perform a functional tests of a bore piling machine at Zap Piling’s premises. The functional tests involved using the bore piling machine to dig four holes using an auger. A boring bucket would then be placed inside the hole to prevent it from collapsing. In addition to Mr Tay, a number of employees from Zap Piling were involved in the functional test. In particular, Mr Arumugam Elango (“Mr Elango”), Mr Sumon A B M (“Mr Sumon”) and Mr Mamun assisted Mr Tay in carrying out the tests.

7       The functional tests commenced on 7 June 2016 and continued every day till 9 June 2016. Each time the tests were carried out Mr Tay was the supervisor overseeing the operation. On 9 June, Mr Tay decided to shift a boring bucket weighing 4.95 tonnes from one location at Zap Piling’s premises to another location. Mr Tay instructed a worker to use a crawler crane to lift the boring bucket and move it to the new location.

8       To move the boring bucket to the new location, the crawler crane operator had to manoeuvre the crawler crane along a narrow path that was flanked in parts by bore pile casings that had been stacked unsecured in a pyramidal fashion. During this movement, Mr Elango and placed himself in a space between the bore piling machine and a stack of bore pile casings. Unfortunately, as the crawler crane operator was attempting to place the boring bucket besides some bore pile casings, the boring bucket knocked against the loose bore piling casings causing some of the casings to cascade to the ground. Mr Elango was pinned between the bore piling casings and the bore piling machine. The casings weighed approximately 1.76 tonnes each. Mr Elango succumbed to the injuries he sustained as a result.

9       As stated above, Mr Tay was the supervisor overseeing the functional tests. Apart from being given the instructions on the task to be carried out, he did not receive any instruction on the safety aspects of the task nor did he seek any information regarding the safety aspects. As the operation to move the boring bucket from one location to another was a lifting operation there was a requirement that Mr Tay apply for a permit-to-work (“PTW”) in conjunction with a lifting plan.

10     The PTW would have ensured that appropriate safety measures were in place prior to the lifting operation commencing and issues like the risk of collision between the boring bucket and other obstructions along the route of movement could have been addressed and managed. The lifting plan would also have ensured that control measures to minimise dangers and maximise the safety aspects of the lifting operation were in place. By failing to ensure that a PTW was applied for and a lifting plan established and implemented, Mr Tay had committed a negligent act that resulted in the death of Mr Elango.

11     After the fatal accident, Mr Tay informed Zap Piling’s plant manager, Mr Yong Yoong Kwong about the accident. In response to Mr Yoong’s queries, Mr Tay said that he had not witnessed the accident. It was at this point, approximately 30 minutes after the accident that Mr Yong and Mr Tay decided to persuade Mr Mamun to accept the blame for the accident. During the operation to move the boring bucket, Mr Mamun had been sitting in the cab of an excavator with its digging arm extended. His job that day was to remove soil after the functional tests had been conducted. Mr Mamun was not involved in the operation to move the boring bucket.

12     At 11.15 a.m. on 9 June 2016, Mr Mamun and Mr Sumon were called to the store area, where Mr Tay “_coached Mamun to say that the excavator he was in control of had touched the casings and that the casings had collapsed to the ground and hit the Deceased_”. However, Mamun refused to take the blame for the accident. Mr Mamun had also covertly recorded his conversation with Mr Tay and Mr Yong and he would subsequently be exonerated when he gave the recordings to MOM.

13     Mr Mamun was charged on 17 July 2017 with an offence under section 304A(b) Penal Code[^2] of causing the death of Mr Elango by a negligent act[^3]. He was subsequently charged on 28 August 2018 with an offence under section 15(3A) WSHA[^4]. The basis for Mr Mamun being charged were false statements given by Mr Sumon to the police and the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) where he stated that he had seen Mr Mamun’s excavator hitting the boring bucket which in turn hit the bore pile casings causing them to collapse to the ground. Mr Sumon subsequently informed MOM that he had not witnessed how the accident had happened and that his earlier statements were false. Mr Sumon said that he “_had made the false statements only because Yong had also asked him to do so. He complied with Yong’s instructions out of fear of losing his job_”.

14     Mr Tay admitted that he had neither witnessed the accident nor reasonably believed that Mr Mamun was responsible for the accident. Mr Tay also admitted that he knew that the relevant authorities would investigated the accident and that he had intended to obstruct the course of justice by directing blame for the accident to Mr Mamun, so that he and Zap Piling would not be investigated following the accident. Mr Tay admitted that by asking Mr Mamun to take the blame for the accident he had abetted the offence of intentionally obstructing the course of justice.

## ANTECEDENTS

15     Mr Tay had no previous convictions.

## LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS AND PRESCRIBED PUNISHMENT

16     The relevant provisions are section 204A and 116 Penal Code:

**204A**.    Whoever intentionally obstructs, prevents, perverts or defeats the course of justice shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, or with fine, or with both.

**116**.    Whoever abets and offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence is not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence, or with fine as is provided for that offence, or with both; and if the abettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with fine as is provided for that offence, or with both.

17     In the present case the maximum sentence of imprisonment is one year and nine months, or fine, or both.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION

18     Mr Gohulabalan sought a sentence of four months’ imprisonment for the section 204A Penal Code offence. Mr Gohulabalan submitted that instead of taking responsibility for his lapses in ensuring that the movement of the boring bucket was carried out in a safe manner, Mr Tay had “_attempted to persuade Mamun_” to take the blame for the accident. Mr Gohulabalan submitted that but for Mr Mamun’s presence of mind to record the conversation he had with Mr Tay and Mr Yong, Mr Mamun would have been wrongfully convicted and would have faced a significant term of imprisonment.

19     Mr Gohulabalan submitted that deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle as such offences “_contaminate the law_”. He submitted that the sentence should increase proportionally with the severity of the predicate offence[^5]. In the present case, Mr Tay had tried to shield himself and Zap Piling from prosecution and pin the blame on Mamun. The predicate offence that Mr Tay had committed was one under section 15(3A) WSHA. Mr Gohulabalan submitted that, based on precedents, a sentence in the region of 10 weeks’ imprisonment would have been imposed on Mr Tay for the section 15(3A) offence.

20     Mr Gohulabalan tendered a table of sentencing precedents:

a.      _Seah Hock Thiam v Public Prosecutor_: the accused person had abetted by instigating a Mohamad Azmi bin Abdul Wahab to get two other persons to assume criminal liability for two persons, Ho Ah Huat and Ong Pang Aik, who had committed traffic offences. The accused was convicted after trial and sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. The sentence was reduced on appeal to one weeks’ imprisonment.

b.      _Public Prosecutor v Li Na_ [^6] : the accused had imported counterfeit goods into Singapore for sale. When she was detained at Changi Airport, she contacted two accomplices and asked them to remove counterfeit goods from her shop as she was afraid that the police would raid her shop. She was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.

c.      _Public Prosecutor v Lee Kong Kean[^7]_: the accused was a regular in the Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) and was the exercise-coordinator of an SAF exercise. The accused asked the co-accused to drive a military jeep even though he knew that the co-accused did not possess the requisite license. Whilst driving the jeep, the co-accused misjudged a bend and as a result lost control of the jeep. The jeep overturned and a serviceman who was sitting in the jeep was thrown out and then pinned by the jeep. The serviceman died as a result of his injuries. After the exercise the accused gathered the other exercise instructors and informed them that he intended to say that the deceased had stolen the vehicle. The other instructors rejected his suggestion and the accused did not proceed. The accused was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment.

d.      _Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v Public Prosecutor[^8]_: the accused, a police officer, had deliberately caused a recorded confession to disappear with the intention of screening another person from punishment for an offence of possession of a controlled drug. The accused claimed trial to an offence under section 201 Penal Code and was convicted after trial and sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.

e.      _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nur Fatwa Adighazali[^9]_: the deceased, an SCDF National Serviceman, drowned after he was pushed into a 12 meter deep well by the accused. The co-accused had taken a video of the incident. The accused then instigated the co-accused to delete the video knowing he that video captured the incident and that it would be relevant to investigations. The co-accused deleted the footage but it was subsequently recovered from his mobile phone.

21     Mr Gohulabalan argued that Mr Tay’s culpability was greater than accused persons in all the precedents. The accused persons in the precedent cases were either (i) seeking to eradicate evidence of their or someone else’s wrongdoing; or (ii) asking others to assume criminal liability voluntarily. In the present case, Mr Tay had diverted the blame to Mamun, who was an innocent party and would have faced a sentence of at least 10 weeks’ imprisonment for the section 15(3A) WSHA he was charged with. It was further submitted that after Mr Mamun was implicated by Mr Sumon, Mr Tay did not inform the police or MOM that Mr Tay had been wrongly prosecuted.

22     Mr Gohulabalan also justified a sentence of four months’ imprisonment by drawing a parallel to _Lee Kong Kean._ In that case, the accused was charged attempted obstruction of justice as he did not follow through with his suggestion to his fellow instructors to lie to the police that the deceased had stolen the jeep. In addition, the predicate offence in _Lee Kong Kean_ was committing a rash act under section 336(a) Penal Code, for which the maximum sentence was lower than the current predicate offence under section 15(3A) WSHA.

## MITIGATION

23     Mr Sia urged me to impose a fine of $7,000 for the section 204A charge. Mr Sia submitted that Mr Tay had not threatened, coerced or offered to pay Mr Mamun to accept the blame for the accident. After Mr Mamun had refused to take the blame, Mr Tay had not pressed the issue.

24     Mr Sia also submitted that even if Mr Tay had been successful in getting Mr Mamun to accept fault, Mr Tay would not have necessarily avoided liability as he was the site supervisor and was responsible for the safety of the operation regardless.

25     Mr Sia tendered a table of sentencing precedents[^10]:

a.      _Public Prosecutor v Ng Ang Heng[^11]_: a Xu Yajie, the human resources head of a transportation company, had claimed trial to an offence of permitting an employee of the company to drive a bus without a vocational licence. The accused and another former employee of the company, Xu Xiaona, had been called as Prosecution witnesses. The accused had then attempted to pervert the course of justice by sending SMS messages to Xu Yajie and Xu Xiaona for them to give evidence during the trial that the accused made the final decision on the hiring of drivers for the company. Xu Yajie and Xu Xiaona did not testify the accused had requested. The accused was fined $6000 for the section 204A read with section 511 Penal Code offence.

The District Judge in arriving at his decision on sentence found that the predicate offences for which Xu Yajie was tried was not particularly serious and would ordinarily be punished with a fine. He also found that the accused had not threatened, coerced or induced Xu Yajie or Xu Xiaona with payment to give the evidence he wanted. There was also no evidence to suggest that the evidence that the accused wanted the witness to testify to was untrue. The District Judge also found that the harm caused by the accused’s attempt to influence the testimony of the witnesses was low.

b.      _Public Prosecutor v Subramaniam Gopalan[^12]_: the accused had been involved in a road traffic accident and it was observed by the other driver that the accused may be under the influence of alcohol. The accused left the scene. About four hours later police went to the accused’s home to interview him. He was observed by the police officers to be intoxicated. A police officer requested that the accused take a breathalyser test, however, the accused refused, shut and locked his front door. It took the police two and half hours to cut the lock and arrest the accused. During that time the accused consumed alcohol in front of the police.

The accused was charged with intentionally perverting the course of justice by consuming alcohol after being informed by a police officer that he may be placed under arrest for drink driving with the intention of diminishing the accuracy of any breath or blood tests subsequently taken from him.

Having perused sentencing precedents, the District Judge found that a custodial sentence was the norm for section 204A Penal Code offences that involved destruction of evidence. In view of the accused persons blatant conduct in destroying evidence (by consuming alcohol) in full view of the police and the seriousness of the predicate offence, a drink-driving offence, the District Judge sentenced the accused to four months’ imprisonment.

26     I found that the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Tay Su Ann[^13]_ and _PP v Lim Ah Hwa_ were not relevant to the present case as in those cases there were exceptional mitigating factors that warranted fines instead of sentences of imprisonment. In _Tay Su Ann_, the accused was diagnosed with major depressive disorder that was a contributing factor to the commission of the offence, she was relatively young and it was accepted that imprisonment was likely to worsen her condition. In _Lim Ah Hwa_, on appeal her sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment was reduced to a fine of $5000 in part as she was a single mother taking care of three daughters.

## DECISION

## A.    Primary sentencing consideration

27     In the Commentary section on section 204A Penal Code in the chapter relating to Offences Against Administration of Justice in the _Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts[^14]_, it was stated that “\[_i_\]_n the Parliamentary Reports dated 22 October 2007, the intention of the new enactment_ \[i.e. of section 204A\] _was stated as thus:_

_Amendments to enhance the course of justice_

_… We are introducing a new s 204A to plug the gaps arising from the general offence of perverting the course of justice, which can be committed in various ways. The new s. 204A will plug this gap. Situations covered include deliberately assisting a person to evade lawful arrest; destroying or falsifying evidence, whether or not legal proceedings have already been instituted or pleading guilty to an offence committed by another person, in order to shield that other person … ”_

28     The authors of the _Sentencing Practice_ went on to opine that “_\[u\]ndoubtedly, the sentencing philosophy underpinning the commission of such offences would be that of general deterrence. Offences under s 204A of the Penal Code are offences against the institutions of justice and they contaminate the rule of law. For this reason, the ‘default’ starting sentence for an offence under s 204A of the Penal Code should be a custodial one.”_

29     It is clear from this passage that as such offences are “_against the institutions of justice and the contaminate the rule of law_”, the primary sentencing consideration is general deterrence. I also agreed with the principle espoused by the Court of Appeal in England in _R v Andrew[^15]_ where it was held that with regards to offences of obstructing the course of justice “_there are few more serious offences possible in the present day, if one excludes violent offences, than those which tend to distort the course of public justice and prevent the Courts from producing true and just results in the cases before them_”.

30     Therefore, I was fully in agreement with Mr Gohulabalan’s submission that the primary sentencing consideration for offences involving section 204A Penal Code must be general deterrence. Whilst a fine may be a sufficiently deterrent sentence in some situations, for the present offence the starting point should be a custodial sentence, unless there are exceptional mitigating circumstances. This was also apparent from the precedent cases.

## B.    Applicable principles when sentencing offences under section 204A

31     In _Seah Hock Thiam v Public Prosecutor_, two people, Mr Ong and Mr Ho, had committed traffic offences. The Traffic Police had served, on the registered owners of the respective vehicles, a request for the particulars of the parties who were driving the vehicles at the time of the offences. The Traffic Police received replies that a Mr Salami and Mr Rosniwati had driven the vehicles. These two persons had been engaged by a Mr Mohamad Azmi to take the place of Mr Ong and Mr Ho. Mr Mohamed Azmi was the personal driver of the appellant. The Appellant was convicted after trial of two offences under section 204A read with section 109 and was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment per charge.

32     In assessing the principles to be applied in determining the appropriate sentence, Justice Choo Han Teck held, at \[8\]:

_“8_      _… Thus, in determining the extent of the wrongdoing, the nature of the principal’s offence is relevant. The more serious it is, the more serious the act of perverting the course of justice will be in relation to it.”_

33     Therefore, the sentencing Court has to have reference to the seriousness of the predicate offence in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the section 204A Penal Code offence

34     In _Public Prosecutor v Pek Siew Gek and Tang Yudong[^16]_, the accused persons had claimed trial to offences under section 204A read with section 116 Penal Code. In considering the appropriate sentence, the District Judge summarised the Prosecution’s submissions on the factors that would affect culpability, he stated, at \[84\], that these factors were:

_“(i_)     _The gravity of the predicate matter in which justice was sought to be obstructed;_

(_ii_)   _The manner in which justice was sought to be obstructed;_

(_iii_)   _The duration of the misconduct, including whether the offender ceased his conduct at an early stage, or voluntarily disclosed his misconduct;_

(_iv_)   _The potential for harm that could arise from the misconduct;_

(_v_)     _Whether and how the offender stood to gain from obstructing justice.”_

35     The District Judge, at \[106\] agreed and accepted the Prosecution’s submissions on the determination of an offender’s culpability. For the present case, I would similarly endorse the factors listed above in the determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr Tay.

### I.    The gravity of the predicate offence

36     The predicate offence that Mr Tay had committed was an offence under section 15(3A) WSHA. Under section 15(3A) an offender is liable to a maximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment, a maximum fine of $30,000 or a combination of both. If Mr Mamun had taken the blame for causing the accident, he could have been charged and convicted with an offence under section 15(3A) and/or an offence under section 304A(b) Penal Code, and, having perused the Mr Mamun’s case file, I noted that he had been charged with these offences.

37     Therefore, Mr Tay’s act of trying to persuade Mr Mamun to accept the blame had potentially dual consequences, it may have shielded Mr Tay from prosecution for the section 15(3A) WSHA offence and resulted in Mr Mamun being charged and, possibly, convicted for offences under both section 304A(b) Penal Code and section 15(3A). However, as I will explain below, the fact that Mr Mamun was charged for these offences in not attributable to Mr Tay’s attempt to obstruct the course of justice, rather to Mr Yong persuading Mr Sumon to furnish false statements to the police and MOM. Therefore, I in considering the sentence to be imposed on Mr Tay, I placed less weight on the fact that Mr Mamun had in fact been charged for offences in connection with the accident.

38     Mr Sia submitted that even if Mr Tay had succeeded in persuading Mr Mamun to accept fault for the accident this would not necessarily have meant that Mr Tay would have avoided liability as Mr Tay was the supervisor. I agreed with Mr Gohulabalan’s submission that this was speculative because there was no way of telling what offence Mr Mamun would have agreed to, in addition, Mr Tay admitted to the Statement of Facts, which stated, at \[23\], that Mr Tay “_…knew that the relevant authorities would investigate the accident and intended to obstruct the course of justice by directing blame for the accident to Mamum, so that_ **_he and the Company would not be investigated for offences following the accident_**_”_ \[Emphasis mine\].

39     In his submissions, Mr Gohulabalan, had stated that “_Tay was trying to eradicate evidence of any wrongdoing by himself_ **_and his company_** _and instead, sought to pin the blame on Mamun_” \[Emphasis mine\]. I agreed that in the present case, Mr Tay was also trying to shield Zap Piling from possible prosecution. Zap Piling faced a potential charge under section 12(1) WSHA, which carries a maximum fine of $500,000. Zap Piling was eventually charged with an offence under section 12(1) read with section 20 and punishable under section 50(b) WSHA and was fined $290,000 for the offence.

40     I found that the possible charge against Zap Piling was an additional predicate offence that should be considered in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed against Mr Tay.

41     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that the predicate offences, with regards to both Mr Tay and Zap Piling, were serious offences. In addition, I found that the circumstances of the offence related to an industrial accident that resulted in the death of a worker. Prosecution of the company, Zap Piling, and the errant supervisor, Mr Tay, have a dual purpose. First, obviously, is to punish and deter the offenders, second, and in my opinion, as important, is the necessity of educating both the offending company and other companies in this line of the unsafe conditions that could give rise to such accidents. Had Mr Mamun taken the blame and successfully shielded the company from liability then the dangerous circumstances at Zap Piling’s premises that gave rise to the accident may not have been rectified.

42     I found that the predicate offences in _Seah Hock Thiam_ and in _Ng Ang Heng_, which were relatively minor traffic offences, were far less serious than the predicate offences in the present case. As such, I did not think these precedents were instructive.

43     In _Subramaniam Gopalan_, the predicate offence was drink-driving, which is a serious traffic offence and which can attract a custodial sentence, even for first timers, when they are also involved in a road traffic accident. I found that the predicate offences in the present case were more serious than in _Subramaniam Gopalan._

44     In _Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh_ the predicate offence that the accused was attempting to shield another person from was an offence of possession of a controlled drug. I found that the predicate offence in _Abdul Salam_ was more serious than in the present case. In addition, there were other aggravating factors in _Abdul Salam_ which would distinguish that case from the present case. As such I found that Mr Tay’s sentence should be less than the sentence imposed on the accused in _Abdul Salam_.

45     In _Lee Kong Kean_ the predicate offence, that the accused was trying to avoid prosecution for, was an offence of doing a rash act that endangered the human life of another under section 336(a) Penal Code. The accused, knowing that his co-accused, did not possess the requisite military license had directed the co-accused to drive the jeep. When the jeep overturned, due to the co-accused misjudging a bend, a passenger in the rear of the jeep was killed. The accused had tried to implicate the deceased as being the driver of the jeep as the deceased had tried to steal it.

46     Although, the maximum punishment for an offence under section 336(a) Penal Code, i.e. six months’ imprisonment, is less than the maximum sentence for offences under section 15(3A) WSHA, I nonetheless found the predicate offence in _Lee Kong Kean_ was closest to the present case. The predicate offence, committed in the manner that it was by the accused in _Lee Kong Kean_ was likely to result in a lengthy custodial sentence and in fact the accused was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for the section 336(a) Penal Code offence.

47     I noted that at the time that Mr Tay committed the 204A offence, i.e. in 2016, the usual sentences for offences under section 15(3A) were fines. As was pointed out by Justice Chan Seng Onn in _Nurun Novi v. Public Prosecutor[^17]_, at \[69\] “_… in relation to offences charged under section 15(3A) WSHA that have resulted in death. The provision was enacted seven years ago and there have been at least 17 such fatal accident cases since the enactment of the provision. Despite, this there has not been a single case where a custodial sentence has been imposed for a s 15(3A) offence_”.

48     Whilst a sentence of ten weeks’ imprisonment for a section 15(3A) offence may be appropriate after the decision in _Nurun Novi_, it was by no means a likely sentence at the time when Mr Tay committed the current offence. Therefore, having balanced the fact that the maximum sentence for a section 15(3A) offence is higher than one under section 336(a) with the fact that a custodial sentence was far more likely in a section 336(a) offence when compared to a section 15(3A) offence (committed in 2016), I found that the predicate offence in _Lee Kong Kean_ was as serious as the predicate offence in the present case.

### II.    The manner and duration of the misconduct

49     In the present case, Mr Tay had attempted to obstruct the course of justice by pinning the blame for the accident on an innocent party. I agree with Mr Gohulabalan’s categorisation of section 204A offenders into two classes, (i) offenders who seek to obstruct the course of justice by eradicating evidence of their own wrongdoing or that of others; and (ii) offenders who ask others to assume criminal liability voluntarily.

50     Mr Tay had attempted to divert the blame for the accident to Mr Mamun, who was an innocent party. However, Mr Tay had, in effect, asked Mr Mamun to voluntarily take the blame for the accident. I am in agreement with Mr Sia’s submission that Mr Tay neither threatened nor coerced Mr Mamun into assuming blame for the accident. Mr Tay had also not tried to offer a financial incentive to Mr Mamun if he agreed to take the blame. If Mr Tay had threatened, coerced or offered a financial incentive to Mamun to take the blame, these would have been aggravating factors which would have resulted in a stiffer sentence imposed on Mr Tay.

51     The Statement of Facts also disclosed that Mr Tay, along with Mr Yong, had attempted to persuade Mr Mamun to take the blame for the accident on only one occasion, almost immediately after the accident had occurred. Once Mr Mamun refused to take the blame, there were no further attempts by Mr Tay to persuade Mr Mamun.

52     In terms of the manner of the misconduct, I found that the lowest level of culpability can be seen in the case of _Ng Ang Heng_. In that case the accused had not sought a benefit for himself, he was not trying to shield himself from prosecution, he had not threatened, coerced or paid the court witnesses and, most importantly, he had asked the witnesses to testify to facts that he subjectively believed to be true. The present case is more egregious that _Ng Ang Heng_, because Mr Tay was attempting to shield himself and Zap Piling from prosecution and he was asking Mr Mamun to accept the blame for the accident when he knew that this was not true.

53     However, I found that Mr Tay’s culpability, in terms of the manner of the misconduct was not as egregious as the culpability of the accused in _Lee Kong Kean_. The accused in _Lee Kong Kean_ had attempted to push the blame to the deceased victim, a wholly innocent person. I found that the accused person’s conduct was worse than Mr Tay’s because he was pushing the blame to a person who was incapable of refuting the allegation. This would have led to the deceased’s reputation being besmirched by the false allegation. Mr Tay, on the other hand, had sought to persuade Mr Mamun to voluntarily accept the blame.

54     I also found that the manner in which the accused in _Subramaniam Gopalan_ had obstructed the course of justice was different to the present case as the accused in that case was not trying to get someone else to take the blame for the predicate offence, rather he was trying to obliterate evidence of the predicate offence.

55     Nonetheless I found that accused’s actions in _Subramaniam Gopalan_ was far more egregious than Mr Tay’s actions, as the accused had locked himself in his home and refused to open his door thus preventing the police, for two and a half hours, from arresting him sooner and subjecting him to a breathalyser or blood test closer in time to when he had consumed alcohol. He also had the temerity to drink more alcohol in the presence of the police in an apparent attempt to disguise any alcohol he had drunk earlier in the day with post-driving drinking.

56     I found that the duration of Mr Tay’s misconduct as a result of his attempt to persuade Mr Mamun to accept the blame was not long. In fact, the duration was for the extent of the conversation that Mr Tay had with Mr Mamun shortly after the accident. As Mr Mamun did not agree to take the blame and Mr Tay did not press the issue, Mr Tay’s attempt to obstruct the course of justice ended with Mr Mamun’s refusal.

57     It is a fact that Mr Mamun was subsequently charged with offences relating to the accident but this prosecution was **not** the result of Mr Tay’s attempt to obstruct the course of justice. I will deal with this in more detail below.

58     However, Mr Tay must have been aware that Mr Mamun had been charged with offences connected with the accident and he knew that this should not be the case as Mr Mamun was not responsible in any way for the accident. I would agree with Mr Gohulabalan’s submission that Mr Tay was obliged to inform the authorities that they had charged the wrong person. I found that Mr Tay’s failure to inform the authorities that they had charged the wrong person increased his level of culpability.

### III.    Potential for harm, gain and actual harm

59     The potential for harm from Mr Tay’s attempt to persuade Mr Mamun to accept blame have been canvassed above. Had Mr Mamun taken the blame for the accident, he faced a potential conviction for offences under section 15(3A) WSHA and/or section 304A(b) Penal Code. Mr Mamun may have had to pay a hefty fine (or possibly been imprisoned) and may have faced repatriation to his home country. There was an obvious gain to be had by Mr Tay and, possibly, by Zap Piling as they may have avoided prosecution. As stated above, the other potential harm that may have arisen was that the safety failings by both Mr Tay and Zap Piling may not have been addressed, potentially leading to further workplace accidents in the future.

60     In this case, there was actual harm to Mr Mamun. Despite refusing the to take the blame for the accident, Mr Mamun was nonetheless charged for offences under section 15(3A) WSHA and section 304A(b) Penal Code. However, it was clear from the Statement of Facts, that Mr Tay was in no way responsible for Mr Mamun being charged. Mr Mamun was charged because Mr Yong had told Mr Sumon to make false statements to MOM and the police to implicate Mr Mamun. Mr Sumon had made the false statements because he feared that he would lose his job. Therefore, the direct reason why Mr Mamun was charged was attributable to Mr Yong’s and Mr Sumon’s acts **not** to Mr Tay’s attempt to obstruct the course of justice.

61     As stated above, Mr Tay, once he was aware that Mr Mamun had been charged with offences in connection with the accident, obligation was to inform the authorities that Mr Mamun was innocent and his failure to do so has increased his culpability for his offence. However, blame should not be ascribed to Mr Tay for the fact that Mr Mamun was charged with offences as Mr Tay had nothing to do with persuading Mr Sumon.

### C.    Sentence

62     I found that _Lee Kong Kean_ was the closest case to the present case in terms of the accused person’s culpability. In summary, though I found gravity of the predicate offences, in terms of the maximum punishment, in the current case was more severe that in _Lee Kong Kean_, having taken into account the likely sentences that may have been imposed, at the time of the accident, for an offence under section 15(3A) WSHA and for an offence under section 336(a) Penal Code, I felt that the seriousness of the predicate offenses in both cases was similar. However, I also noted that Mr Tay’s obstruction of justice would have also had the effect of possibly shielding Zap Piling from prosecution for an offence under section 12(1) WHSA.

63     In terms of the manner of the attempt to obstruct the course of justice, I found that the accused in _Lee Kong Kean_ was more culpable because he was attempting to push the blame to the deceased, whereas, Mr Tay was merely trying to persuade Mr Mamun to voluntarily take the blame. I also noted that the accused in _Lee Kong Kean_ was a public servant and an attempt to obstruct the course of justice by a public servant would be an aggravating factor. Finally, I found that the potential for harm from the offence in the present case and in _Lee Kong Kean_ was similar. Having balanced the factors in both _Lee Kong Kean_ and the current case, I found that Mr Tay’s overall culpability was similar to the accused in _Lee Kong Kean_.

64     I found that the culpability of the accused persons in _Subramaniam Gopalan_ and in _Abdul Salam bin Mohamed_ were greater than Mr Tay’s culpability. I have addressed the culpability of accused in _Subramaniam Gopalan_ above. The accused in _Abdul Salam bin Mohamed_ was a police officer who was a public servant charged with upholding the law. He had deliberately abused his position in order to shield an accused person from prosecution for possession of a controlled drug. As such I found that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment, imposed in both _Subramaniam Gopalan_ and _Abdul Salam bin Mohamed_ was too harsh in view of Mr Tay’s culpability.

65     In deciding on the appropriate sentence I took into account the fact that Mr Tay had pleaded guilty and that he was untraced. In the final analysis, I found that a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment, which was similar to the sentence in _Lee Kong Kean_, would accurately reflect Mr Tay’s culpability. I agreed with Mr Gohulabalan’s submission that the sentences for the section 15(3A) WSHA offence and the section 204A Penal Code should run consecutively for the reasons stated in paragraphs 11 and 12 of his written submissions.
