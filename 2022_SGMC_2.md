Public Order Act, Cap 257A, 2012 Rev. Ed. – whether proof of public disorder or risk thereof required for a prosecution under section 15(2)

7 January 2022

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

1       On 13 December 2018, Mr Jolovan Wham wanted to demonstrate his support for Mr Terry Xu and Mr Daniel De Costa – both of whom were about to face criminal defamation charges. At about 9.09 am that day, Mr Wham arrived at the main entrance to the former State Courts building and took out a sign he prepared. With the State Courts building forming the backdrop, he arranged for a photo to be taken of himself holding up the sign, which read:

> “Drop the charges against Terry Xu and Daniel De Costa”

After that photo was taken, Mr Wham kept the sign and proceeded inside the court building to witness the charging of those two individuals.[^1] Mr Wham later made a public post on his Facebook account where he uploaded that photo of himself, tagged it _#insolidarity_ and provided an update on the outcome of the court mention for those two individuals.[^2] That post drew reactions, shares and comments. The facts recounted thus far are beyond dispute in the Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”).

2       The Prosecution contends that Mr Wham’s actions constitute an assembly which he ought reasonably to know was prohibited by an order under section 12(1) of the Public Order Act (Cap 257A, 2012 Rev Ed) (“POA”), and charged him under section 15(2) of the POA.

3       Mr Wham denied the charge, claimed trial, but offered no evidence and chose to remain silent. Through counsel, he made three main arguments in closing as to why the charge was not made out.[^3] Given that the act was captured on CCTV and Mr Wham’s own photo, the Defence conceded that _actus reus_ (i.e. the guilty act) was proven, but contested that _mens rea_ (i.e. the guilty mind) was unproven. Two other legal arguments were also made. Having objectively reviewed the arguments made by both sides, I found the charge was proven beyond a reasonable doubt and now explain why.

## I – Lacked evidence of a Guilty Mind

4       The first argument advanced by the Defence was that there was nothing before the court to indicate that Mr Wham had the requisite guilty mind.[^4] The Defence argued that it was not reasonable to find that Mr Wham ought to have known that the holding of an assembly at that area was prohibited since even experienced police officers who testified before the court were not familiar with that area being prohibited. I found the reference to the state of knowledge of other persons an unhelpful and irrelevant distraction because only Mr Wham’s knowledge was relevant, and his knowledge was not being measured/imputed with reference to others. In fact, there was evidence before the court as to the state of Mr Wham’s knowledge. I now recount that to explain why the first Defence argument was not tenable.

5       There was undisputed evidence before me that Mr Wham had more than a passing familiarity with the permit regime under the POA because he had submitted several applications over the years to seek official permission to hold various assemblies at various locations for various causes in public.[^5] Out of all those applications, reference need only be made to the details of the last application he submitted to establish the point about the state of his knowledge. That last application was submitted by Mr Wham on 9 November 2018 – about a month before the material date – and it was stated to be a brief assembly to mark “Human Rights Day” on the 10 December 2018. Whilst engaging with the Police on the details of his proposed assembly, Mr Wham indicated that he intended to hold his assembly at the area outside the main entrance to the former State Courts building. In doing so, Mr Wham provided a photo of the proposed area, and this coincided exactly with the area where the present assembly was ultimately carried out by him.[^6] On 5 December 2018, the Police informed Mr Wham that his application to hold his assembly at that area was rejected. It was clear that Mr Wham understood from that outcome that it meant he could not hold the proposed assembly at that area since no permit was granted – this was evident from the fact that he proceeded to submit an appeal against that decision the very next day on 6 December 2018 to the Minister of Home Affairs. In his appeal to the Minister for the permit, he cited the terms of the POA and stated that his proposed “_one person assembly outside the State Courts_” would last “_no more than 5 minutes_” and appealed for approval.[^7] None was given. All this indicated clearly that Mr Wham had (1) more than a passing familiarity with the permit regime in the POA in relation to assemblies; (2) which familiarity included the knowledge that official approval under the POA was required before an assembly could be carried out at the area outside the main entrance to the former State Courts building; and (3) that it remained so even if the proposed assembly was brief and involved only one person. To his credit, there is no evidence that Mr Wham had gone on to mark “Human Rights Day” as intended on the 10 December 2018 in contravention of the outcome of his application.

6       There was however evidence that Mr Wham did hold the present assembly at the exact same location just 3 days later – credit again due to Mr Wham for documenting his actions in the photographic evidence and broadcasting his actions publicly on his Facebook account. Against that backdrop of settled facts, the argument that there was nothing before the court to indicate Mr Wham’s guilty mind rang quite hollow. That backdrop of settled facts indicated that Mr Wham well knew he could not hold an assembly at that area without official permission, even if the proposed assembly was brief, and even if it involved just one person. This was the state of his knowledge shortly before the material date, and before me, nothing was offered by the Defence in evidence to indicate that the status of his knowledge somehow changed in those few days. Indeed, Mr Wham chose to remain silent in the face of the evidence on this area. The inference from the evidence and his position was clear: he knew that a permit was required to hold an assembly at that area, and his decision to hold the present one without even applying for a permit was an act committed with the requisite guilty mind.

7       The finding made here was actual knowledge. I saw no need for the charge to be amended since the finding was higher than the constructive knowledge required in the charge. They were complementary positions, and the Prosecution had submitted on both. The charge as to his state of mind was therefore taken as worded, and this is made clear here in case it affects the parties’ position on sentencing.

## II – Act was not an Assembly

8       The second argument made by the Defence was that the “_act of holding a sign for a few seconds for a quick photoshoot_” does not cross “_the de minimis threshold required to constitute an assembly_” for the purposes of the POA.[^8] The Defence argued that the POA’s permit regime was to maintain public order, and since the present act posed no real or even potential threat to public order, it should not be considered as an assembly requiring permission under the POA. In other words, only acts which disrupt public order or have the potential to disrupt public order should constitute an assembly under section 2 of the POA.[^9] I could not agree with this argument because it plainly requires the court to interpret section 2 with a whole host of additional words which are actually not there on the statute. A review of the POA will establish that there is nothing there which requires a “public order risk” element to be present in an activity before it can constitute an assembly. Statutory interpretation which involves such a marked departure to require proof of an additional criteria which is actually absent from the text is ill-advised without authority, and none was provided as to why the current provision in the present POA (rather than some other section in some previous iteration) deserved such treatment.

9       To recap, Mr Wham’s actions in holding up that sign in front of the main entrance to the former State Courts building clearly demonstrated (1) his support for the views and actions of Mr Terry Xu and Mr Daniel De Costa, and (2) his opposition to the State in prosecuting them for their actions. All those purposes fall squarely within the ambit of what constitutes an assembly under section 2(1)(a) of the POA, which it might be added, prohibits assemblies “by a person alone” acting in demonstration for those purposes. That point is also reiterated in section 3(2) of the POA, and as recounted in the earlier part, it was a point which Mr Wham was also clearly aware of as well. In my judgment, the evidence showed that Mr Wham took part in an assembly within the terms of the POA.

10     I move on to the connected _de minimis_ argument which urges the court to examine the effect of Mr Wham’s actions. It was beyond serious argument that when Mr Wham undertook those actions, he did not appear to seek the attention of anyone nearby at that location as to what he was doing. A CCTV recording was presented in court to show what happened.[^10] That CCTV footage only captured a part of the area outside the main entrance to the former State Courts building. As far as what was captured in the CCTV, it showed that no one in that immediate vicinity paid any particular heed to Mr Wham, his actions, or his message. He and his actions would have passed with no one’s notice, and it would have all been quite pointless, irrelevant, and meaningless – therein lies the nub. Even though Mr Wham did not seek the attention of anyone when he was undertaking those actions, he undoubtedly sought the attention of everyone when he took steps subsequently to broadcast his exploit publicly on his Facebook account that he had taken those demonstrative actions at that location in broad daylight with that message. Relevance returned, and there were reactions aplenty from his thousands of followers with at least 169 liking his actions or expressing their support, several others making comments of support and sharing Mr Wham’s post with yet others.[^11] If the point was always for those actions to matter, to be relevant, to be in the public consciousness so as to sway opinion, reinforce views and advocate for certain positions, then the Defence argument that the review of the effect of his actions should end when the actions stop is completely artificial. In this case, the effect of Mr Wham’s demonstration and his actions in seeking attention to his demonstration made in that manner was more than anything which could be considered as _de minimis_. As a result, this argument failed as well – quite apart from the fact that there was also no legal authority to justify reading a _de minimis_ threshold into the POA either.

11     I end this section with an observation. The Defence argued that the strict interpretation advocated by the Prosecution would result in “_absurdity_” as it meant that individuals wearing t-shirts publicly with slogans advocating a particular position potentially ran afoul of the POA as well.[^12] That sartorial direction appears to be what Mr Wham has since taken to doing as well. In that regard, it really should not come as a surprise if there have been such individuals who were taken to task for those actions in the past, or that there may be others in the future. I would agree though that it would certainly do very little good for every instance to end up in court – more pressing matters await. This is why there are steps in place to ensure balance. Whether certain actions result in a prosecution depends on, amongst others, the Prosecution finding that it is in the public interest to act given the nature, circumstances, and effect of those actions, and that there is evidence available. Whether such a prosecution results in a conviction depends on the separate matter of whether the act is suitably proven, and a court determination that it does indeed contravene the terms of the relevant statute. There was nothing wrong in principle with all of this, and with those steps in place no patent “absurdity” as claimed either.

12     Returning back to the present case, having objectively reviewed the evidence, I found Mr Wham did take part in an assembly under the POA. Any claim that he was being prosecuted for merely taking a photo would be intentionally misleading – rather, this case was for his demonstrating his opposition to the actions of the Attorney-General’s Chambers in prosecuting Mr Terry Xu and Mr Daniel De Costa by publicly holding up that sign in that area which he knew was prohibited. The photo merely constituted evidence of his having taken part in that assembly, and he was not being prosecuted for arranging and supplying that evidence of his wrong-doing.

## III – Charge contravenes Article 14 of the Constitution

13     The final argument made by the Defence was that a conviction on the charge would violate Mr Wham’s Constitutional Right under Article 14(1)(a) which protects his freedom of speech and expression because Mr Wham’s actions posed no real or potential threat to public order.[^13] Leaving aside for the moment whether Mr Wham’s actions constituted speech & expression which had none of those effects, the relevant observation to be made about the Defence argument is that the converse is by implication necessarily true: i.e. if Mr Wham’s actions posed a real or potential threat to public order, then a conviction on the charge would not violate Article 14(1)(a). Indeed, the Defence recognizes this when it concedes that the rights in Article 14(1)(a) are not absolute and unlimited, and may be qualified by Parliament where “… considered necessary or expedient in the interests of \[inter alia\] public order…”.[^14] What the Defence next fails to recognize however is that Parliament has already done so here. Acting through the Minister, Parliament deemed it necessary in the public interest to stipulate by an Order published in the Gazette that the holding of all public assemblies are prohibited in the area outside the main entrance to the former State Courts building.[^15] Having already placed an entirely valid qualifier on Article 14(1)(a) rights in relation to that area, Mr Wham chose to do precisely what was prohibited, and to now advance this wholly untenable argument.

## Conclusion:

14     The qualifier just referred to is meant to help maintain an orderly system for when differences need to be resolved through the courts. We sometimes encounter news about how some court houses end up in disorder because supporters and detractors of a case have chosen to demonstrate their views there. It is neither constructive to the resolution of the case, nor does it advance the cause of rationale rigorous debate when individuals take such reductionist stances that their views should prevail over another without due process. That arrogance does not help the cause of advancement towards a better society when it is precisely due process which helps us all arrive at the most sound arguments. There is no reason due process should be usurped such that Mr Wham’s conclusive views to “_Drop the charges against Terry Xu and Daniel De Costa_” should summarily prevail over that of the Attorney-General. To advocate that, it effectively deprives all the opportunity for independent thought and review.

15     I allude to all this to explain why the present process protects us all – regardless of where our views may be on any particular matter. It is a precious process worth protecting.

16     Having undertaken that process, I found that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Wham’s actions that morning did constitute an assembly, and there was more than enough evidence to conclude that he ought reasonably to have known that the assembly at that area was prohibited. All the elements of the charge in MAC 909273 of 2020 under section 15(2) of the POA were proven, and I accordingly find Mr Wham guilty on the charge and convict him on it.

17     I will now hear parties on sentencing.
