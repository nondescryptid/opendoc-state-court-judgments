\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9109/2019/01.\]

23 May 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

1       Mr Muthukaruppan Periyasamy, an Indian national and Singapore permanent resident currently 52 years of age, worked as a site manager at construction sites. Such sites are inspected by the National Environment Agency (“**NEA**”) and their contractors from time to time to check for mosquito breeding grounds. A site found to be in violation of mosquito breeding controls may be issued a stop work order. From May to August 2018, the defendant paid bribes to two employees of a contractor employed by the NEA. He paid bribes to them amounting to $400 a month in order to receive advance notification from them of any upcoming inspections.

2       The defendant was charged with five counts of giving corrupt gratification, which is an offence under s 6(b) of the _Prevention of Corruption Act_ (Cap 241) (“**PCA**”). On a plea offer by the prosecution he pleaded guilty to two charges, with the remaining three offences taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. On 2 May 2019 he was sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment. He commenced serving the sentence.

3       On 15 May 2019 he filed the present appeal against the sentence. This matter is of much urgency as _the earliest date of the defendant’s release from prison is on 30 May 2019_.

4       The grounds of my decision are set out below.

## PLEA OF GUILT

#### Charges

5       The defendant pleaded guilty to the following two charges:

DAC-901741-2019 (1st Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, on a day in **May 2018**, in Tampines, Singapore, being a site manager of Ramo Industries Pte Ltd and Fenzhii Engineering Services Pte Ltd, did corruptly give gratification of **$400** to Tung Chee Keong and Chandran Jeganathan of Killem Pest Pte Ltd, as a reward for giving you advance notification of inspection by Killem Pest and National Environmental Agency (“NEA”) and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).

DAC-901742-2019 (2nd Charge)

You \[...\] are charged that you, on a day in **June 2018**, in Tampines, Singapore, being a site manager of Ramo Industries Pte Ltd and Fenzhii Engineering Services Pte Ltd, did corruptly give gratification of **$400** to Tung Chee Keong and Chandran Jeganathan of Killem Pest Pte Ltd, as a reward for giving you advance notification of inspection by Killem Pest and National Environmental Agency (“NEA”) and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 241).

#### Facts

6       The defendant was a site manager working for both Fenzhii Engineering Services Pte Ltd and Ramo Industries Pte Ltd (“**Ramo Industries**”). As a site manager, he had to oversee all works and inspections conducted at the construction sites he took charge of. One of the sites was located at Tampines Industrial Street 61 (the “**Tampines Site**”), which was under the purview of Ramo Industries.

7       Inspections were done by the NEA at these sites. The NEA engaged the services of Killem Pest Pte Ltd (“**Killem**”) as a term contractor to assist NEA officers in conducting vector control works. Tung Chee Keong (“**Tung**”) and Chandran Jeganathan (“**Chandran**”) were employed by Killem as Vector Control Workers. Tung and Chandran followed and assisted NEA officers with their inspections at construction sites to look for mosquito breeding grounds (the “**NEA team**”).

8       Between January and April 2018, the NEA team found mosquito breeding grounds on two occasions at the Tampines Site. Penalties were imposed on both occasions, and the defendant was informed that on the occasion of the next violation, a stop work order would be imposed.

9       The defendant then approached Chandran and asked if he could speak with him and Tung together. They agreed. The defendant then met both Tung and Chandran at the basement car park of Block 522C Tampines Central 7 (the “**Tampines car park**”). At this meeting, the defendant offered to give Tung and Chandran $400 each month in return for advance notification of upcoming mosquito breeding inspections at the Tampines Site, so that he could do the necessary housekeeping right before the inspection took place. Tung and Chandran agreed to accept the offer.

10     On 14 May 2018, Chandran informed the defendant that the NEA team would soon arrive at the Tampines Site. About 30 minutes later, the NEA team arrived at the site and conducted their inspection. No violations were discovered. The defendant later met Chandran at the Tampines car park and gave $400 to Chandran to thank him for the advance notification. The money was meant for both Tung and Chandran. (DAC-901741-2019)

11     Similarly, on 6 June 2018, Chandran informed the defendant that the NEA team would soon arrive at the Tampines Site. About 30 minutes later, the NEA team arrived at the Tampines site and conducted their inspection. No violations were discovered. The defendant later met Chandran at the Tampines car park and gave $400 to Chandran to thank him for the advance notification. The money was meant for both Tung and Chandran. (DAC-901742-2019)

12     Between the period of May and August 2018, the defendant gave a total of $1,600 to Tung and Chandran over five occasions (i.e., as reflected in the two proceeded charges and the three charges taken into consideration, below).

### Charges taken into consideration (TIC)

13     Three other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The charges related to bribes paid by the defendant to Tung and Chandran on the following occasions:

(a)     a bribe of $100 in July 2018 (DAC-901743-2019);

(b)     a bribe of $300 in July 2018 (DAC-901744-2019); and

(c)     a bribe of $400 in August 2018 (DAC-901745-2019).

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions

14     In a brief oral submission, the prosecution sought a sentence of at least 6 weeks’ imprisonment for each charge. It was submitted that general deterrence was the primary sentencing objective. The defendant’s conduct posed real public health concerns. His practice of offering bribes was carried on for 4 months prior to CPIB commencing investigations. Both Tung and Chandran had been sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for the mirror charges. Parity in sentencing applied, and the defendant ought likewise to receive a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge.

#### Mitigation Plea

15     In the plea in mitigation, the defence submitted that an appropriate sentence was a high fine. He had no antecedents, and the offences were an “aberration” for the defendant. He was respectful of the law and highly unlikely to re-offend. He regretted his actions and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The amount of gratification was relatively small. It was given not for the purposes of personal profit but to help the workers under his charge: if the site was caught with a violation for a third time, a stop work order would have been imposed and the 30 to 40 staff under the defendant’s charge would be jobless. He fully cooperated with the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) throughout the entire investigation.

16     The defence also submitted that if the custodial threshold was crossed, then the appropriate sentence would be 3 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, to run concurrently. In support of this position, counsel for the defendant cited the case of _PP v Ahmad Farhad bin Kadir Mastan_ (“**_Farhad_**”). Farhad was a contractor with the NEA. He was charged under s 6(a) PCA with attempting to obtain gratification from a vegetable seller, one Tan, so as to refrain from reporting a case of mosquito breeding against Tan. Farhad claimed trial; while his colleague, one Fahmy, pleaded guilty. Fahmy had approached Tan for a sum of $300 in return for Fahmy not reporting a finding of mosquito breeding to the NEA. Tan did not pay the sum and reported the incident to the police. Fahmy, who played the more active role in the negotiation of the bribe with Tan, was sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment; while Farhad was sentenced to one week’s imprisonment. Counsel submitted that, if the custodial threshold has been crossed, the present defendant should be sentenced to 3 weeks’ imprisonment as the facts, including the amount of gratification involved, were similar.

#### Sentencing considerations

17     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 6(b) PCA is a fine not exceeding $100,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, or both. The primary sentencing objective for offences of corruption is _deterrence_.

18     In my judgement, the custodial threshold had clearly been crossed in the present case. In bribing the employees of an NEA contractor, the defendant had subverted the integrity of the inspection process. This raised a very real public health risk – it increased the risk of undetected mosquito breeding and the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. The defendant did not commit the offences on the spur of the moment; the offences were pre-meditated and carried out over a four-month period (until the matter was investigated by the CPIB).

19     The receivers of the bribes, Tung and Chandran, had both been sentenced to 6 weeks’ imprisonment for the mirror charges. The defendant, as the initiator and giver of the corrupt gratification, was at least as culpable as the receivers of the bribes – if not more culpable. For reasons of parity, his sentence ought to be no less than the sentences received by Tung and Chandran.

20     With reference to the case of _Farhad_, which was cited by the defence (at \[16\], above), I found the culpability of the present defendant and the harm caused to be comparably higher. The defendant successfully corrupted Tung and Chandran into taking the bribes that he offered; unlike in _Farhad_ which involved an attempt to seek corrupt gratification. The present defendant faced five charges for the corrupt payments that he made regularly over a period of 4 months; while _Farhad_ involved only one charge. In _Farhad_, the co-offender Fahmy received a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment after he pleaded guilty; for the present defendant, a higher sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment would appropriately reflect the higher culpability and harm caused in the present case.

21     All in, the prosecution’s submission for a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge was, in my judgment, fair and reasonable.

#### Sentence imposed

22     Accordingly, the following sentences were imposed:

23     The defendant is presently serving the sentence. His _earliest date of release from prison is on 30 May 2019_.
