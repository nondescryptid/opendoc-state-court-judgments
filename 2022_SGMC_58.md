Civil Procedure – Offer to settle – Calderbank offer – Whether plaintiff reasonable in not accepting pre-writ Calderbank offers

Civil Procedure – Damages – Interest – Whether plaintiff should be disallowed interest

22 September 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan:

## Introduction

1       Calderbank offers, which owe their name to the case of _Calderbank v Calderbank_ \[1976\] Fam 93 (CA), allow parties to exchange offers to settle a matter “without prejudice save as to costs”; if the eventual outcome of the matter turns out to be less favourable than the Calderbank offer, the Calderbank offer may be shown to the court and can be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining costs: _Ong & Ong Pte Ltd v Fairview Developments Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 1285</span> (“_Ong & Ong_”) at \[35\] and _SBS Transit Ltd (formerly known as Singapore Bus Services Limited) v Koh Swee Ann_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 365</span> (“_SBS Transit_”) at \[21\] and \[24\].

2       Such a process of making an offer to settle, with a potential implication on costs, was formalised by O 22A of the Rules of Court 2014 (“ROC 2014”), which was introduced to “spur the parties to bring litigation to an expeditious end without judgment and thus save costs and judicial time” (_Singapore Airlines Ltd v Tan Shwu Leng_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 439</span> at \[37\]).

3       Nonetheless, Calderbank offers remain in place, even if their use has been significantly reduced in the light of the regime in O 22A. A survey of cases demonstrates the varying uses of Calderbank offers. For example, in _SBS Transit_, a pre-writ Calderbank offer was followed up with a formal offer to settle made pursuant to O 22A after the respondent commenced proceedings against the appellant. Later, in _NTUC Foodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 1043</span>, the respondents served a formal O 22A offer to settle before trial and followed this up with a Calderbank offer after the trial but before the appeal of the action.

4       Their continued relevance is caused in part by the fact that while a Calderbank offer can be issued before litigation starts, an O 22A offer to settle (“OTS”) can only be made after court proceedings have begun (_SBS Transit_ at \[16\]). Furthermore, the specificity and strict confines of the O 22A regime means that certain offers may fall “outside the ambit of the requirements in \[O 22A\] rr 9(1) and 9(3)” (_CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 2 SLR(R) 20</span> (“_CCM Industrial_”) at \[44\], per Chan Sek Keong CJ).

5       Whether Calderbank offers will retain their utility in light of the introduction of offers of amicable resolution (O 5 rr 1 and 2 of Rules of Court 2021 (“ROC 2021”)) which can be made before the commencement of an action is something that remains to be seen. What is for certain however is that a reasonable offer, whether titled an offer of amicable resolution or a “without prejudice save as to costs” offer, can continue to have implications on the costs order to be made, and in the appropriate case, can lead to an adverse costs order against a successful party (see O 21 rr 2 and 4 of ROC 2021).

6       Hence, regardless of the applicable ROC regime, the message, as the result of this application will show, remains uniform (_GTMS Construction Pte Ltd v Ser Kim Koi (Chan Sau Yan (formerly trading as Chan Sau Yan Associates) and another, third parties)_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 33</span> at \[23\]):

> … In so far as \[offers to settle\] represent genuine attempts by the parties to settle, the court should give such offers due recognition when it comes to the issue of costs. This is in line with the policy of encouraging parties to settle, thereby saving judicial time and costs.

## Facts

7       In this case, the accident occurred in February 2021, and parties began negotiations around August 2021, when the Plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the Defendants’ solicitors seeking damages of $20,997.81, with the breakdown as follows:[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

8       The Defendants responded by stating that they had a counterclaim against the Plaintiff for $1,915.00, this being their own cost of repairs, car rental and towing charges.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

9       Subsequently, on 3 September 2021, the Defendants made a global offer to settle the Plaintiff’s claim and their counterclaim by paying $9,991 to the Plaintiff and “costs and disbursements” which could “either be agreed between or respective law firms or be referred to the Registrar of the State Courts” (“the First Calderbank Offer”).[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) This offer was rejected ten days later, with the Plaintiff indicating that he was “maintaining his full claim”.[^4]

10     About one month later, on 12 October 2021, the Plaintiff gave ten clear days’ notice to the Defendants that he intended to issue a Writ of Summons in respect of his claim (“the 10 Days’ Notice”).[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) The Defendants replied the next day, stating that the Calderbank Offer remained “open for acceptance” (“the Second Calderbank Offer”).[^6]

11     The Plaintiff did not accept the Second Calderbank Offer, Instead, on 25 October 2021, he issued his Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim, in which he sought $20,018.81 in damages, as well as interest and costs.

12     The Defendants promptly answered with a formal O 22A OTS. The OTS was substantially similar to the two Calderbank Offer in that they offered to pay $9,991 in damages. However, rather than offering to pay costs and disbursements, the OTS set the issues of interest, costs and disbursements at large, to be determined by the Registrar of the State Courts.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

13     The OTS was not accepted. However, after parties attended three Court Dispute Resolution (“CDR”) sessions, the Plaintiff wrote to the Defendants on 25 February 2022 to accept the O 22A OTS that had been made about four months prior.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)

14     The settlement was recorded by the learned CDR judge on 21 April 2022, but despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue of interest, costs and disbursements, parties remain at odds as to whether any of such sums are due, the quantum of such sums, and who bears the liability for such sums.

15     By this application, the Defendants seek an order stipulating that they are not liable to pay the Plaintiff any interest in respect of the damages since any delay in receiving the sum of $9,991 was caused by his belated acceptance of their numerous offers.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) In addition, they are seeking costs and disbursements on an indemnity basis from the Plaintiff.

## Was the Calderbank offer superseded by the Offer to Settle?

16     As a preliminary issue, the Plaintiff submitted that the Second Calderbank Offer was superseded by the O 22A OTS. Presumably, this meant that the Second Calderbank Offer ought not to be taken into account in determining who should bear the costs and disbursements, as well as whether interest ought to be paid to the Plaintiff.

17     In support, the Plaintiff relied on the decision of Valerie Thean DJ (as she then was) (“Thean DJ”) in _Teng Lien Yen v SBS Transit Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGMC 10</span>, where her Honour stated (at \[9\], citing _Shi Fang v Koh Pee Huat_ \[1996\] 2 SLR 221 (“_Shi Fang_”)) that “\[w\]here successive offers are made, the first offer would be superseded by the second offer”.

18     In _Shi Fang_, the husband had made a “without prejudice” offer of $230,000 to his wife in settlement of all her claims, to which she did not respond. He then made a renewed offer of $150,000, this time on a Calderbank basis (_ie_, “without prejudice save as to costs”). Again, the wife did not respond to this latter offer, even though it was increased orally to $170,000. The wife subsequently obtained judgment against the husband for $250,000, which sum was upheld on appeal. In reversing the costs order made by the High Court judge, the Court of Appeal observed that the first “without prejudice” offer for $230,000 ought not to have been considered as it was not a Calderbank offer. Additionally, “it was superseded by the second offer \[of $150,000\], which was substantially below what was awarded” (at \[55\]).

19     Subsequently, in _SBS Transit_ (\[1\] _supra_), the Court of Appeal explained that while an O 22A OTS can only be withdrawn by following the procedure in O 22A r 3 of ROC 2014, no such procedure existed for Calderbank offers. To determine whether a Calderbank offer remains capable of acceptance, “the normal contractual principles of offer and acceptance would apply. That would mean that the respondent’s rejection of the offer … was an effective termination of that offer so that it could not be accepted thereafter unless renewed” (_SBS Transit_ (\[1\] _supra_) at \[20\]).

20     Here, the First Calderbank Offer was unequivocally rejected by the Plaintiff, who stated through his solicitors as follows: “Our client rejects your \[Calderbank offer\]. Our client is maintaining his full claim…”.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) However, after the Plaintiff gave the 10 Days’ Notice intimating his intention to commence proceedings, the Defendants’ counsel renewed the Calderbank Offer by informing the Plaintiff’s counsel that the offer remained “open for acceptance; if your client is minded to do so”. Alternatively, “if your client is minded to issue a Writ of Summons against our clients, … \[y\]ou can do so immediately and serve the Writ of Summons on us”.[^11]

21     Despite this Second Calderbank Offer, the Plaintiff elected to commence the action. It may be that this election represented a rejection of the Second Calderbank Offer, as in so doing the Plaintiff was effectively opting for one of two options presented by the Defendants. This appeared to be the assessment of all parties, as the Defendants proceeded to issue the O 22A OTS shortly after the writ was issued. Later, the Plaintiff accepted the O 22A OTS rather than the Second Calderbank Offer, suggesting that he did not think the Second Calderbank Offer remained open for acceptance. This was even though the Second Calderbank Offer, which provided that the Defendants would pay the Plaintiff costs and disbursements, was potentially more favourable than the OTS, which set the issue of costs and disbursements at large.

22     Therefore, it appears that parties were in agreement that the commencement of the action amounted to a rejection of the renewed Calderbank Offer. Viewed thus, the Second Calderbank Offer was not “superseded” by the O 22A OTS, which was made two days after the action was commenced, but by the Plaintiff’s own act of “rejecting” the Second Calderbank Offer when he elected to commence this action in lieu of accepting the offer.

## Whether costs should be payable by the Plaintiff to the Defendants

23     However, to focus on whether the Calderbank Offers had been “superseded” by the O 22A OTS misses the point. What is clear is that the two Calderbank Offers were never accepted by the Plaintiff, who elected to accept a potentially less favourable O 22A OTS after commencing the action. Regardless of whether the Second Calderbank Offer remained open for acceptance after the action was commenced, such conduct _may_ have an implication on costs (_SBS Transit_ (\[1\] _supra_) at \[24\]):

> … Our view is that if, despite the issue of such a \[Calderbank\] letter, the matter nevertheless goes to litigation and the result is less favourable to the litigant than the Calderbank offer, that fact should be one of the factors taken into account in the exercise of the judge’s discretion on costs. It need not, however, be a dominant factor. It will all depend on the circumstances of the particular case.

24     In this regard, “the court has broad discretion as to costs in assessing Calderbank offers. Generally, the court’s consideration will bear on the reasonableness or otherwise of an offeree’s refusal to accept the Calderbank offer. … This will … turn upon the terms of the Calderbank offer and the specific circumstances surrounding it” (_Ong & Ong_ (\[1\] _supra_) at \[37\]). Such an approach of considering all relevant circumstances, such as whether the Calderbank Offer had been rejected or ignored, is wholly consistent with the “court’s unfettered power to deal with costs (see O 59 r 2 \[of ROC 2014\])” (_CCM Industrial_ (\[4\] _supra_) at \[32\]). Similarly, even when an O 22A OTS has been made, O 22A r 9(5) of ROC 2014 provides that “the Court shall have _full power to determine by whom and to what extent any costs are to be paid_” \[emphasis added\].

25     In exercising this broad discretion, the court has regard to all the relevant circumstances, including the timing in which the Calderbank offer was made, as well as the terms of said offer. I elaborate on two cases which amply illustrate the differing outcomes that may result.

26     In _Lee Boon Poh Steven v Tan Teck Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] SGMC 10</span> (“_Lee Boon Poh_”), the defendant’s vehicle collided with the plaintiff’s car. Before the writ was issued, the defendant made a Calderbank offer to the plaintiff for $24,500. This offer was not accepted, and instead the plaintiff issued a writ. Subsequently, the parties agreed that damages (on a 100% basis) were $27,274.55. At trial, having regard to issues of contributory negligence, Thean DJ found that the defendant was 80% liable for the plaintiff’s loss, such that the plaintiff was awarded the sum of $21,819.64 plus interest. Having considered that the defendant admitted to being at fault at the scene of the accident, and as no allegations were made of contributory negligence before the writ, the learned judge found that the plaintiff was not unreasonable in rejecting the pre-writ Calderbank offer and commencing the claim. There was also no obstructiveness or tardiness on the plaintiff’s part once the claim was commenced. Nonetheless, in all the circumstances of the case, and having regard to the pre-writ Calderbank offer, the judge made no order as to costs.

27     In _Butcher v Wolfe and Wolfe_ \[1999\] 1 FLR 334 (“_Butcher v Wolfe_”), the defendant made a Calderbank offer to purchase the plaintiff’s interest in the land on a tenanted basis, and stated that if the sum was not acceptable but the basis of valuation was agreed, parties could have it determined by an independent valuation. The plaintiff rejected this because she disagreed with the basis of valuation. However, during the course of the action, she accepted the offer on the basis for which the defendant had always contended and which she had always opposed. In the circumstances, the plaintiff was made to pay all the costs of the action for her conduct.

28     On this footing, I proceed to consider the entire circumstances of this case, including the two pre-writ Calderbank Offers.

### Uncommunicated “reasons” for rejecting the Calderbank Offers

29     As a start, the Pre-Action Protocol for Non-Injury Motor Accident Cases in Appendix C of the State Courts Practice Directions (“NIMA Protocol”) sets out an extensive list of steps that parties must take before commencing a claim. This includes utilising reasonable efforts to settle by partaking in _at least_ eight weeks of negotiations before a claimant can give ten clear days’ notice of his intention to proceed with a writ (NIMA Protocol at para 8.3). These steps were designed precisely to aid parties in achieving an amicable settlement _pre-writ_, and even if a global settlement cannot be achieved, this may result in, for example, an early agreement on liability prior to the commencement of proceedings (see NIMA Protocol at para 11).

30     However, the Plaintiff appeared to comply with the protocol in _form_ only. To her credit, counsel for the Plaintiff, Ms Chelliah Lalita (“Ms Chelliah”), attempted to justify the Plaintiff’s refusal to accept the two Calderbank Offers by raising several issues with the offers.

31     First, it was submitted that while the Calderbank Offers stipulated that the Defendants would “pay costs and disbursements”, which could be agreed or be referred to the Registrar of the State Courts, such offers had been made pre-writ. Hence, if parties were unable to agree on costs and disbursements, proceedings would have to be initiated for such sums to be determined.

32     Secondly, no explanation had been provided by the Defendants as to how the sum of $9,991 had been arrived at. It was also unclear what the Defendants’ views on liability were, nor did the Plaintiff have any documents in support of the Defendants’ alleged counterclaim. Relatedly, the Defendants did not inform the Plaintiff whether a single joint expert would be called to give a report on the reasonable costs of repair for the Plaintiff’s vehicle. For these reasons, the Plaintiff could not accept the Calderbank Offers.

33     While these could have been legitimate reasons for not accepting the Calderbank Offers, the fundamental difficulty is that such reasons were raised belatedly, long after the action had commenced, and seemingly only after the Defendants sought an order for the Plaintiff to bear the costs of the action. At _no_ point during the pre-writ negotiations did the Plaintiff raise these objections or concerns which allegedly hindered his ability to accept the Defendants’ Calderbank Offers. Whatever the Plaintiff’s reasons might have been at the material time, no reason was communicated by him to the Defendants. Instead, the simple and incontrovertible fact is that he rejected or ignored the Calderbank Offers before initiating the present action. This might have been due to his confidence that he would receive his claimed sum of about $20,000,[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) but like the Defendants, the court is none the wiser about the Plaintiff’s thought process as it was never elaborated upon in the series of correspondence between parties.

34     I pause here to observe that there _may_ have been advantages with commencing the action, for example if parties had reached an impasse on the issue of liability during negotiations and required indications from a CDR judge to move the matter towards settlement. However, like the reasons provided by Ms Chelliah (at \[31\] and \[32\] above), no such reasons were not provided to the Defendants during the course of pre-action negotiations, pursuant to the scheme in the NIMA Protocol. Had the Plaintiff raised such issues, the Defendants may have provided their explanation, or a better breakdown and support of their offer, thus edging parties towards settlement and potentially obviating an action.

35     In any case, the issues raised (at \[31\] and \[32\] above) were plainly not intractable issues which necessarily required the initiation of proceedings to be resolved. For example, any difficulties with negotiating the costs payable under the Calderbank Offer would have been significantly mitigated by the costs guides at para 9.1 of the NIMA Protocol.

### Timing of the Second Calderbank Offer

36     Furthermore, the action was initiated shortly after the First Calderbank Offer was _expressly_ renewed. This gave the Plaintiff another opportunity to consider or probe deeper into the basis of the offer before initiating the action and incurring the attendant costs, but he chose again to ignore that offer.

37     To recapitulate, the Plaintiff had rejected the Defendants’ First Calderbank Offer in mid-September 2021. This was a blanket rejection, made without any substantive reasons, and as such, negotiations between the parties came to a grinding halt. Subsequently, in October 2021, about one month after the First Calderbank Offer was sent, the Plaintiff issued his 10 Days’ Notice as required under para 8.3 of the NIMA Protocol. This did not deter the Defendants’ desire to negotiate, and they instead renewed the Calderbank Offer replying that their earlier offer remained “open for acceptance”.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

38     This Second Calderbank Offer provided a revived opportunity for the Plaintiff to engage in discussions with the Defendants, for example to seek clarifications on how the Defendants had arrived at the quantum in their offer, or to understand the Defendants’ position on liability.

39     Unfortunately, it appears that little to no regard was had to the renewed offer. As was the case with the First Calderbank Offer, no reasons were provided for such disregard, nor were any concerns raised about how the Defendants had arrived at the (unchanged) $9,991 figure. Instead, the Plaintiff ignored the offer and elected to commence proceedings.

40     With the benefit of hindsight, this was plainly an unwise decision. By proceeding with the action only to accept the Defendants’ O 22A OTS some four months later, the Plaintiff has been left worse off. While he will still receive $9,991 in damages, the costs and disbursements are now set at large. Such costs and disbursements were sums that the Defendants had unequivocally offered to pay the Plaintiff through the pre-writ Calderbank Offers, and had the Plaintiff been concerned about the _quantum_ of costs and disbursements that the Defendants were offering, this could have been discussed, with reference made to the objective guide to costs provided at para 9.1 of the NIMA Protocol.

### The proceedings could have been avoided

41     The route adopted by the Plaintiff to obtain the same sum in damages could well have been avoided, and it resulted in wasted time and costs for the Defendants who have, amongst other filings, tendered their Memorandum of Appearance, Defence and Counterclaim and List of Documents. In total, there were also close to ten rounds of CDR sessions. This expended valuable judicial resources that could have been applied to other matters. Furthermore, since the parties could not agree on who should bear the costs and disbursements for the matter, the present application had to be taken out, thus prolonging the dispute. Borrowing the words of the court in _Butcher v Wolfe_ (\[27\] _supra_)), the Plaintiff “obtained nothing from the proceedings that \[he\] could not equally and altogether more cheaply have obtained by accepting the \[Calderbank Offers\]” (at 346, per Simon Brown LJ).

42     Essentially, the Plaintiff’s unmoving position and failure to provide reasons for his staunchness forced the Defendants to defend this action, which action could have been obviated had the Plaintiff seriously considered and probed deeper to understand the basis of the Defendants’ offers. The following passage saliently describes what the Plaintiff ought to have done, but failed to do (_CKR Contract Services Pte Ltd v Asplenium Land Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 81</span> at \[111\], per Ang Cheng Hock J):

> … \[L\]et me caution that parties should _carefully consider and evaluate offers to settle disputes_. They represent an avenue to minimise the costs of litigation, and can save considerable time and resources. It is for this reason that there may be consequences when they are _unjustifiably ignored_. \[emphasis added\]

### The Plaintiff should bear the costs and disbursements of the proceedings

43     Nonetheless, Ms Chelliah submitted that her client ought to be entitled to costs because the settlement had been recorded for her client to receive $9,991 in damages. However, to grant the Plaintiff costs under such circumstances would be to give no heed to the Calderbank Offers that were made and would cause them to lose their teeth (see _Lee Boon Poh_ (\[26\] _supra_) at \[12\]).

44     Summarising the above, the Plaintiff took the risk of proceeding without taking steps to better understand the Defendants’ pre-writ offers, which offers turned out to be substantially similar to the post-writ offer that the Plaintiff decided to accept. In such circumstances, I am of the view that it would be wholly unfair to make the Defendants bear the entirety of their costs in defending the action, which costs could well have been saved but for the Plaintiff’s unwillingness to negotiate seriously at the pre-writ stage. Hence, I order the Plaintiff to compensate the Defendants for the costs and disbursements of the action and this application.

45     As regards the quantum, having regard to the relatively early stage of the proceedings (before parties exchanged Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief), and to the sum settled, I fix costs and disbursements at $2,200 (all-in), to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendants. This sum is slightly lower than the $2,500 sought by the Defendants, in the main because I have made some discount for the costs that would have been payable by the Defendants to the Plaintiff (about $300 to $700, per the scale at para 9.1 of the NIMA Protocol) had he accepted the Calderbank Offers at the pre-writ stage. Due regard has also been given to the work done by the Defendants in respect of this summons.

## Whether the Plaintiff is entitled to interest

46     The O 22A OTS that was accepted by the Plaintiff also set the issue of interest at large, to be determined by the Registrar of the State Courts.

47     An award of interest does not serve as compensation to a plaintiff for the loss and damage suffered, but “as compensation to a plaintiff for being kept out of money which ought to have been paid to him timeously, but was not” (_Ng Chee Wee v Tan Chin Seng_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 54</span> at \[71\], citing _Lee Soon Beng v Wee Tiam Sing_ <span class="citation">\[1985–1986\] SLR(R) 799</span> at \[5\]). Special circumstances such as unreasonable and unjustified delay on the plaintiff’s part in prosecuting a claim have been held to be sufficient reasons for denying a plaintiff interest, or for cutting off interest at a certain date: see _Nirumalan V Kanapathi Pillay v Teo Eng Chuan_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Nirumalan_”) at \[44\]–\[54\] and _Tan Siew Bin Ronnie v Chin Wee Keong_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 178</span> at \[36\]–\[37\]. Put another way, if the plaintiff has by his own conduct or delay “kept himself out of his money, … there is no reason for the defendant to compensate him for that” (_Nirumalan_ at \[49\]).

48     The Plaintiff here could have received payment of the $9,991 as well as costs and disbursements to be agreed or fixed by the Registrar if he accepted the pre-writ Calderbank Offers. Instead, he took out this action without first engaging in serious discussions to understand the sums in the pre-writ offers, which turned out to be slightly more advantageous than the post-writ O 22A OTS that he accepted. Any delay in receiving payment of the damages of $9,991, of which an award of interest would apply, was thus largely self-inflicted by the Plaintiff’s own conduct. The Defendants ought not to be penalised for such, and accordingly, I hold that the Defendants shall not be liable to pay the Plaintiff any interest in respect of this action.

## Conclusion

49     My orders are summarised as follows:

> (a)     the Plaintiff shall pay to the Defendants costs and disbursements of the action and application fixed at $2,200 (all-in); and

> (b)     the Defendants shall not be liable to pay the Plaintiff any interest in respect of the present matter.

50     Before closing, I should mention that the Defendants’ practice of serving an O 22A OTS in the same sum as a pre-writ Calderbank offer is not a novel one. In 2005, Thean DJ observed that “some players in the motor industry routinely follow upon a closely-considered global pre-writ offer with an \[O 22A\] OTS in the same sum, and thereafter press for a variety of costs sanctions against plaintiffs” (_Lee Boon Poh_ (\[26\] _supra_) at \[16\]). By declining such an offer, a plaintiff “is potentially open to costs sanctions that may be wholly disproportionate to his original claim” (_Lee Boon Poh_ at \[18\]).

51     This case serves as a timely reminder of the costs consequences that may be visited upon a party that does not partake seriously in pre-writ negotiations, in particular when faced with an offer from the defendant that is not entirely unreasonable. At the same time, it is incumbent on defendants, if the intention is to avoid the need to defend an unnecessary action, to provide reasonable and timely offers, as well as to substantiate such offers with the necessary documentation and breakdown, if available. A clear channel of communication between parties could very well have obviated the present action, and will certainly be useful in minimising future repeats of such disputes.
