Criminal Law – Statutory Offences – Misuse of Drugs Act

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Mandatory Minimum Sentence

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9797/2020/01.\]

15 September 2020

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## Introduction

1       This appeal against sentence filed by Mr Suresh s/o Eyamalai (“Mr Suresh”) arises from the anomalous situation where the **_mandatory minimum sentence_** for the proceeded charge was imposed against the said accused person. Mr Suresh had filed his appeal from prison on 31 August 2020, with the Notice of Appeal indicating his “_being dissatisfied with his sentence_… (imposed on) _the 24th day of August 2020, hereby appeals against the said sentence in the abovementioned case_”. While the Notice of Appeal does not explicitly specify the aspect of his sentence Mr Suresh was dissatisfied with, I must assume that Mr Suresh had perceived his sentence to be unduly harsh.

2       Notwithstanding the anomalous circumstances of Mr Suresh’s appeal against what was already the mandatory minimum sentence, it would be proper to set out, as a complete record, the events leading to his plea, to demonstrate that all procedural steps have been taken, and that Mr Suresh, despite his position in filing this appeal, would have understood the nature and consequences of his plea. The record, as set out, will show that Mr Suresh, who was advised by competent counsel, would have duly comprehended his plea. Before sentence was imposed, there were successive iterations by learned counsel and the court of what the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence for the proceeded charge would entail.

### The approach set out for appeals against mandatory minimum sentences by accused persons in Mohammad Fauzi v Public Prosecutor

3       The approach described above would be congruent with the salient considerations set out by See Kee Onn JC (as he then was) in the case of _Mohd Fauzi bin Mohamed Mydin v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 313</span> (“Mohd Fauzi”), a case with a similar situation to the instant case, where the accused had appealed against sentence despite being given the mandatory minimum penalty. _Mohd Fauzi_ also dealt with the application of section 384 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), a provision which allows for the summary rejection of an appeal. The accused there had pleaded guilty in a District Court to a charge under section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) for consuming morphine, a specified drug. As a repeat offender, Mr Mohd Fauzi had been liable to be sentenced on a “Long Term- level 2” or “LT-2” charge which attracted enhanced punishment under s 33A (2) of the MDA.

4       In that case, when Mr Mohd Fauzi, who was represented, pleaded guilty on 2 June 2015, he was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. At counsel’s request, the court backdated the commencement of his imprisonment sentence to 1 April 2014, which was the date of his first remand. Notwithstanding this, Mr Mohd Fauzi appealed against his sentence.

5       See JC had, in dismissing Mr Mohd Fauzi’s appeal against sentence, indicated (at \[32\] of the judgment) that an examination of the grounds of decision and other components of the Record of Appeal would be proper for both the contemplation of the summary rejection process under s 384(1) of the CPC, as well as a general examination of the merits (or absence thereof) of an appeal brought by the accused against the imposition of a statutorily mandated minimum sentence, to ensure that:

> (a)    The grounds of appeal do not raise any question of law;

> (b)    It appears to the appellate court that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction; and

> (c)    There is no material in the circumstances of the case which could raise a reasonable doubt whether the conviction was right ...

6       The enumerated principles were subsequently reiterated, and further elucidated, in the case of _Faisal bin Tahar v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 501</span>; <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 125</span> (at \[10\]- \[13\]), which involved an LT-1 case, where the liability for enhanced punishment had been predicated, in part, on the accused’s residence at a drug rehabilitation centre.

### The Parties

7       As indicated above, Mr Suresh was represented at the time of his plea. His counsel was Mr A Revi Shanker s/o K Annamalai (“Mr Revi”) who practiced under the name and style of ARShanker Law Chambers. Mr Revi, who had been engaged by the accused’s family after the rejection of his application for a CLAS appointed lawyer[^2], had been on board to represent Mr Suresh since March 2020[^3]. DPP Emily Koh represented the State.

### The Charge

8       The following charge was read to Mr Suresh in Tamil by a certified interpreter:

> (_Mr Suresh is_) charged that (_he_) on or about 5 August 2019, between 3.45 am to 10.45 am, in Central Police Division Regional Lock-up, Singapore, did fail, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of (_his_) urine within such time as was required by Police Officers of Central Police Divisional Headquarters, namely Senior Staff Sergeant Mohamad Salihin Bin Ibnor, Senior Staff Sergeant Ng Boon Kiat, Staff Sergeant Syed Syed Muhammad Hafeez Bin Syed Zainal Abidin Alhabshee, Station Inspector Melvin Chung Kin Fatt, Senior Staff Sergeant Tan Thian Chin Lawrence and SGT Amirul Haikal Bin Khairudin for urine tests to be conducted under Section 31(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 008, Rev Ed), and you have thereby committed an offence under section 31(2) of the said Act.

> And further,

> that (_he_) before the commission of the said offence, (was) on 27 December 2012, in District Court, No. 6, in Singapore, vide DAC27548/2012, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, **cannabinol derivatives**, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and punished under Sec 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date. And (_he_) shall now be liable to be punished under Sec 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)

> …

> Punishment:

> **_Minimum: 7 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane_**

> Maximum: 13 years’ imprisonment with 2 strokes of the cane

> \[Emphasis added\]

9       It should be noted that the minimum sentence of seven years and six strokes of the cane is indicated at the foot of the charge, and would have been **_read out_** by the interpreter in the ordinary course of her duties. The interpreter had also indicated that Mr Suresh understood the nature and consequences of his plea.[^4]

### The Law

10     The relevant law in relation to the obtaining of urine samples from individuals suspected of drug consumption for the purpose of testing the said samples is set out in section 31 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008, Rev Ed)

> 31\. — (1)    Any officer of the Bureau, immigration officer or police officer not below the rank of sergeant may, if he reasonably suspects any person to have committed an offence under section 8(b), require that person to provide a specimen of his urine for urine tests to be conducted under this section.

> …

> (2)    A person who fails, without reasonable excuse, to provide a specimen of his urine within such time as may be required by any of the officers referred to in subsection (1)…shall be guilty of an offence.

11     Mr Suresh was unfortunately a repeat drug offender who had served a previous long-term level 1 (LT1) term of imprisonment of five years and six months and received three strokes of the cane. He was thus liable to suffer a regime of enhanced punishment under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Section 33(2) of the Act provides that:

> (2)    Where a person who has been convicted _(under the LT- regime_) is again convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug under section 8(b), **_an offence of failure to provide a urine specimen under section 31(2)_**, or an offence of failure to provide a hair specimen under section 31A(2), he shall on conviction be punished with —

>> (a)     **_imprisonment for a term of not less than 7 years_** and not more than 13 years; and

>> (b)     **_not less than 6 strokes_** and not more than 12 strokes of the cane.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Counsel’s communications prior to plea being taken

12     Having dealt with the law in relation to the proceeded charge above, I will now _segue_ to matters that defence counsel communicated to the court at the point of time just before Mr Suresh pleaded guilty, which would show that Mr Suresh had been duly briefed by Mr Revi on, _inter alia_, an offer by the prosecution to recommend no more than the mandatory minimum sentence if he were to plead guilty.

13     24 August 2020 had been set for the first day of trial. Mt Suresh’s position had been to claim trial before his own defence counsel urged him to reconsider his position. To this end, Mr Revi had prior to the commencement of proceedings in open court, asked for time to separately discuss with the learned DPP and then speak to Mr Suresh, who had been in remand.

14     After this stand down, Mr Revi indicated that he had been told that the prosecution would be seeking nothing more than the mandatory minimum sentence if Mr Suresh would take a certain course that morning, but might seek an uplift upon his conviction if he proceeded to claim trial. Counsel had also spoken to the accused to give him an insight of the prosecution’s case and the evidence which would be brought to bear by the DPP to establish her case. In Mr Revi’s own words[^5]:

> Mr Revi:    I spoke to my client in detail and also showed him all these evidences which is going to be presented by the Prosecution if the trial goes on. And **_I advised him also the sentencing position of my learned friend_**. **_And also, I told him that if the trial goes on and he is found guilty, then there’s no more, basically, the minimum sentence would be given to him_**. The main thing I show him about the evidence…

> \[Emphasis added\]

15     Taking counsel’s account of having spoken “_in detail_” with Mr Suresh to review the “_evidences_” in prosecution’s case, the accused would have been expected to be properly apprised and made fully aware of his options. Significantly, the accused had also been told that the prosecution’s position was to seek merely the mandatory minimum sentence.

16     The circumstances, as revealed by Mr Revi from his discussions with client that morning, would unequivocally demonstrate that Mr Suresh had been properly advised by counsel before making a considered decision to plead guilty, and had thus done so with a fully understanding of the courses open to him. References to the mandatory minimum sentence had been made, and it would be surprising if Mr Suresh, having already served an LT1 sentence in 2012, would have remained ignorant of the **_nature and extent_** of such a sentence.

17     Upon the interpreter’s indication that Mr Suresh was tendering a plea of guilt, I had pursuant to the provisions of section 277 (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), recorded counsel’s confirmation that the accused:

> (i)    understood the nature and consequences of his plea; and

> (ii)  intended to admit to the offence without qualification

18     Mr Suresh’s guilty plea was recorded after Mr Revi gave his confirmation[^6] on both enumerated aspects.

### Statement of Facts

19     The Statement of Facts (SOF) was read out[^7] by the learned DPP to elicit Mr Suresh’s response on the facts set out. The SOF[^8] states:

> ACCUSED

> 1    The accused is Suresh S/O Eyamalai, male, 45 years (_identification particulars_) Singapore Citizen (D.O.B: 26 June 1975).

> THE ARREST

> 2    On the 5 August 2019, at or about 2.00am, the accused was arrested by police officers at Block 106 Jalan Bukit Merah (unit) Tiong Bahru Orchid, Singapore (_postal code_) on suspicion of consumption of controlled drug under s 8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “MDA”). A search was conducted on the accused. The accused was then brought to Central Police Division for further investigations. The accused was then placed in Central Police Division Regional Lock-Up.

> FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE (DAC-922385-2019) – FAILING TO PROVIDE SPECIMEN OF URINE FOR URINE TEST (LT2)

> 3    On 5 August 2019, at or about 3.45a.m., at the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) office of the Central Police Divisional Headquarters, the accused was, directed by one Senior Staff Sergeant Mohamad Salihin Bin Ibnor to provide a specimen of urine. The accused was served with a warning that failure to provide his urine specimen without a reasonable excuse was an offence under section 31(2) of the MDA (the “Warning”). The accused acknowledged the Warning.

> 4    Between 3:45 a.m. to 10:45 a.m. of 5 August 2019, in Central Police Division Lock-up, police officers not below the rank of Sergeant attempted to procure the accused’s urine and served the accused water approximately every half an hour. From 3.45am, at every half an hour until 10.45a.m., the accused consumed water but failed to provide any urine specimen. The Warning was administered each time the accused failed to provide a urine specimen and the accused acknowledged the Warning.

> **5**     At or about 10.05a.m. on 5 August 2019, the accused informed SGT Amirul Haikal Bin Khairudin that he did not want to give his urine specimen until he had seen his doctor at the Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”). **_The Warning was administered but the accused refused to provide his urine specimen._**

> **6**     The accused continued to be served water approximately every half an hour at about 10.15a.m., 10.45a.m and 11.15a.m. The accused consumed the water each time but failed to provide any urine specimen without reasonable excuse. The Warning was administered each time the accused failed to provide a urine specimen. **_The accused acknowledged the Warning but maintained that he did not want to give his urine specimen for the IUT_**.

> **7**     The accused arrived at the IMH at 3.28p.m. and at about 3.32p.m., he was asked by a CNB officer, Staff Sergeant Ong Choon Heng, to provide his urine specimen for an IUT. The Warning was administered but the accused refused to provide his urine specimen and informed the CNB officers that he wanted to see and talk to the IMH doctor.

> **8**     Subsequently, at about 2.55p.m. on 5 August 2019, the accused was escorted by CNB officers, Staff Sergeant Ong Choon Heng, Senior Staff Sergeant Gan Kok Wee and Senior Staff Sergeant Zaihazi Rapan, to IMH.

> **9**      **_At about 4.01p.m., the accused informed the CNB officers that he wanted to pass urine. The accused was directed to provide his urine specimen into the bottles for IUT testing. The Warning was administered but the accused refused to provide his urine specimen for IUT testing and instead insisted on passing urine into the urinal._**

> **10**     At about 4.30p.m., the accused was examined by Dr. Jayaraman Hariram at IMH and was **_found to be fit to provide his urine specimen._**

> **11**     After the accused ended his consultation with Dr. Jayaraman Hariram at about 4.46p.m., the accused was directed by Staff Sergeant Ong Choon Heng to provide his urine specimen for an IUT. **_The Warning was administered but the accused refused to provide his urine specimen. There was no reason for refusing to provide his urine specimen._**

> **12**     By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did fail to provide his urine sample for a urine test as required by police officers at Central Police Divisional Headquarters. The accused had been warned that it was an offence not to provide his urine sample and had been given water to drink every half an hour. The accused nevertheless failed to provide his urine sample within such time as he was required to do by the police officers at Central Police Divisional Headquarters without reasonable excuse, and he has thereby committed an offence under Section 31(2) of the MDA.

> **13 **     Further, prior to the commission of the offence, the accused was, on 27 December 2012, in the District Court, No. 6, in Singapore, vide DAC27548/2012, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, **cannabinol derivatives**, under Section 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and punished under Sec 33A(1) of the said Act with 5 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date. The accused shall now be liable to be punished under Sec 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed)

### Admission of facts stated

20     Mr Suresh admitted to the facts stated without any qualification[^9].

21     I noted that the facts stated in the SOF cohered with the contents of the charge, and showed the efforts by various police officers to procure a urine specimen from the accused for the purpose of testing within a seven-hour period between 3.45 am to 10.45 am on 5 August 2019. Mr Suresh had been supplied with water and given warnings in half-hour intervals. He had rebuffed their efforts, and explicitly told the officers that he did not want to give his urine specimen. Significantly, Mr Suresh also admitted to his wilful misconduct in the _sequelae_ after the seven-hour window, when he had “_insisted_” on passing urine at 4.01 pm in a urinal[^10] while waiting to be examined by a doctor from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).

22     This was, in the manner expressed in the SOF, a plainly deliberate act where Mr Suresh had spurned calls by escorting officers to provide a sample (which could only be collected within the parameters of a strict procurement protocol) for testing. Equally significantly, the accused was found to be medically and physiologically capable of passing urine by an IMH doctor; Dr. Jayaraman Hariram, in an examination which took place at 4.30 p.m., some 30 minutes after he had **_actually_** passed urine, in defiance of his escorting officers’ directions, into a toilet urinal at 4.01p.m at IMH premises.

23     Remarkably, when Mr Suresh was asked yet again at 4.46 p.m. to provide a urine sample, he again signalled his refusal to cooperate. Thus, even though the charge had been based on Mr Suresh’s failure to provide a sample within the seven-hour period of 3.45 am to 10.45 am, the SOF showed that Mr Suresh had remained defiant for a full **_13 hours_** from **3.45 am** to **4.46 pm** on 5 August 2019, where he had adamantly declined to provide a urine sample.

### Conviction

24     Given that Mr Suresh’s unqualified admissions to these facts supporting the charge in the SOF were patently sufficient to found a conviction on the single proceeded charge, I found Mr Suresh s/o Eyamalai to be guilty as charged and convicted him on the offence.

### Antecedents

25     Mr Suresh admitted[^11] to his fairly long criminal history comprising a varied list of crimes, taking up no fewer than 25 entries in his CRO 60 record. The accused’s drug antecedents began in 1994 with his consumption of a controlled drug for which he received an 18-month detention sentence from an SAF court martial panel. For completeness his criminal record is set out below (drug related offences have been highlighted):

### Recommendation on sentence

26     DPP Elaine Koh indicated[^12] that the prosecution had no objections to the imposition of the **_mandatory minimum sentence_** of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, which was, of course, the sentencing position communicated to Mr Revi earlier, and which he had in turn relayed to Mr Suresh, prior to his taking a certain course.

### Mitigation and response to DPP’s sentencing submissions

27     Mr Revi signalled that that he had nothing to say by way of mitigation as the prosecution was “_not asking more than 7 years minimum_”[^13] adding:

> Mr Revi:I think…based on the antecedent and also his past record…what they are asking is very, very reasonable based on the prescribed punishment, Your Honour. **_Which I told my client also just cannot go below than 7 years._** It is---it’s a law

### Sentencing remarks

28     Before imposing sentence, I made the following remarks[^14], where reference was made to the mandatory minimum sentence (in the highlighted passage):

> Court:    In this case, Mr. Suresh, just to let you know that I think it is very fortunate the DPP has taken a very moderate and benign position for sentencing, despite the fact this is actually day of the trial. And effectively it means that all their witnesses that needed to be prepared are actually here. I understand the circumstances of your case and I certainly do sympathise with your situation that you have been under the thrall of drug addiction for a very long time; since 1997. I think it is important to recognise that this is ruining your life. **_And that given the circumstances, the DPP having asked for the mandatory minimum sentence, it is fair to impose such a sentence._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Sentence

29     For the single proceeded charge, DAC No 922385-2019, I sentenced Mr Suresh to the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years; imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

### Accused’s basis for appealing his sentence remains uncertain

30     As indicated above, the Notice of Appeal merely referenced Mr Suresh being “_being dissatisfied with his sentence_” and that he “_hereby appeals against the said sentence in the abovementioned case_” without any explicit reference of the sentence being found by him to be manifestly excessive. I would, in any case, be unable to meaningfully discuss the severity of his sentence, given that I had imposed the **_lowest_** sentence I could, and allowed a backdating to Mr Suresh’s first remand.

### Improbability of accused being unaware of the nature of his sentence and actual extent of the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment

31     Notwithstanding this, Mr Suresh has registered his dissatisfaction with his sentence. The anomalous nature of his appeal has given me pause to wonder if Mr Suresh had somehow failed to apprehend that his sentence was the lowest that could be imposed, or had hitherto been unaware of the actual duration of such a sentence. On further reflection and analysis, this seems improbable for the following reasons:

> (a)     The charge **_explicitly_** states the minimum mandatory sentence at the foot of the document.

> (b)     Defence counsel had informed the court that prior to the accused’s plea of guilt, he had spoken[^15] to Mr Suresh and reviewed the evidence, Mr Revi had categorically stated that he had also advised the accused of the prosecution’s sentencing position of asking only for the **_minimum sentence_** to be imposed if he were to take a certain course that day.

> (c)     The interpreter had confirmed that the charge had been read to him and that Mr Suresh had **_understood_** the nature and consequences of his plea.

> (d)     The DPP had addressed the court and explicitly stated their sentencing position.

> (e)     Mr Revi had eschewed any substantive mitigation and described the proposed sentence to be “_very very reasonable_” given Mr Suresh’s antecedents. More significantly Mr Revi also confirms “**_I told my client also just cannot go below than 7 years_**” as this was the law.

> (f)     In my sentencing remarks where I had directly addressed the accused, I referred to his receiving the mandatory minimum sentence.

> (g)     Mr Suresh did not protest when the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years and six strokes was pronounced, and instead thanked[^16] the court.

### Accused made aware of liability for “LT-2 offence” ten months before guilty plea

32     Further to the above, records pertaining to the accused, it was evident that Mr Suresh had considerable advance notice of his sentencing range of the charge he faced, well before the day of his guilty plea on 24 August 2020. I had, in the preparation of these grounds and in an effort to discern Mr Suresh’s area of dissatisfaction with his sentence, perused the PTC minutes and noted that Mr Suresh had in a bail review on 1 October 2019 been told that the prosecution had objected to any reduction to the bail set at $50 000. The prosecuting officer had explained that this was “_standard bail_” for an “_LT-2 offence_”. Mr Suresh, who had already served an LT-1 sentence in 2012, could not be under any illusion that the duration for this _“LT-2 offence”_ would be anything but **_higher_** than the five years and six months he had served for the LT-1 charge. Thus even if the accused had not seen the minimum sentence indicated at the foot of the charge, Mr Suresh would have been alerted to the prospect of such a sentence since October 2019, some **_ten months_** before his plea of guilt on his first day of trial on 24 August 2020.

### The prosecution showed restraint in not asking for an uplift over the mandatory minimum sentence

33     In my sentencing remarks, I noted that the prosecution had taken a very “_moderate and benign position_” in their sentencing position, in the sense that the DPP had not sought an uplift over the mandatory minimum sentence. This was despite the fact that Mr Suresh had decided to plead guilty rather **_late_** in the day, at the metaphorical doorstep of trial itself. This would have been a trial where the prosecution had a witness list of no fewer than 11 factual and expert witnesses. It would have been of course incumbent on the DPP to notify and prepare her witnesses and have them ready for the trial, along with the usual getting-up work attendant to trial. Mr Suresh, on his part, had an equally expansive list of nine witnesses.

34     For completeness, Mr Suresh’s intended defence, had the case proceeded to trial, and as disclosed in his Case for the Defence (CFD) was that:

> (1)    As I was already intoxicated with alcohol, IMH Medications and I was high smoking a drug called Mushroom (clinically named 2-1-(5 Flouropentyl)-1H-Indozoie-3-Carbooxamid) 3, 3-Dimethylbutnoic acid isomer.

> (2)     **_I did not know or was aware of what was happening to me while I was in police custody._**

> (3)     **_I know that I was losing my mind and mentally incapacitated and only wanted to go to IMH for treatment._**

> \[Reproduced verbatim and uncorrected from the CFD other than removal of the full capitalization of all text found in the original\]

> \[Emphasis added\]

35     Mr Suresh had stated, in his CFD filed on 2 January 2020, his intent to, within his planned slate of nine witnesses, call four family members, including his sister. The sister; Ms Magesh d/o Eyamalai, had reportedly alerted police on 5 August 2019 that Mr Suresh had smoked _“Mushroom_”, which had caused him to be apprehended and taken to a police station for his urine sample to be procured.

36     Effectively Mr Suresh, according to his own hand-drafted CFD, was readily admitting to having consumed a novel synthetic controlled drug at the time he was arrested. From that document, the accused had apparently planned to put forward his drug and alcohol usage as a basis to explain his non-cooperation in the attempts made to procure his urine on the grounds that he did “_not know or was aware of what was happening_” to him while in police custody, and had been “_losing_ (his) _mind and mentally incapacitated_” at the time.

37     I would only observe that Mr Suresh would have had an uphill task of convincingly making his case of having experienced an episode of alcohol and drug induced “_mental incapacitation_” or other cognitive debilitation so profound as to have caused him to be completely unaware of what was happening to him while in police custody, and to the point of causing him to persistently refuse to co-operate with the obtaining of his urine sample for a **_full 13 hours_** (3.45 am to 4.46pm) on 5 August 2019. Notably Mr Suresh was sufficiently conscious of his situation, and coherent in his ability to make himself understood, as to be able to ask, and been allowed, to see a doctor at IMH, where he had been receiving treatment.

38     It was therefore fortunate for Mr Suresh that he allowed himself to be persuaded by his counsel; Mr Revi, to reconsider his position to claim trial. It was equally fortunate for him that the prosecution did not see fit to seek an uplift despite his late decision to take a certain course, and notwithstanding his varied criminal history with antecedents which included an LT-1 conviction in 2012, where he had received a sentence of five years and six months, which was six months **_higher_** than the mandatory minimum, in that instance.

### Conclusion

39     In my judgment, maintaining the mandatory minimum sentence, despite the premises stated above, leant somewhat heavily on the side of leniency. Nevertheless, given that the mandatory minimum would already entail an imprisonment term of seven years (with caning), which would be a severe sentence by any measure, I was of the view that such a sentence would not be so **_excessively_** lenient as to fail to serve the ends of justice, and so imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of seven years and six strokes of the cane against Mr Suresh s/o Eyamalai.
