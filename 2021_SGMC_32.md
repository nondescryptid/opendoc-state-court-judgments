Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Statutory Offences – Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, Cap 91A

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9099/2021/01.\]

21 May 2021

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

## Background

1       The Accused, Mr Goh Hock Meng, a 56 year-old Singapore citizen claimed trial to six charges under s 22(1)(_d_) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) of the Employment of Manpower Act (Cap 91A, Rev Ed 2009)(“EFMA”) and three charges under s 22(1)(_d_) read with s 23(1) and punishable under s 22(1)(ii) EFMA in _MAC 906923 of 2018_ to _MAC 906931 of 2018_. The breakdown of the nine charges are as follows:

> (a)     Five charges of furnishing false statements to the Controller of Work Passes in connection with work pass applications in respect of the fixed monthly salaries of his foreign employees in the Declaration Forms submitted to the Work Pass Division, Ministry of Manpower;

> (b)     one charge of furnishing false information in the form of fake salary vouchers to an Employment Inspector Tan Shi Ling, Serene to insinuate that a foreign employee was paid a monthly salary of $2,800 which he knew was false;

> (c)     two charges of abetting by instigating his foreign employees to furnish false statements to an Employment Inspector Tan Shi Ling, Serene by providing the said foreign employees with fake salary vouchers and instructing them to state that they were paid their full monthly salaries which he knew to be false;

> (d)     one charge of abetting by instigating his foreign employee to furnish false information to the Controller of Work Passes in connection with a work pass application by instructing him to falsely declare in the Declaration Form that his fixed monthly salary would be $2,570, which he knew was false.

2       The amended tenth charge under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA in MAC 906932 of 2018 of furnishing false information in the form of fake salary vouchers to an Employment Inspector Tan Shi Ling, Serene to insinuate that a foreign employee was paid a monthly salary of $2,570 which he knew was false was stood down. The Defence had objected to this charge as material amendments were made to the particulars of the charge prior to the commencement of the trial.

3       On the fourth day of the trial and after nine witnesses for the Prosecution had given evidence, Defence Counsel Mr Ragbir Singh s/o Ram Singh Bajwa indicated that the Accused wished to take a certain course of action. On 3 November 2020, pursuant to an offer by the Prosecution, the Accused pleaded guilty to two charges namely _MAC 906923 of 2018_ and _MAC 906927 of 2018_ under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA and one charge, _MAC 906931 of 2018_ under s 22(1)(_d_) read with s 23(1) EFMA. Seven of the remaining charges were to be taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing.

4       The matter was subsequently adjourned to enable the Prosecution to address the Court on sentence and for the Defence to prepare the written plea in mitigation. As the relevant foreign employees were no longer in Singapore, the case was adjourned on several occasions to enable the Accused to make restitution via overseas remittances to them.

5       On 27 April 2021, as the Accused had admitted to the Statement of Facts (_Exhibit PS1_) without any qualification, a global restitution of $55,758.98 was made to two of the foreign employees and in view of his overall criminality, I had sentenced him as follows:

6       The Accused being dissatisfied with my decision filed his Notice of Appeal against my sentences on 27 April 2021. He is presently on bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

7       Having set out the background for the present case, I now provide the reasons for my decision.

## Salient Facts

8       The Accused is Goh Hock Meng. During the material period on or about 25 November 2013 to 5 October 2016, he was the sole proprietor of one Golden Café Food Place with the registered address at 5 Craig Road Singapore 089665 (the “business”).

9       On 31 August 2016, Tan Shi Ling, Serene, an Employment Inspector of the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”), carried out investigations upon receiving information on possible contravention of the laws relating to the employment of foreign employees under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (Chapter 91A).

#### FACTS RELATING TO MAC 906923 of 2018

10     Investigations revealed that, on or about 25 August 2015, the Accused in connection with the application for work pass (S-Pass) for a foreign employee, Nguyen Thi Hue (“Nguyen”) to be employed by the business, did make statements to the Controller of Work Passes (the “Controller”) which was false in a material particular, in the “Declaration Form” (the “Form”) submitted to the Work Pass Division of the Ministry of Manpower.

11     The Accused declared by signing on the Form that the business would be paying Nguyen the declared monthly salary of $2,800 when Nguyen only received $1,230. The Accused knowingly signed on the Form which boosted Nguyen’s chances to be employed as an S-Pass holder.

12     One material criterion for the granting of an S-Pass is that the applicant must meet the minimum salary requirement. Based on the declaration in the Form, the application for S-Pass for Nguyen was approved and the S-Pass was subsequently issued to her over the period of validity of the work pass from 18 August 2015 to 18 August 2016.

13     A foreign employee’s salary as stated in the Form is a material consideration used by the Work Pass Division (“WPD”) in granting the work pass. WPD had confirmed that but for the accused’s false declaration in the Form, Nguyen would not have been granted the S-Pass.

#### FACTS RELATING TO MAC 906931 of 2018

14     Investigations revealed that, the Accused abetted one Liu Chuan who was an employee of the business, by instigating him to make a false statement to an Employment Inspector, Tan Shi Ling, Serene, which he knew was false in a material particular at the Employment Inspectorate, Ministry of Manpower, located at 1500 Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946.

15     Fake salary vouchers for the period of 20 July 2016 to 5 September 2016 were prepared and given to Liu Chuan for the purposes of submitting them to the MOM during investigations.

16     During the recording of Liu Chuan’s statement, Liu Chuan informed accordingly that he had been receiving his full monthly salary of $2,800 and furnished the fake salary vouchers to Employment Inspector Serene. In so doing, Liu Chuan had misled the course of investigations.

17     Eventually, Liu Chuan admitted that he has only been receiving a monthly salary of $1,330. Liu Chuan admitted that he was given fake salary vouchers indicating that he was paid $2,800 by the Accused and had also been instructed by the Accused to give a false statement to MOM.

#### FACTS RELATING TO MAC 906927 of 2018

18     Investigations revealed that on 23 September 2016, in connection with Nguyen, an employee employed by the business, the Accused furnished false information to an Employment Inspector, Tan Shi Ling, Serene, which he knew was false in a material particular at the Employment Inspectorate, Ministry of Manpower, located at 1500, Bendemeer Road, Singapore 339946.

19     The Accused was investigated for offences relating to false declaration of salaries of foreign employees employed by the business. In the course of a statement taking process, the Accused produced fake salary vouchers of Nguyen to insinuate that Nguyen was paid her full monthly salary when this was not true. Eventually the investigations had shown that the salary vouchers were not genuine and investigations were misled.

#### CONCLUSION

20     Based on the facts above, the Accused had made a false declaration to the work pass system in order to circumvent the work pass framework to employ Nguyen as a S-Pass holder. The Accused had also instigated Liu Chuan to make a false statement to an Employment Inspector and had himself made a false statement to the Employment Inspector.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

21     S 22(1)(ii) EFMA provides that the prescribed penalty for an offence under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA is a fine not exceeding $20,000, or to a term of imprisonment of not exceeding two years, or with both.

### Antecedents

22     The Accused had no related antecedents.

#### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

23     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of ten weeks’ imprisonment for the present case by having the sentences for _MAC 906923 of 2018_ and _MAC 906931 of 2018_ ordered to run consecutively.

24     For the amended first charge in _MAC 906923 of 2018_, the Prosecution sought a sentence of at least eight weeks’ imprisonment. In support of their submissions, they relied on the sentencing framework set out by the High Court in _Chiew Kok Chai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 713</span> (“_Chiew Kok Chai”_) for cases of false declarations in work pass applications under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA.

25     For the remaining two charges in _MAC 906927 of 2018_ and _MAC 906931 of 2018_, the Prosecution sought a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each charge. It was submitted that the principle of deterrence must take centre stage in cases which involved the provision of false information to public servants and reference was made to the seminal case of _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25\].

#### Defence’s Submissions on Sentence

26     In contrast, the Defence sought a global custodial sentence of one day’s imprisonment with an appropriate fine to meet the ends of justice. While the Defence was aware that the High Court in _Chiew Kok Chai_ had indicated that a custodial sentence should be the norm, it was submitted that a heavy fine would also be able to meet the requirements of general and specific deterrence. It was highlighted that the fine is substantially high as the maximum fine is $20,000.

## My decision on sentence

27     I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case involved serious offences which attracted the principle of deterrence. I further agreed that there were offender-specific aggravating factors present in this case.

### Sentencing principles

### MAC 906923 of 2018

28     In my consideration of the appropriate sentence for _MAC 906923 of 2018_, I was bound by the sentencing framework for offences under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA as set out by the High Court in _Chiew Kok Chai._ This two-step sentencing bands approach sets a custodial sentence as the benchmark sentence for cases of false declarations in work pass applications under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA.

#### First Step of the sentencing bands approach

29     The first step was for me to identify the indicative starting point. To do so, I had to identify the offence-specific factors that were present in this case. I was guided by the non-exhaustive list of _offence-specific factors_ set out in _Chiew Kok Chai_ at \[67\] in determining the indicative starting point namely:

> (a)     The materiality of the false representation on the mind of the decision-maker;

> (b)     The nature, sophistication and extent of deception;

> (c)     The consequences of the deception;

> (d)     Whether a transitional element was present and/or whether the offence was committed as part of a criminal syndicate’s operations;

> (e)     The specific role played by the offender and the number of people involved in the furnishing of false information;

> (f)     Whether the offender obtained gains (financial or otherwise) from the commission of the offence; and

> (g)     The motive of the offender in circumventing the work pass framework (e.g. for vice or criminal activities).

### Offence-specific factors

#### Materiality of false representation

30     It was the Prosecution’s case that the application for a work pass made by the Accused was approved on the basis that the foreign employee would be paid the monthly salary declared by the Accused to the Controller of Work Passes. This was unchallenged by the Accused when he accepted \[5\] and \[6\] of the Statement of Facts unconditionally. Hence, I agreed with the Prosecution that the falsehood was material as the work pass would not have been approved by Work Pass Division, Ministry of Manpower had the Accused declared the foreign employee’s actual monthly salary.

#### The deception and its consequence

31     I further agreed with the Prosecution that the deception was conscious, deliberately planned and difficult to detect. As the sole-proprietor of Golden Café Food Place, he was in charge of all operational and business matters of the business and was the only person authorized to sign on work pass application forms for all foreign employees employed by the business. I noted that the Accused’s deception went undetected for more than two years’ and nine months’ until a complaint was lodged to MOM on possible contravention of the laws relating to the employment of foreign employees under EFMA. I considered that his offending behaviour was clearly not one-off but a course of conduct that had persisted over a substantial period of time.

32     I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that the Accused knew that he had to inflate the amount of salary in order to boost the chances of Nguyen being granted an S-Pass. In his plea in mitigation, the Accused himself conceded that he needed to put the minimum figure in terms of the salary amount as otherwise the work pass application would be rejected. I agreed with the Prosecution this motivated the Accused to make the false declaration.

33     I noted that the Accused’s deception was not confined to making false declarations in his work pass applications to Work Pass Division of MOM. When MOM began investigations, in order to maintain this deception of the inflated monthly salaries, the Accused and his foreign employees produced fake salary vouchers to give the impression they have been paid in full.

34     I agreed with the Prosecution that this was to discredit the complaint of underpayment. Thus, I did not accept the Defence’s position that the Accused had been co-operative during the MOM investigations. Further, I was mindful that of the ten charges that were preferred, five charges related to the Accused’s efforts to evade detection of the five false declaration offences.

#### Motive of offender in circumventing work pass framework

35     It was the Prosecution’s case that the Accused’s motive in making the false declaration to MOM was to increase Nguyen’s chance of getting the S-Pass and to pay Nguyen a lower salary than what was declared. The Defence had conceded in the plea in mitigation that it was accepted that but for the false declaration, the Work Pass Division would not have granted the S Pass.

36     Nevertheless, the Defence sought to downplay the underpayment of salaries by submitting that the Accused had provided the foreign employees with comfortable accommodation which was within walking distance from his café. This would have saved the foreign employees on transportation costs. It was further suggested by the Defence that the cost of accommodations and meals plus the salary of the worker ($1,230) would have amounted to $2,800 and the Work Pass Division would have been persuaded to grant the Work Pass.

37     In response, the Prosecution had disagreed with the assertion that accommodations were provided for free as it was contrary to their investigations. It was submitted that in fact, additional deductions were made to salaries of the foreign employees for the purposes of accommodation. Accordingly, I found no merit in the Defence’s contention that the Work Pass Division would have been persuaded to grant the Work Pass had the cost of the accommodation and meals been factored in.

38     Based on the above, I accepted that the work pass framework has been circumvented by the Accused. As highlighted by the Prosecution, the work pass framework is an important instrument of the MOM to maintain the balance of the Singapore workforce and any case of abuse is one too many. I agreed that the Court needs to send a strong signal to unscrupulous individuals that the framework is not one that can be easily exploited.

39     I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Accused had deprived others of legitimate working opportunities in Singapore. As the number of work passes to be issued to foreigners are regulated by quotas, the grant of work passes for these workers effectively deprived other honest employers of their chances to foreign manpower.

#### Financial gains

40     I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions that the Accused gained significant amount of profits from the savings resulting from the underpayment of salaries. At the material time, the foreign employees worked for the Accused at lower salaries and the shortfall is reflected in the table below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32%"> <col width="26%"> <col width="22%"> <col width="20%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>MAC No</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Worker</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Shortfall</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Status</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>MAC 906923 of 2018</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Nguyen Thi Hue</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$18,843.98</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unpaid</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>MAC 906929 of 2018</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Liu Chuan</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$3,300.09</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unpaid</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>MAC 906924 of 2018</em> &amp;</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>MAC-906928 of 2018</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Le Van Dai</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$15,075.16</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unpaid</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><em>MAC-906926 of 2018</em></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Xu Kaifei</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$36,915</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Unpaid</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Total Shortfall</p></td><td align="left" class="" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$74,134.23</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

41     I next considered the sentencing bands proposed by the Prosecution in _Chiew Kok Chai_ and endorsed by the High Court reproduced below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="13.1%"> <col width="56.06%"> <col width="30.84%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Elaboration</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lower end of the spectrum, involving one or very few offence-specific factors, or where offence-specific factors were not present to a significant degree.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Short custodial sentence of less than five months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Middle band of the spectrum, involving higher levels of seriousness or harm, comprising cases falling between Bands 1 and 3.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Five to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Higher end of the spectrum, involving numerous offence-specific factors, or where the offence-specific factors were present to a significant degree.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 24 months'</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">numerous offence-specific factors, or imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

42     In my view, based on the offence-specific factors above, the present charge fell within the lower end of Band 1 of the sentencing range which attracted a short custodial sentence of less than five months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that the appropriate starting point sentence was seven weeks’ imprisonment.

43     Having identified the relevant sentencing band and the indicative starting point sentence in accordance with the first step of the two-step framework in _Chiew Kok Chai_, I turned next to consider the second step of the framework. This involved consideration of the offender-specific factors, _ie_, the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender.

#### Second Step of the sentencing bands approach

### Offender-specific factors

44     In calibrating the sentence based on the offender-specific factors, I considered it as a mitigating factor that a substantial restitution of $55,758.98 was subsequently made by the Accused to two of the foreign employees, Nguyen Thi Hue and Xu Kaifei. Although the Accused was prepared to make a further payment of $3,300.09 to Li Chuan, the Prosecution were unable to secure the details of his bank account to facilitate the overseas remittance. Hence, I was prepared to accept and gave weight to the various efforts the Accused made to make these overseas remittance as an expression of his contrition and remorse.

45     The Prosecution had highlighted that seven charges had been taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. I agreed with the Prosecution that the presence of such charges has been recognised as generally resulting in an enhanced sentence, especially if that charge is similar in nature to the proceeded charge: _Public Prosecutor v Chow Yee Sze_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 481</span> at \[34\].

46     I further considered the Accused’s plea of guilt came only after three days of trial and after nine Prosecution witnesses had given evidence. Accordingly, I gave little weight to the Accused’s plea of guilt.

#### Sentencing Precedent

47     In support of their sentencing position, the Prosecution had relied on an unreported case namely _PP v Lim Beng Chon_ MAC 909870 of 2019 and others (23 June 2020). In that case, the offender committed offences under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA when he inflated the salary of his foreign employee in the application form when his intention was to pay him a lower amount. The period of deception for that case was one year and four months. The salary of his foreign employee was inflated in the application form in order to boost her chance of getting the S-Pass. For making the false declaration, he was sentenced to seven weeks’ imprisonment term after he pleaded guilty to the charge at first instance.

48     Although the factual matrix were similar, I was mindful the case had little precedential value as there were no written grounds which explained the reasons for the sentence. Furthermore, in that case no restitution was made to the foreign employee.

49     Nevertheless, I agreed with the Prosecution that making a false statement to the Controller of Work Passes in order to obtain a work pass is a serious offence as it involves a deception to a public institution. For the reasons above, in my view a sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment was appropriate and was of sufficient deterrence for the charge in _MAC 906923 of 2018_.

50     In my view, the proposed sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution was on the high side as it had not factored in the substantial restitution that was made by the Accused. A sentence of one day’s imprisonment and the appropriate fine proposed by the Defence was clearly inadequate and inconsistent with the sentencing bands in _Chiew Kok Chai_ in light of the seriousness of the offence as well as the offence-specific and offender-specific factors in this case.

51     I now turn to the two remaining charges.

#### **_MAC 906927 of 2018_** and **_MAC 906931 of 2018_**

52     The Prosecution had sought a custodial sentences of two weeks for each charge in _MAC 906927 of 2018_ and _MAC 906931 of 2018_. I agreed with the Prosecution that such a custodial sentence was justified considering the seriousness of the offence. I accepted that it is trite that the principle of deterrence must take centre stage in cases which involved the provision of false information to public servants.

53     This principle is recognized in the case of _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> at \[25\], where the High Court held that the principle of general deterrence assumes significance and relevance where _inter alia_, the offence is difficult to detect. The offence of providing false information to public servants is difficult to detect as it takes a protracted time for the authorities to investigate before the truth can come to light.

#### Sentencing Precedents

54     For the seventh charge in _MAC 906931 of 2018_, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused instigated Liu Chuan to provide fake salary vouchers to the employment inspector in a bid to show that he had been receiving his salary in full and in so doing, had misled the Employment Inspector. The Prosecution had relied on an unreported case _PP v. Saxsena Manish Bhikhabhai_ MAC 909718 of 2018 (3 January 2019) in support of its sentencing position of two weeks’ imprisonment. The offender in that case consented to the company submitting fake salary vouchers indicating that his wife, Saxena Jihnasha Manish would be paid a monthly salary of $6,000 when she was never paid the said salary. Two weeks’ imprisonment was imposed when the accused pleaded guilty at first instance.

55     It was submitted that this was analogous to the present case where the Accused instigated Liu Chuan to provide fake salary vouchers to the Employment Inspector in order to show that he had been receiving his declared salary in full when this was not true.

56     For the ninth charge in _MAC 906927 of 2018_, the Prosecution had similarly submitted that a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for providing a false statement to the Employment Inspector. The Prosecution relied on an unreported case of _PP v. Noorul Ameen Mohamed Safiyudeen_ MAC 903223 of 2018 & Others (13 August 2020) in support of its sentencing. In that case, the offender had provided a false statement to the Employment Inspector and was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.

57     Once again, I was mindful the two unreported cases had little precedential value as there were no written grounds which explained the reasons for the sentence. Nevertheless, I agreed with the Prosecution custodial sentences of at least two weeks’ imprisonment were usually imposed when false statements were given to public servants. A sentence of one day’s imprisonment and the appropriate fine proposed by the Defence was clearly inadequate as the principle of deterrence must take centre stage in cases which involved the provision of false information to public servants.

58     I further agreed with the Prosecution that in the present case, there was nothing exceptional for the Court to depart from the established benchmark sentence for the provision of fake salary vouchers and provision of false statement to the Employment Inspector in order to mislead the Employment Inspector.

59     Accordingly, I was of the view that a custodial sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for each of the two charges was fair and justified. I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentences imposed should send a deterrent message to like-minded persons that such crimes will not be tolerated. The punishment imposed must persuade an accused to refrain from similar unlawful conduct.

## Conclusion

60     After having decided on the individual sentences, the next step was to decide on the global sentence. By virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), when a person is convicted and sentenced for at least three distinct offences, the court must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

61     In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a global sentence of at least ten weeks’ imprisonment by having the sentences for two of the charges ordered to run consecutively. In contrast while the Defence had urged the court to impose a global sentence of one day’s imprisonment and an appropriate fine, no submission was made on the appropriate individual sentences for each the proceeded charges.

62     After having regard to the totality of the offender’s conduct and his level of criminality, I was of the view that a global sentence of seven weeks’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in respect of the two charges under s 22(1)(_d_) EFMA and one charge under s 22(1)(_d_) read with s 23(1) EFMA. In my view a global sentence of one day’s imprisonment and the appropriate fine sought by the Defence would not have adequately reflected the overall criminality of the Accused’s conduct. I ordered the sentences for _MAC 906923 of 2018_ and _MAC 906931 of 2018_ to run consecutively in order to arrive at the global sentence of seven weeks’ imprisonment with the remaining charge in _MAC 906931 of 2018_ to run concurrently.
