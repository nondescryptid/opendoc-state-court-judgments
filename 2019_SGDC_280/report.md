The accused is one Lee Chuin Khuen, a 54-year old male, Singaporean, bearing NRIC No. XXX. He is also known as Henry Lee.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2. The accused was adjudicated a bankrupt on 27<sup>th</sup> November 2008. He was briefed of his duties and responsibilities as an undischarged bankrupt on 23<sup>rd</sup> December 2008. At all material times, the accused did not obtain leave from the High Court or seek written permission from the Official Assignee to be a director or to manage any business entity, whilst being an undischarged bankrupt.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3. The 1<sup>st</sup> co-accused is one Mohamed Zailani bin Mohamed Yasin (“Zailani”), a 40-year old, male, Malay Singaporean. Zailani was introduced to the accused by his brother-in-law.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4. The 2<sup>nd</sup> co-accused is one Yeo Kok Siong (“Yeo”), a 54-year old male, Singaporean. The accused became acquainted with Yeo sometime between 22<sup>nd</sup> October 2009 and 31<sup>st</sup> December 2009, when they were both serving their imprisonment sentence and were placed in the same prison cell. Whilst in Prison, the accused told Yeo that he was unable to set-up a company because he was a bankrupt.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5. The 3<sup>rd</sup> co-accused is one Ng Soh Khum (“Ng”), a 45-year old female, Singaporean. She is the accused’s wife.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>BACKGROUND</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6. Between 2010 and 2012, the Commercial Affairs Division (CAD) received a total of 52 police reports and two referrals from the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office (“IPTO”). These complaints were lodged in relation to the business activities of Glitterati Marketing &amp; Consultancy Pte Ltd (“Glitterati”), Lastminute Marketing &amp; Planning Pte Ltd (“Lastminute”) and Multipurpose Services Enterprise (“Multipurpose”). Investigations also revealed that, at the material time, the accused was involved in managing Tour &amp; Services Pte Ltd (“TSPL”).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Glitterati Marketing &amp; Consultancy Pte Ltd</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7. Glitterati was registered in Singapore on 3<sup>rd</sup> April 2009 as a limited exempt private company dealing with travel agencies and tour operators. Its registered address was at 20 Maxwell Road, #04-01A, Maxwell House, Singapore 069113. The company also registered as a travel agency with Singapore Tourism Board on 25<sup>th</sup> August 2009.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. Between 2009 and 2010, Glitterati sold travel memberships which allowed members to make travel bookings at discounted prices. Sales staff from Glitterati made ‘cold calls’ to potential clients and invited them down to Glitterati’s office to attend talks. The company promoted a “Royalez Privileges” membership which entitled members to discounted travel-related services such as tours, hotel accommodation and flights. Members paid between $2,500 and $15,000 for memberships which purportedly lasted between seven and thirty years.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. At the material time, the registered director and sole shareholder of Glitterati was Zailani. He was illiterate and did not have any experience in the travel industry. He was a director in name and was not involved in the day-to-day management of the company. Although Zailani received a monthly salary, he only worked as a cleaner. At all material times, the accused was the main operator of Glitterati.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10. The company ceased to operate on 1<sup>st</sup> March 2010 due to financial difficulties and its bank account was closed sometime in April 2010.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11. A total of 31 complaints were made to CAD in relation to Glitterati’s operations and the amount of membership fees paid was S$171,922/-.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Lastminute Marketing &amp; Planning Pte Ltd</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12. Shortly after his release from Prison, the accused contacted Yeo and asked his help to incorporate a company. The accused offered Yeo a sum of S$1,000/- per month for his assistance. Yeo agreed to this arrangement as he needed the monies. The accused then brought Yeo to ACRA and registered him both as director and shareholder of Lastminute. He also brought Yeo to open a corporate bank account and subsequently retained control of the company’s bank account.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13. Lastminute was registered in Singapore on 25<sup>th</sup> January 2010 as a limited exempt private company dealing with travel agencies and tour operators. Its registered address was at 101 Upper Cross Street #04-15, People’s Park Centre, Singapore 058357. Lastminute employed at least seven staff across three departments (sales, travel and administrative &amp; finance). Lastminute also registered as a travel agency with the Singapore Tourism Board from between 14 April 2010 to 30 December 2010.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14. Lastminute sold travel memberships which allowed members to make travel bookings at discounted prices. Potential customers would attend talks at Lastminute where the salespersons would introduce them to the “Integrated Lifestyle” membership. Members paid between $1,000/- and $15,000/- for memberships depending on the membership tier. At all material times, the accused was the main operator of Lastminute. Yeo did not exercise any supervision over the affairs of Lastminute.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15. On 6<sup>th</sup> December 2010, the company ceased to operate when Bailiffs stepped in to seize the company’s assets.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16. A total of 20 complaints were made to CAD in relation to Lastminute’s business operations alleging that they had received poor services and were cheated of their monies. The total amount of membership fees paid was S$90,645/-.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Tours &amp; Services Pte Ltd</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17. Whilst operating Lastminute, the accused decided to register another company called TSPL. The accused set-up TSPL in order to distinguish between the membership related travel business marketed by Lastminute and the customised travel bookings that were made on behalf of Lastminute’s customers.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">18. TSPL was registered in Singapore on 21<sup>st</sup> June 2010 as a limited exempt private company dealing with travel agencies and tour operators and general wholesale trade. Its registered address was at 101 Upper Cross Street #04-44, People’s Park Centre, Singapore 058357. This time, the accused registered his wife, Ng Soh Khum (“Ng”), as a director of the company. TSPL was also registered as a travel agency with the Singapore Tourism Board on 1<sup>st</sup> September 2010.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">19. At all material times, the accused was the main operator of TSPL although Ng was registered as the director of the company. Ng ceased to be a director of TSPL on 16<sup>th</sup> February 2011, shortly after the collapse of Lastminute’s business operations on 6<sup>th</sup> December 2010. TSPL was eventually taken over by some of its employees.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS RELATED TO THE 5</b> <sup>TH</sup> <b>CHARGE (DAC-912803-2019)</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">20. After the cessation of Lastminute’s business on 6<sup>th</sup> December 2010, the accused decided to enter into the business of selling smart equipment such as CCTVs and motion detectors. The accused approached one Sak Kwok Wah (“<b>Sak</b>”), who was a former employee at Lastminute, to help him register Multipurpose Services Enterprise (“<b>Multipurpose</b>”) as a sole proprietorship. At the material time, Sak was aware that the accused was a bankrupt.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">21. Multipurpose was subsequently registered on 8 December 2010 (two days after Lastminute had ceased operations) as a sole proprietorship and its registered address was 35 Selegie Road, #10-30, Parklane Shopping Mall, Singapore 188307. Shortly after its registration, Sak decided that he no longer wanted to be the registered owner of Multipurpose as he was concerned about being responsible for the business. On 28 December 2010, Yeo took over as the registered sole proprietor of Multipurpose.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">22. Both Sak and Yeo were the business owners of Multipurpose only in name. In actual fact, Multipurpose was managed and operated solely by the accused. Multipurpose had two businesses, namely the sale of smart equipment and the sale of ‘recovery services’ which was offered to the customers who had signed up for travel membership at Glitterati and/or Lastminute. The accused was responsible for hiring at least 8 staff to assist him with the sales operations and he managed both businesses at Multipurpose. The accused also managed the finances of the sole proprietorship. Although Yeo was the sole signatory of the entity’s bank account, Yeo had no control over the entity’s funds. Instead, he pre-signed the cheques based on the accused’s instructions. The debit card for the bank account was also held by the accused.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">23. Sometime towards end 2011, the accused decided to shutdown Multipurpose’s operations. The entity's bank account was also closed on 16 November 2011.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">24. Thus, whilst being an undischarged bankrupt, the accused did directly take part in the management of a sole proprietorship styled as Multipurpose Services Enterprises, without the leave of the High Court or the written permission of the Official Assignee between 8 December 2010 and 16 November 2011, in Singapore, and the accused has thereby committed an offence under Section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act (Chapter 32, 2004 Revised Edition).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS RELATED TO THE 7</b> <sup>TH</sup> <b>CHARGE (DAC-912806-2019)</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">25. Sometime in 2011, the accused bumped into Teh Siew Yee (“<b>Teh</b>”), a former customer of Lastminute. The accused subsequently arranged to meet up with Teh to discuss the investment he had made in Lastminute. At this meeting, the accused represented to Teh that Multipurpose would be able to help him recover $5,000 which he had invested to purchase a travel membership.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">26. At the material time, the accused knew that Lastminute had already ceased operations. The accused also did not inform Teh that he was a bankrupt and that he had previously managed Lastminute’s business. The accused deceived Teh into believing that Multipurpose was able to help him recover his investment from Lastminute, which fact the accused knew was false. Pursuant to the deception, the accused asked Teh to pay an administrative fee of $3,000 for the recovery services. The accused promised Teh that he would refund the $3,000 fee after he had recovered the $5,000 investment.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">27. On 4 July 2011, the accused issued a post-dated cheque for $8,000 to Teh. Upon receiving the post-dated cheque, Teh paid the accused $500 in cash and transferred the remaining $2,500 electronically to Multipurpose’s bank account on 7 July 2011. Teh was subsequently unable to bank in the cheque and/or make any contact with the accused or Multipurpose.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">28. Thus, the accused did deceive Teh into believing that Multipurpose would be able to help recover monies from Lastminute, which the accused knew was not true, and by such manner of deception, Teh was dishonestly induced to deliver to a sum of $3,000 to Multipurpose, which act is a cheating offence punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS RELATED TO THE 9</b> <sup>TH</sup> <b>CHARGE (DAC-912808-2019)</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">29. The accused hired two unidentified employees known as “John” and “Kathy” to work at Multipurpose. Under the accused’s directions, both “John” and “Kathy” targeted the former clients of Lastminute and sold them ‘recovery services’ for the investments they had made in Lastminute to purchase travel memberships.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30. At the material time, the accused knew that it was not possible to recover monies from Lastminute as the company had ceased operations. Despite knowing this, the accused instigated his employees by encouraging them to offer ‘recovery services’ to the clients of Lastminute. At the material time, the employees were unaware that he was an undischarged bankrupt.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">31. Sometime in 2011, Aini Binti Menwari (“<b>Aini</b>”), a former customer of Lastminute, received a call from Multipurpose. The caller informed Aini that the investment she had made in Lastminute could be recovered and persuaded her to come down to their office. On 28 October 2011, Aini went to Multipurpose’s office to meet “John”. “John” told Aini that if she paid $3,000, she could get back her money within two to three working days. “John” then gave Aini a post-dated cheque for $7,800. Upon receiving the post-dated cheque, Aini made a payment of $3,000 to Multipurpose. Aini was subsequently unable to bank in the post-dated cheque.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">32. Thus, the accused did abet by instigating a staff at Multipurpose known as “John”, to deceive Aini into believing that Multipurpose would be able to recover monies from Lastminute, which the accused knew was not true, and by such manner of deception, Aini was dishonestly induced into delivering $3,000 to Multipurpose, which act is a cheating offence punishable under Section 417 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>FACTS RELATED TO THE 11</b> <sup>TH</sup> <b>CHARGE (DAC-91810-2019)</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">33.

The caller informed Kee that they could assist her to recover the investments she had made in Lastminute and persuaded her to come down to their office.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">34. At the material time, the accused knew that it was not possible to recover monies from Lastminute as the company had ceased operations.

At the material time, the employees were unaware that the accused was an undischarged bankrupt.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">35. On 4 November 2011, Kee went to Multipurpose’s office and met “Kathy”. Kee told Kathy that sometime in 2010, she had lent $5,000 to the accused to pay the salaries of Lastminute’s employees. “Kathy” told Kee that she would ask Multipurpose’s boss to claim the monies from Lastminute. At the material time, Kee was unaware that the accused was managing Multipurpose.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">36. On 5 November 2011, “Kathy” called Kee and told her that she could get back the $5,000 if she paid an administrative fee of $5,000. “Kathy” assured Kee that the administrative fee of $5,000 would be refunded when her monies were recovered. On 9 November 2011, “Kathy” gave Kee a post-dated cheque of $10,000 and, in return, received $5,000 from Kee. Kee was subsequently unable to bank in the post-dated cheque.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">37. Thus, the accused did abet by instigating a staff of Multipurpose known as “Kathy”, to deceive Kee into believing that Multipurpose would be able to recover monies from Lastminute, which the accused knew was not true, and by such manner of deception, Kee was dishonestly induced into delivering $5,000 to Multipurpose, which act is a cheating offence punishable under Section 417 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Revised Edition).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>CONCLUSION</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">38.

## Reasons for the Sentence Imposed

## Offence under section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act

##### Factors to consider as set out in _Yap Guat Beng_

6       In the case of _Yap Guat Beng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 689</span>, it was held at \[39\] that “_the prohibition on managing a company or business (or being a director of a company) found in s 148(1) of the Companies Act and s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act is premised on protective considerations”._ The High Court added at \[40\] that “…_the predominant consideration in sentencing offenders for breach of s 148(1) of the Companies Act and s 26(1) of the Business Registration Act is to evaluate the applicability of the deterrent principle with a view to protecting the interests of creditors and the public from harm caused by the bankrupt’s management of the business”._

7       The High Court in _Yap_ further stated that “_as a starting point, if no harm was caused to anyone arising from the offence and there was no dishonest element in the commission of the offence, a fine would generally be sufficient_”. At \[41\], the High Court continued by listing aggravating circumstances which if one or more are present, would make a custodial sentence appropriate:

> (a)     The unlawful continuance of directorship and/or management of the company or business resulting in loss or harm suffered by innocent third parties who dealt with the company or business under the management of the undischarged bankrupt;

> (b)     The offence was committed with dishonest intention to cheat or defraud innocent third parties;

> (c)     The offender obtained personal gains or was enriched as a result of committing the offences;

> (d)     The flagrant or reckless disregard of the prohibition, such as the direct or indirect involvement in the incorporation of companies after the offender has already been made a bankrupt in order to circumvent the prohibition;

> (e)     The offence was committed in breach of an existing disqualification order made under sections 149, 149A and 154 of the Companies Act;

> (f)     The offence was committed over a prolonged period of time during which the offender was in active management; and

> (g)     The offender has antecedents of the same offence or related bankruptcy offences under the Bankruptcy Act, Companies Act and/or the Business Registration Act.

##### Several Aggravating Factors present

8       There were several aggravating factors present in this case.

#### Loss suffered by innocent third parties/Dishonest intention to defraud innocent third parties

9       The unlawful management of the Accused in the business of Multipurpose resulted in loss to innocent third parties and revealed a dishonest intention on the part of the Accused to defraud innocent third parties.

10     As background, it is necessary to set out the nature of the business of Glitterati and Lastminute. Between 2009 and 2010, Glitterati sold travel memberships which allowed members to make travel bookings at discounted prices. Members paid between $2,500 and $15,000 for memberships which purportedly lasted between seven and thirty years. When Glitterati ceased operations on 1 March 2010, a total of 31 complaints were made to CAD and the amount of memberships fees paid was $171,922[^2].

11     Lastminute was registered in Singapore on 25 January 2010 and offered the same type of travel memberships to customers, which allowed members to make travel bookings at discounted prices. Members paid between $1,000 and $15,000 for memberships, depending on the membership tier. The company ceased operations on 6 December 2010. A total of 20 complaints were made to CAD in relation to Lastminute’s business operations. The amount of membership fees paid was $90,645[^3].

12     This was the business landscape to which a key portion of Multipurpose’s business activity was directed at. The victims targeted by Multipurpose were former customers of Glitterati and Lastminute – companies which the Accused himself set up and personally managed. When Glitterati and Lastminute ceased operations and their customers were left stranded with no recourse (resulting in complaints to CAD), the Accused hired staff in Multipurpose to target these former customers of Glitterati and Lastminute by offering them “recovery” services of their original investments. At all material times, the Accused knew that it would be impossible for Multipurpose to assist his former customers to recover their original investments since both Glitterati and Lastminute had already ceased operations due to financial difficulties[^4]. The Accused, having managed both Glitterati and Lastminute would know that. On the facts of the case, it was clear what the Accused was seeking to do when he set up Multipurpose. His intention to defraud these innocent customers of Multipurpose was clear.

13     As a result of the Accused’s dishonest intention and through the vehicle of Multipurpose and its purported offering of “recovery” services, loss was occasioned to these innocent former customers of Glitterati/Lastminute. Even though the Accused had made full restitution to six ex-customers involved in the cheating charges, these victims continue to suffer losses from their earlier investments in travel memberships bought from Glitterati/Lastminute[^5]. The restitution made by the Accused demonstrated his remorse to some extent but I could not agree with Defence Counsel that it had the effect of downplaying the dishonest intention of the Accused at the material time[^6]. There may not be any conclusive evidence that the Accused obtained personal gain or was enriched as a result of this offence but it cannot be disputed that innocent third parties who dealt with the business when it was under the management of an undischarged bankrupt, had been harmed.

#### The Accused acted with flagrant disregard of the prohibition

14     The Accused acted with flagrant and reckless disregard of the prohibition expressed in the Business Registration Act. The Accused himself set up Multipurpose as a business and chose to directly take part in the management of Multipurpose despite being a bankrupt. It was undisputed that the Accused was the controlling mind of the business and played a key role in the management of Multipurpose. His involvement was neither incidental nor was it a case whereby he had stumbled into the business of Multipurpose. The Accused himself was responsible for hiring staff (at least 8 of them) to assist him with sales operations. He managed the finances of the business. Although Yeo was the sole signatory of the business’ bank account, Yeo had no control over its funds, having to pre-sign cheques on the Accused’s instructions. The debit card for the bank account was held by the Accused[^7]. It was obvious that the registered owners, first Sak and subsequently Yeo, were only business owners in name, put up by the Accused to circumvent the prohibition[^8].

15     In addition, I noted that prior to setting up Multipurpose, the Accused set up and operated three other travel related companies (Glitterati, Lastminute, TSPL – companies which formed the subject matter of the TIC charges under section 148 of the Companies Act), all of which were incorporated when the Accused was already a bankrupt[^9]. In respect of these companies, the Accused had similarly used the particulars of third parties, namely his employee (Zailani) and friend (Yeo) and his wife (Ng) to register the companies in order to evade the prohibition. In respect of Multipurpose, when Sak no longer wanted his name to be used as the registered owner of Multipurpose, the Accused replaced him with Yeo.

16     It was clear from the Accused’s conduct that he was well aware of the prohibition and deliberately took steps to circumvent it by using other persons to register the business/companies. He then sought to actively and directly manage the business activities from behind the scenes. I find the conduct of the Accused to be shockingly appalling.

#### Duration of Offence

17     The Accused actively and directly took part in the management of Multipurpose from 8 December 2010 to 16 November 2011, a period of about 11 months. Including the three other companies which the Accused had managed and operated whilst he was a bankrupt, it would be a total of 30 months[^10].

#### Antecedents

18     The Accused was not a first offender. He had antecedents of related bankruptcy offences. On 5 September 2013, the Accused was convicted on 4 counts of obtaining credit under section 141(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy Act and was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

##### Custodial threshold crossed

19     Having regard to the facts and circumstances in this case, and the sentencing considerations in _Yap_, I was amply satisfied that a custodial sentence was called for. A fine was wholly inappropriate. As stated in _Yap_ at \[32\]:

> “……._the prohibition of an undischarged bankrupt from managing (or being a director) of a company or a business serves not only to protect creditors’ interests; it also serves to safeguard the greater public interest to prevent an undischarged bankrupt from misusing the corporate structure for collateral purposes to the detriment of innocent third parties”._

20     The precedents tendered by the Prosecution under section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act and section 148 of the Companies Act where custodial terms had been imposed, showed a range of sentences between 4 weeks to 2 months’ imprisonment[^11]. Prosecution sought a custodial term of 4 months’ imprisonment for the Accused based on the aggravating factors present.

21     Defence Counsel, on the other hand, tendered a set of three precedents and argued that even in the most serious of cases, that of _Public Prosecutor v Cheong Boon Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 75</span>, where the offender claimed trial, had taken part in the management of a company as an undischarged bankrupt for about 17 months; the amounts involved was in excess of US$100,000 and no restitution had been made, he was only sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment. Defence Counsel submitted that a fine of $10,000 for the Accused in this current case was “_apposite_”[^12].

22     I found Defence Counsel’s submissions untenable. The precedents tendered by both Prosecution and the Defence were extremely helpful in giving the Court a flavour of the sentences imposed in similar cases but may all be distinguished[^13]. Even though the offence (whether under section 26(1) of the Business Registration or section 148 of the Companies Act) may be considered straightforward since it essentially concerned an individual being involved/taking part in the management of a company or a business while being an undischarged bankrupt, the appropriate sentence in each case turns on its own set of unique, specific facts. None of the precedents in which custodial terms were imposed, carried as many aggravating factors as the current case. None of the cases embodied similar specific facts that compelled adherence to the sentence imposed in the precedent case. In most of the precedent cases, the offenders had no related antecedents, unlike the Accused.

23     The Prosecution may only have proceeded on one charge which was under section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act but four other similar charges under section 148 of the Companies Act were admitted to and consented by the Accused to be taken into consideration. I was of the view that the conduct of the Accused, as encapsulated in the charges (both proceeded and taken into consideration), had to be considered in its entirety in order for the Court to properly and fully assess the overall criminality and culpability of the Accused. The charges taken into consideration under section 148 of the Companies Act were relevant to the proceeded charge under section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act and may be considered in the determination of the appropriate sentence on the charge proceeded on[^14].

24     I found the Accused to be highly culpable in this case. The timeline[^15] aptly and succinctly illustrated what the Accused did in the period after he was adjudged a bankrupt on 27 November 2008. Soon after he became a bankrupt, he set up Glitterati. After Glitterati ceased operations due to financial difficulties, he set up Lastminute, dealing in the same business. When that failed as well, the Accused set up Multipurpose as a business, offering “_recovery services_” for the members who had signed up for travel memberships with the previous two companies. I fully agreed with the Prosecution that the “_Accused’s conduct speaks for itself_[^16]”. It was necessary for the sentence imposed on this charge to reflect the gravity of the Accused’s conduct and to deter like-minded bankrupts who may be tempted to run companies and business whilst hiding behind such corporate structures. Bearing in mind that the Accused had pleaded guilty to the charge, I was of the view that 3 months’ imprisonment would be the appropriate sentence,

## Offences under section 417 of the Penal Code

25     Prosecution highlighted the case of _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span>[^17]. At \[47\], the learned Chief Justice stated:

> _“In my judgment, a custodial sentence will generally be appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value…..custodial sentences have been imposed where the section 417 offence in question for was committed for financial gain”._

26     In _Idya_, the High Court affirmed a sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment for a section 417 Penal Code offence involving a value of $10,509 (the offender had ordered $10,509 worth of electronic products and issued a dud cheque) and a sentence of 1 month’s imprisonment involving an amount of $1,800 under the same section (the amount was transferred to the offender on the promise of delivery of electronic items). The High Court agreed that the offender should be given credit for having made restitution but noted at \[45\] that in cases where restitution had been made “_on the advice of counsel with a calculated purposefulness in the hope of receiving a lighter sentence and that the timing of such restitution is a consideration to be taken into account_”[^18].

27     In this present case, the cheating charges were reduced from section 420 to section 417 of the Penal Code after the Accused made restitution to the six victims whom he had cheated.

28     The offences were committed sometime in late 2011. Accused was charged in court on 26 April 2019. There were seemingly no steps taken by the Accused to make restitution to any of the victims, in the interim period. The Accused only sought to make full restitution to the victims involved in the cheating charges after it was made known to him of the Prosecution’s offer to reduce the charges to simple cheating should he make restitution[^19]. By 16 September 2019, restitution had been fully made and the Accused’s guilty plea was recorded on section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act as well as the reduced charges under section 417 of the Penal Code. On these facts, it did appear that restitution had come rather late in the day. Notwithstanding, I was of the view that some weight may be placed on the restitution made by the Accused.

29     That said and despite the restitution, the level of premeditation involved in the cheating charges cannot be disregarded. Two days after Lastminute ceased operations on 6 December 2010, the Accused set up Multipurpose and he offered recovery services to the same set of customers[^20] by deceiving them into believing that he could help them to recover certain amounts from their membership with Glitterati or Lastminute. Only the Accused would know this - that the customers of Glitterati and Lastminute had made losses in the travel memberships when both the companies ceased their operations - and he preyed on them and their needs. He arranged to meet up with Teh to discuss the investment Teh had made in Lastminute[^21]; he instructed Multipurpose staff to call up former customers (such contact information which would be available to Multipurpose only because they were former customers of the companies which the Accused previously managed) to inform them they had such “_recovery services_”[^22]. The Accused employed staff, trained and instigated them to perpetuate his web of deceit.

30     The Accused dealt personally with one Teh Siew Yee (DAC 912806/2019) and at no time did the he reveal to Teh that he was a bankrupt or that he had previously managed Lastminute’s business[^23]. When one Kee Bee Lee met up with “Kathy”, a staff of Multipurpose and told “Kathy” that she had lent money to the Accused to pay the salaries of Lastminute, “Kathy” informed her that she would ask “_Multipurpose’s boss_”[^24] to claim the monies from Lastminute. At no time was Kee aware that the Accused (to whom she had lent money to) was in fact “_Multipurpose’s boss_” and the one managing Multipurpose[^25]. Such was the web of deceit spun by the Accused.

31     Apart from the facts above:-

> a)     The amounts involved in the cheating charges may not be described as negligible – they were in the amounts of $3000 (DAC 912806/2019 and DAC 912808/2019) and $5000 in DAC 91810/2019. The value of the property involved would often be the primary yardstick, even though not the only one[^26].

> b)     These cheating charges were not the Accused’s first convictions for cheating offences. The Accused had similar antecedents for cheating and criminal breach of trust in 2000.

32     Noting the aggravating factors present in this case and the manner in which the Accused had cheated his victims, I was fully satisfied that a custodial term was necessary. I sentenced the Accused to the following:

> DAC 912806/2019 (value of $3000) – 2 months’ imprisonment

> DAC 912808/2019 (value of $3,000) – 2 months’ imprisonment

> DAC 91810/2019 (value of $5,000) – 10 weeks’ imprisonment

33     I ordered the sentences imposed in respect of section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act and DAC 91810/2019 to run consecutively, making it an aggregate sentence of 3 months and 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Total Sentence

34     The punishment for an offence under section 26(1) of the Business Registration Act was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. Section 417 of the Penal Code prescribes a punishment of imprisonment for a maximum of 3 years, or with fine, or both. The individual sentences imposed on the Accused in respect of the various charges are at the lower range of the spectrum of custodial sentences envisaged by legislation, having taken into account the facts and circumstances of the case.

35     When one considers the entire enterprise which the Accused had involved himself in soon after he was adjudged a bankrupt – setting up companies, a business, putting up third parties as registered owners and running the operations from behind the scenes, cheating innocent victims in the process – it cannot be said that the aggregate sentence of 3 months and 10 weeks’ imprisonment is manifestly excessive. In keeping with the totality principle, this was an aggregate sentence that was in accord with the overall criminality and culpability demonstrated by the Accused’s conduct.

## Conclusion

36     The imprisonment terms have been stayed and the Accused is currently on bail, pending the hearing of this appeal.
