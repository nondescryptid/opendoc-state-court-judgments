Criminal Law – Offences – Hurt

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9872/2020/01.\]

9 December 2020

### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       The accused Chen Xu Jia was involved in a dispute at home on the evening of 21 January 2019 with her husband, which escalated into fighting involving five family members. All five of them eventually suffered injuries of varying severity. The accused was charged with causing hurt to her mother-in-law Ding Xia, Chinese national aged 67 years, by punching the latter’s head and eye region, scratching her left eye region and biting her left arm several times.

2       The accused pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt to her mother-in-law under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). I sentenced the accused to an imprisonment term of one week, and the accused appealed my sentence.

## The Charge

3       The accused pleaded guilty to the following:

> MCN-901719-2019

> You, \[…\] are charged that you, on 21 January 2019, at or after 7.15pm, at Block 257C Compassvale Road #XXX Singapore 543257, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Ding Xia by punching her head and eye region, scratching her left eye region, and biting her left arm several times, with the intention of thereby causing hurt to Ding Xia, causing Ding Xia to sustain (a) bilateral periorbital bruising with multiple scratch marks in the periorbital region, (b) a left conjunctival laceration, and (c) bodily pain on the left arm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

4       The offence is punishable with an imprisonment term of up to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5000, or with both.

## Material Facts

5       The accused aged 38 years is a Singapore citizen. The other four family members involved in the incident were:

> (a)     Zhao Ting, a 39-year-old male Singaporean and the accused’s then-husband (“the husband”).

> (b)     Ding Xia, a 67-year-old female Chinese national, the husband’s mother and victim in the charge against the accused (“her mother-in-law”).

> (c)     Chen Limin, a 65-year-old male Chinese national and the accused’s father (“her father”).

> (d)     Zhang Ling, a 66-year-old female Chinese national and the accused’s mother (“her mother”).

6       On the evening of 21January 2019, the accused and the husband argued. A fight broke out between the husband and her father in the master bedroom. When the accused sought to intervene in the fight between the husband and her father, a struggle and fight broke out between the accused and her mother-in-law. The husband, her mother-in-law and her father now also face pending charges relating to the incident. Her mother who was punched by the husband has not been charged.

7       The detailed facts extracted from the Statement of Facts admitted without qualification by the accused are set out below.

8       At about 7.25pm that evening, a female caller called ‘999’ to say “faster come…fighting fighting”. The incident location was given as Block 257C Compassvale Road #XXX Compassvale Gardens, Singapore 543257 (“the unit”).

9       That evening at about 7.15pm in the unit, the accused and the husband got into an argument about the care of their younger daughter. Subsequently the husband carried the said daughter to the master bedroom, wanting to take her temperature in the toilet of the master bedroom. The accused followed the husband into the master bedroom.

10     Her father and her mother-in-law heard the argument between the accused and the husband and also went into the master bedroom. Her father and her mother-in-law then took out their mobile phones to record videos of the argument between the accused and the husband. In the course of jostling into position to do so, her father accidentally nudged her mother-in-law against a cabinet.

11     A fight broke out between the husband and her father in the master bedroom, which continued in the corridor outside the master bedroom. The husband punched the accused’s father in the head, eyes and chest region several times, and also bit her father’s right forearm and left ear. At some point, the accused’s mother-in-law also punched her father on the nose area, and her father pushed her mother-in-law causing the latter to fall and knock the back of her head against a table.

12     Th accused’s mother also went into the master bedroom after hearing the commotion. The husband punched her mother on the head and eye region several times.

13     When the accused tried to intervene in the fight between her father and the husband, she was stopped by her mother-in-law who pushed the accused towards the bed in the master bedroom. A struggle ensued between the two and a fight broke out between the accused and her mother-in-law in the master bedroom, which continued in the corridor outside the master bedroom. In the course of the fight:

> (a)     Her mother-in-law grabbed the accused’s hair and knocked the accused’s head against the floor a few times.

> (b)     The accused punched her mother-in-law in the head and eye region, scratched her left eye region, and bit her left arm several times. The accused had done the said acts with the intention of thereby causing hurt to her mother-in-law.

14     After police officers arrived at the unit, the accused, the husband, her father and her mother were conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital (“**SKGH**”) by ambulance. The accused’s mother-in-law was conveyed to Changi General Hospital (“**CGH**”) by ambulance.

15     The CGH medical report of the accused’s mother-in-law dated 1 February 2019 from the Department of Surgery (“**the CGH report**”) states that her mother-in-law had the following injuries:

> (a)     Bilateral periorbital bruising with multiple scratch marks in the periorbital region,

> (b)     Occipital laceration,

> (c)     Right parietal hematoma,

> (d)     Microhyphema and left conjunctival laceration.

16     The CGH report also states that her mother -in-law was admitted to the general surgery ward on 22 January 2019:

> (a)     Her upper limb wounds were dressed and she was started on a course of antibiotics.

> (b)     Her occipital laceration was stitched in the emergency department.

> (c)     She was noted to have rising creatinine kinase trend and was advised to stay inpatient for intravenous hydration and monitoring, however, she declined further inpatient care and was discharged against advice on 24 January 2019.

17     The SKGH medical report of the accused from the Department of Emergency Medicine dated 8 February 2019 states that she had the following injuries:

> (a)     Soft hematomas noted over the bi-parietal scalp regions,

> (b)     Superficial abrasion over the left hand thenar region,

> (c)     Bruising over the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) regions over the dorsum of the left hand.

18     The SKGH medical report of the accused’s father dated 15 February 2019 from the Department of Emergency Medicine states that he had the following injuries:

> (a)     Left inferior orbital contusion hematoma extending to left maxillary region,

> (b)     Deep lacerated wound on left ear antitragus region with exposure of the cartilage, with active bleeding, about 2.5cm length,

> (c)     Mild redness on anterior neck about 3cm x 1cm,

> (d)     Bite mark with swelling on right forearm – medial area, distal half (about 4cm),

> (e)     Mild redness on right knee,

> (f)     Contusion hematoma on right hand, dorsal area 3rd, 4th and 5th metacarpal region extending to metatarsophalangeal joint,

> (g)     Mild abrasions on right elbow,

> (h)     Blood tinge on left nostril,

> (i)     Point tenderness on neck, posterior midline region,

> (j)     Point tenderness on sternal area of chest.

19     The SKGH medical report of her father dated 15 February 2019 from the Department of General Surgery states that the father had the following injuries:

> (a)     Human bite laceration over the left ear,

> (b)     Left orbital region hemotama,

> (c)     Left orbital floor fracture extending to anterior maxillary wall,

> (d)     Contusion hematoma over the right hand,

> (e)     Left sided epistaxis.

20     The SKGH medical report of the accused’s mother dated 11 February 2019 from the Department of Surgery states that her mother had the following injuries:

> (a)     Acute right orbital “blow-out” fracture with displaced fractures involving the right lamina papyracea and orbital floor including the infra-orbital canal,

> (b)     Herniation of the intra-orbital fat and right inferior rectus muscle at the fracture site without entrapment.

21     The SKGH medical report of her mother dated 12 February 2019 from the Department of Emergency Medicine states that her mother had the following injuries:

> (a)     Acute subdural hemorrhage,

> (b)     Fracture of the right orbital floor and right lamina papyracea with inferior herniation of orbital fat and inferior rectus muscle,

> (c)     Right 4th and 5th finger bruise.

22     The SKGH medical report of the husband dated 15 February 2019 from the Department of Emergency Medicine states that the husband had the following injuries:

> (a)     Bruise over left forehead and eyebrow region with superficial laceration over left forehead measured around 2cm,

> (b)     Tenderness over right anterior chest,

> (c)     Tenderness over left elbow with bruise, with full range of movement,

> (d)     Tenderness over left hand dorsum with swelling, with full range of movement,

> (e)     Scratch marks over left shoulder and face,

> (f)     Tenderness over left testis, no swelling.

23     By punching her mother-in-law’s head and eye region, scratching her left eye region, and biting her left arm several times, with the intention of causing hurt, the accused had voluntarily caused hurt to her mother-in-law and caused her to sustain (a) bilateral periorbital bruising with multiple scratch marks in the periorbital region, (b) a left conjunctival laceration, and (c) bodily pain on the left arm. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

## Antecedents

24     The accused was untraced.

## Prosecution’s submissions for at least one week’s imprisonment

25     Prosecution tendered skeletal submissions with a table of sentencing precedents. They submitted that the accused should be sentenced to at least one week’s imprisonment.

26     Prosecution stated that based on the sentencing guidelines in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 526</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”), at the first step, even though the harm caused technically fell within band 2 moderate harm because of her mother-in-law’s short hospitalisation stay, the harm should nevertheless be considered as in the middle to upper range of band 1 low harm. The injuries suffered were not particularly serious or long-term and the hospitalisation was for observation purposes. A starting point of at least one week’s imprisonment was therefore appropriate.

27     At the second step, the accused’s culpability should be regarded as moderate to high as her attack was directed at a vulnerable area of her mother-in-law’s body. However as the accused did not appear to have initiated the violence and she had also sustained violence from her mother-in-law. Prosecution was therefore not seeking an uplift of the indicative starting point of one week’s imprisonment.

## Mitigation

28     In the written mitigation Counsel submitted for a minimal fine.

29     On the evening of the incident, the accused had a dispute with the husband over their daughter who was having a fever. A scuffle broke out after the husband threw the accused onto the floor of the master bedroom, and she sustained blisters on her palm as well as bruises over her arms. Her mother-in-law had grabbed the accused’s hair and knocked her head against the floor a few times. The accused sustained a mild concussion and was hospitalised for a day. She was still suffering the side effects from the concussion, experiencing sudden dizziness and white outs from time to time.

30     The accused’s parents were also both injured in the incident. Her father was hit in the nose till he bled, he was bitten on his left ear and right forearm, and suffered injuries to his face and eyes. The injuries sustained by her father resulted in 3 days hospitalisation. Her mother was treated for 11 days in Singapore, and due to the staggering medical fees, she returned to China to receive treatment and undergo surgery. Graphic photographs of the injuries sustained by the accused and her parents were enclosed.

31     Counsel urged the court to consider the accused’s domestic circumstances in sentencing. The accused was married to the husband for 12 years. The relationship broke down and matters escalated sometime around 2011, and parties underwent divorce proceedings in November 2018. The accused has lived in a loop of endless domestic violence which had caused her physical and mental stress. The husband and her mother-in-law had been aggressive and violent towards the accused and her parents. This resulted in the accused feeling fearful and distressed. The mitigation then detailed the various injuries that the accused sustained in five incidents between 2011 and 2019, with police and hospital reports enclosed.

32     Like Prosecution, Counsel also submitted that the harm caused to the victim fell within band 1 low harm of the sentencing framework. As the accused’s mother-in-law sustained lesser injuries than the victim in _Low Song Chye_, the starting point sentence should be lower than the four months meted out to the accused in _Low Song Chye_.

33     As the scuffle was not initiated by the accused and she had also sustained violence from her mother-in-law, and because she had been suffering hurt and harm in an endless loop of domestic violence, adjustments should be made to the indicative starting point sentence so that the accused pays a minimal fine.

34     This was the accused’s first offence, she had pleaded guilty and was deeply remorseful for her actions. It was a domestic altercation that was not initiated by the accused. Parties are now divorced and living separately and the actions would not happen again. Each parent had custody of one child and contact would be minimal. There would be no one to look after the child if a jail term was imposed. The accused undertook never to allow herself to get into similar circumstances again, and she was not a hardened criminal.

## _Low Song Chye_ sentencing framework for s323 offences

35     The High Court in _Low Song Chye_ prescribed three broad sentencing bands providing indicative sentencing ranges based on the level of hurt caused in the offence for first-time offenders who pleaded guilty: \[77\] and \[78\]. The court is to undertake a two-step inquiry:

> (a)     First, to derive the appropriate indicative starting point, the court is to identify the applicable sentencing band and where the offence falls within the indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused.

> (b)     Second, the court is to make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors, including the aggravating and mitigating factors identified in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“_BDB_”), which may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range.

## Issues to be determined

36     The issues for determination by the court were as follows:

> (a)     The applicable sentencing band and where the offence lies within the indicative sentencing range.

> (b)     The adjustments to be made to indicative sentence taking into account culpability, and all relevant mitigating and aggravating factors.

## Issue 1: Applicable sentencing band and where the offence lies within the indicative sentencing range

### Three-day hospitalisation for observation

37     Not all the injuries suffered by her mother-in-law that evening were caused by the accused, as her mother-in-law was involved in physical scuffles with both the accused and her father. According to the statement of facts, the accused caused the bilateral periorbital bruising with multiple scratch marks in the periorbital region, a left conjunctival laceration, and bodily pain on the left arm by punching, scratching and biting her mother-in-law.

38     The CGH medical report dated 1 February from the Department of Surgery stated that her mother-in-law was admitted to the general surgery ward on 22 January 2019 for observation. She was referred to the ophthalmologist for review, and offered surgery for the conjunctival laceration but declined. She was also noted to have a rising creatinine kinase trend and advised to stay inpatient for intravenous hydration and monitoring. She however also declined inpatient care and was discharged against advice on 24 January 2019.

39     Under band 2 of _Low Song Chye_, moderate harm includes cases of injuries that result in hospitalization for a short time and\\or a substantial period of medical leave. Prosecution had submitted that the injuries should be considered as being in the middle to upper range of Band 1, despite the three-day hospitalisation which was for the purposes of observation rather than treatment and the injuries suffered were not particularly serious or long-term.

40     In my view, it was relevant to the assessment of the severity of the injuries suffered by a victim that a medical professional had considered the injuries serious enough to require the victim to be warded for medical observation over three days. It indicated that the victim’s medical condition and injuries required in-patient monitoring and observation, and they were not insignificant nor minor as to warrant out-patient treatment and discharge. In this case the victim had also discharged herself against medical advice after the three-day hospitalization. _Low Song Chye_ itself did not make a distinction between short hospital stays for observation and short hospital stays for treatment, and band 2 moderate harm included cases where the victim had not been hospitalized but given substantial periods of medical leave. In cases of both hospitalization and discharge with medical leave, the victim has been medically assessed to be unable to carry out his usual daily activities.

41     That said, in this case the three-day hospitalization stay should not be regarded as a direct proxy of the degree of hurt caused by the accused. Not only would the length of hospitalization depend on other factors like the personal characteristics of the patient, and her mother-in-law was elderly, she had also suffered other injuries such as the occipital laceration that required stitching that were not attributable to the accused. Therefore the three-day hospitalization stay could not be ascribed solely to the harm inflicted by the accused.

### Level of harm inflicted crossed the custodial threshold

42     The three sentencing bands in _Low Song Chye_ are classified according to the level of hurt caused :

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.2232446489298%"> <col width="48.6697339467894%"> <col width="35.1070214042809%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Hurt caused</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative sentencing range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low harm: no visible injury or minor hurt such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines or short custodial term up to four weeks</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Serious harm: serious injuries which are permanent in nature and/or which necessitate significant surgical procedures</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Between six to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

43     Band 1 for low harm includes cases where the hurt caused is minor, such as bruises, scratches, minor lacerations or abrasions, and band 2 for moderate harm includes cases of simple fractures, temporary or mild loss of hearing or sight, or hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave. Once the court decides which sentencing band the case falls into, its next task is to consider where the case is situated within the applicable indicative sentencing range, having regard to the relative severity of the hurt sustained compared to the other forms of hurt within that sentencing band, having regard to the relevant sentencing precedents: \[80\], \[83\] and \[88\].

44     I agreed with parties that the hurt caused should be classified under band 1. The victim in _Low Song Chye_ had suffered a left anterior central tympanic membrane perforation and underwent tympanoplasty to close the eardrum perforation. She also suffered mild loss of hearing and tinnitus, and her injury had been classified as being in the bottom of band 2. In this case there was no medical evidence that the accused’s mother-in-law had suffered any temporary or mild loss of sight. Further for the reasons stated at \[41\] above, I was of the view that in this case the three-day hospitalization though relevant to assessing the level of harm caused, should not be used for the purposes of classifying the level of hurt caused under band 2.

45     Band 1 carried an indicative sentencing range of fines or jail up to 4 weeks. As to where the offence fell within the applicable sentencing range, having regard to the nature and severity of the injuries caused to the accused relative the other forms of hurt under this band, I was of the view that this case fell within the upper range of band 1. Her mother-in-law had suffered bilateral periorbital bruising with multiple scratch marks in the periorbital region, a left conjunctival laceration, and bodily pain on the left arm. The periorbital bruising extended across the region of both eyes, and the conjunctival laceration was considered medically serious enough for surgery by an ophthalmologist. Her medical condition required in-patient monitoring for three-days and she had discharged against medical advice. The injuries could not be considered minor lacerations or bruises lying on the lower end of the scale of injuries in band 1. The custodial threshold had been crossed and I agreed with Prosecution that the harm caused would warrant an indicative starting point sentence of at least one week’s jail.

## Issue 2: Adjustments to be made to the indicative starting point sentence

46     At this second step, the court is to assess the accused’s culpability and all relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.

### Matters raised by Counsel in mitigation

47     I accepted as mitigating that that the accused had pleaded guilty and she was a first offender. However these two factors would not warrant any downwards adjustment of the indicative starting point sentence of a custodial term as the _Low Song Chye_ indicative sentencing ranges applied to first-time offenders who pleaded guilty.

48     Counsel further raised a number of matters in mitigation that had no bearing on mitigation or the accused’s culpability.

49     He referred to the injuries suffered by the accused’s parents which were accompanied by graphic photographs of their injuries. Whilst they gave a fuller picture of the acrimony and ferocity of what had happened that evening, her parents’ injuries could not have any mitigating value in the accused’s favour, being unrelated to the injuries the accused herself inflicted on her mother-in-law. The accused’s father himself was a co-accused in the physical altercation and faced pending charges himself.

50     Then Counsel said the scuffle had broken out after the husband threw the accused onto the floor of the master bedroom, when they were arguing about their younger daughter. This was disputed by Prosecution as being inconsistent with the statement of facts and not borne out by police investigations. In any event this was unrelated to the assault on her mother-in-law which occurred subsequently, nor would it be of any mitigating value or lessen the accused’s culpability for the assault on her mother-in-law.

51     Counsel also raised that the accused was a battered wife and had been living in an endless loop of domestic violence. He said matters escalated between them in 2011, and both the husband and her mother-in-law had been aggressive and violent to the accused and her parents. The accused had custody of one daughter and a custodial sentence would serve no purpose.

52     Prosecution objected to the allegations of past violence. The court was not adjudicating on the wrongs inflicted by one party over the other and in any event the incidents cited pre-dated the offence and Counsel had not shown why they should be considered mitigating. As for the care of the child Prosecution said the accused’s father was still in Singapore, and hardship caused by a short custodial term they were seeking was not a mitigating factor unless the circumstances were exceptional.

53     I agreed with Prosecution. As the court observed in _BDB_ the difficult personal circumstances faced by an accused at the time of the offence will rarely if ever have any mitigating value: \[75\]. Any past physical incidents involving the husband and her mother-in-law were by themselves of no mitigating value to the present offence committed by the accused. Neither would any hardship to an accused’s child-care arrangements arising from a short jail term be considered exceptional hardship that carried mitigating weight.

### Prosecution’s sentencing table

54     Prosecution tendered a table of sentencing precedents (“table”), comprising one High Court decision and five unreported State Courts cases. Prosecution submitted that in the four cases in the table involving family violence - _PP v Satesh s\\o Navarian_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 119</span> (“Satesh”), _PP v Yap Bei Xing_ (MAC 911239-2019) (“_Yap Bei Xing_”), _PP v Hamdan Bin Omar_ (MAC 911952-2018) (“_Hamdan_”), and _PP v Thiruchelvam Maniam_ ( MAC 911971-2017) (“_Thiruchelvam_”) - the accused persons had been sentenced to at least 3 weeks jail.[^1] The two cases in the table where fines were imposed did not involve hurt between family members: _PP v Joanne Teo Qian Ting_ (MAC 901609-2019) (“_Joanne Teo_”) and _PP v Lim Boon Khiang_ (MCN 900665-2020)(“_Lim Boon Khiang_”).[^2]

55     I deal first with the reported High Court decision of _Satesh_. The accused pleaded guilty to two charges: the first for breaching a personal protection order and the second for causing hurt to his wife, with another hurt charge taken into consideration. The accused had returned home intoxicated in the early morning hours, entered the bedroom and without provocation grabbed the wife’s blanket and bit her leg in the presence of their five-year-old daughter. Ten minutes later the parties argued and the accused threw several punches at his wife, including one on her left cheek, and swung an umbrella to hit her on both flanks. The latter acts formed the subject-matter of the hurt charge to which the accused had pleaded guilty.

56     On appeal the High Court set aside the sentences of a Short Detention Order of 14 days and Day Reporting Order of 9 months. Jail sentences of three and five weeks were ordered for the breach of PPO and hurt charge respectively, with both sentences to run concurrently.

57     The High Court at \[22\] to \[26\] stated that the offences committed did not fall under the categories for which community sentences were envisaged and there was nothing to suggest that the accused’s capacity for rehabilitation was so promising for community sentences to be imposed. The accused had a history of alcohol abuse and propensity for violence and there was a clear need for punishment. The High Court then noted the strong stance taken against family violence citing cases where custodial sentences had been imposed for family violence, including _Luan Yuanxin_ where the court had stressed the importance of deterrence in familial violence:

> Violent acts such as these are particularly heinous when they are committed within the confines of a familial relationship as they constitute an abuse of the bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between family members. More often than not, the effects of such violence within the family fall most harshly upon the children who, while they may not be the direct recipients of the violence, will nevertheless carry the scars of these acts of brutality.

58     Apart from including _Satesh_ in the table, Prosecution had not expressly referred to _Satesh_ in their submissions. Although _Satesh_ preceded _Low Seng Chye_, in my view a custodial sentence similar to the five week jail term would be reached applying the _Low Song Chye_ framework. Although the wife’s injuries of tenderness and contusions on her face, neck and chest wall would have fallen within band 1, there were numerous offence and offender aggravating factors in _Satesh_, taken with the particular need for deterrence as the case involved family violence committed in the presence of their daughter. _Low Song Chye_ at \[81\] had noted that there would be cases where minor harm is caused but the custodial threshold is crossed whereby a jail term of up to or even in excess of 4 weeks jail may be warranted, due for example a particular need for deterrence resulting from for example the offender’s antecedents or the need to protect a specific category of victim

59     As regards the five unreported cases in the table, in the three cases involving violence between persons in a familial or quasi familial relationship (that is, _Yap Bei Xing_, _Hamdan_ and _Thiruchelvam_) sentences of between 3 weeks to 8 weeks’ jail were imposed on the accused persons. In the two non-familial cases (Joanne _Teo_ and _Lim Boon Khiang_ ) where fines were imposed, I agreed with Prosecution that deterrence was less significant in cases not involving family violence, and the victims in these two cases had also suffered lesser harm than the accused’s mother-in-law. The victim in _Joanne Teo_ had suffered a right ring laceration, while the victim in _Lim Boon Khiang_ had suffered lacerations on his left parietal scalp and central forehead which were sutured, and he was discharged. I did not take it that Prosecution was submitting that custodial sentences would invariably be imposed for cases of family violence. In my view whether an offence involving family violence merits a custodial sentence or not should be assessed on a case by case using the _Low Seng Chye_ framework, taking into account whether there would be special considerations of deterrence when adjusting the indicative sentence.

60     The five unreported decisions in the table were of limited precedent value without the reasoning as to what had weighed with the court. That aside, the attacks perpetuated by the accused persons in these five cases involved widely dissimilar factual matrices, levels of harm and culpability. Neither did any of the cases involve an accused person causing harm during a fight which was not initiated by them. Two of the unreported cases, _Hamdan_ and _Thiruchelvam_, pre-dated _Low Song Chye_ and the sentences were passed without the benefit of the sentencing framework. I did not find the unreported cases of much assistance. I propose to deal only with _Yap Bei Xing[^3]_ as it was the only unreported decision in the table involving family violence decided post-_Low Song Chye_, and Prosecution had briefly referenced this case in submission.

61     The victim was the 68-year-old father of the accused son. In the early morning hours, the accused was intoxicated and talking and complaining. The victim told the accused he wanted to sleep and went to lie down on the sofa. The accused proceeded to punch the victim’s face several times while he was lying on the sofa. When the victim moved away, the accused threw a coffee-table at the victim which grazed his shoulder. The accused then grabbed the victim’s earlobes and proceeded to push his face into the window grilles.

62     The accused who was untraced pleaded guilty to two charges, one under s336(a) for rash act endangering life by throwing the coffee-table, for which he was fined. For punching, grabbling the victim’s earlobes and pushing his face against the window grilles, the accused was sentenced to 3 weeks’ jail. The victim suffered frontal hairline scalp laceration, minor head injury, ear lobe, and right posterior pinna. His wounds were sutured, and he was given 3 days medical leave and 7 days light duty.

63     According to the court minute sheet, prosecution had submitted that although the harm caused would fall under band 1 in the sentencing framework, there were a series of aggravating factors for which a custodial sentence was warranted. The attack was unprovoked, the victim was elderly and he had been assaulted in his own home by his son who was intoxicated. The accused had attacked the victim on his face, a vulnerable part of the body, and this was when the victim was lying on the sofa and could not escape. The duration of attack was not short as the accused returned to press the victim’s face into the window grilles after the initial assault.

### Assessment of the accused’s culpability, and relevant mitigating and aggravating factors

64     Counsel submitted that the accused was deeply remorseful. The court in _Chen Weixiong Jerrick_ v PP \[2003\]2 SLR (R) 334 had observed that whilst there is common practice in pleas for leniency to glibly state that an accused is remorseful when the strong arm of the law has caught up with an accused, remorse is considered a mitigating factor where there is evidence of genuine compunction or remorse on the part of the offender. Apologetic gestures must be carefully scrutinized to see whether they constitute evidence of genuine heartfelt remorse: \[22\] and \[23\]. In this case Counsel did not surface any particular apologetic gestures on the part of the accused to support the claim that she was remorseful. This notwithstanding, I took the accused’s timely plea of guilt as some evidence that she was remorseful and gave it mitigating value.

65     As regards the circumstances of the commission of the offence, it was relevant to the issue of the accused’ culpability that the hurt had been inflicted in the context and heat of a fight where both parties had inflicted injuries on each other, and that the physical altercation was not initiated by the accused. It had not been argued that the accused acted under any provocation. However in considering the context of the attack, I took into account that preceding the fight that erupted between them, her mother-in-law had pushed the accused towards the bed in the master bedroom when the accused was attempting to intervene in the fight between the husband and her father. Whatever her mother-in-law’s reasons or motives for pushing the accused, her use of physical means could be perceived as aggressive and provocative.

66     However against this there were several culpability-enhancing factors against the accused. First as regards the manner of the attack, this was not a brief physical altercation. The accused had punched her mother-in-law’s head and eye region, scratched her left eye region and bitten her left arm several times in a fight that had started in the master bedroom and continued in the corridor outside the master bedroom. It was not disputed that the punching, scratching and biting were all inflicted with the intent to cause hurt. Second there were a number of injuries inflicted on her mother-in-law’s head and eye region. The accused had focused her attack on the vulnerable parts of her mother-in-law’s body. Third, the accused’s mother-in-law was 67 years old and an elderly victim. Although her mother-in-law was no hapless victim but one capable of using forceful measures herself, the accused had nevertheless carried out a sustained attack during a fight to hurt an elderly victim who was more than 25 years older than her.

67     Prosecution had submitted that the accused’s culpability was moderate to high. Overall I was of the view that her culpability lay in the moderate range. I agreed with Prosecution that the aggravating factors in \[66\] above would in-principle merit an uplift of the indicative starting sentence of at least one week’s jail, but these would have to be balanced against the considerations in her favour in \[64\] and \[65\] above.

### Custodial sentence appropriate

68     Counsel’s submission for a minimal fine was legally untenable. The mitigating factors in the accused’s favour were not so weighty as to negate both the culpability-enhancing features requiring an uplift of the sentence and then further reduce the indicative starting sentence. This would wrongfully scale down and minimize the harm the accused had caused as well as her culpability. At the most favourable to the accused, it was arguable that the mitigating factors at \[64\] and \[65\] could be considered as cancelling out the culpability-enhancing factors in \[66\], which would leave us with the indicative starting point of one week’s jail.

69     While specific deterrence would assume less significance as parties are now divorced and contact between the parties would be reduced, deterrence both general and specific remained relevant considerations. The accused had used deliberate and harsh physical force with the intention to cause hurt to her mother-in-law, in the context of a domestic dispute amidst strained and tense family relations. The level of violence involved went beyond a physical scuffle or a brief physical altercation between the parties and could not be considered minor. A fine was inappropriate and would not reflect the gravity of the accused’s acts.

70     As for the length of the custodial sentence, I was of the view that the accused was not as culpable as the accused in _Yap Bei Xing_ who was sentenced to three week’s jail for assaulting his father. The elderly victim in _Yap Bei Xing_ had been treated as an out-patient and discharged with medical leave. However even if the level of harm caused in _Yap Bei Xing_ and the present case were considered similar, the series of offender and offence specific aggravating features present in _Yap Bei Xing_ exceeded that in the present case. As for _Satesh_ where a five week jail term had been imposed even though the injuries suffered by the wife were lesser than that suffered by the victim in the present case, deterrence was a more significant consideration in _Satesh_. The accused in _Satesh_ had a personal protection order issued against him, he was intoxicated and had a history of alcohol abuse and propensity for violence.

71     In this case the level of hurt caused did not reach the extent of the injuries suffered by the victim in _Low Song Chye_, and the accused’s culpability was lesser than the accused persons in _Satesh_ and _Yap Bei Xing_. Overall the accused should be punished with a lesser custodial sentence than the accused persons in these three prior cases. The sentence of one week’s jail reached under the _Low Song Chye_ framework would not be out of line with the precedents.

## Conclusion

72     All things considered I was of the view that the appropriate sentence was one week’s imprisonment, and sentenced the accused accordingly.
