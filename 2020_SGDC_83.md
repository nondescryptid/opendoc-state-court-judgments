9 April 2020

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       David John Kidd is a 33-year-old male British citizen who worked as a fuel oil trader with a company, Lukoil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Lukoil”). He was initially alleged to have committed a total of 30 offences in connection with irregular trades that he conducted during his employment. His actions prompted the Prosecution to frame a total of 18 cheating charges under section 417 of the Penal Code (PC), and 12 falsification of accounts charges under section 477A of the PC against him.

2       After reviewing their position, on 13 March 2020, the DPPs dealing with the case informed the court that they were proceeding with only 5 charges under s 477A (“proceeded charges”), and applying for 7 similar charges to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing (“TIC charges”). These charges all involved falsifications carried out to cover losses caused to Lukoil as a result of the irregular trading that the accused had carried out, which trades had caused his employer to suffer financial losses amounting to USD768,510.

3       As for the 18 cheating charges, the DPPs informed the court that they were applying for a discharge amounting to an acquittal (DATA) for all these charges (“DATA charges”). This meant that only 12 of the initial 30 charges against the accused remained.

4       However, despite their revised position with the withdrawal of all the 18 cheating charges, the DPPs indicated that they were still sticking to their initial sentencing position that a global sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment should be imposed.

5       Before me, the accused, who is a first offender, pleaded guilty to the 5 proceeded charges and consented to the 7 TIC charges. His counsel submitted that the global sentence to be imposed should be 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

6       Both parties tendered comprehensive arguments and put forward cases that they argued justified their respective sentencing positions. Having carefully reviewed the facts of the case, the submissions of parties, and the precedents, I was of the view that an aggregate sentence of 36 weeks’ imprisonment (which also took into account the period that the accused had already spent in remand) was fair, proportionate and was appropriate for the crimes he had been convicted of. The individual and global sentences imposed are as follows:

7       In line with the Prosecution’s application, I also granted a DATA for each of the 18 cheating charges. Thereafter, at the request of the accused, I deferred the commencement of his imprisonment sentence to 23 March 2020. Neither party applied for a stay of execution of the sentence.[^1]

8       On 23 March 2020, almost 2 weeks after his plea of guilt, the accused surrendered to the State Courts to commence serving his sentence. It was on the same date that the Prosecution filed an appeal against sentence. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## (2)   The Charges and the Prescribed Punishment

9       The particulars of each falsification of accounts charge were largely similar, differing essentially only in the dates and times that the offences were committed. I have thus only reproduced the text of the 19th charge, which sets out the essential features of the charges. The 19th charge (DAC-941182-2018) reads:

> “You…. are charged that you, on 17 May 2016 at or around 11.36 a.m., at 8 Marina Boulevard #04-02 Marina Bay Financial Centre, Singapore 018981, being a servant, _to wit_, a trader employed by Lukoil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Lukoil”), did wilfully and with intent to defraud, make a false entry in an electronic record in the possession of Lukoil, _to wit_, you entered into Lukoil’s ETRM software a false mark-to-market update which created an impression that there was an unrealised gain of USD24,000 to be made from a future sale of 6000 metric tonnes of high sulphur fuel oil at a profit of USD4 per metric tonne, which fact you knew to be false, in order to conceal trading losses of USD34,440, which losses were caused by your failure to perform a corresponding hedge to the trigger order for contract number PSH16\_071239-06 on 13 May 2016, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 477A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed)..”

10     Each s 477A offence was committed to cover up losses that the accused’s irregular trading had caused to his company. A summary of the dates/times of the offences, and the details of losses covered up for the proceeded charges, is set out below.

11     The maximum punishment that may be imposed for each s 477A charge is an imprisonment term which may extend to 10 years, or with a fine, or with both.

## (3)   The Pertinent Facts

12     The Prosecution tendered a detailed 15-page Statement of Facts (SOF), which sets out the circumstances of the offences. The contents of the SOF (and an accompanying annex) were admitted to by the accused without qualification. The pertinent aspects of the SOF are reproduced below, with some details summarised:

> (1)     The complainant is Barry Allan Hamberg, a 60-year-old male Canadian. He is the managing director of Lukoil. The witness is Yeo Wei Liang Sherman, a 33-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was employed as a trading manager with Transocean Oil Pte Ltd (“Transocean”).

> (2)     On 3 February 2017 at about 11.12 a.m., the complainant lodged a police report with the Commercial Affairs Department stating that the accused had backdated trades that resulted in monetary losses for Lukoil. The place of offence was stated as Lukoil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, 8 Marina Boulevard #04-02 Marina Bay Financial Centre, Singapore 018981.

> Background facts

> (3)     In or around March 2016, Lukoil entered into a contract with Transocean for the sale and purchase of high sulphur fuel oil (“HSFO”). Under the terms of the contract, the monthly quantity of 50,000 metric tonnes of HSFO could be apportioned into separate parcels of differing quantities of HSFO to be delivered free-on-board by Lukoil on different days in the month.

> (4)     With respect to each parcel, the precise quantity and price of HSFO to be sold would be determined by way of a trigger declaration. Transocean would inform Lukoil of the quantity of HSFO it wanted to trigger (_i.e._ purchase). Lukoil would then calculate the price of the HSFO based on the average of certain mean quotations obtained from Platts Asia Pacific / Arab Gulf marketscan (“Platts”) for that pricing period after Transocean had triggered, plus a fixed premium. The price of the HSFO was therefore based on the date when the trigger was declared.

> (5)     At the material time, the accused was the sole trader responsible for and in charge of the Transocean contract. He was expected to contemporaneously enter the trade into Lukoil’s internal system known as ETRM. He knew that he had to _contemporaneously_ carry out back-to-back trades to _hedge_ the trade and cover pricing exposure resulting from the trade on the same day in order to avoid a situation where huge losses could be caused to Lukoil, since hedging helps Lukoil to mitigate its exposure to volatile oil prices. However, the accused failed to do so for all trades relating to the Transocean contract between 6 April 2016 and 29 July 2016.

> (6)     The accused also knew that when he entered the trigger dates late in the ETRM system, and only performed trades to hedge at a later date, it would create a pricing exposure to Lukoil. Between 6 April 2016 and 29 July 2016, on 19 occasions, the accused recorded the witness’s trigger declarations late in the ETRM. The delay in the recording ranged from 1 day to about 3 weeks.

> (7)     The accused had speculated on market conditions in order to improve the financial performance of the contract. He knew that if the contract performed well, he would be financially incentivised by Lukoil. The profit that he contributed as well as the book profit would be considered when Lukoil pays him his annual bonus, and he stood to benefit personally through his bonus if the prices went in his favour. The accused also admitted to the Police that he would have in all likelihood lost his job if the HSFO book continued to perform poorly.

> (8)     The accused withheld contemporaneously entering into the ETRM the trigger declaration received from Transocean. Instead, after retrieving the published price from Platts for the date triggered by Transocean, he attempted to wait for a more favourable price to hedge the trade than the one triggered by Transocean in order to gain financial advantage for his fuel oil book. However, the accused’s speculations were not favourable to Lukoil. In some instances, the accused entered the trigger declarations only when he felt that the mounting losses to Lukoil were no longer acceptable. In other instances, the accused could no longer wait for favourable market conditions as Lukoil’s operations staff would link the trade in ETRM and therefore potentially expose the irregular trade done by the accused.

> (9)     Only one trade out of 19 trades did not lead to loss. All the other 18 trades led to losses suffered by Lukoil totalling USD768,510 (SGD$1,042,012). On these 18 occasions, as a result of the late triggers at a higher price, the accused hedged at the higher price, which led to losses incurred by Lukoil. This would not have happened, if the accused had hedged the triggers contemporaneously. The accused then decided to conceal the losses incurred from Lukoil, because the losses would show up immediately in the daily Profit & Loss statement once he did the hedging at a higher price.

> Falsification via MTM updates

> (10)     Lukoil uses daily mark to market (“MTM”) updates to monitor Lukoil’s trading position and risk exposure. MTM is a method of measuring the fair value of accounts that can fluctuate over time, and aims to provide a realistic appraisal of Lukoil’s current financial situation based on current market conditions. For the MTM to provide a realistic appraisal of Lukoil’s trading position and exposure, the MTM updates have to reflect genuine trades and market prices.

> (11)     The accused entered false MTM updates into the ETRM system. These false MTM updates created an impression that certain quantities of HSFO would be bought by Lukoil and sold to a third party at a profit at a future date, when there were no such sales and purchases. This in turn created an impression that there were unrealised gains made by Lukoil, which were factored in Lukoil’s Profit & Loss statement. The net effect within the ETRM was that the losses caused by the late hedging were negated or mitigated by the false MTM updates projecting gains. As a result of the false MTM updates, the Risk Department was unable to detect the losses caused.

> (12)     The accused had hidden the losses through creating the false MTM updates, and his actions went unnoticed until Lukoil’s contract with Transocean was cancelled by the accused, and he tendered his resignation. On 28 July 2016, the Transocean contract (which was fixed up to September 2016) was cancelled prematurely by the accused without the knowledge of Lukoil’s management and he sent an email to Transocean to cancel the contract without seeking the approval of Lukoil’s management. On 29 July 2016, the accused tendered his resignation with Lukoil. These events cast suspicion on the Transocean contract and the accused’s activities in relation to the contract, which were inspected by Lukoil’s management, leading to the discovery of the offences.

> Conclusion

> (14)     Between April 2016 and July 2016, the accused performed 18 irregular trades that resulted in financial losses amounting to USD768,510 (SGD$1,042,012) to Lukoil, which the accused concealed by entering the false MTM updates. No restitution has been made by the accused to date.

> (15)     The accused was uncooperative in his interviews with the Police between March 2017 and April 2018. As a direct result of the accused’s failure to cooperate, significant investigative resources were expended between March 2017 and April 2018. The investigation officers (“IOs”) had to interview with the accused’s colleagues since the accused had falsely stated in his statements that his colleagues could have performed the irregular trades.

> (16)     Further, there were substantial evidence-gathering efforts by the IOs. For example, the IOs retrieved turnstile records from Marina Bay Financial Centre (where Lukoil’s premises are located), as well as door access records from Lukoil to connect the accused to the trades. The IP address linked to each individual trade was also obtained and traced. A detailed spreadsheet of all this information had to be constructed to link the accused to each irregular trade. The IOs also went to Lukoil’s premises several times to personally examine the ETRM system, to aid in their investigation.

> (17)     Following these investigative efforts, the accused was arrested on 15 April 2018, and remanded for 2 weeks from 16 April 2018 to 30 April 2018. Even after his arrest and while in remand, the accused initially maintained that he did not commit the offences. It was only on 28 April 2018 that the accused finally admitted to the offences.

> (18)     The accused had ample opportunity between March 2017 and April 2018 to come clean. Instead, he remained uncooperative for more than a full year, wasting precious investigative resources as a result.

## (4)   Prosecution’s submissions

13     The prosecutors, DPPs Eric Hu and Sarah Thaker, sought a global sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment consisting of the two consecutive sentences for the two charges which involved the highest amount of losses covered up i.e.:

> (1)     6 months imprisonment for 28th charge (DAC-941191-2018) – where the offence was carried out to cover up loss of USD58,020; and

> (2)     12 months imprisonment for 29th charge (DAC-941192-2018) – where the offence was carried out to cover up loss of USD413,240.

14     As for the remaining 3 proceeded charges, the Prosecution sought imprisonment sentences of 6 months per charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.

15     In support of the above proposed sentences, the DPPs tendered a set of \`Prosecution’s Submissions On Sentence’ together with a table of sentencing precedents, setting out factors that they argued supported the imposition of a 18 month’s aggregate imprisonment sentence.[^2] The DPPs emphasised the following factors:

> (1)     The significant quantum involved: The Prosecution argued that the accused had “…performed irregular trades that resulted in substantial financial losses to Lukoil amounting to S$1,042,012”, and had sought to cover up the losses by creating the false MTM updates to prevent detection. Also, no restitution was made.[^3]

> (2)     The serial nature of the offending and the number of offences: The accused had committed 12 offences over four months. 5 of the charges were proceeded with, and the remaining 7 charges of a similar nature were TIC. The offences were committed with the same _modus operandi_, and the Prosecution argued that the accused should be treated as a repeated offender.

> (3)     The steps taken to defy detection and the surreptitious planning in the commission of the offence: The Prosecution argued that “…the steps taken by the accused to conceal the losses he caused were deliberate, systematic and surreptitious”, and enabled him to avoid detection until after his resignation from the company. [^4]

> (4)     The clear breach of trust reposed in the accused and personal benefits: The Prosecution highlighted that the accused was the main bunker trader for the Transocean contract and was entrusted with the responsibility of entering the trades into the ETRM in order to hedge against the company’s pricing exposure. He had acted contrary to his responsibilities and operated a deception on the company.

> (5)     Further, while the DPPs acknowledged that the accused did not obtain a direct financial benefit from the offences, they argued that he was motivated by personal interests, and had admitted to the Police that he would have in all likelihood lost his job if he performed poorly. In any event, the Prosecution argued that the lack of personal benefit was a weak mitigating factor, and that his lack of antecedents and his plea of guilt were neutral factors in the face of the need for deterrence.

16     Finally, in support of their position that a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment should be imposed, the Prosecution referred to several cases, including:

> (1)      _Tan Puay Boon v Public Prosecuto_r <span class="citation">\[2003\] 3 SLR 390</span> (“_Tan Puay Boon_”): This was a case which involved an offender who had diverted over $40,000 from her company to herself or her family members over the span of 5 years. The offender was convicted after a trial on 8 charges under section 477A. Her aggregate sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment was affirmed on appeal.

> (2)      _Sabastian s/o Anthony Samy v Public Prosecutor (“Sabastian Anthony”)_ MA No. 343/1985/01(unreported)[^5]: The offender had actively concealed and falsified documents to cover up losses of over S$2.7 million caused by unauthorised fund transfers. He pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to two concurrent 3-year imprisonment sentences. The sentences were upheld on appeal.

> (3)      _Chew Soo Chun v Public Prosecutor_ [^6] _(“Chew Soo Chun”):_ The offender here was the CEO of a company. He had artificially boosted the sales revenue records by recording fictitious transactions in its accounts such that between 2005 to 2006, the sales revenue and gross profits for each financial period was overstated by 32% to 65%. The falsifications were committed with the intention of creating a false impression of strong revenue and performance. In June 2006, the offender applied for trade financing loans from OCBC using fictitious documents to support the false transactions recorded on the company’s accounts. The offender pleaded guilty to 5 proceeded charges under section 477A, and was sentenced to 12-18 months’ imprisonment per section 477A charge, for sums ranging from $20,000 (lowest) to $298,050 (highest). The sentences were upheld on appeal.

> (4)      _Public Prosecutor v Gene Chong Soon Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 117</span> _(“Gene Chong Soon Hui”):_ The offender was the finance manager of a company, Ad Planet Group. He created fictitious transactions for payments that were purportedly due from the company to its suppliers. He then obtained pre-signed company cheques on which he entered his own name and bank account details. The offender then enchased the cheques and pocketed the receipts, which he then recorded as payments made to various suppliers. Thereafter, the offender falsely altered the sales revenue records of the company so as to justify its artificially increased production costs. He also raised fake invoices to create the impression that monies were owed to the company, and issued credit notes to write-off these unpaid debts owed to the company. For his acts, he faced a total of 194 charges: 165 of the charges were for cheating offences under section 420 of the PC, and the remaining 29 charges were for falsification offences under section 477A of the PC. The overall amount of losses caused by the accused across all the cheating charges was S$3,193,737.65, and the total amount involved for all the falsification charges was approximately $863,000. The district court sentenced the offender to 33 months’ imprisonment for each proceeded cheating charge, and 8 months’ imprisonment for each falsification charge. Four of the sentences for the cheating charges were ordered to run consecutively for a total sentence of 132 months’ imprisonment. The sentences imposed for the s 477A charges were subsumed within the global sentence.

17     Based on the above cases, the Prosecution argued that a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for the five s 477A charges in the present case, as suggested in their table, as reproduced below:[^7]

18     In addition to the four cases cited above, which the Prosecution discussed at some length in their sentencing submissions, the Prosecution also attached a table that included seven other cases. Of these seven cases, two of them involved offenders who, like in the present case, were dealt with solely for s 477A offences, and where the falsification of accounts were also carried out to conceal trading and business losses that had already been incurred. I will discuss these cases further when explaining my decision on sentence.[^8]

## (5)   Mitigation Plea

19     The lead Defence Counsel, Mr Abraham Vergis, sought a sentence of 6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with the sentences for two of the charges to run consecutively for a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

20     Mr Vergis argued that his proposed sentences were based on the sentences imposed in the District Court decision of _PP v Lim Lee Eng Jansen_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] SGDC 188</span> (“_Jansen Lim_”), where District Judge (DJ) See Kee Oon (as he then was) had similarly imposed 6 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with two of these sentences to run consecutively for a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment. Mr Vergis submitted that there were similarities in the present case with _Jansen Lim_, and that, in fact, the circumstances in _Jansen Lim_ were even more aggravating.[^9]

21     Counsel also highlighted the following sentencing factors which he argued operated in favour of the accused:[^10]

> (1)     The accused did not have any intention to cause loss to the Lukoil, but had intended to help the company make a profit “…on what would otherwise have been loss-making back-to-back trades”.

> (2)     There was no pecuniary gain to the accused, since there was no direct co-relation of his salary and bonus with his individual financial performance. Further, as the accused was headhunted by another firm around the time of his offences, he would not have benefitted from the offences as he would not receive any year-end bonus.

> (3)     The extent of the company’s losses was circumscribed by the fact that it was limited to a small number of transactions, involving only one customer and over a short period. The loss was also relatively low, given the size of the company’s overall total trades (which was valued at about S$2.4 billion annually).

> (4)     The accused was a low-level trading assistant, whose wrongful actions were limited, straightforward, unsophisticated and easily detectable.

> (5)     The accused is a young man and a first offender who has pleaded guilty. He also only has a low likelihood of re-offending.

22     Further, in arguing for a global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment, counsel pointed out that based on the precedents, there was no clear link between the loss occasioned by the various offenders, and the overall sentence imposed in those cases. This was shown by the cases cited by the Prosecution as well as from the cases set out in a table put up by the Defence, which I have reproduced below[^11]:

23     Counsel also sought to distinguish the four main cases put forward by the Prosecution in their written submissions, arguing that save for the case of _Sabastian Anthony_, the offenders in the other three cases committed the offences for personal gain. In addition, counsel argued that the facts in the Prosecution’s cited cases were more aggravating than the circumstances of the present case, as all the precedents involved larger number of charges (over a hundred proceeded and TIC charges for each case), the offences that were more sophisticated and elaborate, and they were committed over longer periods of time as compared to the present case. Finally, the offenders in those cases were all in a greater position of trust vis a vis their companies, and also held significantly higher positions.[^12]

## (6)   Decision on Sentence

24     I begin my analysis by stating that I agree with the Prosecution that in deciding on the sentence for s 477A charges, the starting point must be to consider the factors identified by former Chief Justice Yong Pung How in _Tan Puay Boon._ These factors, discussed at \[47\]- \[51\] of the judgment, are as follows:

> (1)     Whether there was deviousness or surreptitious planning in the commission of the offence;

> (2)     Whether the falsifications were committed for one’s personal gain;

> (3)     Whether there was an abuse of trust; and

> (4)     The amount involved in the falsifications.

25     In this regard, I also note, from the contents of the ‘Plea in Mitigation’, that the Defence was also broadly in agreement that the above factors (together with some other considerations that the Defence highlighted) were relevant for sentencing.

26     Nevertheless, despite apparent broad agreement on the relevant sentencing factors, the Prosecution and Defence were poles apart in the sentences that they proposed- both the sentences for the individual charges as well as the global sentence. In this regard, it was obvious that, quite aside from disagreements between parties over the presence, relevance and effect of the various sentencing factors above, the differences in their proposed sentences also stemmed from the precedent cases that the parties chose to emphasise.

### (a)   The factors in Tan Puay Boon and evaluating the cases cited by the Prosecution

27     As regards the factors identified in _Tan Puay Boon_, my views as to their applicability to the present case are as follows:

> (1)      Extent and manner of planning involved in the commission of the offence:

>> (i)       In the present case, the crux of each s 477A offence, as clearly set out in each charge, was that the accused had made the false MTM updates in the ETRM system on 12 separate occasions in order to cover up losses that had arisen because of his 18 irregular trades. His actions circumvented measures put in place by the company to detect losses, and essentially followed the same _modus operandi_. To that extent, the actions of the accused could be said to be recurring and premeditated.

>> (ii)       However, I agreed with the Defence that there was nothing put forward to show that the entering of the false MTM updates into the ETRM system, was preceded by the same type of elaborate planning or deliberation, or that the offences were as sophisticated, surreptitious or egregious as the facts in the main cases cited by the Prosecution. Put simply, in the cases relied on by the Prosecution, there was clearly far more detailed and deliberate planning, and also greater culpability displayed by the offenders in those cases.

>>> (A)       In _Tan Puay Boon_, the offender had used fictitious names, varied entries in the company’s books, manipulated income tax forms, forged her Managing Director’s signature, used false payment vouchers and salary rolls, initiated change of auditors and extensively exploited a dormant creditor’s account.

>>> (B)       In _Chew Soo Chun_, there was systematic “cooking of the books” to artificially boast the company’s sales revenue which resulted in a total of 5 proceeded charges under s 477A PC, and another 108 TIC charges under s 477A PC.[^13] As pointed out by the Defence, in _Chew Soo Chun_, “(o)ver the period of 2 years, the accused embarked on a scheme to artificially boost the sales revenue records of the company by recording fictitious transactions in its accounts. He then used these fictitious documents to obtain trade financing loans amounting to around $2.6 million from OCBC. The entire scheme was described by the court as being an “_elaborate web of fictitious trade documents and forged accounting documents_”.”[^14]

>>> (C)       In _Gene Chong Soon Hui_, the offender had committed cheating against his company, through the creation of various fictitious transactions for which payments were ostensibly due. To avoid detection, he falsely altered the sales revenue records of the company and raised fake invoices to create the impression that monies were owed to the company. He also issued credit notes to write-off the unpaid debts owed to the company. For his acts, the Prosecution framed a total of 194 charges against him, consisting of 165 cheating charges under s 420, and 29 charges for offences under s 477A.[^15]

>> (iii)       Clearly, the scale and extent of the offenders’ planning and execution of their crimes in the above cases, went far beyond what the accused had done in the present case.

> (2)      Whether the falsifications were committed for one’s personal gain:

>> (i)       As regards this second consideration highlighted in _Tan Puay Boon_, the position set out in the accused’s SOF was that he had speculated on market conditions in order to improve the financial performance of the contract, that he knew that he would be financially incentivised by his company if the contract did well, and also that his annual bonus may be influenced by the profit he contributed to the book profit (see \[15\] of the SOF). Further, the accused was apparently concerned about losing his job as he had admitted to the police that he would have in all likelihood have lost his job if the HSFO book continued to perform poorly. Thereafter, to avoid detection when the trades did not go the way he had hoped, the accused ended up committing the offences of falsifying the MTM updates to cover up the resulting losses.

>> (ii)       However, as pointed out by the Defence, the accused did not receive any actual monetary benefits from his misdeeds, something which the Prosecution, quite fairly, conceded to be the position in the present case.

>> (iii)       This lack of monetary benefit thus contrasted strongly from the three main cases relied on by the Prosecution, namely the cases of _Gene Chong Soon Hui, Chew Soo Chun_ and _Tan Puay Boon_, where the offenders had all derived significant gains from their criminal offences.[^16]

> (3)      Whether there was an abuse of trust:

>> (i)       The accused was described as the main trader in charge of the Transocean contract. To the extent that was made clear in the SOF, he was entrusted with responsibility over the account, and was able to carry out his irregular trades. He was also able to come up with fake MTM updates on a total of 12 occasions over the course of four months, and was apparently able to do so largely (or completely) unchecked. Thus, it was clear that for at least the period of the offences when he was in the employ of the company, the accused was entrusted with apparently full or overriding responsibility over this contract by his company. It was this trust that the accused had abused, not only in carrying out irregular trades (which arguably was a breach of his duty to his company), but also in subsequently committing the illegal acts to cover up his actions.

>> (ii)       That said, and to be fair to the accused, while he was a trader in charge of this particular account, as far as the precedents relied on by the Prosecution was concerned, I accepted the Defence’s argument that the accused here certainly did not appear in as high a position in the company’s hierarchy, nor was he as long in his employment with his company, as the offenders in the cases relied on by the Prosecution. Specifically, as pointed out by the Defence, I noted the following distinctions between the present case and the facts in three of the main cases relied on by the Prosecution. [^17]

>>> (A)       In _Tan Puay Boon_: The offender “…was not just a finance executive but had been in the company for such a long time (16 years) that she was invited to be a shareholder and director of a related company. In comparison, \[the accused in the present case\] was only a junior trader with 2 years’ experience.”

>>> (B)       In _Gene Chong Soon Hui:_ The offender was the finance manager and was able to carry out his 194 offences over 8 years without detection.

>>> (C)       In _Chew Soo Chun:_ The offender was the CEO and managing director of the company that was victimised by his offences.

> (4)      The amount involved in the falsifications:

>> (i)       I recognised that the offences in the present case (the creation of the fake MTM updates to conceal losses) was not the direct cause of the losses to the company. Instead, they were carried out to conceal losses that had been earlier caused by the accused due to his earlier irregular trades. However, I could not ignore the connection between the quantum of the losses that the company suffered, and the actions of the accused in concealing each loss through his false MTM update, as the concealment essentially allowed the irregular trades to continue. Ultimately, the irregular trades that were carried out over 4 months, though not in themselves offences, caused the company to suffer losses totalling USD768,510 (SGD1,042,012).

>> (ii)       That said, while the losses from the accused’s irregular trades were significant, they had to be compared against the losses suffered in the other cases cited by parties. This factor was perhaps most significant when one looks not just at the main cases emphasised in the Prosecution’s written submissions, where the factual matrix were significantly dissimilar from the present case, but perhaps more so when one considers the other set of irregular trading cases referred to by both the Prosecution[^18] and the Defence[^19], namely the “Mitsui Oil” cases.[^20]

>> (iii)       In essence, the Mitsui Oil cases concerned three accused persons who were involved in oil trading and who had broadly been involved in entering false prices into the daily mark-to-market profit and loss reports to conceal trading losses from the head office, Mitsui Tokyo. As highlighted by the Defence, the losses caused to Mitsui Oil by each of these offenders “was colossal”, and ranged from more than USD30 million to USD81 million. For those offenders, the final global sentences imposed were 20 weeks’ imprisonment (in _Takayoshi Wada),[^21]_ 18 months’ imprisonment (in _Takahashi Masatsugu),[^22]_ and 24 months’ imprisonment (in _Noriyuki Yamazaki).[^23]_ Thus, as compared to the losses involved in those cases, the total loss caused by the accused in the present case was clearly significantly less. I will discuss the Mitsui Oil cases in greater detail at a later part of this judgement.

28     For completeness, aside from the four _Tan Puay Boon_ factors discussed above, I also note that the three main cases (_Gene Chong Soon Hui, Chew Soo Chun_ and _Tan Puay Boon)_ relied on by the Prosecution, all involved offenders who faced many more charges than the 12 charges that the accused ultimately faced in the present case. Specifically:

> (1)     In _Gene Chong Soon Hui_, the offender had a total of 194 charges, consisting of 165 cheating charges under s 420, and 29 falsification charges under s 477A;

> (2)     In _Chew Soo Chun_, the offender had 5 falsification charges under s 477A PC proceeded with, and another 108 TIC charges; and

> (3)     In _Tan Puay Boon_ the offender was convicted of 8 charges under s 477A PC that were proceeded with. Another 109 charges were not tried.

29     Further, in the sentencing table put up by the Prosecution, aside from the main cases discussed above, many of the other cases similarly involved offenders who faced many more charges, as well as different types of other offences (other than s 477A offences), and some of them also involved significantly more aggravated facts as compared to the facts in the present case. In this regard, the accused in the present case ultimately faced only 12 charges under s 477A, of which only 5 charges were proceeded with. I thus did not find these other cited cases to be helpful in deciding on the punishment to impose in the present case.

30     In addition, I note that the DPPs had chosen to withdraw the 18 cheating charges that the Prosecution had initially framed against the accused in the present case. The accused was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal on each of the 18 cheating charges. The Prosecution may have embarked on this course of action because, while the accused’s false MTM updates to hide the irregular trading losses were admittedly offences, the 18 irregular trades by themselves may not have amounted to offences at all, even if they were actually the direct cause of the financial losses (amounting to USD768,510) to the company. This consideration, was yet another major point of difference between the present case and many of the cases cited by the Prosecution. In this regard, the Prosecution’s decision to proceed only with s 477A charges was not entirely surprising, since this was apparently also the approach taken in the Mitsui Oil cases, where it was also only s 477A charges that were framed against the offenders for the actions they took to cover up business/trading losses that had occurred.

31     For completeness, I would add that another point to note about the present case was that the accused had pleaded guilty, unlike the offender in cases such as _Tan Puay Boon_.

32     Thus, in light of the significant differences between the cases relied on by the Prosecution in their submissions seeking a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment, and the facts of the present case, I did not find the sentences imposed in those cases, to be directly useful in deciding on the appropriate sentence to impose in the present case. This, of course, does not mean that I disregarded the similar considerations in those cases that clearly also applied to the present case, albeit to different degrees.

33     For completeness, I note that the Prosecution had submitted that the sentence imposed in _Sebastian Anthony_ also supported their contention that a 18-month imprisonment term should be imposed in the present case. However, with respect, I do not agree.

> (1)     For one, it should be noted that _Sebastian Anthony_ was a rather dated decision, being a 1985 appeal. Further, unlike many of the other cases put forward by the Prosecution (as well as by the Defence), _Sebastian Anthony_ was not a reported decision, although it was discussed in _Tan Puay Boon_ and in _Noriyuki Yamazaki_. However, without knowing the actual reasoning of the courts in _Sebastian Anthony_, this somewhat limited the precedent value of the case since it was not entirely clear how the sentence was arrived at. In this respect, I would reiterate the caution expressed by Chan Sek Keong CJ (as he then was) in _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 707</span> at \[21\] against indiscriminately relying on unreported decisions.

> (2)     Nevertheless, so far as could be gleaned about the facts of _Sabastian Anthony_ (as set out in the two cases that commented on it), the offender there had actively concealed and falsified documents to cover up losses of over S$2.7 million that were caused by unauthorised fund transfers. Clearly, his offences were premediated and likely more extensive, and they also involved his working with an accomplice.

> (3)     Further, I note that in _Sabastian Anthony_, the offender faced a total of 142 charges under s 477A, with the offences committed over a relatively longer period of twelve months.

34     In light of the above considerations in _Sabastian Anthony_, and the differences between that case and the present case, I did not consider _Sabastian Anthony_ to be particularly useful as far as helping to determine the sentence to impose in the present case.

35     All in all, with respect, I did not find the sentences imposed in many of the precedent cases emphasised by the Prosecution, to necessarily provide good guidance as to the appropriate sentence for the present case. Put simply, the facts were too different, and the circumstances in those cases were generally more aggravated, than what existed here.

36     Nevertheless, while I was of the view that the sentences set out in those cases discussed were not necessarily helpful guides, there were two cases that were included in the Prosecution’s sentencing table that I considered to be a lot more helpful in deciding on the appropriate sentence in the present case. These two cases, _Noriyuki Yamazaki_, and _Takahashi Masatsugu_ (both referred to in \[27(4)(iii)\] above), were part of the Mitsui Oil set of cases, all of which shared many similarities with the present case. Incidentally, these were also the cases, together with the third Mitsui Oil case of _Takayoshi Wada_, that the Defence urged me to consider in sentencing. It is to these cases that I now turn my focus.

### (b)   The Mitsui Oil cases

37     Similar to the present case, the Mitsui Oil cases all involved first offenders who had pleaded guilty to s 477A charges tendered against them. The offenders also consented to having similar s 477A charges taken into consideration in sentencing. Their s 477A PC offences were likewise committed to cover up trading or business losses, and those losses, like in the present case, were apparently not themselves the result of criminal acts of the offenders. I now move on to consider the specific facts of each Mitsui Oil case.

> (1)     In _Noriyuki Yamazaki_, the offender pleaded guilty on 6 April 2009 to 10 charges under s 477A PC, with another 99 similar charges taken into consideration. The offender was the main naphtha trader in Mitsui Oil Asia (MOA) and had entered false data and provided false naphtha swaps prices to MOA middle office staff, by entering false data into an Excel spreadsheet. The false entries were used by the MOA middle office staff to prepare the Daily Mark-To-Market Report. The offender there committed the offences in order to conceal the naphtha trading losses from Mitsui Tokyo. The amount of losses concealed in each of the 10 proceeded charges ranged from about USD5 million to about USD12.9 million. The total losses caused to the company, which could not be ascertained with certainty, ranged from USD71 million to USD81 million. The offender was originally sentenced to a global sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment (1 year’s imprisonment per charge with five sentences running consecutively), with the District Judge relying heavily on the sentence imposed in _Sabastian Anthony_ in arriving at the aggregate sentence. However, on appeal to the High Court, the global sentence was reduced from 5 years’ imprisonment to 2 years’ imprisonment, although no written judgement was issued by the High Court.

> (2)     In _Takahashi Masatsugu_, the offender pleaded guilty on 6 August 2009 to 20 charges under s 477A, with another 110 similar charges taken into consideration. He was the Executive Vice President of MOA and had falsified MOA’s accounts by giving instructions to MOA’s middle office staff to reduce the naphtha Mark-To-Market profit and loss figures in the Daily Position Reports. He committed the offences so that he need not have to submit daily reports to Mitsui Tokyo explaining the fluctuations in the profit and loss. The losses that were under reported in respect of the 20 proceeded charges amounted to USD73.6 million. The offender was originally sentenced to a global sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment (9 months’ imprisonment per charge with four sentences running consecutively). On appeal, the High Court reduced the global sentence to 18 months’ imprisonment (with only two sentences of 9 months’ imprisonment running consecutively). Unfortunately, there was again no written judgment issued to explain the High Court’s halving of the aggregate sentence.

> (3)     Finally, in _Takayoshi Wada_, the offender who was the general manager of trading, pleaded guilty in May 2009 to 3 charges of conspiring with his subordinate, Noriyuki Yamazaki, in the commission of the falsification offences. He had another 14 similar charges taken into consideration, and was sentenced to 20 weeks’ imprisonment in total. The losses that were concealed in respect of the 3 proceeded charges amounted to about USD33 million. While the sentence imposed by the court there appeared to be lenient, it was clear from the judgment that there were strong mitigating factors present. These factors included the fact the offender had not caused nor intended to cause the loss but the loss had actually been caused by the principal offender, Yamazaki (\[39\] of the judgement), that the offender did not stand to receive any benefit (\[45\] of the judgement), and that the offender co-operated with authorities and even offered to be a prosecution witness (\[48\] of the judgement). It should also be noted that the period of his offences was about a month (\[44\] of the judgement).

38     The sentences in the Mitsui Oil cases are summarised below:

39     Based on the Mitsui Oil cases, in particular the case of _Takahashi Masatsugu_, it could be seen that even where the offender was an Executive Vice President of the company, and the falsification involved losses amounting to USD73.6 million, the global sentence imposed by the appellate court was only 18 months’ imprisonment. This was the same sentence the Prosecution was seeking in the present case against the accused, a trader, who was trying to conceal losses of slightly more than 1% (i.e. USD 768,510) of the amount involved in _Takahashi Masatsugu_.

40     In addition, when one considers the global sentence imposed on _Noriyuki Yamazaki_ (the main trader who concealed losses between USD71-USD81 million and who was ultimately sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment), and the global sentence imposed on _Takayoshi Wada_ (the general manager of trading who concealed losses exceeding USD33 million and who was sentenced to 20 weeks’ imprisonment), it was difficult to justify why the accused in the present case should be sentenced to a global sentence of 18 month’s imprisonment, as proposed by the Prosecution_._

41     Of course, I note that there were limitations in trying to directly apply the sentences imposed in the Mitsui cases to the present case:

> (1)     For one, those cases were decided when the maximum prescribed punishment for a s 477A offence was only 7 years’ imprisonment, and the maximum prescribed punishment has since been increased to 10 years’ imprisonment.

> (2)     In addition, for _Takahashi Masatsugu_, and _Noriyuki Yamazaki_, while the appellate court reduced the aggregate sentences to 18 months’ (from 36 months’) imprisonment, and 2 years’ (from 5 years’) imprisonment respectively, the lack of written judgements in those cases to explain the appellate courts’ decisions, also meant that it was not clear what aspects of the lower courts’ reasoning they endorsed or rejected, and generally how they arrived at the aggregate sentences finally imposed.

> (3)     Further, in _Takayoshi Wada_, there were clearly strong mitigating factors present there that did not necessarily apply to the accused in the present case.

42     Nonetheless, taking into account the similarities and differences between the individual Mitsui Oil cases with the present case, I was of the view that the aggregate sentence to impose in the present case should be higher than the 20 weeks’ imprisonment imposed in _Takayoshi Wada_, but significantly lower than the 18 months’ imprisonment imposed by the High Court in _Takahashi Masatsugu_, and the 2 years’ imprisonment imposed by the High Court in _Noriyuki Yamazaki ._

### (c)   Jansen Lim and determining the final sentence

43     I turn now to consider the main case relied on by the Defence i.e. the case of _Jansen Lim_. For this case, I note that:

> (1)     The offender had pleaded guilty to 4 charges under section 477A, and there were another 21 similar TIC charges. The offender was a senior bank manager who had extended additional credit to a bank client when he should not have done so. He had thereafter instructed his subordinates to suppress or delay data entry for the additional credit extended so that an excess report would not be generated and thus the bank would be unaware of the additional credit that had been granted. From the 25 letters of credit so suppressed, which formed the subject-matter of his charges, a total of USD11.455 million was made available to the client. The bank faced unauthorised risk exposure, and eventually suffered a total loss of USD5 million. 

> (2)     From the written judgment of the case, it should also be noted that in deciding on sentence, the court had considered the offender’s remorse and the fact that he had fully co-operated with the authorities (see \[57\]). Further, in deciding on the sentence, the court also noted the offender’s character references, which “spoke highly of him as a decent individual and a dedicated professional”, and the court concluded that “…it was highly unlikely that the offences would be repeated.” (see \[23\])

> (3)     I further observed that in _Jansen Lim_, after considering the various sentencing factors, the court had, before coming up with the final aggregate sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment, considered the application of the totality principle. Therafter, in explaining how it arrived at the 12 weeks’ imprisonment term, the court stated that this sentence had taken into account the fact that the offender had already been remanded for 2 months. Thus, by effectively imposing what was an ‘additional’ incarceration term of 12 weeks, the court recognised that the total period that the offender would actually be incarcerated for would add up to 4 months, which in the words of the judge “…is the same period of incarceration that he might have faced if he had been sentenced to an aggregate imprisonment sentence of 6 months” (see \[61\]).

> (4)     It was thus clear that the court in _Jansan Lim_ had decided on this global sentence of 12 weeks’ imprisonment, in such a way that the offender actually got to serve the same custodial term (i.e. 4 months) that he would have, if the court had simply imposed a global sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment at the onset, and there had been no remand period of 2 months to consider. Thus, but for the fact that the offender had already served a 2 month period of remand, the court would apparently have imposed a global sentence of 6 months imprisonment based on the facts of the case. Indeed, both the Prosecution[^24] and the Defence[^25] accepted that this was the approach of the court in _Jansen Lim_.

44     As could be seen from the discussion of _Jansen Lim_, the facts of that case were clearly more benign, and the mitigating factors were undoubtedly more compelling, than those in the present case. Indeed, in the subsequent case of _Tan Puay Boon_, Yong Pung How CJ had, when commenting on the sentence imposed in _Jansen Lim_, noted at \[48\] of the judgement that the relatively short custodial sentence imposed in _Jansen Lim_ was because the offences were unsophisticated and unsurreptitious, with the main intention of conferring benefit on a bank customer.

45     Further, I would point out that unlike the situation in _Jansen Lim_, where the offender had rendered full co-operation to the authorities (see \[59\]), the accused in the present case was noted to have been uncooperative in police interviews, and considerable time and investigative resources had to be expended before he finally admitted to the offences (see \[55\] of the SOF). Further, the accused here had even falsely stated in his statements to the police that it was his colleagues who could have performed the irregular trades.

46     Thus, as regards _Jansen Lim_, just as with the main cases cited by the Prosecution in the written submissions where the facts were dissimilar in significant ways from the present case, I was also of the view that the facts in _Jansen Lim_ were sufficiently different, such that neither the 12 weeks’ imprisonment sentence ultimately imposed in _Jansen Lim_, nor even a sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment that may otherwise have been imposed, would be an appropriate sentence for the accused in the present case.

## (7)   Conclusion

47     Nevertheless, in so far as the case of _Jansen Lim_ could serve as a reference point, it was to show that the global sentence that should be imposed in the present case should be more than even the 6 months’ imprisonment sentence that may otherwise have been imposed in _Jansen Lim_.

48     Further, I also note that in _Jansen Lim_, as with the Mitsui Oil cases, the maximum prescribed imprisonment term for a s 477A offence that applied was 7 years’ imprisonment. The upper limit has now been increased to 10 years’ imprisonment, which was slightly less than one and a half times the maximum that applied in _Jansen Lim_. This change to the sentencing limit was also something that I had to consider, since the Court of Appeal in _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 653</span> had made it clear at \[84\] of the judgement that: “…sentencing judges must take note of the maximum penalty and then apply their minds to determine precisely where the offender’s conduct falls within the spectrum of punishment devised by Parliament.”

49     In light of the above considerations, in particular, the clearly more aggravating circumstances in the present case as compared to the circumstances in _Jansen Lim_, I was of the view that the global imprisonment sentence that should be imposed on the accused should be closer to 39 - 40 weeks’ imprisonment. This is more than one and a half times the sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment that would have been appropriate in _Jansen Lim._ Further, such a sentence was more in line with the sentences imposed in the Mitsui Oil cases (see \[42\] above), and was also in accord with the two limbs of the totality principle, namely that the aggregate sentence imposed should:[^26]

> (1)     Not be “substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed”; and

> (2)     Not be “crushing” in a way that was out of keeping with his record and prospects.

50     Further, in finalising the aggregate sentence to be imposed, I also considered the period that the accused had already spent in remand. In this regard, I was gratified to note that the DPPs had quite fairly indicated that the Prosecution has no objection for the period of remand to be taken into consideration when deciding on the final sentence. [^27]

51     In addition, in deciding on exactly how the period of remand should be accounted for, I note that the court in _Jansen Lim_ had also taken into consideration the effect of remission on the sentence to be imposed. Specifically, at \[61\], the court had stated:

> “Having regard to the totality principle in sentencing, I took into account the two months that he had spent in remand. All in all, he would be incarcerated for about four months’ after remission has been considered. That is the same period of incarceration he might have faced if he had been sentenced to an aggregate term of six months’ imprisonment.”

52     Using the same approach as that adopted in _Jansen Lim_, it would appear that the effect of the 2 weeks spent by the accused in remand in the present case, could be taken to be equivalent to his having undergone 3 weeks of imprisonment (after factoring in remission).[^28] This means that if an aggregate sentence of 39 weeks’ imprisonment would otherwise have been an appropriate sentence, I should be imposing an aggregate sentence of 36 weeks’ imprisonment at this stage, since the accused would then actually be incarcerated for about 26 weeks after remission has been considered. This is essentially the same period of incarceration that he would have faced if he had been sentenced to an aggregate term of 39 weeks’ imprisonment to begin with (see \[51\] above).

53     As for the specific sentence to impose for each charge, I accepted the submission of the Prosecution that the sentence imposed for DAC 941192-2018 (where the loss covered up was much higher) should be double that of the sentences imposed for the other charges, and that the global sentence should consist of two consecutive sentences for the charges which involved the highest amount of losses covered up. Further, I note that this approach – of having two sentences run consecutively – would also be consistent with the decisions of the appellate courts in the Mitsui Oil cases of _Takahashi Masatsugu_, and _Noriyuki Yamazaki_, where both courts ordered only 2 imprisonment sentences to run consecutively.

54     All in all, in light of the above considerations, I imposed the following consecutive sentences, for a global sentence of 36 weeks’ imprisonment:

> (1)     24 weeks’ imprisonment for 29th charge (DAC-941192-2018) to cover up loss of USD413,240, and

> (2)     12 weeks’ imprisonment for 28th charge (DAC-941191-2018) to cover up loss of USD58,020; and

55     As for the remaining 3 proceeded charges, I imposed 12 weeks’ imprisonment per charge with the sentences to run concurrently.

56     In summary, I am of the view that an aggregate sentence of 36 weeks’ imprisonment imposed in the present case for an accused who has already served 2 weeks of remand, and who was convicted of 5 charges (with 7 TIC charges) of covering up losses of USD768,510, is fair and proportionate. This is especially so when compared against the facts and sentences in the various cases cited by the parties, including cases such as _Jansen Lim_ (12 weeks’ imprisonment[^29] where amount involved exceeded USD11 million), and the Mitsui Oil cases (imprisonment between 20 weeks’ to 2 years’ imprisonment where the amounts involved ranged from over USD30 million to USD94.3 million).

57     It leaves me to thank both parties for their detailed and forceful submissions, and for bringing to my attention precedents that were useful in coming up with an aggregate sentence which I am of the view fits the crime. I would conclude this grounds of decision by echoing what was said in _Jansen Lim._ At \[62\] of the judgment, the learned judge had stated: “I have sought to achieve a rational balance between the need to uphold a deterrent and, to some extent, a retributive element as well in sentencing the accused, and the concern that the punishment should be commensurate with his degree of culpability”.

58     The aggregate sentence of 36 weeks’ imprisonment imposed on the accused, is a result of a similar attempt applied to the present case.
