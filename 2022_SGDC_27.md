The total sentence is a global fine of $53,300 in default 181 days' imprisonment. The accused has paid the fine in full.

6       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision has filed an appeal against his conviction on 22 November 2021.

7       I now set out the grounds of my decision on conviction only.

## The Law

### Corrupt transactions with agents

8       The present case involves 30 charges of the accused corruptly giving gratification to an agent under s 6(_b_) of the PCA. S 6 of the PCA reads as follows:

> 6.    If —

>> (a)    any agent corruptly accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain, from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business;

>> (b)    any person corruptly gives or agrees to give or offers any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to do any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s affairs or business; or

>> (c)    any person knowingly gives to an agent, or if an agent knowingly uses with intent to deceive his principal, any receipt, account or other document in respect of which the principal is interested, and which contains any statement which is false or erroneous or defective in any material particular, and which to his knowledge is intended to mislead the principal,

> he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.

### Elements of the offence

9       To prove its case against the accused, the Prosecution must establish beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the charges namely:

> (a)     The giving, the agreeing to give or the offering of gratification to an agent (“first element”);

> (b)     This gratification was an inducement or reward for helping the giver, namely the accused (“second element”);

> (c)     There was an objective corrupt element in the transaction (third element”);

> (d)     The accused gave the gratification to the agent with guilty knowledge (“fourth element”).

10     The first element is the _actus reus_ of the offence while the other three elements pertain to the _mens rea_ of the accused. The second element of the offence is normally part of the same factual enquiry as the third (see _PP v Leng Kah Poh_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1264</span> at \[20\] and \[22\](“_Leng Kah Poh_”). The third element of whether a transaction has a corrupt element is an objective inquiry that is essentially based on the ordinary standard of the reasonable man and the question is to be answered only after the court has found or inferred what the accused intended when he entered into the transaction.

11     In determining corrupt intent, the High Court in _PP v Low Tiong Choon_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 119</span> held at \[30\] that:

> It is of course an evidential exercise, sometimes a difficult one, when the court has to infer the accused’s intention behind the transaction – what was the accused’s intention or reason for giving or receiving the gratification? In this respect, the surrounding circumstances of the case will no doubt assist the judge in inferring what this intention or ulterior motive (if any) is. Hence, surreptitiousness or furtiveness of the transaction, the size of the gratification, relationship of the parties, breaking of rules or code may, as far as relevant, form part of that surrounding circumstances which, together with all the other evidence, will point towards the proper intention to be inferred.

12     In _Chan Wing Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 1 SLR(R) 721</span> (“_Chan Wing Seng_”) at \[23\], the High Court held that the fourth element of guilty knowledge refers to whether the accused knew or realised that what he did was corrupt by the ordinary and objective standard and is a subjective test.

## Undisputed facts

13     The accused is a director of OHPL, a food distribution company which imported and supplied various gourmet food items to restaurants, including truffle oil. In 2014, OHPL was a small company and as the accused was fairly new to the industry, he had struggled to secure customers. He ran a lean business, handling all aspects of the business himself including sourcing for food products, marketing, sourcing for customers, doing deliveries, and accounting.

14     In August 2014, as the accused handled all aspects of OHPL’ business alone, he was looking for customers near where he lived at Farrer Road to facilitate deliveries. He visited the Omakase restaurant located at ‘The Grandstand’ in person to see if it would be interested in his company’s products.

#### The principal

15     Omakase Burger Pte Ltd is a company in the business of running restaurants and had operated three restaurants at its peak. The restaurant at The Grandstand located at 200 Turf Club Road opened in October 2012 and ceased operations in March 2018. The restaurant at level 1 of Wisma Atria located at 435 Orchard Road opened in April 2014 and closed in April 2017. The third restaurant was located at ‘Picnic’ at level 3 of Wisma Atria, opened in November 2016 and was still in operation during the trial.

#### The agent

16     Mr Hoe Kim Tick (PW2), the head chef at Omakase was responsible for managing kitchen inventory and managing supplies at the Omakase restaurant at The Grandstand.

17     Sometime in late 2014, the accused met and became acquainted with PW2 at the Omakase restaurant at The Grandstand. The accused had discussions with PW2 about the type, price, and quantity of truffle oil used by Omakase. Upon learning that Omakase used significant quantities of truffle oil to prepare their food, the accused endeavoured to become Omakase’s truffle oil supplier. The supply of truffle oil to Omakase was an appealing prospect for OHPL which was a small company at the time since truffle oil was the most profitable item in the company’s inventory in terms of profit margin.

18     PW2 was an agent at the time the cash payments were made to him. When PW2 was working at The Grandstand, the payments were made at the smoking area at Turf City. After PW2 moved to the Omakase outlet at Wisma Atria, the payments were made to him at the smoking area at Wisma Atria.

#### Cash payments and valuable gifts

19     The accused testified that between June 2015 to February 2017, he made monthly cash payments of $300 to PW2. The accused also gave PW2 a bottle of Martell Cognac, a Masamoto knife, a Louis Vuitton belt, a Bottega Venetta wallet and the two red packets containing $188 and $80 between April 2015 to February 2017. The accused did not give the other chefs at Omakase any similar gifts of money as what he had given to PW2.

#### PW2 dealt with as a receiver

20     On 14 June 2018, PW2 pleaded guilty to ten charges under s 6(_a_) of the PCA for receiving gratification from the accused for doing acts in relation to his principal’s affairs _ie_ for advancing OHPL’s business interest with Omakase. 20 of the remaining charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. A global fine of $35,000 in default 70 days’ imprisonment was imposed on him. He was also ordered to pay a penalty of $7,476 in default 15 days’ imprisonment.

## The Prosecution's Case

21     It was the Prosecution's case that the monthly cash payments of $300 from February 2015 to January 2017 as well as the bottle of Martell Cognac, the Masamoto knife, the Louis Vuitton belt, the Bottega Venetta wallet and the two red packets that the accused gave to the head chef of Omakase between April 2015 to February 2017 were all corrupt gratification.

## The Defence's Case

22     It was the Defence’s case that there was no corrupt element behind any of the cash payments and gifts as the accused and PW2 were close friends with common interests. PW2 was employed as a consultant and the accused paid him $300 monthly for his help and advice as well as for referring new customers to him. The gifts were a gesture of his appreciation for the help PW2 had rendered on specific occasions while the red packets were customary Chinese New Year gifts.

## Issues to be determined

23     As it was undisputed that PW2 had received cash payments and gifts from the accused _ie_ the _actus reus_, the main issues for my determination were:

> (a)     Whether the gratification was an inducement or reward for helping the accused;

> (b)     whether the transactions had an objective corrupt element and

> (c)     whether the accused gave the gratification to PW2 with guilty knowledge.

## Assessment of the Evidence

24     The present case turns primarily on my determination of whether PW2’s account or the accused’s account of the nature of the various transactions between them from February 2015 to February 2017 should be preferred. I had to decide whether the cash payments and gifts to PW2 were due to the accused’s intention to obtain a benefit conferred by the PW2 at the expense of Omakase’s interest or the monthly payments were for PW2’s advice as an independent consultant and help on specific occasions as well as for his referral of new customers to OHPL.

25     I agreed with the Prosecution that where the accused is alleged to have given bribes over a period of time, it is not necessary to prove a nexus between each act of giving and a particular act done by the receiver or favour sought by the giver to be done by the receiver. In _Hassan bin Ahmad v Public Prosecutor_ at <span class="citation">\[2000\] 2 SLR(R) 567</span> at \[20\]), the High Court held:

> …The basis of the Prosecution’s case was that the appellant would periodically receive sums of money from Chua, in exchange for which the appellant would perform favours as and when required. The method of payment was not transactional in the sense that the appellant would be paid a certain sum to do a certain favour. Rather, the arrangement was more akin to a monthly retainer for services from time to time. It was therefore not necessary for the Prosecution to prove a nexus between each receipt and a particular act; it only sufficed to demonstrate that the payments were not made innocently, but to purchase the recipient’s servitude. This is the essence of being “bought over” – that the recipient of the gratification be at the beck and call of the payor, prodded into action by his recollection of the payor’s generosity even when no specific act was demanded at the time of payment.

26     Hence, for the Prosecution to prove its case, it must be shown that the monthly cash payments and the valuable gifts to PW2 were intrinsically tied to the accused’s intention of giving the gift for the purpose of obtaining a benefit conferred by the PW2 at the expense of Omakase’s interest.

27     It was the Defence’s case that it was PW2’ employer, Mr Cheng Hsin Yao (Zheng Xinyao)(PW1) who decided to purchase truffle oil from OHPL and instructed PW2 to order from OHPL. The decision was made after a blind tasting test and PW2 had not done anything in relation to Omakase’s affairs to advance OHPL’s interests with Omakase.

28     Under s 9(2) of the PCA as set out below, the fact that an agent had “no power, right or opportunity” to “show any favour or disfavour to any person” does not affect the guilt of the giver, so long as the giver had “reason to believe or suspect that the agent had the power, right or opportunity to do so.”

> **Acceptor of gratification to be guilty notwithstanding that purpose not carried out, etc.**

> 9(2)  Where, in any proceedings against any person for any offence under section 6(b), it is proved that he corruptly gave, agreed to give or offered any gratification to any agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do any act or for showing or forbearing to show any favour or disfavour to any person having reason to believe or suspect that the agent had the power, right or opportunity to do so, show or forbear and that the act, favour or disfavour was in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, he shall be guilty of an offence under that section notwithstanding that the agent had no power, right or opportunity or that the act, favour or disfavour was not in relation to his principal’s affairs or business.

In his unchallenged first statement recorded on 9 February 2017 at the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”), the accused had admitted to believing that PW2 had “the authority to recommend my products to his boss and … the capacity to influence his boss’s decision because he is the head chef of Omakase.[^1]”

29     In my view, the fact that it was PW1 who made the decision to switch suppliers and had instructed PW2 to order truffle oil from OHPL was not fatal to the Prosecution’s case. The fact remained that it was PW2 who introduced OHPL’s truffle oil to PW1 after meeting the accused and PW2 had facilitated the change in truffle oil supplier from their existing supplier. What was crucial for the Prosecution to establish was that the gratification was provided by the accused in order to advance OHPL’s interest and the accused’s belief that PW2 had the power, right or opportunity to do so at the expense of Omakase’s interest.

30     I will firstly examine the evidence pertaining to the 25 charges involving the various cash payments to PW2.

#### The monthly cash payments to PW2 – 1st charge to 24th charge

#### PW2’s testimony

31     PW2 testified that he first met the accused sometime in October 2014. He told the accused that Omakase used about 300 bottles of 250 ml truffle oil every month. At the material time, Omakase used truffle oil purchased from another company known as ‘Euraco’. According to PW2, the accused offered to pay PW2 5% for each truffle oil order if he ordered the ‘La Rustichella’ brand of truffle oil from him. PW2 further testified that after he conducted a taste test for his employer using the accused’s sample truffle oil, OHPL became Omakase’s truffle oil supplier.

32     PW2 gave evidence that during Chinese New Year period in 2015, while they were at the smoking area of The Grandstand, the accused informed him that there was some difficulty in computing the 5% figure. He instead offered PW2 $300 per month for purchasing truffle oil from him.

33     PW2 further gave evidence that from February 2015 to January 2017, the accused began paying him $300 every month. The accused would pay him either at the end of the month and at times, the beginning of the month. In total, the accused made 24 such cash payments to PW2. PW2 gave evidence that from February 2015 to September 2016, the payments were made at the smoking area at Turf City _ie_ The Grandstand. From October 2016 to January 2017, after PW2 moved to the Omakase outlet at Wisma Atria, the payments were made at the smoking area at Wisma Atria.

34     PW2 testified that the monthly payments of $300 was a bribe as when he purchased truffle oil from the accused, he would receive the money. Each time the cash was passed to PW2, the accused would thank him for his support. According to PW2, the cash was passed at the smoking area so that it would not be seen by the other staff of Omakase. PW2 also testified that he would receive a commission from the accused whenever he recommended OHPL’s truffle oil to customers.

35     PW2 gave evidence that apart from the accused, he knew Mr Sng Willie (PW3) who worked as a salesman with OHPL. The accused first introduced PW3 to PW2 after the former started working for the accused. According to PW2, the accused had mentioned about PW2 receiving $300 per month in PW3’s presence. PW3 had also witnesses the accused giving him the cash once inside the Omakase restaurant at The Grandstand.

36     PW2 further gave evidence that while he was receiving the cash and gifts from the accused, he had not informed PW1 or anyone else in Omakase about it. This was because he did not wish to let anyone know about his receipt of the money as it was a bribe from a supplier.

37     PW2 testified that on 14 June 2018, he had pleaded guilty to ten proceeded charges, consented to 20 remaining charges to be taken into consideration as well as admitted to the Statement of Fact which was collectively marked as P6[^2]. He confirmed that he was aware that these charges were for corruptly accepting gratification from one Edmund Chan Yong Ann, the director of OHPL[^3]. He identified the said person as being the accused[^4].

38     PW2 had disagreed with the Defence when it had put to him during cross-examination that he had pleaded guilty as he had no money to fight his case in Court[^5]. He disagreed when it was put to him that he did not want to contradict his plea of guilt or the Statements of Facts and was lying about receiving bribes from the accused[^6]. He denied having a friendship with the accused from 2014 to 2017.

39     In my assessment of PW2’s evidence, the present case, I was mindful that as he was the recipient of the allegedly corrupt gratification, his evidence should be treated as that of an accomplice. Nevertheless, PW2 is an accomplice who had already been convicted and sentenced for his role in the present case.

40     In the present case, I found that PW2 to be a truthful witness who had given a consistent and credible account of the nature of his relationship with the accused and the circumstances of his interactions with the accused. I accepted his evidence that in February 2015, while they were at the smoking area of The Grandstand, the accused had offered PW2 $300 per month for purchasing truffle oil from him.

41     I also accepted PW2’s evidence that from February 2015 to January 2017, the accused paid him $300 every month and that he made 24 such cash payments to PW2 for purchasing OHPL’s truffle oil. I gave full weight to PW2’s testimony that these cash payments were a form of bribe from a supplier when he purchased truffle oil from the accused.

42     I also gave full weight to PW2’s guilty plea to the charges of corruptly accepting gratification from the accused as a reward for advancing OHPL’s interest at the expense of Omakase’s interest. I rejected the Defence’s suggestion that he had done so as he had no means to fight his case in Court.

43     I accepted PW2’s evidence that he was not close friends with the accused. Accordingly, I agreed with the Prosecution and found that PW2 and the accused were not close friends but had a transactional relationship between a knowledgeable head chef and a relatively inexperienced supplier who was paying the head chef to advance his business interest with the chef’s restaurant. I rejected the Defence’s characterisation of their relationship as that of close friends with common interests.

44     In the present case, I found that there was no evidence adduced by the Defence of any motive on PW2’s part to lie about his role in the transaction and to falsely implicate the accused. I also agreed with the Prosecution that the Defence’s submissions as to why PW2 had pleaded guilty was baseless and unsubstantiated.

#### PW3’s testimony

45     PW2’s evidence that he received money from the accused was corroborated by PW3, who was a former senior sales manager of OHPL from September 2015 to September 2016.

46     PW3 testified that the accused introduced him to PW2 and told him that PW2 was paid a monthly kickback from OHPL as well as commission from the truffle oil that he sells[^7]. According to PW3, the accused told him that PW2 would get $500 every month and $3 per bottle of truffle oil that he sells[^8]. The accused also told him that this was to ensure that the business with Omakase would be ongoing and PW2 would also inform the accused if there were other suppliers coming in[^9]. It was basically a safety net to ensure that the Omakase account stayed live[^10]. The accused had told him that the money was not traceable as it would not be recorded and as such there would be no paper trail[^11].

47     PW3 gave evidence that he had witnessed the accused handing over something discreetly to PW2 on two occasions at The Grandstand smoking corner[^12]. According to PW3, the accused always told him that it was done discreetly as he cannot be seen handing over the monies and had to hide the transactions.

48     I found PW3 to be a credible and consistent witness who corroborated key aspects of PW2’s evidence. I accepted his evidence that he was told by the accused that he had paid PW2 a kickback[^13] as a reward for Omakase ordering truffle oil from OHPL. I also accepted his evidence that he was told by the accused that the payments to PW2 were made in cash so they would not leave a paper trail and be untraceable.

49     Although there was a discrepancy in the amount of cash payment, I agreed with the Prosecution that PW3 was merely testifying as to what the accused had told him and not the actual quantity of the monthly payment. Furthermore, “human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is both common and understandable” (see _Jagatheesan s/o Krishnasamy v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 4 SLR(R) 45</span> at \[82\]). In any event, the accused himself had testified that PW2 received a sum of $300 every month from him from June 2015 to January 2017.

#### The accused’s statement recorded on 9 February 2017

50     Apart from the evidence from PW2 and PW3, the Prosecution’s case was further corroborated and was consistent with the accused’s own unchallenged long statement (P13) recorded in English on 9 February 2017. In P13, the accused had described Omakase as being his biggest customer[^14]. He began giving PW2 a sum of $300 monthly starting from February 2015 to January 2017 for referring customers to his company and ordering from his company. He would usually pay PW2 at the end of the month at the Omakase branch located at The Grandstand, at Turf Club Road. He would meet him outside Omakase restaurant and pass him the money in cash[^15].

51     This is consistent with PW2’s testimony that he received the monthly cash payments from February 2015 to January 2017 outside the Omakase restaurant. Nevertheless, this account was retracted by the accused in his letters to CPIB as well as his further statements.

#### Retraction by accused of his account in paragraph 6 of P13

52     In his 2 March 2017 letter to CPIB (D18), the accused clarified that he had engaged PW2 as an independent consultant on his off days to help him introduce OHPL’s products to customers. During his cross-examination, the accused testified that D18 was prepared after the accused had retained legal counsel[^16]. He stated that after checking his records, he had engaged PW2 only in July 2015 and he paid him $300 at the end of every month and commission on any product sales he made.

53     In his subsequent 7 June 2017 letter to CPIB (D31), he clarified that he had never asked nor implied to PW2 to convince his boss to buy more products from him. According to him, PW2 was always aware that the remuneration and gifts was to thank him for supporting his business by being an independent consultant, getting him new clients and teaching him about the industry.

54     In his further statement to the CPIB recorded in English on 20 July 2017 (P14), the accused stated that he gave PW2 the sum of $300 per month as he was working part-time for him as an independent consultant. PW2 got sales for his company by referring other restaurants to him or going out on his off days and finding restaurants which became customers for his business. He further stated that the $300 was not for PW2 to order truffle oil from OHPL for Omakase. According to him no commission was given to PW2 for truffle oil ordered from Omakase.

55     At trial, the accused testified that PW2 was working for him as an independent consultant. He also testified that he commenced the practice of paying PW2 from June 2015 to February 2017[^17]. According to him, he recalled the date as being June 2015 after he had gone home and checked his data[^18]. During his cross-examination the accused disagreed that Omakase was an important customer of OHPL. This was contrary to what he had stated in P13 where the accused had described Omakase as being his biggest customer. Nevertheless, he conceded that Omakase’s potential business volume was very large and very appealing[^19].

56     What was notable was the accused’s inconsistent position on the importance of Omakase as a customer and his shifting account as to when he had first made the payment of $300 to PW2 despite his claim of having checked his records or data. I was unconvinced by the explanations provided by the accused to explain the internal inconsistencies with his own documentary evidence as I did not find the accused to be a credible witness. After a careful examination, I found his evidence to be inherently incredible and materially inconsistent.

57     Accordingly, I rejected the accused’s testimony as to when he first made the monthly cash payments in light of the internal inconsistencies in the accused’s oral and documentary evidence as set out above. Instead, I preferred PW2’s testimony that was corroborated and consistent with P13 and found that the monthly cash payments had started in February 2015 and not in either June 2015 or July 2015.

58     In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution and found that there was no conclusive evidence suggesting that PW2 was employed as an OHPL consultant. The accused’s explanation was undermined by a complete lack of documentary evidence substantiating this arrangement: there was no employment contract, payment voucher, or any other evidence that suggested a legitimate working or consultancy relationship between the accused and PW2.

59     The accused sought to explain the dearth of documentary evidence regarding PW2’s consultancy by claiming he was a “very messy, lazy person” and had not kept proper accounts for the company until late 2015[^20]. I agreed with the Prosecution that his own documentary evidence contradicted this: the monthly payments continued until early 2017, more than a year after the accused claimed to have hired someone to handle OHPL’s accounts[^21]. Yet OHPL’s records do not reflect any consultancy payment to PW2 for the entirety of 2016.

60     I also agreed with the Prosecution that his explanation that he paid for PW2’s consultancy out of his own pocket since he viewed OHPL’s funds as interchangeable with his own was unsatisfactory[^22] as his own record keeping practice contradicts this. PW2 himself had categorically denied that there was any arrangement for him to help the accused on his days off at $100 a day and on the basis of three days that he would be paid $300 per month[^23].

61     It was the Defence’s case that PW2 had nothing to do with Omakase’s purchase of truffle oil and that it was PW1 who made the decision to switch suppliers and had instructed PW2 to order truffle oil from OHPL. As explained at \[29\] above, the fact remained that it was PW2 who introduced OHPL’s truffle oil to PW1 after meeting the accused and PW2 had facilitated the change in truffle oil supplier from their existing supplier. In P13, the accused had admitted to believing that PW2 had the authority to recommend his products to his boss and the capacity to influence his boss’s decision because he is the head chef of Omakase.[^24]”. Both PW2 and PW3 had testified that the bribes or kickback was for ordering truffle oil from OHPL.

62     In my view, it was clear that the accused had endeavoured to become Omakase’s truffle oil supplier as Omakase used significant quantities of truffle oil to prepare their food. Furthermore, truffle oil was the most profitable item in the OHPL’s inventory in terms of profit margin. During his cross-examination, the accused himself agreed with the Prosecution that as truffle oil was the most profitable item, he was interested in selling as much truffle oil as possible[^25]. It was clear that the accused made monthly cash payments to PW2 to ensure that he kept Omakase’s business with OHPL live and ongoing.

63     Accordingly, I rejected the Defence’s assertion that PW2 was employed as an independent consultant on his days off and that the accused paid PW2 $300 monthly for his advice as well as referral of new customers to OHPL. The Defence did not produce an independent consultancy agreement and the accused conceded on the stand that no such formal agreement existed[^26]. In my view, the consultancy arrangement was afterthought concocted by the accused to explain and justify his monthly cash payments to PW2 from February 2015 to January 2017.

## The mens rea element

#### The corrupt intent

64     To determine the accused’s intention or ulterior motive for providing the monthly cash payments to PW2, I had considered the surrounding circumstances of the case. In the present case, after learning from PW2 that Omakase used significant quantities of truffle oil to prepare their food, the accused was keen to become Omakase’s truffle oil supplier. This was because truffle oil was the most profitable item in OHPL’s inventory in terms of profit margin and part of his growth plan.

#### The second and third elements

65     The cash payments were made by the accused to PW2 in a surreptitious manner at the smoking corner firstly at The Grandstand and subsequently at Wisma Atria. It was clear that the cash was passed at the smoking area so that both the accused and PW2 would not be seen by the other staff of Omakase and to hide the transactions. PW2 testified that he had not informed his boss or anyone else in Omakase about it as the cash payments as it was a bribe from a supplier. PW2 also testified that he understood these payments to be in return for Omakase’s purchase of truffle oil from the accused[^27]. The accused himself had told PW3 that the monthly kickback to PW2 was to ensure that the OHPL’s business with Omakase would be ongoing and PW2 would also inform the accused if there were other suppliers coming in. PW1 had testified that Omakase would have investigated had they learned of staff receiving gifts or gratification from Omakase’s suppliers[^28] and Omakase has since implemented a written policy prohibiting the receipt of compensation or gifts from suppliers.

66     Based on the above, I found that the monthly cash payments were a reward to PW2 to induce him to help the accused by continuing to order truffle oil from OHPL and such an arrangement was objectively corrupt.

67     As to the nature of their relationship, it was a transactional relationship between a knowledgeable head chef and a relatively inexperienced supplier who was paying the head chef to advance his business interest with the chef’s restaurant. The accused had made 24 monthly cash payments totalling $7200 over a period of time from February 2015 to January 2017. The payments stopped after CPIB began its investigations against the accused. From the above, I found that the monthly cash payments to PW2 were due to the accused’s corrupt intent to obtain a benefit conferred by PW2 as an agent through the continued purchase of OHPL’s the highly profitable truffle oil at the expense of Omakase’s interest.

#### The fourth element

68     In my view, it was clear that the accused knew that the monthly cash payments were corrupt gratification and he had given the gratification to PW2 with guilty knowledge. This was evident from his own documentary evidence in P13 where the accused stated that he gave the money to PW2 for ordering from his company as well as referring customers to his company. This was corroborated by PW3’s testimony that the accused told him that he had paid PW2 a kickback as a reward for Omakase ordering truffle oil from OHPL. The accused had also told PW3 that the payments to PW2 were made in cash so they would not leave a paper trail and be untraceable.

69     In my view, this was why he took steps to retract his admissions in his initial statement (P13) through his letters to CPIB _ie_ D18 and D31, his further statement (P14) as well as his testimony. I rejected his reasons for the retraction of his admissions despite not challenging P13 as it was only during his own testimony that he made several belated and unsubstantiated claims against the recorder Senior Special Investigator Muhammad Muzaffar Bin Mohamed Ali (PW4) regarding his well-being and the accuracy of P13 which were not put to PW4.

70     In his testimony, PW4 had confirmed that the accused’s statement was recorded accurately and that he was given the opportunity to review his statement with a view to amend it. In fact, the accused made multiple amendments to his statement which showed that he had in fact checked it to confirm its accuracy. I found PW4 to be a credible witness whose testimony was internally and externally consistent and he had stood firm in his evidence during his cross-examination. I agreed with the Prosecution that PW4 had no reason to lie about the accuracy of the statements he recorded from the accused.

71     I found that the accused’s admissions in P13 as to the payment of the monthly cash payments and gifts for supporting his business and the fact that the accused knew it was wrong represented the truth. I further found his admission in P13 as to why he had given PW2 the gifts and the money as he believed he had the authority to recommend OHPL products to his boss and he has the capacity to influence his boss’s decision because he was the head chef of Omakase to be the truth[^29]. I gave full weight to the admissions contained in the accused’s initial statement (P13) which was voluntary and which I found to be accurately recorded.

#### The various gifts to PW2 – 25th charge to 30th charge

72     Apart from the monthly cash payments of $300, PW2 had testified that he received a bottle of Martell Cognac, a Masamoto knife, a Louis Vuitton belt, a Bottega Venetta wallet and the two red packets containing $188 and $80 between April 2015 to February 2017 from the accused. PW2 further testified that these valuable gifts were to thank him for his support of the accused by ordering truffle oil from him.

73     PW2 further testified that the valuable items (save for the two red packets) were given in a similarly discreet manner outside and away from the restaurant. After the accused had paid for it, PW2 picked up the bottle of Martell from Changi Airport himself. The accused also gave PW2 the Louis Vuitton belt at a coffee shop at Sixth Avenue and the Bottega Venetta wallet at the smoking area at Wisma Atria.

74     In the accused’s initial statement (P13) he had stated that he gave PW2 the said gifts and money as he believed that PW2 had the authority to recommend OHPL’s products to his boss and he has the capacity to influence his boss’s decision because he is the head chef of Omakase. The accused had also wanted to thank him for supporting his business and referring business to his company. In P13, the accused stated that he did not give the other chefs at Omakase any similar gifts of money as what he had given to PW2[^30]. In his further statement recorded on 25 May 2017 at CPIB (P15), the accused stated that he had given PW2 the gifts as tokens of appreciation and to thank him for supporting his business even though he was busy with his own work.

#### Retraction by accused of his account in P13 and P15

75     Nevertheless, in his l2 March 2017 letter to CPIB (D18), the accused clarified that he did not give the gifts so that he could get any benefit or special treatment from Omakase. He stated that the personal gifts were because he was grateful for all the help and support that PW2 had given to him. He further stated that he never told or promised PW2 that he would give him anything if he helped the accused. I noted that these clarifications were made after the accused had retained legal counsel.

76     In another statement D31 recorded on 7 June 2017, the accused clarified his further statement in P15. He explained that he gave PW2 the bottle of Martell Cognac to thank him for helping him in his business by working as an independent consultant, marketing his goods to third parties and teaching him about the industry. He stated that he had given the Louis Vuitton belt because PW2 went out of his way to help him at the Food and Hotel Asia Fair in April 2016.

77     In respect of the Masamoto knife, he stated that it was a used knife and he had given it to PW2 to thank him for agreeing to sacrifice his days off and weekends to help him as an independent consultant even though he was busy with his own work at Omakase. As for the Bottega Venetta wallet, he stated that he gave it to PW2 for finding a temporary delivery driver to help him with deliveries.

78     Essentially, it was the Defence’s case that these were bona fide gifts to PW2 that were not corruptly given as a reward to him for having done acts to advance OHPL’s business interests with Omakase. Instead, the gifts were for PW2’s support and help PW2 had rendered as OHPL’s independent consultant.

#### The corrupt intent

79     In order to determine the accused intent behind the valuable gifts, I had similarly considered the circumstances of the case, the manner they were given, the nature of their relationship, the size of the gratification and whether the acts involved breaking of rules or code of conduct.

#### The second and third elements

80     In the present case, as highlighted earlier the valuable gifts were given to PW2 in a surreptitious manner in a similarly discreet manner outside and away from the restaurant. Only the two red packets were given to PW2 at the Omakase restaurant during the Chinese New Year period in 2016 and 2017. In my view, if there was no corrupt intent or ulterior motive behind the giving of such valuable gifts, there was no need for the accused to give them to PW2 in such a surreptitious manner if they were indeed close friends with common interests. In any event, I accepted PW2’s testimony that were not close friends.

81     In the accused’s initial statement (P13), when asked why he had given PW2 the gifts and money, he had stated that it was due to his belief that PW2 had the authority to recommend OHPL’s products to his boss and he has the capacity to influence his boss’s decision because he is the head chef of Omakase. In both P13 and P15, the accused had stated that he had given PW2 the gifts as he wanted to thank PW2 for supporting his business and referring business to his company.

82     I agreed with the Prosecution that the gifts were of substantial value and/or from designer brands. There was no other plausible reason for the accused to consistently giving such extravagant items to PW2 other than their being objectively corrupt. I also agreed that the red packets that the accused gave PW2 were consistently of magnitude larger than other red packets the accused gave to the other staff at Omakase during Lunar New Year.

83     Although the accused had claimed that the red packets were nothing more than customary auspicious Chinese New Year gifts, no other explanation was provided as to why PW2 was given significantly more than other recipients of the red packets apart from stating that it was a token of appreciation to PW2 for supporting his business. I agreed with the Prosecution that the nature and circumstances surrounding the giving of these valuable items and red packets lead to the irresistible inference that they too were corrupt gratification.

84     As stated above, the accused and PW2 had a transactional relationship where a relatively inexperienced supplier was providing gratification to a knowledgeable head chef to advance his business interest with the chef’s restaurant. Furthermore, PW2 himself had denied during his cross-examination that these items were symbols of friendship and common interests.

85     Based on the above, I found that the valuable gifts were a form of reward to PW2 to induce or motivate him to help the accused by continuing to order truffle oil from OHPL at the expense of Omakase’s interest and such an arrangement was objectively corrupt. Accordingly, I rejected the accused’s testimony in respect of the valuable gifts in light of the internal inconsistencies in the accused’s oral and documentary evidence as set out above.

#### The fourth element

86     In my view, it was clear that the accused knew that the valuable gifts were corrupt gratification and he had given them to PW2 with guilty knowledge. This was evident from his own documentary evidence in P13 where the accused stated that he gave the gifts to PW2 as he believed PW2 had the authority to recommend OHPL products to his boss and he had the capacity to influence his boss’s decision because he was the head chef of Omakase. The accused further stated that he wanted to thank PW2 for supporting his business and referring business to his company.

87     I disagreed with the Defence’s submissions that the accused had given gifts to PW2 on four occasions as a gesture of his appreciation for specific things that PW2 had helped him with. Instead, I preferred PW2’s testimony that was corroborated and consistent with P13 and found that that these valuable gifts were to thank him for his support of the accused by ordering truffle oil from him.

88     I also gave full weight to PW2’s guilty plea to the charges of corruptly accepting gratification from the accused as a reward for advancing OHPL’s interest at the expense of Omakase’s interest. I rejected the Defence’s suggestion that he had done so as he had no means to fight his case in Court.

89     As it was clear that the accused knew that valuable gifts were corrupt gratification, this was why he had retracted his admissions in his statements _ie_ P13 and P15 in his letters to CPIB in D18 and D31. I rejected his reasons for the retraction of his admissions and found that the admissions in P13 and P15 that the gifts were for PW2 supporting his business and the fact that the accused knew it was wrong represented the truth.

#### Conclusion

90     I agreed with the Prosecution that the totality of the evidence proved both the objective corrupt element of the transactions in this case and accused’s subjective guilty knowledge. It was clear from the oral and documentary evidence before me that the accused knew he was engaging in a corrupt and illicit transaction by paying PW2 $300 monthly and plying him with other valuable items and red packets, thus satisfying the _mens rea_ element of the offences. In my view, it was clear from the evidence that PW2 had no apparent or plausible reason to frame the accused. The Defence has not provided any evidence of any motive for PW2 to lie and give false evidence in court.

91     After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I was satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established its case in respect of the 30 charges from DAC 936597-2017 to DAC 936626-2017 beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted him on all the charges.
