28 July 2021

### District Judge Marvin Bay:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This case concerns a set of proceedings brought by the State against the accused; Ms Ng Siew Wai Carol (“Ms Ng”), a Singaporean, aged 57 under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Chapter 65A, Rev Ed 2000) (“CDSA”). These included two proceeded charges in connection with her dealings with one “_Harvey Hardman_” (“_Harvey_”) in late 2015, where she had opened accounts in two banks despite having, what the prosecution contends to be, reasonable grounds for belief that the eponymous _Harvey_ was engaged in criminal conduct. Another brace of charges involved her assistance of the said _Harvey_ in receiving deposits placed in another bank account, again despite having what the prosecution regarded as reasonable ground to believe that these monies were his benefits of criminal conduct.

### Assistance of the principal “Harvey” despite earlier allegations of fraud against the same person

2       The accused’s principal contention was that she had been ignorant of _Harvey’s_ criminal intent, or that _Harvey_ had been a scam artist. This was set against a factual matrix riddled with undisputed facts which were plainly adverse to Ms Ng’s case. These include Mdm Ng having **_previously_** (in 2013) already been the victim of a scam, albeit by an individual (or possibly a group) using a different moniker (“_Andy Clayton_”)[^1]. Additionally, Ms Ng had in the course of her dealings with _Harvey_, had actually filed a police report against _Harvey_ himself and another person in April 2014 (which was before the date of the alleged offences in the proceeded charges) alleging that **_she_** had been the victim of a parcel scam.[^2]

3       In seized messages, which were also undisputed. Ms Ng had in a message on 17 March 2014, berated _Harvey_ for making her go deeper into debt if “_all these are frauds_”.[^3]Ms Ng had followed this with a message to _Harvey_ on 13 April 2014, where she had ruefully opined “_Maybe this is after all a scam_” and accusing _Harvey_ (who had apparently ignored her calls for several days) of having possessed “_the intention to cheat me from day one_”.[^4] Ms Ng had then gone on the next day (14 April 2014) to pen an email where she expressed conviction that she was “_convinced this is a fraud and scam_.”, demanded an explanation as to “_Why do you have to do this to me_”, lamenting that “_Because of all this, I’m now penniless and heavily in debt_.” Ms Ng had also warned darkly for _Harvey_ to “_Remember someone is watching you above and there will be retribution_”.[^5] Ms Ng’s explanation for this series of seemingly histrionic outbursts was that _Harvey_ had continued to ignore her. Despite the above, Ms Ng had assisted _Harvey_ in opening several bank accounts and collecting the deposits from another bank account a year-and-a-half later in October 2015 (being the subject matter of the first section 44 CDSA charge) and 12 November to 18 December 2015 (in connection with the second section 44 CDSA charge). Most perplexing of all would be Ms Ng commission of her latest offence using another account **_after_** the earlier accounts that she had purposely opened for _Harvey_ had been frozen. Ms Ng’s response was essentially that “_Harvey told me it_ (the monies in the account) _was ‘clean’ and legalised_” and “_I literally took it at face value_”.[^6]

## THE CHARGES AND THE LAW

4       Ms Ng claimed trial to four distinct charges. These comprised two charges under section 44 (1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Chapter 65A, Rev Ed 2000) (“CDSA”); and two charges under section 47(3) CDSA.

5       Ms Ng is charged under section 44(1)(a) CDSA which creates an offence for:

> 44.— (1)    …(A)ny person who enters into or is otherwise concerned in an arrangement, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that, by the arrangement —

>> (a)    the retention or control by or on behalf of another (referred to in this section as that other person) of that other person’s benefits of criminal conduct is facilitated (whether by concealment, removal from jurisdiction, transfer to nominees or otherwise);

> 44-(5)    …shall be liable on conviction —

>> (a)    if the person is an individual, to a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both…

### The section 44(1)(a) CDSA charges

6       The first two charges under section 44, CDSA involved Ms Ng being concerned in an arrangement _Harvey_ to allow him to use bank accounts with UOB and HSBC which Ms Ng had specially opened, despite having reasonable grounds to believe that _Harvey_ was engaged in criminal conduct, and that this arrangement enabled Harvey to assume the benefits of criminal conduct. The **first[^7]** of these two charges states:

> (_Ms Ng is_) charged that (she), on or about **16 October 2015**, in Singapore, (_was_) concerned in an arrangement with one “Harvey”, to wit, by agreeing to let (_her_) **HSBC** Savings A/C (_number ending_ 0) be used to receive a total sum of **$ 27,600**[^8] from Harvey, having reasonable grounds to believe that the said Harvey was engaged in criminal conduct, and having reasonable grounds to believe that by the said arrangement, the control of Harvey’s benefits of criminal conduct is facilitated, (_she had_) thereby committed an offence under section 44(1)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Chapter 65A, Rev Ed 2000) (“**CDSA**”) punishable under section 44(5)(a) of the said Act. \[Emphasis added\]

7       The other charge under section 44 (1)(a) CDSA is broadly similar, save for differing particulars as to date and time, and amount involved. That charge[^9] spans a period between **_12 November 2015_** to **_18 December 2015_**, where Ms Ng had arranged to allow _Harvey_ to use a **_UOB_** savings account (number ending 5) where a sum of **_$72 050_** had been received for _Harvey’s_ benefit, despite her possessing reasonable grounds to believe that he had been engaged in criminal conduct, and that she was thereby an accessory to the facilitation of the ill-gotten monies to _Harvey’s_ control.

### The section 47(3) CDSA charges

8       Section 47(3) and 47(6)(a) of the CDSA provide that:

> 47(3) Any person who, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property is, or in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, represents, another person’s benefits from criminal conduct, acquires that property, or has possession of or uses such property, shall be guilty of an offence.

> 47(6) Any person who commits an offence under this section shall be liable on conviction —

>> (a)    if the person is an individual, to a fine not exceeding $500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both

9       The latter set of charges involve two instances of Ms Ng assisting _Harvey_ receive proceeds placed in Ms Ng’s DBS/POSB account. The third charge[^10], which is under section 44(1)(a) of the CDSA, alleged the offence to have been committed on or about **6 November 2015**, where Ms Ng had used a **POSB** savings account (number ending 1) to receive a total sum of **$10 000** from the said _Harvey_.

10     The fourth charge under section 47(3) of the said Act, is in relation to an act committed a day later, and states:

> (_Ms Ng is_) charged that (_she_), on or about **7 November 2015**, in Singapore, did acquire property which you had reasonable grounds to believe, in whole directly represented one _Harvey’s_ benefits from criminal conduct, to wit, by using (_her_) POSB Savings A/C (ending 1)to receive a total sum of **_$4,000_** from Harvey, (_she had_) thereby committed an offence under section 47(3) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Chapter 65A, Rev Ed 2000) (“**CDSA**”) punishable under section 47(6)(a) of the said Act.

## AGREED STATEMENT OF FACTS

### Stipulation as to certain facts

11     The proceedings have been considerably simplified by parties’ agreement to tender an Agreed Statement of Facts[^11]. This document has had a salutary effect in showing which areas were not in contention, and this allowing a more directed focus on the genuine areas of dispute between the respective cases for prosecution and defence. The Statement stipulates the following account to be mutually agreed:

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

### Prosecution witnesses

14     The was largely no dispute over the events forming the factual matrix (which were generally supported by a mass of documentary evidence, not least the prolific email and text message communications between Ms Ng and _Harvey_) the main difference was the prosecution’s contention that Ms Ng should have had reasonable grounds to believe that the aforesaid Harvey was engaged in criminal conduct, and that by the arrangements she had entered into, the control of Harvey’s benefits of criminal conduct would be facilitated. Ms Ng’s defence was that she had acted without any such suspicion that she was an accessory in any such criminal dealings.

15     This being the case, the prosecution has largely centred on setting out the circumstances where Ms Ng had encountered investigation officers, particularly in the instances **_before_** she had opened the bank accounts from which _Harvey_ had perpetrated his fraudulent activities. I should add that there was no significant challenge to the testimonies of the witnesses, which principally centred on their brief encounters with Ms Ng during the recording sessions. There was also rather minimal cross-examination of the witnesses, and thus little was changed from the prosecution’s case, which was, _inter alia_, premised on her continuing to offend, despite administered warnings that the transfers were liked to illicit transactions. Given the paucity of challenge, my narration will focus on the nine statements Ms Ng recorded before various investigation officers, to parse out issues of what Ms Ng knew of _Harvey_, and when she knew or ought to have known.

16     The prosecution had initially proposed a list of 12 witnesses which had included representatives from four involved banks (HSBC, UOB, OCBC and DBS/POSB), a well as the three victims. The need for such an expansive list had been obviated by the stipulations in the Agreed Statement of Facts, and the five witnesses eventually called were police officers who had dealt with Ms Ng at various points of time between 2015 and 2017:

> (i)     PW1 Liew Yao Hui (“Officer Liew”)

> (ii)     PW 2 Seet Hui Li

> (iii)     PW 3 Rajiv Makalingam (“Inspector Rajiv, Officer Rajiv”)

> (iv)     PW 4 Andrew Ong Zhongyi

> (v)     PW 5 Alan Tan Hock Sim

## Evidence of PW1 Liew Yao Hui

### Investigation into fraudulent payment to accused’s OCBC account

17     Officer Liew, the first prosecution witness, had seen Ms Ng on 6 October 2015, when she had attended to assist an investigation. The investigation itself had been prompted by a complainant by a victim who had on 18 September 2015, deposited sums into an OCBC account linked to Ms Ng. The complainant felt she had been cheated as the person whom she had regarded as a “_boyfriend_” had persisted in demanding sums of money from her, and she suspected that she had become the victim of a love scam.[^26] As the bank account had been traced to Ms Ng, he had called Ms Ng to attend.

18     In relation to this fraud, a police report[^27] that had been lodged by one **_Cheah Lee Kean_**, aged 41. The report is set out in its entirety below. In that report, Ms Cheah, the complainant, had stated that:

> On April of year 2015, I knew Elvin Yong Sung from Facebook, I had added him as a friend.

> On 19/7/2015, we are in a boy and girl friend relationship. We had been communicated(_sic_) with one another by Facebook Messenger and Whatspps(_sic_).

> On 17/8/2-15, he had some jobs in Cambodia and informed me that he will fly over from Cambodia to Singapore to meet me.

> On 25/8/2015, he showed me three air tickets itinerary and the first two are wrong itinerary because I had called to check with the airline company.

> **_On 26/8/2015, he asked me to transfer $2K USD to his agent (Carole Siew Ng) in Singapore because he had to pay taxes in Cambodia_**, he didn’t have enough money at the moment. I questioned him and he gave me a lot of excuses. Finally I gad transferred $2K USD Dollars (Equate to $2800 Singapore dollars) to OCBC account (ending-1).

> On 27/8/2015, he informed me that he could not fly over to Singapore because his taxes have not been paid. He informed me that his friend could not pay for him also and he has been asking money from me.

> I had done some of background research and I found out the information that he gave me was totally wrong. I had also booked a 5 star hotel at Park Royal for him on 27/8/2015 and which costs me $530 Singapore dollars.

> **_I suspected he is getting second victim now_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

19     When Ms Ng had attended before Officer Liew, she had confirmed the OCBC account to be her own. Ms Ng was told that the complainant had deposited $2 800 on 26 August 2015 and had thereafter suspected that she had become the victim of a scam. Ms Ng had claimed that she had opened the account with a business partner whom, was Officer Liew recalled, she referred to as one “_Harvey Hartman_”[^28]

## Police report filed by accused herself in a previous love scam

### Juxtaposing the report filed by victim Cheah Lee Kean and the accused when she previously victimised by a love scam

20     Before going further, it would be _apropos_ to set out the instance where Ms Ng herself had filed a police report asserting that she had been the victim of a love scam. A juxtaposition would show similarities in the experiences of the two women, to the extent of both Ms Cheah Lee Kean and Ms Ng ending their reports with firm convictions that they had been scammed. Ms Ng’s report (set out _verbatim_ and uncorrected for grammar and style errors) filed on 4 March 2014, states[^29]:

> On 4 feb, my friend Harvey hardman Whom I had met on the internet on B2 Site for three months, had sent me a baggage from Chicago containing USD 200k, and I was to receive I at my home. We have been in contact via Email as well as through text messages and calls.

> On 6 Feb 2014, at 9 Am, I was contacted by Cat from, Coast to Coast Delivery who had informed me that my baggage of USD 200K had been classified as ‘International Classified Baggage’ by the KL Airport.

> Subsequently, she had infd me that if I wanted the money I had to pay USD$100 for the airport clearance for me to get the money. I had transferred money to her on four occasions for the following reasons:

> (_five entries between 7-27 February 2014 for payments amounting to $34 800 for ‘airport clearance’, ‘penalty for sending cash by mail’. 'anti-terrorist certificates’ and ‘anti laundering certificates’ et cetera_)

> On 28/2/2014, Cat had further asked me fo USD$6600 for Demurrage (Security Service with code) which I refused to pay as I have been paying too much.

> All payments were made to Beneficiary name: Lenny Anak William Naig

> (_addresses and particulars_)

> **_As I feel that this is a scam, I have decided to come to the police for assistance._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Statement recorded by Officer Liew from accused pursuant to victim Chia Lee Kean’s report

21     During the session, Officer Liew recorded a statement from Ms Ng. While this was one of ten police statements recorded from Ms Liew by various investigation officers exhibited as part of the prosecution’s case, Ms Ng’s first statement is especially significant as the document was created **_before_** the time she had committed the acts which constituted the offences for the four charges she faced. The first statement would thus give an insight to what she knew of _Harvey_ by her candid statements made at a time when she was not herself the subject of an investigation.

22     The statement begins with Ms Ng stating that she was a divorcee with two grown children (who were in their twenties) and having worked Nokia Solutions for the past 14 years. The substantive part of her statement starts from \[2\] onwards where she states:

> 2    In the end of September 2015, I wanted to transfer money out of my OCBC bank account number (_ending with 1_) but the transaction was unsuccessful. After that I decided to call OCBC and was informed by the operator my bank account was being frozen by the Police. After that I managed to contact the Investigation Officer and **_happen to know that this bank account had been used by somebody else to commit a crime_**.

> 3    The following questions are posed to me by the recording officer and my answers are as follows:

>> Q1    (question)

>> A1    The OCBC bank account was opened in my name, **_and I am the only person using it, The account was opened in April 2013_**.

>> Q2    (question)

>> A2    I opened the bank account for my small business purpose, I operated a service to organise wedding functions in Singapore and Malaysia. I shared this small business with my business partner in Malaysia. My business partner is namely Harvey Hardman (_mobile number_) and he is based in Malaysia. I knew him about 2 years ago and I knew him through my friends. We will usually communicate through whats app (_sic_) and calls. **_Harvey does not have any access to my bank account. I am the only one who held on to the ATM card and ibanking rights_**. I gave Harvey my bank account to give to our clients to transfer money into and I will use the money inside to arrange for wedding for our clients.

>> Q3    (question)

>> A3     **_I do not know how the bank account had been misused as the bank account number will be given to clients who wanted to engage my company service. Harvey and I only provide this wedding service arrangement and organising to friends._** If my friend’s friend would like to engage our service, we will also help to organise the wedding. My clients ate usually introduced to me though friends and promoted by word of mouth. You can see that most of the transactions in my bank account are withdrawals from Malaysia. **_The deposits are made by me and the bank transfers are made by me as they are money collected from my clients for the wedding service_**, I do not know the existence of the $2800 transfer to my bank on 26/08/2015 until the bank account was frozen by the Police, I am willing to pay back the money to the victim as informed by the police.

> (Affirmed true and correct)

> Statement concluded on 6/10/2015 at 3.50 pm.

### Caution administered by PW1 not to open any more bank accounts

23     Officer Liew specifically recalled cautioning the accused after the above statement had been recorded. Explaining why he had categorically told her “_not to open any more bank accounts for people she doesn’t know, and specifically for this Mr. ‘Harvey”_, PW1 explained that he had issued this warning to her as he had noted Ms Ng’s explanation that her actions were at the behest of her “business partner”, _Harvey_. He had also taken stock of her reasoning that “_there must be some miscommunication, or there’s something wrong_.” He had therefore seen fit to caution her “_Since you find that, this ‘Harvey’ is suspicious, you should not do anything more for him, and also do not open any more bank account_(s)”.[^30]

24     The learned DPP indicated that the $2800 lost by Ms Cheah did not form the basis for any charge against the accused, as the prosecution had taken the view that the required _mens rea_ to found a conviction against Ms Ng would have formed this necessary _mens rea_ to for the commission of the offences “_only after this date, or at the least after this interview_ (with Officer Liew)”[^31]. This was of course predicated on Officer Liew’s unequivocal warning for Ms Ng not to open any more bank accounts, and communicating his impression of her described partner, _Harvey_ as a suspicious character.

### Salient observations from accused’s rendition of events in initial police statement

25     My observations at this point would be that Ms Ng had asserted that she held the ATM card for the frozen OCBC account and also all _ibanking_ facilities. This demonstrated that she was fully **_conscious_** of the need give a semblance that she was in control of the accounts, when the finger of suspicion had been lain on _Harvey_. This awareness would be an especially inculpatory detail, which would be irreconcilable with the accused subsequently **_giving_** the ATM cards for the new UOB account that she had opened to _Harvey_ and **_allowing_** him to operate the HSBC and DBS/POSB accounts **_after_** this interview in November 2015.

26     Another incongruous aspect would be Ms Ng’s attempt to foster an impression that she and _Harvey_ had been running a legitimate business that handled wedding arrangements. This was not borne out at all in the copious volume of subsequently recovered text messages between the two persons which were replete with personal communications of affirmation of affection, often after quarrels when Harvey failed to respond to Ms Ng’s calls or text messages.

27     It was nowhere evident within the communications between the two that any serious commercial undertaking was being discussed. This was not at all congruent with the running of a wedding business, which were time-sensitive and logistic-heavy where one would expect that arrangements such as bridal fittings, bouquets, location shoots and banquet preparations should have featured heavily in their text exchanges, It should be noted that Ms Ng, in a statement taken after she was formally designated as a suspect, subsequently **_pivoted_** from this position to state that she did not have any direct business interests with _Harvey_, but that he had loaned large sums to a business partner, and saddled her with liabilities that she had to personally bear. This will be more fully covered in the next part of these grounds.

### Accused distances herself in subsequent statement recorded by Officer Liew on 16 November 2016

28     At this juncture, it would be apposite to note Ms Ng’s adroit about-turn in change of position in another statement recorded by Officer Liew more than **_one year later_** on 16 November 2016[^32], in a handwritten addition to the penultimate portion of this later statement, where she states at \[7\]:

> I wish to add on that I need to clarify on the first statement I had given on 6/10/2015 reference to this case. **_I had_** **_no interest_** **_in any business and did_** **_not share_** **_any business with Harvey. The small business that I mentioned dealing with wedding services is Harvey’s friend_**(sic) **business**. I am sorry for the confusion in my earlier statement.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Positions taken in the two statements recorded one year apart before Officer Liew are irreconcilable

29     I would only note that this is a stark contrast from her first statement to Officer Liew in October 2015, where she had sought to impress that she had “_opened the bank account for_ **_my_** _small business purpose_”. She had also sought to convince that she had personal oversight in her response that “**_I operated_** _a service to organise wedding functions in Singapore and Malaysia._ **_I shared_** _this small business with my business partner_ (naming _Harvey_ as her business partner) _in Malaysia_”. Ms Ng had also then represented that she had a direct hand in operations in stating “**_I_** _will use the money inside to_ **_arrange_** _for wedding for_ **_our_** _clients_**_._**”[^33] No other business partner or “friend of _Harvey_” was in sight as her assertion was then that “**_Harvey and I_** _only provide this wedding service arrangement and organising to friends_.” Adding an assurance that _Harvey_ had no access to her bank account, as she was the only one who held on to the ATM card and _ibanking_ rights, she had then inserted herself as the central controlling figure in this alleged bridal services business, which was a position she subsequently became keen to distance herself from, one year later.

## Post arrest statements

### Evidence of PW2 Seet Hui Li

30     Ms Ng had met ASP Seet Hui Li after she herself had become a person of interest on 23 November 2015, when the latter was a senior investigation officer at the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD). ASP Seet had been posted to the Financial Investigation Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department at the time she offered her testimony.

### Accused’s disclosure of previous financial loss from her victimisation in an earlier scam

31     ASP Seet recorded a detailed statement from Ms Ng[^34]. In the statement, Ms Ng had indicated her status as a _divorcee_ with two grown children, a daughter aged 27 who had completed tertiary education and 18-year-old son[^35]. Ms Ng stated that she had been in difficult financial straits from the time of her divorce, and owed sums to UOB, Standchart Bank, DBS and OCBC. Her liabilities had snowballed to some $80 000 at the time of the statement. She had attributed her situation to three principal causes. In relation to the first two she had been making repayments of only the minimum sum each month, and had incurred liabilities on her daughter’s education. The third was more cogent to the present case. Ms Ng disclosed that “**_I was also involved in a scam sometime in 2013, I forked out quite a substantial sum to the scammer_**_. I did lodge a police report on this matter_.” [^36]

### The accused’s employment in responsible positions suggests her ability to make sound judgment calls and understand implications of her actions

32     I noted that despite her travails Ms Ng had maintained stable employment with Nokia Solutions Network for the 14 years preceding her statement. Ms Ng described her role as that of an executive assistant, whose work “_encompasses providing administrative support to senior executive_(s)” where she would “_handled their travel schedule and calendar management_” for which she was compensated by a monthly emolument of $4 800. Her first employment had been with Phillips, where she had stayed for a decade, and she had held a “_secretariat position_”[^37] in other industries in the intervening period. I pause her to observe that Ms Ng’s continued employment and the nature of her work would have shown her to be a person with significant intelligence, as well as reasoning capacity to plan and make meticulous arrangements for executives. Nothing in her employment history would suggest she suffered any cognitive impairment which would inhibit her ability of grasp the implications of her actions.

33     In relation to her bank accounts, Ms Ng informed ASP Seet that[^38]:

> I have an account with **_HSBC_** which is set up in **_late Sep 2015. This account is used to facilitate the receiving of monies from a friend whom I met online_**.

> Other than this, I also have an **_OCBC_** account which was set up in **_July 2015. This account was also used to facilitate the receiving of monied from this online friend_**.

> I also hold an account with DBS. This account is used for the crediting of my monthly pay and daily usage.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Initial Deposit to HSBC account opened in September 2015

34     Ms Ng also admitted to having on 22 and 30 September 2015, received two sums of 45 736.33 and $49 236.72 into the HSBC account that she had opened at the behest of this online friend, who was, of course _Harvey_.

### Accused’s specious claims on the nature of her relationship with Harvey

35     In response to ASP Seet’s question, she proceeded at length to relate the inception of her relationship with Harvey, to the point of her acquiescence to receiving sums from him. She states: [^39]

> Sometime in 2013, I met Harvey, a Caucasian through B2 site, a social networking website. He told me he is from the States and working on a contract with Exxon Mobile(_sic_). He was a divorcee as well and he was one year my senior. Initially we corresponded over email but because he was often offshore, I thought it was easier to correspond over SMS-es and Viber. When we first started to know each other, he sent me photos of himself through email. Throughout our two years acquaintance. **_I have met him up in person once or twice and it was in_** **_Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_**. The last time I met him in person was sometime in late 2013/early 2014. Other than using Viber, do call each other and Harvey’s contact number is (number). **_I wish to state_** **_we are not in a relationship but just friends who are on very good terms_**.

> \[Emphasis added, with underlined emphasis intended for cross-reference with other statements\]

36     While it was the case that no evidence was adduced in the course of proceedings either to substantiate or challenge Ms Ng’s contention that she had met _Harvey_ in person only on one or two occasions, her claim that the two were not in a relationship but “_just friends who are on very good terms_” was rendered rather specious by the acquisition of the email and chat transcripts set out in the annexes to P-1, which showed a considerable emotional and romantic investment on the relationship, particularly on the part of the accused, where she had demonstrated a degree of jealousy and anger in instances where she had discerned a lack of reciprocity by _Harvey_. This aspect will be studied in greater detail in the latter part of these grounds, along with her evolving characterisation of her relationship with _Harvey_ which morphed as successive statements were recorded.

### Accused’s use of circular reasoning in explaining her trust in Harvey

37     Ms Ng had also provided a retrospective narration to ASP Seet of how she had come to receive monies for _Harvey_. Given the significance of this aspect of their interactions to the proceedings, salient parts of her account are set out below[^40]:

> Harvey’s request for help came in sometime Jul/Aug 2015 when he asked if he could use my bank account to help some friends with transactions. I asked him what sort of transactions he is referring to, Harvey just said that he is being asked by his friend to assist in receiving some funds for a legitimate business. But because he is a foreigner, he could not open a bank account in Malaysia, and thus required my help to do so.

> Upon hearing this**_, I did question Harvey on why is there a need to rope him his help since the friend who is Malaysian could have received the monies himself. Harvey said h did not ask the friend much and because he is in a foreign land, he finds it hard to reject his friend’s request_**.

> **_After listening to his reasoning. I decided to assist Harvey because I trusted him. Harvey assured me that all these monies were legitimate and thus, I did not doubt on the source of the monies that I received_**. At that point of time Harvey did not indicate how many times I will be receiving these monies and also the quantum which will be going into my bank account. I only know that once the monies are credited into my account, Harvey will prompt me and I will check on my account.

38     There was a curious circularity of reasoning which belied the fact that Ms Ng was a mature woman who routinely dealt with scheduling and travel arrangements for senior executives at her places of employment and would thus have been expected to understand how international financial transactions functioned. She had, from her own account, possessed the wherewithal to be suspicious that Harvey’s reason to help a native-born Malaysian friend receive monies in his own country seemed facile, but uncritically accepted _Harvey’s_ bizarre ‘_reasoning_’ that he had to accede to his friend’s irrational request as it was awkward for him to point this incongruity out, as he (_Harvey_) was just a stranger in Malaysia. Ms Ng’s reasoning becomes even more opaque in her statement that “…_I decided to assist Harvey because I trusted him. Harvey assured me that all these monies were legitimate and thus, I did not doubt on the source of the monies that I received._”

39     Essentially Ms Ng’s statement is she had assisted as she trusted _Harvey_, **_with the trust resting on the sole premise that he had_** **_told_** **_her to trust him_** that the monies were legitimate. By the end of the trial, after I had heard Ms Ng’s testimony, I was of the view that Ms Ng was far from oblivious of the likely illicit _provenance_ of the sums appearing in the various bank accounts but was consciously avoiding making, or acting on, any judgment call which could have compromised or meant the end of her relationship with _Harvey_.

40     The rest of Ms Ng’s statement, as recorded by ASP Seet, did nothing to detract from the impression that she had abdicated exercising judgment on the propriety and legality of what she was doing, upon _Harvey’s_ persistent blandishments and appeals to their relationship, even as the latter embroiled her in more transactions (and even inveigling to have her post debit cards linked to the account to enable his withdrawal of monies in Malaysia), and gave similarly facile and improbable explanations when enlisting her help, which Ms Ng, from her own account, uncritically accepted.

### Accused’s modus operandi in facilitating usage of account by Harvey

41     Ms Ng had first set up a dedicated OCBC account to tend to Harvey’s needs, as she did not wish for there to be any intermingling with her own DBS account which was for her own personal usage. From her own account “_The banking details were furnished to Harvey through phone call. I had an arrangement with Harvey as well. I agreed to provide him with the debit card of my OCBC account to facilitate his cash withdrawal in Malaysia_”[^41]. Ms Ng had also arranged for _Harvey_ to tell her prior to “_any transaction_ (going) _through_ (her OCBC) _account_”. A week after the account was set up, Ms Ng had been notified that a sum of $30 000 had been deposited. By their prior arrangement, _Harvey_ was able to make a succession of direct withdrawals of $5000 (as the debit card had a daily $5000 limit). Ms Ng purported not to check on Harvey’s “_withdrawal pattern, as the monies do not belong to me and I am only assisting on the receiving end_.”[^42]

### Accused’s blasé reaction despite being called by police over the OCBC account withdrawals

42     Ms Ng noted a series of smaller transactions which ranged from the $2800 (from Ms Cheah) and $5000-$6000 before the OCBC account was frozen, and she was called to attend at a police station for her first encounter with PW1, Officer Liew in October 2015. Ms Ng’s reaction was to check with _Harvey[^43]_:

> After being called up by the police, I did call Harvey to check on the matter, he said he couldn’t get in contact with that person, Steve who sought his help on the matter. Harvey tried to call and email Steve but to no avail.

43     Rather curiously, after what ought have been a reality check when Ms Ng realised that the OCBC account she had opened had attracted police attention, she did not see fit to clarify with _Harvey_ what the transfers had been for because[^44]:

> I did not (_check with Harvey_), I presumed it was for the purpose of helping that friend who is running a legitimate business. **_I trusted Harvey that he will not land me into trouble, thus I did not even ask for any documentation or whatsoever._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

44     It should be recalled at this juncture that Ms Ng’s reposed confidence in _Harvey_ that he would _“not land_ (her) _in trouble_” in November 2015 came just some 18 months after she had accused him of cheating her and perpetrating acts where she had been _“convinced this is a fraud and scam”_ done with “_the intention to cheat me from day one_” in respect of an earlier and unrelated series of transactions, which led to their dispute being documented in a copious stream of messages exchanged between March to April 2014.

### Accused’s reason for persisting to open the new account at HSBC

45     Rather than take the police investigations to the OCBC account following Ms Cheah’s complaint as the proverbial wake-up call, Ms Ng had, to use a colloquial reference, ‘doubled down’ by setting up the HSBC account. The following shows Ms Ng to be fully aware that the OCBC account had been ordered by the police to be frozen, and yet, she had brazenly proceeded to set up the HSBC account and receive amounts from the account:[^45]

>   
| 

Question 13:

 | 

Why is there a need to set a HSBC account since the OCBC account is used to facilitate the receiving of monies?

 |
| 

Answer 13:

 | 

The reason for doing so is because after the SGD 2800 incident (ie _Ms Cheah’s police complaint_), **_the account was frozen by the bank so there is no way I could use that account to receive those funds._**

 |
| 

Question 14;

 | 

Did you check with OCBC bank on the reason that the account was frozen?

 |
| 

Answer 14:

 | 

**_I was informed by the bank that the account was frozen by the police_**.

 |
| 

…

 |
| 

Answer 17:

 | 

I did not receive notification from either bank (_ie OCBC and HSBC_). I **_knew that I was investigated by the police after I checked my OCBC account through internet banking._** I noticed the account was no longer active and after making a call to clarify, I realised the account was freeze_(sic_) by the police.

 |

  
  

### Mode of use of the HSBC account

46     As indicated in the foregoing, Ms Ng had used this new HSBC account to receive two large sums of $45 736.33 and $49 236.72 on 22 and 30 September 2016. She had also received smaller sums of _“$10 000 plus_” and others of “_minor quantum of about few thousands_”. Ms Ng had used the same _modus_ of sending the HSBC debit cards to _Harvey_ by registered post in Malaysia, this time with a withdrawal limit of $10 000 per day, with similar notifications of impending deposits from _Harvey_ being conveyed to her. The accused expressed the same _blasé_ sentiments of unconcern in relation to the provenance of the monies received: “_I also assumed that the monies were received_ **_on the_** **_pretext_** **_of_** _helping Harvey’s friend so I did not probe at all_” [^46]and “_As usual I do not interfere with how the monies are withdrawn since_ **_those are not my monies and thus, not my concern as well_**_. My duty is to help to receive, that’s all_”[^47] In relation to the word ‘_pretex_t’, ASP Seet indicated that she had faithfully recorded each word as Ms Ng gave her statement, and could not remember the context upon which the word ‘_pretext_’ was used.[^48]

## Evidence of PW4 ASP Andrew Ong

47     ASP Ong was the fourth prosecution witness but the statement he recorded on 8 December 2015 would be the third in the sequence of statements. In the statement recorded before ASP Ong, Ms Ng had gone into considerable detail to explain how she had come know _Harvey_, and also the connection between her previous police report in 2014 where she had perceived herself to have been scammed, and her later co-operation with _Harvey_. The juxtaposition of Ms Ng’s two positions; that she feared she was being scammed by _Harvey_ in early-2014, and her co-operation with the same person in late-2015, notwithstanding her former experience, is a central issue in this case, and it would thus be _apropos_ to set out salient parts of this statement.

### Police statement recorded by ASP Ong on 8 December 2015

48     As with all her other statements, there was no issue pertaining to the voluntariness of this statement[^49]. Ms Ng had begun by introducing herself and relating her introduction to _Harvey_, who had described himself as an engineer based in the United States, ‘_about two to three years ago’_. She goes on to state:

> 3    In February 2014, while I was talking to Harvey, we had discussed about my financial liabilities. The next day he told me that he had sent a bag to my house. He mentioned that there was cash inside the bag, but did not mention how much cash was inside the bag, He said that he had sent the bag via a courier company. _Harvey told me that the contents in the bag were meant for me_.[^50]

> 4    A few days later, I received a call from a lady claiming to be from the courier company, She told me the bag was being stopped at the Kuala Lumpur airport, and needed money for the bag to be released to my house. **_I made a few payments to the said company. And later lodged a police report_** (_report number_) **_about the incident as I felt it was a scam_**.

> 5    Shortly after, I understand that Harvey had gone to Malaysia, to try to recover the bag that had been stopped in Malaysia.

> 6    Sometime in September 2015, Harvey asked me if I could help him open a bank account, to help his business associate in Malaysia. He did not tell me any details with regards(sic) to how the bank account would be used. **_I asked Harvey if the account would be used for illegal purposes. However, Harvey assured me that the account would only be used for legitimate purposes._** As I trusted Harvey then, I opened a HSBC savings account (_number ending 0_) in my name.

> 7    (_Accused describes arrangements already set out in the foregoing for allowing Harvey to operate the account_)

> 8    I **_do not know what the account was used for after that. Harvey would also not elaborate on what the account was being used for_**. (Accused describes mutual notification arrangements) I noted that there were withdrawals being made in Malaysia. Harvey would also notify me when large sums were going to be deposited in the said account, but did not elaborate much on the source of the money.

> …

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Commentary on Harvey’s role as represented in the statement as against suspicions aired in the chat logs.

49     I should add that this juncture that Ms Ng seemed to have cast “_the lady claiming to be from the courier company_” (whom she knew as “Cat”[^51]) as the individual perpetrating the bag scam, and _Harvey_ to be one taking remedial action to the extent of having “_gone to Malaysia, to try to recover the bag_”. The seized email logs would, nevertheless, show Ms Ng’s very active suspicions of the role of _Harvey_ **_himself_** as the principal scammer, to the extent of bemoaning that her predicament had arisen from misplaced trust in him and warning _Harvey_ to expect retribution for his crimes.

50     Ms Ng’s insistence that she had asked _Harvey_ if the account would be used for illegal purposes, and her belief in his words after being told that he intended no illegitimate purpose, would become the main thrust of her defence. Rather than a genuine belief, her position seemed more of studied indifference as discerned by her statement that “_I do not know what the account was used for after that. Harvey_ **_would also not elaborate_** _on what the account was being used for_.”

51     The accused’s acceptance of _Harvey_ not elaborating what the account was being used for would be somewhat **_incongruous_** not just with her communicated suspicions that he had scammed her in a previous occasion, but also her demonstrably persistent fixation to know what _Harvey_ had been doing in their chat logs, and his failing to respond in time to such queries notably being a recurrent aspect of their quarrels.

## Evidence of PW3 Inspector Rajiv Makalingam

52     Ms Ng would appear before Inspector Rajiv in January 2016 to answer for transactions relating to the **_UOB_** account she had opened. While there was a considerable amount of overlap and similarities in this statement and the previous statements in her rehashing of background facts, there were discrepancies between the statements, which would be appropriate to highlight.

### Police statement recorded by Inspector Rajiv on 12 January 2016

53     Ms Ng’s statement begins with an introduction of her family situation and her employment. The substantive part of her statement begins with the second paragraph. The salient parts are set out in the following text fragments.[^52]

> 2    Sometime in the first week of January 016 I received a call from an Investigation officer from Ang Mo Kio Police Division, who called to ask me if I was the owner of the UOB Bank account (number ending with 5). I informed him I was the owner of the account. The account was set up by me in late October or early November 2015… The UOB account I opened under my name was set up for Harvey a friend I met two years ago. Harvey is an American who does not live in Singapore. (_Accused explains she met Harvey two years ago and that they communicate by phone or Viber_)…**_I am not sure what Harvey do in_** **_Singapore_** **_when I met him two years ago_** but after that Harvey went back to the United States. (_accused goes on to explain modus operandi for all three accounts she opened for Harvey_).

> 3    I wish to state that after I opened the accounts I am not aware what the accounts are used for…I opened the accounts for him as I trusted him and when I asked him why he needed me to open the accounts for him during our phone calls, **_he told me to trust him and not question him._** He assured me that no harm will come to me… **_I wish to state that I am_** **_romantically involved_** **_with Harvey but I am not in an_** **_intimate relationship_** **_with him_**. We have been in contact so long that I did not see a need to doubt his intentions when he asked me to open the bank accounts for him. Harvey also told me that the accounts I opened for him are for a friend of his whom I never me personally or chatted with over phone or text.

> …

> (_the remainder of the statement comprises_ (inter alia) _questions about the specifics regarding the (presumably false) identities and particulars of persons named in the scams, as well as the factual situations, concerning the UOB transactions, whom and where the accused professed to know nothing of_)

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Commentary on the statement’s inconsistencies with previous statements

54     Several incongruities emerged in the statement recorded before ASP Ong. One glaring inconsistency was Ms Ng seeming to state that she had met _Harvey_ in Singapore, where her previous statement had indicated that their entire history of face-to-face encounters had been on “_one or two_” occasions in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Even more peculiar would be Ms Ng’s ‘upgrading’ of their relationship from her statement to ASP Seet that “_we are_ **_not in a relationship_** _but just friends who are on very good terms_” in November 2015 to “_I wish to state that I_ **_am romantically involved_** _with Harvey but I am not in an intimate relationship with him_” here, just two months later.

55     The difference in Ms Ng’s latter-day candour might well have come from the accused’s realisation that any further denials of her romantic attachment to Harvey would be pointless given that the nature and extent of her relationship with Harvey would be all too evident from a study of the chats and email messages that the investigation had secured.

### Uncertainty as to whether the alleged physical meeting had taken place in Singapore or Kuala Lumpur

56     With regard to Ms Ng’s latter claim of not being in an “_intimate relationship_” with _Harvey_, I would observe that the investigation did not uncover what had transpired at the time of the purported physical meetings, with Ms Ng’s murky accounts being uncertain, at this point, as to whether the person-to-person encounters had been in Kuala Lumpur or Singapore, it remained settled that Ms Ng and _Harvey_ had not met physically during the time the alleged offences for the proceeded charges had been committed. This was of course not an uncommon scenario for ‘_love scam_’ cases. This statement was, however, **_not_** Ms Ng’s final iteration of her accounts of personal meetings with _Harvey_.

57     It should be noted that Ms Ng would later recant her assertion of having met _Harvey_ in Kuala Lumpur in two further statements which were recorded in February 2017[^53] and August 2017[^54], which again contradicted each other. My purpose for setting out the various statements in chronological order in these grounds is to show the **_evolving_** nature of Ms Ng’s evidence, where an assertion of facts made in a tone of ostensible certitude could be **_‘rolled back’_** and denied in a subsequent police statement.

### Accused never explains why she would trust Harvey as to open an account for the benefit of a purported third-party she had never met

58     Ms Ng made the dubious contention that “_(w)e have been in contact so long that_ **_I did not see a need to doubt his intentions_** _when he asked me to open the bank accounts for him. Harvey also told me that the accounts I opened for him are for a friend of his whom I never me personally or chatted with over phone or text_”. The aforementioned chat and message logs would make her claims for such a foundation of trust to be unconvincing. Given the history of the accused’s pervasive suspicion of _Harvey_ having defrauded her, as amply documented in the seized chats and emails, it simply beggared belief that Ms Ng had simply placed unthinking trust on _Harvey_ when “_he told me to trust him and not question him_”, particularly when they were made for the benefit of a third-party whom she had neither known nor met.

## Evidence of PW5 ASP Alan Tan

59     ASP Tan was the final witness proffered by the prosecution and recorded no fewer than five separate statements[^55] from Ms Ng between February and August 2017. While the statements also concern alleged offences beyond November 2015, these statements recorded before ASP Tan, as a composite, represent the most contemporaneous positions taken by Ms Ng, before she gave evidence herself at her trial.

### History of separate dealings with ‘Andy Clayton’ and ‘Harvey Hardman’ which lad to police reports against both, and referenced in subsequent statement recorded by ASP Alan Tan

60     After Inspector Rajiv, ASP Alan Tan subsequently recorded the next report in February 2017, this report is especially significant as it included a detailed account of the accused’s dealings with _Andy Clayton_, who had allegedly defrauded her and also another reiteration of her dealings with _Harvey_ which led to a police report being filed in 2014. This thus allowed a juxtaposition which demonstrated the similarity in modus operandi, and thus begged the question why Ms Ng would have continued to trust Harvey. In respect of the former, Ms Ng states[^56]:

> **_In October 2013, I got to know an online friend, Andy Clayton through a B2 site (online dating site). He introduced himself as a project manager_** in the field of petrol chemical (_sic_) and works on an oil rig in Sir(_sic_) Lanka.

> About 2-3 weeks later, he approached me for financial help to procure equipment for his project as he was unable to access his monies in his bank account as he had no internet connectivity in the oil rig. Though he did not promise any returns for my loans, I proceeded to make a total of 4 overseas remittances amounting to USD $31 687.63 to him between the period of 8 Oct 2013 to 3 Dec 3013. **_After I made the last transaction, I could no longer contact him for the return of my loans._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

61     In relation to her dealings with _Harvey_, I will set out just her direct dealings with him as basis for comparison, as her interactions with _Cat_, _Harvey’s_ intermediary, have been already set out in the foregoing. Ironically, the accused had confided her problems in _Harvey_, while seeming to be oblivious to their similarities in profile and had taken him at face value that he would be giving her money, as opposed to _Andy Clayton_ having taken sums from her. In the statement, Ms Ng stated[^57]:

> **_In February 2014, I got to know an online friend, Harvey Hardman through a B2 site. He introduced himself as a subcontractor with Exxon-Mobil_**. At the start of our communication, I mentioned to him about what transpired between Andy and me. **_I cautioned him that if her intended to cheat my money out of our relationship, I would put a stop to it_**. He mentioned that he would be giving me money instead. As such we continued our relationship via emails and phone call, and subsequently through Viber.

> About a week later, he told me that he was coming back to the mainland to run some errands after being stationed offshore for his work, **_He requested for my mailing address and told me he would be sending a present, without disclosing any details_**

> About 3-4 days later, I received a call from Cat from Coast-to-Coast Delivery Limited (KL Malaysia) that a luggage containing USD 300 000 with Harvey as the sender (_Cat asks for monies to clear delivery charges from KLIA to her residence_). I was reluctant to do so and I requested her to send it back to Harvey. **_However, Harvey told me it would be a one-off payment and assured that there would not be other subsequent payments involved_**.

> _(Cat requests further payments for various charges for trumped up fees and certificates between 7-28 February 2014, payments, payments are for the benefit of a “Lenny Anak William Haig”.)…_ but the luggage was never delivered to me. **_Thinking I have been scammed, I made a police report on 4 Mar 2014._** In total. I lost USD $42 800. I continued to remain in contact for more than a year with Harvey with the hope that the luggage would be delivered to me.

> _\[Emphasis added, words in parenthesis are a paraphrased abbreviation of the narrated account\]_

62     Ms Ng went on to give the latest iteration for her opening of the bank accounts, with the inception date being a day in “_July or August 2015_”, when _Harvey_ had requested help on behalf of a friend, but this time stating that the “_friend was a foreigner in Malaysia_”, and “_was unable to open a bank account in Malaysia but need_(ed) _a bank account to receive funds for his legitimate business_”.[^58]

### Accused’s continuation to assist in transactions using her DBS/POSB account after her other accounts had been frozen

63     In the statement recorded before ASP Tan, Ms Ng indicated that she had continued to assist Harvey well after the closure of her OCBC, HSBC and UOB accounts. She elaborated on these transactions, stating[^59]:

> **_After my OCBC, UOB and HSBC bank accounts were frozen and being investigated by the Police_**, my DBS Bank (account ending 1) was also used by Harvey to receive monies from unknown sources.

> The 1st transaction were 3 deposits (received on 6 November 2016 and 11 Nov 2016) amounting to $29 000. (_the amount was transferred into another person’s POSB account_).

> The 2nd transaction were 2 deposits (received on 10 Jan 2017) amounting to $4000 (_the amount was transferred into another person’s CIMB account_).

> The 3rd transaction were(_sic_) 1 deposit (received on 23 Jan 2017) amounting to $1 500 (_the amount was transferred via Western Union to into another person_).

> The 3rd transaction were(_sic_) 1 deposit (received on 24 Jan 2017) amounting to $50 021.25 (_the amount of $50 000 was transferred into another person’s UOB account_).

### Accused’s motivation for continuing to help Harvey despite knowing she would be ‘committing more offences in the process’

64     While these transactions were distinct from those from the charges she faced at trial (other charges had been presented but these had been stood down while the trial for the four proceeded charges was undertaken), they nevertheless offer an insight to the accused’s state of mind contemporaneous to when the statement had been recorded (in February 2017). By this time, Ms Ng had rationalised that her primary motive was to pursue the recovery of the monies she had expended from the recovery of the promises USD $300 000 he purportedly sent her. While this would appear to objective observers to be a hazardous and Quixotic “_chasing of losses_” in a quest for the bag of US denominated bills conjured by Harvey, Ms Ng seemed earnest that the bag and its promised contents was real and attainable, **_if_** she continued to perform _Harvey’s_ bidding. It should also be noted that Ms Ng explicitly acknowledged that her actions were wrong and amounted to criminal offences. This was quite evident in her answers to ASP Tan in the latter part of the statement, when responded as follows[^60]:

> Q:    Despite being investigated by CAD and various SPF land divisions for the unknown transfers that were deposited into your different bank accounts, why did you still assist to transfer the monies to Harvey as instructed?

> A:     **_My bottom line was to recoup the losses that I have incurred in my scam with Harvey._** I had continued to maintain my relationship with him with him and helped him to carry out his transfers was in the hope that I would receive the luggage that contained the USD 300 000.

> Q:    Given that your OCBC, OUB and HSBC bank accounts were frozen for police investigations, why did you continue to help Harvey receive monies in your DBS account and subsequently transfer them out when you clearly knew you would be committing more offences in the process?

> A:    Harvey gave me hope that I would be able to receive the luggage that contained the USD 300 000 if I helped him with the 1st transaction**_. I had pleaded with him not to use my DBS account to receive monies that were not mine but he continued to do so until I gave him the ultimatum of withholding whatever monies that he would send me after the 4th transaction_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Commentary on accused’s aversion to using her own DBS/POSB account to receive monies

65     Ms Ng had concluded the segment of the statement with an equivocal response to the question “_Did it cross your mind if the monies that you received were by illegal means?_” by stating that “_Harvey always assured me that he would not get me into trouble_”[^61]. Notwithstanding this, it was quite telling from her earlier answer that she had a profound **_aversion_** to the notion of Harvey making use of her own DBS account as a depository of funds from ‘unknown’ parties, strongly pointing to her knowledge, or at least strong suspicion of their illicit nature. It was also evident that Ms Ng was not a complete ‘pushover’ to invariably yielding to Harvey’s will and had the gumption to impose pressure tactics of her own when _in extremis_, as she was able to threaten Harvey with the withholding of monies paid into the account to deter him after the fourth transaction. Her responses thus firstly; showed at least implicit awareness that she was involved in illegal activities, and secondly; that her volition and freedom of action had not been completely suborned by any psychological influence Harvey exercised on her.

### Accused destroyed statements of account from OCBC, HSBC and UOB without reading them, but not the statements from her POSB account

66     This differentiation was also evident in the manner she had dealt with OCBC, HSBC and UOB statements of account, as distinct from her treatment of statements going to “her own” account. In a subsequent report recorded on 3 March 2017, also before ASP Alan Tan, Ms Ng stated that she had destroyed statements of account from OCBC, HSBC and UOB without reading them, but not the statements from her POSB account[^62]. The preceding answer is also included as her response seemed to be a tacit admission that she had no basis to believe _Harvey_ any longer.

> (_Question is despite being investigated by CAD and various land divisions for the suspect transactions in her different accounts_, “why do you choose to believe _Harvey_”?)

> A:     **_I am only interested in recouping my losses_** that I had paid to receive the luggage that contained USD 3000, 000.

> Q:    Did you receive the statements of account of HSBC, POSB, OCBC and UOB?

> A:    Yes, I did not read the statement of account of HSBC. OCBC, and OUB as the monies within did not belong to me and therefore **_I do not care about its_** (_sic_) **_transactions and balances_**. However, I do read my POSB statement of account.

> (_Question is whether accused had read the statements of account of the various banks after being called up for investigations_)

> A:     **_No, I will tear up and destroy the statements of account from HSBC, OCBC and OUB without reading them_**. I will tear up and thrown away my POSB after reading it though.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The accused’s final statements contradict her earlier ones, laying considerable doubt as to whether she ever met Harvey in person

67     It was before ASP Alan Tan in her 27 February 2017 statement that Ms Ng made the most surprising revelation that she had **_never_** met _Harvey_ in person, adding yet another dimension on the enigma as to what had ever transpired between the two. This occurred when ASP Tan asked[^63]:

> Q:    Have you met Harvey in person

> A:     **_No, I have only seen him over skype[^64]_**.

> {Emphasis added\]

68     This position was again changed when she recorded another statement before ASP Tan on 14 August 2017, when ASP had sought to clarify this apparent contradiction with the statement made before ASP Seet on 23 November 2015[^65]:

> Q:    (Accused is asked if she had indeed met Harvey in Kuala Lumpur as indicated in per previous statement)

> A:     **_I did not meet him in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as I did not travel overseas during the period of 2014 or 2015_**.

> Q:    Why did you mention in your statement that you have net Harvey in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia when you did not do so?

> A:     **_I was in a state of confusion as I was involved in a ‘love scam’ with Andy in 2013 and was followed in my communication with Harvey in 2014. I could have confused myself that I said I met him in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

69     After this surprising assertion that she had inadvertently recalled an encounter with _Andy;_ the perpetrator of the previous love scam, with one involving _Harvey_, Ms Ng then asserted that she had indeed met _Harvey_ in person, in Changi Airport “_for a brief encounter for about 5-10 minutes_” allowing for “_a very short chat with him before he flew off to another location as he was on transit_”.[^66] When queried the accused on her ability to recognise him in a crowd of passengers, Ms Ng purported to be able to recognise Harvey from an image of he had attached in an email of 23 January 2014.

### Accused’s vacillations about her encounter with Harvey in her 14 August 2017 statement

70     When ASP Tan had challenged her that she had failed to reference the meeting in Changi Airport in her previous statement[^67] and had only mentioned a _Skype_ meeting, Ms Ng had first pivoted to state that she had **_both_** met _Harvey_ physically in Changi and seen him on a _Skype_ chat. She then began to vacillate, first stating that she could not recall having met Harvey in person first, or if she had communicated with _Harvey_ first via _Skype_. Ms Ng then performed a surprising about turn to state that she could **_not_** even **_confirm_** that the ‘_Harvey_’ whom she had met was the same person she had seen in her _Skype_ chat[^68]:

> Q:    Why did you inform me that you only met Harvey over SKYPE during your statement dated 24 February (reference to Q31) and omitted the fact that (sic) actually met him in person at the Changi Airport?

> A:     **_I confirmed_** **_that I met Harvey in person and chat with him over SKYPE once or twice and he is the exact person I have met and communicated with during that period_**, I did not intentionally hide the fact that I have met him in person as I could not recall whether I would have met him in person first, or on SKYPE.

> Q:    Can you confirm that the person that you have met in person or seen over SKYPE and the person who you are communicating with are the same person? Can you verify the identity of Harvey with the person you met or communicated?

> A:     **_I_** **_cannot confirm_** **_this fact if they are the same person. I also did not match his identification to his face or photo before_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### A catalogue of inconsistencies by the accused about her dealings with Harvey

71     Again, Ms Ng’s affirmative reiteration that she had met Harvey, followed by her surprising concession that she was not even certain that the person she had met at Changi Airport were enormously **_consequential_**. This was given Ms Ng’s case at trial that _Harvey_ had been the central figure in her descent into criminality, having insidiously influenced her to open the various accounts over a prolonged period (although I am mindful that the proceeded charges only concern accounts opened, and used, in the second half of 2015). Ms Ng’s constantly shifting positions are set out below, and simply do not add up:

> \-    Ms Ng contended that her impression of her meeting with _Harvey_ had been so weak that she mistook a prior meeting with _Andy Clayton_ in **_Kuala Lumpur_** with one that involved _Harvey but_ had been so certain as to state this in her statement to ASP Seet recorded on 23 November 2015[^69]. It should also be noted that Ms Ng had at cross examination[^70] changed her position again by stating that she had **_never_** met _Andy Clayton_ face-to-face in the entirety of their five month relationship.

> \-    Ms Ng had made a reference to meeting Harvey in **_Changi Airport_**, when it was pointed out to her that she had made a reference to having seen Harvey in **_Singapore_** in a previous statement[^71] recorded on 12 January 2016 before Inspector Rajiv.

> \-    Ms Ng was next challenged about her stating that she had **_never_** met Harvey in person to ASP Alan Tan himself in a previous statement[^72] on 24 February 2017. Ms Ng had two positions on this occasion, with her initial position was that she had _both_ had meetings via _Skype_ and met _Harvey_ at Changi airport, but curiously could not recall which had come first. The accused had hinted to her using photographic images that _Harvey_ had attached in an email in early 2014.

> \-    The accused then settled on a final position that she could not be certain that the person she had allegedly met at Changi Airport had been _Harvey_ and had not even bothered to check the person’s appearance against the images that ‘_Harvey_’ had sent.

72     Given Ms Ng’s latter intimation that she was ‘**_romantically involved_**’[^73] with _Harvey_ and that she had feelings for him, albeit that they were not in an intimate relationship, it simply did not make sense that she would make mistakes of this nature. The mistaking of encounters with one of _Andy Clayton_ being substituted as a meeting with _Harvey_ was especially suspicious, as romantic reminiscences are usually deeply encoded as a memory. The substitution of a romantic partner in such memories would seem highly improbable. By the same token, the short ‘_whistle stop_’ meeting at Changi airport appeared artificial by its lack of specifics. There had been no elaboration of how the two, who had hitherto never seen each other and had only a narrow sliver of time within the claimed transit period, would liaise to meet in the often-teeming crowds in one of the world’s busiest airports. Ms Ng’s admission that she could not be certain the man she met was the _Harvey_ she corresponded with, and that she had not checked against the images this _Harvey_ had sent, simply added to a scenario which was both surreal and improbable.

### What were the accused’s motivations?

73     Ultimately, it was the prosecution’s case that Ms Ng had been principally motivated by the gain promised by _Harvey_ when he dangled the prospect of a bag laden with US$300 000 bills, which he had purportedly sent to her. My sense is that there was at least on the outset; in early 2014, a romantic connection between the two, as evidenced by the endearments exchanged in the messages and email. In my view, attitudes had hardened by the time of the transactions forming the proceeded charges, Ms Ng had been predominantly concerned to recover the ever-elusive bag and recoup her losses from the imaginary fees conjured by _Cat_ and/or _Harvey_ which she had paid. In her desperation to meet these payments, Ms Ng had even borrowed from moneylenders. This view would cohere with the accused’s own answer in the same statement[^74]:

> Q:    Given that you have been scammed by Andy for more than SGD 30 000 in the first incident, why did you choose o believe that Harvey was not scamming you?

> A:    I was tempted by Harvey’s offer to recover my losses and if it turned out to be true too his claim, I would also be able to obtain the (_sic_) SGD 300 000 extra in cash

> …

> Q:    After all these communications with that you had with Harvey, would you consider that you are in a relationship with him?

> A:    I had thought it would develop into a relationship, but it never materialised. As time dragged on, I became immune to his excuses and treatment. I am only interested in getting my losses back as long as I listened to his instructions to receive and handle the monies that he wanted me to do with.

##### DEFENCE CASE

### Evidence of DW1, Ng Siew Wai Carole

74     After the prosecution had closed its case, learned counsel did not propose to make a submission of no case. As I was satisfied that prosecution had discharged its burden of establishing a _prima facie_ case, I administered the allocution to Ms Ng, who elected to give evidence in her own defence, as the sole defence witness.

75     As a starting point, I would find her handwritten defence stated in her cautioned statement in response to the first charge[^75], which was recorded on 27 February 2018 before ASP Alan Tan, to be an apt encapsulation of her position in at trial:

> I am not guilty of the charges and have no knowledge that the monies were deposited /transferred to my bank accounts were stolen properties or laundered monies. **_I have no reason to believe that they were stolen as I am a victim myself and have been cheated by Harvey Hardman._**

> To conclude, I do not benefit from any of the transaction (_sic_) and my intention is to recover the monies that I have paid in initially.

> \[Emphasis added\]

76     As Ms Ng had been interviewed by no fewer than five investigation officers, on ten separate occasions, an integral part of her court testimony was a bid to reconcile discrepancies described in the foregoing, with a view to resolving uncertain aspects of her evidence. The two especially enigmatic aspects of Ms Ng’s case which Ms Ng’s defence would have to address would be:

> Firstly, the fact that she had been previously cheated by _Adam Clayton_ whom she had met prior to meeting _Harvey_ in the same site, with the latter even claiming to be from the same company: Exxon Mobil.

> Secondly, Ms Ng having filed a police report against _Harvey_ in early 2014 which predated her becoming an accessory to facilitate his access of the former’s ill-gotten gains in late 2015 (for the proceeded charges). This is not to mention the extensive document trial where she had accused him of scamming her, and where she had in an angst filled exchange, even hinted at **_suicide_** as her life had been ‘ruined’ by the debts incurred.

### Precis of accused’s reason for continuing to cooperate with Harvey despite her police report against him

77     Ms Ng’s answer was simply that she had been reassured and revised her adverse view of _Harvey_ after he had convinced her that there was no scam involved in his promised bag containing US $300 000 in bills. While there are many iterations of this belief in her testimony, the following passage from her cross-examination would best express her position[^76]:

> Okay. Let me explain why I say that. Now, at that point …I found that it’s a scam because too much money are being involved, and I actually don’t get to see the bag eventually. And I also wanted to protect myself. But … when I have clarified this report was filed …before my clarification with Harvey. **_And he told me, it’s not a scam. He would not get me into trouble. That’s the reason why when I first felt that it’s a scam because of all these money paid, but subsequently, Harvey told me that no, this is not---he would not do …any harm, therefore I went ahead to do whatever I have done_**.

> \[Emphasis added. pauses and repeated words have been edited for flow and readability\]

## A consideration of the text and email messages which predated the offences for the proceeded charges

78     I found Ms Ng’s aforementioned claim to be implausible, for reasons that will be set out in the latter part of these grounds. For this part, I will be setting out and discussing the evidence in three parts to demonstrate that the accused **_could not_** have had any reason to trust _Harvey_ again after being defrauded by the latter’s promises to give her a bag of US denominated bills worth US $300 000. Not least in support for this proposition would be Ms Ng herself calling out _Harvey_ as a scammer in her series of emails. For the next part, I will show that there was a repairing of their relationship in late-2014 to early 2015, and that this had likely made it possible to co-opt Ms Ng to assist in opening the OCBC, HSBC and OUB accounts in succession and providing the ATM cards and other facilitation tokens to enable _Harvey_ to operate the accounts. For the final part of this section, I will set out Ms Ng’s own testimony suggesting that her co-option by _Harvey_ was so **_complete_** that she would **_lie_** to an investigation officer that she had been involved in a bridal services business.

### The accused would have had no reason to trust Harvey ever again after being defrauded in the 2014 parcel scam

79     Ms Ng’s case was that _Harvey_ had accomplished her reconsideration to co-operate with him again by verbal blandishments that he was not a criminal and would not get her into trouble or harm. This sanguine characterisation stood in stark contrast to the vituperative exchanges in the text and email messages exhibited in the statement of agreed facts. A proper contextual analysis to compare and contrast the respective positions between the one expressed in 2018-2019 (as in her conditioned statement and court testimony), and her state of mind during the relevant periods in 2014-2015 would be apposite. A study of her email messages would show Ms Ng expressing herself romantically to Harvey[^77], even as he had already, in a message 16 February 2014 begun exploiting her in proposing the illusory US $300 000 in a bag as “_funds to settle_ (her) _liabilities_’ created by _Andy Clayton’s_ fraudulent acts). For reference, this is a fragment exhibited in the Statement of Agreed Facts, where Ms Ng writes[^78].

> Hi, darling.

> If you have noticed lately, we have not been talking like the way we used to. While I appreciate your kindness for giving me the funds to settle my liabilities, It has been kind of painful. Our daily conversation (_sic_) are nothing except looking for funds to settle the fine.

> I really cherished the good old times and looking forward to more.

> Sent from my Windows phone”.

80     Things take a darker turn at the next message on 17 March 2014 at 11.13 am, when Ms Ng writes; “**_I’m not sure what had happened - have my fears been confirmed? Why are you not taking or calling me?_**” Ms Ng indicated that she had been distressed about Harvey’s conduct after “giving out so much money” to Harvey on the trumped-up administrative fees and charges for the elusive bag of money. She added that “_every time I asked him what is the outcome, he keep giving me reasons. And at times, he ignore my calls or my mails went unanswered_”.[^79]

81     This was followed up by a further message on the same day, at 3:17pm, when Ms Ng asks to _Harvey_. “**_Why do you make me go deeper into debts, if all these are frauds… “I’m very lost and miserable_**” and ending with a plaintive “**_WHY WHY WHY_**” Ms Ng explained the message had been to signal her desperation as she had borrowed from her sister to obtain funds to pay the series of charges in her bid to obtain the bag of money. She had resorted to borrowing from her sister. In her court testimony, Ms Ng had admitted that these queries were a recurrent feature of their phone conversations, and stating had _Harvey_ had repeatedly glossed over her concerns with vague verbal assurances[^80]:

> …So, it’s like, I keep on getting into all this and I have couple of times over the co---phone conversation, **_I have asked him, “Are you telling me the truth or are you cheating me of my money?”_** But each time he told me, why do I have to think … of this in this way. And I need to repay my sister, so …that’s the reason why I put, “I am very lost and miserable. Why Why Why” is referring, “Why are you doing this to me?”.

82     Ms Ng’s next email on 13 April 2014, showed her mounting anxiety, and ends with an implicit threat of self-harm:

> You have been ignoring my calls or even calling me for the last 2 days (Friday, Saturday). **_Maybe this is after all a scam. You have the intention to cheat me from day 1._** Why do you persist to get even the last USD1,500 from me as you know I do not have any more money and this amount can be raised is through borrowing from my colleague and at current standing is $8,500 (USD 6,500). I do not know how to repay this loan. On top of this, I have also outstanding loan of close to $50,000, (USD 40,000). All these have been given to your accomplices for the so-called fines/certificates. I have made this known to you since day 1 when we know each other that I cannot afford to make any mistakes and I’m still drawn to it. This will be my final time as I do not have any more chances to make errors again. **_This time I have to pay with my life. Owing moneylender is not a laughing matter_** and there is no way out for me to pay the outstanding of $10,500 on Tuesday. If you happen to call and there’s no reply, you should know why.

> \[Emphasis added\]

83     Ms Ng’s next email, sent on the 14 April 2014, carried an increasingly ominous tone of debt, planned suicide and retribution:

> I am convinced this is a fraud and scam. Why do you have to do this (_sic_) me? Becos of all this, I’m now penniless and heavily in debt. **_Remember someone is watching you above and there will be retribution_**… **_Because of your doing, there is one less person living in this world and 2 innocent kids robbed of their mother_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The emails show a strong conviction on the part of Ms Ng that she had been defrauded

84     The point that ought be evident in this series of emails, which occur around the time of Ms Ng’s police report against _Harvey_ in March 2014, demonstrate a rather **_vehement_** conviction on the part of the accused that she had been scammed by _Harvey_, and vividly show Harvey’s hold over her at the time, having convinced her to borrow from her sister and even a moneylender to make payments for the battery of invented charges and fees to redeem a fictitious bag of cash, which was of course a classical ‘**_parcel scam’_**. To end off this section, this is final email message, which was sent on 18 August 2014 to _Harvey_. Ms Ng had claimed that she had sought ‘_closure_’ to the relationship, as she had been exhausted as her mails or calls to him had gone unanswered and she had lost hope that she would ever see the promised US denominated bills in the bag, or even be reimbursed for her fees. The final message states[^81]:

> This may be the last time that I will write to you since you are no longer interested anymore,

> I am unable to find a satisfied reason for myself why you are not taking my calls or even calling me back. I am greatly affected by your actions and this is affecting my work too. I need this job to pay off my loans etc **_unless I decide to end my life with no more worries…_**

> You promised to remit money to me when you return to the US and it’s more than a month since you are back, until now I have not gotten anything. When you needed money, I have to almost get to you immediate and where I am concerned, I am left to fend for myself. I have no one to turn to get any more funds.

> **_Now, I’m beginning to ask myself if the bag, etc, is true. You have not given me the details of the custom guy and the baggage combination_** and every time the same excuse you gave me is, “I will send”. **_Please do not let this drag anymore and if this whole saga is a scam, have the guts to tell me directly_**. I am a direct person and I will tell you the likes or dislikes, so likewise if you are direct, frank, and open, tell me truly.

> I’m really, really stressed and stretched. All I’m asking from you now is the TRUE (_sic_). I am not going to repeat what I have to say before. Return at least the 70,000 (being payment for all the s\*\*t like certificates/etc). I believe whatever one do, there is always retribution and the event of death, I will H\*\*\*\*[^82] you..

> \[Emphasis added\]

85     What ought be noted from the foregoing would be that Ms Ng was capable of analysing the veracity of Harvey’s claim, and had noted the unseeming delays, perpetual excuses and paucity of details of the bag, and the course of its passage. She had at this juncture, apparently concluded that Harvey’s purported gift was a bluff. Given this, it would have been, in my view, been hard to conceive that she could have reposed “_reasonable grounds to believe_” that the transactions in the OCBC, HSBC, UOB and her own DBS/POSB accounts were not illegal, within the objective test set out in the case of _Ang Jeanette v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGHC 100</span>, <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1</span>. This aspect will be covered in greater detail in these grounds.

### There had been a rapprochement between the accused and Harvey shortly before she began to open the accounts in OCBC and HSBC

86     There was indeed a rapprochement of sorts in the seized messages which covered a period of 27 April 2015 to June 2017. There were exchanges of terms of endearment such as _‘my love’_ and ‘_babe_’, but also a considerable number of disagreements, which occurred frequently when Harvey failed to respond to her. Ms Ng, as previously observed, could hold her own, as could be seen by her admonishing Harvey that “I _am a woman from SINGAPORE. Not a yes woman from dunno where_” in a message on 12 June 2015. The topics of discussion were predominantly minutiae of their daily separately lived lives and the progress of the relationship, with occasional smatterings of particulars over the opening of accounts, where the topics were invariably initiated by _Harvey_. As mentioned earlier, no details of any bridal business were discussed. The messages which were of interest were the last ones found in the copious compilation.

### The accused’s last messages in mid-2017 betrayed her knowledge, or at least ‘gut feel’ that Harvey’s bag of cash had been a ‘myth’ and scam all along

87     The messages which bore especial significance were Ms Ng’s final remarks over the chat as the investigation progressed to its advanced stages in the middle of 2017. Ms Ng’s last three messages were[^83]

> 28 May 2017-**_Y do you create this myth abt the bag to get me into trouble with the law?_**

> 31 May 2017- So my gut feel is CORRECT

> 10 June 2017-After all these u hv done to me YOU WILL GET YOUR Retribution.

88     To be clear these messages appeared to be spontaneous expressions by Ms Ng and had not be preceded by any revelation or sudden intimation by _Harvey_ that he had perpetrated any fraud on her, and would thus stand as an unequivocal acknowledgement that the issue of the bag’s authenticity had **_never been settled_** between the time she had reconciled with _Harvey_ in April 2015 and these final messages in May-June 2017. This being the case, she would have embarked on the opening of the bank accounts and other acts of assistance in mid-late 2015 with knowledge, or at the least, a “_gut feel_” that she was rendering unquestioning assistance to a scammer. Given this, it would be difficult for Ms Ng to uphold her defence that “_I have no reason to believe that_ (the monies in the accounts) _were stolen as I am a victim myself”_ as stated in the first of her conditioned statements[^84].

### At trial, accused pivoted away from original position that accounts were opened for her bridal business with Harvey and admitted other details in her initial statement recorded before Officer Liew on 6 October 2015 were not true.

89     In her examination-in-chief, Ms Ng eschewed all references of the accounts being opened for her participation in a bridal business with _Harvey_, only maintaining that _Harvey_ had cited a friend needing such accounts to be opened. Ms Ng’s abandonment of this narrative was established by the learned DPP when she confirmed her **_negative_** answer to the learned DPP’s question of whether she had in fact run a wedding planning business with _Harvey_.[^85] She had added that her own suspicions had been engaged she would not expect the amounts coming into the account to be “_so huge_” if the business enterprise involved wedding planning[^86].

90     Ms Ng confessed to caring little what the _Harvey_ proposed to do with any proposed businesses or any other arrangements involving the accounts, so long as she was able to “_generate profits to redeem the bag_”[^87]

> Q    Now, Mdm. Ng, as far as you’re concerned, at all points in time when you were carrying out the instructions of Mr. Harvey to your mind, you believed that it was for a wedding planning business?

> A     **_Not exactly wedding business but into business to generate profits to redeem the bag, so that I would be given back my losses. As I said, if I’m lucky, I would have the cash_** but I have made known to Harvey that … I only want my losses to be returned to me. That’s all.

> Q    … You have told (_the court and police_) consistently that it was for what you believed to be a wedding planning business?

> A    Yup.

> Q    Now, today, you are telling the Court that, in fact, you **_don’t know whether it’s for a wedding planning business_** and it was just, to the best of your knowledge, **_a general business_**, is that right?

> A    Yes.

> \[Emphasis added\]

91     Ms Ng had also conceded to just following _Harvey’s_ instructions to obtain funds to set up this unspecified business, giving this rather obliquely framed response to the DPP’s question[^88]:

> Because that was what being told by Harvey to me and to say that he needs the funds to set up the business, and hence, he explained to me that it’s going to be something like a wedding planner, and I go by it. Whatever I have mentioned here is just from what I have been told.

92     Thus, there appeared to be an active and gross misrepresentation in her statement to IO Liew, the above was a far cry from Ms Ng’s earlier assertion, in the 6 October 2015 statement, where the clear language showed her being **_directly involved_** with Harvey in the bridal service enterprise, particularly where she had told the police that:

> A2    I opened the bank account for **_my small business purpose_**, **_I operated a service to organise wedding functions in Singapore and Malaysia._** I shared this small business with my business partner in Malaysia (ie _Harvey_) …

> A3    I do not know how the bank account had been misused as the bank account number will be given to clients who wanted to engage my company service. **_Harvey and I only provide this wedding service arrangement and organising to friends_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

### The accused’s misrepresentations that she was the only person holding the ATM and other access facilities to the account

93     Further probing questions by the learned DPP eventually led to an even more consequential admission that the accused had essentially been untruthful in her assertions that **_she_** **_alone_** had held the ATM cards and access devices linked to the accounts, suggesting they were not available to _Harvey_. She had stated:

> Harvey does not have any access to my bank account. I am the only one who held on to the ATM card and ibanking rights.

94     This seemed a bare attempt to divert the finger of suspicion away from _Harvey_, along with the notion that her putative business enterprise whom she specifically told police to be ‘_organising wedding functions in Singapore and Malaysia_’ was involved in any fraudulent acts. In reality, Ms Ng had mailed the ATM cards to Harvey, despite being the nominal account holder.

95     Due to the accused’s tendency to chronologically waver in her testimony in testifying about state of knowledge at various different points of time without clearly stating so, the learned DPP carefully framed his question[^89]:

> Q    So, when you tell the police officer in 2015 that you are the only person using the OCBC bank account, **_this is very different from what you believed at that point in time. Isn’t that right?_**

> A     **_Yes_**.

96     After this concession, Ms Ng prevaricated to state that she had claimed to be the only person using the OCBC ATM card as she had planned to “_to check with Harvey what is going on_”[^90]. as this was the first time, she had been called up by the police to record a statement, which had all come as a shock to her. The DPP sought a reconfirmation of Ms Ng’s position, and she had acknowledged as follows[^91]:

> Q    Mdm. Ng, in summary, **_you lied to the police because you wanted to buy time_** to find out what was going on from Harvey, yes?

> A     **_Yes._**

97     Ms Ng’s claim that she lied to Officer Liew as she intended to check with _Harvey_ what was going on was in itself, a specious contention, as there was really no reason why she could not have been honest to say that _Harvey_ **_did_** hold the ATM cards in Malaysia, but that she did not understand the circumstances of the reported fraudulent acts and would revert after checking with _Harvey_. Instead, her response rings hollow, as she failed to offer any clarification when her next statement was recorded two months later, where she should have had the opportunity to touch base with _Harvey_ and offer his explanation to the investigation officer. Ms Ng had eschewed this opportunity to save herself, and unfortunately, to use a colloquial term, **_“doubled down”_** to again to say “_I did not make any withdrawals for Harvey and left the entire account to him to manage_.” These were patently false as Ms Ng had not just allowed Harvey to use the HSBC account, which remained open after the OCBC account had been frozen, but facilitated in withdrawing monies:[^92]

> … Previously, you told the Court that for the bank accounts, which you have opened for Harvey, **_you had actually helped Harvey by carrying out withdrawals and remittances of monies from those accounts_**, yes?

> A     **_Yes_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

98     Ms Ng admitted to having gone to the extent of lying to staff of the _Western Union_ remittance agency when she made her remittances, which had occurred when Harvey exceeded the withdrawal limit for the ATM cards she had suppled. Shed had lied that the monies to be remitted were just “_loans to friends_”[^93]. Ms Ng had taken the position and lied to assist _Harvey_ despite the latter never offering any proof that he was running a legitimate business[^94]:

> Q    Now, Harvey did not provide you with any proof whatsoever that he was using the account for a legitimate business, isn’t that correct?

> A    Yes.

> Q    He provided you with no documentation, no invoices, no supply records, no inventory records, absolutely nothing to back up his claim that the account was being used to carry out a legitimate business, isn’t that right?

> A    Yes.

> Q     **_And you are telling this Court that you decided to take him at face value?_**

> A     **_Yes._**

> Q    In fact, what you are telling in this Court **_is you decided to ignore what the investigation officer had told you and believed Harvey instead, yes?_**

> A     **_Yes._**

> \[Emphasis added\]

### Accused tentatively admits to covering up for Harvey

99     A particularly enigmatic part of the cross-examination was when Ms Ng responded with a reference to her “_trying to cover up for Harvey_”. This had occurred when the learned DPP had challenged her with certain identified discrepancies, as well as the incongruity of her having to tell the aforementioned lies just to buy time “_to check with Harvey_”. This is the salient fragment of the exchange[^95]:

> Q    So, it’s very puzzling that instead of you know, saying that, telling the truth. What we have here are multiple lies from you. Why?

> A     **_Maybe I’m trying to cover up for Harvey, I do not know. Subconsciously may I---maybe I’m trying to cover up._** And I see what is Harvey’s response. That was what I have in mind, that’s all.

> Q    That’s---that’s very interesting, Mdm. Ng. We are finally coming to the---well, a bit of the truth of the matter. You used the words “cover up”, isn’t that right? You want to cover up for Harvey. Now, when you say cover up for Harvey in general understanding. If I want to cover up something it means that something is wrong, isn’t it?

100    Ms Ng had adroitly shifted to say “_Maybe_…_I’m using the wrong phrase_”, and that “_Maybe for me is like I want to… find out the truth_”.[^96] She demurred “_That’s why I’ve said maybe I should not use the word_ “_cover up_”. **_But, in order for me to buy time, yes_**, **_I lied_** _or I should actually on the hindsight told Officer Liew that I need to check”._ The learned DPP had characterised this as a “_Freudian slip_” and that “_the truth reside_(d)’ in her initial spontaneous response.

101    I could not fault the DPP’s analysis, there had been no ambush, given that the DPP had been examining the accused (who was represented by competent and very experienced counsel) on the same area for a sustained period, and she had been given full amplitude to express herself, often giving prolix and rambling ‘_stream of consciousness_” responses. Ms Ng’s answer was freely given, and did not seem to be an out-of-place response, given the premises laid out by the learned DPP.

102    By the same token, the learned DPP has identified certain of Ms Ng’s statements, such as her assertion to be the sole person holding account access to the impugned accounts be “_Lucas lies_”, as discerned from principles derived from the case of Regina v Lucas (Ruth) <span class="citation">\[1981\] QB 720</span> at 724. A “_Lucas lie_” of course a deliberate statement which is proven to be untrue from independent evidence, where the motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. This aspect will be more closely analysis in the later part of these grounds.

## ANALYSIS

### Introduction

103    The evidence in this case has principally involved Ms Ng’s testimony and the document trail, including ten statements recorded between 6 October 2015[^97] and 25 August 2017[^98] created in the course of the investigation process. It would emerge from these statements that Ms Ng had apparently made more withdrawals **_after_** 2015, even as successive statements were recorded from her. It should also be clear that these alleged later acts (_post_\-2015) are **_not_** the business of these present proceedings. In assessing her _mens rea_ for the four proceeded charges, the analysis would be on what she knew, and what she could be extrapolated to have known at the time the offences were committed in mid-end 2015. The statements, taken as a whole, contribute to the assessment of Ms Ng’s veracity as the truth and accuracy of her accounts. The purpose of the granular assessment of the various statements in the preceding hundred paragraphs is to allow a considered appraisal of the various aspects of the evidence, and juxtaposing her testimony with the statements, along with the seized email and chats, in a case where chronology, context and consistency within the factual matrix played a critical role, in determining guilt. The following are an elaboration of my brief grounds for verdict[^99].

### Applicable standard for ‘reasonable grounds to believe’ as established by case law

104    As the other elements of the proceeded charges are not in dispute, the central issue here would be the _mens rea_ element of whether Ms Ng had, within the present factual milieu, reasonable grounds to believe that she was handling sums which were the proceedings of criminal activity. Before delving into a parsing of the factual matrix into this inquiry, it would be apposite to look again at the applicable standard recognized by case law expounding on the standard to be applied to determine if an accused individual had “_reasonable grounds to believe_”.

105    The standard is well established and can be encapsulated in the following passage from _Ang Jeanette v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 1</span>, where VK Rajah JA states at \[70\] “_Ang Jeanette_”:

> Before going into the facts revealed in the Appellant’s statements to the CAD that show that she had reasonable grounds to believe that the moneys she was dealing with were derived from criminal conduct, it would perhaps be useful, at this juncture, to reiterate briefly the local case law on the meaning of “reasonable grounds to believe”. In _Ow Yew Beng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 1 SLR(R) 536</span>, the High Court held (at \[10\]) that having “reason to believe” involved a “lesser degree of conviction than certainty but a higher one than speculation”. **_In applying the test, the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved (ie, including his knowledge and experience), but must reason (ie, infer from the facts known to such individual) from that position like an objective reasonable man_** (see _Koh Hak Boon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 733</span> at \[13\] and _PP_ v _Wang Ziyi Able_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 2 SLR(R) 61</span> at \[87\]).

> \[Emphasis added\]

106    The standard therefore has distinct subjective and objective elements, where the court in adjudication, must assume the position of the **_actual_** individual involved, where the inquiry also **_subjectively_** considers their knowledge and experience, The judge must, nevertheless, reason, which is the process of inferring or ‘_reasoning_’ from the facts known to such an individual from that position, in a manner that an **_objective_** reasonable person would. In the referenced case of _Koh Hak Boon_, the appellants had dealt with $450 000 gold ornaments taken from a robbery. Yong CJ held that the circumstances of the transaction, which included the large quantity of gold being offered at a steep under price, absence of documentation, and surreptitious manner of dealings to be sufficient to ascribe reasonable grounds for belief that the gold ornaments were stolen property, notwithstanding that none of the appellants were told that these ornaments were loot from a goldsmith robbery.

### Applying the binary subjective-objective standard

107    Turning now to the instant case, in respect of the first two charges under section 44, CDSA, Ms Ng stood accused of allowing Harvey to use two bank accounts in UOB and HSBC that she had purposefully opened, where she would have reasonable grounds to believe that the aforesaid Harvey was engaged in criminal conduct, and which facilitated Harvey’s access to these benefits of criminal conduct would be facilitated. The other two charges under section 47(3), CDSA are for assisting Harvey to receive deposits into a POSB bank account, which was opened by Ms Ng, despite having these same reasonable grounds to believe that the deposits in whole directly represented Harvey’s benefits from criminal conduct.

108    Simply put, the test of “_reason to believe_” is an objective test but conducted from a more subjective perspective of a person with the accused individual’s knowledge and experience. The test was therefore whether a person with Ms Ng’s **_subjective_** life experiences and knowledge would have been alerted to the level to having an **_objectively_** reasonable basis for belief that she was **_enabling_** (for the first two charges) or **_dealing_** (for the remaining brace of charges) with proceeds of criminal activities, which were of course the monies paid into the bank accounts,

### Considering the accused’s ‘knowledge and experience’

109    To recapitulate from _Ang Jeanette Ang_, to apply the test of “reasonable grounds to believe”, the court must assume the position of the actual individual involved (including their knowledge and experience), before reasoning from that position like an objective reasonable person It must be recalled that Ms Ng, as alluded to earlier, faced the court as a Singaporean at the stage of middle-life, who had been able to complete the upbringing of her two children to adulthood, despite the not inconsiderable interruption brought by a divorce. She also held consistent long-term employment with multinational corporations, working to assist and co-ordinate travel schedules for the most senior executives of her organisation. Incidentally, Ms Ng was fully aware of the concept of “**_money laundering_**” at the time she had filed her police report in March 2014, answering in the affirmative, when asked by the learned DPP[^100]. It would thus be puzzling that a person with her level of exposure would not have seen what prosecution referred to as the **_red flags[^101]_** in acceding to the demands imposed by _Harvey_.

### Accused herself raided red flags against Harvey in 2014

110    Indeed, **_Ms Ng was not incapable of raising red flags herself_**, as seen by her police report and chats, which have been set out in extension in the preceding part of these grounds, where she had made repeated allusions to Harvey being complicit in fraud or scam against her in past interactions. As was the case in _Koh Hak Boon_, where the circumstances were deemed suspicious in part because the transactions had occurred in a hotel room, and the fact that no one was introduced by name when the transactions took place, there were objectively suspicious circumstances in the manner of their association which ought have raised her suspicions when _Harvey_ had asked for her assistance.

### A chronological history of red flags

111    The prosecution has put a very substantial case that Ms Ng ought to have had a degree of knowledge and adverse experience with _Harvey_, as well as a previous encounters in a scam with a similar modus operandi which should have put her on her guard and found ‘reasonable grounds’ to believe the former was engaged in criminal conduct. This would include:

> (a)     Ms Ng having met _Harvey_ on the **_very same_** online social dating website she met one _Andy Clayton_, who had reportedly cheated her so severely, she had gone into debt.

> (b)     After her online association with _Harvey_, Ms Ng was asked to pay certain dubiously named administrative charges to redeem the “gift” from _Harvey_, of the bag of US denominated bill, which she, of course never received.

> (c)     On 4 March 2014, Ms Ng had summoned the gumption to file a police report against _Harvey_ and his associate whom she knew as “_Cat_” upon her suspicion that she had been cheated into paying “fees” to redeem _Harvey’s_ gift. Her basis was clear “**_As I feel this is a scam, I have decided to come to the police for assistance_**

> (d)     On various occasions in April 2014, Ms Ng had sent **_multiple_** emails to _Harvey_ accusing him of cheating her[^102]. The tone of the emails suggested that she had, to say the least, grave doubts about the legitimacy of dealings involving _Harvey_. Ms Ng had gone so far as demand of _Harvey_ why he made her go deeper into ‘_debts_’ if “_all these are frauds_” in an email dated 17 March 2014. The seized emails proved a trove for the prosecution, given Ms Ng’s successions of plaintive complaints to _Harvey_ being variations on this theme, including an email dated 13 April 2014, where Ms Ng had mused “_Maybe this is after all a scam_” and that his intention had been to cheat her ‘_from day 1_’ Ms Ng had taken an even stronger tone in her email dated 14 April 2014, where she had stated her conviction that she had been “_convinced this is a FRAUD and SCAM_” and mournfully queried _Harvey_ to ask “_Why do you have to do this to me_”.

112    When cross-examined about the police report she had filed against _Harvey_ and _Cat_, Ms Ng conceded that she had stated “_this is a scam_” in the police report, as she felt that both _Harvey_ and _Cat_ had cheated her and was candid about her distrust of Harvey at the time the report was made[^103].

Accused:

 | 

If you want an answer from me, it’s---then, it **_would be both. Because I have liaised with both parties_**.

 |
| 

DPP:

 | 

That’s correct, Mdm. Ng. In fact, when you filed this police report, **_you felt that both Harvey and ‘Cat’ have scammed you._** Isn’t that right?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

**_Yup._**

 |
| 

\[Emphasis added\]

 |

  
  

### Accused’s explanation for continuing relations with Harvey

113    Despite the abovementioned adverse interactions with _Harvey_ in 2014, Ms Ng’s exchanges with him, as evidenced by her chat messages commencing from April 2015, pointed to either a **_maintenance_** of her association with him throughout the intervening period, or a **_restoration_** of their ties in early 2015 after an apparent break in the latter half of 2014[^104]. Ms Ng had opened bank accounts for Harvey to use later in 2015 including the OCBC bank account she had opened for Harvey, for the fictitious “_wedding planning business_”, that she had informed IO Liew of in her first police statement. In analysing Ms Ng’s culpability, it should be noted that she had done this without verifying that _Harvey_ or the “_friend_” he was helping ever intended to run any **_real_** business operating for purpose of planning and organising weddings. Ms Ng’s _blasé_ attitude is clear from her response to the nature of the business she had opened the accounts for[^105]:

> A    Not exactly wedding business but into business to generate profits to redeem the bag, so that I would be given back my losses. As I said, if I’m lucky, I would have the cash but I have made known to Harvey that … I only want my losses to be returned to me. That’s all.

### Accused’s basis for trust was always based on a verbal assurance from Harvey that he was not scamming her and he would not get her into trouble

114    In _Koh Hak Boon_, Yong CJ had emphasized that “It is apparent from the cases that “_reason to believe_” involves a lesser degree of conviction than certainty and a higher one than speculation…”[^106]His honour also cited a Malaysian case which gave useful illustration of to show how salient inferences can be made from a consideration of the situation[^107]:

> 11    In _Ahmad bin Ishak_ v _PP_ <span class="citation">\[1974\] 2 MLJ 21</span>, the Kuantan High Court in its appellate criminal jurisdiction considered “reason to believe” in s 26 of the Malaysian Penal Code:

>> **_Now, ‘reason to believe’, knowledge, intention, are things in a man’s mind and you cannot see it, you cannot hear it._** Nobody who receives stolen goods carries a big banner saying that these are stolen goods. Nor does he shout it from the roof tops. **_You must look into the circumstances and consider if the circumstances are such that any reasonable man could see sufficient cause to believe that it was stolen_**.

> \[Emphasis added\]

115    In this regard Ms Ng’s defence was especially **_flimsy_**, as her basis for trust had been, for all intents and purposes, exclusively premised on verbal assurances from Harvey that he was not scamming her, and he would not get her into trouble, even as he had **_never_** made good on any of his promises. The problem, from her own account, could be seem in her sheer **_incuriosity_** to find out what _Harvey_ was really doing with the accounts, bundled with her blind desire to recover sums that she had expended (ironically from Harvey’s own machinations). Essentially then, Ms Ng’s contention was that she had a valid defence against having any ‘_reason to believe_’ that she had been co-opted to assist in a fraudulent enterprise because she had **_asked_** a person whom she had previously accused of scamming her if he were up to no good, and had “**_trusted him at face value_**” when he had said “**_no_**.”

>   
| 

DPP:

 | 

And yet, you expect us to believe that at no point in time in your relationship with Harvey did you think that he would lie to you?

 |
| 

Accused:

 | 

No. The---as I mentioned earlier, because **_I have cl---clarified and confirmed with Harvey, and he told me, “No, it’s not a scam. Why would I want to get you into trouble?” And based on this, I trust him on face value_** because he say he---he---we will---if I were to pay out this $6,600 (_monies to redeem the bag_), definitely, the bag will be released. But I do not have any more money to claim for this bag. That’s the reason why i---i---it stops there and **_I have to clarify with him, and he say “No_**”.

### The accused’s “Lucas Lies”

116    It would be difficult to see how her position could surmount the application of subjective-objective test referenced in _Ang Jeanette_ and _Koh Hak Boon_ for Ms Ng to the factual matrix and mount an argument that the circumstances would not have imbued her with any “_reasonable grounds to believe_” that she was aiding and abetting _Harvey’s_ criminal enterprise. Unfortunately for Ms Ng, her situation was very much exacerbated by the discovery that very substantial portions of her account in her first statement to IO Liew to have had little relationship with the truth.

117    I was in entire agreement with the learned DPPs articulation of the instances of what he pointed out were _Lucas Lies_ in the accused’s statement to IO Liew. DPP Chong’s summation in the _Prosecution’s Closing Submissions_ was, in my view, well-argued and incisive in highlighting the fundamental gaps in Ms Ng’s defence, and hence worthwhile to set out _in extensio_. There, the learned DPP Chong states[^108]:

> 20    The relevant law is concisely stated in the High Court’s decision in _Er Joo Nguang_ and another v Public Prosecutor \[2000\] 1 SLR(R) 75631 at \[52\] as follows:

>> The relevant authority on the effect of lies told by an accused is the English case _of R v Lucas_ (Ruth) <span class="citation">\[1981\] 1 QB 720</span>; \[1981\] 2 All ER 1008. There, the English Court of Appeal held that the mere fact that an accused told lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, although these lies could, in appropriate circumstances, amount to corroboration because it indicated a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at 724 that there were four criteria to be satisfied before an accused’s lie could amount to corroboration:

>>> The lie … must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a **material issue**. Thirdly, **the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth**. … Fourthly, the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by \[independent\] evidence …

>> \[Emphasis in original\]

> 21    The four criteria of the “_Lucas test_” involve findings of fact. Set out below are illustrations of each and every lie the accused told during the course of investigations which satisfy all criteria of the Lucas test:

> **_Accused’s lies in her statement to IO Liew dated 6 October 2015_**

> 22    In her statement to IO Liew dated 6 October 2015, the accused lied about being the _only_ person using the OCBC bank account which she had in fact opened for Harvey to use. The accused went on to state unequivocally that “_Harvey does not have any access to_ \[the\] _bank account_” and that she was “_the only one that held on to the ATM card and \[has\] banking rights_”. Under further cross-examination, the accused admitted that these were _all lies_ that she _deliberately_ told IO Liew in order to “_buy time_” to “_check with Harvey_”.

> 23    When the prosecution highlighted the sheer incredulity of her claim by pointing out that if she was indeed truthful in her intention to “_check with Harvey_”, there was no need to lie to the police and she could have stated her intention clearly, the accused could only give the feeble excuse that this did not “_strike_ \[her\] _mind_”. Under further cross-examination, the accused inadvertently admitted as well that maybe subconsciously she had lied to “_cover up_” for Harvey, before rapidly retracting her evidence. This Freudian slip by the accused is in fact where the truth resides.

> 24     **_The lies that the accused told IO Liew are material, deliberate and clearly motivated by fear of IO Liew discovering the truth, i.e. at the material time the accused allowed Harvey to have control of her OCBC bank account, she had reasonable grounds to believe that Harvey was using the said OCBC bank account to engage in criminal conduct_**.

> \[Emphasis in bold italics added\]

### Other discrepancies in the accused’s accounts which made inroads to her credibility

118    I should add that there were other discrepancies which were not adequately addressed by the accused in her court testimony. These included Ms Ng wavering as to her relationship with _Harvey_, which varied from “_we are not in a relationship but just friends who are on very good terms_”, as communicated to ASP Seet on 23 November 2015[^109] to transform to “_I am romantically involved with Harvey but I am not in an intimate relationship with him_.” To Inspector Rajiv on 12 January 2016[^110]. As I had mentioned in the foregoing discussion, this shift had likely been prompted by Ms Ng realisation that the seized chat messages would tell a different story. The fact of her downplaying the relationship in the first place would diminish any impression of Ms Ng as a witness of probity and candour.

### Accused’s divergent accounts of her relationship with Harvey over several police statements affects her credibility as sole defence witness

119    The most pronounced episodes of wavering would come from her extremely divergent accounts of **_when, where and whether_** she had met _Harvey_ “in real life”. As this aspect has been set out in detail earlier in these grounds[^111], I will give a skeletal reiteration to demonstrate this point. Ms Ng’s initial version to ASP Seet on 23 November 2015 was “_I have met him up in person once or twice and it was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_” in November 2015. It was before ASP Alan Tan in her 27 February 2017 statement that Ms Ng made the most surprising revelation that she had **_never_** met **_Harvey_** in person, adding yet another dimension on the enigma as to what had ever transpired between the two.

120    To recapitulate, when ASP Tan had asked on 27 February 2017 “_Have you met Harvey_ **_in person_**?”, Ms Ng had unequivocally responded “**_No_**_, I have only seen him over (S)kype_ ”, Her position was to change in another statement recorded before the **_same_** officer on 14 August 2017, when ASP Tan had sought to clarify this apparent contradiction with her initial statement made before ASP Seet about meeting _Harvey_ in Kuala Lumpur, Ms Ng’s response was “_I did not meet him in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as I did not travel overseas during the period of 2014 or 2015_”, Ms Ng’s offered reason for the mis-statement was to that she was “in a state of confusion” and had mistaken a Malaysian meeting with _Andy Clayton_ in 2013 with one with _Harvey_ in 2014. Ms Ng then took a final position that she had indeed met Harvey in person, in Changi Airport “_for a brief encounter for about 5-10 minutes_” Surprisingly, Ms Ng could not be certain that the person she had identified as _Harvey_ was indeed the same individual whom she had communicated with in her _Skype_ chat.

121    While Ms Ng’s motive for producing so many variants of her relationship is unclear, and hence not subject to any finding that this was another _Lucas lie_, the fact that she was prepared to give so many contradictory versions over the course of under two years (November 2015 to August 2017) when she fully understood the seriousness of each occasion that she was making a statement before a police officer, would be cause for the court to doubt her veracity as a witness of truth.

122    While these instances of gross discrepancies implicate Ms Ng as a creditworthy witness (which would be problematic for the defence case, given that she was the sole witness) it is the confluence of Ms Ng’s actions against presenting events between February 2014 and end-2015 which would crystalise her guilt in making a convincing case that Ms Ng had facilitated Harvey’s criminal activity despite having reasonable grounds to believe that the latter was engaged in criminal conduct.

### Summation

123    In summation, it was Ms Ng herself, who first filed a police report against _Harvey_, but had in May 2015 and July 2015, agreed to open a OCBC bank account and HSBC bank account for Harvey, and handed over control of both bank accounts to _Harvey_. Ms Ng’s true **_watershed moment_** occurred when she was called down on 6 October 2015 to assist IO Liew, regarding investigations into deposits which had been made into the said OCBC bank account she had opened for _Harvey_. Ms Ng had of course been categorically warned by IO Liew to cease opening any more bank accounts for Harvey, she had unfortunately gone against the officer’s advice, and she had rather brazenly ignored the unmistakable cue that something was very wrong when the initial accounts she opened were frozen. Ms Ng’s defiance of this warning is epitomised by opening the UOB account after the other accounts had been frozen and having gone on to receive the largest sum of $72 950 between 12 November and 18 December 2015, who was barely a month after her meeting IO Liew for the interview and statement-taking session.

### Defence submissions

124    Learned defence counsel’s submissions[^112] carried two main thrusts, the first was to cast doubt that the prosecution had established the _actus reus_ to support the charges as the ‘respondent’ parties named by the complainants in the other charges had not been _Harvey_, but “_Robin, Dennis and Janos_”[^113], and the second was that Ms Ng lacked the requisite _mens rea_, and as there had been a lack of specificity in the warning that IO Liew had given to Ms Ng as he had couched this in an especially genteel and tentative manner[^114], such that she might have failed to apprehend that _Harvey_ had been a suspect in defrauding other women. Ms Ng had after all, only previously complained of _Harvey’s_ apparent fraud against herself. While Ms Ng had been named there as “_Carole Siew Ng_”, and purportedly the ‘agent” to collect the defrauded sum of US $2000 paid by Ms Cheah Lee Kean, learned counsel pointed out that the party whom Ms Cheah had corresponded with had been one ‘_Elvin Yong Sung’_.[^115]

### The accused’s admission that she had intentionally lied to IO Liew negates any possibility that she failed to understand his warning

125    Taking the second thrust of the defence’s submissions first, it should be noted that from the foregoing, Ms Ng did not deny the troubling fact that she **_lied_** to IO Liew on 6 October 2015. Ms Ng’s ostensible reason to “_buy time_” to “_check with Harvey_” would be utterly irrational if she were unconvinced that _Harvey_ was somehow involved in defrauding Ms Cheah using the OCBC account, which had been frozen, and where she had been referred by (albeit an incomplete version of) her name as the collecting agent. Effectively, this would have meant that Ms Ng was prepared to commit a criminal offence of lying to a police officer _cum_ public servant, simply to clarify a niggling doubt, where she was free to question the validity of the officer’s assumptions on the spot, were she so inclined.

### The accused has the requisite mens rea

126    On the facts, I am satisfied that Ms Ng had suppressed material disclosures deliberately with a view of obscuring her role in facilitating activities which she would have known, or at least strongly suspected, to be illicit. I would accordingly rule that Ms Ng’s untruths in asserting that she had been the only person using the OCBC bank account which she had in fact opened for _Harvey’s_ use, stating that “_Harvey does not have any access to_ \[the\] _bank account_” and that she was “_the only one that held on to the ATM card and_ \[had\] _banking rights_” to be all _Lucas_ lies.

127    Ms Ng has also conceded her suspicions on the large amounts being deposited into the OCBC bank account but had _not_ taken this up with _Harvey_. She also had, prior to her session with IO Liew, received large sums on 22 September 2015 ($45 736.33) and 30 September 2015 ($49 236.72) which were placed in the HSBC account. By her own account Ms Ng had then eschewed confronting _Harvey_, as she was fixated with the possibility of redeeming his “gift” for her, for her to recoup her losses.

128    Ms Ng’s principal line of defence has simply been that she had, _post_ the session with IO Liew, sought _Harvey’s_ assurance that he was not dishonest, or trying to cheat **_her_**. It is axiomatic that asking an individual whom one had been previously defrauded by such questions would hardly be a certain way of ensuring that that individual truly had no such intentions, especially where that individual had never made good on promises of repayment. By the same token, Ms Ng’s claimed attempts would be wholly inadequate to rebut the State’s accusation that she had reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual she knew as _Harvey Hartman_ had been engaged in criminal conduct, when she had assisted him in opening the bank accounts, and dealings with what would plainly be proceeds of criminal activity.

### Defence submissions of actus reus not being fulfilled

129    In relation to learned counsel’s assertion of the _actus reus_ not being fulfilled as a result of _Harvey_ not being specifically named as the culprit respondent by the four victims in the proceeded charges, and hence no proof that Harvey had been connected to the predicate offence from which Ms Ng facilitated the proceeds of crime. This submission unfortunately ignores the **_ground realities_** of money laundering offences, where criminal elements will spare no effort to disguise their identities, cover their tracks and also seek to agglomerate and anonymise their ill-gotten gains. In the realm of love-scams, it would be common for scammers to malleable in adopting a range of on-line _personae_, all too often crafted and curated to appeal to their ‘_marks_’ or targets. These invented identities could vary in occupation, ethnicity and nationality, as demonstrated by the ones used in the proceeded charges of ‘_Robin, Dennis and Janos_’, and ‘_Elvin Yong_’ for the index OCBC case, which had brought Ms Ng to the attention of the police in October 2015.

130    The peculiarities of money laundering operations and the difficulties these presented in CDSA cases was envisaged by VK Rajah JA in _Ang Jeanette_ when his Honour ruled that there ought be no _onus_ on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the crime or class of crime that may constitute the **_predicate_** offence, which of course would be the offence of cheating, contrary to section 420 of the Penal Code. In _Ang Jeanette_, Rajah JA held:

> … There is nothing in (s 44(1)(a) of the CDSA) that requires or points to any need to impose on the Prosecution the heavy and impractical burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the crime or class of crime that may constitute the predicate offence. Further, given the mischief this section is intended to address, a court should be slow in reading in such a requirement. On the other hand, …the Prosecution has to adduce particulars of the commission of a predicate offence or a class thereof. Such a construction provides sufficient flexibility to the Prosecution in proving the predicate criminal conduct under the myriad factual circumstances in which money laundering offences can be committed, and does so without undermining the careful course that Parliament has steered between requiring the Prosecution to prove the commission of a _specific predicate criminal offence_ and allowing the Prosecution to make _wholly unparticularised allegations of criminal conduct_. **_To elaborate, it is not necessary for the Prosecution to satisfy the court beyond a reasonable doubt that all the constituent elements of a specific offence listed in the Second Schedule have been met_**. This approach would mitigate the Prosecution’s understandable concern that it would have to prove _two_ offences to the same exacting standards every time it undertakes a prosecution of an offence under s 44(1)(_a_) of the CDSA. … **_Equally, circumstances could well arise where the only logical inference to any reasonable person is that the moneys involved in the arrangement are criminal property, and that the other person engages in, or has engaged in, or has benefited from, criminal conduct_**…

> \[Emphasis in _italics_ in the original, emphasis in **_bold italics_** added\]

131    Within the factual matrix of this case, there is no doubt that the predicate offence of cheating had been committed in all four instances, where the victims have paid over monies into the accounts opened by the accused and lost varying sum. The learned DPP has also stressed that this submission was late in the day, given that no issue of actus reus was brought up when learned counsel filed his case for the defence, where the accused case had been premised an absence of _mens rea_ on the part of the accused[^116]:

> …(A)t \[11\] of the Case for Defence, it was stated by the Defence that “\[the accused\] did not commit any of the offences in that she did not have any _mens rea_ to commit any of the alleged offences”. It is disingenuous for the Defence to now take the position that the _actus reus_ elements of the charges against the accused are disputed and there is not even some evidence linking the deposits made by the victims into the accused’s bank accounts, to particular criminal conduct, i.e. scams. To this end, we would also highlight section 169(1)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code and invite the Court to draw such inference as it thinks fit where the defence has put forward a case at trial, which is otherwise inconsistent with the Case for Defence.

132    I would also agree with the prosecution’s contention that there is nothing in section 44 or section 47 of the CDSA which require them to “_establish_” the “_identity_” (true or otherwise) of the other person named in the charge against the accused[^117].The bottom line as far as actus reus was concerned was ultimately the fact of Ms Ng opening (and operating) the receiving accounts at _Harvey’s_ behest, and her agreement to allow _Harvey_ to operate and control these accounts, not least by her mailing over the linked ATM cards to Malaysia for him to use. Following the High Court’s pronouncements _Ang Jeanette_, I do not think the prosecution has failed to prove the _actus reus_ elements for both the section 44 and section 47 CDSA offences, merely because the identities of ‘_Robin, Dennis and Janos_’ remain unknown. Whether they were _Harvey’s_ confederates or minions, or even alternative _avatar_ personalities created by _Harvey_ himself is not something that needed to be proven for a prosecution of this nature. All that was relevant was the fact of the payments being indexed to the bank accounts opened by the accused for _Harvey_’s use. Of that, the prosecution has annexed the requisite bank statements showing the deposits. Ultimately, it was Ms Ng who would have known _Harvey_ best, given their documented association from early 2014 to June 2017. Even then, her description of her actual association with _Harvey_ has proven, from police statements and her court testimony, to be strangely mutable.

## Conviction

133    All considered, I found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt and found Ms Ng Siew Wai Carole to be guilty as charged and convicted her on all four proceeded charges.

## SENTENCE

### Mitigation

134    In his plea in mitigation, counsel indicated that Ms Ng was a single mother of two, who was the primary caregiver of her 93-year-old father. He described her as a loving mother who worked hard and had brought her two children alone after her divorce. He also emphasized Ms Ng’s lack of a criminal antecedent record.

### Sentencing considerations

135    In sentencing, Ms Ng faced two charges under section 44(1)(a) for her involvement in an arrangement with _Harvey_, despite reasonable grounds, which facilitated his control of benefits of criminal conduct, and two charges under section 47(3) of the CDSA of acquiring property which she had reasonable grounds to believe represented _Harvey’s_ benefits from criminal conduct. The focus would be on the section 44(1)(a) charges, as these generally carried a far heavier tariff.

136    For the section 44, CDSA offences (_which were the first and second charges_), the five-stage sentencing framework established in _Huang Ying-Chun v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 269</span> (“**_Huang Ying-Chun_**”). This was a guideline case which set up a universally applicable framework for money laundering related offences. The five steps entailed:

> (1)    Identifying the level of harm and level of culpability

> (2)    Identify the applicable sentencing range

> (3)    Identify the appropriate starting point within the indicative sentencing range

> (4)    Make adjustments to the starting point to account for offender -specific factors.

> (5)    Make further adjustments to take into account the totality principle.

137    The indicative sentencing range would run as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="23.875224955009%"> <col width="25.374925014997%"> <col width="25.374925014997%"> <col width="25.374925014997%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Harm</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Slight</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Moderate</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Severe</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fine or short custodial sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10-30 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30-60 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Medium</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10-30 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30-60 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60-90 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">High</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">30-60 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">60-90 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">90-120 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

138    Both the prosecution and defence applied the framework to arrive at radically different proposed sentences.

### Defence submissions on sentence

139    Counsel went to considerable detail on the background facts behind the two section 44(1)(a) CDSA charges and played down Ms Ng’s culpability to assert that there was a “_severe lack of proof_” that Ms Ng had knowledge of the underlying predicate offence that Harvey was engaged in criminal conduct[^118]. He also indicated that the case had not involved a syndicate, and that the quantum involved was a tenth of that in _Huang Ying-Chun_ where the offender had received a 66-month sentence. Learned counsel proposed that the harm was **_slight_** and the culpability **_low_**. He proposed a fine of $60 000 after considering offender specific factors and brought this down after applying the fourth step to propose $ 8000 for the first charge and $42 000 for the second charge. I should add my sense that learned counsel’s proposal was not in keeping with cases of this genre, where custodial sentences have been imposed for cases with an equivalent factual matrix.

### Prosecution’s sentencing submissions

140    The prosecution had initially proposed the following tariffs

> (a)     DAC 906766-2018 (1st Charge) involving a sum of $27, 600 – **14 months’ imprisonment**

> (b)     DAC 906767-2018(2nd Charge) involving a sum of $72 050 – **22 months’ imprisonment**

141    The learned DPP emphasised the pre-eminence of deterrence as the principal sentencing consideration, He had also urged the court to take cognisance of “_the serious nature of the offending conduct, the lack of any genuine remorse and the blatant disregard the accused has displayed towards the police in the course of investigations_”. He had also cited the case of _Xia Qin Lai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] SGHC 232</span> for the proposition that “…_the principle of deterrence (especially general deterrence) dictated that the length of the custodial sentence awarded had to be a not insubstantial one, in order to drive home the message to other like-minded persons that such offences will not be tolerated, but not so much as to be unjust in the circumstances of the case_.”[^119]

142    I will now turn to the learned DPP’s specific analysis in applying the _Huang Ying-Chun_ framework to the instant case. The **_offence specific factor_**, which are considered at the first stage were pitched as follows:

> **FACTORS GOING TOWARDS HARM**

> (a)     **Amount cheated** (Slight to Moderate = $27,600 + $72,050)

> (b)     **No** **involvement of Syndicate**

> (c)     **Involvement of transnational element** (Slight to Moderate = multiple remittances of the cheated amounts were made to overseas recipients or withdrawn overseas)

> (d)     **Seriousness of the predicate offence** (Moderate to Severe = Predicate offences involved online scams which has plagued society as seen from the Police Brochure in exhibit D2)

> (e)     **No** **harm done to confidence in public administration**

> **FACTORS GOING TOWARD CULPABILITY**

> (a)     **Degree of planning and premeditation** (High = the accused admitted to opening multiple bank accounts for Harvey, deliberately lying multiple times to the police during investigations about the purpose of the bank accounts and lying to remittance staff about the purpose of transfers)

> (b)     **Level of sophistication** (Low = limited to opening bank accounts and remitting the deposits received)

> (c)     **Duration of offending** (Medium = 3 months, over the period of October to December)

> (d)     **Offender’s role** (Low = limited to opening bank accounts and remitting the deposits received)

> (e)     **No** **abuse of position and breach of trust**

> (f)     **Mental state of offender** (Medium = reasonable grounds to believe)

> (g)     **Commission of offence was** **not** **sole purpose for being in Singapore**

> (h)     **Offender’s knowledge of underlying predicate offence** (Medium = had reasonable grounds to believe criminal proceeds were from cheating as accused herself had been cheated before by the very same Harvey)

> (i)     **Prospect of large reward** (promised US$300 000 in a bag)

143    For offender-specific factors, DPP noted the offender’s lack of antecedents, and the absence of TIC charges. He emphasized however that Ms Ng had made no restitution and lied multiple times to the police during investigations. She had also insisted on her right of trial, and thus could not be accorded the discount in sentence usually conferred upon a timeous plea of guilt. He had thus pitched Ms Ng’s level of **_harm_** to the **_slight to moderate_** range and set her **_culpability_** at **_medium_**.

### Sentencing submissions for the section 47(3) CDSA charges

144    For the section 47, CDSA offences (third and fourth charges), learned defence counsel proposed the following fines:

> DAC 906768-2018(Third charge) involving SGD 10,000 – **$8000 fine.**

> DAC 906769-2018 (Fourth charge) involving SGD 4,000 – **$2000 fine.**

145    For the section 47, CDSA offences (third and fourth charges), the DPP proposed the sentencing bands set out in _Chong Kum Heng_ v _Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 21</span> (“_Chong Kum Heng_”). The DPP acknowledged that _Chong Kum Heng_ had involved “**_self-laundering offences_**” under section 47(1)(c) of the CDSA, the sentencing bands, while still relevant to section 47(3), CDSA offences, had to be calibrated downward to recognise the lower culpability of an accused against having reasonable grounds to believe he was laundering of another person’s criminal benefits in section 47(3) CDSA as opposed to one having actual knowledge of laundering, as this was his own criminal benefits in section 47(1)(c). Accordingly, the following sentences were proposed

> DAC 906768-2018(Third charge) involving SGD 10,000 – **one month’s** imprisonment

> DAC 906769-2018 (Fourth charge) involving SGD 4,000 – **two weeks’** imprisonment

### Prosecution’s initial proposed global sentence

146    The prosecution had submitted that the sentences for one section 44(1)(a) charge, DAC 906767-2018 and one section 47(3) charge, DAC 906768-2018 run consecutively, for a **_global imprisonment term of 23 months’ imprisonment_**, with the sentences for the remaining charges to run concurrently. I pointed out that while the sentence was generally in line with stereotypical money-mule cases, they appeared to be on the **_high side_** for love-scam cases, where the offender was oft-times a victim herself, who had been usually co-opted by the principal using emotional manipulation and/or a monetary enticement. The learned DPP had asked for time, and returned with a markedly reduced sentencing proposal, which he had supported with a number of preceding love-scam cases.

### The prosecution’s reconsidered sentencing position

147    DPP Chong reverted after an adjournment with precedent CDSA cases involving love-scams, and added that the prosecution had reconsidered its original sentencing principle, having reviewed a recent case of **_Public Prosecutor v Ng Koon Lay[^120]_**on 12 August 2020 for _PP v Ng Koon Lay (“Ng Koon Lay”)._ The case bore strong similarities with the instant case, save that _Ng Koon Lay_ involved a higher quantum for the two section 44 CDSA offences of $174,750 and $47,050 respectively. The learned DPP helpfully extended the Statement of Facts, Mitigation Plea and Schedule of Offences for _Ng Koon Lay_ for the court’s consideration_._[^121] He noted that in _Ng Koon Lay_, the offender was sentenced to, _inter alia_, the following imprisonment terms for two proceeded section 44(1), CDSA offences:

> (a)     DAC 919468-2018 involving SGD 47,050 – 6 months’ imprisonment

> (b)     DAC 919470-2018) involving SGD 174,750 – 12 months’ imprisonment

148    Taking into consideration the sentences meted out in _Ng Koon Lay_ and considering the key similarities and differences in the facts of the present case, the learned DPP’s revised recommendation of appropriate sentences for the section 44 CDSA charges faced by Ms Ng were:

> (a)     1st Charge (DAC 906766-2018) involving SGD 27, 600 – **6 months’ imprisonment**

> (b)     2nd Charge (DAC 906767-2018) involving SGD 72,050 – **12 months’ imprisonment**

149    The prosecution had maintained its recommendation for the section 147 CDSA charges, as the sentencing bands set out in _Chong Kum Heng_ were still relevant. Maintaining their position for one section 44 and one section 47 charge to run consecutively, the prosecution recommended that Ms Ng receive a **_global term_** of **_13 months’ imprisonment_**. [^122] The defence made a counter submission that both the _Huang Ying Chun_ and _Chong Kum Heng_ were invalid, and maintained their stand that Ms Ng should receive non-custodial penalties.

### Salient parts of SOF for Ng Koon Lay

150    There was no appeal in _Ng Koon Lay_, and hence no reasoned grounds of decision. I am of course mindful of the principle that _“unreported cases carry little if any precedential value because they are unreasoned_”, as expressed in _Public Prosecutor_ v _Siow Kai Yuan Terrence_ \[2020\] SGHC at \[86\] It would nevertheless be essential for the court to be consistent in imposing sentences, with like cases receiving like sentences. This was unequivocally expressed in _Chong Han Rui v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHC 25</span> where Menon CJ had held that ‘_Consistency in sentencing is a key principle in our criminal justice system This is rooted in the notion that all are equal before the law…To put it simply, those of similar culpability should receive similar sentences, while those of greater culpability should generally be more severely punished’_ For completeness in analysis therefore, I have set out the salient portions of the statement of facts for _Ng Lay Koon_ to afford a basis of comparison with the instant case[^123].

> 1    The accused is Ng Koon Lay (_identification number)_.

> **FACTS RELATING TO DAC-935180-2017 & DAC-935181-2017**

> 2    Sometime in March 2015, the accused got acquainted with an unknown person known as ‘Greg L Johnson’ through Facebook. They stayed in contact over Facebook and phone.

> 3    As the accused was in some financial difficulty, she requested for a loan from Greg. Sometime in August 2016, Greg told the accused that a friend of his was willing to provide a $9,000 loan to the accused. However, the accused was to provide her bank account to receive some funds. She was to forward the funds to a designated bank account, and was allowed to deduct the loan sum from the monies she received. The accused then provided a UOB bank account (_number_) to Greg. A sum of $71,000 was received in the UOB account, and the accused transferred $62,000 to another bank account as instructed.

> 4     **_On 22 September 2016, the accused received a call from the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”), asking her to attend an interview on 23 September 2016. Over the phone, the accused was given a warning not to receive any more monies in her bank account as her bank account had been used to receive illegal funds_**.

> 5    The $71,000 received in the UOB account was transferred by the victim of an e-mail spoofing scam. The victim had received an e-mail, purporting to be from his employer, to transfer $71,000 from the company’s bank account to the UOB account.

> 6     **_On 23 September 2016, the accused attended the CAD interview and was again warned not to use her bank account to receive funds from unknown persons, and to stop contacting Greg. The accused was also told that if she received any further funds from Greg, she was to report the matter to the Police_**. The accused then surrendered her Facebook account to CAD.

> 7     **_After the 23 September 2016 interview, she set up a second Facebook account in order to keep in contact with Greg, despite CAD’s warnings._** The accused then asked Greg for a further loan. Greg asked the accused to receive another sum of money in her bank account, and in exchange, she would get a $6,500 loan.

> (\[8\]-\[11\] _cover specific details of transfers_)

> 12    Given CAD’s warnings to the accused on 22 and 23 September 2016, the accused had reason to believe that the USD88,000 she received in her Citibank account was stolen property, and correspondingly, she had reasonable grounds to believe that the $89,860 which she transferred to the Pak Multi Metal’s DBS account were another person’s benefits of criminal conduct.

> 13    By reason of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s. 411 of the Penal Code when she received the USD88,000 in her Citibank account and an offence under s. 47(2)(b) and punishable under s. 47(6) of the CDSA, when she transferred $89,860 from the Citibank account to Pak Multi Metal’s DBS account.

> **FACTS RELATING TO DAC-919468-2018 & DAC-919470-2018**

> 14    Sometime in 2015, the accused got acquainted with an unknown person known as ‘David Bay’ online. They stayed in contact over _Whatsapp_.

> 15    Sometime in 2017, David contacted the accused and told her that he needed her to provide bank accounts to receive funds. The funds were purportedly to pay for David’s hospitalisation fees and for his business. In return, the accused would be allowed to use some of the funds she received for David. The accused agreed to help David. Pursuant to this, the accused opened (a Maybank and a CIMB account)

> 16     **_After opening the bank accounts, the accused mailed the ATM cards and their PIN to a Malaysian addressed that David provided_**.

> 17    When opening the CIMB account, the accused had also applied for internet banking. She thus retained control of the CIMB account through internet banking, despite mailing the ATM card overseas.

> 18    Between 4 September 2017 and 18 September 2017, 4 victims of internet love scams had transferred a total of $47,050 into the Maybank account.

> 19    Between 18 August 2017 and 27 August 2017, a victim of an internet love scam had transferred a total of $174,750 into the CIMB account.

> 20    The monies that were transferred into the Maybank and CIMB accounts were mostly withdrawn via ATM overseas. The accused used part of the funds transferred into the CIMB account for her own purposes.

> 21    The 5 victims were thus victims of s. 420 Penal Code offences. The Second Schedule to the CCDSA includes s. 420 Penal Code offences as a serious offence, which constitutes “criminal conduct” as defined in s. 2 of the CDSA. The funds that were received in the Maybank and CIMB accounts were thus benefits of criminal conduct.

> 22    By opening the Maybank and CIMB accounts and sending the ATM cards to David in Malaysia, the accused had entered into arrangements with David. She had reasonable grounds to believe that by these arrangements, she would have facilitated David’s retention of his benefits of criminal conduct.

> 23     **_At the material time, the accused had already been given repeated warnings by CAD not to provide her bank accounts to receive funds from unknown persons, and was in fact under 2 separate sets of investigations when she opened the Maybank and CIMB accounts_**. Despite this, she agreed to help David, whom she had never met before. The accused was also aware that David had lied to her, as David had continued to correspond with the accused over Whatsapp, despite claiming to be incarcerated in prison. The accused thus had reasonable grounds to believe that David was a person who engaged in criminal conduct.

> 24    By reason of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under s. 44(1)(a) and punishable under s. 44(5)(a) of the CDSA.

> 25    At present, a sum of $2,600.74 remains in the Maybank account.

> \[Emphasis added\]

151    For the case of _Ng Koon Lay_, DPP Chong highlighted the areas of similarity

> **_Similarities_**

> 1.    Both were themselves victims of love scams and had transferred their own funds to their online “lovers”.

> 2.    Both had incurred some form of personal financial hardship in order to provide funds to their online “lovers”.

> 3.    Both were promised a luggage of cash in return for assisting their online “lovers

### Other preceding CDSA cases involving online relationships and previous warnings being administered

152    DPP Chong had also helpfully provided a schedule of five preceding cases of this sub-genre of love scams which involved both on-line relationships and where the offenders had persisted despite warnings being administered. To avoid undue prolixity, and mindful that these are unreported cases with fewer compelling similarities to _Ng Koon Lay_ , I have only highlighted the sentences imposed for the section 44 CDSA charges, as the purpose of the analysis is to allow a **_general sensing_** of the treatment of these cases in sentencing.

> 1.     **_PP v Sim Leng Leng_** DAC 927057 of 2018 & Ors

### Final sentencing remarks

153    Ultimately, what can be seen is the fact that sentences for both section 44 and section 47 charges for substantial amounts are generally moderate custodial terms. I do not find any validity in learned counsel’s contention that the framework in **_Huang Ying-chun_** should not apply to cases of this genre of love scam cases. I do sense however that the culpability ought be calibrated on a lower level to generally allow for **_‘low’_** culpability where there has been intense psychological and emotional pressure imposed on an accused person, leaving them entrapped and hence vulnerable to exploitation. This would be distinct from other money mule cases where the transactions occurred on an ‘_arms-length_’ basis with motives predicated on pure monetary gain, and where culpability would then appropriately be pitched at a higher level. I would hasten to add that the above is a **_general_** observation, and broadly applicable to love-scam cases. Learned counsel has not put any psychological history of Ms Ng before the court, and hence there is no evidence that she suffers (or suffered) any mental health condition or frailty that is relevant to the case, notwithstanding her idiosyncratic actions detailed above. It should also be recalled that Ms Ng has made no restitution, and the not inconsiderable losses her actions caused, including one set amounting to over $72 000, stay where they fall, with the uncompensated victims facing the pecuniary consequences of her actions.

154    I do note the similarities between this case with that of _Ng Koon Lay_. There are also of course distinguishing aspects. It would be trite to state that sentences would need to have regard to the unique circumstances of each case. For DAC 906766 of 2018, the first charge under section 44(1) of the CDSA, I would regard this case to be one of **_slight_** harm and **_low_** culpability, and would have been inclined to impose a term of five months’ imprisonment from the first step consideration using the _Huang Ying-chun_ framework to assess offence-specific factors. Upon a consideration of offender-specific factors, including Ms Ng’s clean record, and a last look in the interests of totality, I titrated the sentence downward to **_four months and two weeks’ imprisonment_**.

155    For the second section 44 CDSA charge (DAC 906767 of 2018), my analysis of the _Huang Ying-chun_, along with the 12-month imprisonment sentence imposed in _Ng Koon Lay_ where a higher quantum was involved, convinced me that a term of 10 months imprisonment would be appropriate on consideration of offence specific factors alone, where I was of the view that this particular offence should be regarded as one of **_moderate_** harm and **_low_** culpability.

156    After a consideration of offender-specific consideration, and to address the interests of totality and proportionality in sentencing, I was of the view that a **_downward_** adjustment to a term of nine months’ imprisonment was merited. For DAC 906768-2018, the charge under Section 47 of the CDSA, I was minded to impose one month’s imprisonment. For DAC 906769- 2018, the final section 47 CDSA charge. I was minded to impose a term of two weeks’ imprisonment. No adjustment for totality was made, as the other two charges had been adjusted to address this consideration. I was also of the view that one section 44 CDSA charge (DAC 906767-2018) and one section 47 CDSA charge (DAC 906768-2018) should run consecutively, to yield a final sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment.

### Sentence imposed

157    The following sentences were pronounced:

158    I ordered the sentences in DAC-906767-2018 and DAC-906768-2018 to run consecutively, and the sentences in DAC-906766-2018 and DAC-906769-2018 to run concurrently. The global sentence imposed was thus **_ten (10) months' imprisonment_**. I do believe that the foregoing will show this to be a condign punishment, which addresses the stark need for effective deterrence for offences of this nature, but a global sentence that concomitantly would not be regarded as either crushing, or one that was unresponsive to, or inconsonant with, Ms Ng’s rehabilitative prospects.

### Present status of accused person

159    Upon her application, Ms Ng was granted bail, and remains on bail pending the conclusion of her appeal.
