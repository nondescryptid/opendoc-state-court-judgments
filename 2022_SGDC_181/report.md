### District Judge Wong Li Tein:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mohammad Raihan Bin Khamis, a 42-year-old male Singaporean, pleaded guilty to four charges (“proceeded charges”) under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, 2008 Rev Ed (“MDA”). The first two charges were for being in possession of a controlled drug under s 8(a) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA, whilst the third and fourth charges were for consumption of a specified drug under s 8(b)(ii) punishable under s 33A(1) of the same Act. As the accused had previously been convicted of drug possession and consumption offences, the proceeded charges against him attracted enhanced punishment under the MDA.

2       The proceeded charges read as follows:

4       Having carefully considered the facts of the case, the Prosecution’s submission on sentence and the accused’s mitigation plea, I sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment with effect from 22 June 2020 (the date of arrest) and six strokes of the cane as follows:

> a.     DAC-900527-2021: Two years’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> b.     DAC-900528-2021: Two years’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> c.     DAC-900529-2021: Six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the case (concurrent); and

> d.     DAC-900530-2021: Six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the case (consecutive).

5       The accused being dissatisfied with the sentence meted out against him filed a Notice of Appeal on 19 May 2022.

6       I set out the reasons for my decision below.

## Salient Facts

7       The accused admitted to the “Statement of Facts” without qualification, for which salient facts I have summarised below.

8       The accused was managing a logistics and cleaning company at the time of the offence. The Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) had received intelligence that he was supplying Methamphetamine to one Mohamed Noor bin Mohamed Nasir (“Noor”), a 42-year-old man in June 2020. Investigations revealed that on 14 June 2020 at around 4.00pm, Noor was sold at least 1.90 grams of Methamphetamine by the accused along Lorong 27A Geylang, Singapore. Slightly more than a week later, on 22 June 2020 before 3.10pm, the accused received a black ziplock bag (“the black ziplock bag”) containing not less than 68.50grams of Methamphetamine from an unknown Chinese man around the vicinity of Bras Basah, Singapore. He then drove to Lorong 27A Geylang intending to sell the contents of the black ziplock bag to Noor.

9       At around 3.10pm on the same day, the accused was arrested by CNB officers along 7 Lorong 27A Geylang on the suspicion of having committed offences under the MDA. The accused put up a struggle during the arrest and threw the black ziplock bag on the ground.

10     On the same day at around 7.10pm, a search was conducted at the accused’s apartment located at Blk 632 Bedok Reservoir Road #XXX, Singapore and the following items were found:

> a.     One packet and one sachet of crystalline substance marked "R-03"; and

> b.     One packet and one straw containing granular powdery substance marked "R-04".

#### Facts relating to DAC-900527-2021(possession (enhanced punishment) charge)

11     Exhibit R-03 was analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA") and found to contain not less than 7.52 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 5.11g of Methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the MDA.

12     The accused admitted to the ownership and possession of Exhibit R-03 for his own consumption without authorization and has thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA.

13     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused had been convicted on 4 August 2009 of an offence of possession of a controlled drug, to wit, Cannabis, under s 8(a) of the MDA and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, and he shall now be punished with enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to DAC-900528-2021(possession (enhanced punishment) charge)

14     Exhibit R-04 was analysed by the Health Sciences Authority and found to contain not less than 1.36 grams of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.01grams of Diamorphine, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the MDA.

15     The accused admitted to the ownership and possession of Exhibit R-04 for his own consumption without authorisation and has thereby committed an offence under s 8(a) of the MDA.

16     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused had been convicted on 4 August 2009 of an offence of possession of a controlled drug, to wit, Cannabis, under s 8(a) of the MDA and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment, and he shall now be punished with enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to DAC-900529-2021(consumption (enhanced punishment) charge)

17     Following his arrest, the accused was brought to CNB headquarters where he provided two bottles of urine samples marked “C-SA-20-00770-1 MOHAMMAD RAIHAN BIN KHAMIS SXXX” and “C-SA-20-00770-2 MOHAMMAD RAIHAN BIN KHAMIS SXXX” to be sent to the HSA for analysis.

18     The urine samples were analysed by HSA and found to contain Methamphetamine. The accused admitted to consuming “Ice” (the street name for Methamphetamine) daily and had consumed it on the morning of the day of his arrest. As he was not authorised to consume Methamphetamine, he had thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

19     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused had been convicted on 4 August 2009 of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and was on 17 January 2014 pursuant to an order made by the Deputy Director of CNB admitted to Drug Rehabilitation Centre (“DRC”), and he shall therefore be punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to DAC-900530-2021(consumption (enhanced punishment) charge)

20     The same urine samples marked “C-SA-20-00770-1 MOHAMMAD RAIHAN BIN KHAMIS SXXX” and “C-SA-20-00770-2 MOHAMMAD RAIHAN BIN KHAMIS SXXX” were analysed by HSA and found to contain Morphine. The accused admitted that he had smoked Heroin (another name for Diamorphine) in the week leading up to his arrest on 22 June 2020 and that he smoked the drug a few times per week. As the accused was not authorised to consume Morphine, and he had thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

21     Prior to the commission of the said offence, the accused had been convicted on 4 August 2009 of an offence of consumption of a specified drug, to wit, Methamphetamine, under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and was on 17 January 2014 pursuant to an order made by the Deputy Director of CNB admitted to DRC, and he shall therefore be punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA.

## Antecedents

22     The accused had drug-related antecedents, with drug convictions recorded in 2009, 2013, 2014 and 2015. His first drug-related convictions were for drug trafficking in a controlled drug (5 years’ imprisonment with 5 strokes of the cane), drug possession (12 months’ imprisonment) and drug consumption (12 months’ imprisonment) on 4 August 2009. His other drug-related offences are summarized as follows:

> c.     Drug consumption (Methamphetamine): Placed under drug supervision for 24 months on 20 August 2013;

> d.     Drug consumption (Methamphetamine): Placed under drug supervision for 6 months on 17 January 2014;

> e.     Drug consumption (Morphine): DRC order extended for 12 months on 17 January 2014; and

> f.     Drug consumption (Methamphetamine): Placed under drug supervision for 24 months on 16 July 2015.

23     The accused’s drug antecedents were the reason that he faced enhanced punishment for the present drug charges.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

24     The Prosecution sought a global sentence of 10 to 12 years’ imprisonment with the mandatory minimum of six strokes of the cane, comprising the sentences:

> g.     DAC-900527-2021 (possession (enhanced punishment) charge): uplift of one year’s imprisonment above the statutory minimum to three years’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> h.     DAC-900528-2021 (possession (enhanced punishment) charge): uplift of one year’s imprisonment above the statutory minimum to three years’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> i.     DAC-900529-2021 (consumption (enhanced punishment) charge): six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane (consecutive); and

> j.     DAC-900530-2021 (consumption (enhanced punishment) charge): six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane (concurrent).

25     For the possession charges in DAC-900527-2021 and DAC-900528-2021, the Prosecution submitted that an uplift of one year’s imprisonment from the statutory minimum of two years was warranted in view of the fact that the accused faced two charges of possession of Methamphetamine for purposes of trafficking (DAC-911192-2020) as a repeated offender, which was taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing. One of these charges were for a “significant amount” of 68.5 grams of Methamphetamine which would minimally carry a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. Further, he also faced a TIC charge for the possession of drug taking utensils under s 9 of the MDA (DAC-900531 -2021).

26     For DAC-900529-2021 and DAC-900530-2021, the Prosecution submitted that the accused had been consuming Methamphetamine and Morphine, both controlled drugs. Apart from his conviction on 14 August 2009 for drug-related offences and DRC order on 17 January 2014 for which he faced enhanced punishment, the accused had other antecedents which showed that he was a “serious drug abuser” despite best efforts by the State to reform him.

27     In urging the Court to order for three sentences to run consecutively, the Prosecution argued that the accused faced two TIC charges for separate incidents of trafficking with enhanced punishment which would attract a minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane each. From 2009, he had been involved heavily in drugs and committed fresh and serious drug-related offences less than three years since his last drug supervision ended on 16 July 2017. Calibrating the individual sentences according to arrive at between 10 to 12 years’ imprisonment with mandatory caning would therefore be proportionate.

## Mitigation Plea

28     In his handwritten mitigation plea, the accused stated that he was truly remorseful for having committed the offences. He urged the Court to consider that the offences in the proceeded charges were committed on the same day and that he had admitted to them to the arresting officers when he was arrested. Further, the total amount of controlled drugs under each of the possession charges after HSA analysing was small, being not less than 5.11 grams of Methamphetamine and 0.01 grams of Diamorphine in DAC-900527-2021 and DAC-900528-2021respectively.

29     The accused informed the Court that he was the sole breadwinner of his family consisting of his wife and his 18-year-old son. Because he had been in remand for 23 months at the time of the plea, the mortgage payment for his three-room HDB flat was in arrears and HDB had been chasing his wife for it. Additionally, his father was in ill health and had been frequenting the National University Hospital due to heart complications and other illnesses, whilst his mother suffered a broken rib when she was trying to help his father move around the house.

## Decision on Sentence

30     It was clear in this case that the accused was a recalcitrant multiple offender with a history of drug abuse and drug-related offences. Although the Prosecution decided to proceed with charges against him which were less serious than two charges which had been taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, each carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane, the Court must consider his overall culpability in the light of the full facts of the case, in order to determine the most appropriate sentence for the accused.

### Principles for sentencing a multiple offender

31     The decision of the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 148</span> (“_Raveen_”) provide guidance on the approach in sentencing an accused person facing multiple charges through an analytical framework, the relevant portion for which I reproduced below:

> 98    In summary, the relevant principles in sentencing a multiple offender are as follows:

>> (a)    The first stage of the sentencing analysis is for the sentencing court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence….In arriving at the individual sentences, the sentencing court will generally have to consider the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that bear upon each discrete sentence (see \[37\] above).

>> (b)    The second stage of the sentencing analysis is to determine how the individual sentences should run. In this regard, the starting point of the analysis is whether the offences are unrelated and this is determined by considering whether they involve a single invasion of the same legally protected interest (see \[68\]–\[70\] above). As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the CPC.…

>> (c)    The third stage of the sentencing analysis is to apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality (see \[73\] above). Specifically, there are two limbs to the totality principle. First, the court should examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. Second, the court should examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects….

>> (d)    Across all stages of the analysis, the sentencing court should be careful not to offend the rule against double counting….It applies to both aggravating and mitigating factors, and it may arise in cases involving single offences as it does in cases involving multiple offending. However, it does not necessarily violate the rule against double counting if a fact constituting a mitigating factor is again taken into account in the application of the totality principle even though it has been given effect to elsewhere in the sentencing analysis (see \[91\]–\[94\] above).

32     The first step would be to determine the sentences for each individual charge, followed by deciding how each of these sentences should run. The third and final step would be to apply the totality principle and take a \`last look’ at the aggregate sentence to see if it was sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality.

### Stage 1: Determining the sentence for the individual charge

#### Sentence for the possession (enhanced punishment) charges

33     Apart from the proceeded charges, the accused had not one, but two possession for purposes of trafficking charges which were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. As pointed out by the Prosecution, one of these TIC charges was for a sizeable quantity of 68.5 grams of Methamphetamine. The accused also had one TIC charge for the possession of drug utensils.

34     Taken together, it would have been justified for the mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment for each of DAC-900527-2021 and DAC-900528-2021 to be increased to three years.

#### Sentence for the consumption (enhanced punishment) charge

35     The mandatory minimum for each of the consumption (enhanced punishment) charges which the accused faced in DAC-900529-2021 and DAC-900530-2021 was five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. Whilst the mandatory minimum would already have taken into account the necessary uplift in view of the offender’s previous offences, I noted that the accused was not simply a repeat offender but an undeterred drug abuser who has experimented in a variety of substances despite efforts to rehabilitate him. In the present charges, the accused admitted to abusing Methamphetamine and Morphine regularly before he was arrested. He also had a history of consuming Cannabis and cannabinol derivatives. The accused was ordered to be place under drug supervision twice, in addition to imprisonment sentences, but he continued to consume drugs and committed the present offences less than three years after his last DRC supervision ended on 16 July 2017.

36     As such, I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift to the mandatory minimum was warranted in this case and a sentence of six years’ imprisonment with three strokes for each of DAC-900529-2021 and DAC-900530-2021 would be appropriate.

### Stage 2: Deciding how the individual sentences should run

37     The second stage of the _Raveen_ framework would be to determine how each of the individual sentences should run by considering if the offences faced by the accused were related and whether the offences involved a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. As a general rule, sentences for unrelated offences should run consecutively, while sentences for offences which form part of a single transaction should run concurrently, subject to the requirement in s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed (“CPC”).

38     In the present case, although the accused had consumed both Methamphetamine and Morphine in DAC-900529-2021 and DAC-900530-2021 respectively, these substances were found in his urine samples which were taken at the same time shortly after his arrest. The accused admitted to consuming both of Methamphetamine and Morphine regularly prior to his arrest. As such, I was of the view that these charges should run concurrently.

39     As for the possession (enhanced punishment) charges, the drugs in DAC-900527-2021 and DAC-900528-2021 were found in separate packaging on the accused when he was arrested. Although they were found on his person at the same time, I noted that he faced two TIC charges for separate incidents of trafficking with enhanced punishment, each of which would attract 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane at the minimum. As noted by CJ Menon in _Raveen_ at \[42\] “(A)ll else being equal, a multiple offender bears greater culpability and will have caused greater harm than an offender who has committed only a single offence.” Bearing the TIC charges in mind, I agreed with the Prosecution that each of the possession (enhanced punishment) charges attracted its own distinct punishment and should run consecutively. Running the sentences consecutive was the only way to give real effect and recognition to the accused’s greater culpability in the commission of these offences taken as a whole.

### Stage 3: Totality principle and \`last look’

40     In the third and final stage of the _Raveen_ framework, the Court is to “…apply the totality principle and take a “last look” at all the facts and circumstances to ensure that the aggregate sentence is sufficient and proportionate to the offender’s overall criminality”. In this regard, the two applicable limbs of the totality principle would be to:

> a.     First, examine whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed; and

> b.     Secondly, examine whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with his past record and future prospects.

41     Running the three sentences consecutively as submitted by the Prosecution would essentially mean that the accused faced a total sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane based on the following individual sentences:

> a.     DAC-900527-2021: Three years’ imprisonment (concurrent);

> b.     DAC-900528-2021: Three years’ imprisonment (consecutive);

> c.     DAC-900529-2021: Six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane (concurrent); and

> d.     DAC-900530-2021: Six years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane (consecutive).

> e.     In this case, the first limb of the totality principle would not be helpful in the analysis Ewee

42     Considering the fact that only drug possession and consumption charges had been proceeded with against the accused, I was of the view that a total sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane would be disproportionate in this case and not in accordance with his past record and future prospects. As explained by CJ Menon in _Wong Tian Jun De Beers v PP_ _<span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 273</span>_ at \[68\]:

> 68 Fundamentally, this assessment \[of the totality principle\] centres on identifying an aggregate sentence which is condign to the offender’s behaviour and prospects. The emphasis must be on the aggregate sentence matching and being proportionate to the offending behaviour.

43     I was of the view that it would be sufficient if the mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment was meted out against the accused for each of DAC-900527-2021 and DAC-900528-2021, if the sentences were to run consecutively, considering that the accused was found with the drugs at the same time upon his arrest. This meant that ordering for the sentences in DAC-900527-2021 and DAC-900528-2021 and in DAC-900530-2021 to run consecutively would amount to a global sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. In view of the accused’s previous record and the three TIC charges, the eventual sentence would not be crushing for the accused.

44     Taking a further look at the aggregate sentence, I saw no basis to adjust the aggregate sentence to anything lower than 10 years’ imprisonment imposed as there were no mitigating factors in this case at all. The accused was basically caught red-handed by CNB officers based on intelligence received, negating any mitigatory value his early admission or plea of guilt may have. The financial hardship faced by the accused’s family was not a mitigating factor which the Court could take into account for sentencing as some hardship is to be expected when one chooses to commit crimes and is subsequently apprehended.

45     Given that the accused had spent considerable time in remand, I backdated his sentence to the date of his arrest i.e. 22 June 2020.

46     The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against sentence. He is currently serving his imprisonment sentence.
