Criminal Law – Providing false information to public servant

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9080/2022/01.\]

26 July 2022

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Velda Lim Ming, female, aged 28 years, was convicted after trial on two counts of providing false information to the police. She was sentenced to concurrent sentences of 10 weeks’ imprisonment per charge. She has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence and has been released on bail pending appeal.

## The charges

2       The charges were as follows:-

> **MCN-900148-2020 (Amended 1st charge)**

> are charged that, on 27 May 2019, in Singapore, did provide information to a public servant, _to wit_, you sent a message to a police officer via the “SPF Feedback” facility, stating that you knew that one Dawson Chng and one of his friends were engaged in the import and sale of illegal weapons, which information you knew to be false, intending thereby to cause such public servant to use his lawful power to the annoyance of Dawson Chng, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, Rev. Ed. 2008).

> **MCN-900149-2020 (Amended 2nd charge)**

> are charged that you, on 28 May 2019, in Singapore, did provide information to a public servant, _to wit_, you sent a message to a police officer via the “SPF Feedback” facility, stating that you knew that one Dawson Chng was selling illegal weapons, which information you knew to be false, intending thereby to cause such public servant to use his lawful power to the annoyance of Dawson Chng, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, Rev. Ed. 2008).

## Background facts

3       At the time of the offences, the accused was in a relationship with Dawson Chng Jie Sheng (“Dawson”) (PW3). One of Dawson’s friends was Tan Shen Kang Melvin (“Melvin”) (PW4). The information which the accused provided to the police was in relation to them.

4       The accused’s relationship with Dawson was volatile. According to Dawson, it was unstable and complicated, as both of them were “very easy jealous kind of person”. There were a lot of arguments over friends of the opposite sex.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The accused described the relationship as “very toxic”. She stated that the parties were very insecure towards each other and argued every day. There was jealousy over third parties and physical fights.[^2]

5       At the time of the offences, the accused was jealous that Dawson had gone to Bangkok with her former friend, Jocelyn. She was angry and decided to make a police report against him.

6       She created a new email XXX@gmail.com (“the email account”) which she used when she provided information via the Singapore Police Force (“SPF”) feedback facility on 27 May 2019 (Exhibit P2). She informed the police that:-

> I believe that this person, Dawson Chng, has unauthorized armory located at his house or being placed at one of his friends house. I have a screenshot of him telling me that he has possession of a gun and I know that he and one of his friends has been bringing in illegal weapons and then selling them to others. They are a danger to the community and spreading that danger along with them. Furthermore, he is known to have done other illegal traits in SG and in MSIA with some of his friends that are on the run from the police. Please look him up to prevent such dangers in our community. His address: Clementi West \[full address redacted\] His friend’s address, that does illegal weapon sales: Clementi Ave \[full address redacted\].

7       To support her claims, the accused attached a screenshot of four old messages which Dawson had sent to her via Telegram messaging in December 2018, about five months earlier. These stated, “I give u”, “You want”, “No bullet” and “I got one pistol” (“the pistol messages”).

8       The accused did not disclose her name when providing the information. Instead, she falsely stated that the informant was “Dawson Chng” and provided his NRIC number. She used the Safari incognito mode, so that what she did would not show up in her browser history.

9       She followed up the next day (28 May 2019) as she perceived a lack of urgency by the police. She used the same e-mail account to provide further information through the SPF feedback facility (Exhibit P3):-

> A few days ago, I’ve submitted a report on this person: Dawson Chng Jie Sheng, of having illegal weapons based at his home in Clementi West \[full address redacted\], however nothing has been done as of now. Furthermore, the police is letting such a dangerous person roam around freely in this country? He has been selling off illegal weapons to the people who contacted him, and has been doing other illegal activities but nothing has been done unto him? From what I’ve known is that he got all these weapons from one of his friends which I’ve previously submitted in the report. He carries 3 phones with him and he is currently in Malaysia now with his friends. Please do something about it and keep our community safe from these dangerous people whom was not authorized to keep weapons at home or with them.

10     Once again, she failed to disclose her name. She falsely stated that the informant was “Dawson Chng” and misused his NRIC number. She attached a screenshot of the pistol messages. As before, she used Safari incognito.

11     On 31 May 2019, SI Sim Jia Hui (PW1) of Clementi Police Division was notified of the information contained in Exhibits P2 and P3. After preliminary investigations, she decided to conduct a raid. The raiding party consisted of a large group of about 20 officers as it was alleged that firearms were involved. They began a stakeout at around 3.00 p.m. near Dawson’s unit and detained him when he returned at about 6.00 p.m.. Dawson denied possessing illegal weapons or firearms. The police searched his car and unit. No weapons or anything incriminating were found. Dawson was not arrested but was brought back to the police station for an interview.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

12     On 7 June 2019, a party of about five police officers conducted a raid on Melvin’s residence. No illegal weapons or firearms were found there either. Melvin was not arrested, nor was he brought back to the police station.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

13     During their investigations, the police established that Exhibits P2 and P3 originated from the accused.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) They seized her mobile phone. Messages exchanged via Telegram by the accused and Dawson between 25 May to 28 May 2019 (Exhibit P4) were recovered. In summary, Exhibit P4 showed that the accused was angry with Dawson for going to Bangkok with Jocelyn and other friends, and repeatedly threatened to report him to the police.

## The prosecution’s case

### Dawson’s evidence

14     Dawson testified that the information contained in Exhibits P2 and P3 were untrue. Neither he or any of his friends brought in weapons and sold them.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) He never had a pistol or weapons of any kind and the accused had never seen him with these.[^7] Nor did the accused ever see Melvin and him playing with weapons or being in possession of them. He never discussed anything relating to weapons with Melvin in the presence of the accused.[^8]

15     He sent the pistol messages to the accused as they were quarrelling “over a guy” and he wanted to annoy or irritate her. He felt that when she was angry, “the only way that she will get annoyed or irritated is me doing like a stupid or funny things”. This was a joke. He also sent her a picture of him holding a toy gun which he referred to as a “nerf gun”.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

16     Dawson testified that he did not know that the accused had made a police report. He was caught off-guard by the police raid. After he parked his car, he waited for the lift. When the lift door opened, the officers pinned him to the lift. They asked if he had anything to declare and he said no. They searched his car and took his handphone to check if he had done anything illegal. They then raided his unit.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

### Melvin’s evidence

17     Melvin testified that the contents of Exhibits P2 and P3 were false. He never brought in illegal weapons with Dawson or sold them. He never supplied weapons to Dawson. He never spoke to Dawson about weapons when the accused was present, nor did he possess any weapons. He never spoke to the accused about weapons, nor did he show her any weapons.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

## The case for the defence

### The accused’s evidence

18     In her defence, the accused testified that Dawson had done illegal things on four occasions. On one occasion at Club Envy at “St James Power House” (“the Club Envy incident”), she was with Joselyn (who was then her friend) and another friend, Winnie. She approached some male friends, took a selfie with one of them and had a drink with him. Dawson became jealous. He took out a knife from his pants and wanted to hurt her friend “Benjie”. She sat on top of Dawson to stop him from doing so.[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

19     The accused claimed that on another occasion when they were at Melvin’s unit, Dawson and Melvin played with a metal baton which featured a concealed knife. When they were leaving, she saw Melvin pass a plastic bag containing five or six boxes of brass knuckles and the baton to Dawson.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

20     On the third occasion, the accused claimed that she accompanied Dawson when he sold a set of brass knuckles which he had obtained from Melvin. He picked her up from her home on his motorcycle and went to a car park at Clementi. He then passed a plastic bag with a box to a male person, who opened the box and took out the brass knuckles. This was how she knew that the plastic bag Melvin handed to Dawson contained brass knuckles and that Dawson was selling weapons.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

21     The fourth time Dawson did something illegal was when his friend Daryl was caught by the police (“the Daryl incident”). He was afraid that Daryl would “rat him out”. He then went to buy a new phone with a pre-paid card and sent messages to her. He wondered if he should remove the items from his place as Daryl knew of them. He asked the accused if he could leave the items with her and she said, “Oh, then why not put at my place.”[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

22     She further testified that when she submitted the information contained in Exhibits P2 and P3 to the police, she believed them to be correct.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

## Evaluation of evidence

### The elements of the offence

23     The elements of an offence punishable under s 182 of the Penal Code were set out in _Public Prosecutor v Chua Wen Hao_ and another <span class="citation">\[2021\] 4 SLR 766</span>. Sundaresh Menon, CJ stated at \[19\]:-

> … the Prosecution must show that: (a) the accused person gave information to a public servant; (b) such information was false; (c) the accused person knew or believed that such information was false; and (d) the accused person intended thereby to cause, or knew it to be likely that he or she would thereby cause, the public servant to: (i) use his or her lawful powers to the injury or annoyance of another person; or (ii) do something which he or she ought not to do if the true state of facts were known to him or her; or (iii) omit to do something which he or she ought not to omit if the true state of facts were known to him or her.

24     To discharge its burden of proof, the prosecution had to prove all four elements beyond a reasonable doubt. It was not the burden of the defence to prove that the information provided was true. Of the four elements, the defence only contested elements (b) and (c).[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

25     It was not disputed that the accused provided the information contained in Exhibits P2 and P3 to the police. It was also not in dispute that she intended to cause the police to use their lawful powers against Dawson and Melvin to their annoyance. I was thus of the view that the prosecution had established elements (a) and (d) beyond a reasonable doubt.

26     The live issues which remained were:-

> (a)     Whether the information the accused provided was false (element (b)); and

> (b)     Whether the accused knew or believed that such information was false (element (c)).

### Preliminary issue

27     The defence submitted that the charges were deficient and faulty as they only referred to the import and sale of weapons. It contended that the prosecution had selectively framed the charges since the accused had provided much more information than the alleged false information stated in the charges. It asserted that the prosecution was in effect saying that the portions of Exhibits P2 and P3 which stated that Dawson had an unauthorised armoury were not false, and that the prosecution tacitly accepted that the accused had seen weapons.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18)

28     This submission was fallacious. It is trite that the prosecution has the discretion to frame charges as it sees fit. Further, there was no express or implied admission of any sort by the prosecution. Instead, the prosecution’s case was that Dawson and Melvin did not possess, import, or sell weapons.

### The information provided by the accused was false

#### Dawson and Melvin’s claim that they did not import or sell weapons was compelling

29     Dawson testified that neither Melvin or he imported or sold weapons. He stated that the contents of Exhibits P2 and P3 were not true.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) His evidence was consistent on all material issues and was not shaken in cross-examination. He candidly answered questions posed to him in a straightforward way. When asked if he had done anything illegal, he stated that he had consumed vape. When pressed on whether he had previously been arrested, he stated that he had been arrested once before when he tried to stop a fight. When asked if he knew the accused’s friend “Benji”, he stated that he did, but denied pulling a knife on him.

30     Similarly, Melvin denied that Dawson or he imported and sold illegal weapons.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) His evidence was also consistent on material issues and was not shaken in cross-examination. He truthfully answered questions which were put to him. When asked about his antecedents, he admitted that he had an antecedent for robbery, for which he was granted probation.

31     Dawson and Melvin corroborated each other’s evidence when they testified that neither of them imported or sold weapons. More importantly, their evidence was corroborated by objective evidence.

#### The objective evidence supported Dawson and Melvin’s position

32     I agreed with the prosecution that the contemporaneous exchange of messages between the accused and Dawson (Exhibit P4) supported Dawson’s claim that he did not import or sell weapons or possess a pistol. When the accused threatened, “I am on the verge of reporting you to the police”, Dawson replied, “IDK \[I don’t know\] what you want to report to.” When the accused stated, “YOU GOT GUN AT HOME MAH, NEVER MIND YOU DON’T REMEMBER ITS OKAY ONE”, Dawson replied, “Water gun ah hahaha”.[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21)

33     Based on this exchange, Dawson did not know what the accused wanted to report him for. He had done nothing wrong and was unfazed by her threats. By and large, he did not respond to them. He explained that he did not do so as there was nothing to report him for. His tone was not defensive, as would be expected if he had weapons. Instead, he laughed at her suggestion that he had a gun at home. The accused’s response that it was okay if he did not remember that he had a gun was significant. It showed that she did not believe that he had a gun, since if he did, this would not be something which he would forget. The tenor and tone of the exchanges in Exhibit P4 was a good indicator that Dawson did not have any weapons or a pistol.

34     Further, the police found nothing incriminating when they raided Dawson and Melvin’s units and conducted investigations. Dawson’s claim that he was caught off-guard when the police raided went unchallenged. If he had an armoury (as alleged by the accused), it would have been discovered by the police as he would not have had the time to dispose of his weapons. The fact that no weapons were found objectively proved that he did not have an armoury and that the accused’s claim on this was also untrue. Overall, there was no evidence to link Dawson and Melvin to the import and sale of weapons.

#### The accused’s assertion that Dawson and Melvin disposed of the weapons was pure speculation

35     To explain why the police did not find any illegal weapons at Dawson and Melvin’s units, the accused claimed that they had moved the weapons before the police raided. This was pure speculation.

36     In cross-examination, the accused stated that she made the second report (Exhibit P3) as Dawson went to Malaysia to dispose of the weapons right after he came back from Thailand. She stated:-[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22)

> … I’m so sure that he was trying to bring weapons to hide or like something else (sniffing) or maybe like just bring it somewhere else first.

37     She claimed that he moved the weapons since, “Oh I already reported you. Then after that, you straight away went to --- then after you straight away went to Malaysia”.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) It was clear from this that she did not have any direct knowledge of why Dawson went to Malaysia (if at all), but was quick to level unfounded allegations against him. Even if he went to Malaysia, there was nothing to show that the purpose of his trip was to dispose of weapons. Moreover, it would be totally illogical to risk a border crossing with a supposed cache of weapons when the weapons could have been disposed of in Singapore.

38     The accused similarly speculated on why no weapons were found at Melvin’s unit. She stated:-[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

> … the main point that I involved his friend was because the weapons were placed at his friend’s house. So, if they were to go to Dawson’s house and check first and raid first, after that, it took 1 week plus to go and raid on Melvin’s house. Obviously, the items will be already gone by then.

39     Her claim that Dawson placed his weapons at Melvin’s home was inconsistent with her allegation that Dawson had an armoury in his own home, and that he went to Malaysia to dispose of his weapons. It was also inconsistent with Exhibit P2 where she stated, “Dawson Chng, has unauthorized armory located at his house or being placed at one of his friend’s house.” In Exhibit P2, she only alluded to the possibility of weapons being placed in Melvin’s home, but she testified that her main point was that the weapons were in fact placed there. These inconsistencies were material and showed that the accused was not a witness of truth.

40     When pressed, the accused vacillated on whether her evidence was based on her own speculation:-[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

> Q    So, you are saying this based on your own speculation?

> A    Mmm, correct.

> Q    But the officers ultimately didn’t find any weapon at both houses,---

> A    Yah, if---

> Q    correct?

> A    were---if they were to raid at the same day, I’m pretty sure that the items will be found at Melvin’s house.

> Q    Again, Ms. Lim, your only basis for that is your own speculation, correct?

> A    But I already saw the items were at Melvin’s house.

41     Her claim that she saw illegal weapons in Melvin’s unit was an afterthought. She failed to inform the police of this in Exhibits P2 and P3. In Exhibit P2, she only raised the possibility that Dawson had placed his weapons with Melvin. If her main point was that she had seen weapons there, she should have reported with certainty that there were weapons in Melvin’s home.

#### The accused did not see Dawson with a pistol

42     The accused had never seen Dawson with a pistol and did not have direct knowledge that he had one. According to her, the only time Dawson mentioned a pistol was in the pistol messages. She admitted that this was the only evidence she had to show that Dawson and Melvin imported and sold weapons.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) I will deal with the pistol messages below, in the context of whether the accused knew or believed that Dawson had a pistol. Suffice to say, it could not be inferred from the pistol messages that Dawson had a pistol, and that I found that it unlikely that he had one.

#### The accused’s testimony that Melvin handed Dawson a plastic bag containing weapons and that Dawson sold them was unbelievable

43     The accused testified that she saw Melvin and Dawson playing with a baton. Melvin subsequently handed a plastic bag containing boxes of brass knuckles to Dawson. This was an escalation of her previous claims. She did not mention the baton or brass knuckles in Exhibits P2 and P3. In her police statement (Exhibit P5), she only mentioned the baton, but not the brass knuckles. She stated:-

> I wish to state that I mentioned that Melvin was providing weapons in my email as I had seen him in possession with a baton lookalike object that can be unscrewed at the end revealing a knife which is about a ruler size.

44     The evolving nature of her allegations showed that the accused was embellishing her evidence to suit her case as it progressed. She failed to inform the police that she saw Melvin deliver brass knuckles to Dawson, or that she accompanied Dawson when he made a sale, although these were material facts. Her late claims in court about the brass knuckles were uncorroborated. They were unconvincing and could not be relied on.

#### The accused’s claim that Dawson committed other illegal acts was untrue and irrelevant

45     The accused claimed that during the Club Envy incident, Dawson brandished a knife at her friend Benjie. Dawson denied this. The accused’s account was not supported by any other evidence. While she admitted that there were a lot of people there, no witnesses were called to corroborate her account. The defence did not even call Benji as a witness. As he was the person who was allegedly threatened, his evidence would have been material. It was thus difficult to accept her evidence that the Club Envy incident occurred. Even if it did, it did not prove that Dawson and Melvin imported and sold weapons. It would only show that Dawson possessed a knife.

46     The accused’s haphazard account of how Dawson went into hiding when Daryl was caught as he was afraid that Daryl would “rat him out” was another bare allegation devoid of merit. She did not see Dawson with any weapons. Her account did not support her allegation that Dawson and Melvin imported and sold weapons. The most it would show was that Dawson possessed weapons.

#### Conclusion: the information provided by the accused was false

47     Having considered the evidence in totality, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the information which the accused provided was untrue and that she had provided false information on the terms stated in the charges.

## The accused knew or believed that the information she provided was false

48     The next issue to be considered was whether the accused knew or believed that the information she provided was false. In so doing, the court had to consider all the facts and circumstances of the case.

#### The accused lodged false reports as she was jealous and angry

49     By the accused’s own admission, she had a motive to tell lies about Dawson. She reported him to the police as she was jealous and angry that he had gone to Bangkok with Jocelyn. She stated in her statement to the police (Exhibit P5):-

> Q5)    Do you have anything else to say?

> A5)    I wish to state that it was my anger that triggered my report against Dawson and I had not actually seen him with any pistol. I am sorry for causing so much trouble to the police and I hope that can be given leniency.

50     The accused did not challenge the admissibility of the statement. However, she claimed that she only informed the recorder, Inspector Claire Chiang (PW2), that she made the report as she was angry. She alleged that Inspector Chiang tried to imply that what she said was false by writing words such as “give leniency”.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) Thus, by her own reading, the content of the statement was inculpatory and implied that what she said was false.

51     There was no reason for Inspector Chiang to invent content and attribute it to the accused. The accused read through her statement, appended her signature, and affirmed it to be true and correct. Inspector Chiang testified that the accused was invited to make amendments. Two amendments were made, including an amendment to Dawson’s name when the accused spotted the mistake.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) I therefore rejected the accused’s claim of any impropriety on Inspector Chiang’s part.

#### The accused’s conduct showed that she knew or believed that the information was false

52     The fact that the accused submitted Exhibits P2 and P3 surreptitiously was a factor which weighed against her. It showed that she knew or believed that the information she provided was false. Instead of using her own email account and name, she created a new e-mail account. She lied about the identity of the person providing the information and misused Dawson’s name and NRIC number. She even took the precaution of using the Safari incognito mode so that her browser history could not be traced.

53     The only reason the accused forwarded to explain why she provided the information anonymously was, “… And then the fact that I didn’t want them \[Dawson and his friends\] to hurt my sister or my mother.”[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) This was an absurd claim which defied logic. Her own conduct showed that it was inconceivable that she had these fears. She repeatedly threatened to report Dawson to the police. She wanted him to know that she was going to extract revenge for his infidelity. Under these circumstances, once Dawson found out that a police report had been lodged against him, he would know that the accused would have been responsible for this. I thus rejected her claim that she wanted to remain anonymous because she was afraid of Dawson and his friends.

54     There was no good reason for the accused to take furtive measures to mask her identity if she intended to provide true information to the police. The fact that she resorted to these measures showed that she knew or believed that the information she provided was false.

#### There was no basis for the accused to believe that Dawson and Melvin imported and sold weapons

55     The accused’s purported belief that Dawson and Melvin imported and sold weapons was premised on her claim that Dawson engaged in illegal activity on four occasions. To-reiterate, I did not believe her evidence that Dawson collected brass knuckles from Melvin and later sold a set, or that the Club Envy or Daryl incidents took place. As her evidence on these purported events was concocted and untrue, it would follow that she could not have known or believed that the information she provided was true. Instead, she would have known or believed that the information was false.

56     Even if these incidents took place, they did not show that Dawson and Melvin imported and sold weapons. The accused admitted that even if she had seen Dawson sell brass knuckles, this would be insufficient for her to conclude that he imported weapons for sale.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) She admitted that even if Dawson held a knife at Benjie, this did not support her allegation that he imported and sold weapons.[^31] In my view, the most her narrative could show was that Dawson possessed weapons. It could not form the basis of any belief that Dawson and Melvin imported and sold weapons.

57     As for the pistol messages, Dawson testified that these were meant as a joke. He sent them as he wanted to irritate or annoy the accused. The factual matrix showed that it was inconceivable that the accused believed that Dawson had a pistol.

58     The pistol messages were sent five to six months before the accused provided the false information contained in Exhibits P2 and P3. She stated in her statement to the police (Exhibit P5) that the parties had a dispute over “my guy best friend” Wilson. She stated:-[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32)

> As such Dawson just randomly texted me that he had a pistol at home and whether I want it or not. I then replied no and just continued the argument and there was no mentioning the pistol again.

59     The accused had never seen Dawson with a pistol and the pistol messages were the only basis of her purported belief that he had one. She stated in cross-examination that the pistol messages were “very random” and agreed that she ignored them. She conceded that it would be naïve to believe that Dawson had a pistol based on a single message.[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33) Her purported belief that Dawson had a pistol was thus based on totally inadequate facts.

60     The accused’s conduct was inconsistent with her purported belief that Dawson had a pistol. She did not respond to the pistol messages, but simply ignored them. Her explanation that she did not mention them again as they were arguing about other things was not credible, since she admitted that it was rather alarming to hear that Dawson had a pistol and that it was not something she could ignore.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) Her failure to respond indicated that she did not hold the belief that Dawson had a pistol.

61     To explain the long delay in making a police report against Dawson, the accused stated that she did not report him immediately as Dawson was her partner and she did not want to get him into trouble.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35) This explanation was unsatisfactory, since they were still in a relationship when she eventually reported him.

62     Further, the accused testified that Dawson had threatened to shoot Wilson and Tai Tiang, who were her male friends, and that she genuinely believed that Dawson would do so. Wilson was her best male friend, and she should have been concerned about his safety. However, she failed to warn him about Dawson’s threat. Nor did she warn Tai Tiang. Her explanation that she failed to do so as she did not want them to report Dawson to the police[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) was unacceptable. She could have warned them in general terms without telling them that Dawson had a pistol. She could also have told them not to make a report against him. The fact that she did not treat the purported threat seriously showed that she did not believe that Dawson had a pistol with which he could shoot her friends.

63     In my view, the facts and circumstances showed that the accused did not know or believe that Dawson had a pistol. Even if he had one, this did not mean that he imported and sold weapons.

#### Conclusion: the accused knew or believed that the information she provided was false

64     Having considered the evidence in totality, I found that the prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew or believed that the information she provided to the police was false.

### Conviction

65     For the reasons aforesaid, I was satisfied and found that the prosecution had discharged its burden of proving both charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused was therefore found guilty and convicted as charged.

## Sentence

### Sentencing principles

66     The prescribed punishment for an offence of providing false information to a public servant, punishable under s 182 of the Penal Code, is a term of imprisonment which may extend to one year, or with a fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both.

67     The dominant sentencing consideration would be general deterrence. I did not accept the submission that rehabilitation was the dominant consideration and that a probation report should be called for. The accused was already 25 years old when she offended out of spite and vengeance. She displayed no remorse and elected to claim trial. She never recanted on her false statements. In my view, probation was not a viable sentencing option.

### Mandatory Treatment Order was not suitable

68     By way of background, the accused had pleaded guilty before another court on 26 January 2021, after her case had been fixed for trial. The court called for a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) suitability report.

69     The appointed psychiatrist, Dr Lee Yu Wei, Consultant Psychiatrist, Institute of Mental Health (“Dr Lee”), stated in the MTO suitability report dated 19 May 2021 that the accused had Persistent Depressive Disorder (“PDD”). In his opinion, there was no contributory link between her psychiatric condition and the alleged offences. As such, she was not a suitable candidate for an MTO.

70     When her case came up for mitigation and sentencing on 20 May 2021, the court found that the accused had retracted her plea in the MTO suitability report and set aside her conviction. The case was subsequently fixed for trial before this court.

### Calibration of Sentence

71     The prosecution submitted for a sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with the sentences to run concurrently. The defence submitted that if the court was not minded to grant probation, a custodial sentence of 5 to 10 days’ imprisonment should be imposed.

72     In _Koh Yong Chiah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 3 SLR 447</span>, Chao Hick Tin, JA, delivering the judgment of the empanelled court, stated at \[50\]:-

> 50    In our view, whether the custodial threshold is crossed should essentially be determined based on the degree of harm caused or likely to be caused by the s 182 offence. As the High Court in CLB observed at \[9\], “the \[sentencing\] norm must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, in particular, the mischief that might be caused by the false information” \[emphasis added\]. Specifically, if appreciable harm may be caused by the s 182 offence, the courts should, as a starting point, impose a custodial term. The range of harm that may ensue includes personal injury (eg, by causing another to contract HIV), loss of liberty (eg, by causing another to be unjustifiably arrested), financial loss (eg, by lying to facilitate the misappropriation of property or to commit insurance fraud) or harm arising from the wastage of public investigative resources.

73     In the present case, the custodial threshold had been crossed as appreciable harm was caused. Serious allegations were made against Dawson and Melvin. Significant public resources were wasted to follow up on the false information the accused provided, including dispatching large teams of police officers to conduct raids. Although Dawson and Melvin were not placed under arrest, they had undoubtedly suffered.

74     The accused’s culpability was high. The offences were planned and pre-meditated. She created a new email account, lied about the identity of the informant, and used the Safari incognito mode to avoid detection. She made the false allegations maliciously. She wanted to extract revenge on Dawson and used the police as her tool. She was persistent. When she perceived that the police were not acting, she sent Exhibit P3, urging them to act.

75     In her favour, the accused had no antecedents. There were however no other significant mitigating factors.

76     The defence psychiatrist, Dr Munidasa Winslow, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist, Winslow Clinic, stated in his report dated 21 April 2021 that the accused suffered from PDD and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”), and that the combination of her two conditions would likely have a contributory link to her act of making the reports.[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37) Dr Winslow stopped short of stating that the accused’s condition contributed to her offending. Instead, he only referred to “her act of reporting”. He made no reference as to whether her mental condition caused or contributed to her concocting the false information. His position was reasonable as the accused had in effect denied committing the offences when he interviewed her, and he would not have been able to assess whether her mental condition caused or contributed to her offending.

77     There was no reason to doubt the opinion of Dr Lee, the appointed psychiatrist. He stated unequivocally in his MTO suitability report that there was no contributory link between the accused’s psychiatric condition and the offences. In his opinion:-[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

> Although people who suffer from PDD may have difficulty with decision making, PDD does not cause or contribute to the sufferer giving false information to others. Velda had well considered the implications of reporting Dawson to the police …

78     In view of the above, I was not able to place any weight on the accused’s mental condition as I was not satisfied that it caused or contributed to her offending.

79     A sentence of 5 to 10 days’ imprisonment (which the defence submitted for), was unrealistic in view of the accused’s culpability and the harm caused. In his oral submissions, counsel merely tendered a newspaper report relating to one Freddy Kosman Kwee, where the offender falsely reported that his partner had drugged and raped him. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five days’ imprisonment. In submitting this report, counsel was not even aware that the offender had been remanded for a period before sentence was passed. I did not consider this case to be helpful.

80     The prosecution’s sentencing table painted a more realistic picture.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) In _Rajeshwary d/o Batumalai v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 153</span> (“_Rajeshwary_”), the untraced offender pleaded guilty to an offence of making a false report. She falsely reported that her stepfather stole her jewellery when she allowed him to pawn the items. She did so as he failed to return some money which he owed her. This led to the arrest of her stepfather. She recanted on her false statement about four and a half months later. The offender was sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment, but this was reduced on appeal to six weeks.

81     Unlike _Rajeshwary_ who pleaded guilty, no sentencing discount could be extended to the accused. The sentence imposed should be higher that the six weeks imposed in _Rajeshwary_. Taking into account the aggravating and mitigating factors, I assessed that sentence should be eight weeks’ imprisonment per charge. The accused faced two charges. As I intended to run both sentences concurrently (as per the parties’ submissions), I adjusted the sentences for the individual charges upwards by two weeks’ imprisonment. The sentence imposed was thus 10 weeks’ imprisonment per charge, with the sentences to run concurrently.

82     Overall, I was of the view that a global sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment was just and proportional to the offences committed.
