2       The Accused filed an appeal against conviction only.

## The Prosecution’s Case

3       Prosecution described this case as a “_classic hit and run_”[^1]. This case involved an accident between a vehicle and a pedestrian which took place at the signalized junction of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh by Lorong 1 Toa Payoh.

4       A sketch plan of the scene was admitted in evidence as Exhibit P1 through PW1 SSSgt Raziz Bin Tahar. On the stand, based on his investigations, SSSgt Raziz explained that the red arrows on the sketch plan represented the vehicle that was driven by the Accused, and that the yellow arrows represented the victim who was crossing along the signalized pedestrian crossing. The Accused’s vehicle was making a right turn from Lorong 2 Toa Payoh into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, and the victim was crossing from the Accused’s right to left. After the collision, the victim landed on the right of 3 lanes along Lorong 1 Toa Payoh towards Lorong 6 Toa Payoh[^2]. Photographs of the accident scene were also tendered as Exhibit P2.

5       The main evidence of the Prosecution’s case came from PW2 Tan Hua Kwee. He was the driver of a vehicle travelling behind the Accused’s vehicle on the day in question and he was an eyewitness of the accident.

### PW2 Tan Hua Kwee

6       PW2 Mr Tan Hua Kwee (“Mr Tan”) testified that on 4 November 2017, he was on his way home to Yishun after dinner with his family (his wife and son) when he “_witnessed an accident at the traffic light_”. In his own words, he described: “_It was green light and the vehicle in front did not stop. And there was this person who had the right of way, and the vehicle in front knocked into the person on the right side. I was right behind, I was the second vehicle_”[^3]. There was no dispute that the vehicle in front, a blue Suzuki, was the Accused’s vehicle.

7       Elaborating on the evening’s events, Mr Tan stated that he was driving along the rightmost lane of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh by Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, behind the Accused’s car as they approached the traffic junction after 7 pm on the day in question. There were no cars in front of the Accused’s vehicle at that time. Mr Tan testified that as they approached the junction on the turning lane, the traffic light was green in their favour. As such, the cars were still “_going ahead_”[^4] and Mr Tan’s vehicle followed behind the Accused’s vehicle to make the right turn.

8       From his view, Mr Tan noticed a pedestrian, crossing the road on a green man, carrying an umbrella as it was drizzling. The pedestrian was not running[^5]. It was Mr Tan’s evidence that the Accused’s vehicle “_was moving slowly forward and the…pedestrian was walking ahead. The person had the right of way and then the collision happened_”[^6]. The pedestrian fell down and lost consciousness.

9       After the collision, Mr Tan testified that the Accused’s vehicle moved and turned slowly into a carpark on the left side of the road, located at Block 107 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh[^7]. Mr Tan continued to follow behind the Accused’s vehicle and turned into the carpark as well. Thereafter, the Accused’s vehicle stopped. Mr Tan then noticed the Accused come out of the vehicle. He (the Accused) took a look in the direction of the accident scene and then drove off from the carpark. It was at this carpark that Mr Tan took a photograph of the Accused’s vehicle number. Subsequently, Mr Tan parked his car and thereafter went to the location of the accident scene to render assistance to the pedestrian. He also helped to guide traffic away from the accident site. About five minutes later, the ambulance and the police arrived at the scene. Mr Tan then showed the police the photograph of the Accused’s vehicle number which he had taken. By the time the matter came to trial, Mr Tan had already deleted the photograph.

### PW3 Kamachi d/o Ramamoorthy

10     The fact that an accident had taken place on 4 November 2017 at the location described by Mr Tan was corroborated by the evidence of a passer-by, PW3 Madam Kamachi d/o Ramamoorthy (“Mdm Kamachi”), a housewife.

11     Mdm Kamachi was walking along the walkway shown in the second photograph in Exhibit P4 near Braddell MRT station, towards the traffic light junction on her way to meet her son when she heard a loud noise “_bang_”[^8]. She headed towards the traffic light junction where the sound came from and upon doing so, she saw a Chinese lady on the floor. Mdm Kamachi described that the lady was wearing a pair of spectacles and was carrying a bag and an umbrella which was opened[^9]. The lady was unconscious at the time when Mdm Kamachi attended to her[^10]. Shortly after, the ambulance and the police arrived.

12     At the accident site, Mdm Kamachi testified that she encountered a couple – husband and wife who informed her that they saw the vehicle who hit the lady[^11]. Under cross-examination, she elaborated that the couple parked their vehicle after they had followed the vehicle that hit the pedestrian. The “_uncle_” who spoke to her at the scene, informed her that “_he was behind the car”._ She added that _“he never stopped, he just go but the uncle went to the car park, parked his car and he came…..he also was helping_”[^12].

13     Even though she could not recall the time of the incident, Mdm Kamachi remembered that it was evening; it was “_not so dark_” and the lights at the junction were switched on[^13]. She did not see the accident happen because a van was blocking her view.

### PW4 Chia Hong Lian

14     PW4 Chia Hong Lian (“Mdm Chia”) was the victim involved in the accident. As described by the Prosecution in their closing submissions[^14], Mdm Chia testified that on 4 November 2017, she had attended mass at 6 pm which would have ended by about 7 pm. After mass, Mdm Chia walked home. Her usual route home involved taking “_the junction of the Braddell MRT crossing_”[^15], which she confirmed to be the junction depicted in the photographs in Exhibit P2. 4 November 2017 was not any different and Mdm Chia remembered being at the junction after attending mass.

15     Unfortunately, in court, Mdm Chia could not recall details of how the accident happened. What she did remember was waking up at the hospital and being told that she had been knocked down. She was unable to remember the weather at the time of the accident but confirmed that she was carrying a bag when she left church. She also testified that she would usually bring a small umbrella in her bag in case of rain.

16     As a result of the accident, Mdm Chia suffered multiple injuries, including a fracture; she had to undergo X-rays and MRI scans. She testified that the injuries were mainly on her left side of the body. In the medical report (Exhibit P6), Mdm Chia was hospitalized from 3 November 2017 to 7 November 2017 and discharged with hospitalization leave from 4 November 2017 to 8 December 2017.

## The Defence’s Case

17     The Accused did not dispute that he was the driver of the blue Suzuki SGJ 7251K which was at the Lorong 2 Toa Payoh by Lorong 1 Toa Payoh at the material time.

18     He testified that he was travelling on the outer lane which leads to the centre lane of Lorong 1 Toa Payoh at about 7:35pm[^16]. He was certain that he was on that lane as he intended to head to Block 107 to withdraw some money from the POSB Automated Teller Machine (ATM) located at the said block. Before he made the right turn from Lorong 2 Toa Payoh into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, the Accused testified that he checked his blind spot towards his right and ensured that it was safe to move forward. He negotiated the right turn at about 25kmph after the light turned green. After he made the right turn into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, he signaled to enter the extreme left lane and then made a left turn into Block 107, intending to make a withdrawal from the POSB ATM. However, when he was searching for his ATM card in the car, he was unable to find it. Upon realising so, he left Block 107 and proceeded to Junction 8 to pick his wife up.

19     As far as the Accused was concerned, he did not get into any accident[^17]. If he had been involved in any accident, he would have stopped the car and rendered assistance to the victim[^18]. There was also no possibility that he could have knocked somebody down but did not know about it[^19]. In respect of traffic conditions, Accused testified that the traffic at the junction was moderate; he was able to see cars in front of him and beside him. He confirmed it was drizzling at the material time. To him, lighting was poor and visibility was low but he was able to see what he was doing.

## Main Issue

20     The main issue in this case is whether the Accused had collided into the pedestrian PW 4 Chia Hong Lian when he failed to keep a proper look out as he was making a right turn at the junction of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh leading into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh. If the Accused caused the collision and was aware of it, the questions that follow were whether:

> (a)     he had failed to stop after the accident; and

> (b)     whether he had failed to render assistance.

## Court’s Findings on the Evidence

### An accident did occur

21     The fact that an accident did occur at the signalized junction of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh by Lorong 1 Toa Payoh at that material time is incontrovertible. This is the sum total of the evidence of the Prosecution’s witnesses i.e. PW2 Mr Tan Hua Kwee, PW3 Mdm Kamachi and PW4 the victim, Mdm Chia Hong Lian herself. It was undisputed that none of these Prosecution witnesses were known to the Accused prior to 4 November 2017[^20]. I agree with the Prosecution[^21] that Mr Tan and Mdm Kamachi were good Samaritans who helped the victim Mdm Chia that day. They also took time to attend court to testify of what they had seen and heard. Their evidence remained unshaken and consistent with each other under cross-examination.

22     Other than Mr Tan’s evidence which I shall deal with shortly, Mdm Kamachi testified that on 4 November 2017, she was along the walkway of Braddell MRT when she heard a loud “_bang_” which subsequently led her to attend to a lady unconscious at the pedestrian crossing which was just ahead. It was clear from the photograph Exhibit P2-1 where the walkway was in relation to the pedestrian crossing. Given her position at the material time, it was entirely possible for her to have heard the sound of a vehicle knocking a pedestrian down. In fact, it was the sound she heard that led her to the pedestrian crossing and eventually to the victim whom she found lying on the ground, still holding on to an opened umbrella. In her evidence, Mdm Kamachi testified of the same scenes described by Mr Tan in the aftermath of the accident – how traffic was being directed away from where the victim was, and the fact that the ambulance and the police arrived shortly after. She also informed the court that it was drizzling at the material time.

23     The accident having occurred at the signalized junction of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh by Lorong 1 Toa Payoh was rendered beyond dispute by the fact that there was an actual victim involved. Even though she was unable to recall the accident itself, Mdm Chia testified of matters which were consistent with her being involved in an accident. The last thing she remembered was that she was at that particular pedestrian crossing along Lorong 1 Toa Payoh after her mass. It was her usual route home after mass. The next thing she remembered was waking up and finding herself in the hospital.

24     Mdm Chia testified that she had injuries consisting of lacerations and bruises, mostly on her left side of her body[^22]. The medical report (Exhibit P6) revealed a fracture on her left clavicle and an upper left lung contusion. The position of most of the injuries suffered by Mdm Chia on her left were consistent with Mr Tan’s account that the Accused’s vehicle had knocked into a pedestrian who was crossing from the Accused’s right to left, causing the pedestrian to fall. The fact that she had, in the words of the Defence “_undocumented injuries_”[^23] did not detract from the fact that she was the victim of a road traffic accident, based on the evidence adduced in this case.

25     Given the evidence from PW3 Mdm Kamachi and PW4 Mdm Chia, along with PW2 Mr Tan’s testimony of what he had personally witnessed, I had no trouble finding that an accident did take place at the signalized junction of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh by Lorong 1 Toa Payoh on 4 November 2017 in the evening. The more pertinent question was: who caused the accident?

### The Accused was Responsible for the Accident

#### Evidence of PW2 Tan Hua Kwee

26     The key witness in this case was undoubtedly PW2 Tan Hua Kwee. He was the driver of the vehicle travelling behind the Accused’s vehicle at the material time and an eyewitness to the accident.

27     The crux of his evidence was on the day in question, as he was travelling behind the Accused’s vehicle which mas making the right turn into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh as shown in the sketch plan (Exhibit P1), the Accused’s vehicle failed to stop for a pedestrian who was crossing the road. Mr Tan testified that the Accused’s vehicle knocked into the pedestrian, causing her to fall. After the accident, the Accused’s vehicle turned slowly into the carpark of Block 107. Mr Tan’s vehicle followed behind and stopped behind the Accused’s vehicle at the carpark.

28     At the carpark, Mr Tan testified that he observed the Accused coming out of his vehicle, “_took a look and then he left_”[^24]. During cross-examination, Mr Tan confirmed several times that the Accused was looking at the accident site[^25], and appeared nervous[^26]. At the carpark, Mr Tan also took down the vehicle number of the Accused’s car by taking a photograph of the Accused’s car. Thereafter, he proceeded to render assistance at the accident location.

29     Having heard and assessed Mr Tan’s testimony, I found him to be a credible witness. His account of what he claimed to have witnessed as he was travelling home from dinner on an otherwise normal day, was clear, coherent and logical. He was straightforward in his description of what he had observed as the driver of the vehicle behind the Accused’s vehicle. His answers to questions under cross-examination were not contrived in any manner and his evidence remained unshaken under cross-examination. I did not find his evidence to contain any material inconsistencies.

30     Mr Tan was also clear in relating how he followed the Accused into the carpark, took a photograph of the Accused’s vehicle and the role he played in the aftermath of the accident in terms of directing traffic at the scene and furnishing the Accused’s vehicle number to the police. PW1 SSSgt Raziz testified that based on the vehicle number, he was able to find out where the owner of the vehicle resided. SSSgt Raziz himself went down to the address and took photographs of the Accused’s vehicle[^27].

#### Internal and External Consistency

31     In his submissions. Defence submitted that there were several inconsistencies in Mr Tan’s evidence.

32     Defence submitted that Mr Tan’s evidence was inconsistent in respect of whether the traffic light was showing green or red as the Accused and Mr Tan’s vehicles were approaching the junction[^28]. I did not find this to be material. From the proceedings in court, it was clear that the state of the lights at the junction were peripheral to the on-going discussion as to the position of Mr Tan’s vehicle in relation to the Accused’s vehicle. In this respect, Mr Tan maintained several times in the course of questioning by Defence that there was no vehicle in front of the Accused’s vehicle; the Accused’s vehicle was the first vehicle and his was the second[^29]. In any case, regardless of the colour of the traffic light as they were driving down Lorong 2 Toa Payoh, it subsequently became clear that both the Accused and Mr Tan’s vehicles did not come to a complete stop at the junction before they both made the right turn[^30] on a green light. This was in fact confirmed by the Accused himself who testified that he had “_reduced \[his\] speed_” before he made the right turn[^31].

33     Defence further submitted that Mr Tan’s description of the accident was “_inherently impossible_” since it would not have been possible for the victim to have reached the divider faster or about the same time as the Accused’s vehicle, given the speed of the vehicle and the pedestrian’s pace of walking[^32]. In making this submission, Defence had relied on certain presuppositions. One, he assumed that the pedestrian “green man” had come on at the same time when the traffic light at the junction turned green for vehicles. Two, he assumed that the Accused’s vehicle had moved off from the traffic light junction at the precise time when the light turned green.

34     On the evidence, there was no basis for either of the presuppositions. There was no expert or technical evidence adduced of the timing of the traffic lights at Lorong 2 Toa Payoh or the pedestrian crossings at the junction. There was no evidence that the pedestrian “green man” would have come on at the same time as the green lights in favour of the vehicles making the right turn. Further, as mentioned before, there was evidence that the Accused had not come to a total stop at the traffic junction but had only reduced his speed before making the right turn. Hence, it was not clear how long the traffic light had already been green for before the Accused’s vehicle negotiated the right turn. I did not find Mr Tan’s evidence to be “_inherently impossible_” or contradicted by objective evidence.

35     I was unable to accept the Defence’s added contention that Mr Tan had concocted a story about how the oncoming vehicles (as opposed to vehicles coming from the junction where the Accused and him had made the right turn from) had compelled him to drive into the carpark after the collision[^33]. Apart from the fact that Mr Tan had no reason to concoct such a story, it was also clear from his evidence that he had turned into the carpark in a bid to follow the Accused’s vehicle, to be able to render assistance and also because there were many vehicles behind[^34]. I did not consider it material as to which direction the vehicles had come from. At a junction such as this, it would be reasonable to expect that there would be vehicles who would be approaching the accident site as soon as the lights turned green in their favour.

36     Defence questioned Mr Tan’s evidence in relation to the victim’s position on the road as she fell and submitted that it was different from what PW1 SSSgt Raziz and PW3 Mdm Kamachi had described. In the first place, SSSgt Raziz was not present at the scene on the actual day of the accident. All that he knew of the case was what was narrated to him by witnesses. Hence, his knowledge of the facts of the case were not first-hand. I was careful to place his evidence and his markings on the sketch plan in perspective.

37     I did not find Mr Tan’s evidence inconsistent with Mdm Kamachi’s evidence, as put forward by Defence. Both of them confirmed that the victim was lying on the road after the accident, not on the divider. In my mind, the position the victim was found in was not as important as the fact that each of them had separately encountered an injured person at the same pedestrian crossing that day. The position of the victim on the road per se did not render the occurrence of a collision in the manner described by Mr Tan, impossible. In any case, without an expert’s reconstruction of the accident, it would also be highly speculative to say how the victim should have fallen and the final position she should have been in, given the evidence of Mr Tan as to how the accident had occurred.

38     What was more significant about Mr Tan’s evidence was that it was corroborated by Mdm Kamachi’s account that an accident had taken place at the pedestrian crossing, Mdm Kamachi testified that at the accident scene, she met a couple - husband and wife[^35] who had parked their car near Block 107 and then came to help. She stated that this same couple who “_was following the car_” was also told to make a police report[^36]. Even though Mdm Kamachi was not asked to identify Mr Tan in court to confirm that he was the “_husband_” or “_uncle_” she was referring to, it was reasonable to deduce from her evidence that Mr Tan was the person she had encountered at the accident scene that day. As mentioned, the same scenes after the accident were described by both Mr Tan and Mdm Kamachi; their accounts were largely consistent with each other.

39     Defence submitted that the reason why Mr Tan was not able to point out which part of the vehicle collided with the victim and how the victim had fallen was because he did not witness any collision. I could not accept the submission. In answer to Defence counsel’s question, Mr Tan testified that it was the right-portion of the Accused’s vehicle which had hit the victim; it was the driver’s side[^37]. As to how the victim had fallen, I agree with the Prosecution[^38] that Mr Tan was candid when he admitted that he would not “_be able to see exactly_” how the victim had fallen down as his vehicle was behind and because there was the pressure of other vehicles coming from behind[^39]. Nonetheless, it was clear from his evidence that Mr Tan saw the victim fall as a result of the Accused’s vehicle colliding into her.

40     Even if his evidence was unclear, I did not find it troubling that Mr Tan was unable to state exactly how the Accused collided into the victim, which part of the right side of the vehicle was in contact with the victim or how the victim fell. Apart from the fact that the accident happened some years back, in the nature of a traffic accident, events may also have taken place very abruptly as the Accused and Mr Tan’s vehicles were making the right turn.

41     In assessing a witnesses’ testimony, it is accepted that allowances must be made for human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection. I did not find Mr Tan’s inability to provide fine details of the accident in the terms required by Defence, to affect his credibility or the reliability of his evidence. On the contrary, Mr Tan was steadfast in maintaining that he witnessed the Accused’s vehicle knocking into the victim on the day in question[^40].

42     Without an expert’s reconstruction of the accident, there was also no basis for the Defence to submit[^41] that it should have been the front of the Accused’s vehicle which should have collided with the left side of the victim. It cannot also be argued that after the turn, the driver’s side would have been facing the front of the victim and not the left side of the victim. All these were highly speculative on the part of the Defence and unsubstantiated on the evidence.

#### No motive to frame the Accused

43     Importantly, Mr Tan was an independent witness of the accident. There was no reason for him to falsely implicate the Accused and to make him responsible for the accident if he did not personally witness it. As mentioned, the Accused himself accepts that he did not know Mr Tan prior to the accident. When asked by his own counsel what incentive Mr Tan would have to lie against him, the Accused had no answer, other than suggesting inadequacies in Mr Tan’s account[^42].

44     Having assessed the evidence of Mr Tan, I was satisfied that he was an honest witness and his evidence was safe to rely on.

### The Accused had collided into the victim when he failed to keep a proper look out as he was making a right turn at the signalized junction

45     I find that the Accused did collide into the victim PW4 Chia Hong Lian as he was making a right turn into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh. The circumstances surrounding the accident lead me to the irresistible inference that the Accused had failed to keep a proper lookout which resulted in him colliding into the victim as he was making the right turn.

46     According to PW2 Mr Tan, there were no other vehicles in front of the Accused’s vehicle. From his position as the driver of the vehicle behind the Accused’s vehicle, Mr Tan testified that he was able to see the pedestrian walking slowly and holding the umbrella as it was raining. Despite the rain, his evidence was that he was able to see the pedestrian. The junction was “_rather bright_”[^43] at that time; “_there were lights all around and we could see_”[^44]. The Accused himself agreed that the junction was well-lit at the time of the accident[^45]. Since Mr Tan, being the driver in the vehicle behind the Accused’s vehicle could see the victim crossing the road, the Accused who was in the vehicle in front, would have had an even better view of the victim crossing the road. There was no way the Accused could not have seen the pedestrian as she was crossing from his right to left. In this instance, the victim Mdm Chia was wearing light coloured apparel[^46] and was carrying an umbrella, both of which would have further highlighted her presence along the pedestrian crossing. Given the setting of the scene, it was not possible that the Accused could not have seen her if he had kept a proper lookout.

47     On the evidence, it was clear that the Accused had failed to keep a proper look out when making a right turn which resulted in his vehicle colliding into the victim who was crossing the road. This was a pedestrian crossing. The Accused was obliged as a motorist to proceed slowly, look out for pedestrians and to give way to them before safely moving ahead. Yet, the Accused drove his vehicle, made the right turn and collided into the victim who was crossing the road. I was satisfied that by so doing, the Accused had driven dangerously.

### The Accused had failed to render assistance as was reasonably in his power to render and did fail to stop after the accident

48     I was also satisfied that the Accused was aware of the accident. The Accused’s claim that he did not cause any accident at the junction and that he did not know that he had caused any such accident was against the weight of the evidence adduced through independent witnesses.

49     From Mr Tan’s position as the driver of the second vehicle behind the Accused’s vehicle, he could see clearly that the Accused’s vehicle had knocked into the victim, causing her to fall. Again, since Mr Tan was able to see that, it would be impossible for the Accused not to have noticed that he had knocked into the victim. Further, Mdm Kamachi testified that she heard a loud noise, “_bang_”[^47]. It was a sound loud enough to catch her attention and draw her in the direction where it came from i.e. the pedestrian crossing. From her evidence, it appeared that the impact between the vehicle and the pedestrian was of some force. Even if the Accused claimed that he did not hear anything, being the driver in control of a vehicle which had collided into a pedestrian which resulted in a loud “_bang_” sound heard by a passer-by, it is likely he must have felt a certain impact when in the vehicle. The Accused’s evidence that “_there wasn’t any impact_” was incredible[^48].

50     The fact of his knowledge and direct involvement in the accident was compounded by the undisputed evidence that after the accident had occurred, the Accused drove his vehicle to the carpark at Block 107. According to Mr Tan’s evidence which I accept, the Accused drove into the carpark at Block 107, exited from his vehicle, looked at the accident scene and then left the scene. At this time, the Accused was observed by Mr Tan to be “_looking nervous and he left in a hurry_”[^49]. At that point, even if not earlier, the Accused must have seen a pedestrian lying on the ground and confirmed that he had caused an accident. The Accused’s knowledge of what had happened as he was making the right turn, and possibly even an experience of guilt arising from what he had done, was manifested in his nervousness and resulted in him leaving the scene in a hurry. In so doing, the Accused failed to stop after the accident and also failed to render assistance when it was clearly within his power to do so.

51     I could not accept the Accused’s reason for turning into the carpark at Block 107. The Accused claimed that he wanted to withdraw money from the ATM located at Block 107 but subsequently realised that he did not have his ATM card with him. The Accused testified that he did not even get down from his vehicle as he realised he did not have his ATM card in his wallet[^50]. Hence, he drove off from the carpark.

52     I found this to be a convenient story. The Accused was en route to a mall to meet his wife and there did not seem to be any immediate or urgent need for him to have made an extra stop at Block 107 just to withdraw money. Further, if the Accused had planned to withdraw money from Block 107, it would also have been reasonable for his vehicle to be travelling on the leftmost turning lane towards Lorong 1 Toa Payoh so as to facilitate an easy left turn into the carpark, bearing in mind how close the entrance into the carpark of Block 107 was after the right turn. However, Mr Tan testified that the Accused’s vehicle was travelling on the rightmost turning lane at the material time, and in effect, he would have had to traverse two lanes before he could make the quick left turn into the carpark of Block 107. In my view, the position of the Accused’s vehicle on the rightmost turning lane of Lorong 2 Toa Payoh leading into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh indicated that the Accused likely did not have the intention to turn into the carpark at Block 107 prior to making the right turn into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh. On the evidence, the decision of the Accused to turn into the carpark of Block 107 appeared to be a sudden one on the part of the Accused. This gelled with the Prosecution’s case that the Accused had driven into the carpark at Block 107 to check out the accident scene before fleeing.

53     It should also be mentioned that the position of the Accused’s vehicle being on the rightmost turning lane was not challenged by the Defence when the Prosecution witnesses were on the stand. The Accused’s assertion that he was travelling on the leftmost turning lane only surfaced when he was on the stand and appeared to be an afterthought in order to substantiate his account that he had turned into the carpark of Block 107 to withdraw money from the ATM.

54     More importantly, the Accused’s version that he had turned into the carpark at Block 107 to withdraw money from the ATM was never put to Mr Tan. The Accused’s claim that he did not even get down from the vehicle at the carpark of Block 107 was similarly never put to Mr Tan when he was on the stand. A perusal of the cross-examination of Mr Tan surrounding this aspect of the evidence revealed that the questions were concerned with establishing that Mr Tan did not know for a fact why the Accused had gone into the carpark of Block 107, why the Accused got out of the car, what he was looking at and why he left the carpark[^51]. It was never the Defence’s position that the Accused had remained in the car, looking for his ATM card before realising that it was not in the wallet and then driving off. The explanation of wanting to withdraw money from the ATM as a reason for turning into the carpark at Block 107 only surfaced during the Accused’s evidence-in-chief. The production of a January 2017 bank statement (Exhibit D1) evidencing that he had withdrawn money from the same ATM located at Block 107 before did not strengthen the Accused’s explanation. I found the Accused’s version of events in this respect to be a clear afterthought. I did not believe the Accused.

## Rejection of the Accused’s Account

55     I could not accept the Accused’s account of events.

56     Apart from the unsatisfactory portions of his evidence discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, I found the Accused’s testimony to be essentially self-serving in nature. His evidence during examination-in-chief that it was “_thundery showers with dark skies_”, “_strong gusty winds_”, “_heavy rain, heavy droplets falling from the sky_” when he reached Toa Payoh, that visibility was low with the “_wiper on…to the highest level_” [^52] were exaggerated, with a view to mitigating any blameworthiness on his part. None of the Prosecution witnesses testified to similar weather conditions. Under cross-examination, the Accused subsequently admitted that there was no heavy rain as he approached the junction[^53]. Further, as earlier mentioned, the Accused’s claims that he was travelling on the leftmost turning lane; that he wanted to withdraw money from the ATM located at Block 107 were all raised by the Accused for the first time during evidence-in-chief. These were never put to Mr Tan by the defence when Mr Tan was on the stand. I did not find the Accused’s version of events believable.

57     The Accused’s claim that it was impossible that he had an accident with the pedestrian or knew nothing about it was contradicted by the contents of his own police report. In his police report (Exhibit P7), he alluded to facts which showed knowledge on his part that his vehicle may have hit a pedestrian. In the police report, he stated: “….. _I was pretty sure that my vehicle did not hit on anything on the front of my vehicle which if I did, I will definitely be alerted of. I believe the accident is caused by a "brush through hit" on the side of my vehicle from the incoming pedestrian from the side which caused the accident that I had neglected not being aware of at that time. I was alerted from a phone call from officer Aziz of the accident later_”. If the Accused was certain that no accident had happened and that it was not possible for him to have knocked somebody down without him knowing as he testified in court, he could have simply stated in the police report that he did not cause any accident. The Accused confirmed that nobody had told him what to say in his police report[^54]. His explanation that he was in a “_complete dilemma of what actually happened_” and that the police report made was “_only based on an assumption_”[^55] was weak and a convenient one. The contents in the police report were revealing of what was in the mind of the Accused.

58     On the evidence I was satisfied that the Accused knew that he had knocked into the pedestrian as he was making the right turn. Even if the Accused was unsure if he had been involved in an accident at that precise time when he was making the right turn, any such doubt would have been eradicated when he turned his vehicle into the carpark at Block 107, stepped out of the vehicle and looked at the accident scene. He would have seen the victim lying on the ground and surmised what had happened. A person in the Accused’s shoes, seeking to be responsible for his actions, would have parked his car, walked to the accident site and offered assistance to the injured pedestrian, not flee the scene as the Accused did.

59     Overall, the evidence offered in defence by the Accused did not cast a reasonable doubt on the Prosecution’s case. The credible testimonies of eye-witness Mr Tan, passer-by Mdm Kamachi and the victim herself, Mdm Chia, all painted a consistent and coherent picture of the events which had taken place on the evening of 4 November 2017. I was satisfied that they were telling the truth; the Accused’s version of events did not throw doubt on their evidence.

## Conclusion

60     Having considered the totality of the evidence and the strength of the Prosecution’s case, I was satisfied that that Prosecution had proven their charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore convicted the Accused on all three charges.
