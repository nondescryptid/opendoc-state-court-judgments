Tort – Negligence – Breach of duty

Tort – Negligence – Contributory negligence

18 January 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Lim Mei Yee Elaine:

1       On 23 October 2016 at about 1.45pm, a collision occurred at a cross junction (the “Junction”) on level 2 of the multi-storey carpark at Block 264 Serangoon Central (the “Carpark”), between the plaintiff’s car SKB 5808M and the lorry YL 1230L driven by the defendant (the “defendant’s lorry”).

2       As a result of the collision, the plaintiff was injured. The plaintiff brought this action for losses arising from his injuries.

3       The trial before me was solely to determine liability. After considering the evidence and the parties’ submissions, I apportion liability between the parties at 65% on the part of the plaintiff and 35% on the part of the defendant. I set out my reasons below.

## Undisputed facts

4       The Carpark is located near NEX shopping mall (“Nex”).

5       On the day of the accident, the plaintiff and his family were heading to Swensen’s at Nex to celebrate his daughter’s birthday. The plaintiff entered the Carpark to find a parking lot to park his car.[^1] The defendant was also heading to Nex to make some purchases, and had entered the Carpark to find a parking lot to park his lorry.[^2]

6       When the plaintiff was on level 2 of the Carpark, he made a right turn onto a driveway (“Driveway A”) and travelled straight for a short distance of about two car lengths before reaching the Junction.[^3]

7       A single broken white line on Driveway A (the “Broken White Line”) marked the beginning of the Junction for vehicles on Driveway A.[^4] On the opposite side of the Junction was a driveway of about two car lengths long (“Driveway C”), at the end of which vehicles would have to make a sharp right turn onto the adjacent driveway (“Driveway D”).[^5] Vehicles could go up to level 3 of the Carpark from Driveway D.

8       The plaintiff entered the Junction without stopping at the Broken White Line. He was travelling straight across the Junction onto Driveway C at the time of the collision.

9       The defendant’s lorry was on the driveway perpendicular and to the left of Driveway A (“Driveway B”). The defendant had already circled level 2 once but there were no empty parking lots. He therefore intended to turn left at the Junction onto Driveway C and then turn right onto Driveway D, so that he could go up to level 3 to find a parking lot.[^6]

10     There was no stop line or sign at the intersection of Driveway B and the Junction. There was only a left turning arrow on Driveway B, requiring vehicles to turn left onto Driveway C.[^7]

11     While the plaintiff’s car was crossing the Junction, the front right of the defendant’s lorry, which was in the process of turning left onto Driveway C, collided into the rear left passenger door of the plaintiff’s car. Due to the impact of the collision, the rear of the plaintiff’s car was shifted to the right and the plaintiff was injured.

12     For the purposes of illustration, I have labelled the relevant driveways and the Junction in the following two photographs of the accident scene which were taken by the plaintiff.[^8] The photographs depict: (a) the resting position of the plaintiff’s car post-collision, and (b) the position of the defendant’s lorry post-collision after he had reversed it a short distance so that he could open the driver’s door to alight from it [^9].

![]([2022] SGDC 0013_Image/[2022] SGDC 0013_image1.png)

13     On 14 March 2017, the Traffic Police issued the plaintiff a stern warning for inconsiderate driving in relation to the collision (the “Stern Warning”).[^10] The plaintiff was unsuccessful in his two appeals to the Traffic Police against the Stern Warning.[^11]

## Summary of the parties’ cases

14     The plaintiff pleaded that he was travelling straight across the Junction when the defendant’s lorry came from his left, failed to give way to his car, made a sudden sharp left turn and collided into the rear left of his car. The collision was therefore caused by the defendant’s negligence in (a) failing to keep a proper lookout, (b) travelling at an excessive speed, (c) failing to give way to the plaintiff’s car which had the right of way, (d) making the left turn without giving any warning or signal of his intention to do so, (e) failing to stop before the intersection of Driveway B and the Junction to look out for oncoming vehicles from Driveway A, and (f) failing to take evasive action to avoid the collision.[^12]

15     The plaintiff submitted that in the circumstances, the defendant should be wholly liable for the collision. Alternatively, even if the defendant’s case is taken at its highest, Diagram 1.33 of the _Motor Accident Guide: A Guide on the Assessment of Liability in Motor Accident Cases_ (Mighty Minds Publishing Pte Ltd, 2nd Ed, 2016) (“MAG”) states that where the driver having the right of way (_ie_, the plaintiff) had substantially passed the junction and the other vehicle (_ie_, the defendant) collided into the rear of his vehicle, the former’s liability, if any, should be decreased by 5% – 10%.[^13]

16     The defendant pleaded that he was making a left turn at the Junction when the plaintiff failed to comply with the stop line in the plaintiff’s direction and entered the Junction from the defendant’s right, driving across his path from his right to left. As a result, the defendant could not bring his lorry to a stop in time to avoid a collision with the plaintiff’s car. The collision was therefore caused or contributed to by the plaintiff’s negligence in (a) failing to keep a proper lookout, (b) failing to stop at the stop line in his direction to ensure that his path was clear before entering the Junction, (c) travelling at an excessive speed, (d) entering the Junction when it was unsafe to do so, and (e) giving the defendant no reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision.[^14] The defendant relied on the plaintiff’s alleged failure to address the Stern Warning in his pleadings and his AEIC as evidence of his negligence in causing the collision.[^15]

17     The defendant submitted that in the circumstances, the plaintiff should be wholly liable, or should bear substantial liability at no less than 90%, for the collision.[^16]

## Issues to be determined

18     Based on the parties’ pleaded cases, the following issues fall to be determined:

> (a)      **Issue 1:** which party had the right of way at the Junction, and whether the other party had failed to give way and had entered the Junction when it was unsafe to do so. In determining this issue, I will consider, among other things, whether both parties were required to stop on their respective driveways prior to entering the Junction;

> (b)      **Issue 2:** whether the parties had driven at an excessive speed;

> (c)      **Issue 3:** whether the parties had failed to keep a proper lookout;

> (d)      **Issue 4:** whether the defendant had failed to signal his intention to make a left turn at the Junction;

> (e)      **Issue 5:** whether the defendant had failed to take evasive action to avoid the collision;

> (f)      **Issue 6:** whether the plaintiff had failed to address the Stern Warning in his pleadings and his AEIC, and such failure constitutes evidence of his negligence in causing the collision;

> (g)      **Issue 7:** in light of my findings on Issues 1 to 6, the extent of each party’s liability for the collision.

## Issue 1: Who had the right of way and whether the other party had failed to give way

### The plaintiff’s case

19     The plaintiff submitted that pursuant to Rule 69A(c) of the Highway Code (1990, Rev Ed) (“Highway Code”) and paragraph 81(c) of the _Basic Theory of Driving_ 11th ed. (Singapore Traffic Police, 2019) (“Basic Theory of Driving”), at a cross junction, the driver who intends to turn left must give way to traffic going straight from the right. Thus, the plaintiff had the right of way. The defendant should have given way to the plaintiff by stopping on Driveway B, instead of attempting a left turn at the Junction when the plaintiff had not completely crossed the Junction.[^17]

20     To reinforce his case, the plaintiff highlighted in his AEIC and at trial that:[^18]

> (a)     when he returned to the accident site in January and February 2018, he discovered that the Broken White Line had been removed from Driveway A, and a solid white line with the word “STOP” had been painted directly in front of the left turning arrow on Driveway B;

> (b)     on the opposite side of level 2 of the Carpark, there was a similar cross junction. However, there was no broken white line for vehicles going straight across that junction. Instead, there was a single white line for vehicles turning left at that junction.

### The defendant’s case

21     The defendant submitted that he had the right of way as there was a Broken White Line across the plaintiff’s path into the Junction but no corresponding white line in the defendant’s direction of travel. The defendant contended that the photographs of the accident scene show that he had substantially entered the Junction and was completing the left turn, when the plaintiff failed to give way and sped through the Junction, thereby causing the collision.[^19]

### My findings

22     In my judgment, the defendant had the right of way at the Junction. The plaintiff had failed to give way to the defendant, and had entered the Junction when it was unsafe for him to do so.

23     At the time of the collision, there was a Broken White Line on Driveway A, but no stop line or sign at the intersection of Driveway B and the Junction: see \[7\] and \[10\] above. According to pages 34, 53 and 58 of MAG, if there is only a broken white line (as opposed to a stop line or sign) where the minor road joins the major road, the vehicle approaching the major road from the minor road must give way to oncoming traffic on the major road, but need not stop at the junction if it may safely enter the major road. Applying this principle, I find that the plaintiff was obliged to give way to oncoming traffic on Driveway B, but did not have to stop before the Broken White Line if he could safely enter the Junction.

24     Rule 69A(c) of the Highway Code and paragraph 81(c) of the Basic Theory of Driving do not support the plaintiff’s argument that he had the right of way at the Junction. They concern different factual scenarios as compared to the present case.

> (a)     Based on the diagrammatic illustration of Rule 69A(c) of the Highway Code (reproduced below), that rule concerns a situation where there are stop lines in front of _both_ the vehicle going straight as well as the vehicle turning left. In that situation, the vehicle turning left must give way to the vehicle going straight.

![]([2022] SGDC 0013_Image/[2022] SGDC 0013_image2.png)

> (b)     The beginning of paragraph 81(c) of the Basic Theory of Driving is prefaced with the statement “_At an uncontrolled junction where there are_ **_no_** _traffic lights_, **_“GIVE WAY” sign_** _or “STOP” sign_” (my emphasis). Paragraph 81(c) is therefore not applicable to the present case where there is a Broken White Line requiring vehicles on Driveway A to give way to oncoming vehicles on Driveway B.

25     The road markings on Driveways A and B _after_ the accident, and the road markings on a different cross junction on level 2 of the Carpark, also do not assist the plaintiff. They are irrelevant to the issue of who had the right of way, which is to be determined based on the road markings on Driveways A and B at the time of the accident.

26     Since the plaintiff did not have to stop before the Broken White Line if he could safely enter the Junction, the key issue is whether the plaintiff could have safely entered the Junction at the material time. I find that he could not. It was unsafe for him to enter the Junction as he was unable to finish crossing the Junction before the defendant’s lorry attempted to turn left at the Junction, in circumstances where neither party was travelling at an excessive speed at that time (see my findings at \[33\] – \[45\] below). Hence, the plaintiff should have stopped before the Broken White Line to allow the defendant’s lorry to complete its left turn into Driveway C, before he entered the Junction.

## Issues 2 and 3: Whether the parties had driven at an excessive speed and had failed to keep a proper lookout

27     I address Issues 2 and 3 together as there is significant overlap between my findings on each issue.

### The plaintiff’s case

28     The plaintiff submitted that the defendant had failed to check for vehicles going across the Junction in front of him before he turned left at the Junction. Instead, he executed the left turn while looking at his right rear mirror, and therefore failed to notice the plaintiff’s car which had already passed and was on his left, thus colliding into it. The defendant had also driven at an excessive speed. By contrast, the plaintiff had kept a proper lookout for vehicles on Driveway B and had driven slowly across the Junction.[^20]

29     In this regard, the plaintiff testified at trial that:

> (a)     He was driving slowly through the Carpark (as stated in his accident statement and his police report[^21]), as he was searching for an empty parking lot to park his car and was looking out for the presence of drivers or passengers in parked cars which may be exiting their parking lots.[^22]

> (b)     He had slowed down as he approached the Broken White Line to check for traffic.[^23]

> (c)     The moment he turned right onto Driveway A and straightened his car, he had a conical 45 degrees view of any vehicles and pedestrians, _ie_, there was a pillar to the left of the Broken White Line (the “Pillar”) and he could see any vehicles and pedestrians that were within the distance of two parked cars to the left of the Pillar. However, he did not see the defendant’s lorry. When his car was on the Broken White Line, he still could not see the defendant’s lorry.[^24]

> (d)     Thus, he crossed the Broken White Line into the Junction and was about to complete his crossing of the Junction when the collision occurred. The first time he saw the defendant’s lorry was shortly after the collision, when he turned his head to look behind him.[^25]

> (e)     While he did not see the defendant’s lorry prior to the collision, he could tell that the lorry was going at speed. The lorry was not in his line of sight when he was travelling on Driveway A or when his car was on the Broken White Line. Yet shortly thereafter, the lorry had entered the Junction and collided into his car.[^26] Furthermore, the impact of the collision was so great that it caused the rear of the plaintiff’s car to shift to the right at a 45 degrees angle.[^27]

> (f)     He did not attempt to overtake the defendant’s lorry from the right as he drove his car across the Junction. The accident site was a single lane carriageway and it was impossible for his car and the defendant’s lorry to be simultaneously in that lane.[^28]

> (g)     The defendant did not check in front of him when he was executing his left turn. The plaintiff’s car was in front of the defendant’s lorry.[^29]

### The defendant’s case

30     The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had failed to check whether there were oncoming vehicles on Driveway B, or slow down, before entering the Junction. Furthermore, instead of giving way to the defendant’s lorry which was already partially in the Junction, the plaintiff had attempted to squeeze past the lorry at a high speed, thereby causing the collision between the parties. By contrast, the defendant had kept a proper lookout before making the left turn at the Junction, and was not driving at an excessive speed.[^30]

31     In support of his submission, the defendant highlighted that there was no mention in the plaintiff’s accident statement and police report filed the day after the accident, his Statement of Claim and his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), that he had slowed down when approaching the Broken White Line and had checked that it was safe to enter the Junction before driving into the Junction. If the plaintiff had slowed down and checked for oncoming vehicles on Driveway B, the defendant’s lorry would have been clearly visible to him.[^31]

32     The defendant also relied on the following evidence he gave in his AEIC and/or at trial:

> (a)     Before making the left turn at the Junction, the defendant had checked his right mirror and right blind spot, checked in front of him and to his right for oncoming vehicles on Driveway A, and checked that he had sufficient space on his left to execute the turn. As his path was clear and there were no oncoming vehicles on Driveway A, he made the left turn. Thus, he had done the necessary checks before turning left. That was what he meant when he indicated that “_I checked for clearance_” in his accident statement.[^32]

> (b)     Despite having conducted these checks, he did not see the plaintiff’s car until after the collision had occurred.[^33]

> (c)     In his sketch plan in his accident statement, he had drawn a curved arrow to indicate the plaintiff’s path of travel across the Junction.[^34] In his view, the plaintiff could not have travelled in a straight line across the Junction. If the plaintiff had done so, his car would have crashed directly onto the right door of the defendant’s lorry. From the photographs of the accident scene, one can see that there was ample space for a car to squeeze in.[^35]

> (d)     The defendant slowed down as he was approaching the Junction. He was driving at a slow speed when he made the left turn because it was a sharp left turn and a short distance later, he had to make a sharp right turn from Driveway C onto Driveway D so as to go up to level 3 of the Carpark.[^36]

### My findings

33     In my judgment, neither party was driving at an excessive speed at the time of the collision. However, both parties had failed to keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles on each other’s driveways.

#### Neither party was driving at an excessive speed

34     I accept the defendant’s evidence that he was not driving at an excessive speed at the time of the collision. The defendant had to negotiate a sharp left turn at the Junction from Driveway B onto Driveway C. As Driveway C was only two car lengths long, very shortly after the defendant had completed the left turn, he would have to negotiate a sharp right turn from Driveway C onto Driveway D. There were parked vehicles on both sides of Driveway C: motorcycles parked illegally on the left, and cars parked legally on the right.[^37] There were also parked vehicles on both sides of Driveway D.[^38] Under these conditions, and given the size of the defendant’s lorry, the defendant would likely have been driving slowly in order to negotiate the sharp left turn, followed by the sharp right turn, without colliding into any of the parked vehicles.

35     Moreover, the damage caused to the parties’ vehicles by the collision was not severe. While the left rear passenger door of the plaintiff’s car was dented and scratched, the dents and scratches were not that deep or extensive.[^39] The defendant’s lorry was only slightly damaged: there were some cracks to the front right headlight, a dent just above the front right indicator light, and a few patches of paint around the dented area and the front right bumper had come off.[^40] This reinforces my view that the defendant was not speeding when he collided into the plaintiff’s car.

36     In my view, the fact that the rear of the plaintiff’s car had shifted to the right upon impact does not show that the defendant was driving at an excessive speed. Based on the photographs of the accident scene, the extent to which the rear of the car was slanted to the right was not so significant. I gauge it to be 30 degrees at most.[^41] Moreover, since the lorry was a bigger vehicle than the plaintiff’s car and was moving forward into the Junction at the time of the collision, it is only natural that the rear of the car would be shifted to the right when the front right of the lorry hit the rear left of the car.

37     To support his case that the defendant was driving at an excessive speed the plaintiff also relied on his evidence that the lorry was not in his line of sight when his car was on Driveway A or when his car was on the Broken White Line: see \[29(e)\] above. I am unable to accept his evidence for two reasons.

38     First, considering the position of the defendant’s lorry in Figure 1 (which was taken _after_ the lorry had been reversed), it is likely that about half of the lorry was already in the Junction at the point of collision. I have found earlier that the defendant had been driving slowly as he neared and then entered the Junction. Thus, I am of the view that at the time the plaintiff’s car was on the Broken White Line, the lorry would not have been more than the distance of two parked cars away from the Pillar.

39     On the plaintiff’s own case, while he was on Driveway A, he could see any vehicles or pedestrians on Driveway B up to the distance of two parked cars to the left of the Pillar: see \[29(c)\] above. In the premises, if the plaintiff had turned his head to the left to check for oncoming vehicles on Driveway B when his car was on the Broken White Line, he would have seen the lorry approaching the Junction to make a left turn. That he did not see the lorry until after the collision occurred indicated to me that he had not conducted such checks.

40     Second, the plaintiff’s assertion that he had checked for oncoming vehicles on Driveway B when his car was onto Driveway A, and again when his car was on the Broken White Line, was only raised for the first time at the trial. It was not mentioned in his police report[^42] and his accident statement filed a day after the accident,[^43] the two addendums to his accident statement,[^44] his letter dated 4 June 2017 to the traffic police to appeal against the Stern Warning,[^45] his solicitors’ letter dated 22 September 2017 to the traffic police to appeal against the Stern Warning,[^46] his Statement of Claim filed on 11 June 2019 or his AEIC affirmed on 2 July 2020. If the plaintiff had indeed conducted such checks, I am of the view that he would have mentioned this crucial matter in the said documents. My view is fortified by the fact that the plaintiff was able to provide details in his police report and his accident statement such as the fact that he was driving slowly, that he was wearing his seatbelt, that the impact of the collision was so great that the rear of his vehicle shifted towards the right, and a description of the damage to his car and the injuries he suffered as a result of the collision.[^47] However, his police report and his accident statement were silent on whether he had checked for oncoming vehicles on Driveway B before he entered the Junction.

41     Even if the plaintiff had inadvertently omitted to mention in his police report and his accident statement that he had conducted such checks, he had ample opportunity to correct that mistake by mentioning such checks in the addendums he filed to his accident statement, in the two written appeals he made to the Traffic Police, and in his Statement of Claim and his AEIC. Yet he did not do so. In the premises, I am unable to accept his assertion that he had checked for oncoming vehicles on Driveway B before he entered the Junction.

42     I now turn to the speed of the plaintiff’s car.

43     I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that he was driving slowly at the time of the collision. The plaintiff was searching for an empty parking lot in the Carpark: see \[29(a)\] above. Moreover, just two car lengths after he had crossed the Junction, he would have to make a sharp right turn from Driveway C onto Driveway D, in the process of which he had to ensure that he would not collide into the vehicles parked on both sides of Driveway C and Driveway D: see \[34\] above. Under these circumstances, I find that he would have been driving slowly as he entered the Junction.

44     I do not agree with the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff had sped up as he approached the Junction and had attempted to squeeze past the defendant’s lorry at a high speed. In my view, it is inconceivable that the plaintiff would have embarked on such a course of action as Driveway C was not wide enough to safely accommodate both his car and the defendant’s lorry side by side.[^48] In particular, if any part of the lorry was next to the plaintiff’s car while the plaintiff attempted to make the sharp right turn from Driveway C onto Driveway D, there would not have been sufficient space for the plaintiff to make that turn without colliding into the lorry and/or the parked vehicles in his immediate vicinity.

45     In any event, the defendant admitted at trial that he did not see the plaintiff’s car until the collision occurred and therefore did not know what speed the plaintiff was travelling at.[^49] In the premises, there is no basis for his argument that the plaintiff was travelling at an excessive speed.

#### The parties had failed to keep a proper lookout

46     I have found earlier that the plaintiff did not check for oncoming vehicles on Driveway B before he entered the Junction: see \[38\] – \[41\] above. This necessarily meant that the plaintiff did not keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles on Driveway B.

47     Turning to the defendant, I am of the view that he similarly did not keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles on Driveway A. Given that the parties were travelling slowly at the material time, I find that the plaintiff’s car would likely have been on Driveway A and about to enter the Junction, at the time the defendant started to execute the left turn. Thus, if the defendant had checked for oncoming vehicles on Driveway A just before he entered the Junction, he would have seen the plaintiff’s car. The only reason the defendant did not see the plaintiff’s car before the collision was that he did not conduct such checks. In my view, this was likely because his attention was on his front left, as his concern was to be able to turn left onto Driveway C and then within a short distance later, to execute the sharp right turn onto Driveway D.

## Issue 4: Whether the defendant had failed to signal his intention to make a left turn

48     Neither party pursued this issue at trial or in their closing submissions.

49     In my judgment, the plaintiff has not discharged his burden of proving that the defendant had failed to switch on his left signal before turning left at the Junction. The plaintiff did not allege such failure in his police report, his accident statement, the two addendums to his accident statement, the two written appeals he made to the Traffic Police, his Statement of Claim, his AEIC or at trial. Furthermore, the plaintiff’s evidence at trial was that he did not see the defendant’s lorry until after the collision had occurred: see \[29(e)\] above. That being the case, he would not know whether or not the defendant had switched on his left signal before turning left at the Junction.

## Issue 5: Whether the defendant had failed to take evasive action to avoid the collision

### The plaintiff’s case

50     The plaintiff submitted that the collision took place because the defendant had made a left turn without keeping a proper lookout. Put differently, the defendant did not take any evasive action to avoid the collision because he did not notice the existence of the plaintiff’s car at all until the collision occurred.[^50]

### The defendant’s case

51     The defendant submitted that there was nothing he could have done to prevent the collision, given that he was already substantially within the Junction and was completing his left turn when the plaintiff attempted to squeeze past the defendant’s lorry at high speed.[^51]

### My findings

52     I have found earlier that the defendant did not keep a proper lookout for oncoming vehicles on Driveway A, and that if he had done so, he would have seen the plaintiff’s car about to enter the Junction at the time he started to execute his left turn: see \[47\] above. It follows from this finding that the defendant had reasonable opportunity to avoid the collision: if he had kept a proper lookout, he could have chosen not to enter the Junction until the plaintiff’s car had completely crossed the Junction onto Driveway C. In the premises, I find that the defendant had failed to take evasive action to avoid the collision.

## Issue 6: Whether the plaintiff had failed to address the Stern Warning and such failure constitutes evidence of his negligence

53     The defendant submitted that the plaintiff had failed to address the Stern Warning in his pleadings and his AEIC, and that such failure is incontrovertible evidence of negligence on his part. In support of this submission, the defendant relied on _Cai Xiao Wing v Leow Fa Dong (by his next friend Leow Chye Huat)_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 67</span> (“_Cai Xiao Wing_”) at \[25\],[^52] where the High Court had held that:

> Even taking the respondent’s position at its highest, i.e. that the policeman had recorded his statement wrongly, by the time the stern warning was issued by the traffic police stating that the respondent was cycling at the material time, he should have written to the traffic police to clarify his position. The fact that he did not constitutes, in a way, an admission to liability.

54     I am unable to accept the defendant’s submission. In _Cai Xiao Wing_, the respondent’s case before the Court was that at the time of the collision, he was not cycling, but was walking next to his bicycle. However, in the parties’ respective police reports, the respondent had been classified as a cyclist. The respondent had also been issued a stern warning for “_riding_ other than in an orderly manner and without due regard to the safety of others” (my emphasis). Despite the allegedly incorrect description of himself as a cyclist in the police reports and in the stern warning, the respondent did not write to the police to clarify that he had not been cycling at the time of the collision. The High Court thus regarded the respondent’s failure to write to the police to clarify his position, as an admission of liability for the collision: see _Cai Xiao Wing_ at \[23\] – \[25\].

55     The facts of the present case are vastly different. Unlike the respondent in _Cai Xiao Wing_, the plaintiff had made two written appeals to the Traffic Police to withdraw the Stern Warning. The first appeal was made on or about 4 June 2017, slightly less than three months after the issuance of the Stern Warning.[^53] The second appeal was made on or about 22 September 2017, and in their appeal letter, the plaintiff’s solicitors had set out the plaintiff’s account of the accident and enclosed numerous supporting documents.[^54] Given that the plaintiff had challenged the Stern Warning within a few months of its issuance, I do not think that the fact that he did not address the Stern Warning in his pleadings and his AEIC can, in itself, amount to incontrovertible evidence of his negligence in causing the collision.

## Issue 7: The extent of each party’s liability for the collision

56     To summarise my findings above, the defendant was negligent in failing to keep a proper lookout and to take evasive action to avoid the collision. However, the plaintiff was contributorily negligent as he had failed to keep a proper lookout and more crucially, had failed to stop before the Broken White Line to allow the defendant’s lorry to complete its left turn onto Driveway C before he entered the Junction. This brings me to the issue of the extent of each party’s liability for the collision.

57     In scenario 12(a) of MAG (as depicted in the diagram on the next page), driver X is turning left from the minor road into the major road with a stop line at the junction adjoining the major road, while driver Y is moving straight ahead on the major road. The suggested apportionment of liability for a collision in this scenario is 80% on driver X and 20% on driver Y. This is on the basis that: (a) driver X should have stopped at the stop line to give way to oncoming traffic on the major road; and (b) while driver Y had the right of way, he should have kept a lookout for vehicles turning from the minor road onto the major road and taken evasive action to avoid a collision: see MAG at p. 51.

58     In my view, the plaintiff’s position is analogous to driver X, as he had entered the Junction from Driveway A where there was a Broken White Line requiring him to give way to oncoming vehicles on Driveway B. The defendant’s position is analogous to that of driver Y, who had the right of way at the Junction but had failed to keep a proper lookout and to take evasive action to avoid a collision with the plaintiff.

59     However, the 80:20 apportionment for scenario 12(a) of MAG is simply a guideline, and the Court may depart from it where the circumstances of the case so warrant. In the present case, I find that the defendant’s liability should be increased by 15% for two reasons.

> (a)     First, the plaintiff’s car had substantially crossed the Junction at the time the collision occurred, such that the lorry had collided into the rear left passenger door of the car. Page 53 of MAG suggests that in such a scenario, the liability of driver Y may be increased by 5% to 10% as he would have greater opportunity to avoid the collision than if driver X had only just entered the junction. I therefore increase the defendant’s liability by 10% on account of this factor.

> (b)     Second, there was no stop line on Driveway A, but simply a Broken White Line. Pages 53 to 54 of MAG suggest that in such a scenario, the liability of driver Y may be increased by 5% as he should have exercised more caution, given that the vehicle on the minor road must give way to oncoming traffic on the major road but need not stop at the junction if it may safely enter the major road. I therefore increase the defendant’s liability by 5% on account of this fact.

60     In the premises, I apportion liability for the collision at 65% on the part of the plaintiff and 35% on the part of the defendant. There shall be interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff to the extent of 35% of the damages to be assessed. Costs and interest are reserved to the trial judge assessing the damages.
