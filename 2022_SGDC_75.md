### District Judge Shawn Ho:

## Introduction

1       The Accused Persons, Mr Karthigan s/o Kalingan (“B1”) and Mr Karthigan s/o Ganesan (“B2”) claimed trial to three charges under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act and s 182 of the Penal Code (“the three charges”). Coincidentally, both Accused Persons have the same name — ‘Karthigan’ — which assumed a certain salience for the impeachment proceedings.

2       A reasonable doubt is a reasoned doubt, and is a necessary condition for an acquittal: _Public Prosecutor v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> at \[127\]-\[128\] & \[149(b)-(h)\], and reaffirmed in _Han Fang Guan v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 649</span> at \[36\]. Reasonable doubt may arise either from a weakness within the Prosecution’s case, or from doubt informed by a holistic assessment of the totality of the evidence: _GCK_ at \[134\]-\[135\].

3       In the present case, nobody (including the eye-witness[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) who lodged the First Information Report,[^2] the SCDF officer[^3] and the police officers) saw B1 inside, driving or exiting the motor lorry (“vehicle”).

4       B2 testified that he had driven the vehicle and collided into a railing, which was witnessed by Mr C Thineshwaran (“Mr Thinesh”). B2 asked Mr Sathish s/o Veeranan (“Mr Sathish”) to come down together with B1, thus, there was a small group of them at the scene. B2’s testimony largely cohered with that of B1 and the two defence witnesses. The first officer to arrive at the scene[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) saw a group of 3 or 4 people.[^5]

5       To be sure, the Accused Persons had informed the police at the scene that B1 was the driver and B2 was the passenger, as seen from the body worn camera footage (see, generally, _Public Prosecutor v Chong Chee Boon Kenneth and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 1434</span> at \[32\] & \[93\]). However, B2’s reasons for not informing the police that he had driven the vehicle — _ie._ B2 did not possess any driving licence, he had been involved in an accident, and he was scared at the material time — were not implausible. These reasons are found in B2’s police statement.[^6]

6       Almost immediately after the incident, at about 4a.m.,[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7) B2 had telephoned B1’s superior, Mr Mohammad Siraaj Bin Abdul Khaliq, to inform that B2 was the actual driver during the material time.[^8] B1 was remanded by the police.

7       I did not consider Mr Mohammad Siraaj’s credit to have been impeached. I accepted his explanation that his police statement contained an innocent discrepancy. Given that the Accused Persons have the same name, and the relevant portion was wedged in the middle of a long paragraph containing two hundred and sixty one words punctuated by parentheses, it was plausible that Mr Mohammad Siraaj was confused. My finding was fortified by two other interlacing points set out at \[74\]-\[79\] of my judgment.

8       Taken as a whole, the Prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused Persons for the three charges. Accordingly, they were acquitted on the three charges.[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9)

9       Both Accused Persons pleaded guilty to two new charges under s 182 of the Penal Code (“the two charges”),[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10) which had been framed pursuant to s 128(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

10     I set out my reasons.

## Charges and legal context

11     Mr Karthigan s/o Kalingan (“B1”) faced two charges:

> You, Karthigan s/o Kalingan, are charged that you, on the 16 May 2020, at about 3.00 a.m., along Blk 138 Marsiling Road, Singapore, whilst driving motor lorry, GBG 4004 C, did have so much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your breath, to wit, not less than 93 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, exceeded the prescribed limit of 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 67(1)(b) and punishable under Section 67(1) read with Section 67(2)(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed).[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

> You, Karthigan s/o Kalingan, are charged that you on or about the 20 May 2020 at about 3.20 p.m. at No 10 Ubi Avenue 3, Traffic Police Headquarter, Singapore, did give a false information to a public servant, Senior Investigation Officer Nor Faizal Bin Yahya (“SIO Faizal”), of the Singapore Police Force, to wit, by informing SIO Faizal that you were not the driver who drove the motor lorry GBG 4004 C on 16th May 2020 at or about 3 a.m. along Block 138 Marsiling Road, Singapore, which information you knew to be false, knowing it to be likely to cause the said SIO Faizal to omit continuing investigations against you for an offence of drink driving whilst driving the said motor lorry, which the said SIO Faizal ought not to omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed).[^12]

12     Mr Karthigan s/o Ganesan (“B2”) faced the following charge:

> You, Karthigan s/o Ganesan, are charged that you on or about the 20 May 2020 at about 2.15 p.m. at No 10 Ubi Avenue 3, Traffic Police Headquarter, Singapore, did give a false information to a public servant, namely Senior Investigation Officer Nor Faizal Bin Yahya (“SIO Faizal”) of the Singapore Police Force, to wit, by providing information that you were the driver who drove the motor lorry GBG 4004 C on 16th May 2020 at or about 3 a.m. along Block 138 Marsiling Road, Singapore, which information you knew to be false, knowingly it to be likely to cause the said SIO Faizal to omit continuing investigations against one Karthigan S/O Kalingan for an offence of drink driving, which the said SIO Faizal ought not to omit if the true state of facts were known by him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed).[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

13     The Prosecution and B1 consented to a joinder of his charges.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) The Prosecution and the Accused Persons consented to a joint trial of the three charges.[^15]

14     Pursuant to s 128(1) of the CPC, B1 faced a new charge:

> You, Karthigan s/o Kalingan, are charged that you on 16 May 2020 at about 4.02am in the vicinity of Block 138 Marsiling Road, Singapore, did give false information to a public servant, Station Inspector Ramesh M Ramasamy (“SI Ramesh”) of the Singapore Police Force, _to wit_, by informing SI Ramesh that you were the driver who drove the motor lorry GBG 4004 C with Karthigan s/o Ganesan as a passenger in the said lorry on 16th May 2020 at or about 3 a.m. along Block 138 Marsiling Road, Singapore, which information you knew to be false, knowing it to be likely to cause the said SI Ramesh to omit investigating one Karthigan s/o Ganesan for the offence of driving without a valid driving licence under s 35(1) and punishable under s 35(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276, 2004 Rev Ed), which the said SI Ramesh ought not to omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed).[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)

15     Pursuant to s 128(1) of the CPC, B2 faced a new charge:

> You, Karthigan s/o Ganesan, are charged that you on 16 May 2020 at about 3.46am in the vicinity of Block 138 Marsiling Road, Singapore, did give a false information to a public servant, Station Inspector Ramesh M Ramasamy (“SI Ramesh”) of the Singapore Police Force, _to wit_, by informing SI Ramesh that one Karthigan s/o Kalingan drove the motor lorry GBG 4004 C with you as a passenger in the said lorry on 16th May 2020 at or about 3 a.m. along Block 138 Marsiling Road, Singapore, which information you knew to be false, knowing it to be likely to cause the said SI Ramesh to omit investigating you for the offence of driving without a valid driving licence under s 35(1) and punishable under s 35(3) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276, 2004 Rev Ed), which the said SI Ramesh ought not to omit if the true state of facts were known by him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 182 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224, 2008 Rev Ed).[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17)

## Prosecution’s case

16     During the incident, B1 had driven the vehicle and B2 was his passenger. The Accused Persons informed the police at the scene that B1 was the driver and B2 was his passenger, as seen from the body worn camera footage. The credit of B1’s supervisor, Mr Mohammad Siraaj, was impeached.

## Defence’s case

17     B2 had driven the vehicle and collided into a railing, which was witnessed by Mr Thinesh. B2 called his brother-in-law, Mr Sathish, to come down together with B1, thus, there was a small group of them at the scene.

18     Almost immediately after the incident, at about 4a.m.,[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) B2 had telephoned Mr Mohammad Siraaj to inform that B2 was the actual driver during the material time.[^19] B1 was remanded by the police.

19     B2’s reasons for not informing the police at the scene that he had driven the vehicle were as follows: B2 did not possess any driving licence, he had been involved in an accident, and he was scared at the material time. B2 informed the police of these reasons in his police statement.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20)

20     Both Accused Persons had informed the investigation officer, Staff Sergeant Nor Faizal Bin Yahya (“SSgt Nor Faizal”)[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21) about the CCTV cameras at the block and carpark. They also repeatedly told him to check the CCTV camera footage but SSgt Nor Faizal failed to do so.[^22]

## Issues to be determined

21     The issues to be determined were:

> (a)     What did the eyewitness see (‘Issue 1’);

> (b)     What did the SCDF and police officers see (‘Issue 2’);

> (c)     What did the body worn camera footage establish (‘Issue 3’); and

> (d)     What was the defence witnesses’ evidence (‘Issue 4’).

## Issue 1: What did the eye-witness see?

22     Mr Muhammad Syamil bin Masruhen[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) made the First Information Report (FIR).[^24] He testified that when he heard a noise, he did not immediately get up to look out of his window as he was sleepy and was about to go to sleep.[^25] He was sitting on his bed at home.[^26] It took him about 1 minute before he looked at the incident and another 1-2 minutes before he called the police.[^27]

23     Mr Muhammad Syamil saw two people at the scene.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) One of them was at the passenger’s side of the vehicle, and the other person was walking over from the driver’s side to the passenger’s side of the vehicle.[^29] Mr Muhammad Syamil was unable to identify both people.[^30]

24     As his English was poor, Mr Muhammad Syamil explained that the FIR (_ie._ “2 person inside”) did not mean that he saw two people inside the vehicle.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) Instead, Mr Muhammad Syamil meant that he saw two people at the scene.[^32] He also testified that he did not see anyone exit from the vehicle.[^33]

25     In other words, Mr Muhammad Syamil’s testimony was that

> (a)     He did not see anybody inside the vehicle,[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) and

> (b)     He did not see anybody exit the vehicle.[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)

26     As Mr Muhammad Syamil was an objective witness and did not know the Accused Persons, he had no reason to help them. For completeness, I noted that another phrase in the FIR (_i.e._ “Pick up vehicle went _into the void deck_”) was also erroneous as the vehicle did not enter the void deck.

## Issue 2: What did the SCDF and police officers see?

### SCDF Officer

27     The first officer to arrive at the scene was the SCDF officer, Sergeant Zaidil Fitrie Mohd Jamal.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) He arrived at the scene about 6-8 minutes after receiving the FIR.[^37] The police officers arrived at the scene probably about 3-5 minutes after Sgt Zaidil.[^38]

28     When Sgt Zaidil arrived, he saw a group of 3 or 4 people at the scene.[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) He saw 2 or 3 male Indians walk away from the scene.[^40]

29     Sgt Zaidil saw the Accused Persons standing outside the vehicle.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) B2 was standing outside the passenger area of the vehicle.[^42] B1 was standing outside the driver’s side of the vehicle.[^43] Sgt Zaidil only spoke to the Accused Persons because they were the ones who were nearest the vehicle.[^44]

30     Sgt Zaidil did not see anybody inside the vehicle or exiting the vehicle.

### Police Officers

31     None of the police officers at the scene saw anybody inside the vehicle or exiting the vehicle.

32      Staff Sergeant Muhammad Hidayat Bin Mohamed Fadiah.[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45) SSgt Muhammad Hidayat reached the scene quite quickly as he was nearby and the carpark was connected.[^46] SSgt Muhammad Hidayat reached the scene in about 2-3 minutes once he received the FIR.[^47] He saw B1 outside the driver’s seat of the vehicle and B2 said that he was a passenger in the vehicle;[^48] they said that they were heading to work.[^49]

33     En route to the police station, B1 said that he told SSgt Muhammad Hidayat in the police car that they should not arrest him as he was not the driver.[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) SSgt Muhammad Hidayat could not really recall what B1 had said at that point of time.[^51]

34     While B1 was slightly drunk,[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) SSgt Muhammad Hidayat said that B1 was not so drunk to the extent that he did not know what was going on; B1 was still able to answer some of the questions.[^53] B1 was also able to remember what the police officers had told him, for example, they had told him that he was arrested for resisting arrest and not cooperating.[^54]

35      Staff Sergeant Johnson Goh Zhong Sheng.[\[note: 55\]](#Ftn_55) SSgt Johnson saw that B1 was seated at a railing, on the right side of the vehicle where the driver’s seat was.[^56] SSgt Johnson did not recall B1 informing him that B1 was not the driver. B2 said that he was not the driver.[^57] SSgt Johnson saw the Accused Persons at the incident location and he did not notice the other male Indians.[^58]

36      Station Inspector Ramesh s/o Muthiah Ramasamy.[\[note: 59\]](#Ftn_59) SI Ramesh arrived at the incident location slightly later than the first resource[^60].[^61] SI Ramesh did not really notice the crowd save for the Accused Persons and Mr Thinesh.[^62]

37     SI Ramesh testified that B1 was not totally drunk as he was able to understand SI Ramesh and answered all his questions clearly.[\[note: 63\]](#Ftn_63) When SI Ramesh told B1 to put away his cigarette, B1 was able to question him.[^64] B1 claimed to be the driver[^65] while B2 claimed to be the passenger.[^66]

## Issue 3: What did the body worn camera footage establish?

38     The Accused Persons had informed the police at the scene that B1 was the driver, as seen from the body worn camera footage of SI Ramesh and SSgt Muhammad Hidayat.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67)

39     For B1, the transcript of this footage at pages 10-12 reads:

> 
| 

SI Ramesh:

 |

40     For B2, the transcript of this footage at pages 8 and 13 reads:

 |

 |
| 

SI Ramesh:

## Issue 4: What was the defence witnesses’ evidence?

41      B1. B1 had been working on 16 May 2020. He then had drinks with Mr Sathish and slept over at the unit. When B1 woke up, he went downstairs and saw that the vehicle had mounted a kerb. He asked B2 what had happened. An ambulance arrived followed by police officers. B1 told them that it was his vehicle. B2 called Mr Mohammad Siraaj to inform him about the incident; B1 was in the lock-up (this was consistent with Mr Mohammad Siraaj’s statement to the police)[\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73).

42     B1’s statement to the police stated that at Woodlands Police Division, he “told the officer that I am not the driver but the officer still conduct the breath test.”[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74) SI Mahmud Dahalan[^75] could not really recall this conversation with B1.[^76] B1 testified that SI Mahmud Dahalan had told him to tell the Investigation Officer if B1 had anything to say[^77] — B1 did so in his police statement[^78] recorded by Staff Sergeant Nor Faizal Bin Yahya (“SSgt Nor Faizal”).[^79]

43     During the recording of his statement,[\[note: 80\]](#Ftn_80) B1 told SSgt Nor Faizal[^81] many times that B2 had driven the vehicle. SSgt Nor Faizal banged the table, shouted at him[^82] and told him to tell the truth. B1 also informed SSgt Nor Faizal that there were several CCTV cameras at the block and carpark but SSgt Nor Faizal did not take this seriously and failed to check the CCTV footage.[^83]

44      B2. On 16 March 2020, B2 left his home after taking the key to B1’s vehicle. As B2 had been a driver in the army, he thought that he still had his driving skills.

45     B2 saw Mr Thinesh walk past his block area so they chatted for a while. B2 went to the vehicle and started the engine. When driving, B2 turned too early and the vehicle rammed into the railing. Mr Thinesh, who was waiting for a Grab car, saw the incident. He ran over to the vehicle and asked B2 whether he was all right. B2 asked Mr Thinesh to go upstairs to call his brother in law, Mr Sathish, and B1 to come down. B2 also called Mr Sathish on the telephone.[\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84) Before they came down, the paramedics and police arrived. The paramedic attended to B2 and Mr Thinesh, before B1 came down. At the incident scene, B2 had informed SI Ramesh that he had called B1 to come down.[^85]

46     After the incident, B2 exited the vehicle and walked over to the front passenger side without opening the door because he wanted to see the damage to the vehicle. He did so as due to the lighting conditions (as visible from the video), the driver’s side was too dark and only the front passenger side was brightly lit. B1 was at the driver’s side because he was trying to handle the ignition key which was stuck.

47     B2 contacted Mr Mohammad Siraaj and told him about the incident; this was corroborated by Mr Thinesh’s testimony. B2 admitted to him that he had driven the vehicle. At about 5am plus or 6am, B2 waited for and met Mr Mohammad Siraaj at the parking area. Mr Mohammad Siraaj scolded him for what he had done and asked B2 to bail out B1.

48     B2 kept contacting the Investigation Officer because B2 wanted to tell him the truth. Hence, B2 and B1 went to the Traffic Police five days later. SSgt Nor Faizal did not believe B2 and thought that B2 was covering up for B1. SSgt Nor Faizal kept banging the table,[\[note: 86\]](#Ftn_86) behaved aggressively,[^87] and threatened B2 that he was giving false evidence. Both Accused Persons repeatedly told SSgt Nor Faizal to check the CCTV camera footage but SSgt Nor Faizal did not do so.[^88]

49     At the incident scene, B2 was quite scared when the police questioned him about the driver’s identity. Since B1 has a licence and a vehicle, B2 told the police that B1 was the driver with B2 being the passenger. B2 testified that he was too afraid so he said that he had not driven the vehicle.

50     This was consistent with B2’s statement to the police:[\[note: 89\]](#Ftn_89)

> Q5)    Why did you tell the Police officer that ‘Karthigan’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Kalingan NRIC S----266H) was the one who drove his motor lorry GBG 4004C and sent you back home after work?

> A5)     **I did not possess any licence and was involved with accident. I was scared during that time** and I admitted did not inform the officer about it”.

> \[emphasis added\]

51     In my view, B2’s reasons for not informing the officer that he had driven the vehicle — _ie._ B2 did not possess any driving licence, he had been involved in an accident (_viz._ he caused the vehicle to collide into a railing), and he was scared and too afraid at the material time — were not implausible.

52     B2 also testified that he had:

> (a) compensated the Town Council for the damage to the railing[\[note: 90\]](#Ftn_90) and also

> (b) compensated Mr Mohammad Siraaj for the damage to the vehicle.

53      Mr Thinesh.[\[note: 91\]](#Ftn_91) On 16 March 2020, Mr Thinesh met B2 under the block and they chatted for a while.

54     Mr Thinesh saw B2 go to the vehicle and drive off. Mr Thinesh heard a loud sound and saw B2 crash the vehicle into a silver railing. Mr Thinesh went to the vehicle and opened the passenger’s door as it was nearest to Mr Thinesh. Mr Thinesh also opened the driver’s door, and saw that the vehicle’s ignition key was really bent. Mr Thinesh panicked as he had just witnessed an accident.

55     B2 asked Mr Thinesh to call B1. Mr Thinesh went upstairs and only saw Mr Sathish. Mr Thinesh informed him that B2 was involved in an accident. Mr Thinesh then went downstairs to wait with B2. Mr Sathish and B1 came down a few minutes later.

56     The paramedic asked B2 if he needed any help and if he was injured. As B2 informed that he did not need any medical assistance, the paramedics left the scene. There was one Police car that drove past but did not stop at the scene. Later, policemen arrived and asked about the owner of the vehicle – the policemen questioned B1.

57     B2 called Mr Mohammad Siraaj on the telephone. B2 also called for the tow truck.

58     While Mr Thinesh had known B1 and B2 for about 8 to 9 years in secondary school, they meet up very rarely.

59      Mr Sathish.[\[note: 92\]](#Ftn_92) On 16 March 2020, B1 came to Mr Sathish’s home in the evening. B2 and Mr Sathish’s wife were also at home. After drinking alcohol with Mr Sathish for several hours, B1 feel asleep in Mr Sathish’s home.

60     Mr Sathish was working in the living room and his night shift as an IT Engineer started at around 11.30p.m.. He saw B2 step out of the home. Mr Sathish received a telephone call from B2 about an accident. B2 asked Mr Sathish to wake B1 up. Mr Thinesh also came up to the home to inform that an accident had taken place; Mr Thinesh asked Mr Sathish to wake B1 up. Mr Thinesh then went downstairs.

61     Mr Sathish woke B1 up. They both went downstairs to see what had happened, with B1 rushing ahead of Mr Sathish. When Mr Sathish reached the scene, he saw B1 checking the vehicle. He saw B2 and Mr Thinesh standing around.

62     Mr Sathish’s wife was quite worried and kept calling him. She wanted Mr Sathish to return home so he went upstairs before returning with her to the scene.

63     There were policemen at the scene and they told Mr Sathish not to go close so he just stood at one corner. Mr Sathish thought that B1 had been arrested for arguing with the police. After B1’s arrest, they called for a tow truck.

64     Mr Sathish did speak once to the investigation officer, SSgt Nor Faizal. Mr Sathish did not have the habit of answering phone calls from unknown numbers. He did not receive the letter dated 4 March 2022[\[note: 93\]](#Ftn_93) asking him to attend at the Traffic Police as the address stated on the letter was incorrect.

65     Mr Sathish has known B1 for about 5 years. B1 is related to Mr Sathish’s wife’s sister’s ex-husband. Mr Sathish has known B2 for about 11 to 12 years. B2 is Mr Sathish’s wife’s brother.

66     Mr Sathish testified that he is telling the truth although he was aware that by doing so, he was getting his own brother-in-law (B2) into trouble with the law.

## Impeachment

### The Law on impeachment

67     Guidance on the scope and relevance of an impeachment exercise can be found in _Osman Bin Ramli v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 2 SLR(R) 959</span> at \[29\] to \[32\]:

> (a)     First, “innocent” discrepancies must be distinguished from deliberate lies.

> (b)     Second, the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions in her evidence. “Serious discrepancies” or “material contradictions” are those that go to the crux of the charge against the accused person.

> (c)     Third, even if a witness’s credit is impeached, it does not automatically lead to a total rejection of her evidence. The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which aspect should be disregarded.

68     The credit of the witness is impeached upon the inconsistent former statement being proved, _Kwang Boon Keong Peter v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1998\] 2 SLR(R) 211</span> at \[22\].

69     In the present case, the Prosecution sought to impeach the credit of a witness, Mr Mohammad Siraaj Bin Abdul Khaliq,[\[note: 94\]](#Ftn_94) on portions of his statement to the police and his testimony in court under s 157(c) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). The Prosecution did not succeed in doing so. I shall analyse portions of his statement which were highlighted by the Prosecution in court, against his testimony.

### Statement

70     Mr Mohammad Siraaj’s statement to the police reads as follows:[\[note: 95\]](#Ftn_95)

> Q8)    Can you tell me what happened on 16/05/2020 along Blk 138 Marsiling Road?

> A8)    During that time, the motor lorry GBG 4004C was assigned to ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Kalingan NRIC S----266H). From what I can recall, I did receive a call around 4am from my other friend known as ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Ganesan NRIC S----604H). ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Ganesan NRIC S----604H) told me that the motor lorry got into accident. I did ask him where the accident location and he told me the accident happen at Marsiling. I then asked him whether the vehicle condition is very bad, and he told me that the vehicle is unable to be driving. ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Ganesan NRIC S----604H) also told me that he will call the tow truck to tow the motor lorry GBG 4004C to a heavy carpark. I then asked ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Ganesan NRIC S----604H) where the actual driver ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Kalingan NRIC S----266H) and he told me he was arrested by Police for drink driving. ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Kalingan NRIC S----266H) also admitted to me that he is the actual driver during that time and **_did not inform the Police during that time_**. I **_then_** took my motorcycle from home and went to the heavy carpark. I did check the vehicle and call towing for the motor lorry GBG 4004C to be tow to the workshop. I did not meet up with ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Ganesan NRIC S----604H) after which.

> \[emphasis in underlined portions by the Prosecution; additional emphasis in bold italics\]

71     Mr Mohammad Siraaj’s statement mentioned that B1 said he was the actual driver during the material time.[\[note: 96\]](#Ftn_96) The Prosecution stated that the statement had been read back to Mr Mohammad Siraaj who had also read it, and he should have been more careful for a police statement.[^97] The full names of the Accused Persons had been listed in brackets.[^98]

72     As against this, Mr Mohammad Siraaj testified that it was B2 who had informed him that day that B2 was the actual driver during the material time.[\[note: 99\]](#Ftn_99) Mr Mohammad Siraaj explained that as the Accused Persons have the same name — ‘Karthik’— he had been confused.[^100]

73     I accepted Mr Mohammad Siraaj’s explanation that it was an innocent discrepancy. Given that the Accused Persons have the same name, and the relevant portion was wedged in the middle of a long paragraph containing two hundred and sixty one words punctuated by parentheses (see above at \[70\]), it was plausible that Mr Mohammad Siraaj was confused. My finding was fortified by two interlacing points.

74     First, the relevant sentence reads:

> ‘Karthik’ (Recorder’s note: Refer to Karthigan S/O Kalingan NRIC S----266H) also admitted to me that he is the actual driver during that time and **did** **_not_** **inform the Police during that time**.

> \[emphasis added\]

75     That gave me pause as B1 did inform the police officers at the scene that he had been the driver. And it was _B2_ who “did _not_ inform the Police during that time” that he was the actual driver. In other words, it was likely that Mr Mohammad Siraaj was referring to B2, not B1, as it was B2 who had not informed the police at the scene that he had been the driver.

76     Second, the next sentence reads:

> I **then** took my motorcycle from home and went to the heavy carpark.

> \[emphasis added\]

77     When Mr Mohammad Siraaj said that he spoke to someone and “**_then_** took (his) motorcycle from home and went to the heavy carpark”, any conversation that Mr Mohammad Siraaj had must have taken place _before_ he had “quickly rushed down” to the heavy carpark.[\[note: 101\]](#Ftn_101) As B1 was remanded by the police, Mr Mohammad Siraaj likely did not manage to talk to B1 that morning.[^102] B1 denied calling Mr Mohammad Siraaj before his remand. B1 also clarified that he did not state in his statement that he had called Mr Mohammad Siraaj and told him that the vehicle was involved in an accident;[^103] in support of this, B1’s evidence was that at the incident scene he had asked the police officers to tell B2 to call Mr Mohammad Siraaj to tell him what had happened:[^104]

> 
| 

Officer:

 | 

You want to talk which one, the black t-shirt ah

 |
| 

B1:

 | 

Ah ya

 |
| 

Another officer:

 | 

…tell him about the car is … the car condition to his supervisor

 |
| 

Officer:

 | 

Ok

 |
| 

B1:

 | 

No no no bro bro … bro bro … uh … because the fella … uh … young guy, he don’t know the … my supervisor’s … phone number

 |
| 

Officer:

 | 

Ok

 |
| 

B1:

 | 

I give him …

 |

  
  

78     No phone records were produced by the Prosecution to show that B1 had called Mr Mohammad Siraaj before being remanded. And it was undisputed that Mr Mohammad Siraaj had spoken to B2 early that morning.[\[note: 105\]](#Ftn_105)

79     In the circumstances, it stands to reason that the person who had informed Mr Mohammad Siraaj that he was the actual driver was likely B2 and not B1.

80     In my analysis of the impeachment application, I took into account the totality of the evidence tendered at trial: _Kwang Boon Keong Peter_ at \[21\]. I also had the opportunity to observe Mr Mohammad Siraaj’s demeanour when he testified in a matter-of-fact manner. All things considered, Mr Mohammad Siraaj Bin Abdul Khaliq’s credit was not impeached.

## Verdict

81     In the present case, nobody (including the eye-witness[\[note: 106\]](#Ftn_106) who lodged the First Information Report,[^107] the SCDF officer[^108] and the police officers) saw B1 inside, driving or exiting the vehicle.

82     B2 testified that he had driven the vehicle and collided into a railing, which was witnessed by Mr Thinesh. B2 asked Mr Sathish to come down together with B1, thus, there was a small group of them at the scene. B2’s testimony largely cohered with that of B1 and the two defence witnesses. The first officer to arrive at the scene[\[note: 109\]](#Ftn_109) saw a group of 3 or 4 people.[^110]

83     To be sure, the Accused Persons had informed the police at the scene that B1 was the driver and B2 was the passenger, as seen from the body worn camera footage. However, B2’s reasons for not informing the police that he had driven the vehicle — _ie._ B2 did not possess any driving licence, he had been involved in an accident, and he was scared at the material time — were not implausible. These reasons are found in B2’s police statement.[\[note: 111\]](#Ftn_111)

84     With respect, several of the Prosecution’s arguments needed to be placed in proper perspective. For example, the Prosecution’s argument that B1 “provided a detailed account of events to SI Ramesh, stating that he had … lost control of the lorry”[\[note: 112\]](#Ftn_112) must be placed in proper perspective. The phrases “maybe you lost control ah” and “then you go over hit” originated from SI Ramesh.[^113]

85     The Prosecution’s argument that “Thinesh has also changed his evidence where it suits his purposes … Thinesh claimed that he had not booked a Grab and intended to _flag one_” (emphasis added)[\[note: 114\]](#Ftn_114) must also be placed in proper perspective. This was because Mr Thinesh:

> (a)     Mentioned the flagging of a taxi as an analogy, and

> (b)     Mr Thinesh explained that when he said that he was waiting for Grab, he had not booked his Grab ride at that point of time as it was too expensive and he had opened his Grab application and was waiting for the Grab price to go down.

86     Almost immediately after the incident, at about 4a.m.,[\[note: 115\]](#Ftn_115) B2 had informed Mr Mohammad Siraaj, that B2 was the actual driver during the material time.[^116] B1 was remanded by the police.

87     I did not consider Mr Mohammad Siraaj’s credit to have been impeached. I accepted his explanation that his police statement contained an innocent discrepancy. Given that the Accused Persons have the same name, and the relevant portion was wedged in the middle of a long paragraph containing two hundred and sixty one words punctuated by parentheses, it was plausible that Mr Mohammad Siraaj was confused. My finding was fortified by two other interlacing points set out at \[74\]-\[79\] of my judgment.

88     Taken as a whole, the Prosecution had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the Accused Persons for the three charges. Accordingly, they were acquitted on the three charges.[\[note: 117\]](#Ftn_117)

89     Both Accused Persons pleaded guilty to two new charges under s 182 of the Penal Code (“the two charges”),[\[note: 118\]](#Ftn_118) which had been framed pursuant to s 128(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

## Conclusion

90     I am grateful for the hard work and submissions of both sides. I will proceed to hear submissions on sentence for the two charges.
