### District Judge Clement Seah Chi-Ling:

## Introduction

1       This is the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for an aggregate sum of S$150,035.40 representing amounts unpaid under two partially paid invoices. The invoices arose from the Plaintiff’s deployment, at the Defendant’s request, of product promoters for the Defendant’s products at various locations in Singapore under a contract dated 1 February 2019 (the “**Contract**”). The Defendant has, in turn, counterclaimed against the Plaintiff for, among other things, the sum of S$260,763.28, being amounts the Defendant alleged it had overpaid the Plaintiff as a result of the latter’s failure to furnish supporting documents for various specified deployments to the Defendant’s satisfaction.

## The parties

2       The Plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore, and is in the business of providing promoter deployment and outsourcing management services.

3       At all material times, one Ang Meng Hwee Alvin (“**Mr. Alvin Ang**”) was a director of the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff’s representative who entered into the Contract on the Plaintiff’s behalf.

4       The Defendant is a company incorporated in Singapore, and is in the business of, _inter alia_, the import/export and distribution of consumer products.

5       Mr. Lee Quan Feng, also known as Sean Lee (“**Mr. Sean Lee**”), was the former General Manager of the Defendant who entered into the Contract on behalf of the Defendant. It was not disputed that Mr. Sean Lee, as the then General Manager of the Defendant, had authority to enter into the Contract on the Defendant’s behalf.

## Procedural History

6       On 21 January 2020, the Plaintiff commenced HC/S 62/2020 in the High Court against the Defendant, claiming the sum of S$401,644.06. On 23 March 2020, the Plaintiff filed an application for summary judgment vide HC/SUM 1362/2020. On 17 June 2020, the Assistant Registrar who heard the application made, _inter alia_, the following orders:

> (a)     That the Defendant does pay the Plaintiff the sum of S$251,608.66; and

> (b)     That the Defendant be given unconditional leave to defend the balance of the Plaintiff’s claim in the sum of S$150,035.40.

7       The sum of S$150,035.40 represents the balance of amounts remaining unpaid in respect of Deployments under two invoices – Invoice No. 1402486 dated 1 October 2019 and Invoice No. 1402056 dated 9 November 2019 (the “**Unpaid Invoices**”). Apart these two Unpaid Invoices, a further eight invoices were issued by the Plaintiff in respect of Deployments under the Contract, all of which had been paid in full by the Defendant[^1].

8       The sum of S$251,608.66 ordered to be paid to the Plaintiff in the summary judgment proceedings was duly paid by the Defendant on or about 5 July 2020.

9       By an order of court dated 4 August 2020, HC/S 62/2020 was thereafter transferred to the State Courts in DC/DC 1927/2020, by consent. The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant in DC/DC 1927/2020 is for, _inter alia_, the sum of S$150,035.40. The Defendant’s Counterclaim in DC/DC 1927/2020 is, on the other hand, for the sum of $260,763.28, or alternatively, for the sum of $410,798.68 in the event this court allows the Plaintiff’s claim in full.

## Background Facts

### The Project

10     In or around late 2018, the Defendant, Tohtonku (S) Pte Ltd, was looking to outsource its brand ambassadors (“**BA**s”) – _i.e._, persons who were tasked with marketing the Plaintiff’s consumer products at designated retail outlets in Singapore - to third parties instead of employing these BAs under its own payroll (the “**Project**”).

11     Mr. Sean Lee, the Plaintiff’s then General Manager, was tasked with overseeing and implementing the Project. Mr. Sean Lee proceeded to invite quotes from interested bidders.

12     Mr. Alvin Ang is the Director of the Plaintiff. Mr. Sean Lee had prior experience working with the Plaintiff during his previous employment with another company. By an email dated 25 July 2018 from Mr. Sean Lee to Mr. Alvin Ang, Mr. Sean Lee invited the Plaintiff to submit a quotation for the deployment of product promoters (the “**Deployments**”) to market the Defendant’s consumer products at the Defendant’s designated retail outlets in Singapore[^2]. Mr. Alvin Ang informed Mr. Sean Lee in person that the Plaintiff was keen to provide the Deployments, and they started negotiating the terms of such an engagement, including the total number and the rate for the Deployments, and the commission and fee payable to the Plaintiff.

13     On or around 4 January 2019, Mr. Sean Lee informed the Mr. Alvin Ang via email that the Defendant had decided to engage the Plaintiff for the Deployments.

### The Contract

14     The terms of the engagement were contained in a contract dated 1 February 2019 (the “**Contract**”). The Plaintiff first provided the Defendant with a draft Contract by an email dated 13 February 2019.

15     By an email dated 4 March 2019 (the “**4 March Email**”) from Mr. Sean Lee to Mr. Alvin Ang, the Defendant accepted the terms of the Contract and provided the Plaintiff with a signed copy of the Contract. The Contract was executed by Mr. Sean Lee on behalf of the Defendant. The email enclosing the signed Contract was copied to:

> (a)     the Defendant’s director, Mr. Lim Chee Keong, also known as “Jasper Lim” (“**Mr. Lim**”);

> (b)     the Defendant’s Head of Marketing, Mr. Soon Eu Jin (“**Mr. Soon**”); and

> (c)     the Defendant’s Finance Manager, Ms. Elyn Low (“**Ms. Low**”).[^3]

16     Based on the Contract, the start-date of the Project was to be 1 May 2019.

17     The salient terms of the Contract[^4], so far as material for present purposes, were as follows:

> (a)     The commencement and end dates of the Services are 1 May 2019 and 30 April 2021, respectively (the “**Period**”);

> (b)     The Plaintiff would provide 5,440 “activation points island wide” in respect of the Services, _i.e._ the Plaintiff is obligated under the Contract to provide 5,440 Deployments within the Period, at the Defendant’s request; and

> (c)     The Activation Charges, provided that the Defendant utilises a minimum of 5,440 activation slots during the Period, would be $164.00 per slot.

18     Two other provisions in the Contract which are relevant for present purposes were:

> (a)     a “conclusive evidence clause” contained in Clause 2 (_Time Records & Invoicing_) of the Contract (the “**Conclusive Evidence Clause**”), as follows:

>> **“2**.     **Time Records & Invoicing**

>> Jump Solutions Pte Ltd will invoice Tohtonku (S) Pte Ltd on a project-ending basis for its project management services and the Tohtonku (S) Pte Ltd shall be conclusive and binding to the work performed by Jump Solutions Pte Ltd employees.”

> (b)     a payment clause in Clause 3(i) (_Client Warranties_) of the Contract (the “**Payment Clause**”), as follows:

>> **“3**.     **Client Warranties**

>> …

>> Tohtonku (S) Pte Ltd shall make prompt settlement of the undisputed amount, which are supported by Jump Solutions accurate invoices within payment terms, and when Tohtonku (S) is satisfied that the work has been performed in accordance with this agreement as invoices largely represents work performed and consumed.”

### The First Invoice

19     Pursuant to the Contract, the Plaintiff commenced providing the Deployments to the Defendant in the month of May 2019, and issued an invoice dated 4 June 2019 to the Defendant for the Deployments (the “**First Invoice**”). The First Invoice was in respect of Deployments for the month of May 2019 and the amount billed (inclusive of GST) was S$66,311.28[^5].

20     To support the Plaintiff’s claims for the Deployments under the First Invoice, the Plaintiff had attached a schedule (the “**Summary Schedule**”) which detailed the following:

> (a)     The number of Deployments for each day of the month; and

> (b)     The store outlets (the “**Outlets**”) specified by the Defendant that the Deployments were to be deployed at for each day of the month.

21     An example of a Summary Schedule can be found at Mr. Alvin Ang’s affidavit at page 38[^6]. It could be observed from the sample Summary Schedule that while it showed the number of Deployments on each day of the month at each named Outlet, it did not include the names of the BAs that were physically deployed, nor did it include any acknowledgement by the Outlet personnel that the Deployments did in fact take place. The Summary Schedule was therefore, in essence, a summary of the number of units of BAs deployed for a given month broken down by days and by Outlets.

22     On 9 June 2019, Mr. Sean Lee sent an email to Mr. Alvin Ang, copied to Ms. Low, Mr. Soon and Mr. Kelvin Cheong (the Defendant’s Head of Sales, hereinafter, “**Mr. Cheong**”), among other things, instructing Ms. Low to proceed with payment once Mr. Soon and Mr. Cheong have “confirmed on the slots and additional vouchers purchased”[^7].

### The Second, Third and Fourth Invoices

23     On or around 2 July 2019, a second invoice was issued by the Plaintiff for the sum of $79,510.18 (“the **2nd Invoice**”), together with the accompanying Summary Schedule in the same format.

24     Thereafter, on 5 August 2019 and 5 September 2019, the Plaintiff issued its third and fourth invoices for Deployments in the months of July 2019 and August 2019 in the sums of $88,946.96 and $100,791.86 respectively[^8].

25     In summary, by the beginning of October 2019, the Plaintiff had issued the following four invoices in respect of Deployments for the months of May 2019 through August 2019 in an aggregate sum of S$335,560.28[^9]. All four invoices were paid in full by the Defendant (the “**Paid Invoices**”). Copies of the Paid Invoices and the corresponding Summary Schedules are collectively annexed at PBA \[37-45\]:

26     For the first four invoices, at the point of submission, the invoices were only accompanied by the relevant month’s Summary Schedule as the only supporting document[^10]. The Defendant had made payment on these invoices without any _documented_ objection or reservation of rights at or prior to the time of payment.

### The Unpaid 5th and 6th Invoices

27     On or about 1 October 2019, the Plaintiff issued to the Defendant the 5th Invoice for the sum of S$111,271.44 (the “**5th Invoice**”). The 5th Invoice was in relation to the Deployments for the month of September 2019.

28     Based on the erstwhile practice of the parties, the 5th Invoice was initially only accompanied by the Summary Schedule as the only supporting document.

29     Pursuant to the terms of the 5th Invoice, the Defendant was required to make payment of the sum of S$111,271.44 by 31 October 2019 (_i.e._ within 30 days).

30     As of 31 October 2019, the Plaintiff had not received payment from the Defendant in relation to the 5th Invoice. When queried by the Plaintiff, the Defendant replied that it would not be making payment of the October Invoice due to “discrepancies” in the invoice.

31     On or about 9 November 2019, the Plaintiff issued to the Defendant the 6th Invoice for the sum of S$108,776.20 (the “**6th Invoice**”). The 6th Invoice was in relation to the Deployments for the month of October 2019. Likewise, the 6th Invoice was also not paid by the Defendant.

32     As noted in \[6\] above, the Defendant has since obtained summary judgement in respect of portions of the 5th and 6th Invoices. A summary of the remaining unpaid balances under the 5th and 6th Invoices is set out below, and form the subject matter of the Plaintiff’s claim in DC/DC 1927/2020.

### Timesheets/punch cards provided by Plaintiff

33     While the 1st to 6th Invoices were only accompanied by Summary Schedules, the evidence revealed that time sheets and/or punch cards collected back by the Plaintiff from the BAs were sent by the Plaintiff to the Defendant as and when they were compiled by the Plaintiff.

34     For instance, on 20 August 2019, Mr. Alvin Ang had sent an email to Ms. Low attaching the “scanned punched cards” and “timesheets” that the Plaintiff had “collected back” in respect of the Deployments in July 2019. In the same email, Mr. Alvin Ang also queried Ms. Low if payment for the 3rd Invoice would make it in time for the end of the month, _i.e._ end of August 2019[^11].

35     In a similar vein, in a series of WhatsApp exchanges between Mr. Alvin Ang and Mr. Cheong dated 8 October 2019, the latter noted:

> _“So far we’ve only received the deployment summary but not the timesheets. We need the actual timesheet/attendance endorsed by the individual outlets in order to verify the actualised deployment rather than just the summary_. Auditor will request for these timesheets to justify the payment.”[^12]_(emphasis added)_

36     Eventually, the timesheets for the Deployments for the May to September 2019 Deployments were sent by Mr. Alvin Ang as follows: -

### Events in October/November 2019

37     In or around October 2019, the Defendant’s Mr. Lim was informed by his sister, Ms. Jowey Lim, of the poor performance of the Deployments in certain outlets. Mr. Lim was also informed that the Defendant had discovered some discrepancies in the documents that the Plaintiff had sent over.

38     On or around 20 October 2019, Mr. Lim instructed Ms. Low not to make any further payments to the Plaintiff while internal investigations were being carried out.

39     On 5 November 2019, Mr. Alvin Ang sent an email to Ms. Low, attaching “some of the samples that \[the Plaintiff had\] collected back” and stated that the Plaintiff was “still facing some problems in getting the store to either get stamps or indicate their names…”[^15].

40     A meeting involving personnel from the Plaintiff, the Defendant and Tohtonku Sdn Bhd (the parent company of the Defendant, hereinafter, “**Tohtonku (Malaysia)**”) then took place on 12 November 2019 (the “**12 November Meeting**”) to sort out the issues between parties, including the issues of the unpaid invoices and timesheets.

41     Over the course of 13 to 15 November 2019, emails were exchanged between the attendees of the 12 November Meeting, regarding the minutes of the meeting and the matters discussed (the “**13-15 November Email Exchanges**”). Clarifications and responses were posed and/or provided by Ms. Rachel Chua (the Head of Finance of Tohtonku (Malaysia), hereinafter, “**Ms. Chua**”), Ms. Low and Mr. Alvin Ang on specific issues documented in the minutes[^16]. In particular, Tohtonku (Malaysia)’s Ms. Chua pointed out that the timesheets had to be rectified by the Plaintiff in that they had to be “chopped signed by outlet personnel” (_i.e._ stamped by the outlet in which the Deployment had been deployed at). This was rejected by Mr. Alvin Ang who pointed out that what was agreed was for the Plaintiff to procure either the stamp of the outlet or to procure “signature accompanied with name of store in charge” _viz_ the signature and name of the store supervisor. Ms. Chua response was that if the outlet chop could not be obtained, the Plaintiff should obtain the store personnel’s Identity Card (IC) number and full name. There was no express assent by Mr. Alvin Ang to this counter proposal. In particular, Mr. Alvin Ang expressed difficulties in obtaining personal information from outlet personnel as they were not under the Plaintiff’s control. Mr. Alvin Ang’s reply to chain of emails showed that while he was prepared to accede to certain requests, he did not agree to all of Ms. Chua’s demands.

42     Separately, in a series of emails exchanged between Mr. Alvin Ang and Ms. Low (copied to Mr. Sean Lee, Mr. Soon and Mr. Cheong) between 27 November 2019 and 4 December 2019[^17], Ms. Low informed Mr. Alvin Ang, among other things, that she had to reject the May to September 2019 timesheets as “_the names of the store personnel who acknowledged the attendance \[were\] not indicated_”. In response, Mr. Alvin Ang indicated that the meeting at which this requirement (indicating the names of the store supervisor on the time sheet) was discussed only took place on 9 October 2019. Thus, he would have challenges in obtaining the store supervisor’s names for the period prior to 9 October 2019[^18]. He asked for Ms. Low’s “help to take this into consideration”. In her reply dated 4 December 2019, Ms. Low stated that the “_instruction_ (to get hold of the names of the store supervisor) _was communicated to_ \[Mr. Alvin Ang\] in person in early August when \[he\] _sent_ \[her\] _the very first time sheet_”, however, Mr. Alvin Ang “_did not take_ \[Ms. Low’s\] _advice seriously, thus resulting in this situation_”[^19].

43     Viewing the email exchanges as a whole, it was evident that there was no clear consensus between Mr. Alvin Ang on one hand, and Ms. Chua and Ms. Low on the other, on the information that the timesheets had to reflect. Instead, it showed various proposals and counter proposals being exchanged and/or negotiated.

### Agreement of 6 December 2019

44     On 6 December 2019, Mr. Sean Lee sent an email to Mr. Alvin Ang, copied to Ms. Low, Mr. Soon and Mr. Cheong. The 6 December 2019 email was prefaced by the statement that “_We have finalised all the discussions points as per below, please shout if there are any areas unclear and move forward as planned_”. What followed was a summary of the agreed positions reached on the _hitherto_ open issues[^20]. There was no evidence that any of the addressees copied on the email sought clarifications, disputed or proposed changes to the contents of Mr. Sean Lee’s summary.

45     On the issue of the content of timesheets required to support the invoices, the agreement set out by Mr. Sean Lee in his 6 December email was as follows:

> “……

> **Deployment**

> a.     _Verification of timesheet/ time punch cards_ to include either of the 2 out of 3 components (_i.e._ Signature, Name and Store chop) **\[the “Additional Requirements”\]**

> b.    For _September / October 2019_ deployment

>> a.    Propose to _proceed with payment on September 19 based on submitted invoice and verification of deployment slots_

>> b.    Jump to provide supporting documents to Tohtonku (Singapore) _for filing purposes_ (_i.e._ time punch cards needs to include name/store chop)

> ………” _(Emphasis added)_ **\[not in original text; inserted for referencing purposes\]**

#### Invoices submitted post the 6 December 2019 Meeting

46     It was not severely disputed that the invoices and supporting documents submitted by the Plaintiff post the 6 December 2019 email were deemed satisfactory by the Defendant and were duly paid. The invoices paid after the 6 December meeting were as follows:

47     The last invoice submitted by the Plaintiff was for Deployments in the month of March 2020 as the Defendant had terminated the Contract with the Plaintiff effective from 31 March 2020[^22].

#### Termination of Mr. Sean Lee’s employment by the Defendant

48     It was evident from the documentary evidence that Mr. Lim was highly critical of Mr. Sean Lee’s handling of the Project. On 14 November 2019, Mr. Lim sent a WhatsApp message to Mr. Sean Lee expressing his “disappointment” over Mr. Sean Lee’s mishandling of the Project, including: (a) his failure to have the contract vetted by the Plaintiff’s inhouse legal counsel (to one Mr. Dean Tan) or Mr. Lim himself which led to _“some of the terms in the contract \[that were\] detrimental to the company \[which\] we will now need to rectify_”, (b) various “operation weakness” highlighted by Ms. Chua, and (c) that Mr. Sean Lee did not stop payment “when there weren’t proper validation”[^23]. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lee’s employment with the Plaintiff was terminated in or around December 2019.

## The Parties’ Case

### The Plaintiff’s claim

49     The Plaintiff called the following witnesses at trial:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="21.2848994296007%"> <col width="78.7151005703993%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Marking</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Witness</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">PW1</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Ang Meng Hwee Alvin (Mr. Alvin Ang)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">PW2</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lee Quan Feng Sean (Mr. Sean Lee)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

50     The Plaintiff’s case was that it had provided the Deployments to the Defendant under the Unpaid Invoices, and was accordingly entitled to be paid for the same. The Plaintiff noted that it was unchallenged at trial that the Plaintiff had made payments to the BAs pursuant to these Deployments, but the Defendant had now withheld payments to the Plaintiff for the same.

51     The Plaintiff pointed out that it was _not_ the Defendant’s case that the Plaintiff had failed to provide any of the Deployments stated in the Unpaid Invoices. Rather, the entire basis of the Defendant’s defence was that the punch cards and/or timesheets provided by the Plaintiff in support of the Unpaid Invoices did “not reflect the name of store’s person-in-charge” (the “**Store IC Name Requirement**”). Indeed, all the challenged deployment slots singled out by the Defendant as constituting the basis of the Defendant’s Defence and/or Counterclaim involved timesheet and/or punch card entries that were not accompanied by the names of the outlet supervisors (_i.e._ only the signature of the outlet supervisor was affixed): see Annexure A and B of the Defence & Counterclaim (Amendment No. 1)[^24].

52     The Plaintiff argued that the Store IC Name Requirement was not a prerequisite to payment under the Invoices. It was neither an express term of the contract, nor was it reasonable for the Defendant to contend that the Store IC requirement must be fulfilled before the Defendant could be “satisfied” under Clause 3(i) that “work has been performed” in accordance with the Contract. This was so as the Plaintiff had already provided sufficient particulars to substantiate the Deployments under the Unpaid invoices, including the name and location of the stores, the date and time of work performed by the Deployments, the signatures and/or acknowledgements of the relevant store supervisors, _etc._.

53     Given that the Store IC Name Requirement was not a term of the Contract at its inception, the Defendant could not unilaterally impose this requirement as a term of the parties’ contract without the Plaintiff’s consent. The Store IC Name Requirement (which was a component of the Additional Requirements) was only finally agreed on 6 December 2019 after rounds of discussions, as evidenced by an email from Mr. Sean Lee of the same date. The requirement was further intended to be of prospective application only. Indeed, the evidence showed that the Plaintiff had complied with the Additional Requirements for invoices tendered after the 6 December 2019 email and no issues were raised by the Defendant in respect of these later invoices.

54     Even if the Store IC Name requirement was as condition precedent to the Plaintiff’s entitlement to payment for the Deployments, the Plaintiff contended that it was still entitled to claim against the Defendant for the work performed in _quantum meirut_. Additionally, the Plaintiff argued that the Defendant had waived the Store IC Name Requirement in respect of the first six Invoices, or was estopped from raising the Store IC Name Requirement in respect of these six Invoices for the May to October 2019 Deployments as the Plaintiff had relied on the Defendant’s representation (by conduct) when the Defendant paid the first four invoices without insisting on having sight and/or receiving copies of timesheets that met this requirement.

### The Defendant’s Defence and Counterclaim

#### The Defence

55     The Defendant called the following witnesses at trial:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.6221109966142%"> <col width="81.3778890033859%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Marking</u></b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>Witness</u></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DW1</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Low Gaik Ling, Elyn (Ms. Low)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DW2</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lim Chee Keong (Mr. Lim aka Jasper Lim)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

56     The Defendant had originally intended to call Mr. Soon as a third witness and had in fact filed Mr. Soon’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief prior to the start of the trial. The Defendant’s counsel, however, informed the court after the trial had started that Mr. Soon would not be called, without providing any reasons. Mr. Soon’s affidavit was accordingly expunged from the trial records.

57     The Defendant’s case was that based on an objective interpretation of the Contract, timesheets had to be submitted to the Defendant for verification, and the Defendant had to be “satisfied” that work had been carried out by the Deployments before it was obliged to pay on the Plaintiff’s invoices. The Defendant, having verified the timesheets submitted in respect of the 5th and 6th Invoices, had found the timesheets to be incomplete and/or invalid. Pursuant to Clause 3(i) of the Contract, the Defendant was not “satisfied” that the work relating to the affected Deployments had been carried out in accordance with the agreement, and was therefore under no obligation to pay for the September and October Deployments[^25].

#### The Counterclaim

58     The Defendant’s case in its counterclaim was that it should be entitled to claw back the sum of $260,763.28 (out of the $335,560.28) paid to the Plaintiff for the May to August 2019 Deployments. The Defendant’s counterclaim is founded on a breach of contract, further and/or in the alternative, for total and/or partial failure of consideration by the Plaintiff. The basis of the Counterclaim mirrored that of the Defence, namely that the Defendant was dissatisfied that work had been carried out for selected Deployments covered under the first four invoices as they did not fulfill the Additional Requirements, specifically, the Store IC Name Requirement.

59     The Defendant’s Counterclaim in the aggregate amount $260,763.28 was based on timesheet entries that bore the signature, but not the name, of the relevant outlet supervisors, and is broken down as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="33.5763165724487%"> <col width="32.3564415352574%"> <col width="34.067241892294%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Deployment Month</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total number of Slots disputed by the Defendant</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sum unaccounted for (including 7% GST)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">May 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">268</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$47,028.64</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">June 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">339</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$59,312.24</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">July 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">424</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$74,403.52</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">August 2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">456</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">$80,018.88</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>TOTAL</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>1487</b></p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>$260,763.28</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

60     The Defendant contended that the Deployments’ timesheets for the May to August deployment months were supposed to have accompanied each of the invoices sent to the Defendant, to allow the Defendant to verify the same. However, the timesheets were not forthcoming. In the interim, as each invoice had a credit term of 30 days and late penalty clauses, the Defendant made payments on the first four invoices to the Plaintiff on a “goodwill basis”. However, having verified the timesheets when they were finally received, the Defendant was not “satisfied” with the supporting documents for a number of Deployments. Pursuant to Clause 3(i) of the Contract, the Plaintiff was therefore not entitled to payment for the affected Deployments. To the extent the Defendant had already paid Plaintiff for the same, the Defendant was entitled to a refund of these payments.

## My Decision

61     At the conclusion of the trial, I allowed the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant. I accordingly also dismissed the Defendant’s counterclaim in its entirety.

62     I found as follows:

> (a)     There was an inherent ambiguity when Clause 2 (_Conclusive Evidence Clause_) and Clause 3(i) (_Payment Clause_) of the Contract were read together. The ambiguity was not one that could be resolved (and not merely that it was difficult to resolve) by interpreting them in the context of the overall contract. Hence, the _contra proferentem_ rule applied, and any contractual ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the contract, here, the Plaintiff. In this regard, Clause 3(i) should therefore prevail over Clause 2 to the extent necessary to resolve any inconsistency.

> (b)     Even with the application of the _contra proferentem rule_ to resolve the conflict between Clause 2 and Clause 3(i), there remained inherent ambiguities within Clause 3(i) itself. Applying a contextual interpretation of Clause 3(i), I found that Clause 3(i) should be objectively construed to mean:

>> “Tohtonku shall make prompt settlement of the invoiced amounts at the agreed rates, unless Tohtonku is not reasonably satisfied that the work has been performed in accordance with the terms of this agreement”.

> (c)     I further found that the supporting documents provided by the Plaintiff (see \[128\] below) contained significant particulars which ought to have been sufficient for the Defendant to verify whether the work claimed in the Deployments had been performed. The Defendant had not shown why it was not reasonably satisfied that work has been performed in accordance with the agreement despite the significant particulars provided by the Plaintiff, and had instead doggedly insisted that the Additional Requirements (in particular, the Store IC Name Requirement) be fulfilled.

> (d)     The Additional Requirements were not part of the original Contract between the parties at the inception of the Contract. It was open to the Parties to vary the Contract by introducing the Additional Requirements. Such variation must, however, be by mutual agreement. The evidence suggested that parties were negotiating the scope of the Additional Requirements all the way up to around 6 December 2019 when a final position was agreed. The agreement reached was to apply prospectively only. The Additional Requirements therefore did not need to be fulfilled for the September and October deployments, which were the subject matter of the Unpaid Invoices. They also did not need to be fulfilled for the May to August 2019 Deployments which formed the subject matter of the Counterclaim.

63     The Defendant is dissatisfied with my decision and has filed the present appeal against my decision. I have therefore set out my detailed grounds for allowing the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant, and for dismissing the Defendant’s Counterclaim, below.

## The Issues

64     In the present case, the issues to be determined are as follows:

> (a)     How should the ambiguities in the Contract, specifically those within and between Clause 2 and Clause 3(i), be resolved?

> (b)     Were the Additional Requirements part of the original Contract?

> (c)     If the answer to (b) is in the negative, what were the precise terms of the Additional Requirements that were subsequently agreed between the parties, and when did they take effect?

> (d)     Were the supporting documents provided by the Plaintiff for the May to October Deployments sufficient for the Defendant to verify and be reasonably “satisfied” as to whether work under the Deployments has been performed in accordance with the Contract?

## Issue 1: How should ambiguities in the Contract be resolved?

65     It is clear to a reader that both Clause 2 and Clause 3(i) of the Contract were very poorly drafted. Both clauses were incomplete, grammatically and linguistically unsound and/or vague as to their meaning.

### The “Conclusive Evidence clause”

66     While Clause 2 purported to operate as a “conclusive evidence” clause, it did not state exactly _what_ document or information shall be deemed to be final and conclusive as between the parties.

67     The Plaintiff and Defendant were, however, in agreement that having regard to the heading of Clause 2, the clause should be interpreted to mean “the _time records and invoices_ submitted to Tohtonku shall be conclusive and binding”[^26]. I agreed that based on an objective construction of Clause 2, such an interpretation was supportable, especially when one took into account the heading of Clause 2.

68     The concession by the parties was however insufficient, in and of itself, to lead to the conclusion that Clause 2 should be properly regarded as a conclusive evidence clause. As the High Court noted in _ABN AMRO Clearing Bank NV v 1050 Capital Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 271</span>, whether a clause is properly to be regarded as a “conclusive evidence clause”, and what that clause is conclusive in respect of, must depend on the facts of each case (at \[35\]). Citing _Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[1986\] AC 80</span>, the High Court noted that a rigorous test must be satisfied when conclusive evidence clauses are concerned. Thus, where a party seeks to rely on conclusive evidence clauses as a defence against challenges, it is incumbent on the party to provide it in “clear and unambiguous” language (at \[43\]).

### The Payment Clause

69     Here, despite the parties’ agreement that Clause 2 should be construed in the manner set out in \[67\] above, this still did not remove the ambiguity when Clause 2 was read together with the Payment Clause contained in Clause 3(i). Clause 3(i) provided that the Defendant shall pay on the invoices when “\[the Defendant\] is satisfied that that the work has been performed in accordance with \[the\] agreement”. Naturally, the “time records and invoices” cannot be conclusive as set out in Clause 2, _if_ the Defendant’s “satisfaction” with the works performed is also a condition for payment by virtue of Clause 3(i) of the Contract. In my mind, the manner in which Clause 2 was drafted, when construed against the terms of the Contract as a whole (in particular Clause 3(i)), would not pass the rigorous test required of conclusive evidence clauses.

### Reconciling Clause 2 and Clause 3(i)

70     Given the two seemingly conflicting clauses, the role of the court was to ascertain how the provisions should be construed.

71     As a starting point, the courts do not expect all commercial documents to be drafted with outmost precision and certainty. To take such an approach would strike down bargains legitimately reached between parties who might not have been so astute as to legal precision or certainty: see The _Law of Contract in Singapore_ (Andrew Phang Gen Editor, 2012) at \[03.148\]. The House of Lords thus noted in _Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd_ (1932) 147 LT 503 at 514:

> “Businessmen often record the most important agreements in crude and summary fashion ….\[which are\] far from complete and precise. It is accordingly the duty of the court to construe such documents fairly and broadly, without being too astute or subtle in finding defects, but instead the court should seek to apply the old maxim of English law, _verba ita sunt intelligenda ut res magis valeat quam pereat_. The maxim, however, does not mean that the court is to make a contract for the parties, or to go outside the words they have used, except in so far as they are appropriate implication of law”.

#### The Contra Proferentem Rule

72     A rule of construction of contracts relevant in the present case is the _contra proferentem rule_. It is trite that “… \[c\]ourts now generally regard the _contra proferentem_ rule (as it is called) as one of last resort because it is widely accepted that it is preferable that judges should struggle with the words actually used as applied to the unique circumstances of the case and reach their own conclusions by reference to the logic of the matter, rather than by using mechanical formulae”: see Kirby J in the Australian High Court decision of _McCann v Switzerland Insurance Australia Ltd and Others_ (2000) 176 ALR 711 at \[74(4)\]. The conditions for applying the _contra proferentem_ rule were thus stated by the Court of Appeal in _Hewlett-Packard Singapore (Sales) Pte Ltd v Chin Shu Hwa Corinna_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGCA 19</span> (“**_Corinna Chin_**”) in the following terms:

> “51 At this juncture, it is apposite for us to reiterate that in order for the _contra proferentem_ rule to apply, it is a necessary condition that there be an ambiguity in the contract which _cannot be resolved_ (and _not merely_ that it is _difficult_ to resolve) by interpreting the term in the context of the overall contract. The rule cannot apply to create an ambiguity where one does not exist ……” _(emphasis added)_

73     Applying the above principles, I am of the view that the ambiguity in the Contract, specifically between Clause 2 and Clause 3(i), was not one that could be resolved, and not merely that it was difficult to resolve, by interpreting the terms in the context of the overall contract. The references to “payment supported by accurate invoices” and “when the \[Defendant\] is satisfied that work has been performed in accordance with the contract” in Clause 3(i) were simply irreconcilable with the purported conclusive nature of the “time records and invoicing” issued by the Plaintiff as set out in Clause 2. The present case was thus one in which the _contra proferentem_ rule would apply.

74     In the present case, it was not disputed that the Contract was drafted by the Plaintiff (Mr. Alvin Ang). As it was impossible to reconcile the inherent contradictions between Clause 2 and Clause 3(i), any doubts as to which provision should prevail in the event of a conflict should be resolved against the Plaintiff to the extent of any ambiguity. Indeed, the Plaintiff had confirmed in their closings submissions they were not relying on the conclusive evidence clause in Clause 2.

### Interpretation of the Payment Clause

75     Having concluded that Clause 3(i) prevails over Clause 2 to the extent of any conflict, I noted that Clause 3(i) was very vaguely drafted as well. Apart from being grammatically unsound and linguistically convoluted, the reference to the Defendant being “satisfied” that work has been performed was also inherently vague.

#### The legal principles

76     The principles governing the construction of contractual provisions are well established. A contextual approach to the interpretation of contracts, which included looking at the surrounding context as well as the purpose of the agreement would be adopted. As the Court of Appeal noted in _Corinna Chan’s_ case at \[53\] and \[55\]:

> “53 …… Put simply, therefore, everything depends on an _objective interpretation_ of the term by the court itself. As Chadwick LJ aptly put it in the English Court of Appeal decision of _Bromarin AB and another v IMD Investments Ltd_ \[1999\] STC 301 (at 310):

>> _…… It is an exercise which requires the court to look at the whole agreement which the parties made, the words which they used and the circumstances in which they used them, and to ask what should reasonable parties be taken to have intended by the use of those words in that agreement, made in those circumstances, in relation to this event which they did not in fact foresee._

> ……

> 55    Pursuant to the _objective_ principle of interpretation, the court is concerned with the _expressed intentions of the parties_, and _not_ their _subjective intentions_. The standpoint adopted is that of a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were _at the time the contract was formed_. The extrinsic material sought to be admitted must always go towards proof of what the parties, from an objective viewpoint, ultimately agreed upon.” _(emphasis added)_

77     In _Zurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 3 SLR(R) 1029</span> (“**_Zurich Insurance_**”), the Court of Appeal set out the canons of construction relating to the contextual approach to contract interpretation in the following terms (at \[151\] - only those applicable to the case at hand have been reproduced below):

> _“The aim of construction_

> First, the aim of the exercise of construction of a contract or other document is to ascertain the meaning which it would convey to a reasonable business person.

> _The objective principle_

> Secondly, the _objective principle_ is therefore critical in defining the approach the courts will take. _They are concerned usually with the expressed intentions of a person, not his or her actual intentions. The standpoint adopted is that of a reasonable reader_. ….

> _The holistic or ‘whole contract’ approach_

> Thirdly, the exercise is one based on the _whole contract_ or an _holistic approach. Courts are not excessively focused upon a particular word, phrase, sentence, or clause. Rather the emphasis is on the document or utterance as a whole._

> _The contextual dimension_

> Fourthly, the exercise in construction is informed by the _surrounding circumstances_ or _external context_. Modern judges are prepared to look beyond the four corners of a document, or the bare words of an utterance. It is permissible to have regard to the legal, regulatory, and factual matrix which constitutes the background in which the document was drafted or the utterance was made.

> _Business purpose_

> Fifthly, within this framework due consideration is given to the _commercial purpose_ of the transaction or provision. The courts have regard to the overall purpose of the parties with respect to a particular transaction, or more narrowly the reason why a particular obligation was undertaken.

> _…._

> _Avoiding unreasonable results_

> Eighthly, a construction which leads to _very unreasonable results_ is to be avoided unless it is required by clear words and there is no other tenable construction.

> _\[emphasis added\]_

#### Objective Interpretation of the Payment Clause

78     Applying the above principles of construction, any contention that the Defendant should have an absolute _unfettered discretion_ to determine if it was “satisfied” with the work done would not be justifiable based on a holistic or “whole contract” approach of interpretation of contracts, which states that courts must not excessively focus on a word, provision or sentence but on the document as a whole: see _Zurich Insurance_. Here, it could not be disputed the Contract purported to include a conclusive evidence clause in the Plaintiff’s favour by way of Clause 2. While I have concluded above that Clause 2 should be construed against the drafter to the extent necessary to resolve any conflict with Clause 3(i), Clause 2 ought not, in my view, be completely ignored when interpreting the ambit of Clause 3(i).

79     Any contention that the Defendant had carte blanche discretion to determine whether the invoices and the supporting documents were to its satisfaction would, in my mind, defeat the commercial purpose of the Contract by allowing the Defendant to impose arbitrary and/or onerous conditions which the Plaintiff might have significant difficulties complying with. The context under which the Contract was entered into was further one in which the parties were rushing to finalize the Contract and to commence the Deployments. Indeed, both the Plaintiff’s Mr. Alvin Ang and the Defendant’s Mr. Sean Lee’s testimonies were that they did not really direct their minds to the supporting documents that would be needed for verification and payment purposes at the time the Contract was entered into. In this context, the contention that the Defendant ought to be able to dictate all the supporting documents and information that it would require to be provided with before it would be _satisfied_ that work has been done in accordance with the agreement, without regard to the practical challenges that the Plaintiff might face in providing them, was so unreasonable that it could not have been the objective intention of the parties.

80     Applying the canons of construction referred above, and giving due regard to Clause 2, I am of the view that Clause 3.1, objectively construed, should be interpreted to mean the following:

> “Tohtonku shall make prompt settlement of the invoiced amounts at the agreed rates, unless Tohtonku is not _reasonably satisfied_ that the work has been performed in accordance with the terms of this agreement”.

81     The standpoint adopted must be that of a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time the Contract was formed, and asking what such a reasonable person would have deemed to be satisfactory proof of the work done: see _Corrina Chan_ at \[55\].

82     The above construction of Clause 3(i) would, in my view, also give effect to the maxim _verba ita sunt intelligenda ut res magis valeat quam pereat_ (_i.e._ words are to be understood such that the subject matter may be more effective than wasted) by giving some effect to Clause 2.

## Issue 2: Were the Additional Requirements part of the original Contract?

### Supporting documents required to be furnished by Plaintiff

83     Based on both the wordings of the Original Contract and an objective reading of Clause 3.1 as set out in \[80\] above, it was clear that it was _not_ expressly specified in the original Contract what the specific Supporting Documents required to substantiate payment were at the inception of the Contract.

#### Whether timesheets were required?

84     The position taken by the Defendant at trial was that it was a contractual requirement that _all_ invoices must be supported by timesheets and/or punch cards (hereinafter, collectively, “**timesheets**”). This was so as under Clause 3.1, the Defendant was only obliged to make payment if it were satisfied that work had been performed in accordance with the terms of the Contract. The Deployments’ timesheets were necessary to enable the Defendant to verify and be satisfied that the Deployments set out in the invoices had indeed been carried out.

85     The Plaintiff’s initial position as stated in their Statement of Claim[^27] and Mr. Alvin Ang’s affidavit[^28] was that the only Supporting Documents required to be provided were the Summary Schedules. In the Plaintiff’s reply submissions, the Plaintiff eventually conceded that apart from the Summary Schedules, some additional supporting information in the form of the collected time sheets or punch cards were also required to be furnished to the Defendant to allow them to be reasonably satisfied as to the work for which they were being billed[^29].

86     In my mind, the concession by the Plaintiff was rightly made as there were evidence to suggest that some supporting information over and above the Summary Schedules were required.

87     First, in Mr. Sean Lee’s internal email to Mr. Soon, Mr. Cheong and Ms. Low dated 11 July 2019, which was sent after the first invoice from the Plaintiff was received, Mr. Sean Lee reminded Ms. Low to “monitor for supporting documents”. Under the “Promoter Deployment” heading, Mr. Sean Lee expressly stated that ‘_Actual Deployment \[was to be supported\] with timesheets/log cards_”[^30].

88     That Mr. Alvin Ang and Mr. Sean Lee were _ad idem_ that timesheets were required was also borne out by Mr. Alvin Ang’s email dated 20 August 2019[^31], in which he forwarded to Ms. Low the timesheets the Plaintiff had collected back for the July 2019 deployments. Subsequently, timesheets for the May and June 2019 Deployments were also forwarded to Ms. Low on 14 October 2019[^32], and the August Deployment timesheets on 29 October 2019[^33]. In his 8 October 2019 email to Mr. Cheong, Mr. Alvin Ang also represented to Mr. Cheong that he had been emailing timesheets “diligently” to Ms. Low[^34].

89     In any event, based on an objective reading of Clause 3.1, an objective reader, in the context of the present transaction, must have understood that some supporting proof in the form of timesheets acknowledged by the Outlets would be required to supplement the Summary Schedules. This was necessary to allow the Defendant to validate the Summary Schedules against the timesheets collected and be satisfied that the invoiced amounts were in fact correct.

90     Viewed in their totality, I am therefore of the view that as at the date of the Original Contract, the parties were _ad idem_ that the Summary Schedules would need to be accompanied by the deployment timesheets for the Defendant’s verification purposes.

#### What were the contents of the timesheets required?

91     The above, however, did not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the parties were therefore similarly _ad idem_ as to the exact information the timesheets should contain. Based on the evidence before me, I found that at the time the original Contract was entered into, there was _no_ common understanding as to the format/content of the timesheets, in particular whether they should contain the Additional Requirements. I considered the following.

92     First, the objective facts suggested that the signatories to the contract (_i.e._ Mr. Sean Lee and Mr. Alvin Ang) never applied their minds to the issue of the nature of Supporting Documents needed at the point of contracting. Thus, in Mr. Sean Lee’s email of 4 Mar 2019 enclosing a copy of the signed original Contract, Ms. Low was specifically asked to “_advise if there are any other documents that will be required …. for payment purposes_”.[^35]

93     Secondly, while Ms. Low was asked to advise as to the documents that the Defendant would require for payment purposes, there were no documentary records, such as email or text exchanges, in which Ms. Low clearly outlined the details and format of the supporting documents that the Defendant required. Indeed, in her affidavit, Ms. Low was equally vague as to the requirements the supporting documents must meet. Ms. Low stated at paragraph 18 and 19 of her affidavit:

> “18.  During the initial meetings and correspondence between TTK Singapore and Jump, both parties were clear on the requirement for complete and valid Supporting documents to be furnished by Jump to TTK Singapore so that the invoices sent by Jump could be verified accordingly.

> 19.     _The supporting documents would enable us to ensure / verify whether the band ambassadors procured by Jump had actually carried out their work including but not limited to the following:_

>> _a_.    Time sheets of the brand ambassadors approved or _signed by their outlet supervisor;_

>> b.    Time cards of the brand ambassadors punched;

>> _c_.     _Being able to clearly establish the identity of each individual Deployment.” (emphasis added)_

94     In her affidavit, it was evident that Ms. Low made no specific mention of the need for the corporate stamp of the outlet and/or the names of the outlet supervisor to be obtained (in addition to their signatures). Paragraph 19(c) was especially vague as to what supporting documents the Defendant needed so as to be able “to clearly establish the identity of each individual Deployment”.

95     Thirdly, I also did not think that the email of 4 December 2019 from Ms. Low to Mr. Alvin Ang[^36] - in which Ms. Low mentioned to Mr. Alvin Ang she had allegedly communicated to Mr. Alvin Ang in person when the very first timesheet was received in _early August_ that the name of the store personnel was needed - assisted the Defendant. First, this was no more than a bare assertion by Ms. Low. Furthermore, a unilateral demand, post contract, that such a requirement was needed did not make it a strict contractual obligation unless Mr. Alvin Ang had by words or conduct expressly agreed to the request. There was a complete absence of evidence of Mr. Alvin Ang’s assent to Ms. Low’s request[^37]. Instead, there was an email from Mr. Alvin Ang to Ms. Low dated 5 November 2019 in which Mr. Alvin Ang highlighted the practical challenges faced by the Plaintiff arising from the Defendant’s request that either company stamps or the names of the store supervisors be obtained, and stating his belief that these requirements were not in place previously:

> _“\[Plaintiff is\] still facing some problems in getting the store to either get stamps or indicate their names_, … at times the challenge that store comments are ‘if your company doesn’t believe, get them to come down” \[B\]ut we are working to resolve this….. _While we are supportive towards change and improvements, I’m also certain in the past this wasn’t in place_” _[^38]_. _(emphasis added)_

96     Fourthly, Mr. Sean Lee further deposed in his affidavit that he had specifically checked with Mr. Soon, the Plaintiff’s Head of Marketing, when the 1st invoice dated 4 June 2019 for the May deployment was received, whether the invoices needed to be accompanied by any other documents. According to Mr. Sean Lee, Mr. Soon’s reply was that the Summary Schedule was sufficient for the purposes of making payment on the invoice[^39]. Again, no discussion of any other supporting documents appeared to have crossed the minds of Mr. Soon and Mr. Sean Lee. If the Defendant’s contention was that Mr. Sean Lee’s testimony on this point was false, the onus was on the Defendant to call Mr. Soon as a witness to testify to this fact. However, Defendant chose not to call Mr. Soon, despite having filed an affidavit pre-trial. In my view, this warranted the drawing of an adverse inference under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997 Rev Ed) that if Mr. Soon were called, his evidence would have been unfavourable to the Defendant.

97     Fifthly, at paragraph 20 of Ms. Low’s affidavit, she deposed that there was a meeting in late May and early June 2019 between Mr. Alvin Ang, Mandy Wong (Mr. Alvin Ang’s colleague), Mr. Sean Lee, Mr. Soon and Mr. Cheong where “the requirement for complete and valid supporting document were made known to \[the Plaintiff\]”. Ms. Low was not at the meeting but according to her, Mr. Soon and Mr. Cheong were. The latter would have been best placed to refute Mr. Alvin Ang and Mr. Sean Lee’s evidence that the prescribed requirements for the timesheets were never discussed or agreed upon at the inception of the contract. However, Defendant chose not to call both Mr. Soon and Mr. Cheong. Mr. Alvin Ang and Mr. Sean Lee’s testimonies on this point therefore remain unrebutted.

98     Sixthly, the email exchanges involving the Defendant from October 2019 suggested to me that Tohtonku did not even have a consistent internal position on what the Additional Requirements were when the topic was first surfaced in October 2019. For instance:

> (a)     Ms. Chua initially stated in her email of 13 November 2019 that all timesheets needed to be “chopped signed by outlet personnel”[^40]. When told by Mr. Alvin Ang on 14 November 2019 that requiring the outlet’s chop would be challenging, she then required the name and NRIC of the store personnel in circumstances where the outlet chop could not be procured[^41].

> (b)     In contrast, Mr. Cheong (the Head of Sales) had earlier, in his email of 17 October 2019, stated that _outlet stamps were not necessary_, and that the proper documentation should include the signature of the promoter, the name of the outlet and the outlet supervisor’s _acknowledgment[^42]_. Notably, no reference was made by Mr. Cheong as to the need for: (i) the _name_ of the outlet supervisor specifically (as opposed to an _acknowledgement, such as by way of a signature_); (ii) any outlet chop and/or (iii) NRIC of the outlet personnel. Indeed, based on the requirements articulated by Mr. Cheong in his email of 17 October 2019, all the challenged timesheets would have fulfilled Mr. Cheong’s requirements.

99     Seventhly, that the Additional Requirements were not part of the original Contract was most evident from Ms. Chua’s email of 13 November 2019. In paragraph 1 of the email, Ms. Chua stated that the one of the immediate focus areas was to “_revise_ _the existing agreement between Jump and Tohtonku SG, with Dean_ \[_viz_, the Plaintiff’s inhouse legal counsel\] _taking the lead to_ _revisit_ _all clauses in the agreement_”[^43]. Ms. Chua goes on to set out the _supporting requirements_ Tohtonku wanted in paragraph 2 of her email. The clear inference was that there was no _consensus_ that the Additional Requirements were part of the contract to begin with, and hence the need to revisit the original Contract to specifically incorporate these requirements.

#### Four prior payments made without insistence on the Additional Requirements

100    A further hurdle the Defendant needed to overcome was the fact that it did, as a matter of fact, pay on four invoices (for the deployments in May through August 2019) in full prior to 9 October 2019 without insisting on receiving timesheets that fulfilled the Additional Requirements. The Defendant sought to explain this away on the basis that the earlier payments were made on a “goodwill basis”, despite the Defendant not being furnished with and/or having verified the timesheets in respect of the Deployments: see Ms. Low’s affidavit at \[135\]. Ms. Low claimed that, among other things, Mr. Alvin Ang was anxious to receive payment for invoices that had been issued and had repeatedly followed up with her on payment: see Ms. Low’s affidavit at \[17(a)-(e)\][^44]. Furthermore, the payment term of the invoices incorporated a 30-day credit period. The Defendant would risk having to pay late payment charges if the payment was not made within the payment grace period.

#### Whether first four invoices paid on a “good-will” basis?

101    I did not find the Defendant’s assertion that payment on the first four invoices were made on a goodwill basis convincing at all. First, there was not a single shred of evidence (_e.g._ an email or WhatsApp message) from the Defendant stating clearly to the Plaintiff that the first four payments were made on a goodwill basis pending sight and verification of the timesheets, and reserving the Defendant’s rights in the meantime.

102    Secondly, the fact that Mr. Alvin Ang had been sending chasers to Ms. Low regarding the payment of the Plaintiff’s invoices was at most a neutral factor. Such chasers are commonplace in trade or commercial dealings. It would require a quantum leap to conclude from the fact that payment chasers were sent by Mr. Alvin Ang, that the Plaintiff was therefore in financial difficulties, and that when Ms. Low effected the invoice payments, she therefore did so out of goodwill.

103    Thirdly, the Defendant’s alternate explanation that the Defendant had paid out of goodwill as it was concerned about incurring late payment charges was also inherently contradictory. If the Contract indeed provided that verification of timesheets to the satisfaction of the Defendant was a precondition to payment, then there was no reason why the Defendant should be concerned about not paying within the 30-day limit, especially if the reason for the late payment was due to the Plaintiff’s delay in compiling and submitting complete timesheets.

104    In this regard, I also did not find that Mr. Alvin Ang’s email dated 18 July 2019 thanking Ms. Low for “\[taking\] the step to help \[the Plaintiff\] expedite \[the payment\] when she “could have just \[stuck\] to the situation” was evidence of any goodwill extended by Ms. Low to Mr. Alvin Ang[^45]. A proper reading of the email suggested that Mr. Alvin Ang was thanking Ms. Low for processing payment based on an electronic copy (as opposed to the original hardcopy) of the Tohtonku Malaysia’s Bank Information Form (BIF). It had nothing to do with the sufficiency of the invoices and supporting documents provided by the Plaintiff. This comported with Mr. Alvin Ang’s explanation at trial as well[^46].

105    Based on the foregoing, I found that the Additional Requirements were not part of the Contract at its inception.

## Issue 3: Terms of the Additional Requirements subsequently agreed upon

### Developments in October 2019 onwards

106    In view of my conclusion that the Additional Requirements were not part of the original contractual requirements, any post-contractual introduction of new terms into the Contract by the Defendant would not be binding unless the Plaintiff’s consent were obtained.

107    Ms. Chua from Tohtonku (Malaysia) appeared to have taken the lead in the negotiations, which were evidenced by the chain of emails exchanged between 13 November 2019 and 15 November 2019 among, _inter alia_, Ms. Chua, Mr. Alvin Ang, and Ms. Low, with Mr. Sean Lee, Mr. Lim, Mr. Cheong, Ms. Jowey Lim and Mr. Dean Tan being kept in the loop (the “**13-15 November email exchanges**”)[^47]. Viewing the emails as a whole, it was clear to me that parties _did not_ reach any agreement on the precise terms of the Additional Requirements as at end October/November 2019.

108    For instance, in relation to Ms. Chua’s request that the timesheets be “chopped signed”, Mr. Alvin Ang’s position was that it was agreed at a discussion a day before that the agreed requirement was _either_ to get (a) the company chop, _or_ (b) the name and signature of the store in charge[^48]. Getting the store’s chop was not mandatory. He mentioned he had flagged practical “challenges” about getting store stamps previously when he rejected this requirement[^49].

109    As for Ms. Chua’s counterproposal that if the company chop were not available, the store personnel’s NRIC and name should be provided, this was similarly not agreed to by Mr. Alvin Ang. Mr. Alvin Ang’s reason was that he foresaw difficulties in getting “personnel details” like NRIC from the store personnel who were not under his “control or supervision”[^50].

110    That Mr. Alvin Ang did not accept all of Ms. Chua’s demands was also evident from his email of 15 November 2019 where he asked Ms. Chua in cases where information – such as the outlet chop, or NRIC of the outlet supervisor – could not be obtained from certain locations, whether the Plaintiff should stop deployments at those locations with immediate effect. This, in my view, was further evidence of the ongoing negotiations between the parties, with Mr. Alvin Ang communicating the practical challenges he had to deal with and the requirements which he was unable to commit to. There did not appear to be any reply from the Defendant or Tohtonku (Malaysia) to Mr. Alvin Ang’s query.

111    Indeed, Mr. Alvin Ang’s email to Ms. Chua of 15 November 2019 in response to her demands to incorporate various additional requirements pertaining to the timesheets suggested he was trying his best to accommodate her requests, but was unable to accede to all of them. The following portions of his email are telling:

> “Thanks for your patience and I seek your understanding to tolerate me for a while more _so that I can clearly understand what are the next steps that Jump as a whole need to take_ to ensure the partnership is moving forward towards a positive experience and not a tug of war…..

> I would like to put forth once more that I am supportive of the request as _so far I have been trying my best to follow what’s requested however it is my duty to highlight trade challenges_…….

> That been said, _I’d like to know with immediate effect, if the location that I am not confident of obtaining, should I carry on deploying with immediate effect?....._

> _I am speaking on behalf of knowing what is possible to execute and adhere too and what is difficult_, most of the points I’ve agreed are areas Jump is able to support / improve or try to innovate. However _personnel details etc especially talking about Staffs from stores which are not within any of my control or supervision, I’m very very worried and doubtful_.

> _Please advise me on my questions so that I can take effective measures from further possible damaging effects on both parties_ especially since the burden of justification is on Jump’s shoulders………. ” \] _(emphasis added)_

112    These emails viewed holistically suggested that there was no clear consensus reached on what the Additional Requirements were at the end of the October/November discussions, especially in relation to a situation where the outlet did not affix the company chop and declined to provide the NRIC of the supervisor.

### Agreement on Additional Requirements

113    In my judgement, consensus on what supporting documents were required was only reached on or around 6 December 2019, as evidenced by Mr. Sean Lee’s email of the same date. The email, which was addressed to, _inter alia_, Mr. Alvin Ang, Ms. Low, Mr. Soon, Kevin Cheong and Tohtonku’s accounts department, stated that the ‘finalised position’ as regard the timesheet and payment issues were as follows (the “**Supplemental Agreement**”)[^51]. There was no evidence that any of the parties copied on the email chain disagreed with the agreed position summarized by Mr. Sean Lee:

> **“Deployment**

> a.    Verification of timesheet/ time punch cards to include either of the 2 out of 3 components (_i.e._ Signature, Name and Store chop)

> b.    For September / October 2019 deployment

>> a.    Propose to _proceed with payment on September 19 based on submitted invoice and verification of deployment slots_

>> b.    Jump to provide supporting documents to Tohtonku (Singapore) _for filing purposes_ (_i.e._ time punch cards needs to include name/store chop)

>> …” _(Emphasis added)_

### Whether the agreed Additional Requirements had retrospective effect?

#### Specific provisions relating to the September/October deployments

114    The key term introduced by the Supplemental Agreement was that the time sheets must include two of the following three components: (a) signature of store supervisor, (b) name of store supervisor; and (c) store chop (the **_“Additional Requirements”_**). It was, however, not expressly stated whether the requirements were to apply prospectively or retrospectively.

115    Specific provision was, however, made for payment on the September and October deployments which remained unpaid as at 6 December 2019. Specifically, for the September and October deployments, it was provided that the Defendant shall pay based on the “submitted invoice and verification of _deployment slots_”, and that “the _supporting documents_ (timesheets with name/store chop) will be provided for “_filing purposes_”. It is notable that in paragraph b(a) of the Supplemental Agreement, verification was stated to be based on “deployment slots” and not “time sheets”.

116    Based on an objective reading of paragraph (b) of the Supplemental Agreement, the objective understanding of the parties must have been that payment of the September/October deployments would be treated differently from the arrangements set out in paragraph (a), failing which paragraph (b) would be wholly redundant. Based on an objective reading of paragraph (b), references to payment for the September/October being “based on submitted invoice and verification of deployment slots” must, in my view, objectively mean that payment would be based primarily on the Summary Schedules and the then available timesheets (which _need not_ incorporate the Additional Requirements). This interpretation was fortified by paragraph b(b) of the Supplemental Agreement which stated that “supporting documents … (_i.e._ time punch cards needs to include “name/store chop”)” would be provided for “_filing purposes_” only. In my opinion, the objective understanding of the Supplemental Agreement must be that the Additional Requirements in paragraph (a) would not be applied to the September and October deployments. If they did, then the September and October deployments would be covered by paragraph (a) as well, rendering paragraph (b) completely otiose.

117    As a side note, I am cognizant that paragraph b(a) of the Supplemental Agreement did not make specific reference to the _October_ deployment. However, based on an objective construction of paragraph (b), this was likely to have been a mere slip. Having regard to the heading of paragraph (b), which specifically referenced the “September/October 2019 deployments”, an objective reader would have understood the arrangements in paragraph b(a) and b(b) to apply to both the September and October Deployments.

#### Retrospective application to the May to August Invoices?

118    As noted above, the Defendant’s Counterclaim is premised on the Additional Requirements applying retrospectively to the May to August 2019 deployments as well. An issue that falls to be addressed is whether the Additional Requirements were intended to be applied retrospectively.

119    I start by noting that in Mr. Sean Lee’s email of 6 December 2019, no reference was made to the Additional Requirements being applied retrospectively. Given the significant impact a retrospective application of the Additional Requirements would have on the Plaintiff – which would necessitate the Plaintiff revisiting or rectifying the timesheets collected for the months of May to November 2019 – one would have expected any such requirement to have been more clearly stated, if that was the intention.

120    In any event, paragraph (a) and (b) of the Supplemental Agreement, read collectively, would have given the objective impression that paragraph (a), which contained the Additional Requirements, was to apply prospectively, and hence the need to specifically address the manner of resolving the September/October deployments in paragraph (b). As mentioned above, paragraph (b) of the Supplemental Agreement would have been redundant if the Agreed Requirements in paragraph (a) were to be applied retrospectively starting from the May deployments onwards.

121    Based on an objective construction of the Supplemental Agreement, I am therefore of the view that the Additional requirements would have been objectively understood to be of prospective application only.

122    That there was no agreement that the Additional Requirements would apply retrospectively to the May to September Deployments was further evident from the following.

123    First, Mr. Alvin Ang had earlier in the context of the 13-15 November email exchanges already stated his position that he did not agree to the “new supporting documents” having retrospective effect. Thus, in his response to Ms. Chua’s proposal contained in her email of 13 November 2019 that the “June to September” payments would also be covered by the new supporting documents, Mr. Alvin Ang replied that “_As much as I would like to, I can’t agree to this with consideration of the current situation_”[^52]. The issue of the June to September invoices being similarly covered was thereafter not raised again by Ms. Chua based on the documentary records.

124    Secondly, In Ms. Low’s email of 27 November rejecting the supporting timesheets on the basis that the name of the store personnel was not indicated, Mr. Alvin Ang replied that as the agreement regarding the provision of the timesheet was “_agreed upon on 9th October, therefore there is a challenge of obtaining that for days that was before 9th October_”[^53]. Again, there was no agreement by the Plaintiff that timesheets before 9 October would fulfil the Additional Requirements.

125    Thirdly, it was not disputed that the Additional Requirements were duly complied with by the Plaintiff from December 2019 onwards and payments were made on the later invoices without any issues. This, in my view, lent some support to the contention that the mutual understanding of the parties was that the Additional Requirements were to apply prospectively, not retrospectively.

126    Lastly, Mr. Sean Lee had stated in his affidavit at paragraph 47-48 that at an internal meeting attended by Mr. Soon, Ms. Low, Mr. Cheong and him (which led to his 6 December email), it was agreed that the Agreed Requirements would apply “_moving forward_”. This point was never asked or challenged during Mr. Sean Lee’s cross-examination. The rule in _Browne and Dunn_ would therefore apply. Ms. Low’s testimony was also expressly silent on the matters discussed at the internal meeting leading up to the 6 December email. Mr. Soon and Mr. Cheong, being attendees of the meeting who would be able to shed light on whether the Additional Requirements would apply retroactively to the May to October Deployments, were also not called to refute Mr. Alvin Ang’s claim that the agreement was for the requirements to apply prospectively. The Plaintiff’s position that the parties’ common understanding was that the Additional Requirements were to be applied prospectively therefore remained unrebutted.

## Issue 4: Whether supporting documents provided by Plaintiff for May to October Deployments sufficient?

127    Having concluded that the Additional Requirements did not apply to the September/October Deployments as well as the May to August Deployments, it remained to be considered whether the supporting documents provided by the Plaintiff before the Additional Requirements were introduced via the Supplemental Agreement were in compliance with Clause 3(i) of the Contract, specifically whether they were adequate to allow the Defendant to be _reasonably satisfied_ that the work has been performed in accordance with the Contract. I am of the view that they were.

128    I agree with the Plaintiff that the evidence bore out the fact that the timesheets submitted by the Plaintiff had provided the Defendant with substantial particulars for the May to October Deployments, as follows:

> (a)     Total number of Deployments in each month;

> (b)     Total number of Deployments on each day in each month;

> (c)     The number of Deployments for each of the relevant store outlets on each day in each month;

> (d)     Name and identity number of the Deployments;

> (e)     Name and location of the relevant store outlets where the Deployments were deployed;

> (f)     Date and time of work performed by the Deployments; and

> (g)     Signature of the relevant store personnel in charge[^54].

129    Despite the extensive particulars set out above in respect of the Deployments, the Defendant contended that it would still be unable to verify to its satisfaction that work has been performed as the outlet supervisor’s name was missing from certain time sheets (_viz_, non-fulfilment of the Store IC Name Requirement). I found this contention difficult to accept, especially as the Defendant had not shown why without the name of the outlet supervisor, the Defendant would face significant difficulties in verifying whether the Deployments did indeed take place. The name of the BA, the date of the Deployment, the outlet at which the Deployment took place, and the signature of the store supervisor had all been procured. With these information, it was difficult to understand why the Defendant would not reasonably be able to verify the Deployments – _e.g._ by checking with the relevant Outlet – had it wanted to do so.

130    Furthermore, Mr. Alvin Ang had deposed in his affidavit and at trial that multiple checks were in place to ensure that all missing Deployments would surface immediately at all material times. First, if there were a missing Deployment in any outlet, the store manager of the Outlet would have contacted the Defendant within the day itself, and the Defendant would in turn have communicated the same to the Plaintiff. To date, the Defendant had not alleged that there were missing Deployments in any of the outlets[^55].

131    Additionally, “mystery checks’ were conducted by the Plaintiff to ascertain whether the BAs were on site. The Defendant themselves had a group of merchandisers on the ground that moved around the designated locations attending to the ordering and replenishment of stock. The Defendant’s merchandisers would have provided an additional layer of oversight of the deployments on the ground in the process. The BAs were also required to provide a record of the sales they have made. Finally, there were “live updates” by way of WhatsApp chat groups, including one between the Tohtonku management team and all the merchandisers in which the latter could report any issues observed, including any Deployment shortfalls[^56]. That these additional checks were in place on the ground was not seriously challenged by the Defendant at trial[^57].

132    All things considered, I was of the view that based on the supporting information and documents provided by the Plaintiff, the Defendant had not shown that it was not reasonably satisfied that the work has been performed in accordance with the terms of this agreement so as to be entitled to withhold payment on the issued invoices under Clause 3(i) of the Contract. In my opinion, the Defendant’s dogged insistence on the Store IC Name Requirement being fulfilled in all cases, when such a requirement added limited value to the verification process, smacks of unreasonableness on the part of the Defendant.

## Conclusion

133    Based on the above, I had found that the Additional Requirements were not part of the agreed contractual terms at the inception of the Contract. The Contract was only varied on or around 6 December 2019 to include the Additional Requirements, with the intention that the Additional Requirements would be applied prospectively.

134    Prior to 6 December 2019, the operative provision governing the payment of invoices was Clause 3(i). The Defendant was obliged to pay the invoices unless it was not reasonably satisfied that work had been performed in accordance with the Contract. In light of the extensive information and documents provided, even without the Store IC Name Requirement, the Defendant had sufficient information to validate the Deployments they were being invoiced for so as to be reasonably satisfied that the Deployments had in fact been carried out.

135    Given my findings above, it was unnecessary for me to consider the Plaintiff’s alternate claim based on estoppel, which had not been canvassed in detail in the closing submissions.

136    It is similarly unnecessary for me to consider the Defendant’s alternate defence based on total failure of consideration[^58], which was only briefly addressed in the closing submissions. Suffice it to say that the Defendant had never denied that the disputed Deployments were in fact carried out. The Defendant’s main contention was that the timesheets in respect of the disputed Deployments were not accompanied by the name of the outlet supervisor _period_. Even if I were to accept that the Contract were divisible, the Defendant had not adduced any evidence to show that the challenged deployments did not in fact take place, and hence there was a total failure of consideration in respect of each affected deployment slot. In any case, in light of the particulars furnished by the Plaintiff (see \[128\] above), I had concluded that there was reasonable proof that the challenged deployment slots were in fact carried out. The Defendant’s claim based on total failure of consideration therefore fails _in limine_ in view of my findings on the Defendant’s contractual defence.

## Judgement

137    For the reasons set out above, there will therefore be judgement for the Plaintiff in the sum of $150,035.40, being the unpaid amounts in respect of the September and October 2019 Deployments.

138    It also follows that the Defendant’s counterclaim should fail in its entirety.

139    My judgement is therefore as follows:

> (a)     Judgement for the Plaintiff on the Plaintiff’s claim in the sum of $150,035.40 plus interest at 5.33% p.a. from date of writ to date of judgment, and costs.

> (b)     The Defendant’s counterclaim is dismissed in full with costs to be payable to the Plaintiff.
