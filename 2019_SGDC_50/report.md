Oral Contract – Sales Commission

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 3/2019.\]

18 March 2019

### District Judge Salina Bte Ishak:

#### Background

This is the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants for unpaid sales commission for completed sales secured on the Defendants’ behalf amounting to _US$105,331.06_ or in the alternative for damages to be assessed. The Defendants had in turn filed a Counterclaim for an injunction to restrain the Plaintiff from unlawfully interfering with the Defendants’ business interests and from dealing with the Defendants’ confidential information and property, damages for breach of contract and/or for breach of equitable duties of confidence, an order for the delivery of the computer notebook, peripherals and accessories, all hard and soft copies of the Defendants’ confidential information and for the damages to be assessed. The Defendants had also filed a third party action against the Third Party and had similarly claimed for an injunction to restrain the Third Party from unlawfully interfering with the Defendants’ business interests and from dealing with the Defendants’ confidential information and property, damages for inducing breach of contract and/or breach of equitable duties of confidence and for damages to be assessed.

2       After a careful examination of the various affidavits, the documents exhibited in the affidavits as well as the testimonies of the various witnesses in the action, I allowed the Plaintiff’s claim and entered interlocutory judgment for the Plaintiff with damages to be assessed in respect of the commissions due for the completed sales. I further dismissed both the Defendants’ Counterclaim against the Plaintiff in its entirety with costs as well as the Defendants’ third party action again the Third Party in its entirety with costs. The Defendants have appealed against my decision.

#### The Parties

3       The Plaintiff is an electrical engineer by profession who undertakes business consultancy work in Singapore and overseas for various companies. He was engaged by the Defendants as a consultant from early 2007 to 27 September 2012. The Defendants is a company registered in Singapore that is involved in the manufacture and sales of water testing equipment or analyzers in both Singapore and overseas. The Third Party is a company that specializes in video analytic technology for water security, sports safety and homeland security.

#### Undisputed Facts

4       The following facts were undisputed:

a)     The Plaintiff was engaged as a consultant by the Defendants to promote and sell the Defendants’ products to overseas markets from early 2007 to 27 September 2012;

b)     There is no written agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendants specifying the terms of his engagement as a consultant for the Defendants. He was given the designation of Director, Sales & Marketing;

c)     The Plaintiff was not paid any salary, Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) contributions or allowances by the Defendants. He was paid a commission upon the successful conclusion of a sale on the Defendants’ behalf;

d)     The arrangement between the Plaintiff and the Defendants was that once the Plaintiff secured a sale, he would place the orders directly with the Defendants. The Defendants would deal with their customers directly and all payments for the orders were either by way of letters of credit (“LC”) or telegraphic transfer (“TT”) which were made out to the Defendants;

e)     After the goods had been shipped to the customers and final payment received, the Defendants would pay the difference between what the customer paid and the transfer price to the Plaintiff based on the commission computation statement. Any bank charges, LC charges, freight charges, financing costs and other incidental costs incurred by the Defendants in processing the order would be deducted from the final amount before it was paid to the Plaintiff;

f)     When the Plaintiff’s services were terminated on 27 September 2012, there were unpaid commissions that were due to him for orders where payment had been made by the Defendants’ customers as well as those where the Plaintiff had concluded but where payment had not been made;

g)     The Plaintiff was a shareholder of the Third Party from 23 March 2012 to 30 August 2012;

h)     The Plaintiff’s termination was due to the Defendants’ Managing Director, Mr Fong Kok Wei’s unhappiness over the Plaintiff’s close association with Mr Liaw Kok Eng, the Chief Executive Officer of Zweec Analytics Pte Ltd and to the Third Party;

i)     Mr Liaw Kok Eng was previously working with the Defendants but had subsequently joined the Third Party;

j)     The main product of the Third Party is the Fish Activity Monitoring System (“FAMS”) that has been licensed to the Third Party from Exploit Technologies Pte Ltd and PUB Consultants Pte Ltd since the first half of 2012. The licences were originally granted to the Defendants before they were novated to the Third Party.

## The Plaintiff’s Case

5       The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendants is for unpaid sales commission for completed sales secured on the Defendants’ behalf amounting to _US$105,331.06_ as tabulated in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim which the Defendants had failed to pay since his termination on 27 September 2012. In the alternative, the Plaintiff sought an order for damages to be assessed. It was the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendants’ witness, DW1, Ong Bee Choo Denise had admitted in her evidence in Court that a sum of S$27,635.16 was owing to the Plaintiff and acknowledged the emails from her to the Plaintiff that he would be paid. She had also admitted in evidence that the Defendants’ owed the Plaintiff his commissions for the work done and conceded that the Defendants had no right to hold the Plaintiff’s money. The reason why the Defendants had held back the payments of the commissions was because of the Plaintiff’s association with the Third Party. It was also the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendants had not tendered any evidence to refute the completion of the sales and the Plaintiff’s entitlement to these commissions.

6       In respect of the Counterclaim, the Plaintiff denied that there was any breach of confidence as the information contained in the Defendants’ computer notebook was not confidential information. The information sent by the Defendants to the Plaintiff to promote the Defendants’ products was freely available on their catalogues and their websites. It was also the Plaintiff’s case that the Defendants had not identified or provided particulars of what the alleged confidential information are. In respect of the Defendants’ computer notebook, it was the Plaintiff’s case that numerous attempts were made to return the computer notebook as shown from the exchange of emails dated 30 October 2012, 1 November 2012 and 19 November 2012 between the Plaintiff and the Defendants. The Plaintiff had subsequently exercised his lien to retain the computer notebook in exchange for the payments due to him.

7       It was the Plaintiff’s case that he had worked as an independent consultant and did not owe any fiduciary or equitable duties to the Defendants. There was no written or oral agreement between the Plaintiff and Defendants amounting to the effect of confidentiality or exclusivity. The Plaintiff was working as an independent consultant and was thus not in a position of trust or confidence to be in breach of any duties of confidentiality. It was the Plaintiff’s case that the Third Party is in a wholly different line of business from the Defendants. The Third Party did not require any information from the Plaintiff about the Defendants’ products during his engagement with the Defendants or after his termination. Further, a number of the Third Party’s employees were ex-employees of the Defendants and would have been privy to information that even the Plaintiff did not have. It was also the Plaintiff’s case that there was no conflict of interest with his role as an independent consultant with the Defendants and his role as a shareholder in the Third Party.

8       It was also the Plaintiff’s case that an injunction to restrain the Plaintiff was irrelevant and baseless as there has been no interference in the business interest of the Defendants by the Plaintiff. It was submitted that the Plaintiff had never collected payments from the Defendants’ customers directly. Hence, it was absurd as to why the Plaintiff’s account with the customers should be of any issue especially since the financial transactions were made directly between the Defendants and its customers.

## The Defendants’ Case

9       It was the Defendants’ case that the Plaintiff was not entitled to his unpaid sales commissions as he was in breach of his duties owed to the Defendants as listed in paragraph 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the Defence. Further, as the Plaintiff was in a relationship of trust and confidence with the Defendants, the Plaintiff owed the Defendants fiduciary, equitable and other duties including duties of confidence and confidentiality. According to the Defendants, the Plaintiff had breached his duties when he failed to conduct a proper handover as listed in paragraphs 4.6 to 4.12 of the Defence and when he had disclosed confidential information belonging to the Defendants to the Third Party.

10     It was the Defendants’ case that the Plaintiff had access to, received and was entrusted with the Defendants’ customer, product, price, quote, costing lists. He had been entrusted with the Defendants’ property including documents as well as a computer notebook together with its peripherals and accessories that was proprietary to the Defendants and had contained confidential information pertaining to the Defendants’ products and customers. It was also the Defendants’ case that as a shareholder of the Third Party, the Plaintiff had unlawfully procured the Defendants’ confidential information and had disclosed them to other parties including the Third Party in breach of his duties to the Defendants. According to the Defendants, the Third Party is a competitor of the Defendants in common businesses and they serve the same markets or industries. As a consequence of these breaches of the Plaintiff’s duties, the Defendants had suffered loss and damage. By reason of these breaches, the Defendants were entitled to determine the Plaintiff’s right to commission and/or any appointment.

11     Consequently, the Defendants’ Counterclaims for an injunction to restrain the Plaintiff from unlawfully interfering with the Defendants’ business interests and from dealing with the Defendants’ confidential information and property, damages for breach of contract and/or for breach of equitable duties of confidence and for the damages to be assessed. The Defendants also sought the delivery of the computer notebook together with its peripherals and accessories and all hard and soft copies of the Defendants’ confidential information.

## The Third Party

12     It was the Third Party’s case that the Defendants’ third party action against them was for a separate and distinct claim and not a claim for an indemnity or contribution in respect of the Plaintiff’s claim. This is despite the existence of similar claims being made by the Defendants against the Third Party in another suit, DC/DC1867/2017 for which the trial had been completed. The Defendants had made serious allegations against both the Plaintiff and the Third Party of unlawful interference with its business and alleged that the Third Party had conspired to induce the Plaintiff’s breach of contract and/or equitable breaches of fidelity confidence. According to the Third Party, the Defendants’ claim was nothing more than an abuse of process and many of the issues raised by the Defendants should be rightly and properly dealt with in the other suit.

13     It was the Third Party’s case that there was no conflict of interest in the Third Party’s engagement of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff was a shareholder of the Third Party for a brief period from 23 March to 30 August 2012. He was never an employee of the Third Party. During his engagement by the Defendants, the Plaintiff had sold only water analyzers using UV spectrometer technology. The Plaintiff had testified that he had never sold any products based on the FAMS technology. FAMS is one of the core products of the Third Party and it is now known as AquaTEC. The underlying technology of FAMS was originally licensed to the Defendants before the licence agreements were by express agreement novated to the Third Party. The Third Party is now the exclusive licence holder of the FAMS technology. As an independent contractor, the Plaintiff was free to be engaged by any party. He was an independent contractor of the Third Party and he assisted in the marketing of a product known as SecurTec Water Systems overseas. It was clear that the Defendants had an axe to grind with the Third Party such that it saw fit to drag the latter into a Third Party Action and raise the same issues in the present case as in DC/DC1867/2017.

14     It was the Third Party’s case that the Defendants’ third party claim against them is a rehash of its Defence and Counterclaim against the Plaintiff. The only link between the Plaintiff’s claim and the Third Party claim is the allegation that the Plaintiff had leaked confidential information to the Third Party and the Third Party in permitting the Plaintiff to be its shareholder had unlawfully interfered with the Defendants’ legitimate business interest. According to the Third Party, the Defendants and the Third Party are not in the same industry. The Defendants is primarily in the business of manufacture of water analyzers and the Third Party never sold water analyzers. The Defendant had failed to adduce any evidence that it was, at the material time selling a similar product as SecurTec Water System.

15     It was the Third Party’s case that there was no evidence adduced by the Defendants to support its claim that the Plaintiff had disclosed its confidential information to the Third Party and the Third Party had unlawfully interfered in its business. Further, there was no evidence adduced by the Defendants to show that the Third Party was in possession of any confidential information or equipment belonging to the Defendants. In addition, there was no evidence adduced as to how the Third Party interfered with its business interest or otherwise conspired with the Plaintiff.

## Issues

16     In the present case the main issues for my determination were as follows:

(a)     Whether the Plaintiff had established his claim against the Defendants for the unpaid sales commissions for completed sales secured on the Defendants’ behalf as set out in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim and if so, the amounts that were payable to him;

(b)     Whether the Plaintiff had owed duties to the Defendants as listed in paragraph 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the Defence as well as fiduciary, equitable and other duties including duties of confidence and confidentiality and whether he had breached of any of these duties;

(c)     Whether the Plaintiff had unlawfully interfered with the Defendants’ business interests and had handed over the Defendants’ confidential information to the Third Party;

(d)     Whether the Third Party had unlawfully interfered with the Defendants’ business interest and had conspired to induce the Plaintiff to disclose the Defendants’ confidential information in breach of his contract and/or equitable breaches of fidelity confidence to the Defendants.

## Assessment of Evidence

17     In the present case, I noted from the onset that it was undisputed that the Plaintiff was engaged by the Defendants to market their products to overseas markets for a substantial period of time namely, from early 2007 to 27 September 2012. It was also clear that there is no written agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendants specifying the terms of his engagement with the Defendants. He was given the designation of Director, Sales & Marketing. As the Plaintiff was not paid any salary, Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) contributions or allowances by the Defendants and was paid a commission only upon the successful conclusion of a sale on the Defendants’ behalf, it was clear that the Plaintiff was not engaged as one of the Defendants’ employees but as an independent contractor.

18     In the course of trial, the Defendants had not produced any evidence whether written or otherwise that supported its claim that the Plaintiff owed the duties as set out at paragraphs 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of the Defence or even fiduciary or equitable duties to the Defendants and that the Plaintiff had acted in breach of any or all of these duties. There was also no evidence of a written or oral agreement between the Plaintiff and Defendants amounting to the effect of confidentiality or exclusivity. It was clear that the Plaintiff was working as an independent consultant and was thus not in a position of trust or confidence to be in breach of any duties of confidentiality. In the premises, I found the Plaintiff’s account of the arrangement between himself and the Defendants more credible than the Defendants. On the facts, I found that the Plaintiff had been engaged by the Defendants as an independent contractor from early 2007 to 27 September 2012. I also found that there was no evidence before me that the Plaintiff had acted in breach of this oral agreement or arrangement between them. I further noted that there did not appear to be any issue in relation to the payment of his commissions between the parties for more than five years until his termination on 27 September 2012. The arrangement between the Plaintiff and the Defendants had only come to a head upon the Defendants’ discovery that the Plaintiff was a shareholder of the Third Party sometime in 2012. Shortly after, the Defendants unceremoniously terminated the Plaintiff’s services with the Defendants.

19     It was also undisputed that initially there was an agreement by the Defendants to pay a sum of S$27,635.16 on 12 October 2012 as the Plaintiff’s commission for AWA Sales Order 6201, 6192, 6199, 6200 and 6206 and for the return of the deposit for the Bankers Guarantee as reflected in paragraph 9 at items (i) and (ii) of the Statement of Claim upon the Plaintiff’s return from an overseas trip. The Plaintiff was to return the Defendants’ computer notebook as evidenced from the exchange of emails between them. Nevertheless, the Defendants subsequently failed to honour this agreement and the said sum of S$27,635.16 remains unpaid more than six years later to date.

20     The Plaintiff’s claim in the present suit is for US$105,331.06 which is in respect of the said sum as well as the sums listed in items (iii) to (vi) of paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim as these were orders that the Plaintiff had negotiated and finalized prior to his termination. From the evidence before me, it was undisputed that there were unpaid monies due to the Plaintiff by the Defendants but the next question to be determined was whether the Defendants were entitled to withhold payment of these monies as he was breach of his duties owed to the Defendants as alleged by the Defendants.

21     Despite the lengthy and convoluted closing submissions as well as the multitude of affidavits filed by the Defendants’ witnesses in support of the allegations that the Plaintiff had owed varies duties to the Defendants, these allegations were largely unsubstantiated and not supported by corroborative evidence. There was no evidence that the Plaintiff was contractually restrained from working for third parties nor were there any evidence that the Plaintiff had acted in conflict of the Defendants’ interest while promoting the Defendants’ products. In particular, there was no evidence that the Plaintiff had marketed and sold products of competitors to the Defendants’ customers after his termination. There was also no evidence adduced before me that the Plaintiff had any fiduciary relationship with the Defendants. In addition, there was no evidence of any agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendants as regards the confidentiality of information given to the Plaintiff when he was engaged by the Defendants to promote their products. There was no corroborative evidence before me that the Plaintiff had unlawfully procured the Defendants’ confidential information and had disclosed to the Third Party. In particular, there was no evidence before me that the Plaintiff had interfered with the Defendants’ business interests and had unlawfully handed over the Defendants’ confidential information to the Third Party. On the facts, I found that the Defendants’ assertion that the Plaintiff had handed over the Defendants’ confidential information wholly unsubstantiated and without merit. It was clear that there was no merit in the Defendants’ counterclaim for an injunction to restrain the Plaintiff from unlawfully interfering with the Defendants’ business interests and from dealing with the Defendants’ confidential information and property.

22     Having considered the evidence, I found that the Defendants did not have a legitimate basis to deny the Plaintiff of his unpaid commissions in respect of the work he had performed for the Defendants as set out in paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim. It was clear that the Plaintiff’s termination on 27 September 2012 stemmed from his association with the Third Party and not due to any breaches of contract and/or for breaches of equitable duties of confidence.

23     Based on the totality of the evidence before me, I was of the view that the Defendants were liable for the Plaintiff’s unpaid commission and that the Plaintiff’s claims succeed. Nevertheless, as the entire sum claimed includes items (iii) to (vi) of paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim that involved orders that the Plaintiff had negotiated and finalized but where payments had yet to be made at the time of his termination, accordingly interlocutory judgment is entered for the Plaintiff with damages to be assessed in respect of the commissions due for the completed sales. This was in light of the Plaintiff’s position that he would receive his commissions only after the Defendants were paid in full by their customers. On the evidence before me, the reliefs sought by the Defendants’ in their Counterclaim against the Plaintiff apart from being convoluted and unnecessarily lengthy, were without merit and unsubstantiated. Accordingly, I dismissed the Defendants’ Counterclaim in its entirety with costs.

24     In respect of the Defendants’ claim against the Third Party, I was similarly of the view that the reliefs sought by the Defendants were without merit and unsubstantiated. I accepted the Third Party’s contention that the Defendants and the Third Party are not in the same industry. There was no evidence that the Third Party and the Defendants were competitors in the same industry or that the Defendants at the material time were selling a similar product as the Third Party’s SecurTec Water System. There was no evidence adduced which showed that the Third Party had unlawfully interfered with the Defendants’ business interests and had used the Defendants’ confidential information. In particular, there was no evidence before me that the Plaintiff had unlawfully procured the Defendants’ confidential information and had disclosed to the Third Party. Further, there was no evidence adduced by the Defendants to show that the Third Party was in possession of any confidential information or equipment belonging to the Defendants and that it was used to interfere with the Defendants’ business interest. I was also not satisfied that the Defendants had proven on a balance of probabilities that the Third Party had induced the Plaintiff to commit breaches of contract and/or breaches of equitable duties of confidence. It was clear that there was no merit in the Defendants’ claim for an injunction to restrain the Third Party from unlawfully interfering with the Defendants’ business interests and from dealing with the Defendants’ confidential information and property. Accordingly, I dismissed the Defendants’ claim again the Third Party in its entirety with costs.

## Decision

25     Accordingly, I was of the view that the Plaintiff had established his case on a balance of probabilities and that interlocutory judgment is entered for the Plaintiff with damages to be assessed in respect of the commissions due for the completed sales. I further dismissed both the Defendants’ Counterclaim against the Plaintiff in its entirety with costs as well as the Defendants’ claim again the Third Party in its entirety with costs.

26     Subsequently, on 28 January 2019 after hearing written submissions on costs by all parties, I fixed costs on an indemnity basis payable by the Defendants to the Plaintiff at $26,000 excluding disbursements. The disbursements are to be taxed if not agreed. In addition, I also fixed costs on an indemnity basis payable by the Defendants to the Third Party Claim at $23,000 plus disbursements agreed at $1,692.47.
