\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9024/2019/01.\]

12 March 2019

### District Judge Kessler Soh:

1       Mr Ismawi Bin Ismail, a Singaporean currently aged 41 years, was employed as a warehouse supervisor by C. Steinweg Warehousing (F.E.) Pte Ltd (“**Steinweg**”). He was deployed to Steinweg’s warehouse at 28 Jurong Port Road (the “**Warehouse**”). Between June and December 2017, he misappropriated 129 tonnes of nickel cathode plates (worth about $2,088,000) stored at the Warehouse. He facilitated the crime by bribing a warehouse supervisor and a security officer.

2       19 charges were brought against the defendant. One charge was for criminal breach of trust, while the remaining charges were for corruption. Upon a plea offer by the prosecution he pleaded guilty to eight charges, with the remaining charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. On 21 January 2019 he was sentenced to a total of 6 years and 12 months’ imprisonment, which he commenced serving. He filed the present appeal against the sentence on 29 January 2019.

3       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

#### Facts

#### (a)   Background – initial conspiracy to sell wooden pallets

7       Sometime in mid-2017, at a canteen near the Warehouse, the defendant was approached by a person who introduced himself as “Vijay”. Vijay asked him whether he had anything to sell. He told Vijay that he could sell empty wooden pallets (of the type used to hold goods).

8       In June 2017, the defendant told Zainal (another warehouse supervisor deployed to the Warehouse) of his plan to sell empty wooden pallets from the Warehouse. He told Zainal that he would pack and arrange the pallets, and arrange for a lorry to pick up the pallets from the Warehouse after 8 pm, when the other employees of Steinweg would not be present.

9       He asked Zainal to help him by covering a CCTV camera at the Warehouse. He also asked Zainal to inform Letchumanan, a security officer deployed to the Warehouse as a night security guard, of the matter. (Letchumanan was an employee of APRO Asian Protection Pte Ltd, a security company engaged by Steinweg.) The defendant asked Zainal to speak with Letchumanan because, although both he and Zainal were warehouse supervisors, Zainal was more senior and he felt that Zainal had more authority.

(a)     Zainal was to instruct Letchumanan to allow unknown lorries to enter and exit the Warehouse premises without recording their entry and exit details on a visitor movement log sheet or checking the contents of the lorries on departure. This was necessary as the empty wooden pallets belonged to Steinweg and the defendant was not authorised to remove them from the Warehouse or to sell them.

(b)     The defendant also asked Zainal to pay Letchumanan for his help. He told Zainal that he would give him $200 for this. Zainal agreed.

10     On the defendant’s part, he would enter the Warehouse office and disarm the Warehouse alarm using the passcode that had been assigned to him. He would then block the view of the security cameras in the Warehouse by covering them with cloth. He would prepare and load the wooden pallets onto unknown lorries as arranged with Vijay.

11     Pursuant to this arrangement, empty wooden pallets were removed from the Warehouse on unknown lorries on various occasions from June 2017.

#### (b)   Subsequent misappropriation of nickel cathode plates for sale

12     Subsequently, an associate of Vijay, named “Lingam”, approached the defendant to ask whether he had anything else to sell from the Warehouse. Despite having no authority to do so, the defendant agreed to sell Lingam the nickel cathode plates stored at the Warehouse.

13     The defendant’s arrangement with Zainal and Letchumanan continued, but he did not inform them that he would be selling nickel cathode plates (instead of empty wooden pallets).

#### (c)   Payment of bribes to warehouse supervisor (Zainal)

14     On three occasions in or around September, October and November 2017, the defendant informed Zainal that lorries were to be loaded with empty wooden pallets at the Warehouse. Zainal informed Letchumanan and instructed him to allow the lorries to enter and exit the Warehouse premises without recording their entry and exit details on a visitor movement log sheet or checking the contents of the lorries on departure.

15     Zainal also returned with the defendant to the Warehouse after working hours to block the view of a CCTV camera capturing footage of vehicle and personnel movements at the Warehouse. He would do so either by using a forklift to move a container to block the CCTV camera or by using a long pole to place a cloth over the camera. Zainal would then leave the Warehouse before the lorries arrived, returning only after they had left to unblock the view of the CCTV camera.

16     Two or three days after each occasion, the defendant would meet Zainal in a toilet at the Warehouse and give him $200. This included the three occasions in September, October and November 2017.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

#### (d)   Involvement of warehouse administrator (Mohd Ali)

17     Sometime in November 2017, the defendant stopped involving Zainal in this arrangement. He dealt with Letchumanan directly. The defendant also approached a warehouse administrator deployed to another of Steinweg’s warehouses, one Mohd Ali Hanafiah Bin Mahamod (“**Mohd Ali**”). He told Mohd Ali of his plan to sell nickel cathode plates from the Warehouse. Mohd Ali agreed to participate, and subsequently aided the defendant in shifting the nickel cathode plates in the Warehouse and loading them onto unknown lorries.

#### (e)   Payment of bribes to security officer (Letchumanan)

18     Back in June 2017, after the defendant informed Zainal that a lorry would be coming to the Warehouse to pick up empty wooden pallets. Zainal relayed this to the security officer Letchumanan. Zainal instructed Letchumanan to allow the lorry to enter and exit the warehouse premises without recording its entry and exit details on a visitor movement log sheet or checking the contents of the lorry on its departure. Letchumanan complied with this instruction even though it was his responsibility as a security officer to do all of these things. Shortly after, the defendant passed $100 to Zainal and asked him to give it to Letchumanan as a reward. Zainal did so. The defendant thus abetted by instigation Zainal to corruptly give gratification of $100 to Letchumanan.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

19     Subsequently, on three occasions in or around September, October and November 2017, Letchumanan was instructed to allow unknown lorries to enter and exit the warehouse premises without recording their entry and exit details on a visitor movement log sheet or check the contents of the lorries on their departure. Letchumanan complied with these instructions. On 11 September, 2 October and 13 November 2017, the defendant deposited $800 into Letchumanan’s bank account as a reward.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

#### (f)   CBT of nickel cathode plates

20     As a warehouse supervisor, the defendant had the key to the Warehouse and could arm and disarm the alarm system of the Warehouse. He was responsible for monitoring the daily operations of the Warehouse, which included the movement of goods in and out of the Warehouse and the goods stored in it. He was therefore entrusted with the contents of the Warehouse.

21     The defendant loaded nickel cathode plates stored in the Warehouse onto a lorry driven by “Lingam” (referred to at \[12\], above) on various occasions. The dates and the quantities involved are summarised in the following table:

22     Each bundle weighed approximately 1.5 tonnes. The total weight of nickel cathode plates removed from the Warehouse was therefore approximately 129 tonnes, and worth approximately $2,088,000.

23     For the occasions between June and October 2017, the defendant physically moved and loaded the nickel cathode plates onto the lorries on his own using a forklift.

24     For the occasions in November and December 2017, the defendant was aided by Mohd Ali. Before each of the stated dates, he and Mohd Ali would go to the Warehouse after working hours to shift nickel cathode plates to an empty area near the entrance of the Warehouse in preparation for loading. On the stated dates, they would return to the Warehouse to load the nickel cathode plates onto lorries. The defendant gave Mohd Ali around $50 each time he helped to shift the nickel cathode plates in preparation for loading, and $200 each time he helped to load the lorries.

25     The defendant was not authorised to remove and sell the nickel cathode plates. He has not made any restitution to Steinweg.

#### Charges taken into consideration (TIC)

26     The remaining eleven charges taken into consideration for sentencing were similar in nature to the proceeded Corruption Charges. They related to other occasions when corrupt gratification was given to Letchumanan and Zainal. The salient details of the TIC charges were as follows:

## SENTENCE

#### Prosecution’s submissions

27     The prosecution submitted that an aggregate sentence of 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment should be imposed.

28     It was highlighted that on multiple occasions over half a year, the defendant dishonestly misappropriated valuable property worth more than $2 million that had been entrusted to him as a warehouse supervisor. He also repeatedly bribed his colleagues to facilitate the wrongful removal of property from the Warehouse.

29     The offences were sophisticated with carefully orchestrated efforts and steps to avoid detection. The defendant personally obscured the view of the CCTV cameras at the Warehouse to ensure his conduct would not be detected. He recruited another warehouse supervisor Zainal to help him with this task, and instigated Zainal to arrange for the assistance of the security officer Letchumanan. Eventually, he also co-opted a warehouse administrator Mohd Ali into this criminal scheme to assist him. These facts disclosed that the defendant acted with deliberation, premeditation and planning, which is an aggravating factor.

30     For the CBT Charge, it was submitted that a sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment or more should be imposed, considering the significant worth of the property involved. For the Corruption Charges, it was submitted that a sentence of 2 to 3 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for each charge. (The sentencing precedents referred to by the prosecution will be considered later, at \[38\]-\[40\].) As for the aggregate sentence, it was submitted that the sentence for the CBT Charge and two of the Corruption Charges should run consecutively.

#### Mitigation plea

31     In the defendant’s mitigation plea it was submitted that, in respect of the CBT Charge, a sentence of no more than 6 years’ imprisonment would suffice; and in relation to the Corruption Charges, a fine upward of $3,000 with a short custodial term in default. Counsel also urged the court to take into account the defendant’s earlier period of remand for about five months (from January to 13 June 2018) before his release on bail.

32     It was highlighted that this was the defendant’s first conviction. He had been a law-abiding citizen. He cooperated with the investigations, and much of the critical facts in the prosecution’s statement of facts were provided by him. He was remorseful for his actions and opted to plead guilty at the pre-trial stage.

33     The defendant was married with two young children, aged 11 and 9 years. He provided care to his elderly mother who was in ill-health. He had been contributing to his mother’s expenses prior to the commission of the offences. His family was facing financial hardship as he was the sole breadwinner, and would face extreme financial hardship should he be incarcerated for a prolonged period. His involvement in the offences was a desperate attempt to improve the financial situation of his family and to provide a better future for them. He did not commit the offences to support a lavish lifestyle.

#### Sentencing considerations

#### (a)   Sentencing objective

34     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, I considered _deterrence_ to be the dominant sentencing objective, both for the CBT Charge and the Corruption Charges.

#### (b)   Culpability, harm, aggravating and mitigating factors

35     In my judgment, the defendant’s culpability and the harm caused were high. The CBT offence was premeditated, carefully planned and coordinated. The property misappropriated had been stored in a locked warehouse, monitored by CCTV cameras and guarded by a security officer. The misappropriation of the property on various occasions over the course of six months (from June to December 2017) required the circumvention of these safeguards each time to evade detection. This involved obscuring the CCTV cameras and disarming the alarm systems. It also involved bribing another warehouse supervisor (Zainal) and the security officer (Letchumanan) to secure their assistance; as well as securing the participation of the warehouse administrator (Mohd Ali).

36     The harm caused to Steinweg from the loss of the nickel cathode plates worth about $2,088,000 was massive. No restitution has been made.

37     In the defendant’s favour, I accepted the submission of the defence (which was not disputed by the prosecution) that he had been cooperative during investigations. This, taken together with his plea of guilt, was evidence of remorse, which was a mitigating factor. He had no prior convictions.

#### (c)   Sentencing precedents

38     In relation to the CBT Charge, the prosecution submitted a table of sentencing precedents of cases where property of high value had been misappropriated. Brief details of some of these cases are set out in the following table:

39     The defence also made reference to some past cases. At paras 54-61 of the mitigation plea, counsel highlighted the cases of _PP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny_ , and _PP v Teo Cheng Kiat_ . I found these cases to be less helpful, however, as they were decided before the amendments to the Penal Code in 2008 – when the maximum imprisonment term for offences under s 408 of the Penal Code was enhanced from 7 years to _15 years_.

#### (d)   Appropriate sentence for CBT Charge

41     The amount of property misappropriated in the CBT Charge was very substantial. A total of 129 tonnes of nickel cathode plates worth about $2,088,000 was misappropriated from the Warehouse. The items have not been recovered and no restitution has been made. Substantial loss was thus occasioned to the defendant’s employers, who had entrusted him with the property as warehouse supervisor. The offence was clearly premeditated and required careful planning. The plates were removed over ten occasions in the course of half a year. Each time it involved circumventing the security measures put in place at the Warehouse. In order to facilitate this, the defendant recruited and bribed another warehouse supervisor (Zainal) and also the security officer (Letchumanan), so that the lorries used to transport the plates could enter and leave the Warehouse without being documented or checked. Eventually, he also co-opted a warehouse administrator Mohd Ali to assist him in his criminal scheme. In short, he was the mastermind of the entire scheme.

42     The sentencing precedents (at \[38\] above) show a broad correlation between the amount misappropriated and the length of the imprisonment term. Where the amount misappropriated is large, the courts have imposed correspondingly lengthy terms of imprisonment. For example:

(a)     In _PP v Tan Wei Shen_ (s/n 1 of the table), a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment was imposed for the CBT of watches worth $1,333,040.40 (of which almost all were recovered).

(b)     In _PP v Chan Kum Chuen_ (s/n 2), 6 years’ imprisonment was imposed for the CBT of a total sum of $804,585.13 (inclusive of the TIC charge).

(c)     In _PP v Lee Han Boon Adrian_ (s/n 3): 6 years’ imprisonment was imposed for the CBT of a total sum of $1,734,539.

43     In the present case, considering the very large amount of property misappropriated ($2,088,000), and the high culpability of the defendant, I accepted the prosecution’s submission that a sentence of at least 7 years’ imprisonment was appropriate. The defence had submitted that the defendant did not receive much financial benefit. Counsel informed the court that in the defendant’s statement it was stated that he gained $60,000. This was a bare assertion and, as was pointed out by the prosecution, the actual gain of the defendant could not be verified as there was no paper trail. In any case, the more important consideration was the massive loss caused to the defendant’s employer Steinweg by his actions, of which there has been no restitution or recovery of the misappropriated property.

44     That said, I took into account that the defendant had earlier spent time in remand for about five months (20 January – 13 June 2018). It was appropriate, in my judgment, that this period be discounted from the eventual sentence. Hence, from a starting point of 7 years, and discounting 5 months, a sentence of 6 years and 7 months’ imprisonment was imposed for the CBT Charge.

#### (e)   Appropriate sentences for Corruption Charges

45     In respect of the Corruption Charges, I accepted the submission of the prosecution that the defendant’s bribing of the warehouse supervisor Zainal and the security officer Letchumanan fell within the _second category_ of cases described by the High Court in _PP v Syed Mostofa Romel_ (“**_Romel_**”) (at \[26\] and \[28\]). In such cases, the receiving party (Zainal and Letchumanan) is paid to forbear from performing what he is duty bound to do (to ensure that the contents of the Warehouse were kept secure), thereby conferring a benefit on the paying party (the defendant). It was held by the High Court in _Romel_ that such cases “frequently attract custodial sentences”. In the present case, the defendant’s bribing of Zainal and Letchumanan to assist in his _criminal_ conduct clearly warranted a custodial sentence.

46     With reference to the sentencing precedents cited by the prosecution (at \[40\], above), in the case of _PP v Jiang Jinxiang_ (s/n 1), a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment was imposed on an untraced offender for _offering_ a bribe of $100 to a security guard not to record the names of visitors to the offender’s unit (so as to facilitate her carrying out of vice activities). In _PP v Rajeswaran Sandra_ (s/n 2), the offender was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment for paying a bribe of $2,250 to a Cisco officer to facilitate the clearance of duty unpaid cigarettes out of Jurong Port.

47     The culpability of the present defendant was, in my judgment, significantly higher than in _Jiang Jinxiang_ and somewhat similar to that of _Rajeswaran Sandra_. While the amount of the bribe in _Rajeswaran Sandra_ for the proceeded charge was higher than in the present case, there were significantly more offences of corruption in the present case committed over a period of time, with bribes ranging from $100 to $800. I accepted the submission of the prosecution that a sentence in the range of 2 to 3 months’ imprisonment for each charge would be appropriate.

48     Accordingly, for offences involving bribes of $100 or $200, I considered it appropriate to impose a sentence of 2 months’ imprisonment per charge. For the other corruption offences which involved larger bribes of $800 (which were given to the security officer Letchumanan), a longer sentence of 3 months’ imprisonment was imposed per charge.

49     Given that there were two recipients involved in the seven proceeded Corruption Charges, it was appropriate for the sentences of at least two of these offences to run consecutively, together with the sentence for the CBT Charge.
