### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

## The Charges

Liew Muhammad Zulkifli (the accused), male, aged 33, claimed trial and was convicted on 5 (enhanced) trafficking charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), Chapter 185. The offences were committed on 14 April 2017, at about 11 p.m., in the vicinity of Block (Blk) 57 Lengkok Bahru, Singapore when he gave to one Mohd Yuswi Bin Mohd Yusof (Yuswi) 4 different type of Class A controlled drugs, namely 3.99 grams of methamphetamine, 1.18 grams of MDMA, 0.15 gram of ketamine, 0.58 gram methamphetamine and nimetazepam, a Class C controlled drug. (There were 9 other charges under the MDA which were stood down pending the outcome of the trial).

2       After his conviction on the trafficking charges, the accused pleaded guilty to 3 charges with 6 charges being taken into consideration(TIC) for the purpose of sentencing with his consent.

3       The accused was sentenced to serve a total of 11 years, 12 months imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. He is now appealing against his conviction and sentence.

## The Prosecution’s Case

4       The prosecution led evidence from 14 witnesses. These witnesses comprised officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), police officers, analysts from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and 4 laypersons. The 4 laypersons included Mohd Yuswi Bin Mohd Yusof (Yuswi), PW9, to whom the accused passed the drugs to and Yuswi’s 3 children. As the trafficking charges were preferred against the accused arresting from Yuswi’s arrest, it would be appropriate to begin with his arrest.

#### SSgt Nor Yazid Bin Ab Aziz (SSgt Yazid), PW10 and Sgt Darren Ng (Sgt Darren), PW11: The Arresting Officers

5       SSgt Yazid and Sgt Darren were police officers who were on foot patrol duty on the 15 of April 2017 at Blk 5 Banda Street. They saw 3 male subjects alighting from a car and walking towards the lift lobby of the block. SSgt Yazid found them suspicious as he had been patrolling the area for 8 years and had never seen them in the vicinity. He approached them and noticed that one of them, subsequently identified as Yuswi, was carrying a black sling bag over his shoulder. He decided to check the bag. When SSgt Yazid was checking the bag, identified as P13, he noticed that there were items wrapped with plastic, he heard a shout and Yuswi punched his left cheek. After punching him Yuswi ran away. SSgt Yazid and Sgt Darren chased Yuswi and he was apprehended in front of the block.

6       After his apprehension, SSgt Yazid made a further check of the bag and found pills believed to be controlled drugs and drug taking utensils. He questioned Yuswi who said that someone asked him to bring the bag to Blk 5 Banda Street and to pass the bag to another person whom he was supposed to meet at the second floor. He arrested Yuswi and lodged the arrest report, P37, at the police station. One of the 2 other males ran away but the younger one returned and said he was worried for his father. In P37, SSgt Yazid listed the items that were found in the bag carried by Yuswi.

7       Sgt Darren’s testimony was more or less along the same line as that of Ssgt Yazid. He added that SSgt Yazid was talking to Yuswi in Malay which he did not understand. He witnessed Yuswi punching SSgt Yazid. He gave chase to Yuswi after he ran away.

#### Sgt Ng Zheng Rong Warren (Sgt Warren), PW2

8       Sgt Warren, an officer with the CNB, is the investigating officer of the case. He received the drugs that were seized during Yuswi’s arrest. There were multiple drugs and they were admitted as P7-P12. These drugs were contained within 1 brown pouch and 1 black pouch which were found within a black sling bag. These 3 items were admitted and marked collectively as P13. Sgt Warren was alerted to the case by the police who had arrested Yuswi on 15 April 2017 at Blk 5 Banda Street. Yuswi was with his 2 sons. The sling bag and its contents, including a laptop, were found in Yuswi’s possession. The 15 photographs of these exhibits were admitted as P14-P28. Yuswi said that the drugs belong to the accused. A DNA swab that was conducted on the drug exhibit linked it to the accused.

9       The drugs that were seized during Yuswi’s arrest, P7-P12, were sent to the HSA for analysis. After the analysis, the HSA issued 6 certificates by their analyst one Mr Loh Wei Xiong, Samuel, PW1. In these 6 certificates Mr Samuel Loh certified that the drugs comprised 4 Class A controlled drugs namely methamphetamine, MDMA, ketamine, methamphetamine and nimetazepam, a Class C controlled drug.

#### Mohd Yuswi Bin Mohd Yusof (Yuswi), PW9

10     Yuswi testified that in April 2017 he was staying at Blk 57 Lengkok Bahru, #xxx (Lengkok Bahru). He leased this unit, a 1 bedroom flat from the HDB either in December 2016 or January 2017. He occupied the flat together with his 2 children, a daughter, one Bella Syafira (Bella), PW12 and a son, one Furqan Danial (Danial), PW14. Yuswi has another son Abdul Hakim (Hakim), PW13, who stays with his mother (Yuswi’s former wife) in Ponggol and another daughter who stays with her grandparents in Bukit Merah.

11     The accused was known to Yuswi. Sometime in February 2017 he met the accused for the first time when he was introduced to him by Bella as her boyfriend. Bella and the accused asked for his permission for them to go out together. He gave his permission and he found the accused to be “_ok_” as he respected his elders. The accused had visited Lengkok Bahru 2 to 3 times in a month together with Bella. On these visits, the accused would stay about 3 to 4 hours before leaving with Bella. The accused had slept over about twice. He had never turned up alone without Bella.

12     On the night of the 14 of April 2017, Yuswi arranged to meet his son Danial at the Redhill bus stop. Danial had gone to watch a movie and he was scared to go home alone. This was around 11 pm. Since Yuswi’s eldest son Hakim wanted to sleep over at Lengkok Bahru Yuswi told him to meet at the same bus stop at Redhill. When all 3 met they walked to the 24-hour coffee shop located at Blk 75D Lengkok Bahru as the plan was to have dinner at the said coffee shop. Outside the coffee shop they saw the accused and Bella bickering. Yuswi asked Bella, who was screaming, what was happening. She replied that she and the accused will settle the situation themselves. He observed that Bella was scolding the accused and the latter was just keeping quiet. Danial and Hakim told Bella not to fight. She told them not to get involved.

13     At that point Danial and Hakim then went behind him, about a metre away, and Hakim was smoking. The accused then gave him a laptop bag which Yuswi identified as the sling bag shown in P14. He asked Yuswi to pass it to his friend, a male Malay. Initially Yuswi did not want to take the bag as he and his sons wanted to eat. Since he thought it was just a laptop he agreed to do so for the accused. He did not know that there were drugs inside the bag. He knew there was a laptop inside the bag as he opened it slightly and saw the laptop. The accused told him to pass the bag to his friend at the void deck of Blk 5 Banda Street. He said that the friend would be waiting for Yuswi at the lift lobby.

14     Yuswi agreed to deliver the bag for the accused because he thought since the accused and Bella were bickering they could not deliver the bag themselves. Together with Danial and Hakim Yuswi took a grab car and went to Banda Street. During the journey he was holding the bag. Upon arriving at the block where they alighted near the lift, there were police officers who asked for his identity card. He gave his identity card and those of his 2 sons. The police officers checked the bag and saw a tube. They asked him what is the item and being afraid he ran away. He recognised the tube as an item for the consumption of drugs. When he ran his 2 sons ran away too. The police managed to apprehend him and Danial. He did not know what happened to Hakim. The police opened the bag and showed him the items in the bag. He was shocked to see the drugs.

15     In cross-examination, Yuswi was questioned with regard to 3 statements, D1, D2 and D3, which he gave to the police on 3 different dates. He maintained his version that the accused had given him the bag containing the drugs to be delivered to a male Malay at Banda Street. He admitted knowing one Yuzwan bin Zakaria who stayed at Blk 5 Banda Street and described him as the son of his late friend to whom he was close. His late friend had asked him to take care of Yuzwan but he was not close to him. However, Bella was close to Yuzwan. Yuswi denied that he had made arrangements with Yuzwan to stay at his house because he was wanted by the police. He denied that he had contacted the accused earlier on the 14 April 2017 and told him not to return to Lengkok Bahru and instead to go to Blk 5 Banda Street. He denied that as he was moving out from Lengkok Bahru he had taken the accused’s belongings, including his laptop bag.

#### Bella Syafira Binte Mohd Yuswi(Bella), PW12

16     Bella, Yuswi’s daughter, identified the accused as her boyfriend. By April 2017 she had been in a relationship with him for 8 or 9 months. She knew him through Yuzwan. Her father was aware of her relationship with the accused. The accused had visited Lengkok Bahru in the past. When he did, he would talk to her father and then leave. He would usually stay about 30 to 40 minutes in the flat. When the accused leaves she would leave with him too. Bella would usually return to stay at Lengkok Bahru about once a week. The accused did not stay at Lengkok Bahru with her. Other than her father, her younger brother Danial also stays in Lengkok Bahru.

17     On the 14 of April 2017 Bella had a fight with the accused at the void deck of Blk 57, Lengkok Bahru near the coffee shop. She suspected him of two timing her. Her father and her 2 brothers Danial and Hakim then came upon them. Her father approached her and asked her what happened because she was shouting. The accused did not say anything. Her 2 brothers remained behind her father. She told them to move away and stand by the side.

18     The accused then asked her father to deliver his laptop bag, which she identified as shown in P14, to his male friend at Blk 5 Banda Street. The friend will meet her father at the void deck. The accused said he had to go home because his mother was sick. Bella added that the brown pouch, with the Louis Vuitton logo, was used to keep the drugs and that the black pouch contained the wrapping material and utensils. Both these pouches were kept in the laptop bag. She was aware of the contents of the pouches but she did not inform her father. Her father agreed to deliver the laptop bag for the accused. He told her 2 brothers Danial and Hakim to accompany him. They agreed. The 3 of them left in a taxi for Banda Street.

19     Bella had in the past, on 2 or 3 occasions, gone to Banda Street to visit Yuzwan. Yuzwan’s late father and her father were good friends. Yuzwan was not involved in the delivery of the bag to Banda Street. After her father and brothers left for Banda Street she asked the accused why he did not go himself to Banda Street and the accused replied that there were CNB officers patrolling the area. Subsequently, her elder brother Hakim called and shouted at her claiming that she was trying to trap their father. She then became aware that her father had been arrested. She switched off her phone and ran off with the accused.

20     On the 27 July 2017 Bella was arrested together with the accused at the Orchid Country Club. She described P26 as the items for packing and they were usually kept in the black pouch. P27 were items meant for drug taking. Since her arrest and the accused’s arrest Bella admitted that she had visited the accused in prison and he told her to just say that she did not know if a statement to CNB from her was required.

21     In cross-examination, Bella denied that on the night of 14 April 2017 Yuswi had told her and the accused not to return to Lengkok Bahru but to go instead to Blk 5 Banda Street which is Yuzwan’s residence and to stay there. She disputed too the allegation that in the course of moving the accused’s items, Yuswi was caught with the laptop bag.

#### Abdul Hakim Bin Mohd Yuswi(Hakim), PW13 and Furqan Danial Bin Mohd Yuswi(Danial), PW14

22     Hakim, who is Yuswi’s eldest son, was staying with his mother in April 2017 in Edgefield Plains. He would visit his father at Lengkok Bahru about twice in a month. He recognised the accused as his younger sister Bella’s boyfriend. He had met the accused who was with Bella at Lengkok Bahru once or twice.

23     On the night of the 14 April 2017 Hakim testified that he, Yuswi and his brother Danial met at the Redhill MRT. They walked towards the coffee shop as they wanted to eat. They came across Bella and the accused. The couple were quarrelling. Bella was very loud. His father asked Bella what was happening and she said nothing. Hakim took a step back and decided to smoke. He did not want to get involved with Bella and her relationship with the accused. However, he was not far from Yuswi as he was about 1 and half metre away. Yuswi was in front of the couple and Yuswi spoke to the accused. He could not hear what they were talking about. He then saw the accused passing a bag, a laptop bag to Yuswi. Hakim was able to see the accused passing the laptop bag to Yuswi.

24     When he saw the accused passing the bag to Yuswi, Hakim could not recall his father’s reaction. He did not know what was inside the bag. He did not know where Yuswi was supposed to bring the bag to and he, together with Danial, just followed Yuswi in a taxi when he asked them to accompany him. Yuswi said that it would be for a short while. Hakim was not aware of the address of the place that they were headed for. Throughout the taxi ride Yuswi was carrying the bag which the accused had passed to him.

25     When they arrived at Banda Street, at the void deck and near to the lift, they were stopped by police officers. The officers opened and checked the bag which Yuswi was carrying. They asked Yuswi what was inside the bag. Yuswi reacted by punching the police officer. Hakim ran and told Danial to run too. At that time Hakim had not reported at his camp and was wanted. After he ran away he called Bella and was angry with her because he thought that she had sabotaged Yuswi. He returned to the coffee shop at Lengkok Bahru but Bella and the accused were not at the coffee shop.

26     In cross-examination, Hakim said that when the police officers opened the bag he saw a lot of resealable plastic bags inside the pouch. He did not know that there were drugs inside the bag. He just had the feeling that something must be wrong.

27     Danial, who is a younger brother of Hakim and Bella also identified the accused as Bella’s boyfriend. He had seen the accused at his father’s flat at Lengkok Bahru about once a week. When the accused was at Lengkok Bahru he would stay about 20 to 30 minutes and then he would leave. On the night of 14 of April 2017, Danial met his father Yuswi and Hakim at the Redhill MRT. They walked to the coffee shop where they saw Bella and the accused quarrelling outside the said shop. They approached Bella who was very loud and scolding the accused using vulgarities. The accused was talking to Bella. Danial and Hakim then moved back. Yuswi spoke to the couple. Danial saw the accused passing a bag, which he described as a laptop bag, to Yuswi. Yuswi then told him and Hakim to accompany him to deliver the said bag. He was not aware of the contents of the bag.

28     Thereafter, the 3 of them took a taxi and directions were given to the taxi driver by Yuswi. They alighted from the taxi at a place that he was not familiar with and walked towards the direction of the lift. There were police officers who checked them. The police officers also checked the bag that Yuswi was carrying and found something that was white in colour. Yuswi said the item did not belong to him. Hakim ran away. Yuswi was subsequently arrested.

29     When cross-examined, Danial testified that when the accused passed the bag to Yuswi, he did not see Yuswi opening the bag. When the police officers approached him, Yuswi and Hakim, they were outside the lift at Blk 5 Banda Street.

## The Defence

30     After the prosecution closed its case, the defence made a submission of no case to answer, highlighting the discrepancies in the evidence of the key prosecution witnesses. The prosecution submitted otherwise. As I was not persuaded by the submission of the defence, I invited the accused to enter his defence to the 5 charges since I was satisfied that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against him. There was evidence adduced which satisfied each and every element of the charge. The threshold at this juncture is not high and the court is not required to determine the veracity of the witnesses. I then administered the standard allocution to the accused and he elected to give his defence. He also called Yuzwan as his witness.

#### Liew Muhammad Zulkifli, DW1

31     The accused testified that on the night of 14 April 2017 at about 10 pm he went to Lengkok Bahru, Yuswi’s flat, to put his belongings. He had been staying regularly in this flat. Yuswi and his girlfriend were present. The accused left Lengkok Bahru at about 11 pm for Redhill MRT where he met Bella. They walked back towards Lengkok Bahru. While they were walking he received a call from Yuswi who told him and Bella to proceed to Yuzwan’s flat at Blk 5 Banda Street which is on the 21st floor. He asked Yuswi for the reason and the latter said he wanted to move to Banda Street because he was scared that the police were looking for him. Yuswi told him that he will carry all his (meaning the accused) belongings to Banda street for him and there was no need for the accused to return to Lengkok Bahru. The accused told Bella what Yuswi said and thereafter they went to Boat Quay at about 11.45 pm or 12 midnight to have dinner. They did not meet anyone on their way to Boat Quay. They stayed at Boat Quay for about an hour to an hour and a half.

32     After the dinner at Boat Quay, the accused and Bella went to Blk 5 Banda Street, Yuzwan’s flat. They arrived at his flat about 2 am in the morning. The accused was familiar with Yuzwan’s flat as he had visited the flat regularly with Bella about 4 to 5 times in a month. When Yuzwan who was alone in his flat met them he asked the accused and Bella where is Yuswi. The accused replied he did not know as he was expecting Yuswi to arrive at Yuzwan’s flat before he and Bella arrived. They waited for Yuswi to arrive but he did not. Eventually the accused found out from Hakim who came to Yuzwan’s flat that Yuswi had been arrested. Hakim told them that Yuswi was arrested because he assaulted a police officer.

33     Subsequently on the 26 of July 2017 the accused was arrested at the Orchid Country Club together with Bella, Yuzwan, Yuzwan’s girlfriend and a friend, one Sim Koon Ming.

34     When cross-examined, the accused confirmed that all the drugs in the brown pouch, with the Louis Vuitton logo, belonged to him. He did not tell Yuswi specifically what items to bring to Banda Street. He agreed that his account in court did not appear in his statement D5 and it was because he did not trust the CNB officers.

#### Mohamed Yuzwan Bin Zakaria(Yuzwan): DW2

35     Yuzwan who is currently serving an imprisonment term for drug and moneylending offences testified that he was staying in a flat at Blk 5 Banda Street (Banda Street) on the 21st floor. This flat was also occupied by his girlfriend and her elder sister. He described the accused as a close friend whom he knew since 2003. They would meet each other 2 to 3 times in a week at Banda Street. He knew Yuswi since 2000 as Yuswi was a good friend of his late father.

36     When Yuzwan went to prison, Yuswi did not visit him but his daughter Bella who is the accused’s girlfriend, visited him, referring to Yuzwan, regularly. He knew Bella since she was a young girl and it was after he got to know the accused. He described his relationship with her as that of an older brother and younger sister.

37     On the 14 of April 2017 at around 10 or 11 pm Yuzwan said he received a call from Yuswi who said that he was wanted because he hit someone and asked him whether he could stay in his house at Banda Street. Yuzwan agreed. Yuswi did not mention when he would be arriving at Banda Street, how long he was going to stay and who else would be coming to stay with him at Banda Street. Yuswi had visited him at Banda Street but had never stayed overnight. Yuswi failed to turn up. From the time he received the call from Yuswi till the next morning there were no visitors to Banda Street. The next morning on 15 April 2017, at about 7 to 8 am, Hakim turned up at Banda Street and told him that Yuswi hit the police and he was arrested.

38     Yuzwan confirmed that he did not know anything about the account given by Yuswi, Bella, Danial and Hakim to the effect that the accused had passed a bag containing drugs to Yuswi for the latter to deliver them to someone at Banda Street. He was not aware of what had transpired between the accused and Yuswi on the night of the 14 of April 2017.

## The Decision

39     The accused stands charged on 5 (enhanced) trafficking charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA), Chapter 185. The offences were said to have been committed on 14 April 2017, at about 11 p.m., in the vicinity of Blk 57 Lengkok Bahru, Singapore when he gave to one Mohd Yuswi Bin Mohd Yusof (Yuswi), PW9, 4 different type of Class A controlled drugs, namely 3.99 grams of methamphetamine, 1.18 grams of MDMA, 0.15 gram of ketamine, 0.58 gram methamphetamine and nimetazepam, a Class C controlled drug.

40     I shall begin with the undisputed facts. Firstly, Yuswi was arrested in the early hours of 15 April 2017 by 2 police officers, namely SSgt Yazid, PW10, and Sgt Darren, PW11, at the void deck of Blk 5 Banda Street (Banda Street). He was with his 2 sons, Hakim, PW13, and Danial, PW14. Yuswi was found in possession of a black bag, P13, and within the said bag the drugs, which are the subject of the 5 charges were found and seized by the police officers. These drugs have been analysed and their respective certificates indicated that they were methamphetamine, MDMA, ketamine, methamphetamine and nimetazepam. The accused admits that he knows about the drugs which were in a brown pouch with a Louis Vuitton Logo and that they belonged to him[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1).

41     The prosecution’s case is that the accused did pass the bag containing the said drugs to Yuswi on 14 April, 2017, at Blk 57 Lengkok Bahru, near the coffee shop, after 11 pm with specific instructions to him to pass them to a male Malay at the void deck of Banda Street. They rely principally on the evidence from Yuswi and his 3 children, namely Bella, PW12, Hakim and Danial. The accused denied that he gave the bag containing the drugs to Yuswi.

42     The issue to be determined therefore was whether the accused did hand the said drugs found within the brown pouch which was within the black bag, P13, to Yuswi and gave instructions to him to pass the bag to an unidentified male Malay at Banda Street.

#### Did the accused pass the bag containing the drugs to Yuswi?

43     Turning to Yuswi’s evidence, in gist, it was to the effect that upon a chance meeting with Bella and the accused, on the night of 14 April 2017, when both were quarrelling, at the said coffee shop at Lengkok Bahru, the accused passed him the bag, which he described as a laptop bag[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2), with specific instructions[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) to deliver them to a male Malay at Blk 5 Banda Street. His evidence was corroborated by Bella, Hakim and Danial on all the material aspects. They were present at the same coffee shop when the accused interacted with Yuswi. They were able to observe without any obstruction what had taken place. All 3 testified to the effect that the accused did pass the bag to Yuswi. Bella specifically heard the accused’s instructions to Yuswi as she testified that “_Liew asked for my father’s help to deliver the bag to Chinatown….at Block 5 Banda Street…. to deliver a bag to his friend_”[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) While Danial and Hakim did not hear the exact instructions given by the accused to Yuswi, they were about a metre away from him, when they observed the bag being passed by the accused to Yuswi[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5). Their view was not blocked in any manner by any obstacle or barrier.

44     The evidence of these 4 witnesses with regard to the accused having passed the bag to Yuswi on the material date and time has remained largely consistent and broadly similar. While they were subjected to a thorough and intensive cross-examination they did not waver and maintained that the bag passing incident did take place. There was no attempt by them to embellish or exaggerate their evidence and I find that they were giving their testimonies to the best of their recollection.

45     I am mindful that the defence has highlighted some discrepancies between Yuswi’s testimony and his 3 statements, D1 dated 15 April 2017, D2 dated 15 June 2017 and D3 dated 8 August 2017. In particular, they stressed the fact that in D1 and D2, Yuswi said he did not open the bag and in D3 he disclosed that he opened, saw the laptop and some smoking apparatus. When he testified, Yuswi said he opened the bag a little bit and saw a laptop[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6). This discrepancy, in my assessment, is of little significance. It did not demolish Yuswi’s credibility. Whether or not Yuswi opened the bag is immaterial. In all his 3 statements he had repeatedly disclosed, consistent with his testimony, that it was the accused who passed him the bag containing the drugs to be delivered to Banda Street.

46     Another discrepancy was the place where he was to meet the person to whom he had to deliver the drugs. A 21st and 22nd floor of Blk 5 Banda Street was mentioned in D1 and D3 respectively, but in his testimony Yuswi said it was at the void deck of Blk 5 Banda Street. Again, I did not conclude too much from this discrepancy as it did not change the fact that it was the accused who passed the bag containing the drugs to Yuswi, with specific instructions to deliver it to a male Malay at Banda Street. In Yuswi’s favour was the fact that he was candid and forthright enough and did not deny the differences in his statements and his testimony, as he simply acknowledged these differences. He did not make any attempt to justify himself in any way. I assessed that Yuswi’s credibility remain unimpeached as not only were these discrepancies minor in nature but his explanation was adequate and credible. He remained a credible and truthful witness.

47     What is notable, which the defence did not mention, is the fact that Yuswi’s account of the events when he was stopped at Banda Street by the police officers, is consistent with the testimony of SSgt Yazid, a complete stranger to him, prior to the 15 of April, 2017. Both agreed that the punch by Yuswi happened during the checking of the bag. Yuswi said he saw what he described as a tube, the left corner of P27 and SSgt Yazid said he saw “_items that red in the plastic bag”.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)_ What is more crucial is what Yuswi said after he was apprehended to SSgt Yazid, and that was that he was supposed to pass the bag to someone at Banda Street[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8). His immediate reaction gelled with his testimony in court that he was directed by the accused to pass the bag to someone at Banda Street. On this issue of what to do with the bag Yuswi has remained steadfast and consistent which speaks volumes for his credibility.

48     In the case of Bella, the defence took her to task over inconsequential matters like how she met the accused and the nature of her relationship with Yuzwan. Bella did not shy away from admitting that she holds the visitor card for Yuzwan. These matters did not have any bearing on her evidence about the bag passing incident at the coffee shop at Lengkok Bahru. As to whether Yuswi had opened the bag when it was passed to him, this was highlighted to Bella who said that from her knowledge she remembered that he did not open the bag[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9). She refused to be drawn into agreeing and saying that her father had said something wrong in court, admitting that it could be the truth, as she was not paying attention. She explained that she was on the lookout for the police but that she remembered that he did not open[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10). This inconsistency in their positions with regard to the bag opening did not affect Bella’s firm stand that the bag was indeed being passed from the accused to Yuswi and it supports Yuswi’s account. Whether or not Yuswi opened the bag, as I have mentioned in the earlier paragraph is immaterial.

49     What did not escape my attention too was the fact that some parts of Bella’s evidence during the trial was self-incriminating. In the course of her testimony, she readily admitted that she had assisted the accused in drug trafficking activities by helping to pack the drugs and delivering them[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11) , emphasising that the accused “_has a lot of customers and he needs my help_”. [\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) She admitted that she was fully aware of the contents of the bag that was being passed from the accused to Yuswi, in that it contained drugs that were in the brown pouch. This is consistent with the accused ’s description that the drugs were kept in the brown pouch.

50     I find therefore that Bella’s credibility, like Yuswi’s, remained unimpeached. It bears emphasis to repeat that their evidence taken together prove conclusively that the bag passing incident had taken place. While Yuswi was the direct recipient of the bag from the accused, Bella was close and connected enough to the entire transaction to witness what was passed and what was said by the accused to Yuswi. I did not see any reason not to accord full weight to their evidence that the accused did pass the bag of drugs to Yuswi on the 14 of April 2017.

51     Where the 2 brothers Hakim and Danial were concerned, what they witnessed as to the bag passing incident were more or less similar. They did not hear what was being said by the accused to Yuswi. If as the defence claimed that the entire family were out to frame the accused and had conspired against him, it would have made it more complete and seal the deal entirely against the accused, if the 2 brothers had testified to the effect that they too heard what was being said but they did not. Both Hakim and Danial’s evidence has proven that the accused had handed the bag, P13, containing the drugs to Yuswi. This would amount to being an act of trafficking. Hakim’s account of the arrest too at Banda Street did not differ materially from that of the 2 arresting police officers.

52     On the defence allegation of the 4 witnesses fabricating evidence against the accused there was nothing concrete which they established for me to make a finding to this effect. They did not elaborate on the reasons, if any, for the prosecution witnesses to have done such a deed. Yuswi was described by the defence as the master mind[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) of the plot to frame the accused but there was no substantive evidence of his motive to do so. The defence had suggested to Yuswi that the plot was hatched while he and his 2 sons were in the taxi during their 14 minute journey on their way to Banda Street[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14). It baffled me as to why they would do so given that they would gain nothing of value or derive any benefit if they were to frame the accused. Further, while the plot to frame the accused was allegedly created in the taxi ride, this was never put to Hakim and Danial who were in the same taxi with Yuswi and who came to the witness stand subsequent to Yuswi. The failure of the defence to do so, thus depriving these 2 witnesses an opportunity to respond to such an extreme allegation led me to the conclusion that the defence had no real basis when they made the suggestion to Yuswi and it was just a weak attempt to discredit these prosecution witnesses.

53     Where Bella was concerned, she had made it clear that her loyalties were with the accused, not with her father, and that she still loves the accused. Her absolute indifference towards Yuswi, her own father, was appallingly clear as she had said that she was not concerned about him going to Banda Street to deliver drugs[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15). This was demonstrated undoubtedly when she added that _“I love Liew more than my dad. So I don’t care at all. And that’s my mistake”[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16)_ . Unlike the accused, who was keen to describe her as an ex-girlfriend, Bella still considered herself as the accused’s girlfriend.

54     I am aware that the accused made the claim that Danial had discussed his evidence with Hakim during the trial when they were both in the witness room. This was rather absurd as the accused claimed to have heard the word “_bag_” once[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) when he was in the dock in open court and agreed that he could not be sure they were discussing the case. The baseless allegation by the accused was swiftly debunked when Sgt Warren PW2, the investigating officer who was with the 2 brothers, who was recalled, testified there was no discussion between the 2 brothers about the case when they were in the witness room. Sgt Warren was in the witness room at all times with the 2 brothers and since he did not hear any such discussion, this accusation by the accused was nothing more than another desperate and pathetic attempt to discredit these witnesses. The accused did not produce any other witness to support his allegation despite him identifying certain persons who could have corroborated what he purportedly heard, namely the assistant counsel and the escorting officers. This is especially the case when he readily agreed that if it was loud enough for him to hear, it would have been loud enough for anyone to hear[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18).

#### Did the accused explain satisfactorily why the drugs were found with Yuswi?

55     I now turn to the accused’s defence. He denied that he passed the said bag containing the drugs to Yuswi. He explained that the drugs were found in Yuswi’s possession because Yuswi had contacted him on 14 April 2017 after 11 pm, telling him and Bella to go to Yuzwan’s flat at Banda Street as he wanted to move to the said flat. According to the accused, Yuswi wanted to do so as he was scared that the police were looking for him[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19). Yuswi told him not to return to Lengkok Bahru (referring to Yuswi’s flat) and that he will carry all the accused’s belongings from Lengkok Bahru to Banda Street. The accused did not tell Yuswi what items to bring to Banda Street. He went with Bella thereafter to Boat Quay for supper and eventually at 2 am, both of them went to the Banda Street flat of Yuzwan.

56     With regard to the alleged phone call by Yuswi on the 14 April 2017 to the accused to go to Banda Street, instead of Lengkok Bahru, the defence did not seem to maintain a consistent position when they cross-examined Yuswi and Bella. In the case of Yuswi, it was put to him that he had contacted the accused telling him not to return to Lengkok Bahru and telling him to go to Banda Street instead.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) However, the accused must have overlooked the question put to Yuswi, because when it came to Bella, when she was on the stand, his position changed as it was put to her that as she was about to return to Lengkok Bahru with the accused, Yuswi then called her telling her to not to go back to Lengkok Bahru but to go to Banda Street to stay at Yuzwan’s flat[\[note: 21\]](#Ftn_21). There was no explanation offered for this discrepancy.

57     The accused cannot have it both ways, it was either a call to him or a call to Bella, if there was such a call in the first place. When he gave his defence he adopted the version of Yuswi calling him and not Bella about the move to Banda Street[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22). He did not say anything and did not dispute when it was described as a conversation between himself and Yuswi. This discrepancy was material as it led, according to the accused, to him and Bella going to Banda Street and Yuswi carrying his belongings, meaning those of the accused, on the 14 of April 2017 and explained why the drugs were found with him. He did not explain the discrepancy in any acceptable manner and it led me to have serious doubts about his credibility.

58     There were also some obvious difficulties in accepting the account of the accused to explain why the drugs, belonging to him, were found in Yuswi’s possession. To believe the accused, would mean that at the relevant time when Yuswi was apprehended at Banda Street, he was in the process of moving from his residence at Lengkok Bahru to Yuzwan’s flat. This would necessarily involve Yuswi bringing his personal items to Banda Street. And yet, it was undisputed that when Yuswi was apprehended he was not found with any of his personal items. His arresting officer, SSgt Yazid, whom I consider an independent and objective witness, did not observe Yuswi with anything else other than the black sling bag. When this bag was seized from Yuswi, SSgt Yazid had listed the items found in the bag carried by Yuswi and it cannot be denied that in his report P37, there were no personal items, including clothes or toiletries of Yuswi in the list. P37 was not challenged by the defence.

59     When this was brought to the accused’s attention, he was too eager and quick to reply that since Yuswi has stayed over frequently in Yuzwan’s Banda Street flat, Yuswi had a set of his personal items[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) in Yuzwan’s flat. Unfortunately for the accused, this was materially contradicted by his own witness, Yuzwan, DW2. Yuzwan was very unequivocally clear that Yuswi has never stayed [\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)over prior to the arrest, only visited him at Banda Street at most 3[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25) times, which meant that he was not the frequent and regular visitor which the accused wanted to portray and that Yuswi did not keep any personal items in Banda Street[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26). The accused even alleged, in order to maintain his account of Yuswi being a regular presence at Yuzwan’s flat that Yuswi’s clothing, his clothing and Bella’s were kept inside a plastic bag in a corner of a cupboard[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27). However, this was also denied by Yuzwan who was very clear that there was no such special cupboard[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28), let alone a plastic bag for Yuswi to put his clothes. Yuzwan, being the resident of the Banda Street flat, in comparison to the accused would be in a better position to talk about where clothing, if any, should be kept in his flat. Going by his version, there was no special privilege for Yuswi.

60     In any event, if Yuswi was such a constant and regular presence at Banda Street having stayed over[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29) frequently as claimed by the accused at Yuzwan’s flat, he would have been recognised by SSgt Yazid, whose unchallenged evidence was to the effect that having patrolled the area for 8 years[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) he was familiar with the residents of the area. SSgt Yazid’s evidence is in direct contrast to what the accused claimed and being an objective witness, it should be preferred. In fact, what prompted SSgt Yazid to check on Yuswi and his 2 sons was his observation that they were not residents of Blk 5 Banda Street.

61     I now come to the reason which the accused claimed, in court, was purportedly given by Yuswi to him as to why they had to move from Lengkok Bahru to Banda Street and that is, that the police were looking for him. When he was apprehended on the 26 July 2017, and gave his long statement, D5, on the 28 of July 2017 the accused did not disclose this as being the reason. All he claimed was that he did not pass any drugs to Yuswi. He made no mention of a phone call from Yuswi telling him to go to Banda Street and that Yuswi would bring all the accused’s items himself to Banda Street and that explained why Yuswi was caught with the bag. Similarly, in his cautioned statement, P38, recorded on the same day, in his defence to the charge, the accused did not disclose the same. He gave the reason that he did not trust the CNB and that they would change his account. As to why they would do such a thing was beyond comprehension as the accused did not offer any credible evidence to explain his position. This was therefore a bare and totally baseless allegation which does not warrant much scrutiny.

62     And, more significantly, in his case for the defence dated the 9 of May 2018, P39, some 10 months later, where he admitted that his belongings included the laptop bag and that the drugs in the said bag that Yuswi was apprehended were his, for his personal consumption, the accused stated that in and around April 2017, the HDB were looking to evict him, Yuswi and Bella for non-payment of rent, that Yuswi called him to move out as they had been evicted, Yuswi offered to move the accused’s things out of the Lengkok Bahru flat and that his belongings were being moved to their temporary residence of Banda Street when Yuswi was apprehended [\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31). The accused conceded that he gave all these details[\[note: 32\]](#Ftn_32) in P39 to his then counsel. Some 5 months later in October 2018 the accused had a different version in court when he claimed that the reason that Yuswi gave for the move to Banda Street was because he was scared as the police were looking for him. He gave no reason for abandoning his version in P39, which he seemed to have overlooked was his case for his defence, and it was obvious that the 2 versions were markedly different. Further, his claim in P39 that the HDB had evicted Yuswi and his family was never put to Yuswi and the rest of the witnesses. Significantly too, P39 did not mention Yuzwan.

63     Since a good 10 months had passed since the 28 of July 2017, when P39 was filed, on his instructions, the accused had a more than generous amount of time to reflect over his case. And yet, the accused did not mention that Yuswi was on the run from the police and he did not disclose Yuzwan’s involvement. As the accused was unable to give an acceptable explanation for the difference, I can only conclude that what he said in court was nothing more than a convenient afterthought.

64     Collectively, I find therefore that the accused had failed to disclose the significant parts of his defence in his 2 statements, D5 and P38 and in P39. When Yuswi called the accused about the move to Banda Street, assuming that he did for the moment, the accused knew that Yuzwan was involved as he understood that the only friend they had living in Banda Street was Yuzwan[\[note: 33\]](#Ftn_33). Since he was facing serious charges of enhanced trafficking in controlled drugs, this would have been the opportune time for the accused to disclose his defence about the purported move to Banda Street to stay in Yuzwan’s flat, and mentioned Yuzwan, and yet D5 and P38, was absolutely silent about this move to Banda Street to stay with Yuzwan. The accused should have disclosed these material facts in D5 and P38. Since Yuzwan was also arrested with him on the 26 July 2017[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) it cannot be the case that he overlooked in failing to mention him.

65     All the accused did in P38, in addition to denying the charge of trafficking, was to say that Yuswi had stolen things from him and was pushing the blame to him but he did not explain further what these things were. The 28 of July, 2017 was the earliest opportunity for him to state his defence, being just 2 days after his arrest, and his failure to do so, with no convincing reason being offered makes the defence he offered at trial less credible and more likely than not, something he was fabricating. When P38 was recorded from him it was especially brought to his attention, the notice of warning when he was asked _“Do you want to say anything about the charge that was just read to you?_ **_If you keep quiet now about any fact or matter in your defence and you reveal this fact or matter in your defence only at your trial, the judge may be less likely to believe you._** _This may have a bad effect on your case in court. Therefore it may be better for you to mention such fact or matter now.”[\[note: 35\]](#Ftn_35)_ (emphasis added). This was precisely the effect of him keeping quiet about his defence and only disclosing it in the course of the trial.

66     Under these circumstances, I agree with the prosecution therefore that his failure to do so, in other words, his omission, must lead inexorably to the conclusion that what he raised at the trial was nothing more than an afterthought. As was discussed in the case of _Kwek Seow Hock v Public Prosecutor_

“**_If, however, the fact or circumstance that it withheld will exculpate the accused from an offence, a court may justifiably infer that it is an afterthought and untrue_**, _unless the court is persuaded that there are good reasons for the omission to mention that exculpatory fact or circumstances. This accords with common sense – if an accused believes he is not guilty of an offence that he might be charged with, he would be expected to disclose why he has such a belief. For self-confessed trafficker like the Appellant, consumption would be an exculpatory fact. Furthermore,_**_an exculpatory fact or circumstance has more credibility if disclosed to an investigating officer at the earliest opportunity after arrest_**.” (emphasis added)

67     With regard to the so called phone call that the accused claimed that Yuswi made to him to move to Banda Street on 14 April 2017, after 11 pm, I should add that it was rather odd for Yuswi to have made the call, considering by the accused’s testimony, he was in Yuswi’s Lengkok Bahru flat at about 10 pm and stayed till 11 pm. I would have expected Yuswi to inform the accused in his flat rather than make a call to him later, if it was really the case that Yuswi wanted to move to Banda Street. It could not have been the case that Yuswi was only wanted by the police after 11 pm.

68     What the accused said too about the being told about the purported move to Banda Street by Yuswi after 11 pm is inconsistent with his own defence witness, Yuzwan, who testified to the effect that the accused knew about the so called relocation plan to his flat when he told them when they came to his flat[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36). It was Yuzwan’s evidence that the accused and Bella came to his flat before 10 pm and then left. During this visit, he told them about the relocation plan which again did not make any sense and was illogical considering that by then, Yuzwan had yet to receive the call from Yuswi. And, further if Yuzwan claimed that the accused knew about the relocation plan from him when he told him and only then, it cast a doubt as to whether Yuswi even told the accused about the so called move. I noted too that Yuzwan’s evidence that the accused came to his flat before 10 pm is inconsistent and contradicts the accused’s account that at 10 pm he was in Lengkok Bahru. The accused could not have been at Lengkok Bahru and Banda Street at the same time.

69     When he was questioned as to the sequence, Yuzwan claimed that the accused asked him where Yuswi was even before he received the call from Yuswi making plans to come to Banda Street and that he told the accused that Yuswi wanted to come to Banda Street[\[note: 37\]](#Ftn_37). Yuzwan tried to avoid the issue by claiming that he was confused and perhaps Yuswi spoke to him earlier but he had agreed that 10.00 pm was probably the earliest possible time he knew of Yuswi’s intention to stay at Banda Street[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38). Assuming that this was the case, there was hence no reason for Yuswi to have called the accused around 11 pm to inform him about the move as he could have done it earlier, when the accused was purportedly in Lengkok Bahru. When pressed on, Yuzwan then segued to a different version by claiming he was unsure of the time. The consequence of Yuzwan’s variation and flip flopping on the timings made it even more doubtful that he indeed received such a call from Yuswi in the first place.

70     In the case of the accused it bears emphasising that he claimed that after receiving the call from Yuswi about moving to Banda Street, he and Bella went to Boat Quay for dinner and they went to Yuzwan’s flat at about 2 am in the morning. They stayed overnight till the next morning and met Hakim. This was an attempt to buttress his position that Yuswi had made the arrangement for them to move to Banda Street on the 14 April, 2017. This was again clearly contradicted by Yuzwan who testified that after the accused left his flat after his earlier visit possibly around 10 pm, he did not return at all and that between 10 pm till 7 am when Hakim came to his flat no one else turned up at his flat[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39). Yuzwan maintained rather firmly that he was alone when Hakim came[\[note: 40\]](#Ftn_40) and told him of Yuswi’s arrest. The accused and Bella were definitely not with him. However, when the accused was asked specifically in his examination in chief “_When Mr Hakim told you about Yuswi’s arrest, who else was there to hear the conversation between the 2 of you ?”_ he had replied “ _Bella Syafira was there and Mr Yuzwan was also there_.” _[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41)_

71     The accused even gave a rather detailed account of his observation of Hakim when going by his own defence witness he was not even in the said flat. This therefore must be a case of either the accused lying or Yuzwan lying or both lying. I took into account too that it was never put to Bella that she and the accused went to Boat Quay before both arrived at 2 am in the morning in Yuzwan’s flat and despite this failure on the part of the defence to do so, the accused irrationally claimed that Bella had lied[\[note: 42\]](#Ftn_42) when she did not mention about the supper at Boat Quay. He chose to ignore the fact that she could not have possibly lied when she was not even questioned by the defence on this matter particularly that both had gone to Yuzwan’s flat at 2 am in the morning. The accused’s failure to do so struck me that what he was raising at the defence stage was again another afterthought on his part.

72     Now, Yuzwan had insisted that Hakim had turned up at his Banda Street flat in the morning around 7 or 8 am and told him that Yuswi had been arrested. This was denied by Hakim. His position is that he called Bella because he was angry with her and suspected that she and the accused had sabotaged Yuswi[\[note: 43\]](#Ftn_43). Hakim returned to the coffee shop to look for Bella and the accused but both were not there. What Hakim said about calling Bella is consistent with her evidence that he had confronted her with a phone call[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) after Yuswi was apprehended and was shouting and scolding her. I am inclined to believe Hakim’s evidence that he did not go to Banda Street and instead went back to the coffee shop to look for Bella and the accused. It was not disputed that Hakim was with Yuswi at Banda Street when the police officers confronted Yuswi and he fled from the scene successfully, unlike his younger brother Danial. It did not make sense therefore for him to return to the venue where his father had been apprehended and to expose himself to being apprehended by the police officers. There was also absolutely no reason for him to tell Yuzwan about his father’s arrest. He was rightfully concerned in looking for Bella and the accused as he had rightfully surmised that the bag carried by his father which had been passed by him to by the accused caused his father to be arrested by the police officers.

73     Pausing now, and reviewing Yuzwan’s evidence as a whole I do not find it particularly useful in determining whether or not the laptop bag, P13, was indeed given to Yuswi by the accused on the 14 of April, 2017. On this laptop bag, which can also be viewed in P14, the accused has denied that the bag belonged to him[\[note: 45\]](#Ftn_45). However, this was not put to Yuswi when he was cross-examined by the defence as the defence seems to have conceded that it belonged to the accused as the question posed was “ _as a result of you moving out from 57 Lengkok Bahru , you also took_ **_Liew’s belongings which included the laptop bag_**_”[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46)_(emphasis added). This must be the case considering that in the case for the defence in P39 [\[note: 47\]](#Ftn_47)it was also admitted that the laptop bag belonged to the accused.

74     From the accused’s point of view, he was relying on a so called call from Yuswi to Yuzwan telling him that he wanted to stay over at Banda Street as he was on the run. I am doubtful that Yuswi even made such a call in the first place, especially when there was no evidence that he was on the run, that he had other options to go to , like his parents’ home, rather than the Banda Street flat of Yuzwan which he had never stayed over in the past as disclosed by Yuzwan, the absence of any personal items in Yuswi’s possession at the time of his arrest and the fact that even his 2 sons, Hakim and Danial, who were with him, if they were indeed supposed to stay over together with him too, did not have any personal items with them. From the evidence of both SSgt Yazid and Sgt Darren, it would appear that only Yuswi was carrying a bag and both his sons were not observed carrying anything which may have contained their personal items. Even Yuzwan conceded that it was unlikely that Yuswi would have wanted to go to Banda Street if he was running from the police, without Yuzwan asking questions about it[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48).

75     While the accused appeared confident that Yuzwan would be able to give details concerning Yuswi’s stay at Banda street pertaining to how long[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) he would be staying, Yuzwan was rather clueless when he gave evidence as he was totally unclear as to the specific details of Yuswi’s stay. As for Yuzwan’s evidence that Hakim came over to tell him about Yuswi’s arrest, which I find it very hard to believe that Hakim would do so, and as stated earlier, it would be extremely more probable that he would stay very far away from Banda Street, even if he did turn up at Yuzwan’s flat, it does not really significantly advance the defence mounted by the accused in any manner.

76     On the whole, the inconsistencies as elaborated in the preceding paragraphs and the discrepancies which cannot be reconciled, between the accused’s evidence and that of Yuzwan’s, in particular, to reiterate, his account of the accused and Bella coming to his place around 9 pm but the accused said he came at 2am and for which no convincing explanation has been offered by the accused, has resulted in demolishing the credibility of the accused. I agree with the prosecution that no plausible explanation too has been offered by Yuzwan for these irreconcilable differences. I gave therefore minimal weight to the evidence of the accused and Yuzwan. Given my finding, I had no hesitation in rejecting the accused’s defence as to how the drugs, belonging to him, ended in a bag carried by Yuswi, at Banda Street.

77     I should add that much had been made of the fact by the defence that Yuswi and his family tried to downplay their so called close relationship with Yuzwan and that Yuzwan was a material witness for the defence. This relationship among the 3 of them was apparently reflected in the exchange of letters/cards to Yuzwan who was in prison. I find that the fact whether they were close or not to Yuzwan is immaterial. Yuswi and Bella have never denied that they were not close to Yuzwan and Yuswi concedes that he treats Yuzwan as a son. The depth or lack of their relationship does not defeat the prosecution’s case and neither does it advance the defence of the accused. Yuzwan was not present at the vicinity of the coffee shop in Lengkok Bahru when the bag passing incident took place. He has in fact agreed that it may well be the case that Yuswi and his children were telling the truth[\[note: 50\]](#Ftn_50) when they gave evidence about the said incident. In Bella’s own words “_What does Yuzwan have to do with this case at all?”[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51)_

## Conclusion

78     In this case, for the offence of trafficking to be made out under section 5 of the MDA, there must be proven any act of trafficking as listed under section 2 of the MDA. The acts as listed are rather wide and “_traffic_” means  —

(a)     to sell, give, administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute; or

(b)     to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (_a_),

79     Coming back to the evidence of the main prosecution witnesses, namely Yuswi, Bella, Danial and Hakim, their combined testimony, it bears emphasis, have remained intact that it was the accused who gave the bag, P13, containing the drugs to Yuswi. The act of trafficking has been established as outlined under section 2 of the MDA as stated in the preceding paragraph. I agree with the prosecution that the core thread of their evidence was consistent, credible and detailed and proved that the trafficking act had taken place. I am satisfied that their evidence proves that the offence of trafficking has been made out beyond a reasonable doubt. I therefore found the accused guilty and convicted him on all 5 charges.

80     There were 9 other pending charges under the MDA arising from his arrest on the 27 July 2017. The accused pleaded guilty to three charges, consisting of 1 count of consumption and possession of methamphetamine and 1 count of failure to report for urine tests. He admitted to the remaining 6 charges and consented to them being taken into consideration(TIC) for the purpose of sentencing.

## Statement of Facts (SOF)

81     The material portions of the SOF (for the 3 charges he pleaded guilty to) which the accused admitted to without any qualification is reproduced below.

82     On 27 July 2017, at about 1:25 a.m., at 1 Orchid Club Road, Orchid Country Club room 307, Singapore the accused was arrested by Police officers from Ang Mo Kio Division for drug offences. A search was conducted and 4 packets, believed to be controlled drugs were seized. The accused, with the seized exhibits, were brought to the police station for further investigation.

## FACTS PERTAINING TO CHARGE (DAC-933562-2017) – CONSUMPTION OF METHAMPHETAMINE

83     At the police station, the accused provided two bottles of his urine sample. The said urine samples were sent to the HSA for analysis. The HSA subsequently issued two certificates, dated 31 July 2017, under s 16 of the MDA by 2 different analysts, namely Ms Chan Si Jia and Maggie Tiong Su Su. Both certificates stated that on analysis, the urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine.

84     Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the MDA. The accused had relapsed back to smoking ‘ice’ (street name for methamphetamine) around 6 to 8 weeks after he was released from Prison on 1 June 2016. He had abused ‘ice’ by using an improvised glass utensil. He last smoked ‘ice’ on 24July 2017 prior to his arrest. The urine samples of the accused were therefore found to contain methamphetamine as a result of him consuming ‘ice’ knowingly.

## FACTS PERTAINING TO CHARGE (DAC-933563-2017) – POSSESSION OF NOT LESS THAN 4.25 GRAMS OF METHAMPHETAMINE

85     The exhibits seized when the accused was arrested were sent to the HSA for analysis. On 31 August 2017, Dr. Sim Sui Boon Derek, an analyst with HSA, issued one certificate under s 16 of the MDA stating that one exhibit containing not less than 6.19 grams of crystalline substance was analysed and found to contain not less than 4.20 grams of methamphetamine. On 5 September 2017, Yeo Yuan Yuan Cheryl, another analyst with HSA, issued another certificate under the same section stating that another exhibit weighing not less than 1.08 grams was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.05 grams of methamphetamine

86     The total amount of methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug under the MDA, was accordingly not less than 4.25 grams. The accused admits to ownership and possession of the methamphetamine. He knew that the exhibits contained methamphetamine, bought from his supplier, ‘Tikus’, for his own consumption.

## FACTS PERTAINING TO CHARGE (DAC-933561-2017) – FAILING TO REPORT FOR URINE TEST ON 21.07.2017

87     The accused was placed under compulsory supervision with effect from 2 June 2016 for a period of 24 months by virtue of Regulation 15 of the MDA (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Regulations”).

88     Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(_f_) of the aforesaid Regulations, he is required to present himself to the Duty Officer at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters, on every Friday of each month, commencing on 25 June 2016 for urine tests from 2 June 2016 to 1 June 2018. The accused had failed to report for his urine test on 29 occasions. He contravened the said Regulation when he failed to present himself for urine test on 21 July 2017 (Friday), without any reasonable excuse.

## Antecedents

## The Sentence

90     The accused has now been convicted of 5 counts of trafficking in controlled drugs, 1 count of consuming methamphetamine, 1 count of possessing methamphetamine and 1 count of failure to report for urine tests. As the accused is a repeat offender for the trafficking offences, he faces mandatory minimum sentences of 10 years imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane for each of the Class A controlled drug charge and 4 years imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane for the Class C controlled drug charge. For completeness, the maximum sentence would be 30 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for the Class A controlled drug charges and 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane for the Class C controlled drug offence. With regard to the consumption and possession charges of methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug, the prescribed punishment for a first offender like the accused would be imprisonment up to 10 years or a fine up to $20,000 or both. For the failure to report for urine tests offence, the punishment would be a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment up to 4 years or both.

91     The prosecution, in their address on sentence, highlighted the mandatory minimum sentences for the trafficking offences but did not submit for a particular sentence. In respect of the consumption and possession charges they referred to the sentencing benchmark of 6 to 18 months imprisonment for such offences and submitted for a sentence on the higher end of the range. For the failure to report for urine test charge, they submitted for a sentence of 4 to 6 months imprisonment. Globally they sought for 3 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively, namely one of the trafficking charges for the Class A controlled drug, either the consumption or possession charges and the failure to report for urine test as these charges involve the invasion of separate legal interests, committed on different dates and involve different drugs. Their submissions on sentence was rather measured.

92     In his brief oral mitigation, counsel for the accused made no submission on the trafficking charges. For the consumption and possession charges and the failure to report for urine tests, it would appear that the defence and the prosecution were on the same page. The defence sought a sentence of 6 months imprisonment, being the lowest end of the range, for the consumption/possession offences and 4 months imprisonment for the failure to report for the urine test charge. They agreed with the prosecution that 3 terms of imprisonment should run consecutively. There were no other mitigating factors which they raised for the court’s attention.

93     There has been enough said and written on the destructive effects of drug activities in whatever form, whether trafficking, consumption or possession, and this has been universally acknowledged. The prevailing interest is the protection of society from the menace posed and the social evils associated with drug abuse. The law therefore takes a stern view of drug activities and this is reflected in the prescribed sentences in the MDA. The objectives of the Act are to eliminate the possession, consumption, importation and trafficking of illegal drugs. I am aware of the fact that the main sentencing considerations, particularly for drug trafficking offences, like the current case, where the accused is a repeat offender should clearly be that of general and specific deterrence. Having regard to the objectives of the Act, and the predominant sentencing considerations I turned to the facts of the instant case.

94     The most serious offences here obviously would be the trafficking offences. The only issue here is whether the court should go beyond the mandatory minimum of 10 years’ imprisonment for the Class A controlled drug and 4 years imprisonment for the Class C controlled drug, bearing in mind the accused is a repeat offender. In this case, I was not inclined to do so for a number of reasons. Firstly, from his antecedent history, the accused was released from prison on 2 June 2016. The trafficking offences were committed on 14 April 2017 which is well within a year of his release. This was after he served a sentence of 5 years, 8 months imprisonment and was subjected to 10 strokes of the cane, which clearly did not have the desired and deterrent effect on the accused as he remained crime free for a relatively short period. Secondly, while it was the accused’s prerogative to claim trial for which he is not to be penalised, he is certainly not entitled to any sentencing discount usually afforded to persons who chose to plead guilty at the first available opportunity. Further, while all the trafficking offences were committed on the same day I could not ignore the fact that there are actually multiple offences of trafficking which involved 5 different type of drugs.

95     All considered, for the trafficking offences, I sentenced the accused to serve 10 years and 6 months imprisonment for each of the Class A controlled drug charges and 4 years and 6 months imprisonment for the Class C controlled drug charge. This is only an uplift of 6 months per charge above the mandatory minimum term, which can hardly be described as manifestly excessive or harsh, especially since I did not intend to make 2 of the trafficking terms of imprisonment to run consecutively.

96     I now turn to the 2 charges for consumption and possession of methamphetamine, which, it must be reinforced is a Class A controlled drug. In the guideline judgment in the case of _Dinesh Singh Bhatia v PP_ it was held that it must now be clearly and unfailingly understood that all drug offences involving the possession or consumption of Class A controlled drug inexorably attract custodial sentences, save in purely exceptional cases. There were none in this case.

97     The accused, while technically a first offender for the consumption and possession of controlled drug charges, was not exactly an amateur in drugs considering his convictions for drug trafficking offences in 2013 and his DRC admissions in 2012. The range of sentences for imprisonment with regard to possession and consumption of Class A controlled drugs starts at six months (for a young 18 year old offender) and extends right up to 18 months for a first offender. The accused certainly fits at the higher end of the range as he is a mature 33-year-old offender who has committed multiple drug offences and he is more than a casual user. There was hence certainly no merit in the defence submission for a sentence of 6 months imprisonment. Further, the accused has admitted that he has been consuming drugs about 6 to 8 weeks after his release from prison in June 2016. For the consumption offence, I imposed a sentence of 1 year imprisonment which would be about the middle of the established range.

98     Where the possession charges were concerned, taking into account that there were 4 other charges of possession which were TIC involving 4 other different drugs, the accused should certainly face a sentence nearer the higher end of the range. It is indeed trite law that the approach that the courts should adopt if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased. For the possession offence therefore, the sentence imposed was 15 months imprisonment.

99     In respect of his failure to report for urine tests, based on his record, the accused has agreed that he had missed 29 tests and it was therefore undisputed that this was not the first time he had committed such an offence. While he had pleaded guilty to 1 charge, there were 2 other similar charges which had been TIC with his consent. The accused did not offer any reason why he had not complied with the order to submit himself for urine tests. I am aware that the defence had sought a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment but taking into account the relevant circumstances including the TIC charges, I was of the view that a 6 month term would be more appropriate.

100    The next issue to be considered would be the terms of imprisonment which should be ordered to run consecutively. While I am mindful that at the very minimum, only 2 terms of imprisonment needed to be ordered to run consecutively as long as it includes the longest term, in view of the number of offences which the accused had committed, I agree with the prosecution that making 3 terms of imprisonment run consecutively would be in order. The defence too did not dispute that 3 terms of imprisonment should run consecutively. This would be acknowledging the fact that the charges the accused had been convicted of involved distinct and legally protected interests. Further, in total, the 14 offences under the MDA which the accused faced were committed on 2 different dates and the trafficking, possession and consumption charges involved different drugs.

101    Considering all the relevant circumstances, I ordered the imprisonment terms for the first trafficking charge of a Class A controlled drug, the consumption charge and the failure to report for urine test to run consecutively, yielding a global sentence of 11 years and 12 months imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. This also translates to 12 years imprisonment. This can hardly be described as crushing or manifestly excessive, given that the longest individual sentence for each of the 4 Class A controlled drug trafficking charges is a mandatory minimum term of 10 years imprisonment.

## Summary

102    In totality, the sentences passed on the accused are as follows:
