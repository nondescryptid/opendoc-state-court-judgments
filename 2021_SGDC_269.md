### District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam:

1       This is an appeal against sentence filed by the four Accused persons involved in this case. They are **Muhamad Naqiuddin Khan Bin Jhangir Khan “Naqiuddin”, Muhammad Syafii Bin Majid “Syafii”, Muhammed Ra'iba Bin Mohd Fuad “Ra'iba”, and Muhammad Nafis Bin Abu Bakar “Nafis”**. All four Accused persons were originally charged with rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). Their cases were fixed for a joint trial.

2       On the first day of the trial, the Prosecution proceeded on a reduced charge for causing hurt in furtherance of a common intention under **section 323 read with section 34 of the PC** against three of the Accused persons. The rioting charge against Nafis was withdrawn and no other charge was preferred in lieu. The three Accused persons pleaded guilty to the reduced charge.

3       The four Accused persons faced an additional charge each for being a member of an unlawful society under **section 14(3) of the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed) (“SA”)**. They pleaded guilty to the charge.

4       The four Accused persons also faced a charge each for being a member of an unlawful assembly under **section 143 of the PC**. This charge was taken into consideration (“TIC”) for purposes of sentencing.

5       The Accused, **Syafii**, faced a fourth charge under **section 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, Rev Ed 2015) (“POHA”)**. He pleaded guilty to this charge as well.

6       The three Accused persons were each sentenced to 4 weeks imprisonment for the offence under section 323 read with section 34, PC. Naqiuddin and Nafis were sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment for the offence under section 14(3), SA. Ra'iba and Syafii were sentenced to 8 weeks imprisonment for the offence under section 14(3), SA. Syafii was sentenced to 2 weeks imprisonment for the offence under section 6(3), POHA. The terms of imprisonment were ordered to run consecutively. In total, Naqiuddin was sentenced to 10 weeks imprisonment, Syafii was sentenced to 14 weeks imprisonment, Ra'iba was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment, and Nafis was sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment.

7       The Table below summarises the charges against each Accused person and the sentences imposed.

## Background

### The charges

8       The Accused persons faced similar charges. I reproduce below the charges preferred against Naqiuddin for ease of reference.

> …you, on 21 April 2019, at about 4.30am, at the Basement 1 Carpark located at Marina Square, 6 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039594, together with Muhammad Nurafiyan Bin Mohamed Sani, Muhammad Syafii Bin Majid and Muhammed Ra’iba Mohd Fuad, in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did voluntarily cause hurt to two male subjects, namely, Muhammad Firdaus Bin Abdul Latif and Muhammad Zafran Bin Mohd Waffa, to wit, by punching and kicking both of them, intending thereby to cause them hurt, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> …you, between June 2015 and 24 th April 2019, in Singapore, were a member of an unlawful society, to wit, the ‘OMEGA’ Secret Society of the ‘Independent’ Group, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 14(3) of the Societies Act, Chapter 311 (2014 Rev Ed).

10     The additional charge under section 143, PC, which was taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing is similar for all four Accused persons. I reproduce below the charge preferred against Naqiuddin for ease of reference:

> …you, on 21 April 2019, at about 4.40am, at the level one carpark located at Marina Square, 6 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039594, together with Muhammad Nafis Bin Abu Bakar, Muhammad Nurafiyan Bin Mohamed Sani, Muhammad Syafii Bin Majid and Muhammed Ra’iba Mohd Fuad, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to commit the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to six male subjects, namely T Haradevan, Ng Jun Wei Sebastian, Mukesh S/O M Subramaniam, Wong Wen Jie, and two unknown male subjects, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 143 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

### Joint Statement of Facts for charge under s 323 r/w s 34 PC

11     The Accused persons admitted to the Joint Statement of Facts for the charge under section 323 read with section 34, PC. The salient portions of the Joint Statement of Facts are reproduced in the following paragraphs.

> **Events**

> On 21 April 2019, at about 4.45am, a male caller called ‘999’ and reported that there were two big groups of Malay guys shouting outside the toilet in Marina Square. The incident location was given as Marina Square located at 6 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore.

> On 20 April 2019, the accused and co-accused persons first had alcohol drinks at Cherry Discotheque at 133 Cecil Street. Thereafter, from about 3.30 am on 21 April 2019, they proceeded to Club Fleek at #01-05 Marina Square where they had more alcoholic drinks.

> Separately, on 21 April 2019 the witnesses and the victims also met at Club Fleek for alcoholic drinks. At about 4.17 am that day, at Basement 1 of Marina Square near the escalators and the male toilet (the “incident location”), two individuals attacked Zafran. At about 4.32 am that day, the witnesses and Firdaus spoke to Zafran at the incident location. Firdaus shouted at the witnesses and Zafran to ask who had attacked Zafran.

> Also at 4.32 am, the accused and co-accused persons descended the escalator to the incident location. They had not met the victims and witnesses prior to this time. They saw Firdaus shouting and Nurafiyan made remarks to the effect of, “if they cannot drink, don’t drink.” Firdaus continued shouting and Azri and Haziq brought him out of Marina Square into the Basement 1 car park to calm him down.

> As Firdaus was brought out of Marina Square, the accused and co-accused proceeded towards the male toilet. At the same time, Zafran walked towards the male toilet. Also at this time, an unknown male person fell to the floor outside the male toilet. Firdaus saw this person on the floor and thought it was Zafran. He ran back into Marina Square and shouted at the accused and co-accused to ask, “why you hit my friend.” Syahidah held and pulled Firdaus’ right arm to prevent him from approaching the accused and co-accused. Figure 1 Syahidah (in checkered pants) prevents Firdaus (in dark clothing) from approaching the accused and co-accused

> On entering the mall, Firdaus realised that the person on the floor was not Zafran. While held back by Syahidah, he smiled at the accused and co-accused and shouted, “you all ok or not.” In response, the accused persons and Nurafiyan formed the common intention to cause hurt to Firdaus and charged towards him. A bouncer working at Club Fleek at this time, Syed Siraaj Alsagoff (“Siraaj”), tried to stop the accused persons and Nurafiyan from charging at Firdaus. They however pushed past Siraaj to approach Firdaus. Figure 2 Siraaj (circled in yellow) tries to stop the accused (circled in red, from left to right Ra’iba, Syafii, Naqiuddin and Nurafiyan) from charging at Firdaus.

> Nurafiyan struck the first blow by hitting Firdaus on the face. The accused persons and Nurafiyan then chased Firdaus into the Basement 1 car park where they kicked and punched him. Seri eventually hugged Firdaus from behind and the two toppled to the floor, where Seri shielded Firdaus with her body. Seri was not hit in the process.

> As the accused persons and Nurafiyan were attacking Firdaus, Zafran emerged from the male toilet and saw the attack in progress. He rushed into the Basement 1 car park and tried to defend Firdaus. In response, the accused persons and Nurafiyan formed the common intention to cause hurt to Zafran and proceeded to punch and kick him as well.

> The attack on Firdaus and Zafran lasted for about one minute. The attack ended when Siraaj ran back up to Club Fleek to seek help from other bouncers, who together came back down to Basement 1 to stop the attack. Part of the attack was captured on CCTV.

> **Injuries sustained**

> The accused persons and Nurafiyan caused bodily pain to Firdaus and Zafran. Zafran was seen in the Emergency Department of Tan Tok Seng Hospital on 23 April 2019 where he was found to have sustained the following injuries because of the attack: a. Swelling over the right maxillary area with abrasion measuring 1cm; b. Mild bruising over the left maxillary region; and c. Superficial abrasion and scratch over the right side of the neck. Zafran was issued hospitalisation leave from 23 April 2019 to 27 April 2019.

> Firdaus did not seek medical attention.

> **Arrests**

> The police eventually arrested the accused and co-accused persons: a. Nurafiyan was arrested on 23 April 2019 at 9.45pm at #XXX of 17 Ghim Moh Road. b. Syafii, Nafis and Naqiuddin were arrested on 24 April 2019 at 12.30pm at the Police Cantonment Complex. c. Ra’iba was arrested on 24 April 2019 at 4.40pm at Parkway East Hospital. They were all then released on bail.

> **Conclusion**

> The accused persons had punched and kicked the victims in furtherance of the common intention of the accused persons and Nurafiyan to cause hurt to the victims. They have therefore each committed an offence punishable under s 323 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

### Statement of Facts for charge under section 14(3), SA

12     All four Accused persons admitted to the facts set out in their respective Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification. In essence, the SOFs stated that they were members of the ‘OMEGA’ Secret Society of the ‘Independent’ Group initially operating at Block 1 Geylang Serai, and later at Orchard Cineleisure. The SOF set out each Accused person’s rank in the secret society and the duration of his membership. The details are as follows:

> a)     Naqiuddin – member from June 2015 until 24 April 2019 and held the rank of ‘Fighter’.

> b)     Syafii – member from 25 March 2014 to 25 April 2019. He held the rank of ‘Fighter’ from 25 March 2014 to sometime in June 2016, and later was a ‘Senior Member’ from June 2016 to 25 April 2019.

> c)     Ra'iba – member from December 2017 to 24 April 2019, holding the rank of ‘Senior Member’.

> d)     Nafis – member from 2016 to 26 April 2019. He held the rank of ‘Fighter’ from 2016 to February 2019, and later was a ‘Senior Member’ from February 2019 to 26 April 2019

### Statement of Facts for charge under the section 6(3), POHA

13     On 14 March 2020 at about 8.30 pm, Syafii and one Santha Kumar alighted at the drop-off point at the Accident & Emergency Department, Alexandra Hospital. They were spotted by the security officer, Diavendran, who observed that Santha Kumar was walking unsteadily. Diavendran went to get a wheelchair for Santha Kumar. When he returned, he saw Syafii mixing cola with rice wine. Diavendran told Syafii to leave the alcohol outside if he and Santha Kumar wished to see the doctor. Syafii became upset when he heard this, and confronted Diavendran. Senior Staff Nurse Sanjeev Naidu Govindasamy (“SSN Sanjeev”) saw the confrontation and intervened. Syafii was unhappy at his interference and hurled abusive words at him saying, “a dog had sex with your mother” and “I had sex with your mother”. He also tried to punch SSN Sanjeev but failed to make contact. The police were alerted.

###    Antecedents

14     Naqiuddin and Nafis were untraced for past criminal offences.

15     Ra’iba had one relevant antecedent amongst others:

![]([2021] SGDC 0269_Image/[2021] SGDC 0269_image1.png)

16     Syafii had three relevant antecedents:

> ■    In 2008 – for being armed with a dangerous or offensive instrument under section 22(1)(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act, (Cap 184, Rev Ed 1997) (“MOA”). He was sentenced to 1 month imprisonment.

> ■    In 2011 and 2012 – he was placed on Drug Supervision at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre for 12 months and 24 months respectively.

> ■    In 2014 – he was convicted for Affray under section 267B of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”). He was fined $2,500.

> ■    In 2016 – he was convicted for harassing a borrower under section 28(1)(b) of the Moneylenders Act, (Cap 188, Rev Ed 2010) (“MLA”). He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

## Prosecution’s address on sentence

17     The Prosecution’s oral submissions on sentence was supported by two Tables of Sentencing Precedents. One for the offence under section 323 read with section 34, PC, and the other for the offence under section 14(3), SA. The submissions highlighted the aggravated circumstances of this case and the need for custodial sentences.

### Section 323 read with section 34, PC

18     Specifically, the Prosecution submitted that the charge under section 323 read with section 34, PC, merited a sentence of 1 month imprisonment for all three Accused persons. The Prosecution cited the leading case of _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor[^1]_ and argued that while the present case may be defined as a Band 1 case, as the injuries caused to the victims were not particularly serious, the victim Muhammad Zafran Bin Mohd Waffa (“Zafran”) was issued with five days of medical leave, which brings this case to the middle or the higher end of Band 1. Other aggravating factors were cited. It was a group attack on two victims by four persons (the three Accused persons and Muhammad Nurafiyan Bin Mohamed Sani (“Nurafiyan”) who has been dealt with), all of whom were voluntarily intoxicated at the time.

19     The Prosecution argued that in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_, the Court held that while the sentences for Band 1 cases may range from a fine to 4 weeks imprisonment, the sentence for a group attack will certainly cross the custodial threshold and may even exceed 4 weeks imprisonment. The Prosecution relied on the four cases listed in the table below where the sentences for group attacks in plead guilty cases ranged from 3 to 5 weeks imprisonment and reiterated their submissions for 1 month imprisonment in the present case.

20     The Prosecution further submitted that the Court ought not to make a distinction based on the role that each Accused person played. The one who landed the blow should not get a longer sentence than the rest. All three Accused persons shared the common intention to punch and kick and to cause hurt.

### Section 14(3), SA

21     The Prosecution next addressed the sentencing considerations for the offences under section 14(3), SA. The two factors highlighted were the length of the membership in the secret society and the seniority of the position held. The Accused persons’ involvement in the secret society were as follows:

> ■    Naqiuddin who was not traced was a member for 3 years and 10 months holding the rank of a ‘Fighter’.

> ■    Nafis who was also untraced was a member for 3 years. He was initially a ‘Fighter’ and then became a ‘Senior Member’.

> ■    Ra’iba had related antecedents for being detained under CLTPA for society membership. He had the shortest membership for 1 year 5 months but similarly held the higher rank of ‘Senior Member’.

> ■    Syafii was a member for 5 years 1 month and was also initially a ‘Fighter’ before becoming a ‘Senior Member’.

22     The Prosecution relied on the sentencing precedents listed in the table below for the applicable range of sentences. The sentence imposed in each of the cases cited was 3 months imprisonment. In _PP v Zackeer Abbass Khan_, the Accused person held a senior position (fighter rank) and was a member of the society for 25 years. In _PP v Cheng Chun Wei_, the Accused had been a member for five years, held a senior position as the Headman, and had recruited six other persons into the secret society. Nurafiyan, the co-Accused who had been dealt with earlier, was a member of the secret society for six years, held a senior rank of Headman, and faced two charges under the Societies Act.

23     The Prosecution submitted that the circumstances of the four Accused persons were not as aggravated as those in the cases cited, and their sentences ought to be calibrated downwards to range between 1 to 3 months imprisonment. It was submitted that Naqiuddin and Nafis be sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment, Ra’iba to be given a sentence of between 6 weeks to 2 months imprisonment, and Syafii be sentenced to 2 months imprisonment.

### Section 6(3), POHA

24     The Prosecution argued for a sentence of 2 weeks imprisonment for Syafii, highlighting two significant aggravating factors. He had reoffended whilst on bail and had related antecedents. The Prosecution pointed out that typically for offences where insulting words are used on a public service worker like a police officer, a fine is imposed. In the case of Syafii, he was arrested for the offence of causing hurt on 24 April 2019 and was released on bail. He committed the offence under section 6(3), POHA on 14 March 2020. His antecedents demonstrate a history of aggression in a public place. The first was for possession of an offensive instrument in 2008, then for the offence of affray in 2014, and to a lesser extent, the offence of causing damage on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender in 2016. These aggravating factors merit a custodial sentence and term of 2 weeks imprisonment would be appropriate.

### Total Sentence

25     Finally, the Prosecution argued that all the terms of imprisonment ought to run consecutively as each sentence addresses a distinct and separate legal interest. Each charge faced by the individual Accused person was a separate transaction.

## Mitigation Plea

26     The Defence made a lengthy oral mitigation plea and a response to the sentencing submissions by the Prosecution, countering that the Prosecution’s assertions that it was an unprovoked group attack by intoxicated individuals. The Defence argued that the Prosecution’s characterisation was a distortion of the facts. In truth, the victims and their friends were looking to retaliate against the earlier attack on Zafran. The victims and their friends formed a large group and they far outnumbered the four Accused persons in the subsequent confrontation. Given that all four Accused persons had pleaded guilty, they should be sentenced to a fine only. It was submitted that for the offence under section 323 read with section 34, PC, a fine of $3,000 for all except Ra’iba would suffice. Ra’iba deserved a higher fine of $4,000 as he is seen punching someone. The offence under section 14(3), SA, should attract a fine of no more than $2,000. That makes a total sentence of $5,000 and $6,000 respectively. For the offence under section 6(3), POHA, against Syafii, the Defence sought a fine of $5,000 but if the Court was minded to impose a term of imprisonment, it should be no more than 7 days. The Defence did not cite any case precedents in support.

27     The Defence during their oral submissions, made frequent reference to the video footage. Unfortunately, the footage was not concurrently played during the mitigation plea. It was screened subsequently during the Prosecution’s response to the mitigation plea. In brief, the Defence recounted their version of the sequence of events as follows.

28     The Defence stated that the Accused persons had gone out for the night and were at Club Fleek at about 4.17 am. At the time, Zafran and two of his friends, Seri and Haziq, had positioned themselves at the lobby at B1 outside the toilet. Two unnamed male individuals walked past Zafran and headed up the escalator. Zafran could be seen gesticulating and pointing at these two unidentified persons. Haziq tried to physically restrain Zafran. He tried to get in front of the two unidentified individuals. Zafran refused to be restrained. One of the two unidentified individuals punched Zafran. It was a big punch which floored him. The punch which he received landed in the area of his right and left maxillary. One of the two unidentified individuals gave a flying kick to Zafran’s chest causing him to fall. Zafran got up and charged back. The two unidentified male individuals went up the escalator and left. That was at about 4.18 am.

29     Zafran sat on the ledge of the escalator. Haziq and Seri were with him. Another friend, Nuur Syahidah, came down the escalator and joined the group. At about 4.27 am, Danial, Wong Wen Jie and a few others came down the escalator. There were about five to ten people milling around. At about 4.28 am, the club bouncer, Siraaj, arrived and Zafran tried to confront him when the bouncer was tried to usher the group out of the lobby and up the escalator. The group pulled away and refused to leave. People who came down the escalator to go to the bathroom had to navigate past this gang.

30     At about 4.32 am, Nurafiyan came down the escalator, with Ra’iba, Naqiuddin, and Nafis following behind, and they headed to the toilet. Firdaus Latif was behind them and he started shouting. All heads turned towards Firdaus Latif and one person from Zafran’s group went up to Firdaus Latif and caught him in a bear hug from behind to restrain him. Naqiuddin pushed Ra’iba ahead of him as if to say, ‘keep going’. Nafis went ahead past Ra’iba into the toilet. Syafii then came down the escalator and needed to walk through Zafran's group congregated at the bottom of the escalator. Naqiuddin went back to escort Syafii through the group and Nurafiyan was behind them. There was a man with a black cap squatting down next to Zafran and speaking to him.

31     As Naqiuddin, Syafii and Nurafiyan walked past the man with the black cap, he got up and made a bee line for Naqiuddin to try to confront him but the three of them kept walking. The next thing that happened was that the man with the black cap fell down and there was a commotion. Five persons from Zafran’s group ran through the glass doors and into the basement carpark. Firdaus Latif returned and was shouting “why you hit my friend” while being restrained by Syahidah. He then realised that the person on the floor was not Zafran and smiled or smirked at the Accused persons and Nurafiyan asking, “you all ok or not.” Meanwhile, the bouncer, Siraaj, tried to usher Naqiuddin, Ra’iba and Syafii upstairs. At the same time, Zafran’s group entered through the glass doors and rushed towards the Accused persons and Nurafiyan. Nurafiyan charged ahead towards Firdaus Latiff and hit him. He was followed by Ra’iba, Syafii Naqiuddin.

32     The Defence argued that the characterization that it was a group attack by the three Accused persons and Nurafiyan against two victims is inaccurate. It was actually an attack by about ten persons from Zafran’s group against the four of them. The Defence stated that Syafii could be seen grappling with two persons from Zafran’s group. Ra’iba could be seen fighting with someone and Naqiuddin was seen standing around guarding against a blow to himself. The skirmish was over in about 30 seconds when they all pulled themselves apart. Naqiuddin, Ra’iba, Syafii, and Hafis who had belatedly arrived, then left the scene. They went back up and out of the building into another carpark where they were confronted by 15-20 members of Zafran's group.

33     The Defence also argued that while it is not in dispute that the three Accused persons did in fact cause hurt, it is unclear if the injuries sustained by Zafran was caused by the assault by the three Accused persons or by the earlier attack by the two unknown persons.

34     The Defence concluded by stating that the incident at 4.17 am started because Zafran had picked on someone that he should not have. That someone had beat him up and Zafran and his friends spent the next 15 minutes refusing to leave the area despite being asked to. They were looking for the persons whom they thought had beaten up Zaffran. Those persons were not the four Accused persons. The four Accused persons had simply been out for the night with their friends. Their only mistake was to go to the bathroom at 4.32 am. When they tried to enter the bathroom, Zafran’s group had set upon them. The suggestion that this was a group attack by intoxicated individuals is simply unsustainable. The suggestion that it was an attack by four persons against the two victims is a distortion of the evidence. The reality is that the Accused persons had done their best to avoid being provoked by Firdaus Latiff. They had done their best to navigate this group which was looking for trouble. When the incident between Nurafiyan and the man in the black cap occurred, they were confronted by the group surging in from the carpark. The inclusion of section 34 of the Penal Code is not due to the fact that they were acting as some sort of a gang, but it is because the Prosecution cannot state with certainty who hit whom.

35     The Defence next dealt with the case precedents cited by the Prosecution. The Defence submitted that the facts in those cases are very different from the facts in the present case.

36     In the case of _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_, it was stated at paragraph 80 of the judgement, that a fine may be appropriate where the culpability is low. The Defence submitted that there is nothing which takes this case out of Band 1. The Defence further submitted that the Court needs to distinguish the various levels of culpability with Nurafiyan at one end of the spectrum, and Naqiuddin who was acting as the peace-maker at the other end.

> ■    In _PP v Andrew Lim_, the Accused person had claimed trial to a charge where he had punched the victim at the head and neck area while the co-Accused held him or restrained him. He was sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment.

> ■    In _PP v Nor Mohamad Azril_, the Accused faced 10 charges. The Accused had gone up to the victim whom he thought was a gang member, and punched him in the face unprovoked. He was sentenced to 1 month imprisonment.

> ■    In _PP v Sashikumar_, the Accused had claimed trial to a charge where he was part of a group surrounding the victim. An object was used in the assault and the Accused was already on police supervision under CLTPA. He was sentenced to 4 weeks imprisonment.

> ■    In _PP v Ashwin Kumar_, the Accused was a young offender who re-offended whilst on probation. He was part of a group of three persons who surrounded the victim and were punching and kicking the victim. He was sentenced to 3 weeks imprisonment.

37     The Defence further argued that for the offence under section 14(3), SA, the culpability which would attract a sentence of between 1 to 3 months imprisonment has to be something beyond the illegality of an unregistered society. There is nothing in the facts to infer the accused's level of participation in the unregistered society. For this reason, a fine alone would be appropriate for all four Accused persons.

38     The Defence submitted that for the offence under section 6(3), POHA, a fine of $5,000 would suffice. It was further submitted that if the Court was minded to impose an imprisonment sentence, it should be no more than 7 days. It was stated that Syafii accepts that what he said was inexcusable, but his reaction was borne out of his misunderstanding of what the hospital was trying to achieve. The incident was unfortunate but short-lived. The sole aggravating factor is that the offence was committed whilst Syafii was on bail. However, that fact alone does not justify transforming a sentence of fine which is typically imposed, to a 2 week imprisonment term. Similarly, Syafii’s past convictions for offences committed almost five years ago should not merit an uplift in sentence for either the causing hurt charge, or the section 6(3), POHA charge. There has been a considerable lapse of time, and an increase from a fine to a term of imprisonment is untenable and unsupportable.

39     The Defence also countered the Prosecution’s submission that the terms of imprisonment ought to run consecutively and argued that the membership in the society overlapped with the offence of causing hurt.

40     The Defence next proceeded to set out the personal circumstances and the mitigating factors for each Accused person.

> ■    Naqiuddin is recently married with one child aged 7 months. He is 27 years old, is untraced, and works as a station manager for SMRT. Since the commission of these offences, he has not reoffended and is no longer involved in this secret society or any other.

> ■    Nafis is 30 years old and works for an IT company providing technical support. He is scheduled to be married on 30 October 2021.

> ■    Ra’iba is 31 years old and is married with three children aged 4 years, 2 years, and 2 months. He works for a PV Vacuum and Engineering as a servicing engineer.

> ■    Syafii is 34 years old, is married with two children aged 17 years and 13 years. He works as a Grab delivery rider earning about $4,000 a month.

## The Prosecution’s Reply

41     The Prosecution screened the three clips of CCTV footage obtained from the camera located near to the toilet at Basement 1 of Marina Square, during their reply to the Defence’s submissions. The Prosecution referred to the footage and responded to each assertion made by the Defence. In brief, it was pointed out that the claim that Zafran’s group was being deliberately provocative was not borne out. They did not appear to be spoiling for a fight. The Accused persons were not outnumbered by Zafran’s friends during the assault. It was at all times a group attack by four persons against the two victims. The Prosecution did agree that the engagement was brief. The Prosecution conceded too that the injuries sustained by Zafran may have been caused or contributed to by the earlier attack on him. The Prosecution maintained that the aggravated circumstances cited earlier were present. On sentence, the Prosecution argued that there was only a brief overlap between the causing hurt offence and the offence under section 14(3), SA. This would be on 21 April 2019 when the offence under section 323 read with section 34, PC was committed. For the reasons cited earlier, the terms of imprisonment ought to run consecutively.

## Decision on Sentence

### Areas of dispute and agreement

42     The three clips of CCTV footage were viewed in Court during the PG hearing. There was some disagreement between the Prosecution and the Defence on the interpretation of the events captured in the footage. The parties’ position on the events as seen in the footage are set out in the table below. The areas of disagreement are highlighted.

![]([2021] SGDC 0269_Image/[2021] SGDC 0269_image2.png)

43     Having viewed all three clips of the footage, I arrived at the conclusion that the Defence’s characterisation of the events is not borne out by the CCTV footage. I agree with the Prosecution that Zafran’s friends were not milling around looking to retaliate. Several of Zafran’s friends, including Muhammad Rejab Bin Jumat (“Rejab”), Seri Umeera Binte Suhariey (“Seri”) Muhammad Azri Bin Azhari (“Azri”), Mohammad Haziq Bin Mohamed Isnin (“Haziq”) as well as the bouncer from Club Fleek, Syed Siraaj Alsagoff Bin Zainul Abedeen (“Siraaj”), were seen talking to him, consoling him, or simply standing or sitting next to him passively. There was no evidence that they were seeking out the persons who had attacked Zafran.

44     The sole individual from the group, apart from Zafran, who was upset about the attack was Muhammad Firdaus Bin Abdul Latif (“Firdaus Latif”). The unknown person with a black cap was not seen confronting anyone either. Firdaus Latif was seen shouting angrily as he came down the escalator. He later charged forward when he thought that Zafran was attacked again but was mollified when he discovered that this was not so, and was in fact seen smiling at the Accused persons, just before he was punched in the face by Muhammad Nurafiyan Bin Mohamed Sani (“Nurafiyan”). Naqiuddin, Syafii and Ra'iba joined in the assault on Firdaus Latif. When Zafran came out of the toilet, he rushed forward to defend Firdaus Latif and was in turn assaulted by the Accused persons. It was an attack on two persons, Zafran and Firdaus Latif, by the three Accused persons and Nurafiyan.

45     I similarly agreed with the prosecution that it did not appear that the group was causing an obstruction to persons wanting to use the toilet. Several individuals were able to use the toilet without any difficulty.

46     To sum up the following were observed from the CCTV footage:

> ·    It was a group attack;

> ·    It was an unprovoked attack;

> ·    Nurafiyan struck the first blow;

> ·    The three Accused persons actively participated in the assault; and

> ·    The attack lasted for about one minute.

### Sentencing Approach for s 323 r/w s 34, PC

47     In determining sentence, I adopted the two-step approach set out in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_. The first was to identify the applicable sentencing band and to determine where this case fell within the band to arrive at the appropriate indicative starting point. The second was to make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point based on an assessment of the offender’s culpability as well as the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. This may take the eventual sentence out of the indicative sentencing range initially identified.

### Applying the two-step sentencing framework

#### The harm caused by the Accused persons

48     The main _harm_ factor here is the injury sustained by each of the two victims. Zafran was seen at the Emergency Department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and was noted to have swelling over the right maxillary area with abrasion measuring 1cm, mild bruising over the left maxillary region, and superficial abrasion and scratch over the right side of the neck. He was given five days of medical leave. Firdaus Latif did not seek medical treatment.

49     It was common ground between the Prosecution and the Defence that the level of harm caused would fall within Band 1 which attracts a fine or a short custodial sentence of up to four weeks. This would be the indicative starting point for a first-time offender who pleads guilty. I am in agreement with this position adopted by the parties.

50     The Prosecution further submitted that within Band 1, this offence would fall at the middle to higher end of the band as Zafran was given a lengthy medical leave for five days. I was not persuaded that this fact alone would push the indicative starting sentence towards the middle or higher end of Band 1, especially in view of the position adopted by both the Prosecution and the Defence that it was not at all apparent from the facts if the earlier attack on Zafran had caused or contributed to his injuries.

51     I next turn to assess the Accused persons’ culpability and the other relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.

#### The other relevant factors

52     I considered the main _culpability_ factors in the present case to be as follows:

> (a)     It was an unprovoked attack. The Accused persons acted without provocation from the victims, Zafran and Firdaus Latiff. Firdaus Latiff may have charged forward initially but he immediately withdrew when he realised that the person on the floor was not Zafran. Zafran was still in the toilet at the time. While the attack may have been triggered by Nurafiyan, there was no cause for the three Accused persons to join in the attack on Firdaus Latiff and later on Zafran. They could have restrained and removed Nurafiyan from the scene. Instead, they had escalated the assault by Nurafiyan into a group attack.

> (b)     It was a group attack by four persons against two victims. This was clear from the three clips of the CCTV footage. Firdaus Latiff had rushed in alone, albeit as he was being held back by Syahidah. He was still alone when the assault on him began. Zafran ran to his aid only after Firdaus Latiff was chased into the basement carpark by Nurafiyan and the three Accused persons. The others from Zafran’s group, a number of whom were women, and the bouncers from Club Fleek, were seen trying to break up the fight. Eventually, Seri hugged Firdaus Latiff from behind and the two of them toppled to the floor, where Seri continued to shield him with her body. Fortunately, Seri was not hit in the process.

> (c)     The Accused persons had consumed alcoholic drinks which had evidently influenced their behaviour. They had launched into the attack without restraint or forethought for the consequences. Offences committed whilst intoxicated or inebriated after voluntary consumption of alcohol has consistently been viewed by the sentencing courts as elevating the culpability of the offender.

> (d)     The Accused persons faced a TIC charge for being a member of an unlawful assembly with the common object to cause hurt, an offence under section 143, PC. In _Public Prosecutor v UI_, [^2] the Court of Appeal observed that where TIC offences are present, the effect in general would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with, would be increased. This must be especially so in the present case where the TIC charge is for an offence involving similar unruly public behaviour.

53     I next considered the other relevant aggravating and mitigating factors.

> (a)     I have noted that the actual assault was short-lived and lasted no more than about one minute from about 4:33 am to 4:34 am. This was in no small part due to the fact that the bouncers from Club Fleek had arrived to break up the fight.

> (b)     The offence appears to be a spontaneous or impulsive act committed on the spur of the moment. It was not premeditated with any degree of thought and planning involved.

> (c)     The Accused persons have pleaded guilty at the first opportunity when the reduced charge was offered to them. I have noted this in their favour as an indication of their remorse.

> (d)     I have similarly noted their background and individual circumstances. I accept that they are all gainfully employed and providing for their families.

> (e)     Naiquiddin was untraced for past criminal offences and this was his first brush with the law. Ra’iba and Syafii however have antecedents which date back to 2007 and 2008 respectively. These antecedents were taken into account in computing the sentences for the other offences which they face. I emphasise that I have not taken into account these antecedents for the present offence to avoid a double counting.

### Calibrating the appropriate sentence for s 323 r/w s 34, PC

54     This offence under section 323 read with section 34, PC, was committed in 2019, prior to the legislative enhancements to the penalty which took effect in 2020. The prescribed punishment here is up to 2 years imprisonment or a fine of up to $5,000, or both.

55     I next turned to consider the case precedents cited by the Prosecution. They were understandably few in number, as there are not too many reported cases post-_Low Seng Chye_. I nevertheless found them helpful and relevant to my assessment, as all them involved somewhat analogous facts, and provided a general indication of the sentencing range for a similar factual matrix.

56     In _PP v Andrew Lim_, the Accused and the co-Accused had rained blows to the victim’s face and neck area while another co-Accused held him immobile. They were at the pavement along Prinsep Street at about 11.00 pm. The victim sustained multiple injuries mainly on his face and close to sensitive areas like his eyes. He was given five days of outpatient sick leave. The Accused who had claimed trial to the charge under section 323 read with section 34, PC, was sentenced to 6 weeks imprisonment. His appeal against conviction and sentence is pending. The co-Accused who had also assaulted the victim, pleaded guilty to a similar charge and was sentenced to 5 weeks imprisonment.

57      _PP v Nor Mohamad Azril_ involved a one-on-one fight. The Accused faced one charge under section 323, PC for punching the victim in the face in a club. It was an unprovoked attack. While there were others present at the scene, they did not take part in the assault. That same night, the victim was later involved in a motor accident and suffered severe injuries. The nature of his injuries from the fight with the Accused was not ascertained. However, based on the evidence, the Court concluded that this was a Band 1 case. The Accused had one drug antecedent. He was sentenced to 1 month imprisonment. His appeal against sentence was dismissed.

58     In _PP v Sashikumar_, the victim was attacked by the Accused and three others along the corridor of an office building. An object was used in the assault and the victim sustained multiple injuries to vulnerable parts of his body - his face and head. The Accused persons had claimed trial to the charge under section 323 read with section 34, PC. The Court held that this case fell at the borderline between Band 1 and Band 2 and noted that it was a sustained group attack. The Accused was sentenced to 10 weeks imprisonment. A co-Accused who suffered from kidney failure was sentenced to 4 weeks imprisonment. Their appeals against conviction and sentence were later withdrawn.

59     In _PP v Ashwin Kumar_, the Accused was 20 years old when he re-offended whilst on probation. He was involved in a dispute with two co-Accused persons when the victim intervened. The group then turned on the victim as a group and punched and kicked him. The victim suffered pain but did not seek medical treatment. The Accused pleaded guilty to the charge under section 323 read with section 34, PC, and was sentenced to 3 weeks imprisonment. He withdrew his appeal against sentence.

60     It is also appropriate to look at the outcome of the case against the co-Accused, Nurafiyan, who had been dealt with earlier. The rioting charge against him under section 147, PC was maintained, and was TIC for sentencing for his other offences, including drug offences and the offence under section 14(3), SA. He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for the section 14(3), SA offence.

61     The Prosecution’s table of sentencing precedents showed that while each case had its own offence and offender-specific facts which may not feature in the present case, they did demonstrate that where the attack involved a group of accused persons who outnumbered the victim(s), the custody threshold was invariably crossed. This was evident even where the harm caused was low and fell within Band 1. I am of the view that the same applies here, and a term of imprisonment is warranted.

62     It is undisputed that Nurafiyan was the aggressor in this incident, but it was the three Accused persons who had escalated it into a group attack. They had participated by punching the victims. Naqiuddin is seen on the CCTV throwing a punch, while Ra’iba swings his right arm, and Syafii adopts a fighting stance. All three played active roles in the assault. A group fight in a public place causes consternation and fear to everyone around. People worry that the fight might escalate and lead to serious outcomes. It prompts bystanders to intervene, often risking their own safety. In this case, the two women from Zafran’s group, Syahidah and Seri, were obviously fearful that the fight would spiral out of control, and actively tried to end the fight or stop it from even starting. Others from Zafran’s group were similarly seen intervening. Fortunately, none of them was hurt. A group fight clearly merits a stiffer sentence.

63     The influence of alcohol in this incident is obvious. Its uninhibiting effects led to reckless behaviour causing the three Accused persons to lunge forward with no provocation. It provided Dutch courage to even those who had previously been law abiding. Naqiuddin who was untraced had readily joined in the attack. Their offending bahaviour continued into the incident particularised in the TIC charge.

64     In summary, after careful consideration of the entire factual matrix of the present case and all the relevant precedents cited, I was of the view that a sentence of a fine would be wholly inappropriate. The imprisonment sentence should remain within Band 1 as the harm caused was low and there were some mitigating factors. It must, however, fall at the higher end of Band 1 given the aggravated circumstances. With this range in mind, I concluded that the offence merits a sentence of 4 weeks imprisonment.

65     I agreed with the Prosecution that an offence under section 34, PC, does not require the Court to distinguish between each participant’s involvement, so long as it is agreed that they shared the common intention to commit the offence. Here, the three Accused persons had admitted without reservation to acting in concert in furtherance of their common intention to cause hurt. Hence, I make no distinction in the sentence based on the roles played by each of them.

### Sentencing Approach for s 14(3), SA

66     The offence under section 14(3), SA, is punishable with a sentence of up to 3 years or a fine of not more than $5,000, or both. The role of the Societies Act is too weed out unsavoury groups which may be used for unlawful purposes. The Registrar of Societies acts as the gatekeeper and rejects an application if it appears that registering the society may pose a threat to public order and welfare.[^3] Secret societies, well known for their illicit activities, remain as unlawful societies under the Societies Act.

67     The sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution indicate that the sentencing tariff for this offence is a custodial sentence of about 3 months imprisonment. The offence is made out once membership in an unlawful society is proved. Participation in unlawful activities through the membership is an aggravating factor attracting a higher punishment.

68     In _PP v Zackeer Abbass Khan and Anwer Ambiya_, at para 146, the Court dealt with the co-Accused _Anwer Ambiya bin Kadir Maideen._ He pleaded guilty to one charge under section 14(3), SA. Two similar charges were taken into consideration. The District Judge stated that the sentencing benchmark for a senior member of a secret society holding a fighter rank was at least 3 months’ imprisonment. The accused was a member of the secret society for 25 years. He had not openly or actively declared his secret society affiliations. He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment. The sentence was affirmed on appeal.

69     In _PP v Cheng Chun Wei_ the Accused was a member of the _Pak Hai Tong_ triad society of the _Ji It_ group for about five years from 28 February 2014 to 2 January 2019. He held the rank of Headman. He accepted about six other persons into the society under his leadership as Headman but did not brief them on their roles as they were already affiliated gang members. The District Judge aligned himself with the sentence affirmed by the High Court’s in _PP v Zackeer Abbass Khan and Answer Ambiya_ and imposed a sentence of 3 months imprisonment.

70     The co-Accused Nurafiyan was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for the charge under section 14(3), SA. A similar charge was TIC for sentencing purposes.

71     The case precedents show that holding membership in an unlawful society per se is met with a sentence of at least 3 months imprisonment. They involved long years of membership or a higher participation in the society’s activity. The four Accused persons here face a single charge each under section 14(3), SA. Taking into account their rank in the secret society and the duration of their membership, as well as similar antecedents if any, I arrived at the following sentences.

72     Naqiuddin and Nafis are both untraced. Naqiuddin had a longer membership but Nafis held a higher rank. There were no other aggravating factors present. I agreed with the Prosecution that 6 weeks imprisonment is appropriate for both of them.

73     Syafii holds the longest membership and a senior rank. Ra’iba has the shortest membership but a related antecedent under CLTPA for secret society membership. They merit an uplift to the sentence on account of these factors. They were each sentenced to 8 weeks imprisonment.

### Sentencing Approach for s 6(3), POHA

74     This offence is punishable with a fine of not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both. I acknowledged the Prosecution’s submission that typically an offence under this provision would attract a fine only. In this case however, there were several aggravating factors intrinsic to the offence and other aggravated factors specific to the offender.

75     The victim here was public service officer who was a healthcare worker performing his duty. Syafii was intoxicated when he hurled the vulgarities at the victim. It was argued in mitigation that Syafii was being a Good Samaritan and was helping a neighbour who seemed unwell. I fail to see anything meritorious in Syafii acts as he had arrived at the hospital drunk and unruly. Syafii had committed this offence while he was on bail for the offence of causing hurt. His re-offending showed persistent recalcitrance, especially in light of his antecedents. I agreed with the Prosecution that his antecedents showed a propensity for aggression in a public place. He had antecedents for possession of offensive instruments, affray and causing damage on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender. I was of the firm view that a sentence of two weeks imprisonment was appropriate for this offence.

### Total Sentence

76     The Prosecution submitted that each charge against the Accused persons addressed a separate legal interest. They do not overlap in time save for a very brief period of one day, when the offence of causing hurt was committed. The Accused persons were members of the secret society at the time. The Prosecution urged for an order for all sentences to run consecutively. I was in agreement with the Prosecutions submissions and ordered all the sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively.

## Conclusion

77     In conclusion, I am of the view that the imprisonment sentences which I had imposed are appropriate and justified. They are neither crushing nor manifestly excessive.

78     The Accused persons are on bail pending appeal. They have been granted a stay of execution of their sentence pending appeal.
