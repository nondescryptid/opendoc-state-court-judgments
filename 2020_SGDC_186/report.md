Tort – Negligence – Breach of Duty

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in HC/DCA 26/2020 and HC/DCA 30/2020.\]

20 August 2020

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Introduction

1       This case involves a traffic accident between an electric scooter (ridden by the Plaintiff) and a motorcar driven by the 1st Defendant with the 2nd Defendant as the passenger seated at the front seat next to the 1st Defendant, along Boon Lay Way at about 6pm on 11 October 2016. In the accident, the Plaintiff had collided into the opened front left passenger door of the motorcar. Just before the collision, the 2nd Defendant had opened the door with the intention to alight from the motorcar. At the material time of the accident, riding an electric scooter on the road does not contravene any traffic rules.

2       I heard the case on 18 March 2020. Written submissions were filed on 22 June 2020. I delivered my oral grounds on 21 July 2020. Both sides have, on 29 July 2020 and 3 August 2020 respectively, filed their cross appeals against my decision. Pursuant to their appeals, these are my grounds of decision.

## The parties’ cases

### The Plaintiff’s Account

3       As both sides have given a different account of how the accident happened, I will first describe each party’s account.

4       According to the Plaintiff, he was travelling close to the kerb on the leftmost lane of Boon Lay Way towards the direction of Jurong East at a speed of about 20kmph. As he approached the junction between Boon Lay Way and Jalan Boon Lay, he saw the traffic light was showing red (“the traffic light had shown red for 15 to 20 seconds already”[^1]) and that the traffic was heavy. The Defendants’ car was one of the many stationary vehicles on the leftmost lane as the vehicles were waiting for the traffic light to change to green.[^2] As he was riding close to the kerb, the Defendants’ car door suddenly opened without warning, leaving him insufficient time to react, thereby causing him to collide into the opened door and he fell to the ground[^3]. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, the Plaintiff said that after the collision, he recalled that none of the Defendants’ signal lights was on[^4].

### The Defendants’ Accounts

5       According to the 2nd Defendant, the 1st Defendant was going to drop her off along Boon Lay Way. The car they were in came to a stop and the 2nd Defendant said she checked the left side mirror to ensure that there was no oncoming traffic before opening the car door[^5]. The 2nd Defendant said that she did not know where the Plaintiff came from as he was not there when she checked for oncoming traffic before opening the car door.

6       The 1st Defendant’s testimony is that he was driving on the leftmost lane. When the car was approaching Boon Lay MRT station, he turned on his hazard lights, checked the side mirrors and left blind spot and ascertained that the road was clear with no vehicle overtaking on the left side before coming to a stop just after a bus bay[^6].

7       It is not disputed that the 1st Defendant accepted the offer of composition from the Traffic Police for “permitting door to be opened which caused danger to others.” The 1st Defendant said he accepted the composition fine not because he thought he was in the wrong but because, he did not want to drag on the matter.

## Facts In Dispute

8       Based on the different accounts of the accident, the facts that are in dispute give rise to the following issues:

> (a)     Whether the traffic light was red and the vehicles on the leftmost lane, including the Defendants’ car, were stationary

> (b)     Whether the Defendants’ car’s hazard lights were on

9       Ultimately, the issue of liability and apportionment of liability between the parties will depend on my finding as to whose account is more credible and more consistent with or supported by available evidence given by way of affidavits of evidence in chief and oral testimonies in cross-examination in court.

10     The Plaintiff has also pleaded the following particulars negligence as against the 1st Defendant[^7]:

> (a)     Stopping the Defendants’ car at a non-designated drop-off point and allowing the passenger to alight and to open the front passenger door of the Defendants’ car without ensuring it was safe to do so;

> (b)     Allowing the 2nd Defendant to alight and to open the front passenger door of the Defendants’ car and/or permitting any door of the Defendants’ car to be opened so as to cause injury or danger to the Plaintiff;

> (c)     Allowing or causing the Plaintiff’s e-scooter to collide into the front passenger door of the Defendants’ car;

> (d)     Failing to keep any or any proper lookout or to have any or any sufficient regard for traffic that was or might reasonably be expected to be on the Road;

> (e)     Failing to pay any or any sufficient heed to the presence of the Plaintiff’s e-scooter on the Road;

> (f)     Failing to notice the Plaintiff’s e-scooter in sufficient time to avoid the said collision or at all;

> (g)     Failing to exercise reasonable care, skill and prudence in the driving, management and control of the Defendants’ car by the 1st Defendant; and

> (h)     Failing to keep reasonable control over 2nd Defendant.

11     The Plaintiff has pleaded the following particulars against the 2nd Defendant:

> (a)     Alighting from 1st Defendant’s car at a non-designated drop-off point without ensuring it was safe to do so;

> (b)     Alighting and opening the front passenger door of 1st Defendant’s car so as to cause injury or danger to Plaintiff;

> (c)     Allowing or causing Plaintiff’s e-scooter to collide into the front passenger door of 1st Defendant’s car;

> (d)     Failing to keep any or any proper lookout or to have any or any sufficient regard for traffic that was or might reasonably be expected to be on the Road;

> (e)     Failing to pay any or any sufficient heed to the presence of Plaintiff’s e-scooter on the Road; and

> (f)     Failing to notice Plaintiff’s e-scooter in sufficient time to avoid the said collision or at all.

In addition to issues arising from the different accounts of the parties as to how the accident happened, the Plaintiff’s pleaded case against the Defendants also gives rise to these additional issues:

> (g)     Whether the 1st Defendant was negligent in stopping his car at the accident location due to the accident location not being a designated place for drop-off

> (h)     Whether the 1st Defendant was negligent in stopping his car in an unsafe manner for other road users

> (i)     Whether the 2nd Defendant was negligent in opening the car door without ascertaining it was safe to do so

## My Decision

### Whether the traffic light was red and the vehicles on the leftmost lane, including the Defendants’ car, were stationary

12     In his affidavit of evidence in chief, the Plaintiff said that when he was approaching the junction of Boon Lay Way and Jalan Boon Lay, he saw that “_the traffic light was red_ and noticed that the rush hour traffic was very heavy”[^8] and that “_the traffic light of the said traffic junction had been red for about 15-20 seconds already_”[^9]. The Plaintiff cited these as the reason why he “_could not have anticipated the 2nd Defendant to suddenly open the car door_ along the road”[^10]. (emphasis mine)

13     Based on the Plaintiff’s account, the 1st Defendant’s car would have stopped near the traffic light junction when the 2nd Defendant opened the car door of the front passenger seat of the 1st Defendant’s car.

14     When asked to mark out the position of the traffic lights (marked X)[^11] and the accident location (marked Y)[^12] in the documents submitted in court[^13], the positions marked by the Plaintiff show the traffic light junction to be quite far away from the accident location. In cross-examination, the Plaintiff himself gave the distance as 30-40 metres[^14]. It is noted that the accident location marked as Y is near a green rubbish bin located on the other side of the zebra crossing that is situated right after the bus stop behind the accident location[^15].

15     Based on the Google Map screenshots submitted by the Defendants, from where the Plaintiff has marked out as the accident location, no traffic light is visible, that is, there is no traffic light junction within sight from the alleged accident location[^16]. Instead, an overhead bridge is seen at about a few car lengths away. The Google Map screenshots submitted by the Defendants show the traffic lights to be far beyond the overhead bridge and that from the accident location as marked out by the Plaintiff, the traffic lights could not be seen.

16     The 1st Defendant, in cross-examination, informed the court that a driver would not be able to see the traffic lights when approaching the accident location because of the distance between the traffic light junction and the accident location and because of the curvature of the road[^17].

17     Based on the Google Map screenshots, it is clear to me that the traffic lights could not be seen from the accident location. Therefore, even if the traffic lights had turned red as alleged by the Plaintiff, neither the Plaintiff nor the 1st Defendant could have seen it. The Plaintiff’s testimony that the traffic light had turned red therefore lacks credibility. Based on this, it is also highly improbable that the vehicles around the vicinity of the accident location were stationery as alleged by the Plaintiff. The Defendants’ description of the road condition is more in sync with the Google Map screenshots. As the Plaintiff’s veracity regarding the state of the traffic lights has been called into question, the Plaintiff’s evidence regarding the traffic light being red and regarding the traffic flow cannot be taken at face value.

18     Therefore, the Plaintiff has not shown that the traffic light was red and that the vehicles on the leftmost lane, including the Defendants’ car, were stationary.

19     Nevertheless, it is not disputed that the traffic was heavy at the material time of the collision[^18].

### Whether the Defendants’ car’s hazard lights were on

20     In the Plaintiff’s pleaded case, the Plaintiff stated that “_(a)ll of a sudden without warning_, the front passenger door of the (1st Defendant’s) car was opened”[^19]. In his affidavit of evidence in chief, similarly, the Plaintiff alleged that the 1st Defendant’s front passenger door suddenly opened without warning[^20]. However, in cross-examination, the Plaintiff readily conceded that he saw that the hazard lights of the 1st Defendant’s car was on when he was seated on the pavement after the collision.

> Q    So, you are saying while you’re on the ground, you were actually paying attention to the Defendant’s car signal lights?

> A    Your Hon---Your Honour, I was sitting at the pavement in front the Defendant’s car. I can see the Defendant’s car signal light.

> Q    So, it was on or not on?

> A    It’s on, Your Honour.

> Q    Okay. Okay. Those are my instructions that the signals were on, okay? So, if you can see that the Defendant’s car’s signal lights were on, why did you put in your affidavit that the signal lights were not on?

> A    Your Honour, for the paragraph 8, it’s when I was approaching, Your Honour, I did not see whether the light was on or not, Your Honour. That---what I---I give earlier because after the impact I was sitting---

> Q    Okay.

> A    I saw the lights on, Your Honour.

> Q    Okay. So, when you’re approaching the Defendant’s car, would I be correct to say you are not sure whether the lights were on or not?

> A    Yes, Your Honour. I did not notice whether light is on whether---

> Q    Okay.

> A    when I was approaching.

> Q    Alright. So, after the impact you saw the lights on?

> A    Yes, Your Honour.

> Q    Okay. So, I want to come back to my question. You said, “After the collision, I recalled that none of the signal lights were on.” So, why did you say it?

> A    Your Honour, after the collision when I was sitting down, I saw the signal light is on. Prior to that, I did not see---I did not s---notice the signal light is on or not, Your Honour.[^21]

21     This is contrasted with what he has stated in his affidavit of evidence in chief, in which, he said, “After the collision, I recalled that none of its signal lights were on.”[^22] In cross examination, he clarified that when he was sitting down at the pavement after the collision he saw the signal light was on, but, prior to that, he did not notice if the signal light was on or not.

22     In light of the Plaintiff’s inconsistency and clarifications in cross-examination, I am more inclined to accept the 1st Defendant’s version in his police report that he had turned on the hazard light before stopping his vehicle[^23].

23     Therefore, on this issue, I would accept the 1st Defendant’s version that the 1st Defendant’s hazard lights were on.

24     Based on the foregoing findings, I therefore conclude that the accident location was not near the traffic light junction as claimed by the Plaintiff, the vehicles around the 1st Defendant’s car were not stationary and the hazard lights of the 1st Defendant’s car were on.

### My findings as to how the accident happened

25     The 1st Defendant has alleged that he “had ascertained that the road was clear with no vehicle trying to overtake (_him_) on the left before stopping by the road side”[^24]. The 2nd Defendant has also alleged that when the 1st Defendant’s car stopped along the leftmost lane of Boon Lay Way, she had checked the left side-mirror of the 1st Defendant’s car to ensure that there was no oncoming traffic before opening the car door[^25].

26     While it was not clear as to why neither of the Defendants saw the Plaintiff even though they had allegedly checked for oncoming traffic, it is a fact that the Plaintiff’s e-scooter was behind the Defendants’ car. If the Plaintiff had come from the straight road as alleged by the Plaintiff, then the Plaintiff would have seen that the Defendants’ car ahead of him had hazard lights on and had come to a stop. The Plaintiff coming from behind ought to have kept a proper lookout for the vehicles and traffic in front of him.

27     As the Plaintiff ought to have seen that the hazard lights of the Defendants’ car were on, the Plaintiff ought to have taken action to avoid the collision as it is highly foreseeable that a passenger would be coming out of the Defendants’ car given that the hazard lights were on. If the Plaintiff had not realized that the Defendants’ car had hazard lights were on, then the Plaintiff must have been travelling at a fast speed.

28     It is also clear that the Plaintiff was attempting to overtake the Defendant’s car and in overtaking the Defendant’s car, the Plaintiff was doing so from the left. The Plaintiff ought not to have attempted to overtake the Defendants’ car. Further, if the Plaintiff was attempting to overtake the Defendants’ car, he ought to have done so from the right side or offside of the Defendants’ car. That would have been safer than to overtake on the left and squeezing past the 1st Defendant’s car.

29     In the circumstances, I find that the accident is caused by the following negligent acts of the Plaintiff:

> (a)     his failure to keep a proper lookout for the Defendants’ car that had stopped in front of him;

> (b)     his failure to notice that the Defendant’s car’s hazard lights were on showing the Defendants’ intention to alight a passenger

> (c)     his failure to slow down or stop to give way to the Defendants’ car and passengers alighting therefrom;

> (d)     riding at a fast speed or at an inappropriate speed given the heavy road condition at the material time;

> (e)     attempting to overtake the Defendants’ stationary car from the left or attempting to overtake the Defendants’ stationary car in an unsafe manner or when it was unsafe to do so.

30     Nevertheless, it is not to say that the Defendants are entirely not at fault at all. I will move on to address the issues arising from the Plaintiff’s pleaded case and to make my findings as to whether the Defendants are also contributorily negligent and if so, what is the proportion of liability they should bear.

### Whether the 1st Defendant was negligent in stopping his car at the accident location due to the accident location not being a designated drop-off point

31     In summary, the premise of the Plaintiff’s case against the Defendants is based on the 1st Defendant stopping his car at a non-designated drop-off point and allowing the 2nd Defendant to alight when it was not safe to do so. In the Plaintiff’s affidavit of evidence in chief, the Plaintiff alleged, “the accident took place next to the pick-up and drop-off point just before Jurong Point Shopping Centre where there was another pick-up and drop-off point” and that he “did not expect the 2nd Defendant to alight from a vehicle along the said road instead of at the proper drop-off point less than 20m away.”

32     It is not in dispute that the 1st Defendant’s car was stationary just after the bus bay along the said road when he allowed the 2nd Defendant to alight. It is also not disputed that the 2nd Defendant did not alight at a designated pick-up or drop-off point. The fact is also that the Defendant had stopped in such a way that the distance between the car and the kerb was sufficient for the Plaintiff’s e-scooter to squeeze through that space.

33     As I have found the Plaintiff’s account to be inconsistent and thus, less credible and reliable compared to the Defendants’ account, I would accept the 1st Defendant’s account that he had checked his rear view mirror and side view mirror before stopping his car. Upon such checks, the 1st Defendant said he did not see the Plaintiff at all[^26].

34     Now, coming to the question of whether the 1st Defendant had been negligent in stopping his car at an undesignated drop off point, counsel for the Plaintiff argued that both Defendants had admitted in cross-examination that the accident would not have happened if the 1st Defendant had not stopped his car there:

> In relation to the 1st Defendant [^27]:

> Q    to measure. You know, roughly 15, 20 metres. You did not drop off Ms. Leong at that drop off point, correct?

> A    No.

> Q    Okay. If you had dropped her off at that point, then this incident wouldn't have happened, correct?

> A    You are right.

> In relation to the 2nd Defendant [^28]

> Q    All I wanted to say is that, if he had dropped you at Jurong Point, this accident wouldn't have happened, correct? If he would drop you at Jurong Point, of course this accident won't happen, right?

> A    Yah. Correct.

35     Counsel for the Plaintiff argued that this amounts to an admission of liability in that the Defendants have themselves admitted that the accident would not have happened if the 1st Defendant had not stopped his car there.

36     I do not agree. While it is true that the accident would not have happened if the 1st Defendant had not stopped his car there to allow the 2nd Defendant to alight there, the Defendants’ liability depends on whether the 1st Defendant had stopped at a place where it is not reasonably foreseeable that the 1st Defendant would do so or where it is unsafe to do so.

37     The Plaintiff’s position is also that the 1st Defendant should have dropped the 2nd Defendant off at a designated drop-off point, either at the Jurong Point pick-up and drop-off point, or at the taxi stand and passenger pick-up point located to the left of the accident location.[^29]

38     When the 1st Defendant was questioned as to why he did not drop the 2nd Defendant off at the pick-up and drop-off point located to the left of the accident location, the 1st Defendant had explained that firstly, he was not aware that that was a pick-up and drop-off point. He said he thought that he was not allowed to pick up and drop off people at the pick-up point.[^30] The 1st Defendant further explained that the signboard indicated that to be a “taxi stand and passenger pick up point”, and that in hindsight, he was of the view that stopping there would expose him to even more risks.[^31] He further explained that even if he had known that it was a pick-up point, he would follow the wording of the sign by not dropping a passenger off there.[^32] The 1st Defendant also argues that there is nothing in the wording of the sign[^33] that suggests that it was a designated drop-off point. Counsel for the 1st Defendant argues that on its face, the wording clearly describes the pick-up point as a waiting point for taxis and for drivers to pick up their passengers.

39     In closing submissions, counsel for the Defendants pointed to various provisions in the Schedule to the Road Traffic (Traffic Signs) Rules. The gist is that there is no provision which states that stopping in the vicinity where there is a “pick-up” sign but not at the area designated in the “pick-up” sign is a breach of traffic rules.

40     On the whole, I find that the Plaintiff has not tendered any evidence to show that there was a designated drop-off point and that the Defendant has committed a traffic offence or breached any traffic rules by stopping his car at the accident location. The sign merely says, “Taxi stand and passenger pick up point”. Counsel for the Plaintiff has not pointed to any provision in the Highway Code or any relevant rules to say that the presence of such a sign board has the significance of making the stopping of cars in the nearby vicinity but not at the designated point a breach of traffic rules. I therefore find that the Plaintiff has not shown that the 1st Defendant ought not to have stopped his car at the accident location which was a “non-designated drop-off point” or that the 1st Defendant is somehow prohibited from stopping his car at the accident location.

41     In any event, it is not a matter of whether the place where the 1st Defendant stopped his car is or is not a designated drop off point. The relevant question to ask is whether the 1st Defendant stopped his car in an unsafe manner. Therefore, nothing turns on the fact that the 1st Defendant had stopped his car at a non-designated drop-off point, even if it is shown that there is a designated drop-off point in the vicinity.

### Whether the 1st Defendant was negligent in stopping his car in an unsafe location for other road users

42     As I have stated, the issue is not whether the accident location is or is not a designated drop-off point. The issue for my determination is whether the Defendant’s act of stopping at the accident location to allow the 2nd Defendant to alight is a negligent act. On this issue, I will proceed to address the Plaintiff’s case that the 1st Defendant was not supposed to stop or park his vehicle within 9 metres of a bus stop. To this, the 1st Defendant had replied in cross-examination that the Plaintiff was right, but his position is that stopping to alight passengers was allowed.[^34]

43     On whether the 1st Defendant had breached any traffic rule in stopping his car at the accident location, counsel for the Defendants submitted that the prohibition referred to by the Plaintiff is Rule 91 of the Highway Code, which reads as follows:[^35]

> **91**.    Do not park (which means to bring a motor vehicle to a stationary position and cause it to wait for any purpose) or let your vehicle stand —

>> (_i_)    within—

>> (ii)   9 metes (30 feet) on either side of a bus stop.

44     Counsel for the Defendants submitted that the 1st Defendant had not parked his vehicle by the roadside at the time of the accident because “park” as defined in the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (2004 Ed) means:[^36]

> “park” means to bring a motor vehicle or a trailer to a stationary position and cause it to wait for any purpose _other than that of immediately taking up or setting down persons, goods or luggage_ (emphasis mine).

45     I note that the evidence is clear that the 1st Defendant had only meant to stop for a few seconds for the 2nd Defendant to alight.[^37] Based on the clear reading of the Highway Code and the definition of “park” in the Road Traffic Act, it is clear that stopping a car to allow a passenger to alight is not in breach of any traffic rule. The Plaintiff has therefore not established that the 1st Defendant is prohibited from dropping off the 2nd Defendant at the accident location as “the immediate setting down of a passenger” is clearly not included within the definition of “park” that is envisaged in rule 91 of the Highway Code.

46     In the circumstances, the Plaintiff has not shown that the 1st Defendant had contravened Rule 91 of the Highway Code in the manner alleged by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff has therefore not shown that the 1st Defendant was prohibited from stopping his car at the accident location to allow the 2nd Defendant to alight there.

47     Nevertheless, this does not mean that the 1st Defendant is not negligent at all when he stopped his car at the accident location to allow the 2nd Defendant to alight. The issue is not whether the 1st Defendant is or is not prohibited from stopping his car to allow the 2nd Defendant to alight at the accident location but whether or not he had failed to exercise due care in stopping his car there. With respect to this, it is not in dispute that the accident location is a short distance away from the bus bay. It is the responsibility of all road users to drive their vehicles and exercise due care in the use of roads so as not to pose foreseeable risk or danger to other road users.

48     The 1st Defendant had maintained that as he approached the bus stop, he had slowed down as he had been looking for a place to stop[^38] and that he had checked the rear-view and side mirrors and did not see the Plaintiff.[^39] When asked by counsel for the Plaintiff why he was not able to see the e-scooter,[^40] the 1st Defendant’s reply was that he would not have been able to see the Plaintiff if the Plaintiff had emerged from the bus bay at a fast speed.[^41] From this response, I infer that the 1st Defendant himself recognized that by stopping at such a short distance from the end of the bus bay, he had posed a risk to vehicles that might emerge from the bus bay, especially, if the vehicle had come out at a relatively high speed.

49     It is on this point that I find that the 1st Defendant had contributed to the accident. By stopping his car so near to the end of the bus bay, the 1st Defendant had acted in a manner that posed a danger to vehicles such as e-scooters and bicycles coming out from the bus bay because the 1st Defendant’s car would not have been visible to cyclists or e-scooter users coming out from the bus bay. If I accept the Defendants’ position that the Plaintiff was not in sight when the Defendants checked the rear view mirrors and side mirror respectively and that therefore the Plaintiff must have come out from the bus bay, then I would also have to conclude that the 1st Defendant had stopped his car in an unsafe manner.

50     The 1st Defendant has therefore contributed to the accident and is contributorily negligent.

### Whether the 2nd Defendant was negligent in opening the car door without ascertaining it was safe to do so

51     The Plaintiff’s case is that the 2nd Defendant had alighted and opened the front passenger door of the 1st Defendant’s vehicle so as to cause injury or danger to the Plaintiff, and that the 1st Defendant had allowed the 2nd Defendant to do so, and that both Defendants had failed to pay sufficient heed to the presence of the e-scooter.[^42]

52     It is clear that the 1st Defendant is responsible for the actions of his passengers. The 1st Defendant should have ensured that the 2nd Defendant open the car door only when it was safe to do so. Therefore, if the Plaintiff is able to establish that the 2nd Defendant had been negligent, then the 1st Defendant is also liable for the acts of the 2nd Defendant.

53     According to the 1st Defendant, he had taken about 2 to 3 seconds to check his mirrors and stopping his vehicle.[^43] He had conducted these checks before stopping his vehicle, but did not conduct these checks after stopping.[^44] The 1st Defendant had also agreed during cross-examination that it would take time for the outcome of his checks to register in his mind.[^45] Thereafter, after the 1st Defendant had stopped his vehicle, the 2nd Defendant then said “thank you” and “see you” before opening the front passenger door.[^46] In view of the above, a likely inference would be that the 1st Defendant’s vehicle had been signalling his intention to stop for around 2 to 3 seconds, and it would likely have taken the 2nd Defendant another 2 to 3 seconds to open the passenger door.

54     According to the 2nd Defendant, when the 1st Defendant’s vehicle stopped, she said thank you to the 1st Defendant, unbuckled the seatbelt, looked at the left side mirror to ensure that it was safe before opening the front passenger door.[^47] The 2nd Defendant estimated the time between the 1st Defendant stopping the car and the impact to be around 1 to 2 seconds.[^48]

55     Based on her own account, the 2nd Defendant had admitted that she had merely looked at the left side mirror before opening the door. The 2nd Defendant ought to have turned her head to her left to check for oncoming traffic including oncoming cyclists, e-scooter users, pedestrians etc coming from behind before opening the passenger door. She also ought to have opened the car door slowly while ascertaining that it was safe to open the door to alight. If the 2nd Defendant had taken these precautionary steps, the accident could have been avoided. It is hardly sufficient for her to just check the left view mirror. The left view mirror is not meant for the passenger but for the driver. In cross-examination, the 2nd Defendant agreed that if she had properly checked to her left, the accident would not have happened.[^49]

56     Further, it is imperative for the 1st Defendant to caution the 2nd Defendant to check for oncoming cyclists, e-scooter uers, motorcyclists and pedestrians before disembarking. In fact, the duty is on the 1st Defendant to let the 2nd Defendant know whether it was safe to disembark before she opened the car door. After stopping the car, the 1st Defendant ought to have looked at the rear view mirror and left mirror again as well as checked the blind spot on the left side of his car to ensure that it was safe for the 2nd Defendant to disembark before telling her to do so. If he had taken these steps, the accident could have been avoided.

57     I refer to the example shown at illustration 29 of the Motor Accident Guide 2nd Edition (page 88). The illustration shows a situation similar to that in the instant case, except that, instead of a rider of an e-scooter, it was a motorcyclist. In that example, it was reasoned that the driver or the passenger ought to have kept a lookout for oncoming vehicles and not obstruct or cause danger to passing or approaching vehicles. At the same time, the motorcyclist should not overtake the vehicle from the left by squeezing through the space between the kerb and the stationary vehicle. In that illustration, the apportionment of liability was 30:70.

58     I am of the opinion that the 1st Defendant in the instant case should bear a higher proportion of liability than the illustration in question as his act of stopping his car a short distance from the bus bay is a greater contributing factor towards causing the accident than the example in illustration 29. Further, I have also found that the 2nd Defendant had not checked to her left for oncoming traffic coming from behind before she opened the car door. Additionally, the 1st Defendant had failed to exercise due care in cautioning the 2nd Defendant and in ensuring that it was safe for the 2nd Defendant to alight from his car. Based on these factors, I will increase the Defendants’ liability by another 20% from the 30% shown in the illustration.

## Conclusion

59     In light of all of the above findings, I conclude that both parties are equally liable for causing the accident. In the circumstances, I will apportion liability between the parties at 50%-50%. Interlocutory judgment is hereby entered at 50% in favour of the Plaintiff, with costs to the Plaintiff and damages to be assessed by the Registrar. After hearing parties’ submissions on the issue of costs, I ordered costs to be fixed at $11,300 plus reasonable disbursements to be agreed or fixed by the Court plus gst as applicable.
