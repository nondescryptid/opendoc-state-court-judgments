\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9058/2019/01.\]

28 June 2019

### District Judge Brenda Tan:

## Background

1       This is an appeal by the accused, Tan Cheng Tien, a 46 year-old male Singaporean, against conviction and sentence.

2       Mr Tan claimed trial to one charge of Long Term 2 (LT-2) consumption of Methamphetamine, a specified drug, which is an offence under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33A(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). At the end of the trial, I found him guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. I sentenced him to an imprisonment term of 7 and a half years and also ordered that he be given 6 strokes of the cane. The sentence has been stayed pending Mr Tan’s appeal. He is currently out on bail.

## The Charge

3       The charge that Mr Tan claimed trial to read as follows:

> DAC-920351-2017 (exhibit C1A)

> You,

TAN CHENG TIEN

NRIC No.: XXX

MALE / 45 YEARS OLD

DATE OF BIRTH: 28 MAY 1972

SINGAPORE CITIZEN

> are charged that you, on or before 23 May 2017, in Singapore, did consume a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), to wit, Methamphetamine, without authorisation under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the said Act, and further,

> that you, before the commission of the said offence, on 9 May 2013, in Court 3 of the Subordinate Courts of the Republic of Singapore, were convicted of the offence of consumption of a specified drug (Morphine) under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and were punished under s 33A(1) of the said Act with a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, vide DAC43801/2012, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and you are now therefore liable to be punished under s 33A(2) of the said Act.

## Statement of Agreed Facts (exhibit PS1)

4       Pursuant to s 267 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed to admit certain undisputed facts that are set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts (exhibit PS1) as conclusive evidence for the purpose of the proceedings. The Statement of Agreed Facts is re-produced below:

> 1.    The accused is Tan Cheng Tien, a male Singaporean (NRIC No.: XXX), 45 years of age (D.O.B.: 28 May 1972).

> 2.    On 23 May 2017, at about 1.10 p.m., at Blk 743, Jurong West Street 73, #XXX, Singapore, the accused was arrested by a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) for suspected drug offences. At about 1.29 p.m., SSgt Riaz Mohamed Kamil of CNB lodged a report (J/20170523/2099) for the arrest.

> 3.    On the same day, at the CNB office located at the Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters situated at 2 Jurong West Ave 5, Singapore, the accused provided two bottles containing a specimen of his urine in accordance with the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) and the Regulations made thereunder. The bottles were both sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SJ-17-00419-1 TAN CHENG TIEN SXXX” and “C-SJ-17-00419-2 TAN CHENG TIEN SXXX”, respectively, in his presence. The accused deposited the samples into two tamper-proof locked security boxes (one sample per box).

> 4.    On 24 May 2017, the urine samples (contained in the locked security boxes) were submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”).

> 5.    Ng Chee Ann, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory (“ATL”) of HSA, having conducted the analysis of the urine sample marked “C-SJ-17-00419-1 TAN CHENG TIEN SXXX” pursuant to s 31(4)(b) of the MDA, issued a certificate (Lab No.: AT-1733-04499-001-03) dated 25 May 2017 under s 16 of the MDA, certifying that, on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

> 6.    Goh Mei ling Evelyn, an analyst with the ATL of HSA, having conducted the analysis of the urine sample marked “C-SJ-17-00419-2 TAN CHENG TIEN SXXX” pursuant to s 31(4)(b) of the MDA, issued a certificate (Lab No.: AT-1733-04499-002-03) dated 25 May 2017 under s 16 of the MDA, certifying that, on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain Methamphetamine.

> 7.    Hence, Methamphetamine was found in the accused’s urine as a result of urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(b) of the MDA.

> 8.    At all times, the accused was not authorised under MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to consume Methamphetamine, a Specified Drug listed under the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

> 9.    On 9 May 2013, in Court 3 of the Subordinate Courts of the Republic of Singapore, the accused was convicted of the offence of consumption of a specified drug (Morphine) under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed), and was punished under s 33A(1) of the said Act with a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, vide DAC43801/2012, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date.

> 10.    The fact of this conviction and the punishment is certified in the memorandum of certified previous convictions for the accused. A copy of this memorandum has been certified true by the Assistant Registrar of Criminals, Singapore.

## Issue before the Court

5       Under s 22 of the MDA, if any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under s 31(4)(b) of the MDA, the person shall be presumed, until the contrary was proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of s 8(b). Methamphetamine (commonly known as ice) is both a controlled drug and a specified drug under the MDA. Since Mr Tan accepted that his urine samples tested positive for Methamphetamine as a result of the tests conducted pursuant to s 31(4)(b) of the MDA (see \[7\] of the Statement of Agreed Facts above), he was presumed to have consumed it knowingly.

6       The Defence conceded that there was a prima facie case made out against Mr Tan on the basis of the Statement of Agreed Facts and hence Mr Tan had a case to answer. Therefore, the Court called upon Mr Tan to enter his defence and he elected to give evidence. His defence was that he did not consume any illicit drugs knowingly. He had simply consumed sex enhancement pills. The issue before the court was therefore whether Mr Tan had rebutted the presumption on a balance of probabilities that he had knowingly consumed Methamphetamine.

## Case for the Defence

7       Mr Tan was the only witness for the Defence. At the time of his testimony, he was working as a pub operator. He told the Court that he had stayed away from drugs since his release from prison on 10 Oct 2016. He believed that his urine had tested positive for Methamphetamine because he had consumed sex enhancement pills which were either given to him by his late friend Chor Hwee[^1] or which he himself had purchased. Mr Tan narrated that he met Chor Hwee, Eng Keat and Chee Keong in prison and they became friends. Whilst in prison, Mr Tan confided in Chee Keong, whom he was closer to, regarding his premature ejaculation problem.

8       Mr Tan was the last person amongst the four friends to be released from prison. Sometime in Oct or Nov 2016, the four friends met up at a coffee shop in Geylang Lorong 25 at about 5pm. They consumed some alcohol and talked about looking for prostitutes. They then moved to another coffee shop at Lorong 12 Geylang where there were more prostitutes. They reached the second coffee shop at about 7pm and continued to consume alcohol. Halfway during their drinking session, Chor Hwee left and returned 10 to 15 minutes later and took out a packet of “drugs” containing pills which were longish in shape like bullets. Some pills were white in colour and some were yellow in colour. Chor Hwee said that the pills would help to prolong sexual intercourse and offered the pills to them. Mr Tan asked Chor Hwee whether consuming the pill would harm one’s health and cause one’s urine to test positive for drugs. Chor Hwee assured Mr Tan that he had consumed the pill before and the pill was neither harmful nor did it result in positive urine analysis.

9       Mr Tan decided to give the sex enhancement pills a try and found that he was able to extend his sexual intercourse by another half an hour to 45 minutes when previously it did not last beyond 5 minutes. Thus that same night, he asked Chor Hwee where he had purchased the pills and Chor Hwee told him that he had bought them at Geylang Lorong 23 and 24. Chor Hwee still had a few pills left and he gave them all to Mr Tan. Mr Tan kept the pills from Chor Hwee in his bedroom cupboard drawer.

10     Mr Tan told the court that he would also buy his own sex enhancement pills when he visited prostitutes in Geylang. He would buy two to three pills, consume one and keep the rest in the same drawer where he kept the ones from Chor Hwee. He did not encounter any problems when he reported for urine testing after consuming the sex enhancement pills. He maintained that he had not touched drugs since his release from his 5 year LT-1 imprisonment term because he was terrified of going back to jail and had been dutifully going for his urine tests. His parents were also getting on in years and his father had warned him to stop fooling around as he might not have many more years left. Thus Mr Tan failed to understand why his urine tested positive for Methamphetamine upon his arrest on 23 May 2017. He had merely consumed sex enhancement pills prior to sexual intercourse on 2 recent occasions before his arrest. One occasion was on the night before his arrest and the other occasion was a few days before his arrest.

11     When Mr Tan informed the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers that it was the sex enhancement pills that had caused his urine to test positive for Methamphetamine, CNB told him to produce the pills for examination. It happened that Mr Tan had consumed his last sex enhancement pill the day before his arrest so he went to Geylang Lorong 23 and 24 to buy more sex enhancement pills and surrendered them to CNB on 7 Feb 2018.

12     Mr Tan surrendered a total of 5 sex enhancement pills to CNB (see exhibit D10). The 5 pills were in turn submitted to HSA for analysis. 2 of them were analysed and found to contain Methamphetamine (see exhibits D6 and D7). No controlled drugs were detected in the other 3 pills (see exhibit D5, D8 and D9). Hence the Defence submitted that the HSA results proved that Mr Tan had unknowingly consumed Methamphetamine when he thought he was consuming sex enhancement pill.

13     The Defence also admitted in evidence 4 statements given by Mr Tan to CNB to show that he had been consistent in his accounts (see exhibits D1 to D4).

## Evaluation of the evidence and findings

#### Whether Mr Tan was a credible witness

14     I was of the view that Mr Tan was not a credible witness because there were material inconsistencies in his evidence as follows:

> _Evidence relating to when Mr Tan last consumed sex enhancement pills_

> (i)     Mr Tan had reported for his routine urine testing on 22 May 2017 (see exhibit P6) where his urine was found to be clear of controlled drugs. That night he visited a prostitute and consumed a sex enhancement pill. The next day he was arrested during a spot check and his urine tests yielded incriminating results. It was glaring that he failed to mention specifically in his statement (exhibit D1) which was recorded on the day of his arrest on 23 May 2017 that he had consumed a sex enhancement pill just the night before. He merely stated generally that he had been consuming medications which he obtained from polyclinics and private clinics as well as illegal sex pills which he had obtained from illegal sources from Lorong 22-24 Geylang[^2]. He totally omitted to tell the recording officer that after his urine tested negative earlier in the day, he had taken a sex enhancement pill that night which resulted in his urine testing positive during the spot check the next afternoon. He similarly failed to disclose this crucial piece of evidence on 16 June 2017 in his further statement (exhibit D2) when he was shown the HSA certificates confirming that his urine samples tested positive for Methamphetamine. Again he repeated his broad defence that he had only consumed medications and illegal sex pills but not controlled drugs[^3]. Likewise, in his cautioned statement recorded later that afternoon on 16 June 2017 (see exhibit D3), he simply declared that he “_did not smoke ice_” and “_only eat sex pills that was bought from Geylang_”. He completely left out the vital detail that he just had sex on 22 May 2017 and even “_a few days earlier_” and had consumed sex enhancement pills[^4].

> (ii)     It would be noted that Mr Tan took more than half a year before he finally revealed that he had consumed sex enhancement pill one day before his arrest. For the first time, it was mentioned in the Case for The Defence which was filed on 11 Dec 2017 (exhibit P7) at \[13\] that he “_had consumed the sexual enhancement drugs on Monday night, 22nd May 2017 as he wanted to gratify his Thai girlfriend through lengthy sexual intercourse_.”

> (iii)     It would further be noted that the first time that Mr Tan disclosed that he had consumed sex enhancement pill about “_2 to 3 days_” before his arrest was in his long statement dated 7 Feb 2018 (see \[8\] and \[10\] of exhibit D4) when he went to CNB to surrender the 5 pills which he specially bought from Geylang for the purpose of submitting them to HSA for analysis. Interestingly, Mr Tan did not state in D4 that he had also consumed sex enhancement pill on 22 May 2017, the night before his arrest. I agreed with the Prosecution that Mr Tan had implicitly suggested in D4 that the only occasion when he purportedly consumed sex enhancement pill before his arrest was the occasion over the weekend on either Sat or Sun[^5]. It was during his oral testimony in court that Mr Tan combined both versions and told the court that he had consumed sex enhancement pills on 22 May 2017 as well as “_a few days earlier_”[^6] or “_2 or 3 days_” earlier.

> _Evidence relating to which sex enhancement pill Mr Tan last consumed_

> (iv)     The 5 pills that Mr Tan surrendered to CNB consisted of 2 types, either yellow pills or white pills. Mr Tan submitted 3 yellow pills and 2 white pills. 2 of the yellow pills were found to contain Methamphetamine[^7]. The remaining 3 pills did not contain any controlled drugs[^8]. When Mr Tan surrendered the 5 pills to CNB on 7 Feb 2018, he stated in D4 at \[8\] that they were “_similar_” to the ones which he had consumed about 2 to 3 days before his arrest. At \[9\], he stated that he bought them from a different supplier as he was unable to locate the previous supplier that he had purchased his stock from. At \[10\], he stated that he was unable to go to Chor Hwee’s supplier because he did not ask the late Chor Hwee where he bought them from. At \[11\] of D4, Mr Tan also stated that he “_cannot remember exactly which types of capsules_” he had consumed. During the trial, Mr Tan insisted that what he had consumed on the last 2 occasions before his arrest were the same pills as what Chor Hwee gave him and what he himself had bought. He only could not recall which colour pill he took. Mr Tan was obviously waffling in his evidence. I also agreed with the Prosecution that Mr Tan not only contradicted himself in this regard but he also “_had no basis to assert his certainty that what he had surrendered was indeed what he purportedly consumed_”[^9].

> _Number of occasions on which Chor Hwee gave Mr Tan sex enhancement pills_

> (v)     I agreed with the Prosecution that Mr Tan gave different accounts regarding the number of occasions on which Chor Hwee supposedly gave him sex enhancement pills. During his cross-examination, he told the court that there was only one occasion in either Oct or Nov 2016 where Chor Hwee gave him sex enhancement pills[^10]. However, in D4, his further statement recorded on 7 Feb 2018 when he went to CNB to submit the 5 sex enhancement pills for analysis, he stated at \[11\] that prior to his arrest on 23 May 2017, he had consumed sex enhancement pills for more than 10 times and “_\[m\]ost of the times, the illicit sex pills where \[sic\] given to me by ‘Chor Hwee’”._ At \[10\] of D4, Mr Tan also stated that he “_last took some sex enhancement pills from ‘Chor Hwee’ in March or April before he committed suicide_”. Mr Tan was distinctly changing his story on the number of instances that Chor Hwee had given him sex enhancement pills. I would add that I also agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that Mr Tan’s explanation for the discrepancies was not convincing[^11].

> It was also noteworthy that Chor Hwee did not feature in Mr Tan’s earlier statements to CNB (see exhibits D1, D2 and D3). In fact, in D1 at \[5\] and D2 at \[9\], he stated that he had consumed illegal sex pills which he himself had bought from Geylang. The first time that Chor Hwee’s name came up was when Mr Tan filed his Case for the Defence on 11 Dec 2017 (exhibit P7).

> _Number of suppliers who sold the pills that Mr Tan surrendered to CNB on 7 Feb 2018_

> (vi)     I agreed with the Prosecution’s submissions that Mr Tan gave conflicting versions with regards to the number of suppliers who sold him the pills which he surrendered to CNB on 7 Feb 2018. In court, he testified that he bought all 5 pills from “_one store_” however in D4 at \[9\], he stated that he bought the “_3 yellow capsules from one supplier for $15 and the other 2 white capsules from another supplier for $15 as well_”. In this regard, I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions at \[41\] to \[47\] of its Closing Submissions at pages 15 to 17.

> In the light of the above material inconsistencies in Mr Tan’s evidence, his defence that his urine tested positive for Methamphetamine due to sex enhancement pills that he had consumed was thus highly doubtful and would appear to be an afterthought.

#### Weight to be attached to the fact that 2 out of 5 sex enhancement pills submitted to HSA tested positive for Methamphetamine

15     I gave little or no weight to this fact because Mr Tan had bought these pills from a different source and he also did not know who Chor Hwee’s supplier was. Besides, as I have set out at \[14(iv)\] above at pages 7 and 8, Mr Tan had been inconsistent with regards to which type of sex enhancement pill he last consumed and his evidence was therefore unreliable.

#### Significance of Mr Tan’s regular absences from his routine urine tests

16     Mr Tan was placed on 24 months’ drug supervision from sometime in Oct 2016. He was required to report for urine testing twice a week on Monday and Friday except when it was a public holiday. It was not disputed that Mr Tan had not been reporting regularly for his routine urine tests as evident from his attendance records in exhibit P6. For the period 23 January 2017 to 26 May 2017, he only reported for urine testing on 12 occasions out of 33 occasions. He had medical certificates for the remaining 21 occasions. Mr Tan admitted that he had taken medical leave not only when he was truly sick but also when he felt it was inconvenient. The Prosecution submitted that his absences were consistent with his relapse to drug abuse. While I would not go so far as to draw such an inference, Mr Tan’s casual attitude towards urine reporting was certainly at odds with his claim that he had been dutifully reporting for urine tests out of fear of being jailed again. His malingering clearly did not gel with the new clean image he tried to paint of himself.

#### Mr Tan’s assertion that he was only a heroin abuser and would not consume “ice”

17     Mr Tan told the court that he only abused heroin and was not interested in dealing with ice/Methamphetamine. The Defence also submitted that Mr Tan’s previous incarcerations were for consumption of heroin and given that Mr Tan was addicted to “_opioid painkillers, it was therefore unlikely for him to have ventured into consuming Methamphetamine which is a stimulant drug_”[^12]. In my view, it was at most a neutral fact that Mr Tan had thus far only abused heroin. It did not necessarily mean that Mr Tan would not experiment with ice.

#### Failure of the Defence in producing Tham Chee Keong as a witness despite its earlier indications that Tham Chee Keong would be testifying

18     For completeness, I shall deal with the failure by the Defence to call Tham Chee Keong as a witness. The Defence had initially told the court that Tham Chee Keong would be testifying for the Defence but eventually it decided not to call him as a witness because Tham Chee Keong suddenly declined to attend court for his own “complex personal reasons”[^13]. If Tham Chee Keong had come forward as a Defence witness, his evidence would probably be to corroborate Mr Tan’s account about his premature ejaculation problem and possibly about them meeting up at Geylang. It would be noted that Mr Tan did not adduce any medical evidence to support his claim that he suffered from premature ejaculation. I therefore did not think that Tham Chee Keong’s evidence would have assisted in furthering the Defence’s case. Hence it was not necessary to draw any adverse inference from his non-appearance in court.

## Defence had failed to rebut the presumption on a balance of probabilities

19     In conclusion, I did not find Mr Tan to be a credible witness and I disbelieved his story. On the totality of the evidence, the Defence had failed to rebut the presumption that Mr Tan had consumed Methamphetamine knowingly. I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case against Mr Tan beyond a reasonable doubt. As such I found Mr Tan guilty as charged and I convicted him accordingly.

## Antecedents

20     Mr Tan had numerous antecedents starting from 1991. Aside from drug antecedents, Mr Tan’s antecedents also included property offences, traffic offences and offences related to unlicensed moneylending. His relevant drug antecedents were as follows:

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

21     This is Mr Tan’s first conviction for a LT-2 offence which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution submitted for an uplift of 6 months above the mandatory minimum sentence and in support of its position, cited the High Court decision of _Nandakishor s/o Raj Pat Ahir v PP <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 121</span>_. In that case, the appellant had claimed trial. Justice Tay Yong Kwang (as he then was), having regard to the appellant’s drug-related antecedents and in the absence of mitigating factors, held that the District Court’s decision to sentence the accused to an additional 6 months’ imprisonment above the mandatory minimum sentence could hardly be said to be manifestly excessive.

## Mitigation

22     In mitigation, the Defence stated that Mr Tan was separated from his wife with whom he had 2 children aged 16 and 21. He had a Singaporean girlfriend and he was intending to settle down with her. His father was 78 years old and suffered from old age ailments while his mother who was 66 years old suffered from high blood pressure. His highest educational level was that of Primary 6. He had stopped his studies to work to support himself and his family. He served as a cook during his National Service and achieved the rank of Lance Corporal. Prior to his arrest, he was assisting his sister at her food stall and earned $80 a day.

## Sentencing Considerations

23     Deterrence was clearly the primary sentencing consideration. Mr Tan’s drug-related antecedents dated back to 1996. He had also not shown remorse and there was no real mitigating factor in his favour. I was therefore of the view that that an uplift of 6 months above the mandatory minimum sentence would be appropriate and accordingly I sentenced Mr Tan to 7 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and the minimum 6 strokes of the cane.
