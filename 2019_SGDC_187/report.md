2       Upon his conviction, the accused person admitted to the remaining 14 charges and consented for them to be taken into consideration(TIC) for the purpose of sentencing. The 14 charges comprise 2 counts of consumption of specified drugs (LT2), 4 counts of possession of drugs, 1 count of having drug taking utensils, 2 counts of failure to report for urine tests and 5 counts of cheating.

3       The accused was sentenced to serve a total of 7 years and 20 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane. He is now appealing against his sentence.

## Statement of Facts (SOF)

4       The SOF which the accused admitted without any qualification disclosed the following material facts:

5       The accused is Shanker S/O Sabapathy, a 44-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, the accused was employed as a fork lift driver.

#### Facts relating to the 1st Charge – DAC-916390-2018

6       On 3 March 2018, at about 2.10 p.m., a team of Police officers arrested the accused at No. 8 Lorong 10 Geylang, Super 8 Hotel, Room 403, Singapore, on suspicion of having committed drug offences. The accused was subsequently brought back to Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters for further investigations.

7       On 3 March 2018, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples, which were sealed in his presence. These urine samples were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 5 March 2018. On 6 March 2018, Ng Chee Ann and Maggie Tiong Su Su, analysts with the analytical toxicology laboratory of the HSA, issued certificates stating that upon analysis, the urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine.

8       Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed under the MDA. The accused’s urine contained methamphetamine as a result of his consumption of methamphetamine which he is not authorised to consume. He has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA.

9       Prior to the commission of this offence, the accused was on 29 January 2014, convicted of an offence for the consumption of methamphetamine, under Section 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA and punished under Section 33A(1) of the MDA with 5 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction has not been set aside and he is now liable for enhanced punishment under Section 33A(2) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to the 5th charge – DAC-934963-2018

10     On 8 May 2018, at about 10.50 p.m., a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) arrested the accused at 393F Upper Changi Road, Cameron Hotel, Singapore, on suspicion of having committed drug offences.

11     Subsequently, the CNB officers recovered, _inter alia_, the following drug exhibits from Room 32 of the Cameron Hotel, and the glove compartment and center console compartment of the car bearing vehicle registration number SLA8363C, which was parked at the lobby of the Cameron Hotel:

> a)     One packet of crystalline substance (subsequently marked as “D1”);

> b)     One packet of crystalline substance (subsequently marked as “E1”); and

> c)     One packet of crystalline substance (subsequently marked as “F1A”).

12     On 10 May 2018, the above exhibits were sent to the HSA for analysis. On 6 June 2018, Teo Hui Ping, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory (“IDL”) of the HSA, issued three certificates stating that the said exhibits were found to be three packets containing not less than 7.48g of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 5.02g of methamphetamine. The accused admitted to possession and ownership of the said exhibits which he intended to consume. Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug listed under the MDA which he is not authorised to possess. He has thereby committed an offence under Section 8(_a_) of the MDA.

13     Prior to the commission of this offence, the accused was on 22 December 2004, convicted of an offence for the possession of diamorphine, under Section 8(_a_) of the MDA and punished under Section 33(1) of the MDA with 12 months’ imprisonment, which conviction has not been set aside to date, and he shall now be liable for enhanced punishment under Section 33(1) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to the 12th charge – DAC-934970-2018

14     On 15 November 2017, the accused was placed under compulsory supervision by virtue of Regulation 15(3)(_f_) to the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Rg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (“MDR”). Pursuant to Regulation 15(3)(_f_) of the MDR, he was required to present himself at Tanglin Police every Monday and Friday of each month, commencing on 15 December 2017, for urine tests during the period of supervision, from 12 December 2017 to 11 December 2019.

15     The accused failed to present himself for a urine test on 7 May 2018, Monday, at Tanglin Police without any valid reason. Investigations revealed that the accused had failed to report for his urine tests since 26 January 2018. He did not have any valid reason for failing to report for his urine tests. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Regulation 15(6)(_a_) of the MDR.

#### Facts relating to the 14th charge – DAC-915640-2019

16     The victim is Tan Hock Heng (“Tan”), a 57-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was working as an appraiser for Valuemax Pawnshop Pte Ltd, located at Blk 218 Bedok North Street 1, #01-31, Singapore.

17     The involved parties are:

> a)     Junitha Nirmala D/O Gunasegaran (“Junitha”), a 27-year-old female Singaporean and

> b)     Daniel Raj Asirvatham S/O Joshua (“Daniel”), a 29-year-old male Singaporean.

18     The accused and Daniel are old friends. Sometime in February 2018, the accused called Daniel for a meeting. During the meeting, the accused informed Daniel that he was pawning fake gold jewellery at various pawnshops in Singapore. The accused offered to pay Daniel S$100 for each pawning transaction. The accused assured Daniel that the fake jewellery could be used to cheat the pawnshops, and told him to find female persons to pawn the fake gold jewellery as it would be less suspicious. Daniel accepted the accused’s offer.

19     Daniel subsequently contacted Junitha, who was an old friend. Daniel queried Junitha on whether she was agreeable to pawning fake jewellery. Junitha agreed to this arrangement.

20     On 1 March 2018, Shanker met Daniel and handed him 4 golden bangles bearing the mark 916. The 4 bangles were not made of real 22 carat gold. He procured them from a source in Malaysia with the sole purpose of cheating pawnshops. Daniel subsequently handed the 4 bangles to Junitha, and instructed her to pawn them.

21     On 1 March 2018, at about 3.33 p.m., Junitha entered the Valuemax pawnshop and presented the 4 bangles to Tan and requested to pawn them. Junitha intended to deceive Tan into believing that the 4 gold bangles were made of gold, a fact which she knew was false. Tan performed a check of the bangles, and valued them at S$3,350 on the basis that they were made of real 22 carat gold. Junitha then received S$3,350 from Tan in exchange for the 4 bangles. Junitha handed over the S$3,350 received from Tan to the accused.

22     The accused entered into a conspiracy with Junitha and Daniel to deceive Tan, and by such deception, dishonestly induced Tan to deliver S$3,350 to Junitha, which Tan would not have done had he not been deceived.

23     Tan subsequently discovered that the 4 bangles were not made of real gold when he sent them to the Value Max headquarters for further testing. The accused has thereby committed one count of an offence under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code.

#### Facts relating to the 15th charge – DAC-915641-2019

24     The victim is Ng Boon Meng (“Ng”), a 69-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was working as a pawnshop assistant for Thai Hong Pawnshop Pte Ltd, located at Blk 72 Lorong 5 Toa Payoh #01-580, Singapore (“the Pawnshop”).

25     The involved parties are:

> a)     Alvina Cassandra Poovaneswari D/O Nagendran (“Alvina”), a 28-year-old female Singaporean bearing NRIC No.: XXX; and

> b)     Daniel.

26     Alvina is Daniel’s wife. Sometime in late February 2018, Daniel informed Alvina that Shanker had asked for his help pawning some fake gold jewellery. Daniel then requested for Alvina’s assistance in pawning the jewellery.

27     On 8 March 2018, Daniel, Alvina and Shanker met. Pursuant to the agreement between Daniel and Shanker stated at \[18\] above, Shanker handed over one gold necklace to Alvina in Daniel’s presence. The gold necklace bore the mark 916, but was not made of real 22 carat gold. Shanker procured the gold necklace from a source in Malaysia with the sole purpose of cheating pawnshops.

28     On 8 March 2018, at about 3.11 p.m., Alvina entered the Thai Hong pawnshop and presented the gold necklace to Ng requesting to pawn it. Ng performed a check of the necklace, and valued the necklace at S$3,500 on the basis that it was made of real 22 carat gold. Alvina then received S$3,500 from Ng in exchange for the necklace.

29     The accused entered into a conspiracy with Alvina and Daniel to deceive Ng, and by such deception, dishonestly induced Ng to deliver S$3,500 to Alvina, which Ng would not have done had he not been deceived.

30     Ng subsequently discovered that the gold necklace was not made of real gold when he sent it to Value Max for sale. It was discovered that the necklace was plated with real gold, but had a non-gold interior. The accused has thereby committed one count of an offence under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code.

#### Facts relating to the 20th charge – DAC-915646-2019

31     The victim is Ong Ley Kuan (“Ong”), a 60-year-old female Singaporean. At the material time, she was working as a valuer for Fook Thai Pawnshop Pte Ltd, located at Blk 116 Toa Payoh Lor 2, #01-148, Singapore.

32     The involved parties are Alvina and Daniel.

33     On 8 March 2018, Daniel, Alvina and Shanker met up. After committing the offence stated at \[29\] above, Shanker decided to pawn another gold necklace at another pawnshop. Pursuant to the agreement between Daniel and Shanker stated at \[18\] above, Shanker handed over one gold necklace to Alvina in Daniel’s presence. The gold necklace bore the mark 916, but was not made of real 22 carat gold. Shanker procured the gold necklace from a source in Malaysia with the sole purpose of cheating pawnshops.

34     On 8 March 2018, Alvina entered the Fook Thai pawnshop and presented the gold necklace to Ong requesting to pawn it. Ong performed a check of the necklace, and valued the necklace at S$3,150 on the basis that it was made of real 22 carat gold. Alvina then received S$3,150 from Ong in exchange for the necklace.

35     The accused entered into a conspiracy with Alvina and Daniel to deceive Ong, and by such deception, dishonestly induced Ong to deliver S$3,150 to Alvina, which Ong would not have done had she not been deceived. It was subsequently discovered that the necklace was not made of real gold.

36     The accused has thereby committed one count of an offence under Section 420 read with Section 109 of the Penal Code. The accused admitted that he committed the various cheating offences as he needed the money to fuel his drug habit. To date, the accused has not made any restitution.

#### Co-Accused Sentence

37     On 18 July 2019, Daniel pleaded guilty to 3 charges under Section 420 r/w Section 109 of the Penal Code, in relation to his involvement in the offences listed at \[16\] – \[36\] above. One other charge under Section 420 r/w Section 109 of the Penal Code was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

38     Daniel was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment per charge, with an aggregate global sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. Prior to committing the abovementioned offences, Daniel had no criminal antecedents.

## The Antecedents

39     The prosecution disclosed that the accused has the following antecedents under the MDA:

41     The accused has been convicted of 3 charges under the MDA and its regulations. The first charge is consumption of a specified drug, namely, methamphetamine, an LT2 charge, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane and the maximum is 13 years’ imprisonment and 13 strokes of the cane. The other charge is possession of methamphetamine, a Class A controlled drug and the prescribed punishment is a mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment and the maximum is 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine up to $20,000 or both since the accused is a repeat offender for this offence. The third charge is for having failed to report for a urine test which is punishable with imprisonment up to 4 years or $10,000 fine or both. In addition, he has been convicted of 3 charges of cheating by conspiracy under section 420 read with section 109 under the Penal Code which is punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years and also liable to a fine.

42     The prosecution, in their written address on sentence, citing a number of aggravating factors sought a global sentence of at least 8 years and 8 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. For the individual sentences they submitted for a term of 7 years and 3 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane for the LT2 charge, 2 years’ imprisonment for the possession charge, 9 months’ imprisonment for failing to report for the urine test charge and 8 months’ imprisonment for each of the cheating by conspiracy charges. They further submitted for the terms of imprisonment for the LT2 charge, the failing to report for urine test and one of the cheating by conspiracy charges to run consecutively.

43     In mitigation, counsel for the accused described him as deeply remorseful and said that he had pleaded guilty at an early stage of the proceedings. In respect of the 3 drug offences they argued for a total sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment submitting that all the offences are drug related under the MDA. Where the cheating charges were concerned the defence submitted that the accused should receive the same sentence as his co-accused, Daniel, which is 6 months’ imprisonment and with both terms to run consecutively together with the term of imprisonment of 7 years’ imprisonment for the LT2 charge, this will result in a total sentence of 8 years’ imprisonment. They were of the view that such a sentence should be sufficient.

44     Considering that there are mandatory minimum sentences for the offence of LT2, consumption of specified drugs, which is the most serious charge the accused is facing, as it involves a substantial period of imprisonment plus caning, there can be no doubt that the law takes a serious view of such offences. Drug activities are regarded as a dreaded scourge and the predominant interest is the protection of society from the menace and social evils associated with drug abuse. Deterrence therefore takes centre stage in determining the appropriate sentence for offences under the MDA. With these considerations in mind, I turn to the facts of this case.

45     In respect of the LT2 offence, I am inclined to agree with the prosecution that there should be an uplift of 3 months from the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment in view of the aggravating factors they highlighted, which appeared to be unchallenged by the defence. First and foremost was the fact, that the accused was first arrested on the 3 of March 2018 and released on station bail shortly thereafter. Despite being fully aware that he was under investigation, the accused went on to commit another 11 offences under the MDA between 30 April 2018 and the 8 May 2018. Committing offences while on bail, even station bail, is definitely an aggravating factor. (See PP _v Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR 753</span> and _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGHC 217</span>). By so doing, the accused displayed a defiant attitude and demonstrated a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention. It puts a lie to his claim that he was remorseful.

46     Where the 11 other MDA offences, committed on station bail were concerned, 2 of them were drug consumption charges of the LT2 nature and these were TIC for the purpose of sentencing. Its trite law that the approach the courts should adopt if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offence proceeded with would be increased.

47     Based on his record of antecedents, the accused last appeared in court on the 29 January 2014, and he was released on the 12 December 2017 when the drug supervision order was made. He was arrested on the 3 March 2018 when he committed the proceeded LT2 offence. This was almost 3 months after his release from prison. The fact that the accused had re-offended extremely soon after his last stint in prison was an aggravating factor which I could not ignore. Obviously, the total sentence of 5 years’ and 6 months’ imprisonment that was imposed on him with the mandatory minimum 3 strokes of the cane on 29 January 2014 did not have the desired and deterrent effect on him.

48     In respect of the drug possession charge of methamphetamine, since I had imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment, I can only presume that the accused is not dissatisfied with this sentence. There was no increase from the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years inspite of the fact that there were 4 other charges which were TIC. Not only were all the 5 possession offences committed by the accused while he was on bail but they involved 4 different type of drugs.

49     In respect of the charge concerning his failure to report for a urine test, I note that this was not the first time the accused had committed such an offence, as he had 2 previous similar convictions. The first was in 2010 when he was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment on 1 charge with 2 other similar charges TIC. The next was in 2014 when again he was sentenced to a 6 month’ imprisonment on each charge (2 were proceeded) with 2 other similar charges TIC. While he has now pleaded guilty to 1 charge, there were 2 other similar charges which had been TIC with his consent. He did not offer any reason why he had not complied with the order to submit himself for urine tests. The prosecution sought a sentence of imprisonment of 9 months on the ground that it was necessary to give effect to the principle of specific deterrence. I agree. Bearing in mind that this was the third time he was being convicted of such offences which he committed while on bail, there should be an escalation in the sentence and 9 months’ imprisonment was not unduly harsh.

50     With regard to the sentence for the 3 cheating by conspiracy charges, the prosecution and the defence did not appear to be far apart. The prosecution submitted for 8 months’ imprisonment per charge while the defence submitted for 6 months’ imprisonment, which was the sentence imposed on the co-accused, Daniel. I agree with the prosecution that the accused and Daniel should not be treated in the same manner as their culpability was materially different in that the accused’s was significantly higher.

51     First and foremost was the fact that the accused was the mastermind of the scam to pawn fake gold jewellery at various pawnshops in Singapore. He distanced himself from doing the actual pawning by recruiting Daniel whom he called for a meeting, and offered him $100 for each pawning transaction. He directed Daniel to find female persons to pawn the fake gold jewellery as he was astute enough to realise that it would be less suspicious to the pawnshops. He procured the fake gold from Malaysia with the sole purpose of cheating the pawnshops. Each pawning transaction resulted in the accused obtaining the lion’s share of the profits, since for each transaction (inclusive of TIC charges) the amount each pawnshop paid was between $3,000 to $3,500 and Daniel was given a pittance of only $100. The accused and Daniel were definitely far from being equal partners in this enterprise.

52     Secondly, Daniel only faced 4 cheating charges while the accused faced 8 cheating charges. The total amount involved for these 8 charges where he cheated various pawnshops was S$24,800 compared to Daniels’s sum of $12,800. Without a doubt, the accused has caused greater harm than Daniel. I was hence not persuaded by the defence’s mitigation that the accused should receive the same sentence as Daniel for the cheating charges as based on their specific circumstances, the accused deserve a higher sentence. Further, while Daniel did make some restitution, the accused did not make any which demonstrated his lack of remorse. Daniel was also a first offender in comparison to the accused who has previous property antecedents but which I accept are rather dated. An uplift of a mere 2 months from Daniel’s sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment for each charge to 8 months for this accused was not unduly excessive.

53     The next issue to be considered would be the terms of imprisonment which should be ordered to run consecutively. While I am mindful that at the very minimum, only 2 terms of imprisonment needed to be ordered to run consecutively as long as the aggregate sentence exceeds the longest term and the one transaction rule is not infringed, I was of the view that making 3 terms of imprisonment run consecutively would be appropriate. It bears emphasis to reiterate that this accused faced a total of 20 offences, which he committed fairly soon after his release from prison and except for 2 offences the rest were committed while he was on bail. The first 12 charges were offences under the MDA and the last 8 were cheating by conspiracy charges. It would not be right to only allow the sentence for the LT2 charge to run consecutively with one of the sentences for the cheating charges. In the first place, in respect of the charges under the MDA the accused has been convicted of a consumption charge, an enhanced possession charge and a failure to report for urine test charge. All these charges involve the invasion of separate and distinct legally protected interests. They were committed on different dates and in different places.

54     I was incline to run the sentence of 9 months’ imprisonment for the failure to report for urine test charge together with the term of imprisonment for the LT2 charge. To make only the term of imprisonment for the LT2 offence from the MDA series of offences to run consecutively with the term of imprisonment for cheating by conspiracy charge would result in the accused not receiving any punishment for the 11 other MDA offences which he committed while on bail on different dates. Therefore, taking into account the accused’s overall criminality, his age, future prospects and his past records, 3 terms of imprisonment running consecutively would not offend the totality principle and the one transaction rule. The resulting sentence of 7 years’ and 20 months’ imprisonment cannot be described as crushing given that he has served in total since 2004, 16 years and being subjected to 14 strokes of the cane, which obviously did not have any deterrent effect on him.

55     All considered, taking into account all the relevant factors including the plea in mitigation, I passed the following sentences on the accused

56     The total sentence of the accused is therefore 7 years’ and 20 months’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane, with effect from 10 May 2018, as the accused has been in remand since this date. He is currently serving his sentence.
