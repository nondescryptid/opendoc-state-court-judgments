12 July 2019

### District Judge Tan Jen Tse:

## INTRODUCTION

1       The accused pleaded guilty to one charge punishable under s 338(b) of the Penal Code (“s 338(b)”). The charge read:-

> **MAC-900954-2019 (1ST Charge)**

> … \[o\]n 25th June 2018, at or about 12.33 pm, at the non-signalized ‘T’ junction of Sin Ming Plaza Exit and Shunfu Road, Singapore, being the driver of motorcar SLM6063T, did cause grievous hurt to a pillion rider, namely one Noraniah Binte Asharih, female 69 years old, by doing an act so negligent as to endanger human life, _to wit_, by failing to keep a proper lookout while making a right turn from Sin Ming Plaza Exit into Shunfu Road, and thereby resulting in a collision with a motorcycle bearing registration no. FBE2464G, which had the right of way, which was travelling from your right to your left along Shunfu Road, and thereby causing the said Noraniah Binte Asharih to suffer the following injuries:

>> a)    Multiple abrasions over left knee and superficial linear abrasion over left anterior calf;

>> b)    Minimally displaced fracture of proximal tibia and fibula neck with extension to posterior aspect of lateral tibial plateau;

>> c)    Lipohaemarthrosis and associated degenerative changes in left knee joint;

>> d)    Schatzker type 6 lateral tibia plateau fracture left;

>> e)    Proximal fibula fracture; and

>> f)    Advanced tricompartmental osteoarthritis of left knee joint,

> and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 338 (b) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

2       One further offence relating to negligently causing hurt to the rider of the said motorcycle punishable under s 337(b) of the Penal Code (“s 337(b)”) was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

3       The accused was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or in default to 2 weeks’ imprisonment and disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for all classes of motor vehicles (“disqualification”) for 12 months. The prosecution (which sought a short detention order (“SDO”) of 7 days and disqualification of 18 months) has appealed against sentence. The defence (which sought an order of probation) has also appealed against sentence. The fine has been paid and no application to stay disqualification has been made.

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

4       The accused admitted to the following Statement of Facts (“SOF”):-

**STATEMENT OF FACTS (amended)**

> 1    The accused is Wah Zhee Ron, Johann, a 20-year-old Singaporean male, bearing NRIC No.: Sxxx (D.O.B.: 22 September 1998). At the material time, the accused was the driver of a motor car bearing registration number SLM6063T (the “Car”).

> 2    The victim is Noraniah Binte Asharih, a 69-year-old female Singaporean. At the material time, the victim was the pillion rider of the motorcycle bearing registration number FBE2464G (the “Motorcycle”).

> 3    The witness is Ishar Bin Idris, a 70-year-old male Singaporean. The witness is the rider of the Motorcycle and the husband of the victim.

> **FACTS PERTAINING TO THE CHARGE**

> 4    On 25 June 2018, at or about 12.33pm, the accused was driving the Car out from Sin Ming Plaza exit, intending to turn right onto Shunfu Road, Singapore.

> \[Footage of the accident was captured on CCTV which will be played along with the reading of the SOF\]

> 5    The accused first stopped the Car at the gantry, at the continuous white line, to clear the carpark barrier.

> 6    Once the accused cleared the gantry, the accused moved the Car ahead to the non-signalized “T” junction of Sin Ming Plaza exit and Shunfu Road (the “T-Junction”).

> 7    The accused waited at the T-Junction for approximately 3 seconds to check his right and then his left before moving-off to execute a right-turn into Shunfu Road in the direction of Marymount Road.

> 8    At the same time, the victim and the witness were riding the Motorcycle along Shunfu Road in the direction of Sin Ming Road, travelling from the accused’s right to the accused’s left. The Motorcycle had the right of way.

> 9    As the accused was in the midst of completing the right-turn into Shunfu Road in the direction of Marymount Road, the front left of the Car collided with the rear left of the Motorcycle. The accused had negligently failed to keep a proper look out and moved-off to execute a right-turn without noticing the witness and the victim travelling along Shunfu Road in the direction of Sin Ming Road, thus endangering the lives of others.

> 10    The witness could not avoid the Car as the Car had suddenly turned into the path of the Motorcycle. There was a collision and both the witness and the victim fell off the Motorcycle onto the road to the left of the Car. Both the witness and victim were injured and bleeding.

> 11    As a result of the fall, the victim was conveyed by an ambulance to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital (“TTSH”). A medical report for the victim prepared by Dr Anuj Chawla of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of TTSH dated 14 July 2018 (the “Report”) noted that the victim had sustained the following injuries:

>> (a)    Multiple abrasions over left knee and superficial linear abrasion over left anterior calf;

>> (b)    Minimally displaced fracture of proximal tibia and fibula neck with extension to posterior aspect of lateral tibial plateau;

>> (c)    Lipohaemarthrosis and associated degenerative changes in left knee joint;

>> (d)    Schatzker type 6 lateral tibia plateau fracture left;

>> (e)    Proximal fibula fracture; and

>> (f)    Advanced tricompartmental osteoarthritis of left knee joint.

> 12    The above-mentioned injuries were caused by the negligent act of the accused.

> 13    The Report stated that the victim’s injuries did not require an operation. The victim’s left lower limb was put in a cast with her knee in full extension. The victim was warded at TTSH for a total of 14 days from 25 June 2018 till 8 July 2018. The victim was issued hospitalisation leave for a total of 19 days from 25 June 2018 till 13 July 2018. The victim suffered mobility problems as a result of the accident and required the assistance of a wheelchair up till 2 February 2019. The victim also required physiotherapy up till October 2018. As of the date of this SOF, the victim is able to walk unassisted for about 100 metres. The victim still feels stiff and pain from her injuries. The victim has to elevate her legs when resting on a daily basis to prevent them from swelling.

> 14    The Car sustained scratches and a dent on its front left portion as a result of the accident. The Motorcycle sustained scratches to its right portion as a result of the accident.

> 15    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence punishable under section 338(_b_) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> 16    At the time of the accident, the weather was fine, road surface was dry and visibility was clear. There were no mechanical faults detected on the Car or the Motorcycle prior to the accident.

> 17    The accused has admitted to the above offence.

## PRESCRIBED PUNISHMENT

5       The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 338(b) is a term of imprisonment which may extend to 2 years or a fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both. By virtue of s 42(1) of the Road Traffic Act, where an offence is in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle, an offender would also be liable to disqualification for such a period as the court may think fit.

## SENTENCING FRAMEWORK

6       The sentencing framework for offences under s 338(b) was set out in _Tang Ling Lee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 18</span> _(“Tang Ling Lee”_) where See Kee Oon, J set out the following presumptive sentencing ranges at \[31\]:-

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="18.503700740148%"> <col width="52.130426085217%"> <col width="29.3658731746349%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Category</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Circumstances</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Presumptive</b></p><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and lower culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Fines</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and lower culpability Or</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Lesser harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">One to two weeks’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Greater harm and higher culpability</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">More than two weeks’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

7       See, J further explained at \[32\] that sentencing should be a two-step process:-

> 32    In sentencing an offender for a road traffic case under s 338(_b_) of the Penal Code, therefore, the court should undertake a two-step inquiry:

>> (a)    First, the court should identify the sentencing band within which the offence in question falls, and also where the particular case falls within the applicable presumptive sentencing range, having regard to the twin considerations of harm and culpability, in order to derive the starting point sentence.

>> (b) Second, further adjustments should then be made to take into account the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, which may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable presumptive sentencing range.

> Examples of relevant mitigating factors may include an offender’s timely plea of guilt, stopping to render assistance to the victim(s), a good driving record, and evidence of remorse. Relevant aggravating factors, on the other hand, may include efforts to avoid detection or apprehension and the existence of similar antecedents, which are indicative of persistent or prolonged bad driving.

8       The prosecution had rightly classified the harm caused as relatively low.[^1] However, it sought to classify this as a _Category 2[^2]_ case on account of the accused’s culpability alone.[^3] It was contended that the accused’s culpability was in the moderate to high range for the following reasons:-[^4]

> (a)     the motorcycle had the right of way;

> (b)     visibility was good at the material time and there was no reason for the accused not to have seen the motorcycle; and

> (c)     the accused had completely failed to notice the motorcycle before executing the right turn by checking his right again after he had looked once to the right and to the left.

9       In _Tang Ling Lee_, See, J held that the manner of driving and the circumstances surrounding the incident were relevant in assessing culpability for offences under s 338(b). He stated (at \[28\]-\[29\]):-

> 28…    In relation to the manner of driving, some examples of situations where culpability would be increased include speeding, drink driving, sleepy driving, driving while under the influence of drugs, driving while using a mobile phone, flouting traffic rules, driving against the flow of traffic or off the road, involvement in a car chase or a racing competition, or exhibiting poor control of his vehicle … These circumstances in relation to the offender’s manner of driving are aggravating due to the increased danger to road users posed by such conduct.

> 29    Second, the circumstances surrounding the incident should also be taken into account. This would include instances where the offender drives without a licence or while under disqualification. In _Suse Nathen_ (at \[28\]), it was considered that there may be increased risk where the offender drives: (a) during rush hours when the volume of traffic is heavy; (b) within a residential or school zone; (c) a heavy vehicle that is more difficult to control and requires a quicker reaction time; or (d) where he intends to travel a substantial distance to reach his destination. These circumstances may heighten the danger posed to road users.

10     None of these culpability increasing factors or similar types of factors were present in the case at hand. It should also be noted that traffic at that time was light.[^5] In my view, the factors stated at \[8\] herein which were relied on by the prosecution did not bring this case under _Category 2_. The factors were little more than a re-iteration of what was stated in the charge and SOF i.e. that the accused had not kept a proper lookout while executing the right turn.

11     In _Tang Ling Lee_, the offenders’ culpability was classified as moderate to high. The offender was executing a right turn at a major traffic junction. She made no effort to check for oncoming vehicles before executing the right turn. She did not even stop at the right turning pocket and collided with the victim which was the only vehicle approaching from the opposite side. In the present case, the accused did stop to check for vehicles before executing a right turn. As stated in the SOF, he stopped at the non-signalized junction of the Sin Ming Plaza exit and Shunfu Road and had checked his right and then his left before executing a right turn into Shufu Road.[^6] From my observation of the video of the accident, the accused had moved off at a slow speed in a manner which was not aggressive. In my assessment, his culpability was therefore somewhat lower than that in _Tang Ling Lee_.

12     In _Public Prosecutor v Ong Heng Chua_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 95</span> (_“Ong Heng Chua”_), the offender was a taxi driver who had a poor driving record. He flouted traffic rules and drove against the flow of traffic in a lane leading to a car park at a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) estate. His taxi went beyond the central divider after he executed a wide left turn. He deliberately chose not to move back into his own lane and had little regard for other road users. He was driving quite fast and was only compelled to slow down because of two road humps before the collision took place. The victim was riding a motorcycle and suffered grievous hurt. On appeal, See Kee Oon, J held that the offender’s culpability under a s 338(b) offence was at least of a moderate level. The original sentence of a fine of $5,000 was enhanced to one week’s imprisonment while the original term of 18 months’ disqualification was upheld. When compared to _Ong Heng Chua_, the accused’s culpability was much lower. He did not flout any traffic rules nor did he drive at a fast speed. He had a clean driving record. There were no aggravating or culpability increasing factors. In my view, the prosecution’s position that the accused should in effect receive a similar sentence as _Ong Heng Chua_ was excessive and could not be justified.

13     For the reasons aforesaid, I could not accept the prosecution’s submission that this should be a _Category 2_ case on account of the accused’s culpability. Since there was an absence of any culpability increasing factors, I assessed this to be a _Category 1_ case as there was lesser harm and lower culpability. A fine would therefore be the appropriate punishment.

## THE ISSUE OF PROBATION AND DISQUALIFICATION

14     The defence submitted for probation to be imposed and I called for a pre-sentence report on account of the accused’s relatively young age. The probation report recommended that the accused could be placed on 6 months’ administrative probation, perform 40 hours of community service and that the accused’s paternal uncle be bonded. The prosecution submitted that probation would not be suitable as apart from the principle of rehabilitation, deterrence and retribution should also feature strongly.[^7]

15     In cases under s 338(b) involving driving offences, a term of disqualification is almost invariably imposed. Disqualification would be necessary for protecting members of the public from offenders who had displayed poor driving skills and for deterrent purposes. In _Ong Heng Chua_, the rationale of disqualification orders was explained at \[61\]:-

> 61    The most important sentencing principles engaged in disqualification orders are the protection of society, because the objective of disqualification orders is to prevent future harm that the offender may cause to the public, and deterrence, because such orders deprive offenders of the freedom to drive. In line with these principles, greater weight should be placed on the culpability of the offender in the commission of the offence as well as his driving record. These reflect how much of a danger he poses to society, and are also indicative of the degree of specific deterrence necessary. The precedents, as set out above at \[53\]-\[59\], are generally consistent with this analysis.

16     In the present case, I was of the view that disqualification would be appropriate to protect members of the public as well as for deterrence, since the accused had caused grievous hurt to the victim due to unsafe driving.[^8] However, if an order of probation were to be made, the accused could not be disqualified. In _Public Prosecutor v Abdul Hameed s/o Abdul Rahman_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] SGHC 136</span>, Yong Pung How, CJ held at \[12\]:-

> 12    Probation is governed by the Probation of Offenders Act. Section 5 of that Act allows the court to impose a probation order instead of a sentence. Then s 11 reads:

>> (1)    Subject as hereinafter provided, a conviction for an offence for which an order is made under this Act placing the offender on probation … shall be deemed not to be a conviction for any purpose other than the purposes of the proceedings in which the order is made and of any subsequent proceedings which may be taken against the offender under the foregoing provisions of this Act. …

>> (2)    Without prejudice to subsection (1), the conviction of an offender who is placed on probation or discharged absolutely or conditionally as aforesaid shall in any event be disregarded for the purposes of any written law which imposes any disqualification or disability upon convicted persons, or authorises or requires the imposition of any such disqualification or disability.

> Subsection (2) is clear in its operation. The imposition of a probation order is not to be considered as a conviction for the purposes of disqualification under any written law. The second respondent was therefore not convicted for the purposes of s 379A and he should therefore not have been disqualified. This is a serious injustice going to the root of the court’s powers and the order made by the district judge is accordingly quashed.

17     While probation was recommended, it was not a viable sentencing option as disqualification could not be imposed pursuant to an order of probation. In my view, the duty to protect society from unsafe driving had to take precedence over the accused’s need for rehabilitation. While he claimed to have stopped driving since the offence was committed and hoped to undertake driving revision lessons,[^9] there would be nothing to stop him from driving immediately if no order of disqualification could be imposed. In the circumstances, I was constrained to make an order of probation and did not do so.

## CALIBRATION OF SENTENCE

18     I have found that this case fell within _Category 1_ where a fine would be the appropriate punishment. Taking into account the nature and circumstances of the offence, the starting point would be at the higher end of the range, at or close to the maximum fine of $5,000. I noted also that a further charge under s 337(b) was taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

19     In the accused’s favour, he was a young offender who had a clean driving record. He stopped to render assistance to the victims. He was remorseful and had pleaded guilty in a timely manner. I agreed with defence counsel that he was a person of good standing and character and that he had a bright future ahead of him. In view of these strong mitigating factors, I calibrated sentence downwards and imposed a fine of $2,500 which fell at the mid-point of the possible range of fines.

20     The prosecution had submitted for a disqualification period of 18 months, based on the premise that this should be a _Category 2_ case. As I found that this was a _Category 1_ case, I calibrated disqualification downwards to 12 months.

## CONCLUSION

21     I am of the view that sentence imposed is proportionate to the offence and that it is neither manifestly inadequate or excessive.
