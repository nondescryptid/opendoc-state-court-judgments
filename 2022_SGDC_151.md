### District Judge Carol Ling Feng Yong:

## Charge and Sentence

1       The Accused, a dog-trainer, pleaded guilty to a charge under section 41C(1)(a)(iii) of the Animals and Birds Act, Chapter 7. The charge read:

> “You…… are charged that you, on 25 August 2020 sometime between 2pm and 4pm, at an open air carpark at 10 Cactus Drive, Singapore 809687, in the course of carrying on an animal-related business as a dog trainer, did, being the owner of a French Bulldog named “Chocoby” (the “dog”) which was then under your care, failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the dog was not confined in a manner that subjected the dog to unnecessary pain and suffering, to wit, you failed to remove the dog from your car (a Mercedes A200 bearing registration plate SLE9505H, hereafter the “car”) after you had parked and exited the said car, confining the dog within the car for a period of about 1.5 hours, causing heat exposure and death to the dog, and you have thereby contravened Section 41C(1)(a)(iii) of the Animals and Birds Act (Cap. 7) and committed an offence under Section 41C(2) which is punishable under Section 41C(3)(a)(i) of the Act.

2       A similar charge in respect of another dog “Hunniby” was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

3       I imposed a fine of $8,000 and further disqualified the Accused from being a person in charge of any animal or class of animals in the course of any employment with any animal-related business for a period of 6 months, under section 43B(1)(a)(ii) of the Animals and Birds Act, Chapter 7.

4       It is against this order of disqualification which the Accused appeals.

## Facts relating to the Incident

5       The Accused admitted to the Statement of Facts without qualification. The key facts are set out below.

6       The Complainant is one Tay Jun Yi (“Ms Tay”). She was the owner of two French Bulldogs, named “Chocoby” and “Hunniby”. She had imported both dogs into Singapore from Australia. The Accused is a dog-trainer and has been one since 2014.

7       Sometime in January 2020, Ms Tay engaged the Accused to train Chocoby for 10 sessions. Subsequently when Hunniby arrived in Singapore, she engaged the Accused to provide training for Hunniby as well. The arrangement involved boarding and training services where both dogs would stay with the Accused during the whole training period.

8       On 25 August 2020, the Accused drove both dogs in a car bearing registration plate SLE9505H (“the car”), for training at Veragoo Close. The car is a hatchback with an open boot area. The dogs were placed by the Accused in the boot area of the car during her drive. The training session started at about 12.30pm and ended at around 1.45pm. After the session, the Accused placed both dogs in the car boot of her car and drove home. The air-conditioning in the car was switched on during the journey. Upon reaching home at approximately 2:30pm, the Accused parked her car with the windows wound up and turned off the engine which also ended the air-conditioning. The car was parked in an unsheltered spot in the open-air carpark.

9       Distracted by a social media post involving a former customer’s second dog being bitten by another dog, the Accused forgot to remove both dogs from the car when she exited the car. She then closed the car door leaving both animals in the car boot. She then went up to her apartment. Approximately one and a half hours later, at around 4:00 pm, the Accused realised that she had left the two dogs in the car. She immediately ran to the car and found both dogs unresponsive.

10     The Accused then sent both dogs to “The Animal Doctors”, a nearby veterinary clinic, reaching at about 4.30pm. At the clinic, the dogs were examined by the veterinarian, one Dr Serena Oh. Both dogs were dead by the time they arrived at the clinic.

11     Both medical summaries, dated 25 August 2020 and 3 April 2022, from Dr Serena Oh supported the diagnosis of heat stress as the cause of death. Tissue samples from Chocoby were sent for a for a post-mortem examination. The Veterinary Pathology Report dated 31 August 2020 stated that Chocoby had been in a stressful state prior to its demise with increased turnover of erythrocytes. The medical summaries of Dr Serene Oh and the Veterinary Pathology Report were attached to the Statement of Facts.

12     As an ‘_owner_’ is defined under Section 2 of the Animals and Birds Act, Chapter 7 as including any person for the time being in charge of any animal, the Accused, as the person for the time being in charge of the dog, had failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the dog, Chocoby, was not confined in a manner that subjected the dog to unnecessary pain and suffering, namely by failing to remove the dog from the car after she had parked and exited the car resulting in it being subjected to heat exposure and eventually dying from heat stress.

## Prescribed Punishment

13     The prescribed punishment for a first offence under section 41C(3)(a)(i) of the Animals and Birds Act, is a fine not exceeding $40,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both. The Accused was also liable to be disqualified from being a person in charge of any animal or class of animals in the course of any employment with any animal-related business for a period not exceeding 12 months.

14     On the charge, I imposed a fine of $8,000 and further disqualified the Accused from being a person in charge of any animal or class of animals in the course of any employment with any animal-related business for a period of 6 months, under section 43B(1)(a)(ii) of the Animals and Birds Act, Chapter 7.

## Reasons for the Disqualification

15     A key sentencing objective in such cases is deterrence. An order of disqualification meets that objective. As made clear in Parliament, the 2014 amendments to the Animals and Birds Act which legislated higher penalties for offences committed by animal-related business, not only targeted the profit motives of animal-related business but also “_underscored the greater responsibility_” animal-related businesses should bear, seeing how they have a “_greater obligation to care or provide for the welfare of animals and cannot claim ignorance of what constitutes proper care for animals”_. The disqualification in section 43B of the Act was enacted to serve as a “_social deterrent_” to offenders[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1). Disqualification is designed as a critical component of a sentence under the Animals and Birds Act, even though it is discretionary.

16     I was satisfied that an order of disqualification was warranted in this case. I was well-aware of the somewhat unusual facts. It was undisputed that the Accused had forgotten about the dogs in her boot, having been distracted by a social media post concerning a client’s dog which had been bitten by another dog whilst out on a walk[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2). Defence Counsel stressed several times in the course of mitigation that this was essentially “_a case of inadvertence_”[^3]. The Accused would never have left the dogs in the car if she had remembered them. In the words of the Defence Counsel: “_Forgetting is human error and it affects even the best of us_.” I did not disagree with that proposition put forward by Defence Counsel.

17     That said, an act of forgetfulness, whilst “_attributable to the fallible nature of human beings_”[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) and may be completely understandable, do sometimes and regrettably, attract dire consequences, as this case has shown. The fact is: outcomes do matter. The extent of harm caused by one’s actions is a relevant and important factor to be considered in determining the appropriate sentence, even if it may not be the only one. Hence, even though I was able to accept that the Accused was lacking in “_intent_” in this case - a point repeatedly emphasized by Defence Counsel[^5], the severity of the harm caused by the Accused’s actions was high and could not be downplayed.

18     The conduct of the Accused in forgetting about the dogs in her boot may not be characterised as “_abuse_”[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) but the fact remained that two dogs died, as a result of the Accused’s oversight. There was evidence before the court that the dogs had suffered tremendously before they died, within the one and a half hours in the parked car[^7]. Prosecution pointed out that Chocoby’s body temperature was recorded at 40.4 degrees Celsius when it was brought to the veterinary clinic[^8], and that was after Chocoby’s body had been cooled down with ice. It was probable that the body temperature of Chocoby was higher when it was in the car. Prosecution added that “_the dogs’ internal systems would have been working overtime to regulate the rising temperatures and the experience would have been excruciating for the dogs before they succumbed_.”[^9] The medical reports confirmed that Chocoby had suffered from heat-induced stress and eventually died. In my view, the outcome arising from the Accused’s conduct was grave and called for a good measure of deterrence.

19     Further, as highlighted by the Prosecution, the Accused is a professional dog-trainer, having undergone the requisite training to receive accreditation as a dog-trainer. I agreed with the Prosecution that as a professional dog trainer, the duty of care expected of the Accused was higher than that of a regular person temporarily in charge of a dog. The Accused had been entrusted with two dogs by its owner for boarding and training over a period of time and the incident could have been avoided if the Accused had established protocols or checks in place when bringing the dogs out[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10). A disqualification, along with the appropriate fine, was necessary to impress that upon the Accused as she continued in her work as a dog-trainer.

20     The imposition of a disqualification would also send an effective signal to others involved in animal-related businesses of the standards with which they have to maintain in the industry[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11). As stated in Parliament: “T_he key guiding principles in our legislative review were therefore to make the legislation more responsive and preventive, in addressing the welfare of the animals in the way that they are cared for, as well as to instil responsible and appropriate behaviour in all stakeholders who play a part in an animal's life cycle…. A new section 41C is proposed to place legal responsibility on owners and persons in charge of animals to provide proper care for them so that the welfare of animals is attended to in a way that they are cared for and not just limited to punishing acts of cruelty after such acts had taken place.”_[^12]. The imposition of a disqualification serves as a general deterrence to persons involved in animal -related businesses who may be tempted to be lackadaisical in their standard of care of animals left in their charge.

21     I was fully cognizant that the Accused was a first offender and had pleaded guilty, even though the guilty plea was only entered at the door-step of trial. The Accused’s conduct after the incident was clearly demonstrative of her remorse and contrition for her actions; she was genuinely sorry for what had happened. However, in my view, the presence of these mitigating factors and others as highlighted by Defence Counsel in his submissions, did not diminish the deterrent value of a disqualification which was warranted on the facts of this case.

## The Appropriate Length of Disqualification

22     The maximum length of disqualification provided under section 43B(1)(a)(ii) of the Animals and Birds Act is 12 months. The Prosecution sought the maximum term of 12 months; Defence pleaded for the Court not to impose any term of disqualification. The case precedents tendered (most of which were unreported), showed a general range of disqualification terms of 6 to 12 months. For the cases which were reported[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13), there was no discernible pattern in respect of the length of the disqualification imposed, although the maximum term of disqualification appeared to be imposed in serious cases of animal abuse.

23     Bearing in mind the facts as well as the mitigating factors, I was satisfied that a 6-month disqualification would be fair and just in the circumstances of the case. In my view, the Accused was not deserving of the maximum term of disqualification when it was clear on the facts that she had not intended the harm which the dog eventually suffered from. However, given the gravity of the outcome resulting from the Accused failing to take reasonable steps in the care of the dogs under her charge, a 6-month disqualification was necessary.

## Conclusion

24     The Accused has been granted instalments to pay the fine of $8,000, with the final payment due on 30 September 2022. The disqualification imposed on the Accused has been stayed pending the hearing of this appeal.
