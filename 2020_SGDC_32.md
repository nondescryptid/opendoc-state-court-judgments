Sale of Goods Act – Breach of Contract – Repudiatory Breach – Discharge of Contract

12 February 2020

### District Judge Lee Li Choon:

## Introduction

1       The Plaintiff (“Willsoon”) supplied a “Willsoon Super Combi Vacuum Tanker” (“Combi”) to the Defendant (“Star Group”). The Combi is a machine that combines the ability to shoot high-pressure jets of water to dislodge silt and materials that clog sewers and drains with the ability to vacuum up the waste into a storage tank that is used to transport the waste to other locations for proper disposal. Such machinery is typically mounted onto trucks (which are separately procured).[^1]

2       Willsoon’s claim against Star Group is for the balance sum of $125,400 remaining unpaid for the Combi and additional costs of modifications performed on the said Combi on 3 occasions - 14 February 2017, 21 March 2017 and 6 April 2017, bringing the total amount claimed by the Plaintiff to the sum of S$167,490.75.

3       In their Defence, Star Group’s position is that they are entitled to reject the Combi for the following reasons:

> (a)     That the Combi was built with a single 6-inch valve, instead of two separate discharge and suction valves (a 6-inch discharge valve and a 4-inch suction valve) as stipulated in the “agreement”(the specifications for the Combi are found in the Sales Quotation and the drawing that accompanied the Sales Quotation[^2]) (“the 4-inch suction valve issue”)

> (b)     That the Combi’s tank was not built to the size of 15,000 litres as required by the “agreement” (“the capacity issue”)

> (c)     That the Combi was not delivered within the expected date of 17 December 2016 which was a material term of the “agreement”

> (d)     That, by virtue of the defects (a) and (b) above, the Combi does not correspond with the description of the Combi as set out in the “agreement”

> (e)     That, by virtue of the defects (a), (b) and other defects, the Combi is unfit for use and in breach of section 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act (“SOGA”) and that the Combi is in breach of the implied condition that the Combi would be of satisfactory quality and therefore contravenes section 14(2), (2A), (2B) of the SOGA.

4       Star Group’s counterclaim against Willsoon is for a declaration that Star Group had rightfully terminated the “agreement” and is entitled not to take delivery of the Combi and for the sum of $120,000 paid to be returned to Star Group as well as for damages suffered because of the alleged breaches.

## Facts That Are Not In Dispute

6       The following facts are not in dispute - That the Combi supplied by Willsoon did not comply with the following “specifications” that are stipulated in the Sales Quotation:

> (a)     The Combi does not have a 6-inch gate valve for discharge and a 4-inch ball valve for suction. Instead, the Combi supplied by Willsoon has only one 6-inch valve that is to be used for both discharge and suction purposes with the 6-inch valve being convertible to a 4-inch suction valve by the installation of a 4 inch reducer flange for suction – (“_4-inch suction valve issue_”).

> (b)     The Combi’s tank capacity is not supplied with the “maximum water volume” capacity that is stated as 15,000 litres in the Sales Quotation[^23]. Instead, the Combi is supplied with a tank with maximum water volume capacity of 14,000 litres (“_capacity issue_”).

> (c)     The “delivery lead time” was stated to be “12-13 Working Weeks” in the Sales Quotation. The Combi first arrived in Willsoon’s warehouse from China on 6 January 2017[^24] (“_delay issue_”).

## Relevant Issues

7       After two rounds of amendments to the pleadings arising from Star Group’s amendments to their Defence and Counterclaim, it was agreed at trial that the following broad issues are the issues for the Court’s findings:

> (a)     Whether Star Group is in breach of the agreement in relation to the 4- inch suction valve issue and the capacity issue and whether these defects render the Combi non-compliant with the specification; as such, whether Willsoon is in breach of the implied condition that the Combi will correspond to the description in the agreement within the meaning of section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393)[^25].

> (b)     Whether, by reason of all of the alleged defects, the Combi was unfit for purpose and was not of satisfactory quality and in breach of the implied conditions within the meaning of section 14(3), 14(2), 14(2A), 14(2B) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 393)[^26].

> (c)     Whether Willsoon has breached a material term in the agreement by virtue of the late delivery of the Combi.

> (d)     Whether, by reason of the alleged breaches, Star Group is entitled to reject the Combi.

> (e)     Whether Willsoon is entitled to the costs for the “modifications”

9       I will first make my findings on the two alleged defects - the 4-inch valve issue and the capacity issue that Star Group is relying on to say that the Combi did not correspond to its description in the agreement before addressing the other issues.

## My Decision

### 4-inch suction valve issue

10     The Sales Quotation dated 17 September 2016[^27] states:

> “Rear Door: Hydraulic powered opening with two (2) manual hand wheels 6” gate valve for discharge and 4” ball valve for suction”

11     It is not disputed that the Combi was manufactured with a single 6-inch valve, instead of two separate valves – one for discharge and one for suction. It is also not disputed that Willsoon would have been aware that the Combi did not have a 4-inch ball valve for suction on the rear door as stated in the Sales Quotation when Willsoon’s Dave Low went to China to inspect the building of the Combi in October 2016 or when the Combi arrived at Willsoon’s workshop on 6 January 2017. Nevertheless, this was not raised to Star Group’s attention until the first testing session, which took place on 14 February 2017[^28].

#### Willsoon’s Position

12     Willsoon’s position is that the issue concerning the 4-inch suction valve was raised at the 1st Testing Session on 14 February 2017 and Star Group had accepted and agreed to Willsoon’s suggestion to install a 4-inch reducer flange onto the existing 6-inch valve to convert the 6-inch valve to a 4-inch suction valve when using the valve for suction[^29]. The proposed solution would mean that the same valve would be used for both discharge and suction. Willsoon also says that subsequent to the suggestion by Willsoon and the acceptance thereof by Star Group, there were no further objections as regards the 4-inch valve by Star Group[^30]. Willsoon therefore says that Star Group has already accepted the solution of installing a 4-inch reducer flange and that therefore, Star Group is not entitled to re-surface this as a defect.

13     Willsoon further says that Star Group’s allegation that the suction valve cannot be used for the refilling of water because “PUB requires the discharge valve to be sealed after discharging”[^31] was a requirement that was never mentioned to Willsoon and Willsoon was never made aware of such alleged PUB requirement. Willsoon’s Rafael also pointed out in his affidavit of evidence in chief that this “PUB requirement” only surfaced after the Defence and Counterclaim was amended on 2 April 2019, more than 20 months after the original Defence and Counterclaim was filed[^32]. Willsoon’s Rafael also said that after the installation of a 4-inch reducer flange onto the existing single 6-inch valve after the testing session on 14 February 2017, Star Group did not raise any further issues with regard to the suction valve whether by email or otherwise and this is despite there being another testing session on 21 March 2017[^33]. Willsoon therefore contends that this is a red herring and the defect was raised as an afterthought.

#### Star Group’s Position

14     Star Group’s position is that Willsoon did not convey the Combi’s lack of a 4-inch suction valve to Star Group and that it was Star Group that discovered the issue at the testing on 14 February 2017. Star Group maintained that thereafter, they had never accepted the solution of installing a 4-inch reducer as suggested by Willsoon.

15     In the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Simon Lim, advisor of Star Group, he explained that PUB requires the discharge valve to be sealed after discharging and that “this seal can only be removed by PUB when the Combi next enters NEA/PUB’s designated premises for the disposal/discharge of waste”. Star Group therefore says that the discharge valve cannot be converted for use for the refilling of water and that, the solution suggested by Willsoon of installing a 4-inch reducer cannot work. Simon Lim’s explanation was also the justification used by Star Group to maintain their position that they had never agreed to the solution proposed by Willsoon. In closing submissions, Star Group maintains that the Combi did not conform to the description in the Sales Quotation and therefore, Willsoon was in breach of the implied condition that the Combi would be in accordance with its description, i.e., the Combi will come equipped with a 4-inch suction valve.

#### My Decision

16     The evidence shows that on 16 February 2017, Willsoon’s Chai Kian Meng sent an email to Star Group’s Simon Lim stating, _“..would like to check with you regarding the rectification issues on combi as per below: 1) Regarding the 4” connector required for the vacuum clean water purpose during the visit Tuesday. Can we connect a reducer from 6” (as shown in the attach above) to 4” with quick coupling? Is there any material specification for the reducer quick coupling?”[^34]_ According to Willsoon’s Rafael Low, the issue with regard to the lack of a 4-inch suction valve was surfaced at the testing session on 14 February 2017 and he had suggested to Star Group’s Simon Lim who was there at the testing session that the installation of a 4-inch reducer flange is a solution. According to Rafael, this solution was proposed by him and was accepted by Simon at the testing session[^35].

17     Looking at the email from Willsoon’s Kian Meng which was sent two days after the testing session on 14 February in which the 4-inch suction valve issue was first raised, it does show clearly that there was a prior discussion about this issue of converting the 6-inch valve to a 4-inch valve as he had made a reference to “_during the visit Tuesday_”. The email sent 2 days later therefore corroborates Rafael’s testimony that this solution was discussed at the testing session on 14 February 2016 and the email follow-up was to confirm “_the material specification for the reducer quick coupling_”. I do note however, that as of 16 February 2017, in the email response from Star Group’s Simon to Willsoon’s Rafael, the issue of the lack of the 4-inch suction valve was reiterated as one of the outstanding “problems” with regard to the Combi as: “11) Suction point – 4” suction point to be added on for refilling of water”[^36].

18     On the other hand, I note that Star Group first alluded to PUB’s requirement for the sealing of the discharge valve, rendering the conversion of the discharge valve to a suction valve for the filling of water by using a 4-inch reducer flange an unworkable solution only in the supplementary affidavit by Star Group’s Simon and that was filed some 20 months after the filing of the original Defence and Counterclaim. In the original Defence and Counterclaim, what was pleaded in relation to the issue of the lack of a suction valve was that, “_..the suction valve was not built in the initial design of the Combi. Only the discharge valve for the Combi was built. The Defendant avers that the suction valve is a fundamental component of the Combi and without it, the refilling of water for the ordinary function and operation of the Combi would be_ _Significantly difficult_. _For example, instead of being able to simply refill the Combi cylinder with water using the suction valve, the Defendant’s workers would have to climb to the top inlet of the Combi in order to refill the water in the Combi cylinder using alternative means such as, a portable pump with a water hose_.” (emphasis mine).

19     Thus, based on the original pleadings, what Star Group had alleged as the problem with the lack of a separate 4-inch suction valve was “significant difficulty”. There was no mention whatsoever about this PUB’s requirement that renders Willsoon’s proposed solution totally unworkable in Star Group’s original pleadings. In any event, even if there was such a PUB requirement that would render Willsoon’s proposed solution for the lack of a 4-inch suction valve “unworkable”, the evidence adduced does not show the existence of such a requirement. Furthermore, there is no evidence whatsoever to show that such a requirement and/or that Willsoon’s proposed solution was unworkable because of such a requirement by PUB was ever communicated to Willsoon during the material time. There is not a shred of evidence to show that this requirement was communicated to Willsoon by Star Group before the Combi was built or at least, by the first testing session on 14 February 2016. Therefore, other than a mere assertion, this allegation of Star Group that Willsoon’s proposed solution for the lack of a 4-inch valve is unworkable is not substantiated by any supporting evidence at all.

20     Star Group’s allusion to PUB’s requirement rendering Willsoon’s proposed solution unworkable thus appears to be an afterthought.

21     Most importantly, the 4-inch suction valve issue was not raised at or after the first testing session. If this was such an important matter due to PUB’s requirement, it is inexplicable why this issue was not brought up at the very first instance. In addition, notwithstanding that there was a subsequent testing session on 21 March 2017, nothing further was raised on this issue of the lack of a 4-inch suction valve.

22     Willsoon’s evidence is that the proposed solution was shown to Star Group’s Simon at the subsequent testing session on 21 March 2017 and that it was met with silence. If Star Group is to be believed, that is that the lack of a 4-inch suction valve is a material breach and that the 4-inch reducer flange was an “unworkable” solution, it is curious why, when the solution was shown to Star Group’s Simon during the testing session on 21 March 2017, nothing more was said about it. This is particularly so in light of the fact that after the testing session on 21 March 2017, there were further email exchanges between the parties but in none of the email responses from Simon Lim, the issue as regards the 4-inch suction valve was surfaced again.

23     At trial, it was explained by Willsoon’s Raphael that Star Group informed Willsoon that the reason why Star Group needed a 4-inch valve for suction is that Star Group’s water hose was a 4-inch hose. From Willsoon’s perspective, it was never explained to them that the discharge valve and the suction valve have to be separate valves. As far as they are concerned, their proposed solution to use the same valve for discharge and for suction was accepted by Star Group.

> “Q    Okay. So, when Mr. Lim at page 144 asked you at point 11 to add the 4-inch suction point. Do you agree with me, he’s really just asking you to comply with what is specified in the contract at AB1? And you can turn back to AB1 to refresh your memory again.

> A    Actually, at that point, he explained to me that his suction hose was a 4-inch. So, instead of the 6-inch he---he needed something that can adapt to his 4-inch suction hose. So I suggested to him, just put a reducer, it serves the---it serves the purpose. No difference.

> Q    So, in other words, you don’t agree with me that this was an attempt to comply with the contractual specifications?

> A    I’m not---I’m not sure about that but actually that was the conversation that we had at that time.

> Q    Okay. My instructions are that that’s not the case. Agree or disagree?

> A    I disagree.

> Q    Okay. And as you mentioned, the solution that you proposed is to install what is called a reducer flange which is something that reduces a 6-inch nozzle to a 4-inch nozzle, correct?

> A    That’s correct. It’s not a flange, it’s a coupling.

> Q    Certainly. And perhaps for Her Honour’s benefit, if you could turn to page 208. Could you just confirm that’s the reducer that you’re describing?

> A    It’s the reducer with the coupling.

> Q    Now, based on what is here, my understanding is therefore, once you put on the re---coupling and the reducer, the 6-inch valve cannot be used at the same time as the 4-inch valve. Only 1 valve can be used at any point in time.

> A    Yes, only one valve can be used. Um, no, I mean, you cannot use it at the same time. You cannot use it at the same time.

> Q    Okay. Now, you’re aware of Stargroup’s position in this proceedings that they require separate valves.

> A    I think only like, uh, how many years later and then they---they make that pleading. So---

> Q    So, are you aware of their position?

> A    I---I read their supplementary details, they just added it in, uh.

> Q    Okay.

> A    So—

> Q    So---

> A    I’m only recently aware”[^37]

24     According to Willsoon’s Rafael, converting the 6-inch valve by using a 4-inch reducer with a coupling is also something that can easily be done in a matter of 30 seconds[^38].

25     I find that there is therefore no evidence to suggest that the proposed solution by Willsoon was something that could not be implemented. As for Star Group’s contention that the solution was unworkable due to PUB’s or NEA’s requirement, I find that this only surfaced after trial has started. There is no evidence whatsoever to show that this requirement of PUB or NEA was discussed between the parties or communicated to Willsoon prior to the building of the Combi or soon after the issue was surfaced at the 1st Testing Session on 14 February 2017.

26     Based on the above analysis of the evidence adduced, I find that Willsoon’s testimony that their proposed solution of converting the 6-inch valve by using a 4-inch reducer with a coupling for suction (which according to Rafael’s unchallenged evidence, could be done in a matter of a few seconds) was eventually accepted by Star Group to be more consistent and credible.

27     In any event, I agree with Willsoon’s contention that the contract in question is not a sale by description based on the specifications set out in the contract because the Combi was a bespoke equipment that was tailor-made for Star Group and parties discussed the various specifications before finalising the final product.[^39] I note that at the point of the Sale Quotation, parties were still in the initial stages of discussions. I also find that it is in the nature of such bespoke contracts that modifications to the specifications may be made and accepted by parties. Thus, it is not uncommon to encounter a situation where the eventual specifications of products vary from the original descriptions.

28     Therefore, where the evidence shows that the modifications had been discussed and accepted, it is not for the purchasing party to use the fact that the goods did not conform to the original description to reject the goods and get out of its contractual obligations. In cases involving bespoke products, the question as to whether there is a breach of section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act should be answered after taking into account the unique circumstances for such bespoke contracts. In this case, I am satisfied that the evidence shows that Star Group had accepted the modification in relation to the 4-inch suction valve. Star Group should not be allowed to now resurface this as a breach of section 13(1) of the Sale of Goods Act that allows them to get out of the contract.

29     Based on my findings above, I find that there is no breach as regards the lack of the 4-inch suction valve in the Combi as the modification by converting the 6-nch valve using a 4-inch reducer with a coupling had been accepted by Star Group. Further, Star Group has not adduced any evidence to show or establish that the 4-inch suction valve breach is a material breach that renders the Combi so defective or unusable as to substantially deprive Star Group of the benefit of having the Combi and that entitles Star Group to thereby treat the breach as a repudiation of the agreement by Willsoon and to then be able to reject the Combi.

### Capacity issue

30     The Sales Quotation states, “Debris/Water Tank – Size: 15000 Lit”. It is not disputed that the tank capacity is 14,000 litres and not 15,000 litres.

#### Willsoon’s Position

31     Willsoon’s position is that the capacity issue is not a genuine one as this alleged defect was not raised in Star Group’s letter of demand of 4 May 2017 and not pleaded in the original Defence and Counterclaim. Willsoon’s explanation as to why the tank capacity is only 14,000 litres is that this is for safety reasons. In their pleadings, Willsoon also says that this safety reason was accepted by Star Group and that Star Group is therefore no longer entitled to raise this defect.

32     Willsoon further submits that the capacity issue is also a red herring as the water tank’s capacity is at the recommended water volume of 12,000 litres as stated in the Sales Quotation[^40]. It is also submitted that based on the specifications of the truck procured by Star Group, the recommended water volume for the water tank is 12,000 litres.

#### Star Group’s Position

33     Star Group’s position is that as the Combi that Willsoon had procured did not contain a “Debris Tank and Water Tank combined into one tank” of a size of 15,000 litres, Willsoon is in prima facie breach of the agreement. Star Group also says that Star Group has never agreed to a variation of the Sales Quotation in respect of the Combi’s tank capacity. Star Group submits that by virtue of this breach, they are entitled to reject the Combi and to rescind the agreement.

#### My Decision

34     The evidence shows that Willsoon’s Rafael first surfaced the capacity issue on 24 September 2016[^41] by way of an email to Star Group’s Simon Lim. In that email, Rafael stated, “_Tank has to be 14,000 lit_” and explained that, “_1.The engine area size has been increased because it is essential to leave space for technicians to safely carry out maintenance near the engine area. This way you will also have some space to place your equipment. 2. For the tank to be 15,000 lit it will be 8.9m long which exceeds the truck total length by 0.4m. 3. Note that you are still able to Jet blast for about 45 mins or more with 14,000 lit of water._”

35     The evidence shows that even though there was no acceptance of this change after the email of 24 September 2016 was sent, Willsoon nonetheless proceeded to procure a combi unit with tank capacity of 14 litres[^42] from the Chinese supplier for the building of the Combi on 26 September 2016. The Purchase Order of 7 October 2016 also shows that the Combi was built with a tank of 14,000 litres in capacity and not 15,000 litres capacity[^43].

36     Thereafter, from the email chaser sent by Willsoon to Star Group dated 24 October 2016[^44] and Star Group’s email reply dated 25 October 2016[^45], it is clear to me that Star Group did not accept the variation of the reduced tank capacity from 15,000 litres to 14,000 litres. This led to another email from Willsoon on 1 November 2016[^46], reiterating the reasons why the tank capacity could not be 15,000 litres; this time round, the explanation was accompanied by drawings. This resulted in Star Group’s response[^47] as follows:

> _“The case being as it is now, what choice do we have now but to accept? Please advise._

> _We think you should have done a proper calculation before representing to us the water tank can hold 15,000 litres of water._

> _A contract, once signed, is full and final._

> _However, we will deal with this unilateral variation in totality. This means we will see the final product first before deciding what redress to take.”_

37     The evidence thus shows that Star Group did not unequivocally accept Willsoon’s variation; Star Group’s conditional “acceptance” was subject to the final product being acceptable. At trial, Willsoon’s Rafael accepted that there was no agreement for the variation of the tank capacity from 15,000 litres to 14,000 litres.

> Q.    I'm going to put it to you that Star Group's position is that there was no agreement to change the tank size from 15,000 litres to 14,000 litres. Agree or disagree?

> A.    Agree.[^48]

38     Therefore, prima facie, Willsoon has breached the agreement in supplying the Combi with a tank capacity of 14,000 litres instead of 15,000 litres.

39     Having said that, however, the evidence shows that the truck procured by Star Group could not have accommodated a water tank of 15,000 litres capacity and as explained by Willsoon’s Rafael, supplying a water tank of 15,000 litres would render the Combi unsafe to use. I also note that the tank capacity issue was not listed as one of the issues in Star Group’s email to Willsoon listing the issues with regard to the Combi after the first testing session.

40     Further, the capacity issue was also not raised in Star Group’s letter of demand of 4 May 2017, whether as an issue under “initial flaws” or as an issue under “further flaws”.

41     The fact is also that the capacity issue was not originally part of the pleaded case of Star Group. All of these go to show that the capacity issue was an afterthought. This also goes to show that, even if it did not comply with the specification in the Sales Quotation, this issue did not pose a serious defect. Other than the non-conformance with the specifications in relation to the water tank capacity and Star Group’s non-acceptance of the change, there is no evidence that the capacity issue renders the Combi defective in any way. More importantly, there is no evidence to show that this non-conformance with the specifications would render the Combi so defective as to substantially deprive Star Group of the benefit of having the Combi.

### Other Defects and Whether the Combi was unfit for purpose and in breach of section 14(3) SOGA or of unsatisfactory condition and in breach of section 14(2), 14(2A), 14(2B) SOGA

42     Star Group relies on Section 14(3) of the SOGA and contends that the Combi was unfit for purpose. The particular purpose of the Combi was that was made known to Willsoon, i.e., – for the Combi to carry out sewer cleaning and desilting works under Star Group’s contract with PUB. The basis for Star Group’s contention is the various alleged defects they have pointed out. In addition to the 4-inch valve issue, the tank capacity issue, the other alleged defects pointed out by Star Group are:

> a.    The Vacuum Hose issue[^49]

> b.    Relocation of the Control Systems[^50]

> c.    The High Pressure Gun Issue[^51]

> d.    The Belt Tensioner Request[^52]

> e.    The Alleged Overload Valve Issue[^53]

> f.    The Alleged Release Valve Issue[^54]

> g.    Water Issue

> h.    Overheating Issue

> i.    Meter Issue

42     As regards these alleged defects, Star Group relies solely on the evidence of their witness, Simon Lim. I note that Simon is not an expert with specialised knowledge of the workings and technical specifications of Combis. At trial, he readily agreed that he is not involved in carrying out any of the desilting works and that this is the first time that Star Group is carrying out desilting works for PUB using a Combi[^55].

> “Q    So, Mr. Lim, let’s go through it for the 3rd time. This was the first time Star Group was using a combi to carry out desilting works for PUB, agree?

> A    Agree.”

43     When it was put to Simon Lim that no one from Star Group was in a position to comment on the Combi’s fitness, Simon pointed to Mr Srinivasan Sivaraman as the main person in charge of carrying out desilting works and who had some technical knowledge about the Combi[^56]. However, Star Group chose to withdraw this important witness at the last minute and the trial proceeded without the benefit of his evidence. In fact, these alleged defects or issues that were raised in the letter of demand of 4 May 2017 were no longer being pursued for the purpose of defending the suit as the trial progressed.

44     Therefore, overall, other than bare allegations, Star Group has not adduced any reliable evidence to substantiate their case that the alleged defects render the Combi unfit for purpose.

45     Nevertheless, for completeness, I will proceed to deal briefly with each of the other alleged defects in turn.

### Vacuum hose issue

46     The vacuum hose issue relates to the length and placement of the Combi’s vacuum hose. According to Willsoon’s Rafael’s affidavit of evidence in chief, this issue does not go to the function of the Combi. The Combi’s cylinder could be tipped for discharge of sludge or debris when the vacuum hose was detached from the vacuum tank. As for the alleged “_difficulties_” which Star Group says its workers would face due to alleged prohibitions imposed by “_NEA/PUB_”, I find no evidence in support of this allegation and that this is merely an unsupported bare allegation.

### Relocation of the control system

47     In relation to the location of the control systems, again, this has no bearing on the Combi’s fitness as the Combi could still function normally regardless of whether the controls were built on the right or left-hand side. Star Group’s contention that this would “_pose a significant danger_” to their employees who would be exposed to traffic while operating the Combi is based on their bare allegation that “combi machines are typically operated on the left-most lanes” and that public road sewers are located on the left side of roads. However, Star Group has adduced no evidence whatsoever in support of this. Neither has Star Group adduced any expert evidence to show why having the control system on the right side would pose dangers to workers working on the Combi as alleged by Star Group. More importantly, the requirement to locate the control systems on the left is not in the specifications or Sales Quotation. In any event, the drawings attached to the Sales Quotation and sent to Star Group’s Simon Lim on 1 November 2016 clearly show the control panels to be on the right side of the Combi and this was approved without any issue raised with regard thereto[^57].

### High-pressure gun issue

48     In relation to the high-pressure gun issue, Rafael testified that this did not affect the Combi’s fitness as the high-pressure gun was merely a secondary attachment that drew water from the main water tank for small area cleaning purposes. The main function of the Combi simply did not require the usage of the high-pressure gun. Again, Star Group did not adduce any evidence to show how and why they say this issue renders the Combi unfit for purpose.

49     Star Group also contends that the Combi “_vibrated excessively when being operated_”. However, even assuming the Combi does vibrate “excessively”, Star Group has not shown why vibrations rendered the Combi unfit for purpose. This is in contrast to Willsoon’s position that the vibrations were not excessive and which is corroborated by the testimony of Zhang Pengyi (“Zhang”) who was present at the 1st Testing Session. Zhang testified that “_the vibration will not affect the…operation of the Combi_” and that it was “_not so serious_”[^58].

### Overload valve leaking issue

50     In relation to the alleged overload valve leaking issue, Willsoon’s Rafael explained that the Combi’s overload valve functions as a safety feature that releases water to relieve pressure in the high-pressure pump. This occurs once the said pressure exceeds the maximum limit (which is adjustable)[^59]. Similarly, as I have found for the other alleged defects, Star Group has not adduced any evidence to show why the alleged overload valve issue would render the Combi unfit for purpose.

### Release valve issue

51     As for alleged release valve issue, Willsoon’s position, which is unchallenged, is that an automatic release valve was not included in the specifications. In any event, there were two release valves installed in the Combi which could be actuated manually (by buttons) or automatically (by pressure). Therefore, again, there is no evidence as to how this issue would affect the Combi’s functions at all.

### 2,000 litres of water cannot be used

52     In relation to this issue, Star Group contends that they were unable to utilise 2,000 litres of water due to the vertical configuration of the Combi’s water filter. This resulted in 2000 litres of water out of the total capacity of 14,000 litres that cannot be used. On this, again, Star Group did not adduce any evidence to show that this issue rendered the Combi unfit for purpose. Furthermore, even taking Star Group’s position at its highest, the water issue merely made the Combi “_too inefficient_”[^60] and not that the Combi is unfit for purpose. Furthermore, even discounting the 2,000 litres that cannot be used, the Combi is still able to provide the recommended volume of 12,000 litres of water.

### Overheating issue

53     It is not disputed that the Combi displayed some overheating issues during the 3rd Testing Session on 6 April 2017. Willsoon’s position is that the overheating had occurred as the Combi was made to operate for two hours, which was longer than its recommended usage time. In any event, Star Group has not adduced any evidence to show that the overheating issue shows that the Combi was unfit for use. Be that as it may, according to Willsoon and this is unchallenged, the overheating issue has been resolved by way of the installation of a cooling fan and therefore, this issue no longer exists.

### Meter issue

54     As for the meter issue, Star Group sought to show that the volt meter and the oil press meter was not working during the 4th Testing Session on 20 April 2017. Although Star Group alluded to the volt meter’s “_particular importance_” in the Combi, there is no evidence which shows that the Combi is therefore unfit for purpose. Rafael’s evidence on this issue is clear – the meter issue was only a technical issue (_because the switch that connected the volt meter to the display was not switched on_) that did not affect the overall function and performance of the Combi[^61]. Zhang who testified that the meter issue “_was a simple technical issue and did not affect the overall performance of the Combi_” further corroborated this_.[^62]_

### Whether the Combi was of satisfactory quality

55     The applicable statutory provisions under Sections 14(2A) and 14(2B) of the SOGA provide as follows:

> **Implied terms about quality or fitness**

> …

> (2A) For the purposes of this Act, _goods are of satisfactory quality if they meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory, taking account of any description of the goods, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances_.

> (2B) For the purposes of this Act, the quality of goods includes their state and condition and the following (among others) are in appropriate cases aspects of the quality of goods:

>> (a)    fitness for all the purposes for which goods of the kinds in question are commonly supplied;

>> (b)    appearance and finish;

>> (c)    freedom from minor defects;

>> (d)    safety; and

>> (e)    durability.

56     The assessment of satisfactory quality is an objective one to be undertaken from the viewpoint of a reasonable person, who is placed in the position of the buyer and armed with his knowledge of the transaction and its background. In _National Foods Ltd v Pars Ram Brothers (Pte) Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 1048</span> (“National Foods”), the court held that it is the party who alleges that the goods are not of satisfactory quality that bears the burden of proving the same[^63].

57     Star Group therefore has the burden to prove that the Combi was not of satisfactory quality, taking into account the descriptions and the price. Other than the tank capacity issue and the 4-inch valve issue, the other defects have not been shown to be contrary to the descriptions in the Sale Quotation. Price is also a relevant factor. Willsoon says that the contract sum for the Combi, which was fixed at S$220,000 is substantially lower than what Star Group would have had to pay for a European-made combi (approximately S$800,000). This can be found in Rafael’s communication to Simon on 20 September 2016 shortly after the Contract was signed:

> “_…Just to let you know that $220k is a fair price quote for your required specs and something equivalent in the market in Singapore would cost up to $800k that is because your specifications are on the higher end side._

> _The equivalent bare High pressure stainless steel pump alone would cost $80k here. The standalone engine drive would cost about $130k here. That is not including vacuum pump and the fully stainless steel vacuum tank with hydraulics system, skid, materials, manpower, assembly, warranty, shipping, boom, Hose Reel, Hoses, System Controls, etc…_”

58     Willsoon says that Star Group knew that it would cost Star Group a lot more if they had gone for a European manufacturer. Taking into consideration the much lower price that Star Group contracted for the Combi and given that Star Group has not shown how the defects render the Combi to be of unsatisfactory quality given the price, I conclude that Star Group has not shown that the Combi is of unsatisfactory quality.

59     Therefore, overall, there is no evidence whatsoever to show that the alleged defects exist. Even if I were to find that the alleged defects have been established, there is no evidence whatsoever to show that the alleged defects render the Combi unfit for purpose or is of an unsatisfactory quality.

### Delay issue

60     I will now deal with the issue of the delay in delivering the Combi. The Sales Quotation states under “REMARKS”, “DELIVERY LEAD TIME: 12-13 Working Weeks”.[^64]

#### Willsoon’s Position

61     Willsoon’s position is that “12-13 Working Weeks” is to be differentiated from “calendar weeks” in that this term would exclude weekends and public holidays. By this definition, one working week is 7 working days and that based on this, the expected delivery date of the Combi would be on or around 26 January 2017.[^65] As a result, Willsoon’s position is that there was no delay in the delivery of the Combi as the Combi arrived in Singapore on 6 January 2017.

#### Star Group’s Position

62     Star Group’s position is that under the agreement, the Combi was to be delivered to Star Group by 17 December 2016 at the latest[^66] but the Combi arrived in Singapore only on 6 January 2017. Further, all the defects led to the non-delivery of the Combi until as late as May 2017 by which time Star Group had accepted the repudiation by Willsoon and rejected the Combi.

#### My Decision

63     An examination of the evidence shows that as early as 8 December 2016, Star Group had started asking about “the status of the Combi” and was expecting that the Combi should be on its way to Singapore[^67]. Arising from this expectation, Star Group had also contacted by email their supplier of the truck on which the Combi was to be mounted to inform them that the Combi would arrive in Singapore on 17 December 2016. This email was also copied to Willsoon[^68]. If, as stated by Willsoon, it was that Star Group’s calculation of 12-13 working weeks was wrong which made their expectation that the Combi would arrive in Singapore by 17 December 2017 being incorrect, it is telling that Willsoon did not correct that wrong expectation or impression. I note that right up till 14 December 2016[^69], Star Group was still chasing for an update on the delivery date of the Combi. And in their email of 14 December 2016 sent to Willsoon, Star Group clearly stated that the “_Combi is supposed to arrive in Singapore on 17 December 2016_.”[^70]

64     I also note that the emails sent by Star Group to Willsoon on 6 December, 9 December requesting for an update as to the status of the delivery date of the Combi generated no response from Willsoon. Again, if Star Group’s understanding of “12-13 working weeks” was wrong, Willsoon made no attempt to correct it.

65     Therefore, the only inference to be made from all of this is that it was always the understanding between the parties that the Combi was to be delivered by 17 December 2017 or thereabout, based on the stated delivery time of 12-13 weeks. This inference can also be drawn from Star Group’s statement that “_Dave was supposed to update me/us if there are any changes with regards to the delivery date of the Combi_”[^71] which generated no response from Willsoon until Willsoon’s email of 22 December 2016.

66     Therefore, overall, Willsoon’s explanation in their affidavit of evidence in chief filed for the purposes of the trial that a working week is 7 working days is unsupported by evidence and appears to be nothing but an afterthought.

67     In the circumstances, the Combi was to have been delivered by 17 December 2016 or thereabout and the delay in the delivery of the Combi is clearly a breach of the term of the agreement.

### Is Star Group entitled to reject the Combi because of the delay?

68     Therefore, Willsoon has definitely breached the term of the agreement as regards the delivery of the Combi. The question that I need to answer is whether this breach entitles Star Group to reject the Combi and terminate the “agreement”. The law on this is as stated in _RDC Concrete Pte Ltd v Sato Kogyo (S) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 413</span> (“_RDC Concrete_”) in which the Court of Appeal at \[90\] stated as follows:

> “90    Turning to the first issue, it is important to note, at the outset, that, in the event of a breach of contract, there is no automatic legal right conferred on the innocent party to the contract (viz, the party who is not in breach of contract) to elect to treat the contract as discharged (i.e., to terminate the contract). The circumstances under which such a party is entitled to elect to terminate the contract at common law depends on which particular situation exists. These situations (shorn of more specific and difficult legal issues, as well as special rules with respect to certain specific types of contracts) can be classified into two broad categories. The first broad category is clear and comprises one situation only. The second comprises three situations, the last two of which (whilst distinct) may (depending on the precise facts of the case at hand) conflict with each other. The two broad categories as well as the specific situations therein may be summarised as follows:

>> (A)    WHERE THE CONTRACT CLEARLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY PROVIDES FOR THE EVENT OR EVENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE INNOCENT PARTY IS ENTITLED TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT

> 91………

>> (B)    WHERE THE CONTRACT DOES NOT CLEARLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY PROVIDE FOR THE EVENT OR EVENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE INNOCENT PARTY IS ENTITLED TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACT”

69     In our case, category (B) applies as the “agreement” clearly does not provide for the events pursuant to which Star Group is entitled to terminate the “agreement”, in particular, the “agreement” does not provide that Star Group is entitled to terminate the “agreement” in the event that the Combi was not delivered within the delivery date. As for this category, the Court of Appeal in _RDC Concrete_ at \[92\] outlines the 3 possible situations (category 2, categories 3(A) and 3(B) respectively) under which the innocent party may elect to terminate. Of the 3 possible situations, only categories 3(A) and 3(B) are relevant in the factual scenario of this case.

70     In a category 3(A) situation, the focus is on the nature of the term breached and, in particular, whether the intention of the parties to the contract was to designate that term as one that is so important that any breach, regardless of the actual consequences of such a breach, would entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract.[^72] In such a breach, the term that has been breached is considered to be a “condition” in the agreement. In a category 3(B) breach, the focus is not on the nature of the term breached but on the nature and consequences of the breach. If the breach gives rise to an event, which will deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit, which it was intended that he should obtain from the contract, then the innocent party is entitled to terminate the contract[^73].

71     The Court of Appeal stressed that, “_(i)n determining whether an innocent party is entitled to terminate a contract upon breach, the foremost consideration is (and must be) to give effect to the intentions of the contracting parties.”[^74]_ Star Group argues that the delivery deadline is a material term of the “agreement” as it is “well established that the times for delivery in a commercial sales contract are generally regarded as conditions”[^75]. However, Star Group was unable to point to contemporaneous evidence of communications between the parties showing that this was the intention of the parties.

72     A review of the term as regards delivery shows that the “delivery lead time” is stated to be “12-13 Working Weeks”[^76]. No specific date was stated in the agreement. There are also the following terms:

> “Acceptance” of the Equipment shall be deemed to occur on the date when, in the reasonable opinion of Buyer, the Equipment conforms to the Specifications, and has continuously operated in compliance with the Specifications for thirty (30) days after Equipment Delivery. Willsoon F.E. Pte Ltd shall present Buyer with a Final Certificate of Acceptance.”[^77] And

> “The above quotation does not include costs of installation on-site/on-vehicle, product training, test certificates, and etc, unless otherwise stated.”[^78]

73     The inference that can be drawn from reading all of these terms together is that both parties had clearly intended for “delivery” and “acceptance” of the Combi to be two separate things. After the “delivery” of the Combi that was to be built in accordance with the specifications in the Sales Quotation, the Combi was intended to be mounted on a truck and the Combi was to be tested for conformance to the agreed specifications before acceptance by Star Group. In this connection, it is clear that the “delivery lead time” is not the essence of the “agreement” because it is anticipated that after delivery, there would be further tests on the Combi. The delivery lead-time is therefore clearly not intended to be a condition of the agreement.

74     The available evidence also does not show that the delivery lead-time was intended by the parties to be a condition. On 23 December 2016, when Willsoon informed Star Group that the Combi was to depart from the Shanghai port on 27 December 2016 and the estimated “sailing time” from China to Singapore was “8-10 days”, Star Group did not point out to Willsoon that the proposed time frame was in breach of the condition of the “agreement”[^79]. In fact, Star Group followed up with an email on 6 January 2017 inquiring about the status of the combi with the question, “No delay right?”[^80] and Willsoon responded by stating that the Combi had arrived at Willsoon’s workshop that very morning[^81]. The evidence therefore does not show that parties intended for the delivery lead-time to be a “condition”. In fact, the evidence shows that Star Group did not even consider the “late” delivery of the physical Combi to be an issue.

75     As I have already mentioned, the evidence shows that it was always parties’ intention for the “Combi” to be shipped to Singapore first and then to be mounted on to a truck before testing the Combi. In this regard, I also find that parties intended for the Combi to be tested and further “fine-tuned” after the “delivery”.

76     It is not disputed that after the “delivery” of the Combi, there was delay in the acceptance of the Combi arising from the three testing sessions. The next question to answer is whether this “delay”, which comprises a delay in the delivery of the Combi and a delay in the acceptance of the Combi, is a breach that substantially deprives Star Group of the benefit which was intended for Star Group to obtain from the “agreement” (category 3(B) breach). On this question, I consider the fact that Star Group had entered into this “agreement” with Willsoon to build this Combi for the purpose of carrying out works under their PUB Contract. Thus, the entire benefit of the “agreement” for Star Group was for the Combi to be supplied to Star Group in order that Star Group could meet its obligations under the PUB Contract. Star Group had refused to accept delivery as at 20 April 2017. As the Combi was never used by Star Group to carry out its obligations under the PUB Contract, there is no evidence whatsoever in support of the case that Star Group was unable to meet its obligations under the PUB Contract with the Combi built by Willsoon.

77     On 17 February 2017, Star Group informed Willsoon - “_While we agree to your request of 5 weeks, we put in writing now that we will rent a Combi from the market to do our jobs. The rental costs we will claim from Willsoon. You have a choice now whether you would like to go and search and rent a Combi for our temporary use or we rent one our self.”[^82]_ From this, it is clear that the delay did not cause Star Group to be unable to perform its obligations under the PUB Contract. It merely meant that they had to find an alternative in the meantime. Even so, Star Group has not adduced any evidence to show how the delay had affected its obligations under the PUB Contract. There is no dispute that the PUB Contract that Star Group had remained intact until the end of the contract. In any event, I note that Star Group’s obligations under the PUB Contract started even before they contracted with Willsoon to build the Combi.

78     As the PUB Contract was to be until 14 August 2019, as at 4 May 2017 when Star Group informed Willsoon that they would deem Willsoon as having repudiated the contract for which they accept and that the contract was therefore deemed to be terminated, there was still a period of slightly more than 2 years and 3 months. Taking into consideration the fact that Star Group’s obligations under the PUB Contract was for 3 years and the fact that the contract with Willsoon was after Star Group’s obligations under the PUB Contract had already kicked in, that Star Group had been deprived of the use of the Combi for a few months can hardly be considered as a substantial deprivation of the benefit under the contract.

79     I have already made my finding that Star Group has not proven on a balance of probabilities that the Combi was unfit for purpose or was of unsatisfactory quality by virtue of the alleged defects or non-conformance with the specifications. Therefore, Star Group has not been able to justify their unilateral non-acceptance of the Combi or deliberate delay in accepting the Combi. I further find that Star Group has not shown that the delay in the delivery and the subsequent delay arising from Star Group’s non-acceptance of the Combi had substantially deprived Star Group of the benefit under the “agreement” as there was still a substantial period of time under the PUB Contract for Star Group to use the said Combi built by Willsoon.

80     Based on the above findings, I therefore find that Star Group has not established that the delay, albeit a breach, is a breach that entitles Star Group to terminate the “agreement” and refuse acceptance of the Combi. The correct approach towards Willsoon’s delay in delivering a fully working Combi was for Star Group to accept the Combi and sue Willsoon for the damages or loss suffered arising from the delay. The damages and losses would be in the form of rental costs of an alternative Combi to perform its obligations under the PUB Contract or the loss of income or profit under the PUB Contract arising from such delay. Star Group is not entitled to terminate the agreement and refuse acceptance of the Combi.

### Willsoon’s Claim for modification costs

81     Willsoon is also claiming for modification costs amounting to $42,072.75 arising from modifications done to the Combi on 14 February 2017 (amounting to $30,644.45), 21 March 2017 (amounting to $5733.60), and 6 April 2017 ($5,694.70).

82     While Willsoon, through their witness, Rafael, has given an explanation on how the costs of the modifications were arrived at, Willsoon has not adduced any cogent evidence in support of their claim for costs of modifications in that Rafael was unable to clearly explain how the modifications costs were calculated. Further, at no time did Willsoon issue any invoice to Star Group as regards these modifications[^83]. Most importantly, Willsoon has not explained the contractual basis for which they are claiming for these modification costs. There is no evidence whatsoever to show that there was any discussion and agreement between the parties as regards the modifications and the costs thereto. In fact, Willsoon had referred to these “modifications” works done to the Combi as “rectifications”[^84]. Thus, clearly, at the material time, these “modifications works” were for the purpose of rectifying the alleged “defects” that had been raised by Star Group. They were enhancements or further customisation works done pursuant to further negotiations and agreement between the parties.

83     As Willsoon has not shown that there was an agreement between both parties for these modifications to be chargeable and that the additional costs for the modifications had been agreed between the parties, Willsoon is not entitled to their claim for costs of the modifications.

84     Accordingly, Willsoon’s claim for modification costs cannot be allowed.

### Star Group’s counterclaim

85     By virtue of my findings that Star Group is not entitled to reject the Combi and treat the “agreement” as discharged, it follows that Star Group’s counterclaim cannot be allowed. For completeness, I further find as follows:

> (i)     There is no basis for Star Group’s counterclaim for a refund of 50% of the deposit paid to Willsoon.

> (ii)     As the Combi ought to have been accepted by Star Group, there is also no basis for Star Group to claim for the forfeiture of $10,000 that was placed with Triangle Auto as a deposit for the purchase of the truck.

> (iii)     There is no basis for the counterclaim for costs incurred in hiring a replacement Combi for the entire duration of the PUB Contract.

> (iv)     Star Group has claimed for loss of profit at $22,000 on a net monthly profits basis but has not adduced any evidence whatsoever to justify this claim on the basis of the relevant period of losses due to the delay in delivering a working Combi by Willsoon. Star Group has not quantified their losses based on Willsoon’s breach by virtue of the delay in delivering a working Combi as their position has always been that they were entitled to reject the Combi.

## Conclusion

86     In conclusion, Willsoon’s claim against Star Group for the balance sum of $125,400 remaining unpaid for the Combi is allowed. Willsoon’s claim against Star Group for modifications costs of the Combi is dismissed. Star Group’s counterclaim against Willsoon is also dismissed. Willsoon shall deliver the Combi to Star Group’s designated premises with 7 days from the date of full payment by Star Group. For this action, Star Group shall also pay costs to Willsoon and such costs are to be taxed, if not agreed.

87     Willsoon also sought to enforce a contractual term which allows them to charge late payment interest at the rate of 1% per month on remaining unpaid sums and as this has been clearly pleaded and prayed for[^85], I will also allow interest at 1% per month on the sum of $125,400 from the date of writ to 16 January 2020 (date of judgment).
