### District Judge Hamidah Bte Ibrahim:

The accused, Appu Sanujamol, female, an Indian national, aged 33, faces 6 charges of harassment on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender known as “Alex”, under section 28(2)(a) read with section 28(3)(b)(i) of the Moneylenders Act, Cap 188 Rev Ed 2010 (MLA). She pleaded guilty to 3 of these charges.

2       The brief particulars of the 3 charges are as follows:

> a)     DAC-922111-2019: On 23 July 2019, between about 8.40 p.m. and 8.49 p.m., at Block xx Teck Whye Lane #xx-xxx, Singapore, she did commit an act likely to cause annoyance to one Ang Ah Kee, occupant of the said flat, in connection with the loan to the borrower Tan Wie Jian, and in committing the said act caused damage by splashing yellow paint at the said flat and scribbling “x#xx xxx TAN xxx WHATSAPP xxx” with a black marker on the wall along the corridor ;

> b)     DAC-922734-2019: On 23 July 2019, between about 4.48 p.m. and 4.58 p.m., at Block xx Commonwealth Close #xx-xxx, Singapore, she did commit an act likely to cause annoyance to one Sebastian Alexander, occupant of the said flat, in connection with the loan to an unknown borrower, and in committing the said act caused damage by splashing yellow paint at the said flat and scribbling “xx#xxx xxx Whatsapp Alex” with a black marker on the wall along the corridor of the said flat;

> c)     DAC-932101-2019: On 26 July 2019, between about 6 p.m. and 6.07 p.m., at Block xx Punggol Field #xx-xx, Singapore, did commit an act likely to cause annoyance to Hu Qingjun, occupant of the said flat, in connection with the loan to the said Hu Qingjun, and in committing the said act caused damage by splashing red paint at the said flat.

3       The remaining 3 charges were taken into consideration (TIC) upon her conviction for the purposes of sentencing after the accused admitted to them and gave her consent. The accused was sentenced to serve 14 months imprisonment per charge, with 2 terms of imprisonment ordered to run consecutively, making it a total of 28 months imprisonment.

4       The accused is appealing against her sentence.

## Statement of the Facts (SOF)

5       The material portions of the SOF, which the accused admitted without any qualification, is as follows.

#### Background of the Offences

6       Sometime in June 2019, the accused borrowed money from an unlicensed moneylender (“UML”) known as “Alex”.

7       Sometime in July 2019, as the accused failed to make repayment to “Alex”, “Alex” suggested that the accused ‘work’ for him as a runner to harass debtors at their residences in return for offsetting the accused’s debts. The accused agreed to this arrangement and complied with “Alex’s” instructions to commit multiple acts of harassment on “Alex’s” behalf. After committing each act of harassment, the accused would send a video of her harassment to “Alex” as proof that she has complied with his instructions.

#### Facts pertaining to the 1st Charge \[DAC-922111-2019\]

8       The accused, on 23 July 2019, between about 8.40 p.m. and 8.49 p.m., at Block xx Teck Whye Lane #xx-xxx, Singapore, while acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender known as “Alex”, committed an act likely to cause annoyance to one Ang Ah Kee, occupant of the said flat, in connection with the loan to the borrower Tan Wie Jian who used to reside in that address. In the course of committing the said act, the accused caused damage to the said flat by splashing yellow paint at the said flat and scribbling “xx#xx xxx TAN WIE JIAN WHATSAPP xxx” with a black marker on the wall along the corridor of the said flat.

13     The accused, on 26 July 2019, between about 6 p.m. and 6.07 p.m., at Block xx Punggol Field #xx-xx, Singapore, while acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender known as “Alex”, committed an act likely to cause annoyance to Hu Qingjun, occupant of the said flat, in connection with the loan to the borrower, the said Hu Qingjun. In the course of committing the said act, the accused caused damage to certain property by splashing red paint at the said flat’s door and gate.

15     Hu Qingjun has spent at least $150 to remedy the said defacement.

## The Sentence

16     In this case, the accused who is a first offender, has been convicted of three counts of harassment on behalf of Alex, an unlicensed moneylender, which is an offence punishable under s 28(2)(a) read with s 28(3)(b)(i) of the MLA. The prescribed penalty for this offence is mandatory imprisonment for a period not exceeding 5 years and the accused is also liable to a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $50,000. If damage is caused in the course of committing the offences, the offender shall also be punished with a mandatory minimum 3 strokes of the cane and not more than 6 strokes of the cane. Caning is not applicable here as the accused is a female.

17     The prosecution, in their address on sentence, citing the case of _PP v Nelson Jeyaraj s/o Chandran_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1130</span>, which established the benchmark sentence of 12 months imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for harassment offences, per charge, which do not involve fire, sought an uplift of another 2 months imprisonment in lieu of caning. This would result in a sentence of 14 months imprisonment and with 2 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively as required under the Criminal Procedure Code, the global position would be 28 months imprisonment. The accused in her mitigation plea pleaded for leniency. In addition, she cited her personal circumstances in India where she has a 10 year old daughter to support and her father was ill. She explained that she had borrowed from the unlicensed moneylender as she had debts to settle owing to family circumstances and was threatened by the unlicensed moneylender.

18     I was inclined to agree with the prosecution that there are aggravating factors which do not warrant any departure from the benchmark sentence. Firstly, general deterrence and retribution must be the dominant sentencing principles. The prescribed mandatory imprisonment terms and caning meted out to offenders, even first timers, who commit harassment offences against debtors spelt out under the Moneylenders Act clearly reflect Parliament’s intention to strongly deter such offences. The need for deterrence in dealing with such offences have been repeatedly endorsed by the courts: _PP v Nelson Jeyaraj s/o Chandran_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 2 SLR 1130</span> (at \[20\]-\[23\]_); PP v Quek Li Hao_ \[2013\] 4 SLR (at \[22\]); _Ng Teng Yi Melvin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 1165</span> (at \[13\]).

19     Acts of harassment associated with unlicensed moneylending undoubtedly compromise public safety and security. Persons, like the accused, who act as harassers play a critical role in perpetuating loanshark activities and a strong stance must be taken against such offenders.

20     Turning back to the facts of this case, it bears emphasis to reiterate that the accused has actually committed a total of 6 acts of harassment. In 2 of the instances of harassment, namely DAC 922111/2019 and DAC 927151/2019, the flats where she harassed were actually occupied by innocent victims, i.e the non debtors. It was held in the case of _PP v Quek Li Hao_, that it was an aggravating factor when innocent persons were deliberately targeted and harassed, for instance, by harassing the debtor’s neighbours or vandalizing premises when the debtor no longer resided and that such offenders in fact ought to be given a term of imprisonment of 2 to 3 months higher than the benchmark sentence: at \[39\] and \[44\]

21     In so far as the imprisonment term in lieu of caning was concerned, I was referred to the case of _Amin bin Abdullah v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 904</span>, (at \[90\]), where the court provided indicative guidelines for the in-lieu of caning imprisonment term. The accused here is avoiding 3 strokes of the cane for each proceeded charge. For avoiding 1 to 6 strokes of the cane, the indicative guideline in the _Amin’s case_ stated that the imprisonment term is up to 3 months. The 2 months proposed by the prosecution is therefore appropriate and with this uplift, it would result in 14 months’ imprisonment for each proceeded charge. Considering too the fact that there were 3 other similar charges which were TIC with the accused’s consent, an uplift from the norm would also be justified since it is trite law that, if there are TIC offences to be taken into account, the effect, in general, would be that the sentence which the court would otherwise have imposed for the offences proceeded with would be increased, especially so, in a case like this, where all the offences were of the same kind. Where the mitigating factors are concerned, I accept that the plea of guilt must be given some weight.

22     All considered, I impose a term of 14 months imprisonment per charge and ordered 2 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively, making it a total of 28 months imprisonment. The sentence was backdated to 2 August 2019 when she was first remanded.

23     The accused, being dissatisfied, has now appealed against the sentence. She is presently serving her sentence.
