### District Judge Chee Min Ping:

## Introduction

1       On 18 March 2019, Mr Loh pleaded guilty to two charges:

(a)     C1 - one charge of driving a motor vehicle while a third party risks insurance policy was not in force, an offence under s 3(1), punishable under s 3(2) and s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“Motor Vehicles Act”), and

(b)     C2 – one charge of using a motor vehicle as a public service vehicle (taxi) without a valid licence under s 101(1) punishable under s 101(2) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed) (“Road Traffic Act”).

Mr Loh was convicted on both charges. Two other charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

2       For the commission of C1, Mr Loh was sentenced to a fine of $600. Mr Loh was also disqualified for 12 months from holding and obtaining a driving licence for the offence. For the commission of C2, Mr Loh was sentenced to a fine of $1000. Mr Loh requested for an instalment payment plan as he required time to pay the aggregate fine of $1,600 in full. The application to pay by instalments was granted.

## Charges

3       Proceedings for C1 were initiated on 5 December 2016 by way of a summons to attend court. C1 reads as follows:

\[You\] are charged that you, on 16 July 2016, at about 3.29 am, did use a motor car bearing registration number SGK8467T as a public service vehicle (taxi) along Sentosa Gateway whilst there was not in force in relation to the user of the said vehicle, such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks & Compensation) Act… and you have thereby contravened section 3(1) of the said Act which is an offence punishable under section 3(2) and 3(3) of the said Act.

4       C2 reads as follows:

\[You\] are charged that you, on 16 July 2016, at about 3.29 am, did use a motor car bearing registration number SGK8467T as a public service vehicle (taxi) along Sentosa Gateway without there being in force, in respect of the said motor car, a valid licence issued under Part V of the Road Traffic Act… authorising such use, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 101(1) punishable under Section 101(2) of the said Act.

## Statement of Facts and Conviction

5       Mr Loh admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts, and the material facts are stated as follows. On 15 July 2016 at about 10.30 pm, Land Transport Authority (“LTA”) officers began conduct of an operation concerning “illegal street hail activities” by private hire cars along Sentosa Gateway, in front of St James Power Station. On 16 July 2016 at about 3.15 am, an LTA officer walked past the motor car bearing registration number SGK8467T (“Car”) driven by Mr Loh which was waiting in a queue with taxis for passengers. There were two “Taxi” signs displayed prominently inside the Car. Mr Loh wound down the Car window and asked the LTA officer if he was looking for a taxi, and the LTA officer replied that he was going to Clementi. Mr Loh asked the LTA officer to board the Car, which the latter did at 3.29 am on the same day.

6       Mr Loh then informed the LTA officer that the fare would be $18 in cash. Mr Loh was wearing dark coloured clothing, a cap and a mask at the material time. Mr Loh proceeded to drive the Car to Clementi. During the trip, Mr Loh gave his mobile number to the LTA officer, and informed the latter to address Mr Loh as “Taxi Uncle” for future bookings so that Mr Loh would know that the booking was made by a regular customer. Mr Loh then collected $18 from the LTA officer as payment for the trip.

7       Investigations revealed that the Car was registered as a private hire car which was not allowed to ply for hire on the road. The Car was rented from Lion City Rentals Pte Ltd at the material time for provision of transportation services by an Uber driver. The Car was insured with ERGO Insurance Pte Ltd from 25 February 2016 to 24 February 2018 on condition that the use for carriage of passengers was in connection with the policyholder’s business as an Uber driver. Investigations also revealed that while Mr Loh was registered as an Uber driver since 30 December 2015, his Uber account was suspended by Uber on 3 May 2016. Since Mr Loh was no longer an Uber driver at the material time and had used the Car as a taxi, ERGO Insurance Pte Ltd informed that the insurance policy was no longer valid.

8       Given \[5\] – \[7\] above, Mr Loh had on 16 July 2016 at about 3.29 am used the Car as a public service vehicle, and while there was no policy of insurance in respect of third party risks that complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles Act in force. Mr Loh was accordingly convicted on C1 and C2.

## Charges Taken Into Consideration for Sentencing

9       Mr Loh admitted and consented to having two other charges taken into consideration for sentencing, and they are:

(a)     C3 – Plying, at the material time, the Car, for hire along the road in front of Sentosa Gateway in front of St James Power Station in contravention of rule 40(1) of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Rules (Cap 276, R14, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Rules”), an offence under s 131(1) punishable under s 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act.

(b)     C4 – Displaying an advertisement inside the Car at the material time, of two “Taxi” signs without prior written approval, in contravention of rule 66 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Rules, an offence under s 131(1) punishable under s 131(2) of the Road Traffic Act.

## Antecedents

10     Mr Loh did not have any similar antecedents.

## Applicable Law

### Punishment and disqualification relating to C1

11     In respect of C1, the punishment and disqualification was to be imposed in accordance with s 3(2) and (3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, which provides that:

(2)    If a person acts in contravention of this section, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or both.

(3)    A person convicted of an offence under this section shall (unless the court for **special reasons** thinks fit to order otherwise and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification) be disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) for a period of 12 months from the date of the conviction.

\[emphasis in bold\]

12     The effect of s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act is that a disqualification of 12 months (or for a longer period) from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act, _shall_ be imposed unless the court “thinks fit to order otherwise” for “special reasons”. In _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v Public Prosecutor_ at \[22\], it was held that it did not necessarily follow that if “special reasons” exist, a disqualification period would not be imposed. The court must separately consider whether it ought to exercise of its discretion in favour of the offender. The court ought then to determine if the circumstances were so exceptional that the non-imposition of the disqualification period on the offender would not defeat the underlying objectives s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act (_Siti Hajar bte Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ at \[8\]).

13     The meaning of “special reasons” is well established in case law. In _Muhammad Faizal bin Rahim v Public Prosecutor_ (“_Muhammad Faizal_”) at \[28\] – \[44\] (and more recently in _Prathib s/o M Balan v Public Prosecutor_ at \[11\]), the High Court clarified that “special reasons” has a narrow meaning, which allows consideration of only reasons connected to an offence, but not those which related to an offender. This is due to the underlying policy intent of s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, which aims to prevent road users and/or their dependents from being potentially left with no compensation in the event of damage or injury sustained in a traffic accident caused by an uninsured driver. Thus, the contravention of s 3(1) is viewed as a serious offence, which is reflected in a possible jail term (s 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act) and mandatory disqualification of 12 months (s 3(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act).

### Punishment relating to C2

14     In respect of C2, the maximum punishment provided under s 101(2) of the Road Traffic Act is a fine not exceeding $3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.

## Sentence

15     The prosecution informed the court that it is not making any specific submission on sentence. In relation to C2, the prosecution informed the court that the fines usually meted out for such offences range from $1,000 to $1,500.

16     Mr Loh was unrepresented. He indicated his remorse and requested for the court’s leniency.

17     In view of Mr Loh’s lack of antecedents, lack of circumstances indicating high culpability, and the sentencing regimes for the offences in C1 and C2 respectively, I was of the view that the individual fines of $600 and $1,000 respectively were not manifestly excessive, and in line with the fines usually imposed for similar offences. Particularly in relation to C1, there were no facts or submissions placed before me by the parties for the purposes of showing that there were any special reasons that justify the non-imposition of a 12 months’ disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence.

18     I was also of the view that the aggregate sentence of a fine of $1,600 and 12 months’ disqualification from holding a driving licence was in line with Mr Loh’s overall culpability. I took into account that there were two other charges taken into consideration for sentencing (C3 an C4). However, I did not place significant weight on these two charges given that they arise out of the same conduct and events with which C2 was concerned and were considered in determining the appropriate sentence for C2.

## Conclusion

19     In the circumstances, Mr Loh was sentenced to an aggregate fine of $1,600 and 12 months’ disqualification from holding and obtaining a driving licence, with effect from 18 March 2019.
