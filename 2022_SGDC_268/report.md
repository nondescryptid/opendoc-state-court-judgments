### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 37-year-old male Bangladeshi, was alleged to have committed sexual offences against two intellectually disabled female persons:

> a)     V1, a then 39-year-old female; and

> b)     V2, a then 27-year-old female.

> (collectively “the alleged victims”)

2       The offences were alleged to have occurred on two dates in November 2018. The accused faced a total of six charges as a result. These were:

> a)     Four charges of outrage of modesty under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) involving V1;

> b)     One charge of digital penetration under section 376(3) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) involving V1; and

> c)     One charge of outrage of modesty under section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) involving V2.

4       The accused claimed trial to all six charges. With the consent of the Defence, the Prosecution proceeded on a joint trial against the accused.

5       In the course of the trial, the Prosecution produced medical reports put up by two psychiatrists from the Institute of Mental Health (“**IMH**”) who had separately examined the alleged victims. In those reports, the psychiatrists, PW6 Dr Chai Suet Bin (“**Dr Chai**”) who had examined V1, and PW2 Dr Joseph Leong Jern-Yi (“**Dr Leong**”) who had examined V2, had separately opined that the alleged victims are intellectually disabled (see P5, P6 and P7). Further, in the case of V1, Dr Chai had opined that V1 was not fit to testify in court, while for V2, Dr Leong had opined that that she was highly unlikely to be able to follow normal court proceedings due to her disability.

6       In the same reports, the examining psychiatrists had opined that the alleged victims did not have the capacity to consent to the sexual acts allegedly committed against them. Specifically:

> a)     For V1, Dr Chai had opined at \[19\] of P7 that: “Based on my observation and findings, I am also of the opinion that she does not have the mental capacity to give consent to sexual acts.”

> b)     For V2, Dr Leong had opined at \[3\] of P6 that: “Due to her significant impairments and deficits in language and speech, she is highly unlikely to appreciate the significance of sexual acts, much less give consent to sexual acts.”. He also stated at \[4\] of P6 that: “ In my opinion, \[V2\] does not have the mental capacity to give consent to sexual acts.”

7       At the end of the Prosecution’s case, as there was sufficient evidence to make out every element of the charges, I called on the accused to enter his defence. The accused chose to testify and was the only witness for the Defence.

8       After examining the notes of evidence (NE), the exhibits, and the detailed submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence, including the relevant propositions of law helpfully set out, as well as the cases and legislative provisions identified and applied by parties, I was of the view that there was sufficient evidence to prove the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt on all six charges, and I convicted him accordingly. Thereafter, following sentencing submissions from the Prosecution and the Defence’s mitigation plea, I imposed a global sentence of 9 years and 24 months’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.

9       The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. He is serving his sentence pending the hearing of the appeal. I now give my detailed grounds of decision.

## Elements of the Charges

10     The charges against the accused are reproduced below:

> MAC-911920-2018 (1st charge): Involving V1

> You…. are charged that you, on 18/11/2018, at around 8pm, at the open space outside McDonald’s at Woodlands Civic Centre, Singapore did use criminal force to one, \[V1\], Female 39 years old, to wit, by kissing her cheek and lips, hugging her and touching her breasts and back, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage her modesty and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> MAC-904916-2019 (2nd charge): Involving V1

> You…. are charged that you, on 18/11/2018, at around 9pm, at the steps in front of Blk 340 Woodlands Avenue 1, beside the carpark, Singapore did use criminal force to one, \[V1\], Female 39 years old, to wit, by kissing her lips, hugging her and touching her breasts, back and thighs, knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage her modesty and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC-931781-2018 (3rd charge): Involving V1

> DAC-931782-2018 (4th charge): Involving V1

> DAC-931783-2018 (5th charge): Involving V1

> You… are charged that you, on 24/11/2018 sometime after 7.30pm, at the railing near the construction site at Marsiling Park, did sexually penetrate with your two fingers, the vagina of one \[V1\], Female, 39 years old, without her consent, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 376(2)(a) and punishable under Section 376(3) of the of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC-931784-2018 (6th charge): Involving V2

11     The relevant offence provisions of the Penal Code read:

> Assault or use of criminal force to a person with intent to outrage modesty

> 354.—(1)    Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage the modesty of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

> Sexual assault by penetration

> 376.—(2)    Any person (A) who – (a) sexually penetrates, with a part of A’s body (other than A’s penis) or anything else, the vagina or anus, as the case may be, of another person (B)… shall be guilty of an offence if B did not consent to the penetration.

>> (3)    Subject to subsection (4), a person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 20 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning.

12     For the outrage of modesty charge under s 354(1) of the Penal Code, the Prosecution is required to prove for the following:

> a)     The accused had used criminal force on the alleged victims in the manner described in the respective charges; and

> b)     The accused knew it to be likely that he would thereby outrage the modesty of the alleged victims.

13     As for the sexual assault by penetration charge under s 376(2)(_a_) punishable under s 376(3) of the Penal Code, the Prosecution has to prove that:

> a)     The accused sexually penetrated V1’s vagina with his two fingers; and

> b)     V1 was incapable of consenting or did not consent to the accused’s act.

## Summary of the Prosecution’s case and facts essentially not in dispute

14     In presenting its case, the Prosecution called a total of ten witnesses for the entire trial. These witnesses did not include the two alleged victims as the Prosecution had taken the position that they were not fit to testify in court, following the expert reports put up by the psychiatrists.

15     The Prosecution witnesses who did testify were two psychiatrists and two psychologists who had examined the alleged victims, witnesses who know and who are familiar with the alleged victims, and witnesses who had dealt with the accused in the course of investigations. I will set out aspects of the relevant witnesses’ evidence at a later part of these Grounds of Decision, when discussing the main issues of the case.

16     In addition to the evidence from the Prosecution witnesses, two statements from the accused, recorded from him under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Chapter 68 (“CPC”), were admitted into evidence without challenge from the Defence.

### Facts essentially not in dispute

17     The Prosecution highlighted that the following facts were undisputed: [\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

> a)     On the dates of the alleged offences, V1 was 39 years old and V2 was 27 years old.

> b)     On 18 November 2018, in the evening, the accused met V1 at a bus stop near Blk 334 Woodlands Street 32, Singapore, and got on the same bus with her to travel to Woodlands Interchange. After alighting from the bus, he asked V1 for directions.

> c)     Sometime later, the accused brought V1 to have a meal and then to the open space outside the McDonald’s located at Woodlands Civic Centre, Singapore. There, at about 8.00p.m., the accused kissed V1’s cheek and lips, hugged her and touched her breasts and back.

> d)     Later, the accused brought V1 to the steps in front of Blk 340 Woodlands Avenue 1, beside the carpark, Singapore. There, at about 9.00p.m., the accused kissed V1’s lips, hugged her and touched her breasts, back and thighs.

> e)     Sometime between 18 and 24 November 2018, the accused told V1 that he wanted two girlfriends. Consequently, V1 introduced V2 to the accused.

> f)     On 24 November 2018, in the late afternoon, the accused met V1 and they proceeded to V2’s HDB block located at Yishun, where V2 met the accused and V1 at the ground floor of her block. The trio then proceeded to the pavilion with benches in front of Blk 243 Yishun Ring Road, Singapore. There, the accused then gave V1 some money to buy him a drink. After V1 left, at about 5.00p.m., the accused hugged V2, touched her shoulders, face and thighs and kissed her cheeks and lips.

> g)     At about 7.30p.m., the accused brought V1 to Marsiling Park and they first headed to a bench along the river. There, the accused kissed V1 on her left cheek and lips. Subsequently, the accused and V1 went to the railing near the construction site at Marsiling Park, where the accused penetrated V1’s vagina with two of his fingers for about three to four seconds. The accused used his right hand and touched V1’s breasts over her clothes. The accused received a topless photo of V2 by 27 November 2018.

> h)     In the morning of 7 December 2018, the accused met V1’s sister-in-law (“**PW8**”) and PW8’s elder son, both of whom confronted the accused about his relationship with V1. PW8’s son also recorded their conversation.

### General Outline

18     The Prosecution’s case can be summarised as follows: [\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

> a)     On 18 November 2018, after the accused had met V1 by chance, and on the pretext of being friendly to her, he proceeded to buy V1 dinner, before he outraged her modesty twice, despite having reasonable grounds to believe that she had no capacity to consent to his actions. Thereafter, not satisfied with having just one “girlfriend”, he then told V1 to introduce him to a friend, whereupon she introduced V2 to him.

> b)     On 24 November 2018, on the pretext of celebrating V1’s birthday, the accused had met V1 at a pavilion near V2’s house, where he outraged the modesty of both V1 and V2. On the same date, at Marsiling Park, the accused outraged the modesty of V1 again, and also sexually penetrated her vagina with his fingers.

> c)     The Prosecution’s case was that the alleged victims are suffering from moderate intellectual disability. Further, the evidence from the examining psychiatrists and psychologists from the IMH show that:

>> (i)       The alleged victims would not have had the mental capacity to consent to the acts particularised in the charges; and

>> (ii)       A normal-functioning adult (like the accused) would have realised within 10 minutes of his interaction with the alleged victims that they are not normal-functioning adults despite physically appearing to be adult women.

> d)     Accordingly, the Prosecution argued that the accused was at all material times aware that the alleged victims were intellectually disabled, and that accordingly, any purported consent they may have given was not valid consent. The Prosecution also referred to admissions that the accused had made to PW8, who was V1’s sister-in-law, which were recorded by the latter, and argued that these showed the accused to have been aware of V1’s mental limitations.

> e)     As for the acts referred to in the various charges which constituted the _actus reus_ of the offences, the Prosecution essentially relied on admissions made by the accused in his statements that the specific acts had been committed against V1 and V2 and argued that these admissions should be relied on.

> f)     Finally, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s self-serving accounts in court were internally and externally inconsistent, and that they were incredible and could not be believed.

## Outline of the Defence’s case

19     The accused was represented by various lawyers throughout the trial, namely Mr Dhanwant Singh, Mr Charles Yeo, Mr Foo Ho Chew, and Mr Mohan Singh. I set out below the main aspects of the accused’s testimony, before summarising the main arguments put up by the Defence at the end of the trial.

20     Amongst other things, the accused’s testimony appeared to suggest that the alleged victims spoke, behaved and appeared “normal” to him, and that they liked and/or loved him at the material time. Further, as regards the offences, the accused claimed that the alleged victims had initiated or consented to the various forms of physical body contact that he had with them.

21     I have summarised the main aspects of his evidence below:

> a)     The accused testified that in 2018, he was working for CT Elevator Private Limited. His work permit expired on 7th December 2018, and he was due to fly back to Bangladesh on 9th December 2018. Two weeks prior to his intended departure, he met V1 at a bus stop at Woodlands, and the latter smiled at him. They then took the same bus and alighted at the bus interchange.

> b)     The accused claimed that V1 was smiling at him continuously and even told him that she likes him. Thereafter, the accused said to V1 that he would follow her to her intended destination at “Valueshop”. On the way there, V1 said that she would eat with him at McDonald’s. The accused said that she subsequently gave him her phone number and also told him her name, while he informed her that he was “Wali”. The accused said that V1 spoke to him in English and claimed that she “looks normal” to him and was also “talking normally”.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

> c)     The accused also claimed that V1 subsequently held his hand when they were walking back from the Woodlands Civic Centre, and also said to him that she did not mind the fact that he was married with children. Further, when they were near to V1’s house, she had told him that she wants to love him if he was agreeable, and then allegedly kissed him on his left arm, before he kissed her on her forehead. Subsequently, after they separated, V1 had allegedly called him several times that same night, and told him that she loved him, and also sent him emojis of love and of kissing.[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5)

> d)     The accused further said that V1 called him saying that she was willing to meet him, and also said that her friend \[V2\] wanted to meet him. This was said through a WhatsApp video call. The accused said that he spoke to V2 during the same videocall, and V2 also spoke to him “normally”. The accused claimed that V2 then made a subsequent video call to him, and also exchanged phone calls and added him on Facebook. The accused also repeated his claim, made in his statement P3, that V2 likes and loves him. Further, the accused said that V2 did not want him to keep a relationship with V1, and wanted to be in a relationship with him instead. In addition, the accused claimed that subsequently, both V1 and V2 called him saying that they loved him and liked him.

> e)     The accused said that on 24 November 2018, both V1 and V2 had contacted him and invited him to celebrate V1’s birthday, at a place near to V2’s house. While he did not initially agree to go, he subsequently said that he would meet them. The accused said that later that day, he met V1 on a bus on the way to V2’s house. The accused said that V1 sat next to him, smiled at him, held his hand, kissed him on his arm and placed her head on his shoulder. The accused claimed that he felt nervous and shy as there were many people on the bus.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)

> f)     Subsequently, V1 and the accused met V2 at a pavilion near the latter’s house. The accused said that on that occasion, there was actually no preparation for a birthday celebration, but the alleged victims wanted to meet him as they liked him. He then gave V1 money to buy drinks for them, leaving him alone with V2. The latter repeated that she loved him, and also allegedly hugged him and kissed him on the shoulder and forehead. He reciprocated by kissing her on the forehead and hugging her. While the accused admitted that he touched V2 on her thighs, he denied touching her breasts. He also said that both he and V2 kissed each other on the lips.

> g)     Later V1 returned with the drinks. After about 15 or 20 minutes, V2 said that she had to go home as her mother was calling her. The accused claimed that following this, both V1 and he went to Marsiling MRT, where V1 suggested said that they eat at a McDonald’s near Marsiling Park as she didn’t want to go home but wanted to spend time with him. He said that V1 even took a photo of him when they were at Marsiling Park. The accused also confirmed as correct his answer given in P3 Q4A4, that V1 had kissed him on his right cheek, and that he kissed V1 on her left cheek, but said that he did not touch her. He further said that V1 did not show resistance when they kissed and hugged.

> h)     The accused also confirmed as correct his answer in P3 Q5A5 that they subsequently walked past the railing near the construction site where they kissed each other on the lips and hugged. He further claimed that V1 touched his penis with her hand, and also guided his hand into her underwear where he inserted two of his fingers into her vagina. Later, V1 left for home and so did the accused.

> i)     The accused alleged that later on the same night, he had spoken to V2 who said to him that she liked him and wanted to marry him. Despite telling her that he was married and has children, he claimed that V2 said to him that as long as he was in Singapore, she wanted to maintain a relationship with him.

22     As regards the Defence’s submissions made at the end of the trial, counsel argued that the alleged victims did not display any obvious signs of “…inherent deficiencies of Mental Incapacity”[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7). The Defence also criticised the evidence of the IMH psychiatrists and argued that:“…the doctors have miserably failed to state that their advanced learning or specialization renders them experts in understanding the emotionalism or sexual maturity of the ladies…”[^8]. Further, counsel took issue with the fact that the psychiatrists had not been provided with the police statements recorded from the alleged victims.[^9] In addition, Mr Charles Yeo, for the accused, argued that the behaviour of the alleged victims was such that the accused, who was “…not highly educated or experienced with the ways of women and even credited to suspiciously take advantage of women did he know or had reason to believe or even suspect that something was amiss on those occasions such that it may be said that he was not cognizant that the lady was a child unawares of being touched or abused.”[^10].

23     The Defence also submitted that it was for the Prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that when the accused indulged in the intimate or sexual acts, he “… knew that the ladies were so mentally incapacitated that any contacts with them amounted to usage of criminal force outraging their modesty or that their consent was no consent.”[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

24     Finally, the Defence took issue with the fact that the alleged victims did not testify, especially since they had “…in fact given clear statements on their interactions with the Accused.” [\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12)

## Issues before the Court

25     In line with the elements of the charges, and the respective Prosecution and Defence cases, the main issues before the court were as follows:

> a)     Whether the _actus reus_ of the offences were made out i.e. whether the alleged sexual acts, had occurred on 18 and 24 November 2018 as set out in the charges; and

> b)     Whether there was consent given by the alleged victims to the alleged sexual acts.

26     Linked to the primary issue of consent, were the following secondary issues that had to be determined, namely:

> a)     Whether the alleged victims had the capacity to provide valid consent to the acts in the charges given their intellectual disability; and

> b)     If not, whether the accused had mistakenly believed in good faith that the alleged victims had consented to these acts.

27     For completeness, in these grounds of decision, I will also address the issue concerning the absence of testimony from the alleged victims, and discuss how, if at all, this has a bearing on whether the Prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

## The actus reus was established from the accused’s admissions

28     In this particular case, the alleged victims did not testify in court. Neither were there eyewitnesses to the events.

29     As for the statements of the alleged victims which were provided by the Prosecution to the Defence after a ruling by this court, these statements were subsequently admitted by the Defence as exhibits, pursuant to the Evidence Act, (Chapter 97, 1997 Revised Edition). However, in light of the evidence of the recording officer about the mental conditions of the alleged victims and their responses during the recording process, as well as the amount of involvement and assistance needed in order to elicit their answers (due to the mental state of the alleged victims), out of an abundance of caution, I was of the view that the alleged victims’ statements could not be safely relied on in deciding the issues of the case. This was so even though the statements did, _prima facie_, appear to provide information as to the offences allegedly committed by the accused against the alleged victims. In deciding the issue of guilt, I also did not consider the contents of the alleged victims’ statements – in particularly the parts of their statements that implicated the accused – since the latter did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the alleged victims in court.

30     For completeness, I would add that the position I took vis-à-vis the alleged victims’ statements, appeared to be largely consistent with the position stance by the Prosecution. Specifically, the Prosecution also did not refer to the contents of the alleged victims’ statements that implicated the accused, in establishing its case against the accused.

31     In light of the above, and as there were no third-party eyewitness to the events, the Prosecution essentially relied on the accused’s statements to prove the _actus reus_ of the offences. For convenience, I will set out in a tabular form the parts of the accused’s statement that are relevant for each of the six charges.

32     It can be seen from the above extracts, that the accused had admitted to the acts alleged in the charges, and he did so, in his two statements given to the recorder, where the questions and answers were interpreted by a freelance Bengali interpreter, PW3 Abdul Ahad (“**Mr Ahad**”), who also testified in court.

33     I further note that the statements (P2 and P3) were recorded on separate dates, 8 December 2018 and 14 December 2018 respectively i.e. 6 days apart, and that they were signed by the accused, the interpreter and the recorder. Based on the evidence of the recorder, PW1 ASP Shermeen Ong (“**ASP Ong”**), and the Bengali interpreter, Mr Ahad, it was clear that the statements of the accused had been recorded in a systematic manner, and the accused was given a chance to make amendments to the statements.

34     Further, based on the testimonies of the Prosecution witnesses, no complaint was made by the accused in connection with the recording of the statements, nor was any request made by the accused. In addition, Mr Ahad, the interpreter, had described the accused as normal during the statement recording; specifically, the accused did not appear frightened or fearful, nor did he raise any issue before, during or after the recording of the statement. The accused also did not have any problem communicating with Mr Ahad or understanding him. In addition, there was no allegation made by the accused that the statements were involuntary, nor any reason provided to suggest that they were inaccurate.

35     All in all, having assessed the evidence surrounding the recording of the accused’s statement, it was clear that the relevant safeguards and procedures for recording had been adopted. There was also no reason to doubt the evidence of ASP Ong and Mr Ahad as regards the accuracy of the recording, or the fact that the accused was allowed to say what he wanted to say. Further, there was nothing put forward to suggest that ASP Ong or Mr Ahad even knew the accused beforehand, let alone that they would fabricate evidence, or treat the accused in an unfair or unobjective manner in the statement recording process.

36     While the accused did make the claim _in court_ that his statement P2 was only partially true, as he was under great stress at the time of the recording, and the accused claimed, again _in court_, that in his later statement P3, he had made corrections to correct “the lies” he had allegedly stated in P2, I note that in P3, the accused did not actually say that P2 contained lies. The furthest the accused actually went in P3 was to say that in P2, he “…did not reveal many things that \[V1\] did and \[he\] only focussed on what \[he\] did. (P3 Q13A13). Further, as could be seen from the table at \[31\] above, as regards the _actus reus_ of the offences, P3 itself contained many of the admissions that formed the subject matter of the charges against the accused.

37     Further, while the accused’s statements did contain features that were exculpatory or which downplayed his role, and the accused also alluded to alleged consensual behaviour on the part of the alleged victims, I would add that in assessing the contents of both P2 and P3, I was mindful of the guidance provided by the Court of Appeal in _Chan Kin Choi v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1991\] 1 SLR(R) 111</span>, that in respect of any mixed statement, both the incriminating and the exculpatory parts of a mixed statement should be considered by the trial judge in determining where the truth lay, although it would usually be the case that the incriminating parts were likely to be true whereas excuses would not carry the same weight: (see \[34\] and \[35\]).

38     Taking into account all relevant considerations, there was clearly no reason to doubt the accuracy of the contents of the P2 and P3, in particular the admissions made by the accused as to his commission of the _actus reus_ of the offences. These admissions were voluntarily made, and had been interpreted by an independent Bangladeshi interpreter and recorded by ASP Ong. Thus, as set out at \[31\] above, the accused’s statements showed, amongst other things, that he had deliberately and intentionally carried out the offending acts against the two alleged victims, on the dates, times and places reflected in the charges.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13)

## Whether there was any valid consent to the sexual acts

39     Having found that the _actus reus_ of the offences was established, I now consider whether the Prosecution has successfully proved the other elements of the charges. In this regard, the Prosecution also has to show that:

> a)     For the outrage of modesty charges, that the accused knew or intended that he would thereby outrage the modesty of V1 and V2. This which would entail a consideration of whether they had validly consented to his actions; and

> b)     For the sexual assault by penetration charge, whether there was any consent by V1 to the act of penetration by the accused.

40     In this regard, as the acts set out in the charges involved deliberate bodily contact and force used by the male accused on the alleged victims who were both female, and since the acts were clearly of a sexual nature (involving kissing one (or more) of the alleged victim on her lips and cheeks, touching her breasts, hugging and touching her thighs, inserting his fingers into her vagina etc.), the accused, who was married and had children of his own, would have known that he should not be committing these acts against V1 and V2, and that they would constitute offences if there was no valid consent from the alleged victims for these acts to be committed.

41     Thus, the issue of whether there was valid consent from the alleged victims was pivotal. This is the issue I will now be exploring. To this end, I will first set out the relevant legal principles pertaining to consent, before considering whether there was indeed valid consent from the alleged victims to the acts specified in the charges.

### The law on consent

42     Sections 87 and 90 of the Penal Code explain what amounts to consent.

43     Section 87 of the Penal Code provides that:

> 87 Nothing, which is not intended to cause death or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person above 18 years of age, who has given consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm.

44     Section 90 of the Penal Code further provides that:

> 90     A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code —

>> …

>> (b)     if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, **mental incapacity**, intoxication, or the influence of any drug or other substance, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent;

\[emphasis added\]

45     In _PP v Iryan bin Abdul Karim_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 2 SLR 15</span> (“**_Iryan_**”) at \[123\], the High Court accepted the following proposition on the concept of consent[^14]:

> …Consent on the part of a woman, as a defence to an allegation of rape, requires voluntary participation, not only after the exercise of intelligence, based on the knowledge of the significance and moral quality of the act, but after having freely exercised a choice between resistance and assent. Submission of her body under the influence of fear or terror is not consent. There is a difference between consent and submission. Every consent involves submission but the converse is not true. A woman is said to consent only when she freely agrees to submit herself, while in free and unconstrained possession of her physical and moral power to act in a manner she wanted. **_Consent implies the exercise of free and untrammelled right to forbid or withhold what is being consented to; it is always a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is proposed to be done by another and concurred in by the former_**.

\[emphasis added\]

46     In line with the decision in _Iryan_, the question as to whether there was valid consent by a victim to sexual activity depends on whether there was a voluntary and conscious acceptance by the victim as to what was being consented to.

47     The Court of Appeal in _Pram Nair v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 1015</span> (“**_Pram Nair (CA)_**”), a case dealing with allegations of rape and sexual assault by penetration, at \[93\] – \[94\], referred to the passage (see \[45\] above) in _Iryan_. The Court of Appeal also set out the following principles at \[96\]:

> 96    We would identify the following as the relevant general principles:

>> (a)    Under s 90(b), **_a person who is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which that person has allegedly given his consent has no capacity to consent._**

>> (b)    … Consent to sexual activity, even when made while intoxicated, is still consent as long as there is a voluntary and conscious acceptance of what is being done.

>> (c)    …

>> (d)    Capacity to consent requires the capacity to make decisions or choices. **_A person, though having limited awareness of what is happening, may have such impaired understanding or knowledge to lack the ability to make any decisions, much less the particular decision whether to have sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual act._**

>> (e)    In our view, expert evidence – such as that showing the complainant’s blood alcohol level – may assist the court in determining whether the complainant had the capacity to consent.

\[emphasis added\]

48     In _Pram Nair (CA)_, the victim was intoxicated and had blacked out. She woke up in the middle of the night to find the offender on top of her. The evidence was that she was last seen high, looking really drunk and unable to stand unsupported. This was about an hour and a half before she was raped and penetrated by the offender with his finger.

49     In the High Court ( see _PP v Pram Nair_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 880</span> (“**_Pram Nair (HC)_**”), Woo Bih Li J (“Woo J”) found that the victim had not consented to the digital or vaginal penetration actions that the accused had carried out on her but further stated that “even if the accused had asked the victim if she wanted to have sex and if she had said, “Yes”, (his Honour) would have concluded that her response is vitiated by s 90(b) of the Penal Code in view of her intoxicated state.” (see \[144\] of _Pram Nair (HC)_).

50     The Court of Appeal in _Pram Nair (CA)_ also made it clear at \[62\] that: “**Where the absence of consent is an element of an offence, and it is shown that the alleged victim was incapable of giving consent, then it would not matter whether she ostensibly did since such a consent would not be valid**. That is the effect of section 90(b) of the Penal Code.” (emphasis added)

51     In addition, in “Criminal Law in Singapore”[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15), at \[19.31\], when commenting on s 90(b), the authors opined that this clause “…simply requires the court to determine whether the degree of intoxication or the nature of the unsoundness of mind suffered by the victim at the time had the effect of preventing them from understanding what they were consenting to”.

52     The legal principles on consent were also considered by the High Court in _PP v Chong Chee Boon Kenneth and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] 5 SLR 1434</span> (“**_Kenneth Chong_**”). At \[40\], Justice See Kee Oon (“**See J**”) held that “…the essential elements which would make up valid consent are fundamentally similar irrespective of whether the court is dealing with sexual or non-sexual offences”. Further, See J made clear at \[40\] that in order for consent to operate as a complete defence, the Defence must satisfy the following threshold requirements “at the minimum”:

> (a)     **_There must be voluntary participation on the part of the “victim” after he/she had been able to appreciate the significance and the moral quality of the act proposed to be done_** (see _Pram Nair_ at \[93\]).

> (b)    There must be some element of agreement as to what is proposed to be done to the “victim”. In this regard, it is a question of fact whether there was an agreement, which can be implied or express and there is no requirement for any conventional contractual analysis. What is important is that the “victim” must know the nature of the act proposed to be done and the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the act (see _Balakrishnan_ at \[104\]– 105\]).

> (c)    There must not be any fact which calls into question whether consent was given voluntarily. **_In this regard, the presence of any of the vitiating factors in s 90 of the Penal Code would be prima facie evidence of a lack of voluntariness_**. It is also clear from the definition of “injury” in s 44 of the Penal Code, that “injury” for the purposes of s 90(a)(i) of the Penal Code would encompass any harm “illegally caused to any person, in body, mind, reputation or property” (see Yeo, Morgan & Chan at para 19.19).

\[emphasis added\]

### Assessing the capacity of the alleged victims to consent to the accused’s acts

53     In the present case, the Prosecution essentially led evidence from expert witnesses, as well as from witnesses who know and/or who are familiar with the alleged victims, to show that the alleged victims lacked the capacity to consent to the accused’s acts set out in the charges. I shall discuss the evidence below[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16).

#### Assessment by the psychiatrists and psychologists

##### (1)   V1’s psychiatric and psychological assessments

54     V1 was assessed by Dr Chai, a psychiatrist from IMH, who examined her on 14 May 2019 (approximately six months after the events set out in the charges). As summarised by the Prosecution, [\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) Dr Chai’s evidence was that:

> a)     V1 could speak in simple Mandarin, and usually in single words or short phrases of two to three words, and that V1 has “rather poor verbal ability”.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) Even speaking in simple English may be quite challenging, as she appears more proficient in Mandarin than English. Her inability to understand “quite a number of questions” and her slow responses all pointed to the conclusion that V1 has intellectual disability.[^19] Dr Chai estimated that V1 has moderate intellectual disability with an IQ of roughly 35 to 49,[^20] and that she has the mental age of around 10 years old.[^21]

> b)     When asked complex questions (such as whether V1 understood the nature and consequences of sexual acts), V1 could not fully comprehend and was sometimes not able to give an answer.[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) Dr Chai opined that there was a “strong possibility” that V1 simply could not answer such questions due to her intellectual disability.[^23]

> c)     As V1 was unable to relate to Dr Chai the nature and consequences of sexual acts, Dr Chai concluded that V1 did not have any mental capacity to give consent to sexual acts.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

55     It should be noted that Dr Chai’s assessment is consistent with the findings of PW9 Tan Yan Ling Michelle (“**Ms Tan**”), the Senior Clinical Psychologist at IMH, who had assessed V1 on 26 July 2019 (approximately eight months after the events reflected in the charges). In essence, Ms Tan testified that:

> a)     V1 was unable to discriminate between degrees of friendship, claiming that she has “100” best friends, which in turn, indicated that V1 has difficulties understanding the concept of social closeness.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

> b)     V1 could only converse in simple speech with short sentences containing less than 10 words in a phrase.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) Her command of Mandarin (despite being her preferred language) faced the same speech limitations as her command of English.

##### (2)   V2’s psychiatric and psychological assessment

56     Dr Leong from IMH examined V2 on 2 April 2019, 23 April 2019 and 28 May 2019 (approximately five to six months after the events referred to in the charges). Dr Leong’s evidence can be summarised as follows:

> a)     V2 was unable to speak properly and had to keep referring to her father, PW5, to help clarify Dr Leong’s questions.[\[note: 27\]](#Ftn_27) Also, V2 could not speak in full sentences (only managing two to three words in a phrase) and required a lot of prompting and cues. She also had to keep looking at PW5, who had to nod and suggest words to V2.[^28] Open-ended questions tended to draw a blank response from V2.[^29]

> b)     V2 was also unable to give details such as her NRIC, age and birthday.[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) Even after 74 minutes of interview time with Dr Leong, V2 still took time to warm up to him, and was observed to be very shy and did not want to talk.[^31] In addition, V2 could not remember Dr Leong until the third time that he assessed her.[^32] Dr Leong opined that V2 would have difficulty interacting with an adult,[^33] and also concluded that V2 is moderately intellectually disabled[^34], with the mental age of a child of around eight to 12 years old.[^35]

> c)     When Dr Leong tried to obtain an account from V2 as to what the accused did to her, the latter was very distressed when talking about the “brown man” (referring to the accused).[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) V2 informed Dr Leong that she tried to push the accused away when he touched her[^37], and demonstrated this action to Dr Leong by using both her palms (facing outwards) and making a pushing action.[^38] In addition, she had told the accused that she “don’t want”.[^39] Dr Leong thus inferred that V2 did not like the accused.[^40]

57     I would add that Dr Leong’s observations about V2’s condition are consistent with those of V2’s assessing psychologist, PW4 Leung Hoi Ting (“Mr Leung”), a clinical psychologist of 7 years who works at the IMH. Mr Leung gave the following testimony:

> a)     When Mr Leung explained the limits of confidentiality of her psychological assessment to V2, the latter gave a blank look, PW5 (V2’s father) had to re-explain some concepts to V2.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) Further, when Mr Leung asked V2 questions such as “What do you do” and “What are you working as”, V2 was unable to answer these on her own and PW5 had to step in to assist,[^42] and to prompt V2 to answer the question.[^43]

> b)     Even when V2 answered, her answers were unclear and irrelevant, and PW5 had to step in to answer on V2’s behalf.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) V2’s responses were also limited to one or two words.[^45]

#### Evidence of witnesses who dealt with or who were familiar with V1 and V2

58     The psychiatrists and psychologists had been specifically tasked to carry out forensic assessments/conduct tests of the alleged victims in relation to their intellectual disability, their mental capacity to give consent to the sexual acts, and also the fitness to testify in court. In coming up with their assessments and evidence, these experts had interacted with the alleged victims, and had also spoken to the caregivers and people who were familiar with them.

59     In the course of the trial, the Prosecution called some of the same caregivers/witnesses, and others who had dealt with the alleged victims, to testify in court. I summarise the main aspects of their evidence, in so far as such evidence was relevant for the issue of assessing their capacity to consent.

60     First, as regards ASP Ong who recorded statements from both V1 and V2, ASP Ong gave the following evidence:

> a)     She had recorded a statement from V1 on 26th December 2018 at about 2:05pm to 4.01pm in the presence of an appropriate adult. ASP Ong testified that V1 was able to recall how many times she met the accused and also the place that they first met. ASP Ong said that there were times where V1 refused to answer and ASP Ong had to probe further to elicit a reply from her. The appropriate adult was very useful in helping the victim understand the question posed by ASP Ong, who also said that the statement was obtained through a lot of probing and rephrasing. V1 provided answers in bits and pieces, similar to V2, and both of them could not form complete sentences.

> b)     In the case of V2, ASP Ong had recorded a statement from her on 12th December 2018 at about 2:36pm, at Woodlands Division, in the presence of an appropriate adult. ASP Ong testified that V2 didn’t really understand what the interview was about, so ASP Ong had to explain to her the reason for inviting her down. She said that V2 had difficulty expressing herself effectively, in verbalising and also in understanding her questions. ASP Ong said that she had to rephrase or repeat the same questions to V2 several times. ASP Ong also said that V2’s answers were in “bits and pieces”[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46), in that they were not in chronological order and ASP Ong had to ask her which came first, and what happened next. Further, ASP Ong had to summarise what V2 said, and V2 also gave wrong information about the location and day when the accused met her near her house. ASP Ong also said that: “For direct questions, I had to ask her and explain to her, and rephrase several times before I could get an answer from her. Sometimes her answers were irrelevant, so I have to direct her again to the question.” [^47]

> c)     ASP Ong said that in her view, both V1 and V2 were clearly mentally challenged. In the case of V2, she could see from her appearance that V2 doesn’t look normal and that she avoids eye contact. Further, from the way V2 spoke, it was very obvious that she could not pronounce words properly and she has difficulty verbalising and expressing herself. In the case of V1, she was less forthcoming when talking about the accused.

61     PW8, who is V1’s sister-in-law, has stayed with the latter since November 2008.

> a)     She explained that V1 had a high fever at the age of 3 years old, and she has Down Syndrome. V1 could not speak well, and was sent to the MINDS School so that someone could take care of her while PW8’s mother-in-law went to work. PW8 described V1 as not as normal, and that from one glance, you could tell that she was not normal from her facial expressions. PW8 said that V1 usually spoke in Mandarin, and that V1 could not really carry out a simple conversation in English, and could only answer yes and no, and string a sentence of less than ten words. When V1 spoke, she would also mumble and PW8 explained that “you really have to try to figure out what she’s trying to tell you”.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48)

> b)     PW8 also described V1 as being able to communicate well with PW8’s 3-year-old son, and they have to adapt their way of asking her as if she was a kid. If they were to talk to her like an adult, V1 would keep quiet and not want to answer.

62     PW5 is V2’s father.

> a)     PW5 testified that when V2 was born, she was a “blue baby”, and he and his wife had taken care of her after her discharge from the hospital. When she was 7 years old, the nursery refused to accept her because she was not mentally fit, and they subsequently enrolled her in MINDS school. V2 was subsequently enrolled in MINDS workshop when was 18 years old. PW5 described V2 as being normal externally, but that internally, she was not really normal as she does things very slowly, and she could not walk straight or steadily because her mind could not concentrate. V2 could probably string less than five words in a sentence, and these were not complete sentences. Neither could V2 carry out a conversation in English as she would use short forms. While PW5 was able to understand her, PW5 doubted that other people would understand what she wants. PW5 said that V2 also could not carry out a conversation in Mandarin as she could say a few sentences only.

> b)     PW5 testified that V2 could take care of herself and could do the housework, as this was taught to her by PW5’s wife. However, he said that V2 is not able to go out on her own, unless it is to a place that they had brought her before, and that she could only go the way that they had brought her. In fact, V2 could not go to MINDS shop by herself, and could only go by school bus.

> c)     As for using her handphone, PW5 said that V2 was only able to copy from what others sent her, and send out messages through WhatsApp like “where are you”, “where you going”, “come back”, “call me”. PW5 said that V2 was not able to type “Morning. How are you?”, and that he has never heard her type that before. Neither has he seen her use the word “Hello” in her text messages before. Further, V2 does she know how to spell the word “friend”, and could type below five words only, and not a whole sentence.

### Alleged victims lacked capacity to consent to sexual acts

63     In light of the overwhelming evidence tendered in court, and in light of the positions set out in the cases discussed above, I agreed with the Prosecution that the alleged victims lacked capacity to consent to the accused’s actions set out in the charges. I elaborate below.

64     First, the unequivocal, well-reasoned and amply supported views of the psychiatrists clearly pointed to the conclusion that the alleged victims lacked the capacity to consent to the sexual acts.

> a)     In essence, the psychiatrists had commented that where kissing, hugging, touching of shoulders, thighs and back were concerned, while these actions may not involve the intrusion of sexual organs _per se_, the alleged victims would not have been able to understand that these actions could be a prelude to getting into a romantic relationship or as a precursor to getting intimate with a man.[\[note: 49\]](#Ftn_49) Further, the alleged victims would also not have been able to understand acts which have sexual meaning or connotations (such as the touching of breasts).[^50]

> b)     In fact, it would not have mattered even if the accused had asked the alleged victims for their consent prior to committing the actions in the charges and the alleged victims had said “yes”, since they could not understand the nature and consequences of these acts and hence there would have been no valid consent.[\[note: 51\]](#Ftn_51)

> c)     Further, quite aside from the acts of outrage of modesty committed against V1 and V2 by the accused, where their consent would have been vitiated in light of their incapacity to consent, in the case of the additional charge of sexual assault by penetration involving V1 alone, she could similarly not have been able to consent to the accused’s actions, as she does not have any understanding of sexual acts and their consequences.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52)

65     I accepted the expert opinions expressed by the psychiatrists. In this regard, I was of the view that:

> a)     Their opinions and conclusions were based on clear and cogent analysis, following personal interactions and interviews with the alleged victims and their caregivers, the assessment of the facts of the case provided to them, and also supported by tests conducted by other professionals such as the psychologists involved.

> b)     Indeed, the psychiatrists, who had examined the alleged victims and the other evidence, had arrived at conclusions that are clearly sound. More importantly, consistent with the view of Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Kanagaratnam Nicholas Jens v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 887</span> (“**_Kanagaratnam_**”) at \[30\] that the psychiatrists had to explain the reasons for their conclusion, I note that the two psychiatrists, who had independently assessed the alleged victims, had given clear and cogent reasons for reaching their conclusions. They had also set out the comprehensive factual basis on which these conclusions were arrived at. I saw no reason to reject their opinions.

> c)     I further note that the psychiatric reports, where the psychiatrists had concluded that the alleged victims lacked the capacity to consent, were in fact provided to the Defence beforehand. Despite this, the Defence did not adduce any expert evidence to refute the evidence of these experts, nor was the Defence able to put forward any reason why the expert evidence led by the Prosecution should not be accepted.

> d)     For completeness, I would add that the assessments of the psychiatrists were also consistent with the evidence of the psychologists, as well as the observations of the family members of the alleged victims, and of the investigation officer who had interacted with both alleged victims. All of these lay witnesses had also given evidence of their own interactions with the alleged victims which clearly pointed to mental incapacity on the part of the alleged victims. That the evidence of these witnesses was able to withstand challenge by the Defence in court, also bolstered the conclusions separately reached by the psychiatrists of the mental deficiency of the alleged victims, and their incapacity to consent to the sexual offences committed by the accused against them.

66     All in all, I accepted the evidence of the IMH psychiatrists that owing to their mental disability of the alleged victims, they could thus not have understood the nature and consequence of the accused’s acts that he had carried out against them, and that they lacked the mental incapacity to consent to the various sexual acts that the accused had committed.

67     I would add that in any event, based on the observations of the experts, as well as evidence of the lay witnesses who were familiar with or who had interacted with the alleged victims, it seemed highly unlikely that the alleged victims would have behaved towards the accused in the manner that he suggested, as the alleged victims had clear limitations in their ability to speak English, and they did not appear to take to strangers as readily or as freely as the accused claimed. In other words, it was highly unbelievable the accused’s claims that the alleged victims had been so forward with him, or that they had largely “come on to him” rather than the other way round. In this regard, it was improbable that they had consented to the acts of a sexual nature that he had committed against them.

68     Further, even if I were to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused, and accepted his claim that the alleged victims had “consented to the sexual acts” committed by the accused, nonetheless, under section 90(b) of the Penal Code, their mental incapacity would have vitiated any consent that they may have given for such acts, such that any alleged consent on their part would not constitute valid consent. In other words, because the alleged victims were incapable of giving consent, then it would not matter whether \[they\] ostensibly did do so, since any such consent would not be valid in law. That is the effect of section 90(b) of the Penal Code.” (see _Pram Nair (CA)_ at \[62\])

69     Indeed, this position set out by the Court of Appeal in _Pram Nair (CA)_ was consistent with the decision of the trial judge (Justice Woo) expressed in _Pram Nair (HC)_, that even if the offender had asked the victim if she wanted to have sex and if she had said “_Yes_”, Woo J would have concluded that her response was vitiated by virtual of s 90(b) of the Penal Code.

70     Accordingly, in light of the mental condition of the alleged victims, it could also not be said that either of them had consented to the sexual acts committed by the accused against them, since their lack of understanding and intelligence, and their limited awareness and knowledge as to the significance and moral quality of the sexual nature and implications of the acts of the accused, as well as their inability to “know the nature of the act proposed to be done and the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the act” meant that there was in fact no voluntary or conscious acceptance, or any valid consent by the alleged victims of what the accused was doing to them (see _Iryan_ at \[123\], _Pram Nair_ (CA)at \[96\] and _Kenneth Chong_ at \[40\]).

71     I would add that a somewhat similar situation was encountered in the relatively recent Court of Appeal decision in _PP v GCK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK (CA)”)_. This case involved a 55-year-old female victim, who was allegedly molested by a health attendant at a nursing home. At first instance, the District Judge had convicted the offender after he accepted the evidence of the resident physician of the nursing home that the victim had significant cognitive impairment and was not fit to testify in court. Further, an IMH doctor had also certified that the victim _did not have the ability to give consent_ for the purposes under section 90(b) of the Penal Code, “very much likely” due to the complications arising from her strokes. When the case went before the Court of Appeal, following the filing of a criminal motion, the conviction of the offender by the District Judge was affirmed (see _GCK (CA)_)_._

72     In summary, for the present case, by virtue of s 90(b) of the Penal Code, and the legal propositions set out in the authorities discussed above, as well as the comprehensive and compelling evidence of the psychiatrists, fortified by the views and observations of the psychologists and of the other witnesses who were familiar with or who had interacted with the alleged victims, it was clear that not only did V1 and V2 not consent to the sexual acts, more importantly, they lacked the ability and capacity to consent, and hence there was no valid consent as regards the offences of outrage of modesty committed against both alleged victims, or as regards the offence of sexual assault by penetration against V1. In other words, the offences against the accused were made out.

## Whether defence of mistake of fact applies

73     I move on to the next major issue in this case, whether despite the absence of consent and/or valid consent on the part of the alleged victims, the accused would nonetheless be exonerated due to there being a valid defence of mistake that operated in his favour, ostensibly because he genuinely thought that the alleged victims had consented to his actions.

74     In this regard, as set out in “Criminal Law in Singapore”[\[note: 53\]](#Ftn_53), at \[19.44\], for an offender to avail himself of the defence of mistake under s 79 of the Penal Code, he would have to prove that (1) he made a mistake about consent of the victim(s); (2) that the mistake was made in good faith and that; (3) because of this mistake, he believed his actions were justified.

75     I will discuss these elements in greater detail below, and then consider if this defence is available to the accused.

### The law on the defence of mistake of fact

76     The defence of mistake under s 79 Penal Code operates as a complete defence. However, it has to be established by the Defence on a balance of probabilities (see _Pram Nair (CA)_ at \[110\]).

77     Section 79 provides:

> 79.    Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.

\[emphasis added\]

78     It is further provided under section 52 of the Penal Code that nothing is believed in good faith if it is believed without due care and attention.

79     In _PP v Tan Khee Wan Iris_ \[1994\] 1 SLR(R) 723 (“**_Iris Tan_**”), Yong Pung How CJ elaborated on the defence under s 79. His Honour stated:

> \[17\]  So far as the s 79 defence is concerned, s 107 of the Evidence Act still applies and the burden is on the appellant to show on a balance of probabilities that she acted under a mistake and by reason of that she believed in good faith that she had a valid licence for the relevant period.

> …

> \[19\]  … The test of whether a mistake was made in good faith is not whether the mistake was an easy one to make nor whether a reasonable person could make the mistake. The test is that laid down in s 52 of the Penal Code. The test is whether there was due care and attention. The mistake may be a natural one to make and it may be one which reasonable persons often make. Nevertheless, **_the defence is not made out unless it is shown on a balance of probabilities that the appellant exercised due care and attention_**.

\[emphasis added\]

80     In the recent case of _PP v Ridhaudin Ridhwan bin Bakri_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 105</span> (“**_Ridhaudin_**_”_), Woo Bih Li J summarised this defence as follows:

> \[123\] Therefore, for the defence of mistake of fact as to consent to succeed, it appears that the Defence must show on a balance of probabilities that:

>> (a)    there was sufficient cause for the relevant accused person to believe that the Complainant consented;

>> (b)    the accused had exercised due care and attention; and

>> (c)    the accused’s belief was in good faith.

### There was no mistake by accused about consent from the alleged victims

81     Having assessed the evidence, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was no basis to show that this defence operates to exonerate the accused, principally as the Defence had not shown any evidence, let alone establish on a balance of probabilities the necessary requirements (see \[80\]). Specifically, the Defence has failed to show that:

> a)     there was sufficient cause for the accused person to believe that either of the alleged victims had consented;

> b)     the accused had exercised due care and attention; and

> c)     the accused’s belief was in good faith.

82     Instead, in my view, the inference to be drawn from the totality of the evidence was that the accused had decided to take advantage of both the alleged victims’ mental incapacity, even though he would have known that both alleged victims were not able to give valid consent.

83     First, as rightly pointed out by the Prosecution, the accused has been working in Singapore for 11 years (as of the date of the offences), and had been a site supervisor for lift installation work, holding this supervisory role for two years and eight months.[\[note: 54\]](#Ftn_54) In light of the long period of time that he had spent in Singapore, he would have interacted with local Singaporeans in the course of work when dealing with projects throughout Singapore, spanning community centres, condominiums, corporate / office buildings and factories,[^55] and across places such as Woodlands, Ang Mo Kio and Tampines.[^56] It was also clear that in the course of his employment, he has spoken to his Indian workers and his Singaporean boss “Jack” in English,[^57] and also interacted with “Jack” through means such as text messages, and discussed matters pertaining to his work permit and employment in Singapore. In addition, the accused had discussed salary matters with an office manager named “Shirley”.[^58] Further, the accused, who shared his company residence with other senior workers from Bangladesh and China, would have at least have conversed in “basic English” with his housemates from China,[^59] and attended toolbox meetings where the language of instruction was English.[^60] On his off-days, he would likely also have conversed in English to various service staff, such as those he met when he visited the McDonald’s at Causeway Point.[^61]

84     In short, from his long period of stay and work in Singapore, and his interactions with various nationalities here including with Singaporeans, the accused would have been aware of how things work in Singapore. He would also be familiar with how “normal” adults behaved in Singapore, since he would have had numerous interactions with normal-functioning adults, including with his housemates, team members, his boss, his manager, and with the people that he purchases items from almost certainly on a daily basis. Under such circumstances, the accused would have known, within a short period of interaction with the alleged victims, that they _are not normal-functioning adults_.

85     Further, from the evidence given by witnesses during the trial who know and have interacted with the alleged victims, including ASP Ong, PW8 (V1’s sister-in-law), and PW5 (V2’s father), _it would have been obvious that the alleged victims are not normal functioning adults_. Further, the evidence showed that the alleged victims also had difficulties conversing in English, especially in speaking in full sentences, thus casting doubt on the claims made by the accused that they had spoken to him normally, and even made overtures and claims of love (in English) to him.

86     It should also be noted that the IMH psychiatrists and psychologists, who interacted and examined the alleged victims, stated that it would have been readily apparent to lay persons that both V1 and V2 are intellectually disabled.

87     Specifically, where V1 was concerned:

> a)     Dr Chai made it clear that “any usual or normal person” would be able to “guess or to know” that V1 was not normal in her intelligence by observing the way she behaves, her appearance and the way she responds.[\[note: 62\]](#Ftn_62) Further, Dr Chai opined that a person could discern this from V1’s appearance alone as V1 was “down looking” and sported a facial appearance which is “somewhat different from usual people”.[^63] Even if a person could not tell from V1’s appearance, Dr Chai’s expert opinion was that “within a few minutes of maybe about 10 minutes”, a person would be able to see from V1’s behaviour, i.e. her being slower in responses, and also not being able to give many verbal replies, that she is not of normal intelligence.[^64]

> b)     Further, Ms Tan, the senior clinical psychologist who had interviewed V1 and prepared a report dated 1st August 2019 (P22), also gave evidence that when one has an extended conversation with V1, it would become more apparent that based on V1’s responses that she is slower,[\[note: 65\]](#Ftn_65) and that a person of higher functioning would have been able to tell that V1 was slower and simpler. In Ms Tan’s view “…whether she can be taken advantage of, for example, depends on both parties.” [^66] In this regard, the accused, who has worked in Singapore for 11 years and held a supervisory role for more than two years of that time, and who was also someone who had interacted with various people of different nationalities, would no doubt be someone of higher functioning. He would thus have been aware that V1 was mentally challenged. This is especially so as he had long periods of interaction with V1 not only on 18 November 2018, but also on 24 November 2018.

88     As for V2:

> a)     Her psychiatrist, Dr Leong, had likewise testified that if a lay person engaged V2 in conversation, it would be apparent to that person that V2 suffers from intellectual disability. This was due to V2’s limited speech patterns in speaking in short phrases of at most three words, and the fact that V1 tends to gesture rather than explain or talk.[\[note: 67\]](#Ftn_67) While Dr Leong agreed that V2 may appear normal on first impression, a lay person would have noticed from V2’s short replies and long response time that she is not a normal-functioning adult.[^68]

> b)     Mr Leung, the clinical psychologist at IMH who carried out a forensic assessment of V2, had interviewed V2 in Mandarin and in simple English and by using gestures. This interview lasted for about 2 to 3 hours with V2’s father present for part of that interview. Mr Leung said that V2’s English was very basic, and she would answer in short sentences of less than 10 words. Further, V2 was not very expressive and required a lot of prompts, and that “even with prompt, she was, uh, unable to then string together sentences with more than 10 words. Uh, typically, in my memory, her responses were limited to either 1 to 2 words.”[\[note: 69\]](#Ftn_69) According to Mr Leung, V2 had to be prompted by her father to answer questions, and her responses would be to nod and say “Yes”. Further, V2 was not able to elaborate even though Mr Leung had provided prompts to encourage her to do so. [^70]

89     In light of the opinions of the IMH experts, the evidence of the other witnesses who dealt with the alleged victims, and also in light of the accused’s own history and interactions in Singapore, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused would have known, within a _short period of interaction_ with the alleged victims, that they are not of normal intelligence. This was especially so since the accused undoubtedly had plenty of opportunities and time to interact with and to observe both alleged victims at or before the time of the offences. Specifically:

> a)     On 18 November 2018, prior to committing the offence set out in the 1st charge against V1, the accused had dinner with V1 (which lasted for at least 15 minutes) and had asked her for directions; and

> b)     Prior to committing the offence set out in the 6th charge against V2, the accused had a videocall with V2 and also conversed with her on the phone no less than three times. Even at their first meeting on 24 November 2018, it was the accused’s own evidence that he had conversed with V2 in person before he committed the acts which are the subject matter of the charge involving V2.

90     In addition, I also agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s attempt to distance himself from evidence that he was aware of the alleged victims’ mental incapacity, by claiming he is a foreigner who does not speak English as a first language, was a claim that does not hold water. In this regard, the audio transcript (P19) of his conversation with PW8 and others, clearly showed that the accused can converse in English with normal-functioning adults. Further, as noted earlier, the accused’s own evidence that he has to interact with normal-functioning adults in English, would clearly have alerted him to the differences in the alleged victims’ behaviour and speech patterns from those of normal adults. I would add that while this was not evidence I placed particular emphasis on, I also agreed with the Prosecution that to some extent at least, this conclusion that the accused was aware that the alleged victims were not normal functioning adults, was fortified by the recorded conversations that the accused had with PW8 on 8 December 2018 (see P19 and P20). [\[note: 71\]](#Ftn_71)

91     Thus, the overwhelming evidence was that the accused would have been aware of the mental incapacity of the alleged victims, and could hardly have made a mistake that they had the consented or had the capacity to consent to the sexual acts that he carried out on them.

92     In any event, the Defence has failed, abysmally, to establish that the defence of mistake applied to excuse the offences, since not a single one of the requisite elements of the defence, let alone all of them, has been established by the Defence on a balance of probabilities. Specifically, the Defence has failed to show:

> a)     there was sufficient cause for the relevant accused person to believe that either or both of the alleged victims had consented; or

> b)     that he had exercised due care and attention; or that

> c)     his alleged belief was in good faith.

93     In short, the defence of mistake was clearly not available or applicable on the facts of the present case.

## Aspects of accused’s evidence that were incredible and unbelievable

94     The Prosecution also set out, in considerable detail, various aspects of the accused’s evidence that were inconsistent and incredible, and argued that the accounts put forward by the accused must have been afterthoughts.[\[note: 72\]](#Ftn_72) These inconsistencies in his evidence, stemmed from differences in accounts between his testimony in court from what he had informed the police when giving his statement P2, as well as the contradictions that arose in the accused’s testimony in court, and also the unexplained changes in position between the accused’s testimony, and the position his counsel had put to the Prosecution witnesses – especially the psychiatrists - in the course of questioning them.

95     The inconsistent and incredible positions taken by the accused and by his counsel, ranged from such matters as the accused’s first interaction with V1, what V2 purportedly said to the accused over a video call made by V1, the accused’s claim that V2 had told the accused that she does not want him to keep a relationship with V1, V1’s and V2’s apparent incessant attempts to contact the accused and their alleged obsession with him, and also about V2 allegedly informing the accused that she wanted to marry him. Without going into any great detail about these contradictions which the Prosecution had carefully set out in its submissions, I would only add that the inconsistencies and clearly unbelievable claims made by the accused, as highlighted by the Prosecution, were never properly accounted for by the accused in his testimony, nor were they even addressed by counsel in submissions, despite the Defence being given ample opportunity to do so.

96     Further, I also noted that the Defence adopted a constantly shifting and inconsistent stance as regards the contents, and belatedly, even the voluntariness, of the accused’s statements, P2 and P3. In this regard, in the course of his testimony, the accused had raised claims about various alleged inaccuracies contained in his police statements P2 and P3, and also about his condition when he was giving his statements, when these same issues were never raised by his counsel when the recorder, ASP Ong, or the interpreter, Mr Abdul were on the stand. Further, despite the contradictory position adopted by the accused and his counsel, I noted that the accused’s counsel, when putting up the Defence submissions, again made no attempt to address such obviously conflicting and unsatisfactory aspects of the Defence.

97     Suffice to say, it was clear that as the accused’s accounts were full of contradictions, and generally impossible to believe. I found him to be a witness of little credit. I thus agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s version of affairs, and his exculpatory claims, should be rejected in full.

98     For completeness, I would add that the issue of the accused’s credibility was of particular importance in the present case in light of the defence of mistake that the Defence had attempted to put forward, especially as the accused was the only witness for the Defence. Since the burden was on him to establish this defence, that the accused kept giving inconsistent and incredible accounts, and made himself a highly unbelievable witness, made it even more of an uphill task for the defence of mistake to be established. In any event, as I have already explained why I was of the view that the defence of mistake had not been made out, I shall say no more about this matter.

## Alleged victims’ failure to testify and the issue of competency

99     To summarise, I found that the Prosecution had successfully established beyond a reasonable doubt:

> a)     The elements of the offences;

> b)     That there was no valid consent by the alleged victims to the acts committed by the accused against them that are the subject matter of the respective charges; and

> c)     That there was no valid defence raised as to the charges.

100    The above findings would have been sufficient to find the accused guilty on all six of the charges that were proceeded with against him.

101    Nevertheless, for completeness, I now deal with the issue about the absence of testimony from the alleged victims. In this regard, I note that:

> a)     With several notable exceptions, all persons are generally competent to testify. In this regard, section 120 of the Evidence Act, (Chapter 97, 1997 Revised Edition). provides that:

>> All persons shall be competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.

>> Explanation —A lunatic is not incompetent to testify unless he is prevented by his lunacy from understanding the questions put to him and giving rational answers to them.

> b)     For allegations of sexual offences, where there are no third-party eyewitnesses to the commission of the offences, and no outright confessions by the offender to all elements of the offence, the testimony of the victims would usually be necessary to prove the charges.

102    In the present case, the alleged victims did not give evidence in court as the expert opinions rendered by the psychiatrists were that both of the alleged victims are essentially not fit to testify in court.

103    In the case of V1, Dr Chai had examined V1 and produced a medical report (P7) which indicated that:

> a)     V1 has an intellectual disability;

> b)     She **is not fit to testify in court**; and

> c)     She was unable to give a clear and consistent account of the alleged offence.

104    In the case of V2, Dr Leong had similarly examined this alleged victim and had produced a medical report (P5) which indicated that:

> a)     V1 is moderately intellectually disabled;

> b)     That V1 is **highly unlikely to be able to follow normal Court proceedings due to her disability**; and

> c)     Her answers were at times unclear and irrelevant during parts of the interview which she did not comprehend, and thus required her father to answer on her behalf.

105    In court, both Dr Chai and Dr Leong elaborated on their views, and clearly and convincingly explained why they each felt that the respective alleged victim was in no position to give court testimony.

106    The Prosecution also cited authorities for the proposition that the competence of a witness to testify should be assessed by a medical expert, and if assessed to be unfit to testify, he/she **cannot** be called to give evidence. [\[note: 73\]](#Ftn_73)

> a)     In _Kee Lik Tian v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1984\] 1 MLJ 306</span>, the appellate court held that in the context of that case, the learned President should have determined “…the competence of the witness to testify for purposes of s 118 of the Evidence Act 1950… with the aid of expert medical opinion…”, and that “had this procedure been followed and the learned President found as a result that PW3 was incompetent, **_then she would have been rejected as a witness_**”.

> b)     In _Zulaikha Bee bte Mohideen Abdul Kadir v Quek Chek Khiang_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 532</span> (“_Zulaikha_”), which was a civil case, the plaintiff was diagnosed by a consultant psychiatrist at Gleneagles Medical Centre to be suffering from dementia which impaired her cognitive functions, and she no longer had the mental capacity to retain or understand relevant information related to the suit and would not have been able to follow court proceedings or to advise counsel. The psychiatrist there had therefore opined that she was unfit to appear as witness. Under such circumstances, Tan Siong Thye J disallowed the defence counsel’s application to call the plaintiff as a witness, explaining at \[24\] that “(i)n view of her dementia and other mental conditions the court is of the opinion that her evidence would be unreliable as she would not be able to appreciate and understand the questions put to her.”

107    Aside from the above two authorities cited by the Prosecution, as I have also alluded to earlier, in the recent case of _GCK (CA)_, the victim of the sexual offence was found to have significant cognitive impairment and was assessed by the examining doctor not to be fit to testify in court. Nevertheless, even without the victim’s testimony, the District Court found that there was sufficient evidence to establish the charge of outrage of modesty against the offender beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the accused. The conviction was subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

108    Going back to section 120 Evidence Act, as stated above, a witness is generally deemed to be competent to testify until the court decides otherwise. Specifically, section 120 provides that witnesses should testify “…unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions by … **disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind**.” (emphasis added)

109    As can be seen from the discussion above, in order to decide whether a witness may be incompetent to testify due to her mental condition, it is obvious that expert psychiatric evidence is important and relevant for this determination, as was made clear in _Kee Lik Tian_ and _Zulaikha_, and also as seen from _GCK (CA)_. That such a determination is for the trial court alone to make, would be in accordance with the wording of section 120 Evidence Act. This conclusion is consistent with the above authorities, and was also a position that the Defence accepted.

110    In fact, it was because the Defence accepted that the alleged victims were incompetent to testify that the Defence had asked for their statements to be admitted into evidence under section 32(1)(j)(i) of the Evidence Act, (Chapter 97, 1997 Revised Edition) i.e. on the basis that the witness (i.e. each of the alleged victims) is “…unfit because of bodily or mental condition to attend as a witness”.[\[note: 74\]](#Ftn_74) The statements of the alleged victims were duly admitted.

111    In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that based on the available evidence, including the expert assessments, both the alleged victims were incapable of understanding the questions or of giving rational answers to them, and hence were not competent to testify in court. I elaborate below.

112    In determining that V1 was not competent to testify in court, I considered the evidence of Dr Chai, the psychiatrist who examined her, as well as evidence of V1’s sister-in-law, PW8.

> a)     Dr Chai, who had produced the expert report (P7) elaborated on her assessment of V2. Her evidence on this aspect, can be summarised as follows:

>> (i)       Dr Chai described V1 as quite slow in responses and who couldn’t answer or respond at times when she was spoken to. After interviewing V1, interviewing V1’s brother as well as referring to a psychological report carried out on V1, which included the IQ test results, Dr Chai came up with a report where she noted that V1 had a known developmental delay.

>> (ii)       Dr Chai had asked V1 about her account of the alleged offences, and said that V1 could not really tell her. V1 also could not recall the name of the accused, or how she came into contact with him. Dr Chai said that most of the time, V1 could not respond, or would respond with a single word or a short phrase of three words in simple Mandarin, regardless of whether the questions were open ended or close ended.

>> (iii)       Specifically, on V1’s fitness to testify in court, Dr Chai said that V1 did not have the ability to understand and answer quite a number of the interview questions. V1 was also not able to give a clear consistent account of the alleged incident. Further, when Dr Chai asked V1 about whether she understood what it meant by attending court, and whether she had some idea about court proceedings, V1 did not appear to be able to understand these as well. Thus, Dr Chai felt that V1 was not fit to testify or give evidence in Court. Dr Chai further estimated V1’s mental age to be around 10 years old.

> b)     PW8, who is V1’s sister-in-law, testified that based on what was told to her by her mother-in-law, V1 had previously had a high fever at the age of 3 years old, and she has had Down Syndrome since. PW8 also said described V1 as being able to communicate well with her 3-year-old son, while they (the adults) have to adapt their way of asking her as if she was a kid. If they were to talk to her like an adult, V1 would keep quiet and not want to answer.

113    For V2, I similarly found her incompetent to testify. In coming to this conclusion, I considered, in particular, the evidence of Dr Leong who had examined V2, as well as evidence from the psychologist, Mr Leung who had assessed V2. I also considered the evidence of V2’s father, who was her main caregiver.

> a)     Dr Leong, who produced the expert report (P5) elaborated on his assessment of this aspect of V2, as follows:

>> (i)       First, Dr Leong noted that V2’s father had to be present for the interviews he conducted with V2, as it was very challenging for V2 who has moderate mental retardation and who was shy in the presence of a stranger. He was concerned that she may actually panic or be in shock and refuse to say anything. Dr Leong also noted that prior to his third meeting with V2, where she greeted Dr Leong, V2 was very shy, and she would look down, and respond with very slow and very startled speech. V2 basically just looked at her father whenever Dr Leong posed a question.

>> (ii)       V2 also has very limited speech ability, and does not have good command of language. In terms of V2’s speech, she couldn’t speak full sentences, and most of the time, it’s just two to three words, and she would use very simple words. After saying two to three words, she will just pause and freeze. V2 also needed a lot of prompting and he had to give her a lot of cues in order for her to continue to speak. Her answers were unclear and, at times, irrelevant during parts of the interview which she did not comprehend and thus required her father to answer on her behalf.[\[note: 75\]](#Ftn_75) Dr Leong said that even both her parents could only comprehend about 50% of what her verbal expression was.[^76]

>> (iii)       While V2 was orientated to time and place, she was unable to articulate the days of the week in order, nor give the date or year.

>> (iv)       When Dr Leong approached V2 about court proceedings, he noted that she doesn’t understand about court proceedings, the judge, the law, and the various other aspects. She also started to get very distressed when Dr Leong kept asking some questions. V2’s father said that it was best for V2 not to go to court, since similar to her experience when going to the nursery, she would cry inconsolably. V2 would start to do this in a new and strange environment.

>> (v)       Thus, Dr Leong said that from his understanding and assessment of V2 as being moderately intellectual disabled, she would not be able to attend court.[\[note: 77\]](#Ftn_77) His view was that she was highly unlikely to be able to follow normal court proceedings due to her disability. Further, Dr Leong opined that because of V2’s moderate intellectual disability, she was not fit to testify. His view was that it was very likely that she will act out, break down, and freeze if she has to come to court. It was also highly unlikely that she can understand questions put to her or give rational answers to these questions because this is a strange and new environment to her. Her answers may also be irrelevant because of her anxiety.

> b)     As regards V2’s psychological assessment by Mr Leung, the latter had conducted a psychological test, and conducted an interview with V2 with V2’s father present for part of that interview. Ms Leung had ascertained from an initial conversation with V2 that the latter was unable to answer simple questions such as what she was doing, or what she was working as. V2 also had to be prompted by her father to answer questions, and her responses would be to nod and say “Yes”. Further, V2 was not able to elaborate even though Mr Leung provided prompts to encourage her to do so. In his report P17 on V2, Mr Leung had noted that while V2’s speech was generally coherent and relevant during simple conversations, her answers were unclear and at times irrelevant during some parts of the interview which she did not comprehend. She thus required V2’s father to answer on her behalf. V2 was also unable to provide her NRIC number and could not articulate the days of the week in order and was not oriented to the date, month and year stating that it was year 2013 at the time of assessment despite prompts. Mr Leung opined that V2 met the full criteria of the intellectual disability as defined by the DSM-5, and was hence, mild to moderately intellectually disabled.[\[note: 78\]](#Ftn_78)

> c)     PW5, who was V2’s father, testified that when V2 was born, she was a “blue baby”. When she was 7 years old, the nursery refused to accept her because she was not mentally fit, and they subsequently enrolled her in MINDS school. He said that V2 does things very slowly, she could not walk straight or steadily because her mind could not concentrate, and she could probably string less than 5 words in a sentence, and these were not complete sentences. Neither could V2 carry out a conversation in English as she would use short forms. While he was able to understand her, PW5 doubted that other people would understand what she wants. PW5 said that V2 also could not carry out a conversation in Mandarin as she could say a few sentences only.

114    To summarise, based on the evidence above, it was clear that neither V1 nor V2 was fit to testify in court due to the limitations resulting from their respective mental conditions, which prevented them from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to the questions.

115    In any event, the absence of their testimonies was not a crucial consideration in this case, in light of the evidence already adduced, including evidence derived from the accused himself, which was sufficient to make out all the elements of the charges.

## Conclusion

116    To summarise, having carefully assessed the evidence, as well as the relevant legal provisions and legal authorities, I was satisfied that the accused had committed the acts set out in the charges with the requisite _mens rea_, that there was no valid consent by the alleged victims to any of the acts committed against them by the accused, and that there was also no valid defence raised to excuse or exonerate him. Accordingly, I find the accused guilty on all six charges against him. I will now deal with sentencing.

## Sentencing

117    The accused is a first offender. To reiterate, he was convicted after trial of a total of six charges. These consisted of:

> a)     Five charges involving V1 i.e. four charges of outrage of modesty, and one charge of sexual assault by penetration; and

> b)     One outrage of modesty charge involving V2.

118    As noted above, both V1 (then 39 years old) and V2 (then 27 years old) suffer from mental disability.

### Prosecution’s Sentencing Submissions

119    The Prosecution described the accused’s conduct as “…nothing short of exploitative: he slaked his lust at the victims’ expense, received nude photographs from at both the victims,[\[note: 79\]](#Ftn_79) and once he grew weary of \[V1\], he proceeded to “promote” her to his distant uncle as a potential sexual conquest. Such conduct is as ghastly as it is deplorable, and public policy demands that those who _sexually_ exploit such vulnerable victims be met with stiff punishment to deter like-minded individuals.” [^80]

120    The Prosecution sought a global sentence of at least 10 years and 22 months’ (or about 11 years and 10 months’) imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane, in respect of the six charges, with the proposed sentence for the individual charges as follows:

#### Outrage of Modesty Charges

121    For the outrage of modesty charges, the Prosecution highlighted several offence-specific factors, namely:

> a)     Degree of sexual exploitation: This factor especially applied in the case of the 1st, 2nd and 6th charges where the accused intruded upon the breasts of the victims in these charges, and hence would fall within the lower end of Band 2 of the framework set out in in the case of _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthi Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (“**_Kunasekaran_**”). As for the 3rd and 4th Charges, while there was no intrusion of private parts, the offences involved multiple acts committed against the victims, and they were not merely fleeting or momentary.

> b)     Exploitation of vulnerable victims: Both victims were intellectually disabled, and hence are highly vulnerable.

> c)     High level of premeditation: For the 1st and 2nd charges, they were committed on the very day that the accused met V1. The Prosecution argued that having assessed that V1 was not of normal intelligence, his conduct thereafter in inviting her to have a meal at McDonald’s with him, and then isolating her at locations away from public view were deliberate. As for the 3rd and 4th Charges, the level of premeditation was even higher than the first two charges, as by the time of the offences, the accused would have been well-aware that V1 was vulnerable, and still took deliberate steps to seek her out and commit sexual offences against her person, leveraging on the fact that it was V1’s birthday. As for the 6th Charge, which concerned V2, the level of premeditation was the highest of all since the accused had earlier told V1 that he wanted two girlfriends, and as a consequence, V1 had introduced V2 to him. The accused had then deliberately isolated V2 by sending V1 to buy him a drink, which allowed him to commit the offence against V2 undisturbed.

122    In line with its analysis, the Prosecution submitted that:

> a)     For the 3rd and 4th Charges (which do not involve any intrusions onto the victims’ private parts), they would fall within the lower end of Band 2, attracting an indicative starting sentence of five to seven months’ imprisonment.

> b)     For the 1st and 2nd Charges (which involved skin-over-clothing intrusions upon V1’s breasts) they would fall within the middle range to the lower-end of the upper range of Band 2, attracting an indicative starting sentence of eight to 12 months’ imprisonment, with caning.

> c)     For the 6th Charge (involving skin-over-clothing intrusions upon V2’s breasts and significant premeditation), this would fall within the upper range of Band 2 attracting an indicative starting sentence of 13 to 15 months’ imprisonment, with caning.

123    Further, in light of the offender-specific factors, namely the accused claiming trial to his charges, his account that the victims had initiated the contacts with him, and his casting unwarranted aspirations against the recording officer and Bangladeshi interpreter, as well as the lack of any offender-specific mitigating factors, the court should impose an imprisonment sentence at the higher-end of the indicative starting ranges for each charge, i.e. at least the following imprisonment sentences:

> a)     Seven months’ imprisonment for the 3rd and 4th Charges;

> b)     12 months’ imprisonment for the 1st and 2nd Charges; and

> c)     15 months’ imprisonment for the 6th Charge.

124    As for the issue of caning for the 1st, 2nd and 6th Charges, taking guidance from _PP v Tan Kok Leong_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 188</span> (“**_Tan Kok Leong_**”), where the court had noted that there was a need to penalise an offender for the gravity and egregiousness of his offences, caning should be imposed. Further taking guidance from the decision in _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“**_GBR_**”) at \[40\], where there was exploitation of a vulnerable class of victim, there was a further need for a sufficiently deterrent and retributive sentence to be imposed.

125    Thus, as the accused had exploited two particularly vulnerable victims who were highly susceptible to grooming and exploitation, as he had intruded upon their private parts, as his offences were also premediated, and as he has demonstrated an utter lack of remorse in the way that he conducted his defence at trial, the Prosecution argued that the at least one stroke of the cane should be imposed for the 1st, 2nd, and 6th charges.

126    The Prosecution also submitted that the sentences sought for the outrage of modesty charges were in line with the decisions in _GCK (CA)_, and _PP v GCZ_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGMC 25</span> (“**_GCZ_**”) in light of the following:

> a)     In _GCK (CA)_, the offender had claimed trial to one charge of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the Penal Code, where the victim was an elderly female resident at a nursing home. The victim suffered from serious physical and cognitive disabilities and was found unfit to testify. The offender had placed his groin area on her groin area, and there was skin-to-skin contact. The Court of Appeal held that this case fell within the middle of Band 3 of _Kunasekaran_ given the high degree of sexual intrusion, abuse of trust, and the exploitation of a vulnerable victim., and held that the appropriate sentence would be 16 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane (after factoring in the seven weeks that the offender had spent in remand).

> b)     In _GCZ_, the offender claimed trial to three charges of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) Penal Code. The offender was a Grab driver who offered a car ride to the victim after a night out. The offender first kissed the victim on the mouth (1st charge), and, when he realised that she was intoxicated, he touched her breast over her clothes (2nd charge). He later pulled her into the backseat of the car where he used his hand to squeeze her breast, touch the vagina area over her clothes and kissed her (3rd Charge). The court sentenced the accused to three months’ imprisonment for the 1st charge, 10 months’ imprisonment for the 2nd charge, and 15 months imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for the 3rd charge. The court ordered the sentences for the 1st and 3rd charge to run consecutively for a global sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

#### Sexual Assault by Penetration Charge

127    As regards, the sentence for the 5th charge of sexual assault by penetration, with respect to digital-vaginal penetration, the Prosecution set out the sentencing framework in _Pram Nair (CA)_, which was in turn, built on the framework set out in _Ng Kean Meng Terence v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> (“**_Terence Ng_**”). The Court in _Pram Nair (CA_) had arrived at the following table as part of a sentencing framework:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="11.3422684536907%"><col width="50.870174034807%"><col width="37.7875575115023%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Types of cases</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Indicative range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases featuring no offence-specific aggravating factors or are cases where these factors are only present to a very limited extent and therefore have a limited impact on sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seven to 10 years’ imprisonment and starting point of four strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases usually containing two or more offence-specific aggravating factors</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 to 15 years’ imprisonment and starting point of eight strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Extremely serious cases of sexual assault by penetration by reason of the number and intensity of the offence-specific aggravating factors</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 20 years’ imprisonment and starting point of 12 stokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

128    In applying the framework and determining the appropriate sentence for the offence, the court should first identify which band the offence in question falls within, having regard to the offence-specific factors, and then determine precisely where within that range the present offence falls in order to derive an indicative starting point, which reflects the intrinsic seriousness of the offending act. Next, the court then considers offender-specific factors, _i.e._ the aggravating and mitigating factors which are personal to the offender to calibrate the appropriate sentence for that offender.

129    In the present case, the Prosecution argued that the facts of the 5th charge fell within Band 2 of the above framework, attracting an indicative starting sentence of around 10-12 years’ imprisonment and five to eight strokes of the cane. This was in the light of many of the same aggravating factors that applied to the outrage of modesty offences, i.e.

> a)     V1, who suffers from moderate intellectual disability, is extremely vulnerable; and

> b)     Similar to the 4th charge of outrage of modesty which was committed around the same time as the sexual assault by penetration offence, there was a high level of premeditation involved for the latter.

130    Thereafter, taking into consideration the offender-specific aggravating/mitigating factors, namely that the accused had claimed trial, his lack of remorse from the nature and conduct of his defence, and also the lack of any offender-specific mitigating factor, the court should impose a sentence at the higher end of the indicative starting range, i.e. 12 years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.

131    The Prosecution also submitted that the sentence sought was in line with the decisions in _Pram Nair_, _Ridhaudin_, and _BPH v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 764</span> (“**_BPH_**”), taking into account the various sentencing factors that applied to each of those cases.

#### Global Sentence

132    Taking into account the accused’s culpability, and applying the principles set out in _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“**_Shouffee_**”), and _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“**_Raveen_**”), namely the totality principle, the one transaction rule, and taking a last look at the facts and circumstances, the Prosecution proposed the following final sentences for the individual charges, and a global sentence as set out below:

> a)     1st and 2nd Charges of outrage of modesty: The sentence for each charge be reduced from the initial starting point 12 months to 10 months’ imprisonment, together with one stroke of the cane per charge;

> b)     3rd and 4th Charges of outrage of modesty: Each charge should attract a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment;

> c)     5th charge of sexual assault of penetration: The sentence should be reduced from the initial starting point of 12 years to 10 years’ imprisonment. The number of strokes should be reduced from eight to five strokes of the cane; and

> d)     6th Charge of outrage of modesty: The sentence should be reduced from the initial starting point 15 months to 12 months’ imprisonment, together with one stroke of the cane.

133    The Prosecution also argued that the sentences for three charges, namely the sentences for the 1st charge, 5th charge and 6th charge should run consecutively for a global custodial sentence of 10 years and 22 months’ imprisonment, and eight strokes of the cane.

### Mitigation Plea

134    The Defence did not propose specific sentences for the individual charges, nor did it put forward any proposed global sentence. Neither did the Defence attempt to distinguish the case authorities cited by the Prosecution, save that the Defence emphasised that the court should look at the facts of individual cases, and argued that there are limitations to relying on benchmarks and guideline judgments.

135    In addition, the Defence argued that the present case was exceptional in that the accused “ is a “simpleton”[\[note: 81\]](#Ftn_81), who worked as a construction worker without much contact with the fairer sex, and who was separated from his family back home when he met V1. Counsel submitted that “…this is a case of an adult mistaking another adult \[i.e. the victims\] of being capable of entering into relationship” and was not a case of exploitation. Counsel further argued that the accused had essentially been “neglecting to exercise reasonable diligence” in respect of ascertaining that the consent of \[V1\] was not real consent. Instead, it is a case of mistake or carelessness rather than “a clear-cut case of egregiousness”. [^82]

136    Further, the Defence took the position that the victims “were not kids” but are “basically working adults” and suggested that in the case of V1 and the accused at least, the intimacy was mutual. [\[note: 83\]](#Ftn_83)

137    Finally, counsel reiterated that “this is clearly a case of a construction worker befriending two female adults under the erroneous believe \[_sic_\] that they were consenting adults to acts of sexual interaction but which was not the case on a further and careful examination by seasoned psychiatrists much to the amazement and regret of the Accused”. [\[note: 84\]](#Ftn_84)

## Court’s decision on Sentence

138    The offences committed by the accused were directed at two victims who are both suffering from mental disability, and who do not have the capacity to consent to what the accused did to them. As shown from the evidence, the accused would have known, within a short period of interacting with V1 and V2, that they are not normal-functioning adults. Thus, with all due respect to Counsel and what he had stated in the mitigation plea, it was clear that this was not a case of the accused, allegedly a simpleton himself, acting under a mistake of fact, or under any form of misapprehension, confusion or misunderstanding, such as to exonerate or even to mitigate his offences.

139    Instead, it was against this backdrop of awareness and appreciation of the true state of affairs, that the accused essentially took advantage of his vulnerable victims, by committing a total of six separate offences – all of a sexual nature - against them. Five of these offences were committed against V1, and the last offence was committed against V2.

140    In the case of V1, two of the offences of outrage of modesty were committed within an hour of each other on 18 November 2018, the date that he first met V1, and another three offences, consisting of two outrage of modesty offences and one sexual assault by penetration offence, were committed on 24 November 2018 at about 5 pm and 7.30 pm. On 24 November 2018l, the accused also committed a separate offence of outrage of modesty against V2.

141    The outrage of modesty offences included such physical contact as hugging and kissing V1 and V2 on the cheek and lips, and touching them on various parts of the body including their breasts, back, shoulder, and thighs, while the sexual assault by penetration offence involved the accused penetrating the vagina of V1 by using two of his fingers. These was the facts established in the course of the trial, and also the same facts that apply for sentencing.

### Outrage of Modesty

142    In respect of sentencing for outrage of modesty charges, I agreed with the Prosecution that the _Kunasekaran_ framework should apply to determine whether a custodial sentence should be imposed, and if so, the appropriate length of imprisonment.

143    Under the first step of the _Kunasekaran_ framework:

> a)     The court ascertains the gravity of the offence by examining the manner and mode in which the offence was committed (“offence-specific factors”). This entails examining (i) the degree of sexual exploitation, (ii) the circumstances of the offence, and (iii) the harm caused to the victim whether physical or psychological.

> b)     After examining these factors, the court should place the offence within the sentencing bands that apply to claimed trial cases as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="20.76%"><col width="54.46%"><col width="24.78%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing Band</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Factors</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Range</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases that do not present any, or at most one, of the offence-specific factors, and typically involves cases that involve a fleeting touch or no skin-to-skin contact, and no intrusion into the victim’s private parts.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Less than 5 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases where two or more offence-specific factors present themselves. The lower end of the band involves cases where the private parts of the victim are intruded, but there is no skin-to-skin contact. The higher end of the band involves cases where there is skin-to-skin contact with the victim’s private parts. It would also involve cases where there was the use of deception.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5 to 15 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band 3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases where numerous offence-specific factors present themselves, especially factors such as the exploitation of a particularly vulnerable victim, a serious abuse of a position of trust, and/or the use of violence or force on the victim.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15 to 24 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

144    For the second step of the _Kunasekaran_ framework:

> a)     The court should consider the aggravating and mitigating factors that are personal to the offender (“offender-specific factors”).

> b)     Offender-specific aggravating factors include an offender’s lack of remorse and the number of charges taken into consideration. Mitigating factors include a timeous plea of guilt which obviates the need for a victim to be re-traumatised through trial proceedings.

145    In addition, the High Court in _Kunasekaran_ at \[50\] reaffirmed the guidance set out in _PP v Chow Yee Sze_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 1 SLR 481</span> (“_Chow Yee Sze_”) that the starting point is that caning should be imposed where the outrage of modesty involved the intrusion upon the victim’s private parts or sexual organs.

146    In the present case, the offence-specific factors highlighted by the Prosecution clearly applied. These were the degree of sexual exploitation in terms of the nature and extent of acts involved in the various outrage of modesty offences committed by the accused against V1 and V2, including such acts as hugging, kissing the V1 and/or V2 on their cheeks and lips, and the touching of the various parts of their anatomy, including the breasts of V1 and V2 in the case of the 1st, 2nd and 6th charges. The fact that V1 and V2 are vulnerable because of their mental disability, and the deliberate exploitation by the accused of their vulnerability, as well as the apparent planning involved especially for the offences that took place on the later date i.e. on 24 November 2018, were all offence specific factors that apply based on the _Kunasekaran_ framework. I thus agreed with the Prosecution that all the outrage of modesty offences fell within Band 2 of the framework. Further, where the outrage of modesty offence involved the touching of the breasts, caning should also be imposed in line with the decision in _Chow Yee Sze_, as affirmed in _Kunasekaran._

147    Moving on to the offender specific factors, I note that the _Kunasekaran_ framework is meant to apply to offenders who claim trial. In this case, the accused is also a first offender. However, while the Prosecution alluded to the accused’s conduct in trial as being an aggravating factor, I note that the accused was, at first glance when he gave his statements in particular his first statement P2, relatively co-operative in that he admitted to the acts that are the subject matter of the charges against him. In fact, but for his admissions, the accused may not have been successfully prosecuted since there was no independent eye- witness to the offences, and as both V1 and V2 are incapable of giving evidence in court.

148    Thus, all things considered, on a preliminary basis and as a starting point, I would impose the following sentences on the accused for his outrage of modesty offences, with a higher sentence imposed in the case of the outrage of modesty offence involving V2, as compared to V1, in light of the higher premeditation involved and the other factors cited by the Prosecution.

### Sexual Assault by Penetration

149    As for sexual assault by penetration offences which involved digital-vaginal penetration, the applicable sentencing framework was that set out by the Court of Appeal in _Pram Nair (CA)_ at \[158\]–\[160\]. As summarised in the recent High Court decision of _Public Prosecutor v CDL_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 122</span> at \[15\], the framework involves a two-stage exercise:

> a)     First, the court has to ascertain which of the three sentencing bands the accused’s offences fall within, having regard to the offence specific factors (which relate to the circumstances of the offence, such as the harm caused to the victim and the manner by which the offence was committed). Once the sentencing band has been identified, the court derives the indicative starting point by determining precisely where the case falls within the applicable range of sentences.

> b)     Second, the court calibrates the appropriate sentence by having regard to the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors, such as offences taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, and the accused’s remorse or his relevant antecedents, if any.

150    As regards the sentencing bands under the _Pram Nair (CA)_ framework, for ease of reference, I repeat them below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="15.62%"><col width="51.2%"><col width="33.18%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Band</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Type of Cases</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b><em>Indicative Range</em></b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases with no or limited offence-specific aggravating factors</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7–10 years’ imprisonment, 4 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Cases of a higher level of seriousness involving two or more offence-specific aggravating factors</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10–15 years’ imprisonment, 8 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Extremely serious cases owing to the number and intensity of offence-specific aggravating factors</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="middle"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15–20 years’ imprisonment, 12 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

151    In the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s offence fell within Band 2 of the above framework in light of V1’s vulnerability and the premeditation involved in the commission of the sexual assault by penetration offence. In this regard, I note that this was an offence that was committed on 24 November 2018, about 6 days after the accused had committed the initial sexual offences against V1, and after there was arrangement made for him to meet up with V1 on 24 November 2018 on the pretext of celebrating V1’s birthday.

152    Taking into account the nature of the offence, I was of the view that a sentence of 10 years imprisonment and 8 strokes of the cane would be appropriate, this being a sentence at the lowest end of the sentence in Band 2 of the _Pram Nair (CA)_ table.

### Global Sentence

153    Moving on to the global sentence to impose, and bearing in mind the principles set out in _Shouffee_ and _Raveen_ on the appropriateness of imposing consecutive sentences for unrelated offences, and also taking into account the totality principle and the one-transaction rule, I was of the view that adjustments should be made to the individual sentences to, _inter alia_, ensure that the global sentence was proportionate to the accused’s overall criminality, and that it would not be crushing.

154    I was also guided in the determination of the global sentence by the sentences imposed in cases cited by the Prosecution such as _GCK_ and _GCZ_ in the case of outrage of modesty offences, and the cases of _Pram Nair (CA), Ridhaudin and BPH_ in the case of sexual assault by penetration offences_._

155    In line with the above considerations, the individual and aggregate sentences finally arrived at are as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="26.22%"><col width="51.64%"><col width="22.14%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge No.</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Particulars</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentencing position (at least)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC- 911920- 2018</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Outrage of Modesty 354(1) Cap 224</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(“1<sup>st</sup> Charge”)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">On 18 November 2018, at around 8.00 pm, at the open space outside McDonald’s at Woodlands Civic Centre, the accused outraged the modesty of A1 by kissing her cheek and lips, hugging her and touching her breasts and back.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 months’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment and one stroke of the cane</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC- 904916-</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2019 (V1)</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">S 354(1) Cap 224</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(the “2<sup>nd</sup> Charge”)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">On 18 November 2018, at around 9.00 pm, at the steps in front of Blk 340 Woodlands Avenue 1, beside the carpark, the accused outraged the modesty of A1 by kissing her lips, hugging her and touching her breasts, back and thighs.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8 months’</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">imprisonment and one stroke of the cane (concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">DAC -

156    The global sentence is **9 years and 24 months’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane**. The sentence is backdated to the 8th of December 2018, which is his date of arrest, and to take into account the periods of remand and to exclude the bail period. The accused was on bail from the 3rd of January 2019 to 6th of July 2022.[\[note: 85\]](#Ftn_85)

157    I am of the view that the global sentence imposed on the accused is fair and proportionate, and has taken into account the relevant sentencing principles, sentencing considerations and sentencing precedents.

158    Finally, it leaves me to thank the Prosecution and the Defence for the detailed and useful submissions, which I have made extensive reference to in these Grounds of Decision. They have been of immense assistance to this court in arriving at the verdict and sentence in this case.
