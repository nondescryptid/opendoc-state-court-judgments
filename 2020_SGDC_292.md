### District Judge Luke Tan:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Leck Kim Koon, was a director of Intraluck Pte. Ltd. (“Intraluck”), a major aluminium importer in Singapore. He was tried before me on six charges under s 420 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224 Penal Code, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the PC”) (“proceeded charges”) for allegedly carrying out invoice financing fraud.

2       In relation to the proceeded charges, the Prosecution’s case was that the accused had deceived six banks by submitting duplicate copies of the same Bill of Lading (BL), in relation to five of the charges, and an Arrival Notice (AN) in relation to the same BL for a sixth charge. This was done in the course of making applications to these banks for invoice financing. The accused allegedly did this despite knowing that the goods stated in these transport documents (BL/AN) bore no relation to the goods stated in the invoices to be financed. As a result of these documents submitted, and the deceit practiced on the banks, funds were disbursed by the banks for the goods evidenced in these transport documents.

3       For the purposes of the hearing, and with the consent of the Defence, the Prosecution proceeded on a joinder of the proceeded charges.

4       At the end of the trial, and after going through the extensive notes of evidence (“NE”), the exhibits, and the submissions of parties, I was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to establish the charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and I convicted him accordingly. Thereafter, following the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence and the Defence’s mitigation plea, and after considering various reports tendered by parties, I imposed an aggregate sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment on the accused.

5       The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed appeals against his conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail. I now give the reasons for my decision.

## Charges

6       The accused initially faced more than 500 charges. Before me, the Prosecution proceeded with six cheating charges, with the remaining charges stood down. The proceeded charges were broadly similar in that they alleged that he had cheated the individual banks named in each charge, rather than any specific individual or officer of the bank.

7       I have reproduced the six proceeded charges below.

>      DAC-943114-2017 (16th charge): Involving DBS

## Evidence adduced by the Prosecution

10     In essence, the Prosecution’s case was that the accused had committed the offences of cheating through a scheme of invoice financing fraud. This was done through the Applications made for invoice financing to the six banks (DBS, KBC, Citibank, OCBC, ANZ and HSBC) by Intraluck.

11     The Prosecution alleged that the accused deceived the six banks by submitting copies of a Bill of Lading/Arrival Notice in support of six applications for invoice financing, despite knowing that the goods stated in the said Bill of Lading OOLU2564105080 (BL080), or Arrival Notice (AN080 that referenced BL080), bore no relation to the goods stated in the invoices to be financed. Pursuant to the Applications, and relying on BL080 (in the case of the DBS, Citibank, OCBC, ANZ and HSBC), and AN080 (in the case of KBC) that were submitted as part of the Applications, each of the six banks approved the respective invoice financing application and disbursed the sum to the beneficiaries listed in the application.

12     To establish its case, aside from the matters already agreed in the ASOF, the Prosecution called 16 witnesses to testify. Their details are set out below:

13     Further, aside from the agreed exhibits referred to in \[9\], as part of its case, the Prosecution also admitted into evidence various exhibits including:[^1]

> (a)     Documents pertaining to the credit facilities offered to Intraluck by the banks, and documents pertaining to trade financing, approval of financing, and other related documents from the banks;

> (b)     Four statements recorded from the accused under section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”);

> (c)     Intraluck’s ACRA profile and office layout;

> (d)     The First Information Report (“FIR”) and a Singapore Police Force acknowledgement slip; and

> (e)     A Foshan Sanshui Yongya Aluminium Produce Co Ltd Stamp.

14     I now summarise the main features of the Prosecution’s evidence.

### Evidence of documents submitted for invoice financing

15     In respect of each charge, there was no dispute that Intraluck had submitted the Applications to the six banks, and that they had been signed by the accused himself, or signed by him and Mdm Neo jointly.

16     Evidence was led from the representatives of the six banks as regards the Applications made to them. At the same time, evidence was led from UOB, the bank to which the original BL (BL080) was submitted to, before the same BL080 (or AN080 that referenced BL080) were submitted to the six banks.

#### The initial UOB application

17     Two witnesses from UOB were called to testify. Essentially, their evidence related to the UOB application made for invoice financing on 9 September 2020. It was not disputed that this was a valid application.

18     The first UOB witness, PW1 Teng Seng Lai (“Mr Teng”), a UOB Relationship Manager (“RM”) who had met the accused, testified that Intraluck has trade facilities with UOB, and that Intraluck had made an invoice financing application for a procurement of goods from China to Singapore.

19     Mr Teng explained that invoice financing refers to an arrangement whereby the customer, who has an invoice from the supplier for payment, can make an application to the bank for the financing based on this invoice. For such an application, UOB would require the customer to submit an application letter, an invoice and also documentary evidence for the shipment of goods, such as a BL or a delivery order. Also, in the application letter, the customer has to provide the invoice numbers and state the amount involved and the payment details. Mr Teng confirmed that these are the “…the usual standard requirements for the bank” for more than 20 years. [^2]

20     Mr Teng explained that the bank requires the shipping documents “…to show that there is a proof of a shipment that coming from a particular supplier to the customer. That's why we are financing the goods itself.” [^3] Mr Teng also said that his department, with its RMs, would pre-approve the suppliers to be financed for invoice financing.[^4]

21     Mr Teng explained that for the UOB application made by Intraluck reflected in AE2, while it was an AN rather than a BL that was presented, the application was still approved since an AN was evidence that shipping had been effected, and showed the arrival of the goods into Singapore. Mr Teng further said that for this application, if it had been the case that only the application letter and the invoice had been sent to UOB, he would not have approved the application. Instead, he would at least have sought further clarification to determine if any document had been missed out since they require a BL as proof of shipment, even if the supplier was from a pre-approved list.[^5]

22     The second UOB witness, Ms Sherry Low Sheue Ling (“Ms Low”), who has been the trade operations unit head since April 2014 and who manages her staff to process trade transactions, explained that clean invoice financing was financing based on invoices provided by customers, with proof that shipment has taken place. In the case of the transaction involving Intraluck, where the application was for US$60,415.51, the AN that was attached had the BL number indicated on the right hand side of the AN. For this particular application, the application was referred to the “business” side (i.e. the RM) because it referred to Norinco, a non-approved supplier, and the BL was also missing. Mr Teng, the RM, had approved the deviations on 9 September 2015 and they were instructed to disburse the money.[^6]

#### Application made to HSBC

23     Two witnesses from HSBC were called to testify.

24     The first HSBC witness, PW3 Ms Kathryn Koo (“Ms Koo”), was working as an export checking manager with HSBC in 2015. She testified that Intraluck had made an application for a clean import loan with an invoice issued by Lidong Aluminium & Metal Co. Ltd. Attached to the application form was a BL. The whole set of documents for the application (P2), which numbered six pages, were submitted at the same time at the HSBC trade counter on 15 September 2015 at 8.59 am.

25     Ms Koo also confirmed that, as indicated (“ticked”) on the application form, the loan provided to Intraluck was a “Post-Shipment Loan” i.e. one where the shipment had already been effected, and the customer would receive the invoice and present it to the bank to ask for the loan. Further, for such clean import loans, she explained that a copy of the invoice and a transport document (a BL), evidencing proof of shipment, was expected. Ms Koo explained that once such an application is received: [^7]

>     …the first thing is we will actually scan the documents into our internal system. Once we scan in, our China team will actually pick up the transactions to process by, first, they assign a number that tag to this account and, at the same time, they will check through the application, whether that is -- all the informations, like whether this application is within the customer course of business, check through the tenor and the facility, verify the signature and, from there, they actually go through the entire documents and process it, and at the same time they will input into our system for screening…They will actually check through the consistency of the documents. For example, they will check the goods' descriptions, the quantity and the amount between the invoice and the transport documents.

26     As opposed to a “post-shipment loan” (with a BL), there was also an option stated in the loan application form for a “pre shipment loan”. For such a loan, an invoice was financed without shipment, and no BL was required.

27     For this particular invoice financing application (P2) made to HSBC, which was for a post-shipment loan, Ms Koo confirmed that while the weight of the goods in kilograms for the invoice was 22,934, and the weight stated in the BL was 23,129 kilos, this was not regarded as a discrepancy as what was indicated on the invoice was actually the net weight, while the BL showed the gross weight of the goods after packaging. She confirmed that this was the industrial practice, and something they were aware of due to their experience checking such documents. Ms Koo also confirmed that the difference between the date of the invoice and date of the BL, and the fact that the indicated shipper (Norinco) and the indicated supplier (Lidong) were not the same parties, were also not discrepancies, but were norms for the industry.

28     Importantly, Ms Koo stated that if the application had been submitted without a BL, this would be an exception for which it would have been sent to the RM for approval or comments. Further, she confirmed that a BL was a requirement for such applications.[^8] However, for this particular application in P2, no ‘exceptions’ were highlighted, and the funds sought were disbursed. Ms Koo further explained that the decision to approve the loan in this case was made by the “China team”, and that HSBC has a “checking standard for them” which they “actually follow”. HSBC also has a team that oversees the work of the China team. [^9]

29     The second witness from HSBC, PW4 Ong Joo Liang Julian (“Mr Ong”), was the RM with HSBC who has handled the Intraluck account since early 2016. He explained that there were two letters of offer (dated 13 April 2012 and 31 March 2014) between HSBC and Intraluck which were signed by the accused, whereby HSBC had offered facilities to Intraluck, including for “clean import loan” or invoice financing. For such financing, the applicant has to submit an application form with several supporting documents to the bank, including the original or a certified true copy of the invoice, and the relevant transport document that was acceptable to the bank. The transport document serves as evidence that actual delivery and transportation of goods has happened. He explained that for overseas shipments, a BL was the document that was usually received. Mr Ong disagreed with the Defence that if the supplier stated in an invoice was pre-approved, and the application was made within the credit limit granted to the customer, HSBC would approve the application even if no BL was supplied. [^10]

30     As for the application P2, Mr Ong confirmed that this was an application by Intraluck to HSBC for a post-shipment loan. As far as he was aware, Intraluck does not deal with pre-shipment loans. Mr Ong also testified that from his own dealings with Intraluck, the accused was the boss and the decision-maker of Intraluck, and they always dealt with him on day-to-day matters. Mr Ong has met with the accused and has had lunch with him before.

#### Application made to Citibank

31     Two witnesses from Citibank testified.

32     The first Citibank witness was PW5 Quek Xiu Yan Florence (“Ms Quek”), a RM since 2013 who dealt with Intraluck for Citibank. She testified that Citibank had extended to Intraluck an import invoice financing facility that allowed financing to be made against a Citibank application form with a supplier invoice and a copy of the BL. Such an application for import invoice financing, would typically be processed by Citibank’s trade operations, and the RM would be involved only if there were deviations. Ms Quek confirmed that as a standard requirement of Citibank, the BL and supplier invoice were required for the trade financing loan, together with the application form. If there was no BL, they would not be able to proceed, but would return the document to the customer and ask him to submit it together with the BL.[^11]In the case of Intraluck, Ms Quek had explained these requirements to the accused and Mdm Neo, and the accused would be aware that there is a need to submit the invoice and the BL to Citibank to apply for such loans.[^12]

33     Ms Quek also said that in the invoice financing form, they have clauses to indicate that the customer was not allowed to submit the same invoice to other banks. In the case of the loan application made by Intraluck to Citibank (P5), Ms Quek testified that Intraluck had faxed in the application form, together with the supplier’s invoice and the BL. In this case, the supplier stated in the invoice was Easytec Aluminium, which was a pre-approved supplier. In addition, Ms Quek confirmed that while there was also a personal guarantee provided by the accused, the BL was still a document required by the bank, as this involved a post-shipment financing product. In contrast, for a situation of pre-shipment financing, where the application was made by way of a separate form, no BL was required as the credit risk was different.[^13] Specifically, Ms Quek explained that in a pre-shipment situation, the supplier had not shipped the goods yet, whereas in a post-shipment situation, there has already been a shipment of goods. So pre-shipment financing carries higher risks.[^14] In the case of Intraluck, Citibank had not extended them a pre-shipment financing loan facility, but only provided for them to make a post-shipment loan. Ms Quek further explained that for a post-shipment application, if there no BL was provided, the bank would have returned the application.

34     Ms Quek also stated that if there were deviations between the weight of goods in the invoice from that in the BL, the application would be referred to the RM. In the present case, as there was indeed such a difference, the application would have been referred to her as she was the RM, and she would have spoken to either the accused or Mdm Neo, or even the other staff as this was not a major discrepancy. Ms Quek also said that she was informed that the difference in weight was due to the packaging, and she had subsequently recommended to proceed, as she had checked with either the accused or Mdm Neo that the goods had been received at Intraluck's premises.

35     The second witness from Citibank was PW8 Ravi Senthil Prasadh (“Mr Prasadh”). He has been working in Citibank Singapore since 7 August 2017 as head of operations. Mr Prasadh testified that he managed pre and post-processing of documents, while the core processing took place in Malaysia. He testified that he exercises supervision over the Malaysian processing team to ensure that the performance was in line with the established standards within the bank. Mr Prasadh stated that Citibank provides the wording for the standard invoice financing application form used by the customers, and confirmed that the invoice financing application should be supported by an invoice and a transport document, such as a BL/seaway bill (i.e. for transportation by sea), an airway bill (for transportation by air), or road transport document. These documents were provided to evidence physical movement of the goods.

36     Mr Prasadh also testified that Citibank has a set of special handling instructions for Intraluck. These were set out in P7 (screenshot from Citibank’s system), and they stated that for Intraluck:

> (a)     Financing was to be made against supplier invoice and copy of the BL or delivery order; and

> (b)     To allow third party shipper on bill of lading as goods usually shipped by a third party (unadvised).

37     As for the invoice financing application made by Intraluck to Citibank (P5), Mr Prasadh confirmed that the application was accompanied by a BL in a single fax, and that the 5 pages of documents making up P5, were received as a single transmission in one bundle.[^15]

#### Application made to OCBC

38     Two witnesses from OCBC were called to testify.

39     The first OCBC witness, PW6 Ms Tan Kee Geok@Julia (“Ms Julia Tan”), has been a team lead of pre and post-processing in OCBC since 2013, where she oversees various products including invoice financing. She explained that after they receive the application from the customer, they stamp and scan the forms for the processing team to do the checking. The role of the processing team (the maker and checker) was to do the workability check, to verify the signature and information in the application, check the loan amount currency, and cross-check the invoice against the BL. If the BL was missing, the processing team would refer the matter to the pre and post team to contact the customer to rectify this. If the customer could not provide the BL, the pre and post team would inform the maker (in the processing team) who would then refer the matter to the business unit (i.e. the RM) for approval.

40     Ms Julia Tan confirmed that her team received a fax application on 12 September 2015 (P6) from Intraluck for an invoice financing loan. The application, which was 5-pages long, included an invoice (page 3), and a BL (pages 4 and 5). The BL had a stamp “Certified True Copy” affixed, with the accused’s signature underneath this stamp. She explained that invoice financing was a trade facility for financing the customer to purchase the goods on an open account basis i.e. where there is an agreement between the buyer and the seller to carry out a purchase and to arrange for the shipment of the goods, and subsequently to make payment directly to the supplier. The BL that was tendered was needed as proof of the shipment, and was a bank requirement. Ms Tan said that the bank would not approve the application without a BL in the case of a post-shipment application. [^16]Ms Tan further explained that a pre-shipment application has a loan duration of 30 days while a post-shipment application has a full tenor of 180 days. For this application, which was signed by both the accused and Mdm Neo, it was a post-shipment application, and there was no exception referral from the processing team to the RM. Further, while there was a discrepancy between the weight stated in the invoice and that stated in the BL, and also a difference of the BL and invoice dates, these were not issues for OCBC for this application.

41     The second witness for OCBC was PW7 Lee Soo Ching Serene (“Ms Lee”), who is a compliance officer. She was formally a RM with OCBC from 2013 to 2017, and she dealt with Intraluck from 2014 in that capacity. She confirmed that the accused was the director and majority shareholder of Intraluck. She had met him a couple of times, when OCBC first prospected Intraluck as a customer, and subsequently during annual reviews of the credit facilities. OCBC had provided a letter of offer to Intraluck to set out the approved facility. This letter was addressed to the accused who they understood to be the main promoter and decision maker of the company. Ms Lee further said that the facility offered by OCBC to Intraluck was secured against the personal guarantee of the accused alone, and not against Mdm Neo, the other director, since the accused had informed them that Mdm Neo was basically a long-time employee and shouldn't be made liable for such a guarantee.

42     When shown P5, which Ms Lee confirmed to be the invoice financing application form and supporting documents including the BL, she confirmed that the BL contained a stamp that the BL was “Certified True Copy” with the accused’s signature underneath the stamp. Ms Lee confirmed that the documents that she would expect for such applications would be the application form, the invoice and the shipping documents to evidence “a real shipment of goods so that we are financing a real trade application”. [^17] In the case of Intraluck, the company did not have a facility for pre-shipment financing. Ms Lee also explained that as compared to post-shipment financing, pre-shipment financing has a shorter tenor.

#### Application made to KBC

43     A witness from KBC, PW9 Mr Wan Wai Keong@Nigel (“Mr Wan”), was called to testify. Mr Wan is a RM who started working in KBC since 4 August 2014, and he was the person who introduced Intraluck to KBC for supplier invoice financing. Mr Wan testified that he knows the accused as the founder and a shareholder of Intraluck, and the key person in Intraluck to whom they addressed bank communications to. Mr Wan had also met the accused about four or five times, and spoken to him over the phone in the course of granting the facility to Intraluck.

44     Mr Wan testified that there was a list of approved suppliers for this credit facility, and a requirement for Intraluck to provide copies of invoices and copies of bills of lading or notices of arrival, which applies to transactions for both approved suppliers and other suppliers.

45     Mr Wan testified that Intraluck had submitted, via fax (followed by an original) on 14 September 2015, a letter for financing (P8) on Intraluck’s letterhead, which included an invoice (dated 12 September 2015) from a company called Norinco New Energy (Norinco) requesting that payment be made to a company called Easytec Aluminium. The first page of P8 contained the accused’s signature. Attached to this page was an AN issued by the shipper evidencing delivery of goods. The weight stated there was similar to that in the supplier’s invoice, with a slight variation, which KBC accepted as it was not substantial. The description of goods stated on the AN also matched that in the supplier’s invoice. Aside from these documents, P8 also included a trust receipt which set out the BL number, the name of the vessel, and the quantity and description of the goods, which the bank matched against the information on the AN. The amount and payee details also matched the same details in the invoice attached to the application. Mr Wan testified that the trust receipt has the accused’s signature. Further, the last page of P8 was a bill of exchange, evidencing that Intraluck owed the bank USD 90,253.25. The invoice number was also stated there.

46     Mr Wan explained that the aside from the invoice and the AN, the application also has the trust receipt and bill of exchange annexed to show that the bank had given the title documents to the company, and that the latter undertook to repay the loan. In the context of his bank, trust receipts were executed for invoice financing as the original BL was kept with the company with the bank accepting copies of the BL. For this application in P8, Mr Wan said that it was Intraluck which prepared all these documents and sent them to the bank at the same time. He said that for other invoice financing applications made by Intraluck to their bank, the company would also send the same documents i.e. “ the request on their letterhead, the supplier's invoice, the AN or bill of lading, the trust receipt and the bill of exchange.”[^18]

47     Mr Wan further stated that for this particular application, because the invoice was issued by Norinco, which was not an approved supplier, there was an internal form (P9) submitted to the credit committee to approve exceptions to the credit facility. For this case, Mr Wan had recommended to proceed with the request after checking the details with Mdm Neo although he could not remember whether he had also spoken to the accused about this transaction. In respect of this exception, Mr Wan said that Mdm Neo was not able to explain the exception immediately but said that she has to consult the accused.

48      Mr Wan said if the application did not come with an AN or a BL, the bank would not process the application and he would inform the customer that they could not accept the application. They would also say that this requirement was stipulated in the facility letter.[^19]

#### Application made to ANZ

49     A witnesses from ANZ Bank (ANZ), PW0 Mr Ashok Devidas (“Mr Devidas”), was called to testify. Mr Devidas is the head of trade product for South-East Asia and Europe, and he has been working in ANZ for 6 years. He testified that he takes care of the end to end processing of trade products for the bank, from governance to putting up policy documents and processing.

50     For the invoice financing facility provided to Intraluck, ANZ originally only required any two of the following three documents to be provided for the application, namely the “commercial invoice, transport document or contract of sale." Subsequently, in a later facility letter (AE7 dated 7 June 2013) issued by ANZ, two special conditions were added. These were as follows:[^20]

>     "i) Disbursement is restricted to purchases from suppliers as approved by ANZ from time to time and payments shall be made directly to these approved suppliers.

>     ii) Disbursement is subject to the submission of **_certified true copy of Bill of Lading_** (with the Borrower as consignee)."

>     \[emphasis added\]

51     Mr Devidas also said that with the change in conditions, which was acknowledged by Intraluck (as signed by the accused), “it's made clear that the bill of lading need to be submitted for every drawdown, and also the consignee mentioned in the bill of lading needs to be the borrower, which is Intraluck.” Thus, the BL was now mandatory, together with either a contract of sale or a commercial invoice or purchase.[^21]

52     Mr Devidas testified that Intraluck had made an application (P10) dated 14 September 2015 for trade financing. There was an option on the form for either “pre-shipment” or “post-shipment” to be selected. He explained that for pre-shipment financing, no shipping document was available, but a shipping document could be provided for post-shipment financing.

53     He testified that this application made by Intraluck was for a post-shipment loan as the transport document was provided, together with an invoice from Nummary International Co Ltd, with the invoice number matching what was stated in the field "Beneficiary Reference Details" on the application form. The amount to be paid under the invoice (USD91,776.18) also matched the amount of loan requested for in the application form, and the payee (in the invoice), and the beneficiary in the application, were both stated as \`Nummary International Co Ltd’. There was also a trust receipt attached to the document from Intraluck which was dated 14 September 2015, as well as a BL (at page 8 of P10) showing the consignee to be Intraluck, and that the goods were from China to Singapore.

54     Mr Devidas testified that the provision of a BL, with a consignee indicated as Intraluck, was consistent with the special condition in the third facility letter. Mr Devidas said that it was necessary for Intraluck to submit a certified true copy of the BL signed by an authorised signatory.

55     Upon the submission of P10, with the accompanying documents all faxed together in 9 pages, the application was then sent to the trade operations team within the bank to check against the facility requirements. The team would verify that the amount in the invoice matched that in the application, and that details of the application were as per the conditions required, including the fact that the supplier needs to be pre-approved, and also the consignee name for the BL. Mr Devidas testified that the processing staff have a list of things to check as per the standard operating procedures. He also explained that: “ Unless it is a requirement of the facility letter, it is not a standard procedure for the bank to check the shipper and the invoice supplier, because it's normal practice in the Singapore market itself that the shipper and the supplier are, majority cases, different.” If there was a need to check this, this would be stated as a special term on the facility letter. [^22]

#### Application made to DBS

56     Two witnesses from DBS testified.

57     The first DBS witness was PW13 Ms Catherine Tan Hui Tsu (“Ms Catherine Tan”). Ms Catherine Tan has been the team head in DBS, institutional banking group, for more than 10 years, where she leads a team of RMs to service customers. She testified that Intraluck has been their customer since 2004, and that she has met the accused and Mdm Neo as both of them were directors of Intraluck. Ms Tan said that for financial statements and queries about payments, DBS would contact Mdm Neo who takes care of operation and finance matters in Intraluck, while she described the accused as the promoter and main decision maker of the company. DBS had previously addressed their letter of offer (AE3) to the accused.

58     Ms Catherine Tan said that DBS offered invoice financing to Intraluck whereby the customer would submit an invoice for the bank to pay to the supplier from whom they bought the goods, and they have to fill up the BRP (bills receivable purchases) or invoice financing application form and also submit a transport document and an invoice as well. In the case of Intraluck, there was also a guarantee provided by the accused as he was the key promoter of the company. Ms Catherine Tan said that either the RM, or both she and the RM, would have gone through the letter of offer with the accused.

59     She testified that P13 was an application for bills receivable (pages 1 and 2) made by Intraluck to DBS, together with an invoice (page 3) and a BL (pages 4 and 5). On the first page of this document were the signatures of the accused and Mdm Neo, with the latter being identified as the contact person. Ms Catherine Tan confirmed that for such applications, the supporting documents that they normally require are an invoice and a transport document, to evidence a genuine sale and purchase transaction and to evidence that there has been a shipment of goods. The transport document for a delivery by sea would be a BL. Ms Catherine Tan said that the requirements for these two types of supporting documents were made known to the customer when they were granted the facility. She also said that such an application could be submitted by hand, fax or by Internet banking.

60     Ms Catherine Tan said that P13 was a post-shipment application since the application form was dated 10 September, while the invoice was dated 7 September. The BL also stated that the date when the goods were laden on board was 31 August. She explained that this meant that the goods had been shipped first in August. Ms Catherine Tan said that they knew Intraluck to be stockists i.e. the goods would come to their warehouse to be stocked. In any event, based on P13, the goods were being purchased by Intraluck since the invoice was made payable to Intraluck, and the goods were shipped to Intraluck as the BL stated Intraluck’s name there.[^23]

61     Ms Catherine Tan explained that once an application was received, it goes to the trade operations team which processes the request. If there was no issue with the request, the RM was not informed. Otherwise, the team would raise an email i.e. send a trade highlight to the RM. If this were to happen, the RM would look at what was highlighted by the trade operations team, and if necessary, would clarify with the client. If it was a credit-related issue, he would have to seek credit for approval. In the case of Intraluck’s application in P13, Ms Catherine Tan does not know if there was any escalation of this application to the RM from the trade operations department. She also does not know if Mdm Neo, the contact person for Intraluck as stated in P13, was contacted to refax the documents for the application.

62     The second witness from DBS was PW14 Madam Low Kim Lian (“Mdm Low”), the vice president of the operations department. She has been dealing with trade operations for 40 years. When she was in the exports team prior to 1 March 2018, she handled trade customers with import and export transactions. These premier customers also have invoice financing facilities.

63     With reference to P13, she described this as an imports invoice financing application form, together with supporting documents for the application. As indicated on the application, the documents came in to DBS by fax. The invoice was found at page 3, and the BL at pages 4 and 5. While the invoice and BL were copies, this was sufficient for the finance application.

64     Mdm Low said that once such an application is received, it would be sent to the document checking pool, where there are a number of document checkers to check the documents i.e. the application, the invoice and the BL. They would verify that the signature was correct, check that the supplier's invoice matches with the BL, and that everything was in good order, following which they would send the application to the “maker” for processing in the system. The maker would then carry out the data input in the system, and send the application to the authoriser who would authorise the transaction. The funds would then be paid to the supplier. Mdm Low testified that “(w)e have our internal procedures where the document checkers are briefed on what is required for checking and how to raise trade highlight or any deviation.” [^24]

65     Mdm Low explained that in the process of checking, if issues were discovered, the checker would inform the RM about what was not in order and the RM could then check with the customer and come back with the response. If it was a trade highlight that requires approval from the credit department, then the matter would have to send to them for approval. If it doesn't require credit approval, then the RM and/or his segment head could give the approval, because they were the ones who made the business decision. Mdm Low also described the application made by Intraluck to be a post-shipment application because the BL was presented at the time of the application. In any event, Mdm Low said that pre-shipment finance (facility) has not been granted to Intraluck.

66     She also said that the checkers have Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and that “…like this invoice financing, we also have our internal SOP on what is required for checking, so the staff are guided by that so-called internal SOP procedures, like say when do we raise trade highlight, like for example, the BL parties differs, or like stale invoice, stale shipment. So these are all these basic control checks that across the teams in main trade, we will check against. Of course, from different product, the control check may be slightly different.”[^25]

67     Mdm Low further produced an internal worksheet for the P13 application that had been filled in by her staff who processed the application. In it, the maker, releaser and checker had respectively signed to show their involvement in the approval process. There was also an indication which showed that when the document was checked, it was found to be clean and could be processed. Mdm Low further stated that if the transport document had not been presented, or if the customer was seeking payment in advance of shipment i.e. for a pre-shipment financing situation, these matters would have been highlighted.

68     Further, Mdm Low said that there is a “B releaser” who does a final check to see if anything has been overlooked by the previous people involved in the work. Hence, there were at least two people checking every transaction and application, namely the checker who does the first check, and the “B releaser” who does the final check before it gets authorised.[^26]Mdm Low said that as far as she knows, they have not received credit approval for a post-shipment application without a transport document available.

### Evidence from Intraluck

69     The Prosecution also called several witnesses from Intraluck.

#### Employees’ accounts and First Information Report

70     PW11 Ms Cheah Yin Li (“Ms Cheah”) was formerly an employee of Intraluck who had worked there for about 12 to 13 years. She left Intraluck on 3 October 2015. She is currently working for EDA Aluminium, and is also its shareholder. EDA Aluminium does more or less the same business as Intraluck. Ms Cheah is also a director of two other companies, Da Da and Hong Da. The business activities of these two companies are similar to that of Intraluck.

71     While at Intraluck, Ms Cheah dealt with finance and administrative matters, and took instructions from the accused and Mdm Neo. The accused would instruct her on trust receipts and invoice financing matters.

72     Ms Cheah confirmed that she had made a First Information Report (FIR) on 12 July 2016 (P11). Amongst other things, in the FIR, she stated that:

>     Sometime in September 2015, \[the accused\] had asked me to help him refax BL to the banks. He had photocopied one BL and then asked me to refax the same BL to about 6 banks. I cannot remember which were the banks, but there were Maybank, ANZ and HSBC. I found it suspicious that he was using one BL to fax to different banks because rightfully, one BL can only be sent to one bank and can only be tagged to one purchase invoice. I did not question \[the accused\] at that time as he is a very private person and would not tell us much.

73     Ms Cheah also said that was the only time when the accused had asked her to refax the BL, and that she had not done something like this before. On this occasion, she managed to fax some but not all of the BLs to the banks, but could not remember which banks she had successfully faxed to. The copies that she faxed had the word “original” on them, and also the stamps “Certified True Copy", and "Intraluck". The Intraluck stamp was held by Mdm Neo at that time.

74     Ms Cheah said that she finally decided to make the report (P11) after speaking to her Intraluck colleague, Ms Tan Soo Hooi to whom she had previously sought advice concerning the BLs that she was asked to refax. Ms Cheah said that was afraid that if the accused had really done something wrong, he would implicate her. Ms Cheah then called CAD (“Commercial Affairs Department”), without mentioning Intraluck and checked with the officer if what she did was wrong. She was then advised by the CAD officer that it would be better for her to make a report and that that it would be up to them to decide whether to investigate the matter. So she went to make the report later that night.

75     Ms Cheah said that when she tendered her resignation earlier, the accused had spoken to her and said that he hoped she would stay. He also told her that he wanted to leave the company and to downsize it and hand it to her and the other staff to handle. However, Ms Cheah had turned him down. He had then told her that he would welcome her back anytime.

76     Similarly, Mdm Neo had also asked her many times to stay back but Ms Cheah had rejected her. Mdm Neo had told Ms Cheah that if she had any problems, she could go back and look for them. Ms Cheah said that she did not tell Mdm Neo about what the accused had done because Mdm Neo and the accused had a very good relationship and Ms Cheah did not know if Mdm Neo had anything to do with this matter. [^27]

77     Ms Cheah said that at the time that she resigned, she did not have another job ready. It took her about a month to get another job and this was with EDA Aluminium where she was still currently employed. However, Ms Cheah denied that she was interested in joining EDA Aluminium before she left Intraluck, or that the purpose of incorporating EDA Aluminium was to take away business from Intraluck. She said that the majority of Intraluck’s customers were not those of EDA Aluminium.

78     Ms Cheah said that besides herself, other staff from Intraluck such as Tan Siew Ling, Hew Lee Wei, Nah Xin Ying, Tan Soo Hooi, and Ms Cheah’s brother, also left the company and joined EDA Aluminium. However, there were about two or three other employees who left Intraluck but did not join EDA Aluminium.

79     When queried by counsel, Ms Cheah denied that she and the other employees who left Intraluck had taken away product design drawings, mould drawings and account financial information from the company. She also denied the allegation by counsel that prior to her resignation from the company, she was caught gambling with other members of the staff and had been given a warning. Further, she denied hearing that her brother had failed to check goods to be delivered to clients, or to issue invoices or delivery orders. In addition, Ms Cheah denied that the only reason she made the police report (P11), nine months after she left the company, was to disrupt the operations of Intraluck, or to bring down Intraluck for the benefit of EDA Aluminium.

80     Asked about the practice in Intraluck, Ms Cheah explained that a BL sent to Intraluck would be brought by the courier to the office and would be received by the accused. He would then hand one copy of it to Ms Tan Siew Ling who dealt with purchases, and the latter would arrange to make payment to the shipping company, OOCL (Orient Overseas Container Line) which would then arrange for a transport company to move the container to the warehouse. That copy of the BL would then be returned to the accused. If the accused was not around, the BL would be received by Mdm Neo or by someone from the purchase department. Thus, one or two copies of the original BL would normally be sent over to the accused, and one of the copies would be with the shipping company.

81     For invoice financing, Ms Cheah said that Mdm Neo would fill in the details in the application, and then both she and the accused would sign on the document. The accused or Mdm Neo would then personally fax the document together with the invoice and BL or AN to the bank, or these would be handed over through post or by the office boys. For the latter, the accused would pass Ms Cheah a sealed envelope, and say that it contained the application form, and asked her to remind the office boy not to misplace it.

82     As for those forms faxed to the bank, Ms Cheah said that after the documents were faxed, Mdm Neo would ask her to check with the bank to see if it had received the documents. There had also been occasions when, after faxing, the accused had written down an amount for the invoice financing and asked Ms Cheah to check with the banks whether they had received the application for invoice financing for that particular amount. Ms Cheah does not know if the accused or Mdm Neo had asked anyone for help to fax the application forms to the bank, although she has done it once or twice herself. She also said that the fax room was next to Mdm Neo’s first room. Ms Cheah also said that Mdm Neo has two rooms, both with a printer, computer and telephone each.

83     PW12 Ms Nah Xin Ying (“Ms Nah”), who has been working at EDA Aluminium for 3 ½ years, had previously worked at Intraluck from end 2012 to 31st October 2015. At Intraluck, Ms Nah dealt with administrative matters, accounts, maintenance of machinery, recruitment, and any other work assigned to her by Mdm Neo or the accused (whom she called “the boss”). Ms Nah left the company on 31 October 2015, and tendered her resignation to Mdm Neo. The latter had tried to persuade her to stay on but Ms Nah refused. She said she resigned because two of her co-workers, Ms Ong Lee Hong and Ms Lee Bee Hong, had resigned and she had to take over their duties and also teach a newcomer. Ms Nah said that when she resigned, she did not have a job waiting for her. Instead, she went back to Ipoh before returning to Singapore where she joined EDA Aluminium because the boss of that company, Mr Chua, had approached her to join him. This was about one or two weeks after Ms Nah’s resignation from Intraluck. Aside from her, Ms Cheah, Ms Tan Siew Ling, Ms Tan Soo Hooi and Mr Cheah Leong Chen, who were all former Intraluck employees also joined EDA Aluminium. Ms Nah testified that some of the aluminium products that EDA Aluminium deals with were similar to those dealt with by Intraluck.

84     Ms Nah testified that there was also only one fax machine in the office and that this was in the fax room. Anyone in the office could use the fax machine, including the accused and Mdm Neo. She has also seen the accused use the fax machine before.

85     Ms Nah said that she has seen Mdm Neo print something like P5 before. She had also previously seen a document like the invoice at page 4 of P10 in Mdm Neo’s room. In addition, she had seen a blank document with the letterhead of Nummary International Co Ltd at the printer and after she changed the cartridge, Mdm Neo had printed out the contents in the document using the computer in her room. Ms Nah said that she had also seen the same letter when the accused asked her to check on whether the money had come into the company’s account, and then to issue the money to Intraluck. When asked about Easytec Aluminium, Ms Nah said that the accused had written the name on a piece of paper before and asked her to check if money had come in.

86     Ms Nah testified that she had informed Ms Cheah about Mdm Neo printing out the documents with Nummary International’s letterhead on it. This was more than a month before Ms Cheah left the company. She had also seen the stamp of the company Solid Vallation Co Ltd, and other stamps belonging to Easytec, Nummary International in Mdm Neo’s possession before.

#### Intraluck’s co-director: Mdm Neo Poh Choo

87     PW15 Mdm Neo Poh Choo (“Mdm Neo”) was a co-director of Intraluck. She had been working at Intraluck for 35 years, and started her employment as a clerk there, before being appointed as a director on 28 November 1991. As a director, she oversaw staff recruitment and vehicle and building management, while the accused was in charge of finance, accounts, purchase and logistics.

88     She described the company as one that sells aluminium extrusion, and other building products. The company had a paid up capital of S$12 million. The accused was the managing director of Intraluck who held 8.5 million shares, while she held 1 million shares, which were acquired but not paid by her. She described the accused as being in charge of the whole company and as “…the boss of the company,” while she was “an employee”.

89     Mdm Neo said that for bank financing, the accused would check with accounts and finance whether there are available funds, as the banks would give the company a credit line which they had to take note of. For company documents, the accused would sign on behalf of the company, and the company stamp would be affixed on the invoice financing applications by the girls from the accounts and finance department. On the application forms, Mdm Neo would sometimes be named as the contact person, and sometimes it would be her and Ms Cheah. The names of the contact person would be typed in by the staff preparing the invoice financing application. However, she has never been contacted by the bank in respect of any application, although she does not know if Ms Cheah has been contacted about this.

90     Mdm Neo said that when her signature was required for an application, the staff would attach a copy of the supplier's invoice which has the accused’s approval signature to the application form. It was only after the accused had signed, would the documents be forwarded to Mdm Neo for her signature on the invoice financing application form. When Mdm Neo gets the form, she would check the invoice to verify that the amount to be paid, the beneficiary, and the account number were correct before she signed. Mdm Neo said that she has never found any error or anything that needed to be changed after these checks. In any event, after she has signed, she would hand the document to the administrative or finance and accounts staff. However, Mdm Neo said that if the document was passed to her by the accused, after she had signed it, she would pass it back to him, and then he would pass it to the accounts and finance staff for processing and submission to the bank. She said that she has also not seen an AN or BL attached to the documents that were given to her.

91     Mdm Neo said that when she realises in cases like for P6, where the supplier’s name (Norinco New Energy Co Ltd) was different from the payee’s name (Nummary International Co Ltd) in the invoice, she does not question why the payment was not made to the suppler, as the accused has already signed on the invoice and approved it. Mdm Neo said that before she signs on invoice financing applications, she looks out for the copy where the accused has signed with the company stamp, approving the supplier's invoice and the bank. Mdm Neo confirmed that all documents (such as the BL in P13) that were certified as true copies, have to go to the accused to be signed. [^28]

92     Mdm Neo said that the fax machine in the office was used by the girls, that she rarely uses it, and that she was not very familiar with it. She only used the fax machine to fax her own personal things. As for office related matters, she would ask the employees to do the faxing. Mdm Neo also said that the accused does not use the fax machine, and that he does not know how to use it.

93     Mdm Neo said that in 2015, Ms Cheah was the employee dealing with accounts and finance, and she was in charge of payroll, payment to the bank and of miscellaneous expenses. Ms Cheah would prepare documents for invoice financing like application forms, and either Ms Cheah or Ms Nah would fill in the particulars. Mdm Neo described Ms Cheah as a very good staff and when Ms Cheah tendered her resignation, Mdm Neo had requested that she stay a little longer for her replacement to come in, but Ms Cheah said she wanted to do something on her own. As for Ms Nah, she had informed Mdm Neo that she wanted to go back to Malaysia to help her aunty who has a salon shop.

### Arrest of accused and the statements recorded

94     The Prosecution called PW16 Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ryan Yue Rui Sheng (“ASP Yue”), who was formerly a senior investigation officer in the syndicated fraud branch of the CAD, and the investigation officer (IO) for this case. ASP Yue revealed that after receiving the FIR and interviewing the complainant, Ms Cheah, he had checked with the banks on applications made by Intraluck and realised that the same BL was used in multiple applications with twelve banks.

95     On 29 August 2016, his team had escorted the accused and Mdm Neo to the office of Intraluck and carried out a search of the premises, before bringing the two of them to the CAD for questioning. They arrived at the CAD office around noon. ASP Yue said that the accused seemed well, and that he did not have any mobility issues and could walk normally. He was also able to answer coherently. Further, the accused did not exhibit any signs that indicated that he was unwell. [^29]

96     ASP Yue revealed that he subsequently recorded four statements under s 22 of the CPC (s 22 statements) from the accused in English at the CAD premises, with the statements given by the accused in Mandarin. For each statement, both the accused and ASP Yue signed at the bottom of each page. The four statements were as follows:

> (a)     Statement dated 29 August 2016 (P19);

> (b)     Statement dated 31 August 2016 (P20);

> (c)     Statement dated 7 October 2016 (P21); and

> (d)     Statement dated 18 October 2016 (P22).

97     P19 was recorded on the same day that the accused was brought to CAD. ASP Yue explained the recording process for P19 as follows:

> (a)     He had informed the accused about the offence being investigated, and had told him to say everything that he knows about it. The statement recording was carried out in a question and answer format using a laptop, whereby ASP Yue posed questions to the accused in Mandarin, and the latter replied in the same language. All the answers came from the accused in Mandarin which ASP Yue then recorded in English. ASP Yue confirmed that he is proficient in Mandarin. [^30]

> (b)     After all the questions had been asked and answers recorded, the accused’s statement was printed out in hard copy and then it was read back and explained to the accused in Mandarin, before he was asked to append his signature at the bottom left side of every page. The accused was also given an opportunity to make amendments to the statement. For P19, the accused only made one amendment concerning his nationality on the first page of the statement. This amendment was made in his handwriting and he had signed against it.

> (c)     ASP Yue said that the accused did not have any difficulties in understanding what he was asked of him because even when the accused didn't quite understand ASP Yue’s Mandarin, ASP Yue actually used a mixture of some English terms to further explain to him exactly what he was asking. ASP Yue said that he had no difficulty in understanding the accused. ASP Yue also went through the statement with the accused, and gave the accused an opportunity to read through the statement himself.

> (d)     In response to counsel’s questions on the recording of P19, ASP Yue denied that he had informed the accused that the interview was being audio and video recorded, or that there was a camera shelf in the interview room. There was also no separate question and answer session held before the formal recording started.

98     I set out below some of ASP Yue’s responses to questions about P19:

> (a)     For question 1, when ASP Yue asked the accused “Are you feeling well enough to provide your statement?", ASP Yue explained that it was standard protocol to ask this question at the start, and that this question was not prompted by the fact that the accused showed physical signs of being unwell.

> (b)     For the accused’s answer to question 5, it was the accused who stated that Intraluck was neither the buyer nor the seller of the goods, and that where one overseas company sells to another overseas company, the role of Intraluck was purely to function as the middleman in helping to apply for the loan financing. They actually get back the money when the other overseas company pays to them, and they would in turn pay to the bank, as well as earn from what was paid to them. ASP Yue further stated that his understanding was that “Intraluck does not buy any goods from them” and that “there is a buy/sell relationship between the two overseas company.” [^31] ASP Yue confirmed that he accurately recorded the accused’s answer to question 5.

> (c)     For question 14, ASP Yue denied that the accused had only answered with the words “Yes, I am aware”. Instead, he confirmed that the rest of the answer to this question came from the accused himself. ASP Yue also denied counsel’s suggestion that that he had allegedly asked the accused another question (after questions 14 and 15) about how the two applications for invoice financing - one to the mainland bank and one to Maybank - had the same BL and the accused had answered "I don't know, staff fax, I guess they anyhow slot in", or words to that effect. [^32]

> (d)     As for question 19, in respect of the authenticity of the invoices used, his investigations did not contradict the accused’s answer that they were not created by the accused, his staff or Mdm Neo, but that the accused had gone to China, Taiwan or Hong Kong regularly to collect the hard copies whenever they needed his help to get financing.

> (e)     For question 24, ASP Yue testified that for his question to the accused about his using the same BL for the applications to the banks, the accused was not specifically questioned in relation to the six applications that were the subject matter of the present charges, although they were part of the 584 applications made. Further, ASP Yue confirmed that whatever answers the accused told him, when he showed the accused the BLs used to support the different invoice applications, was recorded by ASP Yue in the statement. [^33]

> (f)     For question 29, where it was recorded that ASP Yue had stated: “Our bank screenings show that you have been applying for multiple loans from multiple banks using a same BL for the last year,” ASP Yue testified that the accused had himself informed ASP Yue that he was the one who would take the BL to attach with the application. When the staff received the documents, the BL was already included, and they would just process the application. ASP Yue disagreed with counsel that the question 29 was not what was said to the accused, or that the answer was not the answer that the accused gave.

99     As for P20, ASP Yue explained the recording process to be as follows:

> (a)     The recording of P20, dated 31 August 2016, commenced at 2.18 pm and concluded at 3.30 pm. It was recorded when the accused came to CAD in response to an appointment scheduled by ASP Yue. P20 was recorded in the question and answer format, with the statement given in Mandarin, and answers recorded in English. ASP Yue said that neither he nor the accused had any difficulty understanding each other during the statement recording. After the recording was concluded, the statement was printed out and ASP Yue went through it with the accused. He also showed the accused the statement for him to read through himself. The accused was given an opportunity to make amendments to the statement, and he amended his nationality to Singaporean instead of Chinese. Each page of P20 was also signed by ASP Yue and the accused.

> (b)     During the cross-examination of ASP Yue, in response to counsel’s questions, ASP Yue disagreed that the answers to questions 31 and 32, or that part of the accused’s answers to questions 32 and 39, were purportedly added to P20 by ASP Yue himself. He also disagreed with counsel that the accused’s answers to question 33 did not gel with the question itself. As for question 34, where the accused had given the names of the contact persons for Nummary, Lidong Aluminium, Solid Vallation, and for Easytec, the CAD had attempted to contact these persons, through the police in China and Taiwan but there was no response. ASP Yue disagreed with counsel that the accused had not used the Mandarin word for “reiterate” in his answer to question 39.

> (c)     ASP Yue also disagreed with counsel that the recording of P20 should have taken longer than 1 hour and 12 minutes (based on the commencement time and conclusion time of the recording as indicated on P20), and explained that the timing recorded on P20 did not include the time taken for the reading over of the statement. He also rejected counsel’s allegation that P20 (and P19) was not read over to the accused.

100    As for P21, ASP Yue explained that the recording of P21, dated 7 October 2016, commenced at 10.40 am and concluded at 12.20 pm. ASP Yue testified that the question and answers were given in Mandarin, and he recorded the statement in English. Similarly, neither he nor the accused had any difficulty in understanding each other during the statement recording.

> (a)     For question 47, on whether the accused submitted the named BL as a supporting document for the finance application, where the answer of the accused was recorded as “Yes”, ASP Yue denied counsel’s allegation that the accused had actually said “No” instead. ASP Yue also said that for this question, where there was a reference made to a number of documents with the INL reference numbers, prior to the statement recording, ASP Yue had prepared the necessary files containing the documents, and had shown and also gone through each page of the documents mentioned in the question to allow the accused to visually verify that these were the documents that he was referring him to. These included these five documents obtained from the banks:

>> (i)       The document INL-1A-004 that was referred to in the question was the same as P10 (the application submitted by Intraluck to ANZ for invoice financing);

>> (ii)       The document INL-3A-002 which was referred to in the question was the same as P5 (the application submitted by Intraluck to Citibank for invoice financing);

>> (iii)       The document INL-6A-004 that was referred to in the question was the same as P2 (the application submitted by Intraluck to HSBC for invoice financing);

>> (iv)       For the document INL-7A-003 that was referred to in the question, the last two sheets were the same as P8 (the application submitted by Intraluck to KBC for invoice financing); and

>> (v)       For the document INL-9A-003 that was referred to in the question, the last two sheets were the same as P6 (the application submitted by Intraluck to OCBC for invoice financing).

> (b)     In response to counsel’s questions, ASP Yue disagreed that since there was sufficient evidence to place the accused under arrest on 29 August 2016 after the recording of his first statement (P19), a different warning should have been administered to the accused when P21 was recorded. ASP Yue said that at that point, a charging decision had not yet been made against the accused.

101    As for P22, ASP Yue stated that:

> (a)     The recording of P22, dated 18 October 2016, commenced at 2.05 pm and concluded at 2.30 pm. ASP Yue had made an appointment for the accused to go to the CAD for the recording of the statement. ASP Yue testified that the questions and answers were given in Mandarin, and the ASP Yue had recorded the statement in English. Again, neither he nor the accused had any difficulty in understanding each other during the statement recording. Each page of the statement was also signed by ASP Yue and the accused.

> (b)     For question 127, where there was a reference made to the document INL-4A-004 was referred to in the question, this was the same as P13 (the application submitted by Intraluck to DBS for invoice financing). ASP Yue also said that he had shown this document to the accused and had gone through each page of the document with him. For this question (whether the accused had submitted the named BL as a supporting document for the loan application), where the answer of the accused was recorded as “Yes”, ASP Yue disagreed with counsel’s suggestion that the accused “…did not answer “yes", or that the "you" referred in the question was the company, Intraluck, and not the accused personally. Instead, ASP Yue said that the accused knew that ASP Yue was asking about the accused himself. [^34]

> (c)     For P22, ASP Yue denied counsel’s allegation that the statement took only 25 minutes to record because the questions and the answers in P22 were pre-prepared by him. ASP Yue explained that the questions asked in P22 were all similar to question 127, and that ASP Yue just showed him documents, and the accused answered the questions asked by ASP Yue. [^35]

102    ASP Yue said that aside from the statement recoding, he was also involved in recovering P14, the stamp (of Foshan Sanshui Yongya Aluminium Produce Co Ltd) from the drawer of the desk located in the accused’s own office. This was recovered on the day of the CAD raid of Intraluck’s premises. An acknowledgement form (P29) for the recovery of P14 was issued to the accused on 29 August 2016 which was the day of the raid. The accused had signed on this document. ASP Yue said that based on the documents provided to him by the banks, he has seen some of the invoices bearing the name and stamp of this company. When asked, ASP Yue testified that he did not question the accused about the stamp P14.

103    In respect of the FIR (P11) made by Ms Cheah, ASP Yue testified that he did not show the FIR to the accused when he questioned the latter, nor did he specifically question him on the allegations in the FIR.

104    ASP Yue also testified that he had carried out investigations on the authenticity of the invoices annexed to the application forms and discovered that there were no templates of them having been printed locally by a printing company that they had checked with. The CAD also did not recover any letterheads of companies other than those of Intraluck from the company’s premises, nor did they find soft copy templates of these invoices in the computers on Intraluck’s premises. When asked by counsel, ASP Yue said that while his checks showed that the same BL was indeed faxed to several banks, he did not ask any of the banks whether the same BL was refaxed to them.

105    According to ASP Yue, the accused was first charged for his offences on 16 November 2017. ASP Yue had recorded cautioned statements from the accused pursuant to section 23(1) of the CPC. ASP Yue said that after he had administered the warning to the accused, he could not recall the accused having said “Never mind, I will go to court and tell the truth", or words to that effect. In any event, ASP Yue confirmed that the accused gave an answer in Mandarin to the first charge, with the same answer applying to all the remaining charges, including the current set of 6 charges. His answer, translated into English, was essentially that:

>     As the managing director of the Company, I left all company documents and dealings with the Bank' Billing Dept for invoice financing application in the hands of my company staff. I just signed the application documents to confirm that the amount applied for and the paying company are stated correctly. Other documents to be attached to the application form were then taken care of by the administrative and accounting staff. They handed the documents to the bank and stayed in contact with the bank staff.

>     The invoice financing transactions between the company and the bank have been going on for nearly ten years or even longer. At the beginning, no so-called attached document was required; only the invoice was needed. I have never been told that there is any problem in our dealings with the bank. I spent most of my time doing business abroad, and the company has always paid its T/R due to the bank on time and never delayed payment. At the time of the investigation, we did not owe the bank any T/R that was due, and the company still had nearly SGD ten million in cash in its bank account.

106    ASP Yue stated that his investigation did not bear out the accused’s claim that “at the beginning, no so-called attached document was required; only the invoice was needed." However, ASP Yue confirmed that Intraluck had not defaulted in its payments to the bank in respect of trust receipts or invoice financing applications.

## Calling on the Defence

107    As I was of the view that there was some evidence, not inherently incredible, that satisfied each and every element of the charges, I called on the accused to enter his defence, and the accused elected to testify.

## Accused’s Evidence

108    The accused was the only witness for the Defence. He testified that he is a Chinese educated physics graduate of Nanyang University, and had previously worked for the company NOL, where he was in charge of its operations for the East Asia region, and exposed to international trade. He left NOL in 1975 and started a shipping company where he was involved with until 1977. He then incorporated Intraluck on 27 September 1978, and became the managing director (“MD”). Intraluck carried on business until 2016 when it was ordered to be wound up as a result of events related to the present proceedings.

109    The main business of Intraluck in 2015 and 2016 was dealing with aluminium alloy. In 2016, the company’s paid up capital was $12 million and it was the biggest aluminium importer in Singapore.

##### Intraluck’s dealing with the banks

110    The accused said that he was the main person in Intraluck who dealt with the banks regarding loans for Intraluck. He said that he dealt with the superiors of the RMs regarding Intraluck’s banking facilities, and would sign the banking facility letters issued by the banks.

111    Where only one director of Intraluck was needed to sign applications made to the bank, the accused would be the one who does this. Mdm Neo, who was the only other director of Intraluck, would not sign any loan application for Intraluck by herself, nor would she be asked to provide personal guarantee for the facilities granted by the banks to Intraluck, as she was really just a long term employee of Intraluck. In fact, the accused confirmed that she was made a director to satisfy ACRA's requirements on the number of directors the company needed to have. Mdm Neo was also given shares in Intraluck as a reward for her long service to Intraluck, and the accused was effectively her boss.Thus, where the board of directors have to approve decisions for things like loans, and bank finance matters that Intraluck engages in, it was really the accused’s decision, as he was also the major shareholder.He agreed that he has to have an oversight of the loan applications that Intraluck makes because he is the MD and also as he signs the personal guarantees. In addition,he makes the decision on which banks to approach for any particular loan.

112    The accused described his understanding of international trade as such: there are three types of payments that the traditional banks depend on.: by letters of credit, DA (delivery against acceptance) and DP (delivery against payment). The accused also said that he was familiar with documents like BLs,and also with how a trust receipt (TR) works. He said that a TR is not required to be signed for invoice financing transactions.

113    The accused further said that in China, the exporter and the supplier are usually different parties because the latter may not have a licence to export so they have to go through an exporter agent company. Thus, on the BL, the shipper’s name (“exporter’s agent”) would be indicated, while on the invoice, the company’s name would be different, as it would be that of the supplier. The accused stated that the invoice would indicate the BL number, and the BL would indicate the invoice number, to show that these documents are connected.

114    The accused said that either the supplier or the exporter would hand the BL to their banks. After the documents are checked, the loading port’s banks would hand them to the importer’s bank in Singapore. The main documents are the BL, the invoice and the application forms. He said that that the banks check that the BL and invoice numbers match because the description in the BL would usually be brief, whereas the invoice would have a clearer description. Before the bank hands the original documents to the importer, they would affix a stamp on the back of the BL to indicate that the rights and titles of the goods are transferred to the buyer. When the importer wants to retrieve the BL, the bank would make them sign a TR, and sometimes also a bill of exchange to indicate what they owe the bank. The TR shows that the “bill of title” has been transferred to the importer, and that they owe the bank money.

115    However, the accused said that for the past 10 over years, they have not been using this method of payment, which takes about 10-12 days for the money to be paid by the importer bank to the shipper or exporter bank. Instead, Intraluck has only been carrying out invoice financing, which uses another method that speeds up payment to the suppliers. For such a form of financing, the buyer would submit the application form with the invoice, which was issued to the buyer by the supplier. When the supplier issues the invoice to Intraluck for the supply of goods, Intraluck would apply to one of its banks to finance that invoice. That invoice would state, among other things, the description of the goods as well as the amount of money to be supported by that invoice. The accused also said that the bank must have pre-approved the supplier (i.e. that it must be on a list of pre-approved suppliers) or, in the case of UOB and DBS, it must be a supplier accepted by the bank. The bank would then transfer (“TT”) the money to the designated account of the supplier. The accused also explained that for the loan, Intraluck must have sufficient credit facilities in its account with the bank. Further, the conditions that the bank imposed for such financing was that the accused, as the MD of Intraluck, must provide a personal guarantee for the facility.

116    In the invoice financing application form, the accused must also provide the details of the invoice and the account of the supplier, and he would also have to declare that he abides by two conditions. First, that he would not apply for loans from other banks before or after the application. Second that the business transaction evidenced by the invoice is genuine. [^36]

117    The accused said that for invoice financing, the bank would pay directly to the supplier and Intraluck would not receive any money from the bank. The accused said that all banks also required his personal guarantee for the credit facility that they provided to Intraluck and that all the banks that he dealt with only provided invoice financing and no other facilities. The exception was DBS, which also has a mortgage on the buildings for the loans taken by his associated companies. The accused said that in all cases of invoice financing, the bank would look to Intraluck for repayment and not to any other party.

118    In the case of trade between China and Taiwan, because these countries were “always quarrelling with each other”, they use a third party i.e. Singapore, which is taken to have bought the goods from China, and then sells it to Taiwan, or to another country. The accused also explained that goods could be transhipped from China to Hong Kong, and then transported to Taiwan. However, if the goods are to be sent to ASEAN countries or to Australia, the transhipment would take place in Singapore.

119    The accused said that for invoice financing involving such transhipment situations, the original shipper in China which ships the goods to Hong Kong would have an original BL but that this is not provided to the discharging port in Hong Kong. Instead, it is kept by the shipping agent in China. When the goods are then shipped from Hong Kong to Taiwan, there is a second BL which is kept by the shipping agent in Hong Kong and not provided to the party in Taiwan. He said that there is no need to enclose a copy of the BL for the application for invoice financing because Intraluck is the consignee so the BL title belongs to Intraluck and not to the bank. This is in contrast to the DA/DP and the letter of credit situations, where for the consignee section, it actually states "to the order of the bank", and the bank holds the BL as the document of title. So for DA/DP and letters of credit, the bank would require the BL. The accused also said that there is nothing stated on the application form that the BL is required, and there isn’t any part on the form where the BL number is to be put in. Neither does the supplier invoice require the BL number to be stated.

120    The accused further testified that the suppliers named in the charges, namely Nummary International, Lidong Aluminium, and Solid Vallation were all known to him in the course of doing business in China.

##### Claim that he did not provide BLs for invoice financing applications

121    As regards the facility letter issued by DBS for invoice financing, while the accused acknowledged that the facility letter stated that it contains terms and conditions, he insisted that “This is what is written there. However, I treated it as a guideline. Because the conditions are subject to changes.”[^37]The accused took the same position with respect to the facility letters issued by all the banks (AE4 from KBC, AE 5 from Citibank, AE6 from OCBC, AE7 from ANZ, and AE10 from HSBC), that were named in the charges as having been allegedly cheated by him, insisting that the “terms and conditions” set out in the facility letters were “a guideline” to him,[^38] which he was not required to follow, and which were not binding even though he had signed on these facility letters.[^39]

122    The accused also said that for invoice financing, the only documents that he needed to submit are the application from and the invoice, and that no other document was required. Specifically, he insisted that no BL needs to be submitted, and it has always been the case that all applications for invoice financing do not require a BL to be provided. He said that this was the situation in September 2015 and remains the situation to date.

123    When the DPP pointed out to the accused that numerous witnesses from the banks had said that there is a requirement for the transport documents/BLs to be submitted together with the application form and invoice for invoice financing applications, the accused disagreed and said that all these witnesses were wrong, again insisting that this was not stated in the terms and conditions of the invoice financing application form.[^40]

124    When queried, the accused acknowledged that a BL and an invoice are different documents which serve different purposes, although he insisted that an invoice is a must, but for the BL “you can choose not to because it's not required.”[^41]The accused also said that when a ship comes in with the goods, there was no need for Intraluck to present the original BL to receive the goods, nor does he need the BL for invoice financing. When asked why Intraluck would then need to have a BL at all, the accused said that the staff would know. He further stated that he does not know why there was a need for him to certify the bill of lading as a true copy, although he subsequently claimed that “(m)aybe the custom need it or maybe other government authorities need it.”[^42]

125    When queried about the contents of various invoice application forms that he had signed, including those from DBS and Citibank, all of which also contained statements that transport documents were attached to the applications, the accused gave the following responses.

> (a)     For P13 (application form to DBS bank) where it was stated that the application enclosed a bill of lading and an invoice, the accused claimed that the details in the application form were filled in by his staff and his job was just “…to check whether the invoice number is correct, who I'm paying the money to and the amount stated. I did not pay attention to these little details.” He also insisted that the bank did not require him to provide the BL “(b)ecause for invoice financing, it's a new product, a new concept. The bank already knew that we do not have this copy of the bill of lading. So for this new product, the bill of lading is not a requirement.”[^43]The accused also claimed that he did not know if a BL was included, although he insisted that when he signed the application he did not see it then. This despite the fact that he confirmed that the BL had his signature in the box “CERTIFIED TRUE COPY" on the BL included in P13.[^44]

> (b)     For P5 (application form to Citibank) where it was stated that “We enclose original invoice number ESY-0191192 dated 11-09-2015 “and transport documents and/or other necessary documents," the accused claimed not to have noticed this. Instead, he stated that “…when I was auditing this document, I only took note of the invoice number and also the invoice date and also to whom the money was paid to. As for the rest of the content, those content were printed. As such, I did not pay attention to them. Because there were too many words, so when I was signing the document, it was not possible for me to go through every word.” [^45] Further, when queried about the fact that page 4 of P5 contains the BL, and that there is a stamp on page 5 that states “Certified true copy” which he had signed, the accused conceded that he did signed in that box, which he said that the stuff had applied on the document.[^46]

##### Processing of documents in Intraluck

126    The accused said that as the MD of Intraluck, the BLs that come to the office were never handed to him, but it was always his staff who dealt with them. Only the TR was passed to him to sign the acceptance, before they were handed over to the bank by his staff. He also said that prior to October 2015, it was Ms Cheah who handled this, and this role was taken over by Ms Cheah’s assistant after she resigned.

127    As for invoices from suppliers, the accused said that his staff would bring him the documents to approve and he would check that the goods he ordered were on the way to him. He also needed to verify the description of the goods and the price was the same as the purchase order to the supplier. Further, he would verify that the account number of suppliers was correct before the bank transfers the money. After all these details on an invoice were verified as correct, he would approve and hand it to someone from the accounts or finance department and tell them to make payment when the time comes.

128    For invoice financing, a member of the staff, as decided by Ms Cheah, would prepare the application form for the bank that the accused had selected to finance the invoice. The application would then be sent to the accused for his signature and also to Mdm Neo, if her signature was also required, before being processed by the finance department. The accused said that the application and invoice would then be faxed or posted over, and the original or copies would be kept in Intraluck’s office. The accused said that he has never seen Mdm Neo herself fax over the application and the invoice to the bank, and neither has he done so himself. Instead this is handed over to the staff to do. He further stated that he does not know how to operate a fax machine.

129    The accused said that in the application forms, it was indicated that the contact persons were either Mdm Neo alone, or Mdm Neo and Ms Cheah. This was because Mdm Neo is in charge of the credit limit, while Ms Cheah was in charge of all administrative matters. Their names were inserted in the application form by the staff who prepared the application.

130    The accused said that if there was a need for a BL to be refaxed to the bank, the bank would contact Ms Cheah, and that he has never been contacted by any of the banks for clarification in respect of invoice financing. Further, the accused said that he never told Ms Cheah or Ms Nah to forward a BL with the application for invoice financing, and if such a document had been forwarded and there was a discrepancy, the bank would contact Ms Cheah.

131    When asked about Ms Cheah, he said that when she resigned, she did not tell him her reason for doing so, nor did she say that she was leaving to join a company that sold the same type of products as Intraluck. Similarly, Ms Nah who left shortly afterwards, also did not tell him why she left. In addition, a few other girls left as well. When shown the FIR (P11) made by Ms Cheah, the accused said that he saw this document only in 2019 about 2 or 3 months before his trial commenced. The accused claimed that the contents of the FIR were false, in particular Ms Cheah’s allegation that he had photocopied a BL and asked her to refax the same BL to about 6 banks sometime in September 2015. The accused also said that none of the banks had asked or contacted him about refaxing BLs to them. In any event, if there was any administrative action to be taken by the banks as regards Intraluck, they would have contacted Ms Cheah since she was head of the department at that time, and her name was indicated in the application form.

132    The accused also denied having used any fictitious purchase invoice and claimed that all the invoices that he had used for the purpose of invoice financing were genuine documents. Further, he denied the claim in P11 allegedly made by Ms Nah that Mdm Neo had typed purchase invoices of her own, or that she had company stamps of suppliers in her office. When asked if he was aware why Ms Cheah would file the alleged false police report P11, the accused suggested that it may be because she wanted to compete with Intraluck for business, having joined a rival aluminium company, and also having started two other companies that dealt with the same business as Intraluck.

##### Raid on Intraluck and the statements that he gave

133    When the accused was asked about his arrest on 29 August 2016, he said that the IO had gone to his house early that morning when he had just woken up. At that time, he had not yet had his breakfast, and had just taken a pill for his diabetic condition. The IO had then told him to go with him to Intraluck’s office without explaining why.

134    At the office, they searched his room but the IO did not come out with anything from his room. Specifically, the accused said that he did not see the IO holding onto the stamp P14. He said that he only knew about P14 when it was produced during the trial, even though he had signed a form acknowledging its recovery. The accused said that he had signed this when his staff told him to do so, but added that he was not questioned about the stamp during investigations.

135    The accused said that he left the office with the IO and another officer to the CAD around noon. By then, he had still not taken his breakfast and was feeling very hungry. He said that the IO subsequently interviewed him and recorded a statement from him.

136    In all, four s 22 statements were recorded from the accused on 29 August, 31 August, 7 October and 8 October 2016. These statements (P19, P20, P21 and P22) were voluntarily made by the accused, and were tendered by the Prosecution in evidence. In addition, the accused also tendered six “cautioned statements” (D7, D8, D9, D10, D11 and D12) for the Defence. The contents of all six cautioned statements were effectively the same.

#### a)   First Statement P19

137    When questioned about the first statement recorded on 29 August 2016 (P19), the accused said that he arrived at the CAD at 12 plus pm with the IO, and the statement recording commenced at 12.26 pm. The accused said that he felt hungry and giddy because he had taken his diabetes medicine but not his breakfast. The accused said that the recorder, ASP Yue noticed his condition, saw that he was uncomfortable, and asked if he needed water. ASP Yue also asked the accused whether he needed him to get some food. Further, ASP Yue told the accused that if he felt uncomfortable, he could come back another day.

138    However, the accused did not reply to ASP Yue’s questions about whether he needed the latter to get food, or about whether he needed water. In fact, throughout the statement recording, the accused did not ask for food or water. Instead, he asked how long it would take for the IO to question him. When the IO said that he would only be asking the accused some questions regarding the operation of his company, and that this would be quite fast, the accused said that he felt that he wanted to complete the whole process. The accused also claimed that the IO informed him that there would be video and audio recording, and even pointed to the back of the room, where the accused saw a black round item on the ceiling.

139    The accused was referred to the statement at the beginning of P19, where it was indicated that the IO was “…conducting an investigation into the offence of Cheating, under Section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224, alleged to have been committed in Singapore in 2015 - 2016. You are bound to state fully the facts and circumstances with which you are acquainted concerning the case save only that you may be decline to say anything that might expose you to a criminal charge, penalty or forfeiture”. The accused claimed that this warning was not read out to him. In any event, the accused said that the IO did not explain to him what section 420 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 was, nor did he say who had committed the offence of cheating, or who was alleged to have been cheated. In fact, the IO did not tell him what the case was about at any time, but only said that he would ask the accused some questions about the operation of Intraluck, and that it would be fast. The accused further claimed that the IO had said that he was sorry to ask the accused these questions because he was the MD of the company. He said that the IO did not record down all the details that the accused told him.

140    As for the contents of question 1, where it was written “Are you feeling well enough to provide your statement”, the accused claimed that the IO had asked this because he knew that the accused was uncomfortable and could see that the accused was pale, as he had not taken any food and was feeling giddy.

141    The accused also said that as he answered the IO’s questions, the latter would type into his computer but the accused did not know what was typed. The accused confirmed that the information in the answers to questions 2 - 4 were accurate, but as for question 5, the answer was incorrect as he had said that the sources of funding was through invoice financing with multiple banks, and had not mentioned TRs, even though this was the answer that the IO had typed in. The accused also said that he does not have TR arrangements with any bank, and that a TR was never executed for invoice financing. He said that the IO had confused the concept of TR with invoice financing.[^47]

142    As for the answer to question 6, the accused further claimed that it was inaccurate as he had informed the IO that they made a profit on transhipment and that this was on top of the interest of 1 to 1.5%. In court, the accused clarified that this profit made was actually 2%, for a total of 3 to 3.5% in all. As for the answer to question 7, the accused denied that he had stated the part of the answer about the TR applications to be repaid, and insisted that he had informed the IO about invoice financing applications instead. However, he said that the rest of the answer was correct. He also confirmed the answer to question 8 to be correct. As for question 9, the accused said that the banks that he indicated as being the ones that Intraluck has trade financing facilities with were correct, but that the reference to TR applications there should read as invoice financing instead. As for question 10, the accused said that the entire answer there was correct save that he had also said that the application would be posted and faxed out by his staff, and not merely that it would be posted/faxed out. In addition, he confirmed the answers to questions 11, 12, 14, and 19 to be correct.

143    As for the answer to question 13, the accused claimed that he had not said to the IO that a BL was required to be furnished for invoice financing applications. As regards question 17, the accused agreed that he had said that he was aware that he was not allowed to submit the same BL for more than one bank application, but denied that he had given the rest of the answer.

144    For question 18,[^48] the accused denied that this question was even asked of him. Instead, what was allegedly asked was whether the declaration that he had made in the application form was genuine. Further, the accused denied that he had stated the answer to question 18 that appears in the statement, namely his admission and explanation as to why he had made an untrue declaration. As for question 20, the accused claimed that he did not tell the IO that the buyers did not export any actual goods to Intraluck to Singapore. As for question 21, the accused responded that he had said “we” rather than “they” meaning that it was Intraluck that sold the goods to the buyers in Hong Kong, Taiwan or China. As regards question 22, the accused agreed that the IO had asked: "How much of such trust receipt financing applications have you made each month on behalf of Intraluck?", but he said he had responded by saying that he would make invoice financing applications. As for question 23, the accused agreed that the IO had asked the question but said that the IO left out the part where he had said “or they will post to me in Singapore”.[^49]

145    As for question 24, the accused denied that the IO had asked the question stated. Instead, he claimed that the IO had showed him a certified true copy of a Pacific International Lines (PIL) BL, and asked who had forged the BL, to which the accused had responded that it was a genuine BL.

146    The accused claimed that question 26 (which was about Mdm Neo) was asked, but denied that question 27 (“What is her involvement in this scheme?") was asked. Instead, the accused said that what was asked was about Mdm Neo’s role in the company. However, the accused agreed that the answer recorded was accurate. As for question 28, the accused said that he had not stated that "I am the only one in the know as this is a rather sensitive business." Instead, he had answered by saying that: “In business I do not have to tell my staff openly what I was dealing with. Because every department have their own job scope, so I do not have to let them know about this openly, that's all I said.” [^50] As for question 29, the accused said that he was not asked this question at all, and neither had he answered “yes”.

147    In addition, the accused said that the IO had then taken his computer and returned only about ½ hour later when the accused was feeling sleepy. The IO had then asked the accused to check his particulars and also said that the contents of the statement was what was said during the interview.

148    The accused said that he then pointed out to the IO that his nationality was wrongly stated to be Chinese, when he is a Singaporean, and he was allowed to make the amendment and signed across the amendment. The accused, however claimed that the statement was not read back to him, nor was the endorsement at the end of the statement read. The accused said that he therefore did not make any amendments to the statement but just signed because the “the impression that IO gave \[the accused\] is that he's a very good young man.” [^51]

149    Subsequently, the accused said that the IO’s superior entered the room, spoke to him politely and told him that he had co-operated with the team and that they had managed to conduct the recording fast. The superior also said that the he knew that the accused was felling unwell and told him to ask his wife to bail him out. The accused claimed that he quickly signed the statement without looking at it as the superior had allegedly said that the accused could go back very quickly. He also said that on the morning when he gave his statement, his blood sugar was very low as he had taken medication to lower his blood sugar level, and he did not have a chance to eat anything.

150    Following this, the IO returned the accused his handphone and he called his wife. The accused claimed that this superior left and another superior came, read the statement, and told the IO to let the accused tell his wife to bring $400,000-$500,000 for bail. After that superior left, the IO told the accused that $200,000 would suffice. Later, the accused was bailed out by his wife.

#### b)   Second Statement P20

151    On the following day (30 August 2016), the IO called him to go to CAD on 31 August 2016. The accused arrived on that date after lunch, following which another statement (P20) was recorded from him. The statement recording commenced at 2.18 pm and it concluded at 3.30 pm. The accused said that the IO did not administer the warning to him, or explain to him what section 420 of the Penal Code was, or about the details of the cheating set out in the warning on P20. The accused said that the IO again asked him if he was well enough to give his statement because the IO could see that he was tired.

152    As for question 31, in which the accused was recorded as having given a lengthy answer, the accused said that what was recorded was accurate except for the second paragraph of the answer where it was recorded that he allegedly said that that the Chinese partners had difficulty getting loans in their own country and had asked him to use Intraluck’s name to get loans. This allegedly involved them giving invoices falsely stating that they had sold goods to Intraluck (even though no goods were delivered to Singapore) so as to get financing from Singapore banks which was easier. The accused also denied making the alleged statement that he started applying for invoice financing to help out his Chinese friends and to gain some commission. In fact, according to the accused, after he said what appears as paragraph 1 of the answer to question 31, the IO went on to ask the next question. [^52]

153    As for question 32, the accused admitted that this question was asked of him and that the invoice referred to in the question was also shown to him. However, he denied giving the answer set out in P20, especially the part where he was alleged to have said that for the application to Maybank, he simply chose a BL, which date was closest to the dated indicated in the invoice, to submit in the application. He also denied having said the words: “Because the bank will only grant a loan if they see a BL but in this case, no goods was actually delivered to Singapore." In addition, he denied having told the IO that: “So I just send a BL from another deal as part of the application to get the approval." Later, the accused clarified that what appears as question 32, was actually a series of three questions pertaining to the invoice issued by Nummary and about how payment was made to Nummary.[^53]

154    As for question 33, the accused denied having told the IO that the invoice from Intraluck (YRS12) was issued for the same goods by Solid Vallation. The accused also said that the IO had shown him the invoice and asked if the goods that he bought from Nummary were then sold to Solid Vallation. The accused had said if the reference number was the same then it was correct. However, he denied telling the IO that “Nummary will then inform me which buyer to bill, in this case, to bill Solid Vallation." Neither had he told the IO that the invoice issued to Solid Vallation covered that amount loaned to Nummary, in addition to the interest to be paid to the lending bank. He also denied that he had handed the Intraluck invoice to Nummary on his overseas trip and claimed that he sent it directly to Solid Vallation instead. In fact, he said that there was no reason for him to issue Nummary with an invoice.

155    As for his answer to question 36, the accused denied saying that the profit from “…doing the transhipment business can also be high as high as 60-70 per cent of my company's annual profit”. Instead, the accused claimed that he had said that international trading, like transhipment and reshipment, accounted for the main part of Intraluck’s turnover (not its profit) of about 60 to 70 per cent, while the local business in Singapore accounted for about 30 to 40 percent of its turnover. While the accused agreed that his answers about Mdm Neo in questions 38 and 39 were correct, he denied the part of his answer to question 39 where he was alleged to have said that he was the one who got the invoices from the Chinese businessmen during his travel there and that he had then passed them to his staff. The accused, however, agreed that he had told the IO in his answer to question 40, namely that Mdm Neo doesn’t know much about Intraluck’s business, including its import business.

156    At the end of the statement taking, the accused denied that the statement was read back to him either in English or Mandarin, or that he had been offered the opportunity to make amendments to his statement. When asked why he had signed the statement, the accused answered that he did not see any of the contents that would cause any harm to him, and also that the IO just told him to sign. So he did not go through the whole statement, but just signed and left. He also said that he was very tired at that time. The accused further said that while he was diagnosed with cancer in 2018, he was told that the cancer was already at its initial stage in 2014.

157    The accused also disclosed that after P20 was given on 31 August 2016, he had met the banks in September 2016 which found out about the raid by the CAD. Following this, he was given 21 days’ notice by OCBC to repay his loans. The accused said that he then wound up his company.

#### c)   Third Statement P21

158    The third statement (P21) was given on 7 October 2016. Again, there was an error made by the IO about the accused’s nationality and the accused had to correct this and initial against it. The accused claimed that the entire statement took only ½ hour to 45 minutes to complete, even though the statement recording was indicated to have taken one hour and 45 minutes. He accused also claimed that the entire statement was pre-printed and was merely shown to him when he arrived. Further, the accused was merely asked to confirm whether the contents of the statement was correct. He also said that the IO did not tell him what offence had been committed, who cheated or who was cheated, nor did the IO reveal the manner of cheating. The accused said that at that time, he did not know whether any allegation of cheating was being made against Intraluck or against the accused personally.

159    On the first question (question 41), where it was written that the IO had asked the accused if he was well enough to provide a statement, the accused said that this question was asked because the IO, who was a “nice person”, should know about his condition as he was feeling very tired every day, and that “even when \[he\] drive, \[he\] also nearly doze off”. [^54]

160    On questions 42 and 43, the accused claimed that the IO did not ask him the questions, and also said that the printed answers were already typed out when the statement taking took place. This was also the case for question 47, which was purportedly a question about a BL being used as a supporting document. The accused said that the IO did not ask him the question but just told him to check the stack of documents for the BL number and whether the figure was correct.

161    The accused further said that endorsement at the end of the statement - that the statement was made voluntarily, that no one had induced, promised or threatened him into making it and that it had been read over to him in Mandarin - was not actually read to him in either Mandarin or English. Further, before he signed the statement, he had asked the IO about question 47 and whether that implied that it was he who did it. The accused allegedly also said to the IO that he was not the one, to which the “ IO then told me that he understood from the statement recorded on 29 August as well as 31 August that I was not the one who did it and it was the staff who actually faxed it out on their own.” The IO had allegedly also said that “…you're the MD so you have to be responsible for it". The accused said that he had no choice but to sign the statement. [^55]

#### d)   Fourth Statement P22

162    The final s 22 statement (P22) was given on 18 October 2016. The accused said that his nationality was correctly indicated as ‘Singaporean’ this time. The start time of the statement was indicated as 2.05 pm, and the end time as 2.30 pm. This for a 11-page statement. The accused said that he was not asked question 127 about whether he had submitted a particular BL, and he also denied that he had answered yes. Instead, the accused said that he was just asked to look at the BL number and told to audit accordingly. By auditing, the accused said that the IO had asked him to take a look at the BL number and then check on the bank application number to see whether they matched.

163    The accused also denied that the statement was read back to him in Mandarin. He further said by the end of the statement, he was not informed of the nature of the CAD investigations, who was cheated or who did the cheating. Further, he did not have any contact with CAD for the rest of 2016.

164    The accused insisted that when the invoice financing documents were given to Mdm Neo and him to sign, the BL was not attached. Also, he said that as far as he knew, the BL was not required to be put in with the application, and that the documents were either faxed, posted or handed over to the bank by the girls, but he did not know what they had faxed, handed or posted over. [^56]

165    The accused said that upon the instruction of the IO, he went back to CAD on 16 November 2017 when he was served with 584 charges. The accused was then given an opportunity to write his reaction for the 1st charge, which he did in Mandarin. The IO also told the accused that the other charges were the same and the accused did not object to having his explanation duplicated for all the subsequent charges.

166    When queried about the contents of D14, the accused said that he does not think that the terms and conditions of the bank had specified what documents had to be provided for invoice financing. As for the fact that he had made reference to the TR due to the bank in D14, the accused clarified that he had done so because when the IO questioned him, “he was going round the TR concept. So I had to use such explanation to let him understand.” [^57] The accused said that he was subsequently charged in court.

##### Response to each charge

167    On further questioning by his counsel, the accused reiterated that a BL was not required for invoice financing and that the application was prepared by his administrative staff (either Ms Cheah or Ms Nah) and that when he signed the application, he did not instruct his girls to enclose a BL. As such, he does not know why they had done so. [^58]

168    As regards the 16th charge involving the cheating of DBS, he had fulfilled the warranty given to the banks in the invoice financing application that: (1) there is a genuine, underlying transaction for the sale/purchase of the goods; (2) that he would at their request provide other documents evidencing the transaction; (3) that Intraluck has not obtained and shall not obtain any other form of type of financing from any other party other than from the bank for the Goods or the Letter of Credit; and (4) that they will repay the bank the full amount of loan of refinancing extended to Intraluck on due date as well as all outstanding interest, charges and commissions due to the bank. The accused also said that the BL from Orient Overseas Container Line that was enclosed with the application to DBS was not requested by the bank, and the girls should not have included it when they handed over or faxed the application for invoice financing. The accused said that he was not contacted by the bank for this application. He also confirmed that the invoice attached to the application did not state the BL number and vice versa.

169    As for the 17th charge which involved the cheating of KBC, the accused denied that KBC had provided a TR facility for Intraluck, and insisted that only invoice financing was provided. He also said that as far as he could recall, KBC had not requested Intraluck to furnish original documents of the transaction for their inspection. The accused further said that there were no shipping documents or documents of title handed over by the bank to him or to Intraluck. The accused also testified that notwithstanding what was stated on the TR for KBC, for invoice financing transactions, the goods were not pledged to the bank and there was no request by the bank for the goods to be pledged. The TR also did not need to be signed by Intraluck. However, the accused admitted that he did sign the attached TR allegedly because his staff had already filled in the documents beforehand and he did not go through them, and also because the bank wanted it.[^59]

170    As for the 18th charge involving Citibank, the accused said that the application was prepared by his staff, and that the declarations contained in it were true. He said that there was no mention in the application for a BL to be submitted, and he had not instructed his staff to include the BL. He also did not know why they had done so. The accused further confirmed that the invoice attached to the application did not state the BL number and vice versa.

171    As for the 19th charge involving OCBC bank, the accused also said that the application form was filled in by his girls. He said that he does not recall OCBC asking him to provide documents other than the invoice. The accused believed the invoice for this transaction was from Norinco as it was the export agent, but the payment was to be made to Nummary as it was the supplier. The accused confirmed that he had certified the BL that was attached to the application and said that he had done so because his staff had passed it to him to sign and he just signed as he “saw that the description in the bill of lading was correct, so there was no reason for my staff to cheat me.” [^60] He said that BL did not refer to an invoice number.

172    As for the 20th charge which involved ANZ, the accused said that the application form was filled in by his girls after downloading it from the Internet. He said that it was his girls who ticked the box "Copy of Transport Document", although he said that he does not know why they had done so. He said that he had approved the attached invoice, which made no mention of a BL number. There was also a TR attached which he had signed, although he said that ANZ did not hold any documents of title with regards to the goods stated in the invoice. Nevertheless, he had signed on the TR because “(g)enerally, if the bank requires any document to be signed we will just sign.”[^61]The accused claimed that he did not instruct his girls to submit this BL to ANZ, together with the application for invoice financing. He also said the BL number did not refer to an invoice number.

173    As for the 21st charge which involved HSBC, the accused also said that the application form was filled in by his girls. The invoice was by Lidong Aluminium and the payment was to be made to Lidong’s account in Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Taiwan. He had signed on the application and the contact persons were indicated as Mdm Neo or Ms Cheah. He said that the information was typed in by his staff. The BL attached was the same BL from Orient Overseas Container Line, although the accused said that he had not instructed his girls to enclose this in the application for financing with HSBC. The accused claimed that HSBC had also not asked Intraluck for transport documents such as delivery order or a BL because these documents were not required for invoice financing. He insisted that “HSBC has “…never required a bill of lading”. [^62] The accused also confirmed that the invoice attached to the application did not state the BL number and vice versa.

174    The accused insisted that he did not cheat any of the banks stated in the six charges, nor did he deceive them that about the BL. He also insisted that even for post-shipment financing of invoices, no BL was required, just as in the case of pre-shipment invoice financing.

175    The accused also produced a document dated 23 December 2019 called a “Original Bill of Lading Surrender Notice” addressed to another company called Fosan Hehong Trading Development Co. Ltd. from Pacific International Lines (PIL), Shenzhen (D16), which he said showed that the agent at the loading port had already collected the BL.

## Main aspects of Prosecution’s submissions

176    The Prosecution submitted that the evidence led through representatives of UOB, showed that Intraluck had made the UOB application for a trade financing loan on 9 September 2015. This application was accompanied by an invoice from Norinco New Energy Co. Ltd for 23,129.19kg of aluminium extrusions, at a price of USD 60,415.51, and a transport document, being AN080 that referenced BL080. The accused had signed on the UOB application, together with the co-director Mdm Neo. The legitimacy of this application to UOB was not disputed.

177    Separately, as specified in the underlying facility letter and/or as was referred to in the application forms pertaining to the Applications with the banks, the requirement was that together with the invoice relating to the application, Intraluck has to submit a transport document such as a BL or AN as a supporting document in each of the application forms. Such a supporting document was needed to show that goods referred to therein, which corresponded with the goods set out in the invoice, had been shipped to Intraluck in Singapore.

178    Following the UOB application, between 10 September 2015 and 15 September 2015, Intraluck made the Applications for separate invoice financing applications to the banks that are the subject matter of the six charges. For each of these applications, the respective application form, which the accused had signed (together with Mdm Neo in some cases), was accompanied by an invoice from a supplier (as set out in \[4\] of the ASOF\]), and either BL080, or AN080.

179    Pursuant to the Applications and relying on BL080 (in the case of the DBS, Citibank, OCBC, ANZ and HSBC), or AN080 (in the case of KBC) that were submitted as part of the Applications, each of the six banks had approved the respective invoice financing application and had disbursed the sum to the beneficiaries listed in the application.

180    The Prosecution highlighted that the evidence of the representatives of the six banks, clearly showed that the practice of the banks for invoice financing applications, was to check for the transport document, and that if it had not been provided, the application would be rejected, or the customer would be asked to provide some transport document to support the application. This showed that there was reliance by each bank, as an entity, on the transport document to evidence an actual shipment of goods, before it would finance such a loan.

181    In addition to the evidence of the bank representatives and the evidence of former members and the co-director of Intraluck, the Prosecution argued that the four s 22 statements of the accused, which the accused agreed had been voluntarily made, were accurately recorded by the IO, ASP Yue. The contents of these statements were also corroborated by the objective evidence, such as the accused’s signatures on the copies of BL080 and AN080 submitted, and the testimony of the Prosecution’s witnesses, and the Defence has not established any basis to doubt their accuracy. These statements contained clear and comprehensive admissions of the scheme which the accused had devised. They specifically showed that:

> (a)     Intraluck had provided “transhipment and agency services”, wherein Intraluck used the invoice financing facilities granted to it by Singapore banks to finance transactions between buyers and sellers located in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, thus allowing the buyers to overcome difficulties in getting finance in their own name.

> (b)     This process involved an arrangement between the seller and the accused for Intraluck to finance a sale of goods between the seller and buyer, whereby the seller provided the accused with an invoice issued to Intraluck (even through the true sale was to the buyer and not to Intraluck). The accused then decided which bank to submit the application to, and also chose a BL to submit with the application, as he knew that the banks required a BL as a supporting document.

> (c)     However, as no goods were in fact exported to Singapore/Intraluck, no BL or AN was received by Intraluck for the goods. Thus, the accused chose a BL from one of Intraluck’s genuine import transactions with the date closest to the date of the invoice, and gave instructions for the application to be submitted with that BL. The submission was made to a bank decided by the accused.

> (d)     Upon the approval of the application, the bank paid the seller, and Intraluck then issued an invoice to the buyer, requiring the buyer to pay Intraluck the amount due by Intraluck to the bank, plus Intraluck’s own commission of 1%-1.5% on the sale price.

> (e)     The accused admitted to knowing that he should not have submitted the same BL for multiple applications, but he did so in order to carry on the “transhipment” business. He explained that he had continued with this business because it was “lucrative”, with the profit being as high as 60-70% of Intraluck’s annual revenue. He also emphasised that he was the only person who knew about this business.

> (f)     For the six charges, the accused admitted to submitting the BL for the Applications, and that the BL/AN submitted was taken from the genuine import transaction that was financed by the UOB application.

## Main aspects of Defence’s submissions

182    The Defence’s arguments can be broadly summarised as follows:[^63]

> (a)     As regards the _actus reus_ of the offence, the Defence argued that there was no evidence adduced that the accused had submitted the applications for invoice financing with copies of the BL stated in all the six charges and/or had directed his staff to do so, and /or that he was aware that the BL had been submitted by a member or members of Intraluck's staff together with the applications for invoice financing. Instead, the Defence highlighted that the preparation of the applications for submission to the banks was part of the administrative duty of Ms Cheah and Ms Nah, and it was also the staff, rather than the accused or Mdm Neo, who would transmit them to the banks after they had been signed by the accused and/or Mdm Neo.

> (b)     In addition, there was no evidence that the accused had done so with the requisite _mens rea_ or knowledge that they were false. In this regard, the Defence argued that it has not been shown that the six transactions reflected in the suppliers' invoices, which were subject matter of the six charges, were not genuine transactions.

> (c)     Further, it was argued that there was no evidence adduced that the banks had been deceived as alleged in all six charges, and had thereby been dishonestly induced to deliver the monies stated in the invoices from the suppliers. In this regard, counsel took the position that “…it cannot be the bank as a whole that was deceived; it must have been an officer of the bank who received the application with the supporting BLs who had been deceived by the fact that this BL pertained to another shipment”. [^64] Counsel further argued that “ (a)s the bank being a corporate entity, is an inanimate person, it acts only through its officers. The Defence position is that there is need on the part of the Prosecution to call the specific bank officer who processed the application who can say on behalf of the bank that he or she was deceived by the BL which was forwarded with the application for invoice financing. This is the missing link or _lacuna_ in the Prosecution’s case”.[^65]

> (d)     In addition, having regard to the invoice financing terms and conditions of the banks, it was argued that a BL was not required to be furnished in support of Intraluck's applications to the respective banks. Instead, the Defence argued that for invoice financing, the banks were only concerned with the fact that the invoice was from a pre-approved or pre-authorised supplier, and that the amount to be financed was within Intraluck’s credit facility, and that Intraluck had declared that the transactions in the invoices are genuine and have not been nor will be financed by another bank. It was not part of the bank’s terms and conditions to require a BL to be provided as evidence of shipment.

> (e)     It was also pointed out that all credit facilities granted by the banks to Intraluck were fully secured by either the properties and personal guarantee of the accused, or only on the personal guarantee of the accused, and that there was no default by Intraluck in repaying the banks with interest on due date. The Defence submitted that Intraluck had performed and fulfilled all the terms and conditions of the financing applications, and that none of the banks had complained otherwise, nor did they complain that they had been cheated by Intraluck. [^66]

> (f)     Further, the Defence took issue with the evidence of Ms Cheah and Ms Nah arguing, inter alia, that their evidence was inherently incredible, and contradicted by the evidence of Mdm Neo, including over the allegations that were made against the accused and Mdm Neo that the applications to the banks were faxed either by Mdm Neo or the accused, and over allegations that Mdm Neo had typed out purchase invoices and also possessed blank letterheads and stamps of suppliers. In addition, it was alleged that Ms Cheah and Ms Nah each had an ulterior motive in making allegations against their former employers because they were now working for rival companies of Intraluck.

> (g)     The Defence also contended that an AN is not a BL, and that none of the AN or BLs related to the invoices in the loan applications, as the invoices do not refer to a BL number, and the BL/AN do not refer to an invoice number.

> (h)     It was also pointed out that none of the staff had testified that the accused had chosen the BLs for submission with the application for invoice financing, and that no BL was found on the accused’s office and desk during the raid on Intraluck’s premises on 29 August 2016.

183    As regards the four statements of the accused recorded under s 22 of the CPC (P19-P22), the Defence argued against any weight to be accorded to their contents, _inter alia_ in light of the following:

> (a)     As regards P19-P22, no warning was given to the accused nor was caution under section 23 of the CPC administered to him. The accused was also not told that he had committed the offence of cheating or who he had allegedly cheated, when these statements were recorded from him. These statements should also not be considered in isolation but should be looked at together with the cautioned statements because it was only at the recording of the latter that the accused was “…informed of the allegations being made against him that he had cheated the banks who had been deceived by the BL thereby inducing the banks to deliver various sums of money to Intraluck’s suppliers under its invoice financing applications”. [^67]

> (b)     Further, the Defence repeated allegations made by the accused wherein he had disputed the accuracy of some of the answers in the statements. The Defence also alleged that ASP Yue had added in contents into the s 22 statements that were not provided by the accused. In addition, the Defence took issue with the questioning of the accused and the “unsatisfactory manner” in which the statement recording was carried out by ASP Yue, who allegedly failed to show the accused documents that accompanied the applications made to the banks.

> (c)     Thus, the Defence argued that the four statements “…are not reflective of what the accused had told the IO, and hence, they have no or little probative value against the accused. It is the Defence submission that the Court should not place any weight on these fours statements and should be disregarded totally”.[^68]

## Issues to be Determined

184    There was essentially no dispute on the legal elements of the proceeded charges. In essence, to prove each of the s 420 PC charge, the Prosecution has to show the existence of the following elements:[^69]

> (a)     That the victim was deceived;

> (b)     There must have been an inducement such that the victim delivered any property to any person; and

> (c)     There must be a dishonest or fraudulent intention on the part of the deceiving person to induce the victim to deliver the property i.e. to cheat.

185    As was made clear in the ASOF, and as was set out in the submissions of parties, it was not disputed that:

> (a)     Intraluck had submitted the Applications, and that each of the Applications was signed by the accused (and also by Mdm Neo in the case of three of the six applications);

> (b)     The Applications were sent by fax to the banks;

> (c)     Pursuant to the Applications, the banks approved the loans and disbursed the monies directly to the suppliers; and

> (d)     That Intraluck subsequently repaid the banks the money disbursed by them pursuant to the Applications.

186    Thus, in deciding whether the charges were made out, the main issues that remained to be determined were:

> (a)     Whether the accused had submitted (directly or indirectly) BL080 and AN080 in the Applications to the banks;

> (b)     Whether the accused had done so with a dishonest intention to induce the banks to deliver property; and

> (c)     Whether the banks relied on BL080 or AN080 and were deceived to approve the loans and disburse money i.e. deliver property.

## Court’s Findings on the issues

### First Issue: Submission of BL080 and AN080 to the banks

187    The Prosecution argued that the evidence showed that BL080 that was tendered to five of the six banks, and AN080 (which referred to BL080) that which was tendered to KBC, were submitted by the accused to the banks as part of the Applications. I agree. I summarise my findings below.

#### Accused would be aware of need to provide transport documents for post-shipment applications

188    It was clear that accused was the main decision maker in Intraluck and the one to whom the banks recognised and negotiated with when approving credit facilities to Intraluck. It was also clear that the accused was the person in Intraluck who signed the credit facility letters of the banks, and who had agreed to the terms set out in them. This included the requirement for a transport document making invoice financing applications were made.

##### (1)   Reasons for providing shipping documents to banks

189    As for the reason why transport documents needed to be as part of the application, it was clear that the banks only provided post-shipment invoice financing credit facilities to Intraluck i.e. financing for goods that had already been shipped to Singapore. For such forms of financing, there would always be a transport document, generally a BL, already in existence when Intraluck made the application for such financing. It was the BL (or the AN evidencing the BL) that the banks required when Intraluck made the application. As explained by the various witnesses from the banks, the BL (or AN) was needed to show that the goods had actually been shipped to Singapore. Representatives from the various banks also made it clear that the submission of a transport document for the invoice financing application was a standard and long standing requirement.

190    In exchange for providing this document, Intraluck would essentially receive longer loan tenures or more favourable terms for the loan in a post-shipment invoice financing situation. In contrast, in a situation of pre-shipment invoice financing, for which no goods had been shipped and hence no shipping documents were expected or provided to the banks, the risk to the financing bank was higher as there was the additional risk of non-shipment.

191    In the present case, as it was undisputed that Intraluck was only given the facility to make post-shipment financing applications to the banks, it only sought post-shipment (and not pre-shipment) financing. In such a situation, in exchange for the better terms offered by the banks which granted such financing, the banks expected Intraluck to provide them with the transport documents (BL or AN). Essentially, these documents assured the banks that they were assuming a lower risk for the invoice financing, as the goods had already been shipped to Singapore. In exchange for this lower risk to the banks, better loan terms were provided to Intraluck.

192    The above arrangement that Intraluck had with all the banks (as well as with UOB which was not one of the victims of the fraud), was reflected in the facility letters issued by each of the banks to Intraluck. These facility letters were received by the accused, and assented to and signed by him on behalf of Intraluck. In such circumstances, it was clear that the accused knew the banks required and wanted transport documents to be provided by Intraluck before they would provide the requested financing.

193    In short, since it was clear that Intraluck only had post-shipment and not pre-shipment financing arrangements with the banks, and since the accused, on behalf of Intraluck, ONLY sought post-shipping financing in the invoice financing applications made to them, the requirement to provide a transport document, namely a BL (or an AN referencing a BL) to the banks was undoubtedly essential.

##### (2)    Requirement stated in facility letters accused signed

194    The accused, as the MD of Intraluck, and who was indisputably the main person in Intraluck that the banks dealt with when granting the financing facilities, knew and specifically agreed to the requirement that transport documents be provided as part of the application made to them. This was specified when he signed the facility letters for each of the six banks.

195    In court, the accused, however, tried to insist that the requirement for transport documents such as the BL, was only a mere guideline. This despite the fact that such a requirement was clearly spelt out in the facility letters issued to him, and something acknowledged and signed by him. Further, he claimed ignorance about such a requirement, which was set out in the facility letters, by stating that he could not and/or did not read the small print, or that “…there's just too many words, too many sentences to know,”and/or that he did not “care much about the administrative part”.[^70]

196    Thus, when queried about his dealings with the banks, the accused’s responses were essentially that he disregarded the terms and conditions (because they were mere guidelines), or he did not even read them at all. For example:

> (a)     Even when the requirements were stated as “TERMS & CONDITIONS” (such as in the case of DBS’s invoice financing P13), he continued to insist that except for the terms and conditions specified in application form itself “…the rest of the letters that were sent to me, they were just guidelines to me.”[^71]

> (b)     He did, however, appear to admit that in the case of Citibank, terms and conditions for the banking facilities that Citibank extended to Intraluck, were contained in the facility letter (AE5), where it stated that it was "subject to these terms and conditions set out below".[^72]

> (c)     When asked about the facility letter from OCBC (AE6), the accused stated that he did not even need to look at AE6 at all.[^73]When asked why then would the bank issue the facility letter (AE6) to Intraluck and also get him to sign on them, the accused’s reply was that “(y)ou will need to ask the bank”[^74]He then suggested that the ‘guideline’ in the letter was to let him know what kind of facilities were offered to him,[^75] and insisted that he did not need to follow the terms and conditions in the facility letters, nor were they binding on him.[^76]

> (d)     As for the facility letters from KBC (AE4) which stated that Intraluck had to submit a bill of lading or notice of arrival for invoice financing loans, and also the fact that the accused had signed on page 3 of the document to confirm his acceptance of the facility offered “on the terms and conditions stipulated above", the accused said that he signed to show that he accepted the guidelines stated, but again insisted that he needed to refer back to the invoice financing terms and conditions instead.

> (e)     As for AE7, which was the facility letter for ANZ, where it was similarly stated that aside from the invoice, Intraluck has to provide a transport document or contract of sale, the accused had also signed at page 4 of the facility letter stating that "Each obligor agrees to the terms and conditions of this Facility letter ... and acknowledges that it is bound by the terms and conditions thereof." Despite this, the accused claimed that: “All along, when I deal with ANZ, they do not require this particular document...Before ANZ, it was Amro Bank and they have never requested for this document.”[^77]When there was a second supplemental facility letter from ANZ issued in 2013, which contained an amended second condition that stated that "Disbursement is subject to the submission of certified true copy of Bill of Lading (with the Borrower as consignee)," while the accused signed on this second supplement letter on page 2 to confirm that Intraluck would “… hereby agree, accept and undertake to abide by all the aforesaid terms and conditions," in court, the accused claimed that he only looked at the total amount and not the contents of the document “…because there was just too much information on it.” Further, despite being an experienced businessman, he claimed that he would sign the documents even though he “don’t really understand”[^78]

197    However, quite aside from the inexplicable and incredible position that the accused took in disregarding the terms and conditions imposed by the banks in letters issued to him as MD of Intraluck, which letters he acknowledged and signed, his excuse that he treated the terms as mere guidelines that he could choose to ignore, rang hollow when he did not provide any basis, or any supporting evidence or a single witness to substantiate or justify such a position. Indeed, all the evidence produced in court – both oral and documentary – pointed to exactly the opposite conclusion.

198    These included the obvious and explicit provisions set out in the facility letters including the use of the words “terms and conditions”,[^79] and the evidence of the witnesses from all the banks, all of which clearly pointed to these provisions being requirements that the accused had agreed to, and which he obviously needed to abide by.

199    Indeed, if the facility letters were so inconsequential and were “merely administrative”, it would appear that he would have simply left them to be dealt with by his employees, or by Mdm Neo, who largely oversaw administrative matters for Intraluck. Thus, the accused’s words in court, and the actions that he took _vis a vis_ the banks, were clearly at odds with one another.

##### (3)    Requirement in the application forms and accused’s signature on the BLs

200    When it was pointed out to the accused that in the case of post-shipment delivery, there was evidence from representatives of seven different banks (including UOB which was not a victim) that for invoice financing loans, the application has to be accompanied by a transport document, the accused simply replied: “I don't care what they say. What I actually follow will be the invoice financing terms and conditions.”[^80]

201    However, even if what the accused really believed in what he had said in court, it should be noted that the requirement to provide a transport document, was not ONLY clearly set out in the facility letters that the accused signed with the banks, more critically, this same requirement appears in the invoice financing terms and conditions in the application forms that the accused signed and submitted in the case of at least four of the banks. Further, the accused had also signed on the BLs submitted to the banks as part of the Applications.

> (a)     Thus, in the case of DBS, in the invoice financing application form (P13), it was specifically stated that the bank required a BL, airway bill or delivery order. When confronted with this fact, the accused came up with a different story and claimed that the details in the application form were filled in by his staff and his job was just “to check whether the invoice number is correct, who I'm paying the money to and the amount stated. I did not pay attention to these little details.” He also insisted that the bank did not require him to provide the BL “(b)ecause for invoice financing, it's a new product, a new concept. The bank already knew that we do not have this copy of the bill of lading. So for this new product, the bill of lading is not a requirement.”[^81]

> (b)     As for P10, the application form made to ANZ bank, the accused admitted that according to this document, it was stated that for post-shipment loans, the application has to be accompanied by at least two documents, including a transport document. However, he insisted that “…right from the beginning it was not required.”[^82] He also stated that when signing the application form, he never saw the wordings which were crammed together and handled by his staff, and further asserted that when he was signing it, he did not see the BL and “(i)t was my staff who handled it.”[^83]

> (c)     When it was also pointed out to the accused that in the case of some of the other application letters (such as P2 for HSBC, and P5 for Citibank) which were all signed by the accused and which also specifically referred to the transport documents being attached to the applications, the accused insisted that he did not read this condition because the terms were too crammed. Yet, I note that while he claimed not to have read the requirement for the transport documents to be provided, the accused apparently did read and did know about the declarations on these same documents which required him to affirm that the transaction were genuine, and also that no other financing had been obtained from any other financial institution for the same goods. This despite the fact that both sets of requirements were written in the same language, and in essentially the same font size. Thus, the accused’s claim of ignorance (about the requirement to provide transport documents when making the application) made absolutely no sense.

> (d)     Clearly, the accused was simply coming up with more excuses when confronted with evidence that contradicted his earlier position. Needless to say, his claim of ignorance was completely unsupported by any evidence from the Defence, and was in fact contradicted by witnesses who testified, and the evidence that was produced by the Prosecution.

202    In short, it was abundantly clear that the accused knew that he had to provide the transport documents when making the applications for invoice financing. This would likely also explain why each of the Applications did in fact include the transport documents, in the form of BN080 or AN080 (which referred to BN080), attached to them as part of a complete set of invoice financing application documents faxed to the banks.

#### Accused submitted transport documents when making applications

203    It should be noted that all the invoice application forms made by Intraluck to the banks bore the accused’s signature. They were also received by the banks as a complete set i.e. consisting of the application form, the invoice and the transport document, being the BL in the case of five of the banks DBS (P13), Citibank (P5), OCBC (P6), ANZ (P10), and HSBC (P2)), and an AN in the case of KBC. These transport documents were precisely what the banks expected, and needed, for the application process.

204    While acknowledging that the above, the accused claimed that at the time when he signed the application forms, he did not see these documents attached to the form.[^84]Yet the accused’s claim was clearly debunked, when it was shown that the accused himself had signed on each of the BLs attached to the application forms. Specifically, the BLs that were attached as part of the application documents had the “Certified true copy" stamp affixed, AND the accused had signed on the stamp for each BL, to confirm that the BL attached was the true copy (see BL included as part of P2 (application to HSBC) below).

![]([2020] SGDC 0292_Image/[2020] SGDC 0292_image1.png)

205    When confronted with this damning fact, the accused essentially insisted that he had signed whatever the staff passed to him to sign, that he had no knowledge what the BLs were used for. He further insisted that he had signed on the BLs at a different time from the signing of the application forms.

206    Yet his supposed ignorance about the BL, and his alleged practice of blindly signing whatever his staff prepared and placed in front of him, were really quite incredible claims. This was especially so since he admitted that the BLs that were attached to P2, P6, P10 and P13, which he himself had signed as certified true copies, were not identical copies of one another. The latter fact showed that he had in fact signed these documents on multiple/separate times.[^85]

207     Further, it was really ridiculous to expect that the accused would be so gullible as to have ‘blindly’ certified as true, separate copies of the same BL when these same documents were placed before him at multiple/separate times. Moreover, his claim that these BLs were not given to him to sign at the same time that he signed the various application forms, was also hard to believe, since this meant that the staff had to first get him to sign his many application forms on one or more occasions, and then go through the trouble to get him to sign at three or four copies of the same BL on yet one or more separate occasion(s).

208    Further, it should be noted that the accused, when questioned, also insisted that BLs were not needed for Intraluck to receive goods. If this was the case, there was really no reason for the accused to certify the BLs as true copies, OTHER than for the purpose of using them as supporting documents when making invoice financing applications. In this regard:

> (a)     Even as the accused claimed to be familiar with the purpose and use of BLs, the accused was not able to answer why he was asked to sign on the BLs to certify them as true copies, if it was true that Intraluck did not need to use BLs at all. He also claimed not to have asked his staff why they needed him to certify the BLs as true copies. Further, the accused said that after he had signed and certified the BLs in this manner, he did not know what happened to them.

> (b)     His alleged ignorance was, however, even more unbelievable when he admitted that this practice of having BLs placed in front of him for certification as true copies “…had been going on for a long time, maybe a few years”, before later clarifying that it had been going on for “many years”[^86]. Despite this, he maintained that he does not know which departments needed the BL or for what purpose. In fact, the accused claimed that he did not even know why the BL that he was asked to certify as true copies, were even with Intraluck at all.[^87]

> (c)     It was also only belatedly, and after repeated questioning, that the accused claimed that it should be the case that a government department needs the BL to be certified as true copies by him. Yet even then, he provided no details as to which department needed the copies of the BL, or why these copies were needed by the Government at all.

209    All in all, the accused’s vacillation and unbelievable accounts suggested that he was making up evidence regarding the BLs as he went along. This, in turn, was likely prompted by his desire to deny the obvious i.e. that he had certified copies of the BL for use in the invoice financing application, as he himself had admitted in his statements.

210    Further, if the accused’s story was to be believed i.e. that his certification of the BLs was quite independent of any need for them to be used for the invoice financing application, his evidence would suggest that as early as September 2015, members of his staff had deliberately set about to deceive him, by placing the various application forms, and the various copies of the same BL080 for him to sign, and that they had done so on different occasions. As part of the deceit, they had then used these signed copies of the BLs for the invoice financing application, without the accused’s knowledge or approval.

211    Yet, there was simply no basis to suggest that any of them would have engaged in such blatant dishonesty, especially as there was no evidence that at that time, any of them had any dissatisfaction or complaint against the accused, or was in any way unhappy with their work at Intraluck. Certainly, there was no evidence that any disgruntled staff member had tendered his resignation at that stage. Even the accused himself acknowledged that there was no reason to believe that his staff had any reason to be unhappy with him. In the accused’s own words: “…. when my staff asked me to sign the bill of lading, they will not bring any harm to me. My staff will not bring harm to me.”[^88]

212    All in all, contrary to the claims of ignorance that the accused made in court, and also in his cautioned statements (D7-D12), the only plausible explanation was that the accused had knowingly and deliberately certified the copies of the same BL080 as part of the invoice financing application, and had submitted them directly or through his staff when he made the Applications.

213    His provision of the BL in this manner was precisely what was required of him, as set out in terms and conditions of the facility letters, and in the invoice financing application letters of the various banks.

#### Admissions contained in accused’s statements

214    The Prosecution tendered into evidence the four statements recorded from the accused pursuant to section 22 of the CPC. These were P19 (recorded on 29 August 2016), P20 (recorded on 31 August 2016) P21 (recorded on 7 October 2016) and P22 (recorded on 18 October 2016). All these statements were given by the accused in Mandarin, and recorded by ASP Yue in English. Amendments were made by the accused in P19, P20, and P21 when he crossed out a mistake in his nationality and signed against this correction. It was not disputed that all four statements were voluntarily made.

##### (1)    The accused gave a detailed account of the offences

215    In P19 and P20, the accused explained that Intraluck engaged in transhipment activities, whereby it acted as a middleman to arrange the financing of the sale of goods from an overseas seller to an overseas buyer which was located in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. This allowed the buyers to overcome difficulties in getting finance in their own names or in their own countries. Based on this arrangement, the financing for the transactions between such buyers and sellers, would actually be provided by a bank through an application made by Intraluck using the invoice financing facilities granted to it by Singapore banks. These sellers also do not export any actual goods to Singapore or to Intraluck, but the goods are transferred directly from the overseas seller to the overseas buyer.[^89]

216    The accused had explained the process as follows:

> (a)     The seller would check with the accused if Intraluck was able to finance a sale of goods between it and a potential buyer. If the accused agreed to provide the transhipment service, the seller then provides the accused with an invoice issued to Intraluck, even though the true sale of the goods was to the buyer and not to Intraluck.[^90]

> (b)     The accused then decides which bank to make the application for financing to “…. based on the amount stated in the transaction. If the amount is higher, I will then indicate on the invoice for the application to be given to DBS or Maybank as these are the banks which I have a closer relationship with. I will then give the invoice to my staff and have them prepare the respective bank application form based on the details stated in the invoice.”[^91]

> (c)     The accused was aware that of the documents required for the invoice financing application made to the banks. Specifically, he knew that each bank “…. mainly require a signed application form, invoice from supplier and shipping document such as Bill of Lading ("BL”).” [^92]

> (d)     As such, the accused picked and used a BL from one of Intraluck’s genuine import transactions with the date closest to the date of the invoice. He did this “(b)ecause the bank will only grant a loan if they see a BL but in this case, no goods were actually delivered to Singapore. So I just send a BL from another deal as part of the application to get the approval.”[^93]

> (e)     Thereafter, the accused explained how the application documents, with his signature (and that of Mdm Neo if necessary), would be submitted to the banks:[^94]

>> Once my accounts staff has completed the respective application forms of the banks, they will then bring the form to me to sign and chop with the company stamp of Intraluck. And then if Madam Neo's signature is also required I will personally hand the application to her for her to sign. The application will then be either post out, faxed to the banks or delivered by hand. The application will then be submitted to the bank

> (f)     The accused **made the application to the banks with a BL that he selected**, even though he admitted that he should not have submitted the same BL for more than one application to the banks. The specific question asked and answered by the accused setting this out, is reproduced below:[^95]

>> \[Question 17\] Are you aware that you should not have submitted the same BL for more than one bank application?

>> \[Answer\] Yes, I am aware. But why I did so was because initially when invoice financing started with the banks, BL was not a documentary requirement. But later, the banks changed their policy to require a shipping document as part of the required documents to be submitted in each application. For my transhipment business, the overseas sellers do not provide me a BL for their transactions. **_Thus, when I need to carry out my middleman role to obtain financing in such instances, I_** **_will take a single BL and submit to as many banks as needed to obtain the financing_****_. I had to do this in order to carry on doing the transhipment business._**

\[emphasis added\]

> (g)     Upon receipt and the approval of the application submitted by the accused, the bank will transfer the money to the overseas seller.[^96] Thereafter, Intraluck would issue an invoice to the buyer, requiring the buyer to pay Intraluck the amount that Intraluck was to pay to the bank, plus Intraluck’s own commission of 1% - 1.5% on the sale price.[^97]

> (h)     The accused said that he carried out the transhipment business initially to help his friends like Mr Chen (from Nummary) and Mr Zhang (from Lidong) who were the sellers. The accused added that:

>> …subsequently as I continued doing this transhipment service, I could earn commission from doing this business. **It is also a lucrative business****_, the profit from doing this transhipment business can be as high as 60-70 percent of my company's annual profit._** **Far more than the profit that my import business can generate****.**[^98]

\[emphasis added\]

217    The accused also explained that he was the only one who was aware of the “transhipment business”, and that neither the staff nor Mdm Neo knew about it. This even though he would get his staff to prepare and submit the documents, and also get Mdm Neo to endorse and sign on documents where necessary. The accused further explained in P19 and P20 as follows:

>     I am the only one in the know as **_this is a rather sensitive business. The other staff in the company only does what I tell them such as processing or submitting the application_** but they do not know about this transhipment business.”

(P19 at \[28\])

>     Again, I reiterate that I am the one who get the invoices from the Chinese businessmen during their regular travels there and then pass them to my staff to put up the invoice financing forms. **The BLs, I choose myself**. When I agree with my partners on how much they should pay me for each invoice, I will give the details to my staff to put up the Intraluck sates invoice. **_I do not tell them much about this 'transhipment' scheme_** as I am the only person brokering the deals in China and Hong Kong.

(P20 at \[39\])

\[emphasis added\]

218    Specifically, in respect of the allegations involving the Applications, the accused admitted that he had used the same BL (BL080) that he had previously used for the UOB application to make applications to other banks (see P21 at \[42\]-\[43\], \[47\] and P22 at \[127\]). This was not surprising, since the transaction in BL080 for the UOB application was close in time and involved similar quantities of goods as the transactions in the Applications. His action was, in fact, consistent with what he described as his modus operandi in P20.[^99]

219    It was thus clear that from these statements, the accused was the one who chose and included the transport documents in the Applications made to the banks, and that he had submitted or directed that they be submitted to the banks as part of the application process.

220    His motivations for doing so, his awareness that the transactions reflected in them were not genuine, as well as the general ‘secrecy’ and his personal involvement in the entire process were all clearly reflected in the statements. What was also clear was that while the statements were recorded over four sittings twice in August, and twice in October 2016, the general tenor of what the accused did, as well as his specific involvement in the choice, inclusion and submission of the transport documents, were consistently maintained by him in his voluntary statements.

##### (2)    Accuracy of statements ensured by measures taken

221    While not disputing the voluntariness of any of the four statements, the Defence challenged the accuracy of the s 22 statements and urged the Court not to rely on them. Essentially, the allegations of the Defence centred on claims that the recorder, ASP Yue, had inserted portions in the statements that were not said by the accused, or excluded things that the accused had said, ormis-recorded the questions and/or the accused’s answers, and also apparently had a pre-conceived notion that there was a scheme to cheat the banks.

222    It was further alleged that the accused was not administered a warning, before the recording of the statements (including the warning under s 23 of the CPC), nor was he told about why he was taken to CAD for questioning, or about the particulars of the offences, and about how the accused was supposedly acquainted with the offence(s). Amongst other things, the Defence also took issue with the alleged failure by the recorder to show the accused the BLs in the six charges, or to ask him for an explanation why copies of the same BL were furnished to the banks in the Applications. Other allegations made against the recorder and the recording process included claims that the statement was not read over to the accused before he signed it, the time it took to record them, and about the accused’s allegedly feeling unwell when the statement(s) was recorded. Further, in respect of the 17th charge (involving KBC), counsel highlighted that it was an AN, and not a BN that was faxed over, which made this charge bad in law. Nevertheless, while disputing the accuracy of the accused’s statement, the Defence took the position that at least as regards the answer to Question 10 in P19, this was consistent with his cautioned statement which the Defence claimed to be corroborative of his innocence. In short, the Defence urged the court not to place any weight on the s 22 statements and asked that they should be disregarded. [^100]

223    The Prosecution, unsurprisingly, submitted otherwise, arguing that there was no basis for the Defence to challenge the accuracy of the accused’s s 22 statements. Instead the Prosecution submitted that “(T)he allegations of fabrication, which go towards IO Yue’s professional integrity, are wholly unfounded. There is no basis whatsoever to suggest that IO Yue had fabricated parts and even whole paragraphs of the accused’s statements. There is no basis whatsoever to suggest that IO Yue had been influenced by a “_preconceived notion_”. Indeed, when questioned under cross-examination, the accused sought to distance himself from the position.”[^101]

224    The Prosecution also argued that there was no basis to doubt the accuracy of the s 22 statements recorded from the accused, pointing to a host of precautions taken by ASP Yue in the recording of the statement. These included the fact that before the recording of each statement, the accused was informed of the offence under investigation, and that he was warned to tell the police everything he knew about the offence. The accused even appended his signature next to the warning found on the first page of each statement.

225    On each occasion, the accused was also asked if he was well enough to provide his statement. There was also no difficulty in communications between the recorder and the accused, and where ASP Yue referred to documents in his questions, these were shown to the accused who went through them. After the statement recording was completed, ASP Yue read through the statement and explained it to the accused in Mandarin, and also gave the accused the opportunity to read the statement by himself. ASP Yue also asked the accused to sign on each page of the statement, which he did. In addition, the accused signed against the declaration on the last page of the statement, confirming that he had given the statement voluntarily, that the statement had been read over to him, that he had been offered the opportunity to make amendments, and that the accused had confirmed the statement to be true and correct.

226    Having carefully scrutinised the submissions from both parties, it was clear that the accounts of the statement recording process, as given by the accused and ASP Yue, were as different as night and day, and much depended on whose version of affairs I accepted. Having assessed the evidence, I considered that the allegations of fabrication and impropriety made against ASP Yue by the accused really made no sense, and I rejected them. Instead, I accepted that the statements accurately recorded what the accused had said to ASP Yue, in the course of the two months, interspersed with periods when the accused was on bail. My reasons are as follows:

> (a)     First, there was simply no reason for a professional officer to allegedly go out of his way to literally put his own words into the accused’s mouth (i.e. his statements) on the one hand, and at the same time, remove the accused’s words on the other, and to do this at various parts of the statements, as and when he (ASP Yue) decided. Indeed, there was no obvious motive for ASP Yue to do so, and certainly none was suggested by the accused.

> (b)     Further, it made no sense for ASP Yue to do it not only for one statement i.e. P19, but to continue to do so for all the other statements recorded over the course of the next two months, when the accused was already on bail after the recording of the first s 22 statement, and presumably could have complained against ASP Yue for his actions.

> (c)     I also did not believe the accused when he claimed that ASP Yue did not inform him that he was investigating into a cheating offence when he was recording the statement from him. There was certainly no reason for ASP Yue to have neglected to do so, since this would have made the accused aware of what ASP Yue was interested in, and thus facilitate ASP Yue in gathering the relevant information from him.

> (d)     Further, if ASP Yue had wanted to fabricate evidence against the accused in this manner, just so as to create a narrative that was damning to the accused, why was there a need for him to repeatedly call the accused back to provide more details – when ASP Yue – was going to just be “inventing” inaccurate and incriminating answers anyway. ASP Yue could easily have done so in one, or at most two statements, especially when, as alleged by the Defence, he already had a “_preconceived notion_” of the accused’s guilt.

> (e)     In addition, the accused’s claim made against ASP Yue essentially meant that the latter was going out of his way to get the accused in trouble, and doing so not only without any obvious benefit, but certainly at clear risk to himself. This was because what the Defence was alleging was that ASP Yue was essentially committing a criminal offence of fabricating evidence against the accused, and doing so not just once, but repeatedly over the course of recording the four statements over the two months. The accused also suggested that ASP Yue had even misled him into believing that the statement recording process would be video and audio recorded, when this was not the case. Yet, the allegation of such elaborate and repeated deception and fabrication by ASP Yue, were again unsubstantiated and again made no sense. I thus rejected the wild and unfounded allegations of impropriety made against ASP Yue.

227    In addition, quite aside from a lack of reason or motivation for ASP Yue to have fabricated evidence against the accused, the objective facts also suggested that there was nothing improper in the recording of the statements, and that the appropriate precautions had been put in place, and the necessary requirements had been adopted to ensure the accurate recording of the accused’s statements. In this regard:

> (a)     At the first page of each of the accused’s statement was information to him that an investigation was being conducted into an offence of cheating and a warning to the accused for him to tell the police about what he knew. In the case of P19-P21, this warning was on the same page that the accused had spotted the error as to his nationality, showing that he was paying attention to what was written there.

> (b)     Further, while the accused denied that this warning was read to him, the accused’s denial was further contradicted by his own signature that appeared right below the warning and the information about the possible offence. I would add that the specific questions that were then asked of the accused about his role in the invoice financing matter, and the answers that followed from him, also appear to be fully consistent with the warning and information about what was being investigated, as stated at the beginning of the statement.

> (c)     The process of statement taking was carried out in Mandarin, and the statement was recorded in English. ASP Yue’s testimony was that both he and the accused had no problems understanding each other, and I saw no reason to disbelieve this aspect of ASP Yue’s evidence. Indeed, if there had been any difficulty in communications between them, this would have been apparent from the recording of the first statement P19. If so, one would have expected the accused to have requested for a change to be made to the recorder, or he would have insisted on the presence of an interpreter for the subsequent statement recording. However, no request of either kind was made by the accused, nor was there any unhappiness expressed by him at ASP Yue’s conduct as a statement recorder, or about his role in the process. In fact, by all accounts, the accused appears to have had a favourable view of ASP Yue, even after the accused had given both his s 22 statements and his cautioned statements to the latter.

> (d)     As regards the recording of P19, while the accused also alleged that he was unwell and had not taken his breakfast during the statement recording process, I note that the accused had also testified that he neither asked for food or water, even though ASP Yue had specifically asked him if he wanted either. The accused also said that ASP Yue had told the accused that if he felt uncomfortable, he could come back on another day for the statement taking. In addition, it was recorded in the statement that the accused himself had said that he was well enough to give his statement, after ASP Yue had specifically asked him this standard question at the beginning of the statement taking. Further, I note that it was never the Defence’s position that the accused could not give his answers, or that he was forced to go on despite not being in a fit condition to do so.

228    As for alleged inaccuracies in the statements, I note that the evidence of the accused seemed to be that parts of the statements – essentially the innocuous parts – were accurate and were what he had said – while, conveniently, it was the incriminating parts which set out clear and detailed accounts of his involvement and the rationale and method by which the offences were committed – that were allegedly inaccurate. In fact, the accused even claimed that some of the questions were not asked by ASP Yue, or were not asked in the manner that they appear in the statements. Further, he claimed that some of the answers that appear in the statements were not what he had said.

229    With respect, especially in the case of his first s 22 statement P19, I found it difficult to understand how he could so clearly remember what he was asked, and also to remember what he had allegedly said (which all happened to be innocuous accounts), or not said (which all happened to be incriminatory). This was especially so since the accused had also alleged that he was in a somewhat distressed and unwell state at that time, having taken some medicine, but no food, when P19 was recorded, and would thus would hardly be in a condition to remember so many intricate details..

230    In addition, aside from seeing no reason for ASP Yue to have fabricated evidence about the recording of the accused’s statements, I also saw no reason to believe that the detailed accounts contained in those statements did not emanate from the accused himself. Instead, I accepted ASP Yue’s evidence that that P19-P22 were accurate accounts of what the accused had told ASP Yue about the workings of Intraluck, and how it carried out its business and invoice financing activities.

> (a)     In this regard, and again referring to the precautions adopted by ASP Yue in the recording process, I note that each page of the statements was signed by the accused and the recorder, and each amendment made to the statements was pointed out and counter-signed by the accused. Further, at the end of each statement, there was a confirmation by the accused that there was no inducement, threat or promise made to him, that the statement was made in Mandarin, that he had been given the opportunity to amend (and in fact did amend his statements in the case of P19-P21), and also that the statement was true and correct. Finally, following each attestation, the accused and the recorder had also signed.

> (b)     I would add that the accused – an astute and experienced businessman – could hardly have failed to appreciate the significance of appending his signature to the warning and amendment at the beginning of the statement, to the bottom of each page of each statement, and to the attestation just mentioned.

> (c)     It was also the evidence of ASP Yue that he had read and explained the statements to accused in Mandarin, and had also given the statement to the accused to read. I have no doubt that this was done. In fact, as could be seen from the fact that the accused has had dealings with numerous documents written in English before, including the many forms, letters and agreements presented in the course of the trial, which he never claimed to have been unable to read, these measures taken by ASP Yue, especially the provision of the statements to the accused himself to read, showed that ASP Yue was confident that what he had recorded from the accused was accurate, and also provided further assurance that what the accused finally signed and approved as his statements were what he actually said to the recorder.

> (d)     In fact, using just one example of an alleged “error” in the recording of his statement by ASP Yue, the accused had claimed that ASP Yue had typed in references to TR at various points in his statement P19, which were inaccurate because his dealings with the banks were through invoice financing, and that he does not have TR arrangements with any bank. Further, the accused had claimed in court that a TR was never executed for invoice financing, and claimed that the IO had confused the concept of TR with invoice financing.[^102] However, as rightly pointed out to the accused by the DPP, the accused himself had made mention of the TR and equated it with invoice financing when he handwrote his cautioned statement in D7, a document that he, in fact, put forward to assert his innocence.

> (e)     While, the accused then tried to claim that he only wrote TR in D7 so that the IO could understand, the fact remained that this showed that it was the accused himself who would make reference to TRs in his statements, and that the concept of TRs was not something that ASP Yue had come up with himself. This also suggested that the mention of TR in the accused’s earlier s 22 statements, was initiated by the accused, and was not something added by ASP Yue on his own volition. Clearly, this example corroborated ASP Yue’s evidence that the contents of the s 22 statements (P19-P22) came from the accused himself, and were not the words of ASP Yue.

> (f)     In summary, I was satisfied that the s 22 statements, P19-P22, which were presented as that of the accused, accurately set out what the accused had said to ASP Yue. These included the admissions that the accused had made that he was responsible for choosing the various transport documents, and of including and presenting them to the banks to obtain financing, allegedly on the basis that the goods had been transported to Singapore. He did this even though he was aware that this was not the case. Instead, the accused knew that the goods had been transferred from one overseas seller to one overseas buyer, and Intraluck was just acting as a middleman in the transaction.

231    Finally, and for completeness, the Defence had argued that ASP Yue should have administered the caution under s 23 of the CPC when he was recording the s 22 statement P19 on 29 August 2016, and that his failure to do so rendered his subsequent statements inadmissible. Hence, the Defence argued, no weight should be placed on any of the them[^103]. With respect, I agreed with the Prosecution that this argument of the Defence was “a non-starter”.

> (a)     First, a caution under s 23 of the CPC is only required when a statement was recorded from **_an accused_** under this section. Specifically, it is at that stage, when the enforcement agency has investigated and decided that there is enough evidence that a specific person will be charged or may be prosecuted for the offence, then that individual is labelled as an accused.

> (b)     It is also at that stage that a charge is drafted and presented to the accused, and the caution is then administered to him to specifically invite him to state any matter relating to the charge before him. This process can be seen from the text of s 23(1) CPC itself:

>> 23.—(1) If, during an investigation, **_a person (referred to in this section as_** **_the accused_**) is charged with an offence or informed by a police officer or any other person charged with the duty of investigating offences or charging offenders that he may be prosecuted for an offence, he must be served with and have read to him a notice in writing as follows:

>> “You have been charged with \[or informed that you may be prosecuted for\] —

**(** **_set out_** **the charge**).

>> **_Do you want to say anything_** **_about the charge_** **_that was just read to you_**? If you keep quiet now about any fact or matter in your defence and you reveal this fact or matter in your defence only at your trial, the judge may be less likely to believe you. This may have a bad effect on your case in court. Therefore it may be better for you to mention such fact or matter now. If you wish to do so, what you say will be written down, read back to you for any mistakes to be corrected and then signed by you.”.

\[emphasis added\]

> (c)     Thus, this caution is **ONLY administered** at the stage when the precise charge is put before the accused so that he can respond to that specific charge that was “just read to \[him\]”. It is only after the above have been done, that his (cautioned) statement is recorded from him.

> (d)     This was precisely the process that took place in the present case, when the cautioned statements, D7-D12, were recorded on 16 November 2017 following investigations by the CAD, and it was at that stage that the accused “attained” the status of an accused person. It was on this occasion that the precise charges were read, and the cautioned administered, in accordance with s 23 of the CPC.

232    As for the earlier statements P19-P22, they were all recorded much earlier from 29 August 2016 to 18 October 2016, pursuant to s 22 of the CPC, when the investigations had not been completed, and the accused was still only a witness (and not yet accused of an offence). Further, at that much earlier stage, no charge(s) had been drawn up against him. Consequently, the conditions necessary to administer a caution under s 23 of the CPC did not exist. It was thus hardly surprising that no caution under s 23 of the CPC was administered to the accused by ASP Yue before P19-P22 were recorded. In other words, ASP Yue had conducted himself perfectly in accordance with the CPC when he did not administer such a caution to the accused, and there was no basis for the Defence to raise any objection as a result.

##### (3)    Corroboration of admissions in accused’s statements

233    The Prosecution further highlighted that there was evidence that corroborated the admissions that the accused had made in his s 22 statements. Broadly, this included the accused’s own testimony concerning Intraluck’s business, and about how the accused operated the company.

234    In this regard, the accused had admitted in court that Intraluck carried out the transhipment/middleman financing business, and this was broadly in line with what was found in his s 22 statements. Further, his evidence in court about the functions that he carried out as well as the pivotal role he played in Intraluck, being the managing director and main shareholder, and also about him being the critical decision maker in Intraluck in respect of dealings with the clients (on business matters), and with the banks (on financing matters) also mirrored what he had told ASP Yue as recorded in his statements.

235    In addition, the accused’s portrayal of Mdm Neo, as being essentially an ex-employee made good, and someone who largely played an administrative and minor role in the company as compared to him, notwithstanding her status as a co-director, was also consistent with what he had set out in his statements. So was his account about the staff playing largely background and support roles and essentially just carrying out his directions.

236    Further, as highlighted by the Prosecution, the secrecy with which the accused carried out the transhipment business, something which he admitted to in his statements, was consistent with the evidence in court from bank representatives such as those from KBC and DBS that they were not aware of Intraluck’s transhipment business. Further, the accused’s confirmation in his statement that he did not inform Mdm Neo about the transhipment business, was also consistent with Mdm Neo’s own evidence where she described the accused as being in charge of the whole company and as “…the boss of the company”, and herself as “an employee”, who would essentially sign on invoice application forms when required to, and only after she had seen that the accused has already signed, with the company stamp, approving the supplier's invoice.

237    In addition, the fact that the accused had signed and certified as true the copies of the BLs that were attached to the applications made to HSBC, Citibank, OCBC, ANZ and DBS, corroborated the account in his statement that he had deliberately selected the BLs to be used for the applications as part of the transhipment business.

238    In short, the crucial aspects of the accused’s earlier s 22 statements were corroborated by other evidence produced in court, much of which came from the accused himself. Such corroboration lent strong support to the accuracy of the statements, and to the Prosecution’s argument that the sole source of the information and admissions in the s 22 statements was the accused himself.

### Second Issue: Dishonest intention to induce banks to deliver property

239    As indicated above, in his s 22 statements, the accused had explained that he made the applications to the banks for invoice financing, and provided the transport documents to them as part of the applications. This was in line with the transhipment activities that he, as managing director of Intraluck, engaged in, at the request of the overseas seller, in order to obtain financing from Singapore banks. For these applications, the accused essentially represented, through the provision of the transport documents (BL/AN) that the goods reflected in the invoices had been transported to Singapore when this was not the case.

240    Specifically, as regards the Applications, it was clear that the representations made by the accused to the banks were false as the goods set out in BL080 (and AN080) that he provided to the banks, which he essentially represented as corresponding to the goods in the various invoices tendered to them as part of the Applications, were in fact the same goods referred to in the BL (BL080) referred to in the earlier UOB Application. However, since it was undisputed that the UOB application was legitimate, the goods stated in BL080 could not have been the same goods referred to in the other invoices that were submitted to the banks for the later Applications.

241    Yet, this was exactly what the accused purported to represent by the submission of the same BL080 (or AN080 that referred to BL080) to the banks when he applied for invoice financing from them.

242    In fact, being aware that the banks would only grant a loan if they saw a transport document, but being unable to produce a genuine transport document because no goods were actually delivered to Singapore for the invoices that were part of the Applications, the accused used BL080, which he had referred to in the UOB application only days earlier, to submit to the banks to obtain financing from them. For KBC, he used AN080 that made reference to BL080 for the invoice financing application.

243    As noted above, this process was exactly what the accused described that he did, when he gave the detailed accounts of his activities in his s 22 statements. Pursuant to this deceit, the respective banks paid the seller, and Intraluck subsequently invoiced the buyer requiring the buyer to pay Intraluck the amount that Intraluck was to pay to the bank, plus Intraluck’s own commission of 1%- 1.5% on the sale price (see \[216\] above).

244    Clearly what the accused did was dishonest, and he was well aware of this, as he admitted knowing that he should not have submitted the same BL for more than one bank application. Yet he admitted that he did this anyway in order to carry on the transhipment business which was highly profitable for Intraluck. Further, in light of the clearly illegal nature of what he did, the accused admitted that he did not let Mdm Neo or his staff know about this “sensitive” business.

245    As a result of playing the middleman role, which required him to deceive the banks, the accused intentionally made wrongful gains. In his words: “(i)t is also a lucrative business, the profit from doing this transhipment business can be as high as 60-70 percent of my company's annual profit. Far more than the profit that my import business can generate.”[^104]

246    In short, it was greed that made the accused ignore the obviously illegal nature of what he was doing, and to carry on nonetheless.

### Third Issue: Banks relied on transport documents and were deceived

247    The representatives from the bank explained that for post shipment invoice financing, which was what the accused applied for, a transport document (such as a BL), evidencing proof of shipment was needed. As stated above, this was a requirement clearly set out in their facility letters, and also explicitly stated in some of the application forms, all of which were documents that the accused signed. Where the transport documents were not provided, the banks would not provide the financing, or would require special approval before financing would be provided.

248    In the present case, transport documents (in the form of BN080 and AN080) was provided by Intraluck to the banks as part of the Applications, and hence financing was approved by them. As highlighted by the Prosecution,[^105] for the six charges, records from three of the banks (Citibank, KBC and DBS) also showed that BN080 and AN080 was in fact specifically considered and relied on as part of the approval process for the invoice financing applied for.

249    In any event, the evidence from the documentation adduced in the form of facility letters, application forms and internal documents, as well as evidence from the representatives of all the banks, showed that as per their standard operating procedures, the provision of transport documents by the customer, was a crucial part of each bank’s approval process. Invariably, for each bank, transport documents from the applicant would be required before the invoice financing application would be processed and approved, and funds disbursed.

250    I would add that while the Defence took the position that it was incumbent on the Prosecution to produce the exact staff member from each of the banks, who had allegedly relied on the provision of the transport documents to approve the disbursement of funds, I did not agree with this submission. Clearly, this was not a crucial requirement or an ingredient of the charges as drafted, since the victim named in each charge, was not the individual staff member, but a corporate entity i.e. the bank itself. And for each of the banks, it was clear from the evidence of their bank representatives that they all operated through their individual employees each performing specific roles in the loan checking and approval process, leading up to the final disbursement of funds.

251    In other words, as the banks are all corporate entities rather than human persons, it was clear from the testimonies of their various bank representatives, and the documents tendered in the course of the trial (including the facility letters, application forms, and internal bank documents), that the decision making and operations of these banks were carried out through the collective efforts of the various human employees, all of which were effected through specific steps set out in their various standard operational procedures (“SOPs”). What was also abundantly clear from the evidence adduced of the SOPs and processes of each of the banks, was that the transport document had to be submitted as part of the invoice application and approval process.

252    Thereafter, again as part of the processing of the application by the individual bank, the transport document would be looked out for, confirmed to be present, and relied on by the various employees of the bank, before approval of the invoice financing application made by the accused would be given. Following the processing done in this manner, in respect of all the charges, funds were then disbursed pursuant to the Applications made by the accused.

253    Indeed, as summarised by the Prosecution,[^106] the evidence showed that:

> (a)     The submission of a transport document was an essential requirement for applications for invoice financing;

> (b)     The banks would have checked for this document as part of their internal processes;

> (c)     A transport document was in fact provided for each of the Applications; and

> (d)     The banks approved the Applications and disbursed the funds.

254    I would add that it was also an undisputed fact that the banks, pursuant to the Applications, approved the invoice financing loans applied for, and disbursed the monies directly to the suppliers (see ASOF at \[6\]).

255    In any event, I note that the accused had also admitted in his statements that he knew that transport documents were required by the banks, if he was to successfully get them to provide the funds that he was seeking. That was why he worked so hard to get hold of a suitable BL from one of Intraluck’s genuine import transactions, with the date closest to the date of the invoice to provide to the bank as part of the invoice financing application process. He subsequently selected and provided BL080 (and AN080) to the banks, even though the underlying transactions in the Applications were not genuine, as the goods reflected in the invoices which he had provided as part of the Applications, were not shipped to Singapore as part of the underlying transactions.

256    I would also add that while the accused did try, in the course of his testimony, to argue that the banks did not rely on the transport documents, his bare claim was devoid of substance, and unsubstantiated by any evidence, least of all evidence from bank representatives, or from any other bank customer who had previously applied for and obtained similar post-shipment financing.

257    Further, the basis of the accused’s unsubstantiated assertion was also not shown to be correct, nor did his claim even make sense, bearing in mind the logic and evidence of the representatives of the banks who had explained the need and rationale for these transport documents to be provided i.e. to show that shipment had indeed taken place in accordance with the application.

258    For completeness, I would add that while the banks may also have relied on other safeguards before approving the loans, such as the provision of a personal guarantee from the accused, having pre-approved lists of suppliers that they dealt with, and having the accused make several declarations contained in the application forms, this did not detract from the fact that the banks clearly did also rely on the transport documents submitted as part of Intraluck’s application, and were deceived by the misrepresentation as a result.

259    In this regard, I can do no better than to quote what Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) had stated in _Hwa Lai Heng Ricky v Public Prosecutor_, a case which also involved the cheating of DBS. At \[16\], his Honour said:

>     The fact that there were other matters which DBS had to consider in its final decision to permit the loan disbursement, such as the financial risk involved in lending, and completion of the relevant legal documentation, was inconsequential. In _Seaward v PP_ \[1994\] 3 SLR 369, **_I have held that to prove a cheating charge_**, **_the inducement need not be the sole or even main reason for the delivery of the property by the deceived party_****_. So long as the deceiving party’s deception played some part in inducing the victim to deliver some property, this element in the offence would be satisfied_**.

\[emphasis mine\]

260    All in all, it was abundantly clear that each of the banks did rely on the transport documents (BL080 and/or AN080) that were submitted to them as part of the individual application that was signed and approved by the accused, and each bank was thereby deceived into approving the loans and disbursing the funds. That the banks were ultimately repaid the amounts that they disbursed was really neither here nor there. The fact remained that deception of the banks had already occurred, and monies were earlier paid out based on the deception by the accused. In other words, the charges had already been made out by the time the banks were repaid their loans.

### Dealing with other matters raised

261    There were other matters raised by the Defence. While they may not have been directly relevant in considering whether the Prosecution had successfully established the elements of the proceeded charges, for the sake of completeness, I will briefly set out my views about them.

262    First, I observed that the FIR in this case was made by Ms Cheah in July 2016, wherein she had alleged that she had been asked to refax BLs by the accused. The DPPs clarified that it was not the Prosecution’s case that the BLs allegedly “refaxed” were necessarily the same BLs mentioned in the charges. In this regard, I note that:

> (a)     According to Ms Cheah, she was allegedly asked to refax the BLs, and not that she was asked to fax the BLs to the banks for the first time. Next, she was not asked to fax entire sets of application documents, each of which would presumably have included the application form, the invoice and the BL, but was apparently asked only to refax the BLs alone. In light of these observations, it appears more likely that those BLs that she was asked to refax, were not the same transport documents referred to in the present charges, since the latter were provided to the banks as part of a complete set of application documents.

> (b)     Thus, to that extent, Ms Cheah’s evidence, and also that of the other Intraluck witnesses like Ms Nah and Mdm Neo, were of limited value, since they apparently did not relate directly to the six proceeded charges. Whether they may (or may not) have been relevant to the allegations contained in the 500 plus other stood down charges that the accused faced was also not something I needed to consider. Nevertheless, while the allegations contained in the FIR do not necessarily relate directly to the present six charges, it was clear that the FIR nonetheless prompted the CAD’s investigations into Intraluck that ultimately led to the accused facing the present six charges.

263    While my observations above meant that the evidence of Ms Cheah, Ms Nah, and also Mdm Neo, may not have been critical in respect of the present six charges, I note that the Defence spent a considerable amount of time alleging that it was possibly Ms Cheah, Ms Nah and/or other members of the staff who had deliberately and unilaterally faxed the BLs to the banks without the knowledge or prompting of the accused, thus falsely implicating the accused. However, I considered this scenario to be highly improbable. In this regard, I note that:

> (a)     The application for invoice financing required the signature of the accused and the provision of transport documents to the banks. In the case of all the Applications, they were signed by the accused, and the same BL (BL090) or the related AN (AN080) were attached as supporting documents to the applications made by him.

> (b)     For the applications made to five of the banks (HSBC-P2, Citibank–P5, OCBC-P6, ANZ-P10, and DBS-P13), the BLs attached to these applications were all certified and signed by the accused as “CERTIFIED TRUE COPY”.

> (c)     In addition, every successful application made to the banks really served only to benefit Intraluck directly, and the accused, its main shareholder and director, indirectly. Hence, it was hardly likely that the employees would have unilaterally attached the transport documents in the applications to the banks, when there was really no reason or benefit for them to do so.

> (d)     Further in the case of Ms Cheah and Ms Nah, since both of them had apparently left Intraluck on good terms in October/November 2015, it was also hardly likely that either or both of them had been responsible for submitting the transport documents to the banks unilaterally, and/or without the knowledge or approval of the accused in September 2015, just so as to get Intraluck/the accused into trouble.

> (e)     Finally, as the accused played the main role in Intraluck when liaising with the banks for financing, and with the overseas buyers and sellers for business, it seems hardly plausible that the transport documents could be provided to the banks by persons other than him. This was particularly so, since the accused had admitted that the transhipment business was actually a confidential affair that he engaged in, without the knowledge of his staff, or even of Mdm Neo.

264    Separately, while there was also a suggestion from the Defence that the making of the FIR by Ms Cheah, as well as the evidence that Ms Cheah and Ms Nah gave about the accused in court, were prompted by them allegedly having an ulterior motive of \`sabotaging’ the business of Intraluck in favour of their new employers (EDA Aluminium), this claim was unsubstantiated. It also fails to explain why the allegations against Intraluck and the accused were made only in July 2016, when they joined EDA Aluminium many months earlier. Clearly, if they wanted to do Intraluck and the accused in, they would more likely have made the “false” allegations much earlier and closer to the time that they left Intraluck.

265    In any event, as stated earlier, much of the testimony of Ms Cheah and/or Ms Nah was not directly relevant to the current proceedings since, as discussed above, the evidence against the accused on the present charges consisted largely of the evidence of the various bank representatives, the various incriminating documents tendered (many of which carried the accused’s own signature), and the various admissions that the accused had made in his s 22 statements recorded over the course of two months.

266    I would also add that in the same vein, criticisms levelled by the Defence against ASP Yue for not referring to the FIR or to the allegations made by Ms Cheah, when he questioned the accused, were neither here nor there, again since they did not have a direct bearing on the present charges.

267    As for the argument raised by the Defence that use of AN080 for the application made to KBC rendered the 17th charge “_bad in law_”, I agreed with the Prosecution that this argument was misconceived. [^107] This was because AN080 made specific reference to BL080, and AN080 was attached as part of the set of application documents submitted to KBC (which the bank relied on to grant the loan). Thus, that KBC was deceived into granting the loan on the basis that a BL had been issued (as indicated by AN080 – see below) was sufficient to make out the elements of the charge as drafted.

![]([2020] SGDC 0292_Image/[2020] SGDC 0292_image2.png)

268    Finally, while the Defence also raised the fact that no BL or other incriminating evidence (except possibly for the stamp of Foshan Sanshui Yongya Aluminium Produce Co Ltd Stamp – P14) was found in Intraluck’s office when it was raided, I observed that the raid took place almost a year after the alleged offences. This being the case, the lack of such evidence being found at the office, was really neither here nor there.

## Conclusion

269    In conclusion, on the issue of guilt, having carefully assessed the evidence, I was of the view that the Prosecution has proven all the elements of the six charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and I convicted him accordingly.

## Sentencing Phase

270    Having found the accused guilty of the charges proceeded with, I now deal with the issue of sentencing.

### Prescribed punishment

271    In respect of an offence under s 420 of the PC, the prescribed punishment is a term of imprisonment of up to 10 years, and the offender shall also be liable to a fine.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

272    The DPP tendered written submissions on sentence. In essence, the Prosecution’s position on sentence was as follows:

> (a)     For a sentence of at least 14 months’ imprisonment for each of the five charges involving amounts of between USD 90,253.25 and USD 93,494.58, which were equivalent to about SGD 127,000 to SGD 131,000 (i.e. DAC-943115-2017 to DAC-943118-2017 and DAC- 943156-2017);

> (b)     For a sentence of at least 20 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving USD 162,673.44 which was equivalent to about SGD 229,000 (i.e. DAC-943114-2017); and

> (c)     For the sentence for DAC-943114-2017 and two of the remaining charges to run consecutively, for a global sentence of 48 months’ imprisonment, in respect of the total sum of USD 622,783.95 (approx. SGD 878,000) that was cheated.

273    I summarise the main points made by the Prosecution to justify its sentencing position.

274    First, the Prosecution argued that general deterrence is the primary sentencing consideration here, as the case involves offences which “…affect the delivery of financial services and/or the integrity of the economic infrastructure” (citing _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span> (“_Law Aik Meng_” at \[24(e)\]). In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that there was a blatant abuse of invoice financing facilities where the accused had targeted six financial institutions. If such offences were left unchecked, it would amount to a “slow drip of a subtle but potent poison” that will “inexorably and irremediably damage Singapore’s standing as a financial hub as well as a preferred centre of commerce.” _(_citing _PP v Fernando Payagala Waduge Malitha Kumar_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 334</span> (“_Fernando Payagala_”) at \[88\]). Further, a deterrent sentence was necessary to “rehabilitate Singapore’s reputation” that had been damaged by recent large scale bank frauds.[^108]

275    Next, the Prosecution highlighted the following aggravating factors:[^109]

> (a)     First, the amounts involved in the present case were substantial, coming up to USD 622,783.95 (approx. SGD 878,000). The banks were put at risk for these sums, even though they were ultimately repaid. In this regard, the banks had disbursed loans to overseas parties unknown to them, and whom they were not able to conduct due diligence against.

> (b)     Second, the offences were highly planned and pre-meditated. The accused had selected the shipping documents, chosen suitable banks to make applications to, and had concealed details from his staff.

> (c)     Third, the offences were committed for profit. The accused had admitted that the offences were lucrative and accounted for a large share (up to 60-70%) of Intraluck’s annual revenue.

> (d)     Fourth, the offences were difficult to detect. Banks often have to rely on information provided by applicants for credit, because of the difficulty in independently verifying the information. In this case, the offences committed in September 2015, only came to light after an Intraluck employee had filed a police report in July 2016, and then again only after investigations were carried out by the CAD.

> (e)     Fifth, the accused has shown no remorse. During the trial, he took patently unreasonable positions to try to distance himself from his fraud, and also levelled baseless allegations against the IO of fabricating parts and even whole paragraphs of his statements.

276    The Prosecution also argued that the sentence sought was in line with the decision in _Chew Soo Chun v PP and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 78</span> (“_Chew Soo Chun_”), which also involved an offender who had applied for invoice financing loans using fictitious invoices to deceive the bank into believing that the company had made certain sales when there were none. This caused the bank to disburse sums of SGD 173,414.24, SGD 160,815.48 and SGD 174,424.80 over three occasions (the subject of the s 420 PC charges). The offender was sentenced to 14 to 16 months’ imprisonment on each s 420 PC charge after pleading guilty to the proceeded charges.

277    The Prosecution argued that the accused here had similarly cheated the banks into disbursing funds under invoice financing loans, and that the sums involved here were comparable. Thus, the starting point for the sentence to be imposed for each individual charge should be 12 to 16 months’ imprisonment, based on the quantum in each charge. Further, while the offender in _Chew Soo Chun_ had pleaded guilty and demonstrated significant remorse, the accused here was convicted only after a long trial, and so he could not expect to benefit from a sentencing discount for pleading guilty. A further uplift from the proposed starting point was also warranted in light of the principle of general deterrence. Thus, taking the factors above in totality, it was submitted that the sentences for each individual charge ought to be between 14 to 20 months’ imprisonment, depending on the quantum in each charge.

278    As for the proposed global sentence of 48 months’ imprisonment, the Prosecution highlighted that in _Tan Thiam Wee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 4 SLR 141</span> (“_Tan Thiam Wee_”), the offender had submitted fictitious invoices to obtain loans totalling SGD 478,433.70 from OCBC Bank when his company faced cashflow problems. The offender was originally sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 60 months’ imprisonment, which was reduced to 30 months’ imprisonment on appeal because the High Court gave significant mitigating weight to the fact that the offender’s intentions in committing the fraud was to tide his company over its cashflow issues and “so that his company could survive and his employees could remain in their jobs”.[^110] Since such a mitigating factor was absent here, the Prosecution argued that the original sentence of 60 months imprisonment would be the reference point to compare against.

279    Further, while not expressly referred to in its sentencing submissions, the Prosecution also submitted a table of sentencing precedents consisting of five cases where the offenders were convicted of similar offences under s 420 of the PC, all of which cases involved cheating of banks to grant loans. Only three of these were reported decisions, and they are outlined below.

### Mitigation plea

280    In his mitigation plea, aside from repeating some arguments already canvassed during the trial to argue the accused’s innocence, counsel also submitted that:

> (a)     The accused’s company, Intraluck, had performed and fulfilled all the terms and conditions of the invoice financing applications, and that no bank had complained otherwise.

> (b)     All the monies disbursed by the banks in the financing of the invoices in the charges were secured by the personal guarantees of the accused, and all the outstanding payments related to the six charges had been fully repaid by Intraluck with the contractual interests on due dates, and the banks had not suffered any losses.

> (c)     The accused, who is 74 years of age, is a first offender with a long history of public service and charitable works, and is of good character.

281    In addition, counsel put up several medical reports to show that the accused had been diagnosed with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML) in March 2018. As stated in the medical report dated 29 Jan 2019, “(b)ased on detailed molecular tests done, he has a higher risk CMML, where the median survival period is less than 22 months from diagnosis. He will require close medical surveillance and treatment”. In a later medical report produced by counsel that was dated 11 Sept 2020, Dr Lim Zi Yi, had stated that: "He has a recent flare of his condition with falling platelet counts and as a result has commenced chemotherapy to stabilise his condition commencing 7 Sep 2020. He will require treatment for at least 5-6 months." In addition to CMML, the accused has been treated for diabetes since November 2009.

282    Based on his diagnosis, counsel argued that: “Having regard to all the facts peculiar to the offences in connection with the commission of the offences and peculiar to the accused, in particular to his present dire medical condition, the court is urged to consider the exercise judicial mercy when determining the sentences to be imposed on the accused.”

283    In line with the above, counsel urged the court to impose the minimum term of imprisonment of one day, and in lieu of a lengthy period of incarceration, a fine which would reflect the fact that all the banks had been repaid the loans in full with contractual interest on due dates which was more than 9 months before the CAD investigations began, and that none of the banks in question had suffered financial losses.

## Decision on sentence

### General sentencing considerations

284    As regards the sentence to impose, I start off by first considering the relevant sentencing principles and precedents put forward before me. As the issue of the offender’s ill health has also taken centre stage in the consideration of sentence, I will deal with this in greater detail at a later part of the judgment.

285    On the sentence sought by the Prosecution, I broadly agreed with the sentencing principles and factors put forward in its submissions. In this regard, there was no doubt that the accused’s actions in using essentially the same BL and/or related documents in the applications made to the banks – in clear and blatant disregard of the express prohibitions against such a practice - struck at the integrity of the system of invoice financing that banks provide to businesses that depend on such credit facilities. In this regard, and in line with the cases and examples cited by the Prosecution, which made clear the importance of safeguarding the integrity of our financial services and reputation, I agreed that offences of this nature must be strongly discouraged through the imposition of appropriate deterrent sentences.

286    Further, I agreed with the Prosecution that there were clear aggravating factors that pointed to a substantial sentence being deserved. These included:

> (1)     The large sums involved in the cheating charges totalling USD 622,783.95 in all (approx. SGD 878,000), for which risk the six banks had been exposed to as a result of the accused’s actions. Such a risk had been thrust upon them in a manner that they neither knew nor agreed;

> (2)     The extent of planning by the accused in successfully carrying out the offences. In this regard, in his statements, the accused had described how he had chosen his victims, how he had perpetuated the frauds, and also about the measures and precautions that he took in ensuring the secrecy and success of his offences;

> (3)     The clear profit motive on the part of the accused and the lucrative returns obtained from the commission of the offences;

> (4)     The difficulty in detecting such sophisticated and well-planned schemes. As highlighted by the Prosecution, it took a whistle blower, in the form of his former employee Ms Cheah, followed by extensive investigations by the CAD, through the recording of various statements from the accused, and investigations with the banks, before the offences were uncovered and the circumstances of the fraud established; and

> (5)     The lack of remorse shown by the accused in the manner that his defence was carried out, even after his misdeeds had been clearly exposed through the admissions in his statements, as well as the signed application and supporting documents from the banks. In this regard, while the accused was entitled to claim trial, he cannot expect the sentencing discount that offenders, such as those in the other cases cited by the Prosecution who had pleaded guilty, would have received.

### Relevant precedents

287    I move on now to deal with the cases cited by the Prosecution, and their relevance in determining the final sentence in the present case. I would add that I only considered the reported cases, rather than the unreported cases, as it was not clear how the sentences were arrived at for the latter (see the caution expressed by Chan Sek Keong CJ (as he then was) in _Luong Thi Trang Hoang Kathleen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 707</span> at \[21\] against relying on unreported decisions indiscriminately).

288    First, in _Chew Soo Chun_, the offender had applied for invoice financing loans using fictitious invoices to deceive the bank. His offences took place over about 5 months between June 2006 and November 2006. For this case:

> (a)     The total amount of the loans disbursed was $2.6 million and there were 26 charges under s 420 Penal Code framed against the offender for invoice financing fraud. The total loan amount in respect of the three charges proceeded with was $508,654.52. At the time of the judgment, it was indicated that the outstanding balance still owing to OCBC for all the charges was $932,282.19. The offender pleaded guilty and had shown considerable remorse. He was sentenced to 14 to 16 months’ imprisonment on each s 420 PC charge, involving sums of SGD 173,414.24, SGD 160,815.48 and SGD 174,424.80. The Court there made it explicitly clear that the sentence for the charge involving the sum of SGD 174,424.80 was reduced from 16 months to 14 months’ imprisonment on account of the offender’s ill-health. The appeal against the sentence was dismissed.

> (b)     In comparison, in the present case, the accused has similarly cheated banks into disbursing funds through fraudulent invoice financing loan applications. The sums involved were also comparable to those in _Chew Soo Chun_ albeit less for five of the six charges (USD 90,253.25 and USD 93,494.58 or equivalent to about SGD 127,000 to SGD 131,000), while the sum involved for the charge of cheating DBS was higher at USD 162,673.44 (equivalent to about SGD 229,000). Further, unlike in _Chew Soo Chun_, there was no evidence of remorse demonstrated by the accused. In addition, the accused here was convicted only after a long trial and thus, he could not expect to benefit from any sentencing discount for an early plea of guilt.

> (c)     Thus, leaving aside the question of ill-health, which will be dealt with at a later part of this judgment, it would appear that as compared with _Chew Soo Chun_, and bearing in mind _inter alia_ the quantum involved and the lack of a sentencing discount for the present case, but also noting that there was ultimately no loss caused to the banks here, the starting point for the sentence should be about 12 months’ imprisonment for the five charges involving USD 90,253.25 to USD 93,494.58 (SGD 127,000 to SGD 131,000), and about 18 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving US$162,673.44 (SGD229,000).

289    Moving on to the next case of _Tan Thiam Wee_:

> (a)     The offender there had submitted fictitious invoices to obtain loans from OCBC Bank when his company faced cashflow problems. A total of 176 invoices were submitted over a period of slightly more than a year, and the bank disbursed the sum of $2,622,508.12. The bank’s losses after the scheme unraveled amounted to $634,075.52.

> (b)     In respect of the 12 proceeded charges, the loans ranged from SGD 36,380 to SGD 42,064.38 and totalled SGD 478,433.70. There were 164 other charges to be taken into consideration for sentencing. The offender was originally sentenced to a global imprisonment term of 60 months’ imprisonment after he pleaded guilty (with four sentences of 15 months’ imprisonment running consecutively), and this sentence was reduced to 30 months’ imprisonment on appeal (with two sentences of 15 months’ imprisonment running consecutively). The High Court there gave significant mitigating weight to the fact that the offender’s motivation was to tide his company over its cashflow issues “so that his company could survive and his employees could remain in their jobs”, which the High Court considered to be “…vastly different from one where the perpetrator commits an offence for direct financial gain or to repay gambling debts“[^111]

> (c)     Such a strong mitigating factor was clearly absent in the present case, since the accused was clearly motivated by financial gain. Further, it should also be noted that the accused here had claimed trial, while the offender in _Tan Thiam Wee_ had pleaded guilty. However, the sums involved for all the charges there were almost three times the amount involved in the present charges, and the bank’s ultimate losses were also very significant. As such, factoring in the differences in the two cases, it would appear that a starting global sentence of about 42-45 months’ imprisonment in the present case, which was somewhere in between the sentence imposed by the District Court and the High Court in _Than Thiam Wee_, may be appropriate in the present case.

290    Moving on the three reported cases in the Prosecution’s sentencing table, all of which involved offenders who had been convicted of cheating banks to grant loans, I note that the offenders there had also pleaded guilty.

291    In _Ng Kheng Wah:_

> (a)     The amount involved in the 10 proceeded charges totalled USD 23 million, with the amounts for each charge being between USD 1.9 million to USD 2.8 million. Together with the charges taken into consideration for sentencing, the total amount involved was USD 95 million.

> (b)     The main offender in that case, Ng, had very strong mitigating factors. These included his early plea of guilt, his clean record, his high level of cooperation with the CAD, including his persuading an accomplice to come clean, his good character and his strong personal circumstances, including the huge losses he himself suffered, and his various medical conditions. There was also ultimately no loss caused to the banks. Ng was sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment per cheating charge, with three sentences to run consecutively, together with another 4 months’ imprisonment for other charges. His global sentence was 34 months’ imprisonment. In deciding his sentence, the court considered the cases of _Muthupandian_ (see below) and _Tan Thiam Wee_ as well.

> (c)     I was of the view that as compared to the accused in the present case, while the amount involved in Ng’s case was substantially higher, this was largely alleviated by the fact that (like in the present case) no loss was ultimately caused to the banks. There were also strong mitigating factors in Ng’s case which were clearly not present in the current case, such as Ng’s plea of guilt and his high level of co-operation with the authorities. Again, this suggested that the sentence to be imposed on the accused should be substantially higher than the consecutive 30 months’ imprisonment imposed for the cheating charges imposed on Ng.

292    In _Muthupandian:_

> (a)     The offenders conspired to cheat UOB by submitting fictitious invoices to obtain loans, dishonestly inducing UOB to deliver a total sum of about $1,577,019.50. The bank suffered no monetary loss, however, as the principal sums were repaid with interest to the bank in good time. The offences went undiscovered for several years, until one of the offender’s company was investigated for separate offences.

> (b)     Twelve charges of conspiring to cheat were brought against each offender, under s 420 read with s 109 of the PC. Each offender pleaded guilty to two charges (involving sums of about SGD240,000 and SGD 230,000), with the remaining charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offenders were untraced or had unrelated antecedents, and had co-operated fully with the authorities. They pleaded guilty and were each sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment (with a global sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment). Their appeal against sentence was dismissed.

> (c)     Clearly, the strong mitigating factors of the offenders’ plea of guilt, and co-operation with authorities in that case, were also absent in the present case. Again, this suggested that there should be a substantial uplift for the charges in the present case, from the sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment per charge imposed in _Muthupandian_

293    Finally, I deal with the case of _Rajan Natrajan_:

> (a)     Here, the offender had pleaded guilty in the midst of a trial (after 8 witnesses had been called) to a total of six charges. These comprised of one charge of conspiracy to cheat under section 420 read with section 109 of the PC \[involving disbursement of USD937,967.69\] and five charges of forgery under section 465 of the Penal Code. He consented to one charge of forgery being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. He was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months’ imprisonment for the s 420 charge PC. An appeal against sentence was dismissed.

> (b)     In sentencing him, the Court considered the need for deterrence, the substantial loss caused which exceeded SGD1.2 million for which no restitution was made to the bank, the offender’s abuse of authority, the difficulty in detection of the offences, the fact that the offences were pre-mediated and deliberate and spanned about four months, the fact that the offences were self-serving, and the general lack of mitigating factors.

> (c)     In so far as _Rajan Natrajan_ was useful, it was to suggest that the global sentence to impose on the accused here should not approximate the sentence (totaling 54 months’ imprisonment) imposed in _Rajan Natrajan_ since the banks here ultimately suffered no loss, as compared to the very substantial loss of SGD1.2 million suffered in that case.

294    Thus, as compared to the precedents above, aside from the sums involved in each charge, the main factors that I had to consider were that the accused has no previous convictions, that there was no actual loss suffered by the banks even though the extent of potential loss was substantial and, from the documents placed before me, he was generally of good character.

295    Based on these considerations, the aggravating factors discussed above, as well as the precedent cases, I was of the view that the appropriate sentence to impose would have been a global sentence of about 42 months’ imprisonment, made up of individual sentences of

> (a)     12 months’ imprisonment for each of the five charges involving amounts of between USD 90,253.25 and USD 93,494.58 \[with two of these sentences to run consecutively\]; and

> (b)     18 months’ imprisonment for the charge involving USD 162,673.44 (to run consecutively).

296    Before deciding on the final sentence, I move on to consider the main factor highlighted in the Defence’s mitigation plea, namely, the accused’s ill-health, and to determine if, and if so how, this should affect the global sentence.

### Ill health as a sentencing consideration

297    In _Chew Soo Chun_, the High Court explained that ill health can be relevant to sentencing in two ways. The Court stated:

> 38    … **_First, it is a ground for the exercise of judicial mercy. Judicial mercy is an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases and which will likely result in an exceptional sentence._** Where mercy is exercised, the court is compelled by humanitarian considerations arising from the exceptional circumstances to order the minimum imprisonment term or a non-custodial sentence where appropriate. **_Secondly, it exists as a mitigating factor. The cases where ill health will be regarded as a mitigating factor include those which do not fall within the realm of the exceptional but involve markedly disproportionate impact of an imprisonment term on an offender by reason of his ill health._** The court takes into account the fact that ill health may render an imprisonment term that will not otherwise be crushing to one offender but may be so to another, and attenuates the sentence accordingly for the latter offender so that it will not be disproportionate to his culpability and physical condition.

> 39    In all other cases, ill health is irrelevant to sentencing. It may be that the offender has a condition or several conditions, but unless he can satisfy the tests for exercising judicial mercy or for mitigating a sentence because of disproportionate suffering or decreased culpability, there is no proper basis to vary the sentence. Hence, it will be insufficient for an offender to merely show that he is ill. Even if the contention is that imprisonment would have a significantly adverse impact on an offender due to his ill health, the following conditions would have fallen short:

>> (a)    Conditions that can be addressed by certain procedures, such as surgery or treatment. If the prison has the capability of addressing the conditions to an acceptable standard (and by that, it means that the prison need not meet the best medical standard), they would be a neutral factor. This is because the conditions, once addressed, will no longer result in a greater impact on the offender.

>> (b)    Conditions that carry only the normal and inevitable consequences in the prison setting. If the consequences will transpire independently of whether the offender is in or outside of prison or the risk of them transpiring is not significantly enhanced by the imprisonment, then they are also a neutral factor as imprisonment would make no difference to the offender’s state of health or the suffering he will sustain in prison.

\[emphasis added\]

#### Accused’s medical condition

298    In the present case, counsel highlighted the accused’s ill-health, in particular, the fact that he has cancer, and asked the court to exercise judicial mercy in sentencing. As set out in the Defence’s documents:

> (a)     The accused was diagnosed in March 2018 with Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (CMML), a rare form of blood cancer with limited treatment options. The median survival period for patients with such conditions is less than 22 months from diagnosis.

> (b)     His doctor, Dr Lim ZiYi, in a letter dated 20 October 2020, further opined that the accused will:

>> …likely require continuous treatment for a definite period. As a result of the treatment, he will have a suppressed immune system rendering him susceptible to infections. He will require close specialist hematology input to manage his condition, and he will need to function in a clean and safe environment without crowds. Significant stress and poor nutrition will be of a significant adverse impact to his prognosis. A sentence of imprisonment for \[the accused\] at his age, with his haematological condition (along with his associated medical conditions of diabetes and hypertension) will carry a significant negative impact on his survival.

299    Arising from the issues raised by the Defence in connection with the accused’s medical conditions, the accused’s medical reports and blood test results were provided to the Singapore Prisons Service (SPS) for assessment. Based on these documents, Dr Yeo Kuang Lim, Assistant Director, Medical Operations, SPS, stated in a letter dated 12 October 2020 that:

> (a)     SPS has had experience dealing with inmates with a variety of medical conditions, including those stated in the medical reports tendered in respect of the accused, and that it has an adequate system of healthcare to manage the accused “…and to ensure that his health would not be adversely affected as a result of the incarceration.”

> (b)     Further, “(a)ll prison inmates are given the appropriate level of medical care and treatment as may be required, including referral to a restructured hospital for treatment and management of serious medical conditions. The \[accused\] would have to continue his treatment at a public health institution e.g. National Cancer Centre, should he be admitted to prison.”

300    In another letter dated 24 November 2020, Dr Yeo stated that the diagnosis of CMML would fall within the definition of terminal illness within the general understanding of the term used by the medical fraternity. As for whether the accused’s condition was such that being imprisoned would carry a high risk of endangering his life, or would cause disproportionate suffering e.g. constituted by a risk of significant deterioration in health or a significant exacerbation of pain and suffering, Dr Yeo stated that:

>     \[The accused\] would be given all the necessary medical treatment for his terminal illness at a public healthcare institution such as the National Cancer Centre, any restructured hospital and his medical condition will be managed by medical specialists and healthcare professionals. SPS will facilitate his treatment and care at any of these medical facilities.

>     As to the question whether imprisonment would cause "disproportionate suffering e.g. constituted by a risk of significant deterioration in health or a significant exacerbation of pain and suffering", I am unable to comment on this as this is a subjective matter.

#### Whether judicial mercy should be exercised

301    I first consider whether judicial mercy should be exercised in the present case. In this regard, as stated by the High Court in _Chew Soo Chun_, judicial mercy **_“…is an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases…”_** As for what could constitute “truly exceptional cases” deserving of judicial mercy, the High Court did not set out an exhaustive definition. Instead at \[27\], the Court stated that:

>     \[27\] …. exceptional circumstances include terminal illness, or conditions that will lead to an endangerment of life by reason of either the imprisonment or the deprivation of certain necessaries during imprisonment which an offender critically depends on to enhance his prospects of recovery. It will, in principle, also include other circumstances that are equally grave. To establish any of these circumstances, there would of course have to be clear evidence. **_It would only be proper to exercise judicial mercy if the test of exceptionality has been satisfied_** **_and there is an absence of overwhelming, countervailing public interest considerations which favour punishment_****_._**

\[emphasis added\]

302    In _Chew Soo Chun_ itself, the High Court agreed with the district judge that judicial mercy did not apply on the facts. Specifically, commenting on the offender’s condition of cancer, the High Court stated at \[56\]:

>     ...the cancer is also not a condition which dictates that judicial mercy should necessarily be exercised in his favour. The short response to Mr Fong’s argument is that it is not a principle of judicial mercy that an offender who suffers from many conditions should be shown mercy; the test is more nuanced than that. **_It inquires into whether the conditions suffered by the offender are so serious that he has not much longer to live or sending him to prison is going to endanger his life or will occasion something of equivalent gravity_** (see \[27\] above). Nothing, however, is said to this effect in the medical reports. Although there is consensus in the reports that the Offender’s health will worsen in prison, one has to go further than that to justify the exercise of mercy.

\[emphasis added\]

303    The Court also took note of the letter from the prison authorities. There the prison authorities had stated[^112]:

>     We have reviewed your client’s medical and psychiatric conditions based on the forwarded medical reports. Please be informed that we will be able to manage your client’s condition should he be incarcerated. Care will be coordinated with psychiatric services and specialist services from the restructured hospitals. He may require ward-based care in our medical centre for the duration of his incarceration.

304    Thereafter, at \[58\], the Court stated that “\[the prison authorities’ letter\] points away from the case as being exceptional…We agree with the DJ that judicial mercy is not warranted here.”

305    In the recent case of _VDZ v VEA_ \[20201 SGCA 75 (“_VDZ_”), another case cited by the Defence, the Court of Appeal (“the CA”) had to consider the situation of an appellant who had been sentenced to imprisonment of one week after she was found guilty by the High Court of contempt of court.

306    When the appellant’s case was considered by the CA, it was revealed that she had stage 4 breast cancer, and that the cancer had taken a serious toll on her health. The SPS medical officer who had examined her informed the court that the appellant was unfit for incarceration at that time, and that she had critically low red blood cell, and that she was especially susceptible to infections as she had open wounds in her chest. At the time of her examination by the SPS medical officer, the appellant was clinically wheelchair bound and weighed only 29.9 kg.[^113] After a review of the circumstances, the CA substituted her one-week imprisonment with a fine of $5,000. At \[72\], the CA explained:

>     It was clear that her path forward would not be easy, as she would have to undergo strenuous medical treatments to attempt to improve her condition. In the circumstances, we were of the view that the humanitarian considerations supporting the exercise of judicial mercy should apply.

307    Before coming to its decision, the CA at \[70\] emphasized that it was not every offender with a terminal illness who will “invariably be treated with kid gloves.” (endorsing the remarks of VK Rajah J in _Chng Yew Chin v Public Prosecutor_ at \[67\]). The CA had noted that VK Rajah J had also made clear in _Chng Yew Chin_ that myriad considerations have to be taken into account with judicial mercy is “….to be resorted to only in limited and exceptional circumstances.”

308    Applying the above principles, I was of the view that this was not an appropriate case for the exercise of judicial mercy. My reasons are as follows:

> (a)     I would first reiterate the clear reminder made by the High Court in _Chew Soo Chun_ that judicial mercy “…is an exceptional recourse available for truly exceptional cases…”. Essentially the same message was delivered by the CA in _VVDZ when_ it endorsed VK Rajah J’s reminder in _Chng Yew Chin_ that judicial mercy “….to be resorted to only in limited and exceptional circumstances.”

> (b)     Even for offenders with terminal illnesses, there is no automatic entitlement to the exercise of judicial mercy. Instead, as noted by the the High Court in _Chew Soo Chun_ at \[27\] “(i)t would only be proper to exercise judicial mercy if the test of exceptionality has been satisfied and there is an absence of overwhelming, countervailing public interest considerations which favour punishment.” The CA in _VDZ_ at \[70\] had similarly endorsed the position that it was not every offender with a terminal illness who will “invariably be treated with kid gloves.”

> (c)     In the present case, while it was not disputed that the accused did suffer from a terminal illness, the fact remains that he had been convicted after trial of a number of very serious cheating offences, involving various financial institutions, and large sums of money. As discussed above, there was a lack of remorse demonstrated, the offences were planned and premediated, and deterrence was clearly the dominant sentencing principle (see \[286\] above). Indeed, the relevant sentencing precedents showed that offenders who had committed similar offences, had all been sentenced to heavy sentences, even when they pleaded guilty and demonstrated remorse. In the case of the accused, the circumstances of his offences, would also suggest that similarly heavy sentences should be imposed for the offences that he had committed, and been convicted of after a long trial.

> (d)     Under such circumstances, it could hardly be said that “…there is an absence of overwhelming, countervailing public interest considerations which favour punishment”. Instead, in light of the need for deterrence for such offences targeting our financial institutions, and the other aggravating features of the case, and consistent with the remarks of the CA in _VDZ_, this was clearly a case where the accused should not be “treated with kid’s gloves”.

> (e)     Further, since the exercise of judicial mercy would suggest that essentially the minimal sentence would be imposed (which in this case meant a global sentence of two days’ imprisonment), this was clearly not an appropriate result in the present case, in light of the much higher sentences that should otherwise be imposed on him, and the clear public interest considerations which favour punishment. Indeed, it could even be argued that to grant judicial mercy (and impose a light sentence) on any offender who suffers from a terminal illness, would be akin to giving such offenders _carte blanche_ to commit further serious offences with virtual impunity. This cannot be right. Judicial mercy should and must only be exercised in exceptional cases, for which this was not one.

> (f)     In addition, I would add that unlike the situation in _VDZ_, where quite exceptionally, the SPS made it clear that the condition of the offender was such that she was unfit for incarceration, the SPS in the present case had considered the myriad reports and test results of the accused, and had come to the exact opposite conclusion, namely that it has an adequate system of healthcare to manage the accused, AND to ensure that his health would not be adversely affected as a result of the incarceration. Indeed, Dr Yeo from SPS had given the further assurance that the accused would, if necessary, be referred to a restructured hospital for treatment and management of serious medical conditions, and that he would be able to continue his treatment at a public health institution e.g. National Cancer Centre, should he be admitted to prison.

> (g)     In short, this was not a proper case to exercise judicial mercy.

#### Ill health as a mitigating circumstance

309    While I have declined to exercise judicial mercy as sought by the Defence, the question remains whether the accused’s medical condition and his terminal illness, should still be considered in sentencing.

310    As regards whether ill-health should nonetheless constitute a mitigating circumstance, the Court in _Chew Soo Chun_ had also stated at \[29\]:

>     Aside from cases falling within the realm of the exceptional, there are also cases where a term of incarceration would cause an offender a greater and disproportional impact because of his ill health than it would on an ordinary person who is not suffering from the same medical condition. The principle of proportionality will apply in such cases such that the court will need to consider how to adjust the sentence with a view to equalising the burden, even though the court cannot and will not exercise judicial mercy.

311    Further at \[34\], the Court stated:

>     …. the question is very much one of whether the offender faces far greater suffering than the usual hardship in serving a term of imprisonment. This depends on the possible consequences of the offender’s medical condition, which may, in turn, be contingent on other surrounding circumstances. But generally, it is constituted by a risk of significant deterioration in health or a significant exacerbation of pain and suffering. Where the impact on the offender does rise to such a sufficiently serious level, it causes the sentence that is otherwise appropriate with regard to the offence committed, to be out of line on the ground of proportionality. Consequently, the sentence ought to be mitigated, because other things being equal, offenders ought to be subject to the same impact.

312    In _Chew Soo Chun_, the High Court agreed that the offender’s ill health, particularly his mental disorders, would pose problems for him in prison. At \[61\], the Court opined that: “The broad statement by the prison authorities that they can manage the Offender’s condition does not quite contradict the medical reports, since it did not clearly state that they can prevent disproportionate suffering on the part of the Offender.” Accordingly, the High Court endorsed the approach of the district judge to reduce the global sentence of the offender by 6 months due to his health condition.

313    In the recent decision of _Goh Chin Soon v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGHC 162</span>, the offender was convicted of Immigration Act and Passports Act offences. In that case, various medical reports were tendered which essentially alluded to the offender as being “at an increased risk for heart attack and sudden cardiac death” and “at a high risk of stroke”. After reviewing the position set out in _Chew Soo Chun_, Justice Hoo Sheau Peng stated at \[165\]:

>     ….in order to rely on ill health for a reduction in sentence, the offender must do more than “merely show that he is ill”. This suggests that the burden is on the offender to present at least _some_ evidence directed towards suggesting specifically that _imprisonment_ would have a significantly adverse impact on his health. This would therefore normally be a matter that should be addressed in the medical evidence adduced on the offender’s behalf. This would involve some articulation on the part of medical professionals who are familiar with the offender’s medical conditions as to the basis they may have for believing or fearing that imprisonment would adversely affect the offender’s health. Only then would the evidential burden shift to the Prosecution to adduce evidence to the contrary, such as by showing that SPS is fully capable of addressing the medical issues raised on the offender’s behalf while he is in prison.

314    In deciding against exercising judicial mercy or to consider the offender’s ill-health to be a mitigating factor, Hoo J stated at \[166\]:

>     In the present case, the appellant did not contend that he deserved judicial mercy because of a terminal illness, and rightly so. Instead, he contended that imprisonment would carry a high risk of endangering his life. **_In my view, however, the medical reports relied upon by the appellant did little more than to merely show that he was ill._**.. The appellant’s ill health therefore did not constitute a mitigating factor, much less a basis for the exercise of judicial mercy.

\[emphasis added\]

315    In the present case, while I have explained why I decided that it was not appropriate to exercise judicial mercy, I was of the view that the accused’s medical condition was a mitigating factor that should be given appropriate weight. My views are as follows:

> (a)     First, there was no dispute that the accused suffers from a terminal illness. All the reports and results put up by Dr Lim ZiYi for the Defence pointed clearly to this. These same reports had been examined by Dr Yeo Kuang Lim from SPS and were not disputed by Dr Yeo. I would add that the diagnosis for the accused, which was made in March 2018, was that for patients with the same of condition of CMML as the accused, the median survival period for is less than 22 months from diagnosis.

> (b)     Second, as a result of the accused’s medical condition, Dr Lim had explained that the accused “will have a suppressed immune system rendering him susceptible to infections.” Further, it was indicated that the accused “…will require close specialist hematology input to manage his condition, and he will need to function in a clean and safe environment without crowds. Significant stress and poor nutrition will be of a significant adverse impact to his prognosis. A sentence of imprisonment for \[the accused\] at his age, with his haematological condition (along with his associated medical conditions of diabetes and hypertension) will carry a significant negative impact on his survival.”

> (c)     Thus, in sharp contrast to the situation in _Goh Chin Soon_, where Hoo J had noted that the “…the medical reports relied upon by the appellant did little more than to merely show that he was ill”, the medical reports in the present case showed not only the very serious extent and terminal nature of the accused’s ailment, they also made clear the possible serious difficulties that he would face from incarceration.

> (d)     I would also add that these challenges and the corresponding suffering that would result, would likely be exacerbated by the accused’s advanced age of 75 years, a factor highlighted by Dr Lim. Indeed, even by itself, mature age can be a mitigating circumstance. In this regard, when discussing the issue of an offender’s age as a mitigating factor, Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Yap Ah Lai v Public Prosecutor <span class="citation">\[2014\] 3 SLR 180</span>_ had noted at \[91\]:

>> In relation to the offender's prospects of his future life expectation, the principle of equal impact explains why some mitigation may be appropriate. The principle is that "when an offender suffers from certain handicaps that would make his punishment significantly more onerous, the sanction should be adjusted in order to avoid its having an undue differential impact on him": Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth, _Proportionate Sentencing: Exploring the Principles_ (Oxford University Press, 2005) ("_Proportionate Sentencing_") at p 172. Therefore a sanction may be lightened where it may have an undue or disproportionate impact on the offender: _Proportionate Sentencing_ at p 176. **_The consideration particularly pertinent in relation to an elderly offender is the prospect that a jail term may mean spending much of the rest of his life in prison_**. This was indeed the principle to which the Court of Appeal in _PP v UI_ (\[58\] _supra_) was giving voice in the passage cited above. This is justified not because the court is extending mercy to the offender in view of his advanced age, but because the court is unwilling to make such offenders suffer _more_ than others who are similarly situated: see _Proportionate Sentencing_ at p 173.

\[emphasis added\]

> Thus, in the context of the accused who has a terminal illness, and hence a reduced life expectancy, his advanced age was even more relevant.

> (e)     Finally, I note that on the issue of whether the accused’s condition was such that being imprisoned would cause disproportionate suffering, other than expressing that they could manage the accused’s medical condition, Dr Yeo from the SPS was not able to give a definitive comment on this specific issue, other than state that “this is a subjective matter.” In that regard, I note that in _Chew Soo Chun_, in deciding that the medical condition of the offender constituted a mitigating factor, the High Court had similarly noted that the statement from the prison authorities “….did not clearly state that they can prevent disproportionate suffering on the part of the Offender.”

316    In short, as in Chew Soo Chun, where a reduction of six months’ imprisonment was considered appropriate, I was of the view that in light of the factors set out above, in particular the accused’s terminal illness and the consequential challenges and suffering that would ensue, as well as the accused’s advanced age, a similar reduction in sentence should be made here.

### Global sentence

317    All in all, taking into account the aggravating factors, mitigating factors, and relevant sentencing precedents, I sentenced the accused as follows:

> (a)     10 months’ imprisonment each for DAC-943115-2017 to DAC-943118-2017 and DAC- 943156-2017;

> (b)     16 months’ imprisonment for DAC-943114-2017; and

> (c)     The sentences for DAC-943114-2017, DAC-943115-2017 and DAC-943116-2017 would run consecutively, and the remaining sentences concurrently. The global sentence is 36 months’ imprisonment.

318    Finally, it leaves me to thank counsel and the DPPs for coming up with detailed and useful submissions, which were of immense assistance to the Court in arriving at the verdict and sentence in this case.
