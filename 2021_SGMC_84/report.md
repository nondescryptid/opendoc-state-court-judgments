### District Judge Eddy Tham Tong Kong:

## INTRODUCTION

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused. The Accused had pleaded guilty to two charges: one for installing an equipment to record a private act of a person without the person’s consent, an offence under section 377BB(6) and punishable under 377BB(7) of the Penal Code (Cap. 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) and another for destroying the electronic record of the recording to prevent its production as evidence in court, an offence under section 204 of the PC.

2       I sentenced the Accused as follows:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="21.28%"> <col width="58.76%"> <col width="19.96%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Charge number</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Offence</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Sentence</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-903526-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">…you, on the 10th day of August 2020, at or about 9.04pm, in the male toilet of Anytime Fitness @ HillV2, 4 Hillview Rise #02-18/19 Singapore 667979, did install equipment with the intention of enabling yourself to record another person doing a private act without the person’s consent, an offence under s 377BB(3) of the PC, to wit, by installing a spy camera device, disguised as a clothing hook, that could record videos onto a memory storage card, under the hand dryer of the said male toilet and pointing it towards the toilet bowl, with the intention of recording male toilet users urinating without their consent, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 377BB(6) of the PC, punishable under s 377BB(7) of the PC.</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">MAC-903502-2021</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">…. that you, on the 11th day of August 2020, sometime after 2.24am, at the rubbish chute located at level 6 of Blk 460 Segar Road, Singapore 670460, did destroy an electronic record, to wit, a spy camera device and one SD memory card, which you may be lawfully compelled to produce as evidence in a court of justice, to wit, the whole of the said electronic record as evidence before the court, with the intention of preventing the same from being produced as evidence before such court, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 204 of the PC.</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

3       I ordered the sentences of imprisonment imposed for both charges to run consecutively, giving a total sentence of six months’ imprisonment.

4       The Accused had applied for probation and in the alternative for a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) report to be called. I refused to call for any reports to assess the Accused’s suitability for either regime as I did not consider them to be suitable sentencing options for the Accused.

5       Being dissatisfied with the sentence, he has filed a notice of appeal against sentence. The Accused has been released on bail pending the appeal.

6       I now set out the grounds of my decision.

## THE STATEMENT OF FACTS

7       The Accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution.

### Background Information

8       I set out the facts as contained in the Statement of Facts.

9       The Accused is Sean Lee Yang, a 27-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time of the offences, the Accused was residing at Block 460 Segar Road, #XXX, Singapore 670460 (“his Block”). He had just graduated from the National University of Singapore at the material time and was unemployed.

10     The complainant is Tee Chor Hein, the then area manager of Anytime Fitness Pte Ltd (“Anytime Fitness”). Anytime Fitness is a chain of fitness gyms with some of them operating 24/7 located in various parts of Singapore. He oversaw the Anytime Fitness gym located at 4 Hillview Rise, #02-18/19, HillV2, Singapore 667979 (the “Gym”).

11     Members of the Gym must pay a membership fee to use the facilities in the Gym.

12     The witness is Muhammad Rasydan bin Mustafar Kamir (“Rasydan”). He was a cleaner at the Gym at the material time.

### First Information Report

13     On 11 August 2020 at about 5.51pm, the complainant lodged a police report stating that one of his cleaners found a black hook in a toilet at the Gym. The cleaner took it apart and discovered that it was a spy camera with a SD-card attached to it.

### Facts relating to the charge (MAC-903526-2021)

14     About two weeks prior to the incident, the Accused bought a spy camera disguised as a clothing hook from Lazada. He bought it with the intention to use the device to covertly view men urinating as he had a fetish for such videos. The spy camera had an in-built battery. It also contained a memory/SD-card to save the recorded videos.

15     The Accused started to experiment with the device by installing it at the male toilet of the Gym on prior occasions without discovery. He went to the Gym at different times of the day about two or three times a week. While changing into his gym attire, he would plant the device under the hand dryer in the male toilet, with the device facing the toilet bowl. After he was done with his gym session, about 45 minutes to one hour later, he would retrieve the device from the wall of the toilet and bring it home. At home, he would view the videos captured through the SD-card which he inserted into his laptop. He would filter the videos by discarding the videos which did not capture men urinating and keeping the videos which captured the penises of men urinating. He then viewed the videos for his own pleasure. The Accused had been doing this for some one to two weeks prior to the material day.

16     On 10 August 2020, at about 9.03pm, the Accused entered the Gym and brought the spy camera along. At about 9.04pm, he proceeded to the male toilet on the pretext of changing into his gym attire, and planted the device, by pasting it with a double-sided tape, on the wall beside the toilet door below the hand dryer. He did so with the intention of recording men urinating, which is a private act, without their consent, an offence under s 377BB(3) of the PC. At about 9.07pm, the Accused left the toilet and went to exercise at the Gym.

17     On 10 August 2020, at about 9.20pm, Rasydan entered the male toilet to wash it. The male toilet is the only male toilet in the Gym. He discovered that there was a dark coloured hook (about 7cm in length) lodged under the hand dryer in the toilet. The hook was attached to the wall and was facing the direction of the toilet bowl. Rasydan had seen the hook there for about a week prior to that. At all times, the hook was facing the toilet bowl and was placed below the hand dryer.

18     Rasydan became suspicious as it was not usual for a hook to be placed there. He removed the hook from the wall. He then turned it around and saw a memory card slot with a SD-card and a USB port in the hook. Upon closer inspection, he noticed that there was a camera in the top hole of the hook, facing the direction of the toilet bowl.

19     After making the discovery that a camera had been hidden in the male toilet, Rasydan brought the device out of the toilet and handed it over to a staff member at the Gym at about 10.05pm.

20     By installing an equipment with the intention of enabling himself to commit an offence under s 377BB(3) of the PC, the Accused has committed an offence under s 377BB(6) of the PC, punishable under section 377BB(7) of the PC.

### Facts relating to the charge (MAC-903502-2021)

21     While he was exercising, the Accused noticed a staff member holding onto the device which he had planted and discussing it with other staff members. At about 10.07pm, the staff member was instructed by management to leave the device in the drawer located in the staff office. At about 10.24pm, he did so and shut the door to the office. The Accused observed this.

22     As the Accused person knew that his device had been discovered, he decided to wait around in the Gym, intermittently exercising in the gym, for the coast to be clear to retrieve the spy camera from the office. He continued to keep watch of the office from 10.24pm till about 2.24am. When the staff member went to take a toilet break, and the office was empty, the Accused immediately took the opportunity to enter the office at about 2.24am on 11 August 2020. In the office, the Accused took out the device from the drawer and left the office. He then entered the male toilet at about 2.26am. He left the Gym at about 2.31am on 11 August 2020 with the device in stow.

23     As the Accused was scared, with the intention of preventing the device and the recorded videos stored in the device from being used as evidence in court against him, he disposed of the device and the SD-card by discarding them into the rubbish chute at level 6 of his Block, thereby destroying it. The device, and the incriminating videos stored in the SD-card, were not found, or recovered. The device containing the SD-card is an electronic record within the definition of s 29B of the PC.

24     On 11 August 2020, at about 12.00pm, the complainant proceeded to the Gym to conduct a check on the device. He then discovered that the device was missing from the drawer. The complainant then went through the CCTV footage located at the Gym and discovered that the Accused had taken the said device out of the drawer in the office. The Accused was caught on CCTV camera going in and out of the Gym, the male toilet and the office. The complainant then lodged a police report.

25     By destroying an electronic record with the intention of preventing the same from being used as evidence in court, the Accused has committed an offence under s 204 of the PC.

## ANTECEDENTS

26     The Accused does not have any previous convictions.

## PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSION ON SENTENCE

27     The Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of 7-9 months’ imprisonment on the following breakdown:

> (i)     DAC 903526/2021 : 12-15 weeks’ imprisonment to run consecutively with

> (ii)     DAC 903502/2021 : 4-5 months’ imprisonment.

28     The Prosecution in asking for the sentence under section 377BB(6) punishable under section 377BB(7) PC based on increase in the prescribed punishment for voyeurism from one year (under section 506 of the PC) to two years’ imprisonment under s 377BB(7) of the Penal Code show that this offence must be met with greater punitive force.

29     The Prosecution also highlighted the following aggravating factors for the offence under section 377BB(6):

> i    The Accused had applied a great degree of foresight, planning and premeditation prior to the commission of the offence by buying a spy camera some two weeks prior to the commission of the offence and had experimented with the spy camera before the eventual day of the offence. He then planted the spy camera in an unsuspecting location below the hand dryer in the male toilet to escape detection and in a vantage position to record men’s exposed penises in the act of urinating.

> ii     The captured recordings could be repeatedly re-viewed by the offender, or even disseminated to third parties;

> iii     The use of miniaturised, disguised, or hidden cameras to record films of unsuspecting men in public/private toilets causes fear and unease amongst members of the public that the privacy of men may be violated when they use the toilet.

> iv     The offence was the last of a course of conduct that took place over one to two weeks involving multiple victims involved who were not identified as the recorded videos were not recovered

> v    The Accused abused his position as a member of Anytime Fitness, whereby there was implicit trust placed in him as a fellow member.

> vi     Such offences are extremely difficult to detect. The camera was hidden from sight and took the form of an innocuous item like a wall hook, which toilet users may not be inclined to take a second glance. The recording went undetected for a period of one to two weeks prior to the offence.

> vii     The level of intrusion by virtue of planting the videos in the male toilet is high. It would have captured the genitalia (exposed penises) of the men as well as them doing a private act of relieving themselves.

30     As for the offence under section 204 of the PC, the Prosecution highlighted as aggravating that the Accused had waited for 4 hours until the wee hours of the morning in order to get hold of the incriminating evidence thus showing a high degree of pre-meditation. They also pointed out to the risk of distribution of the recorded material should anyone get hold of the discarded SD card.

31     I shall deal with the sentencing precedents tendered by prosecution below.

## MITIGATION

32     The Defence Counsel set out in the written mitigation plea that the Accused graduated in August 2020 from National University of Singapore with a 2nd Lower Honours Bachelor of Arts and Social Sciences (major in Economics) degree. He found employment in October 2020 and is currently working with the Union Bank of Switzerland.

33     The Defence Counsel informed that the Accused was sexually assaulted by his teacher when he was in Primary 3 in a school in Thailand for a period of 6 months. The Defence Counsel stated that he was instructed that the Accused had told the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) psychiatrist about this fact and the Accused was informed that he was suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”). The Defence Counsel further informed that the Accused was still undergoing treatment at IMH.

34     The Defence Counsel then urged the court to place the Accused on probation or under an MTO. At paragraph 8 of the written mitigation plea, the Defence Counsel highlighted that the medical reports from IMH attached state that the Accused had medical conditions which relate to the commission of the offences.

## THE COURT’S DECISION ON SENTENCE

### The sentencing principles

35     Prosecution highlighted a media report that incidents of voyeurism are on an upward trend in Singapore with such acts being facilitated by advancements in technology. Although the statistics were not produced, I am well aware that this is clearly a growing problem with such cases being frequently reported in the media. This issue was clearly grave enough for Parliament to enact section 377BB of the Penal Code with higher penalties to deal with this kind of offences. In the Second Reading of the Bill, the Minister for Home Affairs Mr K Shanmugam explained the need for this legislation clearly:

> “The proposed maximum imprisonment terms for the observance, possession and making of such “voyeuristic recordings” is now going to be two years if the Bill gets passed. That is double the current maximum one-year punishment for the offence of insulting modesty under section 509. There is, I think, a clear need to deter the proliferation of voyeuristic recordings”[^1].

36     Hence, clearly, the principle of sentencing in the present case is predominantly that of deterrence.

37     The Accused was 25 years old (date of birth: 17 September 1994) at the time of the offence. He was well within the age of adulthood and not someone who has just turned 21.

### The case for probation

38     Paragraph 32 of the Prosecution’s submission on sentence stated that probation is not an option under section 5(1)(a) of the Probation of Offenders Act given that the Accused has reached 21 years old. This is incorrect as section 5(1)(a) of the Act only prescribes that such an adult offender would only be denied probation for an offence for “which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law”. In the present case, neither of the charges to which the Accused had been convicted of carries such a type of minimum sentence. Section 377BB(7) of the PC provides for punishment of imprisonment which may extend up to 2 years or fine or caning or any combination of such punishments. Section 204 of the PC provides for punishment of imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or fine, or both. Accordingly, probation is still an option open to the Accused.

39     However, given that he is an adult, the applicable principle would be that as laid down by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Siow Kai Yuan Terence_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 4 SLR 1412</span> (“_Terence Siow_”), which is that where deterrence was the operative sentencing consideration for that offence, unless there existed exceptional circumstances or the offender could demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform, a sentence that places more emphasis on deterrence would be appropriate.

40     The Defence did not assert that there were any exceptional circumstances in this case and neither did I find any. The Accused had embarked on a plan for him to indulge in his fetish through installing a spy camera in a toilet to prey on unsuspecting males. When he was found out, he took steps to remove the evidence in an attempt to escape the law.

41     As for the requirement of demonstrating an extremely strong propensity for reform, the High Court in _Terence Siow_ applied the following 3-limbed framework (at \[55\]):

> i    Whether the offender has demonstrated a positive desire to change since the commission of the offences;

> ii     Whether there are conditions in the offender’s life that are conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf; and

> iii     If after considering the first two limbs, the Court comes to a provisional view that the offender has demonstrated an extremely strong propensity for reform, then to consider whether in the light of the risk factors presented, there are reasons to revisit the finding of such a high capacity for reform.

42     Applying the facts to the first limb, the Defence did not highlight any factors that point towards a positive desire for change.

43     Rather, only the medical reports of the Accused were highlighted and emphasis placed on the fact that the Accused had shown improvement ever since he had started treatment in that he had no more voyeuristic urges and no fresh police case.

44     Whilst this does demonstrate that the Accused had made some effort to obtain medical treatment, it did not impress me as a strong indication of a positive desire to change. In the IMH report from Dr. Somnath Sengupta (“Dr Sengupta”) dated 9 June 2021, it was stated that the Accused was seen 3 times in IMH, with the first time on 13 August 2020, being a referral by the police as part of their investigations into the offences committed by the Accused. Accordingly, the Accused had only gone on his own twice, once on 13 October 2020 and the last occasion on 12 January 2021. I note further that the treatment given, in the form of medication, was really directed towards his diagnosis dysthymia with panic and PTSD symptoms. On his later visit, the Accused reported improvement in his mood, anxiety and sleep problems and was advised to continue with the same medication. There appeared to be nothing done by the Accused to seek help targeting specifically his voyeuristic urges. I also noted that in terms of the cessation of voyeuristic urges, this was self-reported. Hence, I was not inclined to place too much weight on this assertion, bearing in mind that voyeuristic urges and other activities related to them such as the watching of pornography would take place within the privacy of the Accused’s world and hence difficult to be monitored and supervised.

45     I considered his plea of guilty as a sign of remorse and consequently a desire to change. However, this has to be discounted in the light of him being caught red-handed by the CCTV footage going into the office to remove the incriminating evidence. In the face of such strong incontrovertible evidence, the Accused would have little choice but to plead guilty.

46     Finally, the fact that he has not re-offended may point towards a positive desire to change. However, as observed in _Terence Siow_ at \[56(d\] the significance of this factor would depend on the length of the period between the time of the offence and when the offender is eventually sentenced. Hence, this was found a significant factor in _A Karthik v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 1289</span> where the period of non-offending was more than 5 years. However, in the present case, this period is only about 14 months and thus would not constitute a significant factor.

47     Going into the second limb, other than the fact that the Accused was gainfully employed, there is nothing else highlighted to show that there are conditions in his life that are conducive to helping him turn over a new leaf.

48     Thus, on the whole I did not find that the Accused has demonstrated “an extremely strong propensity for reform”, and thus found that rehabilitation has clearly not displaced deterrence as the primary sentencing consideration. Accordingly probation is clearly not an appropriate sentencing option and I therefore found no necessity to call for a probation report to assess the suitability of the Accused for this regime.

### The Case for MTO

49     I found little basis for the calling of a MTO report as the Accused’s medical reports fell woefully short of what is required to even consider the possibility of MTO as an appropriate sentencing option. In his concluding sentence in the IMH report dated the 9 October, Dr Sengupta had opined that Accused’s act of alleged voyeuristic behaviour was most likely based on his impulses to gratify his sexual urges only. There was nothing in the IMH report that drew a link between his diagnosed condition of dysthymia and his offending behaviour. In fact, the Accused had recounted to the doctor that his journey into his voyeuristic behaviour started with him getting aroused through watching pornography which later led to him having recurrent urges to watch unsuspecting male naked persons. This finally culminated in him acting on these urges with the purchase of the spy camera and its installation in the male toilet.

50     Under section 339(3)(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the psychiatric condition of the offender must be one of the contributing factors for him committing the offence before the Court can make an MTO. In the present case, the Accused has committed the offence under section 377BB(6) of the PC to satisfy his voyeuristic urges. As aptly observed by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span> (“_Chong Hou En_”), at\[55\], voyeurism is a clinical description for what is essentially a perverse behavioural option that does not deprive a person of his self-control. Further, although the Accused has been diagnosed with voyeurism, it was noted in _Chong Hou En_ at \[26\] that the court must pay particular attention to the nature of the mental disorder “when the disorder was one which would invariably manifest itself in the doing of the very act which was criminalised”. Therefore the question to be asked is not whether voyeurism has a causal link to the offending behaviour of the Accused, which would invariably be answered in the affirmative. Rather, the Court should look at whether the Accused was suffering from any psychiatric condition that was a contributing factor to his voyeuristic behaviour and there is certainly none here.

51     As evidenced by the facts of the case, there was nothing impulsive about the acts of the Accused leading to the commission of the offence. He had thought through what he intended to do from the selection and purchase of a spy camera to experimenting with the recording on different times of the day and on 2 or 3 occasions per week for the preceding 2 weeks without being detected. It is quite well established that voyeurism is not an impulse-control disorder. The Accused clearly retained full control of himself to be able to exercise self-restraint and refrain from committing the present offence. As such, voyeurism is clearly not a relevant mitigating factor for this offence and is not a good ground for the making of an MTO.

52     In relation to the second offence, when the Accused realised that his device had been detected and recovered, he had the presence of mind to observe and wait patiently for 4 hours for the opportune time to enter the office to retrieve the spy camera.

53     The Accused had clearly acted with deliberation and a composed mind. He did not get into a panic and own up immediately to his wrongdoing but instead was able to process through a plan to try to get away scot-free.

54     Accordingly, I found that there is no room for the Accused to be considered for a MTO and thus did not find it necessary to waste the resources of IMH to prepare an assessment on MTO suitability.

### The Sentences of Imprisonment

#### Sentence for the section 377BB(6) of the PC offence

55     I found that the custodial threshold for the section 377BB(6) PC offence has clearly been crossed. The degree of intrusion is high. The recording was of a very private part of the male body, the penis and of victims doing a private act of urination whilst in a private space of the Gym toilet. Although the number of victims is unknown, the number would unlikely be small if one takes into account all the recordings done over the past 2 weeks. The frequency of usage would also likely be high given that there was only one toilet in the gymnasium.

56     The culpability of the Accused is moderately high. He purchased a spy camera that was disguised as an innocuous clothing hook, designed to be inconspicuous and ordinary looking. But for the alertness of Rasydan and his decision to check on the hook, the crime would have continued to go on undetected for much longer. The Accused bought the item from Lazada, which suggests that such devices are easily accessible to the public. A strong deterrent message need to be sent out to turn away like-minded persons from being tempted to embark on such a course.

57     The Prosecution has tendered a list of 7 precedent cases for similar offences punishable under section 377BB(7) of the PC. Sentences of imprisonment were imposed which ranged from 8 weeks to 15 weeks. In particular there is one case that involved the use of a spy camera, _Public Prosecutor v Ong Chin Chye_ (SC-901220-2021) (“_Ong Chin Chye_”). The offender had committed the offence with the intention of viewing his wife showering. He was sentenced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution pointed out that there was only one victim and furthermore, the offender was caught right after the act, in contrast to the present Accused who had been doing recording for about 1- 2 weeks.

58     I found the facts in _Ong Chin Chye_ slightly more aggravating in that there was an element of breach of trust given the relationship of husband and wife and the fact that the intrusion took place within the sanctity and privacy of the victim’s home bathroom. Furthermore, the recording captured the entire naked body of the victim showering.

59     I therefore am of the view that the sentence can be calibrated to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

#### Sentence for the section 204 PC offence

60     Prosecution cited the unreported case of _Public Prosecutor v Ngien Wen Tseah Bertrand_ (“_Bertrand_”) as the facts therein closely resemble our present case. The offender was sentenced to 7 months’ imprisonment for the offence under s 204 of the PC. As the case was not reported, I set out the facts as presented by the prosecution which was gleaned from the Statement of Facts tendered in that case. The offender, a secondary school teacher, had entered the female toilet and placed three pin-hole cameras at each of the three cubicles inside the toilet. One of the cameras had recorded a video of the victim using the toilet. The offender walked past the operations manager’s office and noticed his cameras placed on the table. He realised that his cameras had been discovered and decided to get rid of the evidence. He waited for about one hour when no one was in the general office and removed the three micro-SD memory cards from the pin-hole cameras, leaving behind the three cameras on the desk. The operations manager realised that the SD-card was missing, checked the entry and exit records to his office, and discovered that the offender had accessed the office. When the offender was recalled back to school, and before the school could report him to the police, he discarded the SD-cards into a canal.

61     When he returned home, he also discarded an MOE-issued laptop down his rubbish chute as he had used the laptop to view the footages of earlier recordings of girls. He was charged with, inter alia, one count under s 509 of the Penal Code, one count under s 426 of the Penal Code, and one count under s 204 of the Penal Code. He was previously untraced, and he pleaded guilty to the charges. The offender was diagnosed with depression, underlying mixed personality problems and voyeuristic behaviour in the IMH report, and schizophrenia in the Singapore General Hospital report.

62     I found that the facts in the case are quite similar in that the offender had also noticed that his cameras had been discovered and waited for an opportunity to retrieve three micro-SD memory cards from his cameras to dispose of them. In addition he also discarded the laptop he had used to view the footages of earlier recordings.

63     However given that _Bertrand_ involved more SD memory cards as well as a laptop, there ought to be a calibration downwards to 4 months’ imprisonment.

#### The Global Sentence

64     The final issue is whether to order the sentences to run consecutively or concurrently, and if consecutive, whether there need to be any further calibration after performing a ‘last look’ at the overall sentence.

65     At this juncture, I wish to state that the Defence Counsel despite being invited to reply to Prosecution’s submission on the length of imprisonment terms for each offence, declined to do so, in order to protect his client’s interest in asking for a non-custodial sentence. He was only prepared to submit that the terms of imprisonment imposed by the Court should run concurrently and not consecutively on the ground that the offences arose from a single transaction.

66     On this issue of whether the court ought to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences of imprisonment, the High Court in the case of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (_Mohamed Shouffee_) at \[31\] had held that

> “the real basis of the one-transaction rule is the unity of the violated interest that underlies the various offences. Where multiple offences are found to be proximate as a matter of fact but violate different legally protected interests, then they would not, at least as a general rule, be regarded as forming a single transaction”.

67     Here, clearly, there was a violation of different legally protected interests and the two offences were also committed in the course of different transactions. First, the offence under section 377BB(6) PC is clearly a completely dissimilar offence from the section 204 PC offence in that one involves the protection of privacy and modesty of a person whilst the other protects the preservation of electronic record as evidence to be produced in court.

68     Secondly, although the two offences occurred in the Gym, they clearly did not occur at the same time nor at the same location. They took place about 5 hours apart and occurred at different locations within the Gym. Furthermore, whilst the two offences are relatively proximate in time and space , one did not inevitably flow from the other. The Accused could have just stop at the first offence. Instead, he chose to commit the second offence of destroying the electronic record in order to escape the consequences of the first offence.

69     Having found that the two offences are not part of one transaction and are unrelated, each should attract its own criminal sanction (see _PP v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span>, at \[41\]). A multiple offender who commits unrelated offences should be separately punished for each offence and this is to be achieved by imposing consecutive sentences.

70     Finally, the totality principle need to be considered in the sentencing process. As elaborated in _Mohamed Shouffee_ (at \[47\] and \[58\]), this is a principle of limitation and a manifestation of the requirement for proportionality. The Court is to apply this principle at the end of the sentencing process by taking a last look at the facts and circumstances to assess whether the sentence looked wrong. If so, the Court can re-calibrate the individual sentences to arrive at an appropriate global sentence.

71     I have earlier indicated the length of each individual sentence and also that in principle, both sentences should run consecutively. The aggregate sentence would therefore be 7 months’ imprisonment. I then considered this would be the Accused’s first offence and that he did make some effort to get some treatment. I also considered that although the two offences are distinct, they are connected. The Accused is also a relatively young person and will be serving time in prison for the first time in his life. I decided to calibrate the sentence downwards slightly by reducing the sentence for section 377BB(6) by one month to 2 months’ imprisonment, giving a global sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment.

## CONCLUSION

72     I found that applicable sentencing principle in the present case to be predominantly that of deterrence, both general and specific. There are no exceptional circumstances nor did the Accused manage to demonstrate an extremely strong propensity for reform. The Accused was also not suffering from any mental disorder of a kind that could possibly satisfy the criteria for the imposition of an MTO.

73     I had therefore found probation and MTO to be inappropriate. Accordingly, custodial sentences have been meted out.
