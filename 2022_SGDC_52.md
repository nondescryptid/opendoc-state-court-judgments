9 March 2022

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## Introduction

1       The Accused was convicted after trial on the charge of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) punishable under s 67(2)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed){“RTA”). He has appealed against conviction and sentence.

## The charge

2       The charge against the Accused was –

> “…, on 26 March 2020, at about 1.10 a.m., along Marine Parade Road, Singapore, while driving the motorcar bearing registration number SGH 711 G, did have so much alcohol in your body that the proportion of it in your blood, _to wit_, not less than 174 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, exceeded the prescribed limit of 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)(“RTA”),

> And further, that you, before the commission of the said offence, were on 13 November 2014 in State Court No. 21, _vide_ DAC 925125/14, convicted of two offences of driving a vehicle when the proportion of alcohol in body exceeds the prescribed limit under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA, which convictions have not been set aside to date, and you are therefore liable to be punished with enhanced punishment under s 67(1) read with s 67(2)(b) of the RTA”.

3       DPP Lim Shin Hui and Huo Jiongrui conducted the prosecution. The Accused was represented by Mr Kanagavijayan Nadarajan.

## The trial

### The prosecution’s case

4       On 26 March 2020, at about 1.10 am, the Accused was driving his car (registration numbers SGH 711 G) along Marine Parade Road in the direction of Bedok South Avenue 1. when he was stopped at a police roadblock along the aforementioned road. SSgt Lum Wangyan (“SSgt Lum”) who was one of the officers on duty at the roadblock, then instructed the Accused to step out of the car. SSgt Lum noticed that the Accused smelt of alcohol. His face was flushed face and his eyes were bloodshot. His gait was unsteady. His speech was slurred. SSgt Lum asked the Accused if he had consumed alcohol. The Accused replied that he had consumed three cans of beer earlier. SSgt Lum conducted a breathalyser test on the Accused. The Accused failed the test. SSgt Lum placed him under arrest after he had acknowledged the test result[^1].

5       Due to the COVID-19 situation at the time, SSgt Lum also asked the Accused whether he had any travel history in the past 14 days. When the Accused replied that he did not, SSgt Lum handed him over to the escorting officers to escort the Accused to Bedok Police Division Headquarters (“G Division”). SSgt Mohammad Fadil Bin Jamil (“SSgt Fadil”) was one of the escorting officers. He had observed that the Accused had unsteady gait, had slurred speech and smelt of alcohol[^2].

6       At G Division, the Accused was brought to the lock-up external holding area. At about 2.30 am, Sgt Kweh Jun Qi Justin (“Sgt Kweh”) attended to him at the holding area. Sgt Kweh asked the Accused whether he had any recent travel history in the past 14 days. Sgt Kweh said that the Accused replied that he had travelled on 15 March 2020. As there was a standing instruction that accused persons with recent travel history were to be referred to Tanglin Police Division Headquarters (“E Division”) immediately to avoid intermingling with other accused persons in the lock-up area. This was to avoid possible contamination[^3]. As such no breath test was administered on the Accused at G Division. The Accused was instead referred to E Division. Before the Accused was escorted to E Division, SSgt Fadil served the Accused the NP 306 form which contained the requisite warning and the medical consent form (Exhibit P2). The Accused appended his signature to confirm his consent to provide a specimen of his blood for analysis[^4].

7       According to Investigation Officer (“IO”) Yus Mastari I Khazali (“IO Yus”), as the Accused had a recent travel history, he was referred to E Division for a blood test to be administered instead of a breath test. This was to avoid contamination of the breath analysing device. That was the reason why no breath test was conducted on the Accused.

8       On 26 March 2020, the nurse on duty at E Division was P Gayathiri (“Gayathiri”). She was the nurse with the Healthway Mobile Group (“HMG”). HMG was contracted to procure blood samples from subjects who, _inter alia_, were suspected of having committed a drink driving offence. Upon being alerted that the Accused was to provide his blood specimen for analysis, she activated the doctor on call, Dr Joel Soon Jia Yi (“Dr Soon”). After that, she filled up the blood specimen submission form (Exhibit P6) based on the information contained in Exhibit P2. These included the Accused’s name and NRIC numbers, the police report numbers, the IO’s name and the date and time the blood sample. She had written down the information on the form. Then she prepared the materials for Dr Soon to procure the Accused’s blood. These included a needle, a syringe, a blood tube, a cotton bud and a plaster[^5]. The Accused’s blood sample would be deposited and stored in the blood tube. Gayathri testified that she had also written down the Accused’s name and identity card number on the blood tube[^6].

9       At about 5.10 am on 26 March 2020, the Accused was brought into the nurse’s room at E Division for his blood sample to be taken[^7]. He was attended to by Dr Soon. Gayathri was also present in the room. Dr Soon testified that he had verified the Accused’s name and identity card number. He then interviewed the Accused followed by a medical examination. He documented the interview and examination in Exhibit P2[^8]. Dr Soon then procured his blood sample. First, he connected a new needle to a new syringe. He then cleaned the intended venepuncture site with sterile water or saline. He then performed the venepuncture and drew the Accused’s blood. The blood specimen was then transferred to the blood tube by piercing the needle connected to the syringe directly through the bung of the blood tube, whereupon the blood in the syringe then flowed into the blood tube. The syringe with the needle connected to it was then disconnected from the blood tube and discarded. The blood tube containing the blood specimen was already labelled with the Accused’s name and NRIC numbers. Dr Soon then appended his signature on two government seals. These were seals which had small perforations on them. He pasted one seal onto the blood tube and the cap of the blood tube[^9]. Dr Soon explained that this was done to seal the blood tube and prevent tampering. He then pasted the other government seal on Exhibit P6[^10].

10     The blood tube containing the Accused’s blood specimen and Exhibit P6 were then placed inside a ziplock bag[^11], while Exhibit P2 was stapled to the ziplock bag. Dr Soon then placed the ziplock bag into his own bag. After that he attended to the other suspects.

11     Subsequently Dr Soon contacted the courier company, namely Innovative Diagnostic (“ID”) which was assigned by HMG to collect, _inter alia_, the ziplock bag containing the Accused’s blood specimen and Exhibits P2 and P6, for despatch to the HMG office at the Police Cantonment Complex (“PCC”). The courier collected the ziplock bag from Dr Soon and brought them back to ID’s office[^12]. The next day, another courier then brought the same, together with other blood samples, to the HMG office at the PCC. There they were handed over to Lin Simin Jessie (“Jessie Lin”), a HMG administrator who was stationed there.

12     Jessie Lin confirmed that she had received a bag containing various ziplock bags, including the ziplock bag containing the Accused’s blood sample, from the courier on 30 March 2020 at the PCC[^13]. She checked and confirmed that all the ziplock bags had not been tampered with. She then opened up the ziplock bags and checked their contents, including the ziplock bag containing the Accused’s blood sample. The checks included[^14] -

> (a)     Ensuring that the name and NRIC numbers on the blood tubes containing the blood samples matched the particulars on Exhibits P2 and P6 inside the ziplock bag.

> (b)     Ensuring that the seals on the blood tubes containing the blood samples were intact.

13     After she was satisfied that everything was in order, in relation to the Accused’s blood sample, she wrote down “Dr Joel” and the date “30.03.20” on a form titled “PIC Blood Transfer to HMG Office @ Police Cantonment Complex Form” (Exhibit P9 at page 7) after confirming that the Accused’s blood sample had been procured by Dr Soon. She then manually keyed in the Accused’s particulars into her computer system using the information written in Exhibit P2 as reference. Jessie Lin admitted that, in doing so, she had made a typographical error in relation to the Accused’s name. Specifically, she had typed the Accused’s name as “Mahaderan” instead of “Mahadevan”.

14     Thereafter, she printed out four stickers bearing the HMG logo and which contained the Accused’s particulars that she had typed in earlier. These four stickers contained the typographical error committed by Jessie Lin described earlier. However, the Accused’s NRIC numbers in the four stickers were correct. She pasted three of the four stickers each on the following[^15] -

> (a)     The blood tube containing the Accused’s blood sample.

> (b)     Exhibit P2.

> (c)     Exhibit P6.

15     After that, she placed the blood tube containing the Accused’s blood sample with Exhibits P2 and P6 in the ziplock bag and sealed it. She then placed the ziplock bag inside a fridge. On 1 April 2020, she took out the ziplock bag from the fridge, placed it into a cooler bag, together with other ziplock bags containing blood samples, and brought the cooler bag to the Health and Sciences Authority (“HSA”)[^16].

16     At HSA, Jessie Lin handed the bag over to Widodo Andreas (“Widodo”), an analyst with HSA’s Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. He tallied the name and identity card number on Exhibit P6 against those on the sticker found on the blood tube. He also confirmed that the seal on the tube was intact. He then sent the blood tube to storage pending analysis[^17].

17     Sometime later, Lee Chia Min (“Lee”), a senior laboratory officer with HSA took the tube containing the Accused’s blood sample to perform the basic drug analysis. Lee confirmed that the seal on the blood tube was intact. She broke the seal and drew an extract of blood from the tube for the analysis. She then returned the blood tube into storage[^18]. Subsequently, Nur Kamilah Binte Zulkiflee (“Kamilah”), s HSA laboratory officer, took the same blood tube from storage, and she performed an alcohol screening and quantification test on the blood[^19].

18     After these tests were completed, Dr Chew Chin Na Gina (“Dr Chew”), an analyst with HSA, reviewed the results of the tests. She checked and confirmed that the analyses were performed according to the test protocols. She then issued the HSA Certificate (Exhibit P3) in which she reported that the Accused’s blood sample was found to contain not less than 174 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.

19     At the close of the prosecution’s case, the defence rightly declined to make a submission of no case to answer. Having examined the evidence adduced at that stage, I was satisfied that there was a prima facie case for the Accused to answer. I called upon him to enter his defence. The standard allocution was administered to him. He understood the allocution and elected to give evidence.

### The defence’s case

20     The Accused testified that on the night of 25 March 2020, he was at home when he felt discomfort on his left eye. As the pain increased, he was unable to find any eye medication. He drank one 330 ml can of Tiger beer, with an alcohol content of 4%. At about 11.00 pm the same night, as he was unable to sleep, he had another can of the same Tiger beer. However, he did not finish the beer in the second can as he wanted to leave the house to purchase some medication for his eye. At about 12.30 am, he left his home and drove to a pharmacy which was about 150 metres away. But it was closed. So he drove another 300 to 400 metres to a petrol station. There, he bought some eye drops and Panadol. As he drove home, at about 1.00 am on 26 March 2020, he was stopped at the roadblock along Marine Parade Road.

21     At the roadblock, the Accused denied that SSgt Lum had asked him how much alcohol he had consumed. He testified that SSgt Lum had only asked if he had been drinking, to which he had replied yes. He did the breathalyzer test which he failed. He confirmed that SSgt Lum had asked if he had travelled in the last 14 days, and after referring to his calendar in his mobile phone, he said yes and that he had returned to Singapore on 15 March 2020. The Accused then said that he was taken to G Division. There he used the washroom. He was also asked about his travel history again. He gave the same response. He was then taken to E Division. There, a doctor from HMG had procured his blood sample. There was no dispute that the Accused had consented to give his blood sample and that a blood sample was procured from him. At about 12.00 pm the same day, he was released and was allowed to drive his car home. Finally, on 10 June 2020, the Accused was surprised when he was informed of his blood test result.

22     The defence raised two main arguments. The first argument was that the result of the analysis as recorded in P3 was wholly inconsistent with the rate of consumption of beer as asserted by the Accused, which was, one full 330 ml can of beer and one partly consumed 300 ml can of beer. In other words, the blood test result was an improbability. This could only mean that there was a reasonable doubt that the blood sample that was ultimately tested was the Accused’s blood sample, or that the Accused’s blood sample had been contaminated.

23     The second argument was related to the blood specimen that was procured from the Accused. The defence was that the Accused was not required to provide a specimen of his blood for a laboratory test instead of a breath test as prescribed in s 70(3)(a) of the RTA. The defence’s argument was that the condition/conditions that would trigger the requirement for a blood test in that provision was not satisfied.

### The issues

24     The key issues for determination were as follows –

> (a)     Whether the condition or conditions prescribed in s 70(3)(a) of the RTA which required the Accused to provide his blood sample, as opposed to a breath sample, was or were satisfied;

> (b)     Whether the blood sample that was analysed and found to contain 174 ml of alcohol in 100 ml of blood was the Accused’s blood sample.

### Analysis of the evidence

#### Was the Accused required to provide his blood sample?

25     When the Accused was stopped at the roadblock, he was subjected to a preliminary breath test. This breath test was administered pursuant to s 69(1) of the RTA, which was that the police officers manning the roadblock had reasonable cause to suspect that the Accused had consumed alcohol when he was driving his car. The evidence of the police officers clearly showed that they had reasonable cause to suspect that the Accused had consumed alcohol. There was no dispute that the Accused had taken the preliminary breath test and failed that, and consequently he was placed under arrest for suspected drink driving.

26     After his arrest, the Accused was required to provide either a specimen of his breath for a breath test, or a specimen of his blood for a laboratory test: see s 70(1)(a) and (b) of the RTA. The section clearly provided that the default position was that a breath specimen would be required. In this connection, the breath specimen would be procured using a device called the Breath Evidential Analyser (“BEA”).

27     The reason for the default position of requiring a breath specimen instead of a blood test was to save police resources. This was clear from the statement of the Minister for Home Affairs in his speech during the Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1996[^20]. The Minister had described the existing procedure of procuring a blood specimen for a blood test for cases of suspected drink driving as inefficient and manpower intensive. He therefore proposed the use of the BEA device to assess alcohol level, which he said was expected to save the Police about 1,500 manhours a year.

28     Under the section, a blood specimen would only be required, in lieu of a breath specimen, if one of three conditions was satisfied –

> (a)     when the police officer making the requirement has reasonable cause to believe that for medical reasons a specimen of breath could not be provided or should not be required;

> (b)     when the requirement was made, there was no BEA device of a type approved for a breath test under the section at the police station or at or near the place where the arrest was made, or it was for any other reason not practicable to conduct a breath test; or

> (c)     the police officer making the requirement has reasonable cause to suspect that the person required to provide the specimen was under the influence of a drug or an intoxicating substance.

29     In the present case, the prosecution submitted that the COVID-19 pandemic rendered it not practicable to conduct a breath test on the Accused: see s 70(3)(a)(ii). Because of the pandemic, there was a directive that all suspected drink driving suspects who had travelled overseas within the last 14 days prior to their arrests were to be conveyed to E Division. There, they would be required to provide their blood samples for testing. The centralisation of the location where this class of suspects were to be processed was to avoid contamination with other suspects and accused persons at the lockups of the other police land divisions. The requirement for a blood sample instead of a breath sample was to avoid contamination of the BEA device. The prosecution argued that therefore it was not practicable to conduct a breath test on the Accused, and therefore he was required to provide a sample of his blood instead for testing.

30     I agreed with the prosecution’s submission. Given the pervasiveness of the COVID-19 pandemic at the material time, it was reasonable that all drink driving suspects who had travelled overseas within the last 14 days should be dealt with in one police division. This to prevent them from intermingling with other arrested persons in lockups in other police divisions. And as COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection, if these suspects were still required to provide their breath specimens, there was the real danger that the BEA device would be contaminated. On this basis, I agreed that it was therefore not practicable to conduct a breath test. In my opinion, the phrase “_for any other reason not practicable to conduct a breath test_” was broad enough to cover this situation.

31     I noted that it was not the defence’s case that the danger of contamination of the BEA device did not satisfy the condition “_for any other reason not practicable to conduct a breath test_”. Rather, they attacked the omission by the prosecution to produce the written directive in court. The prosecution had relied on the oral testimonies of the relevant police officers as evidence that there was such a directive. In my view, the omission to produce the written directive was not significant or fatal to the prosecution’s case. I had considered the oral testimonies of the police officers who referred to this directive. I was satisfied that their testimonies were cogent and I accepted their evidence that there was such a directive, and that on that morning in question, they had acted pursuant to that directive. I was satisfied that the police officers who attested to the existence of the directive had not colluded and fabricated this part of their evidence. It was pertinent to note that the defence did not allege collusion or fabrication. On a related point, I agreed with the prosecution’s submission that, in any event, the lack of a written directive would not have affected the attending officer’s exercise of his discretion to require the Accused to provide a sample of his blood. This discretion was clearly provided for in s 70(3)(a).

32     For the above reasons, I found that the Accused was required to provide a specimen of his blood for testing on the material day pursuant to s 70(3)(a)(ii).

#### Was the blood sample that was tested the Accused’s blood specimen?

33     At the outset, it should be noted that the Accused did not dispute that a blood sample had been procured from him by Dr Soon. There was also no dispute that the Accused had consented to giving his blood sample. His main argument was that the blood sample that was analysed by HSA was not the Accused’s blood sample. The defence raised the possibility that the Accused’s blood sample had been mixed up with another; and that that other sample was analysed by HSA. The defence’s contention was premised on two arguments – one, it was improbable for the alcohol content in his blood to be 174 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood when compared to the low rate of consumption of alcohol by him that night, which was one full 330 ml can and one unfinished 330 ml can of beer. Two, Dr Soon had observed the Accused to be sober when his blood specimen was procured.

34     In this regard, the chain of evidence in relation to the Accused’s blood sample became important. I would have to examine the whole procurement process from start to end and determine whether there was a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the blood sample that was ultimately tested. I divided the chain of evidence into three broad stages –

> (a)     the blood procurement performed by Dr Soon at the Tanglin Police Division Headquarters (“the blood procurement process”);

> (b)     the movement of the blood tube containing the Accused’s blood specimen from the custody of Dr Soon to Jessie Lin at the HMG office located at PCC, and from Jessie Lin to HSA (“The movement of the blood tube”); and

> (c)     the analysis of the blood specimen at HSA (“the blood analysis”).

##### (1)   The blood procurement process

35     The process in relation to the procurement of the Accused’s blood sample were set out in detail in \[8\], \[9\] and \[10\]. As such I would not repeat the evidence again, save to highlight the details that were salient to my evaluation of the evidence. Gayathri, the nurse who was on duty on that morning, had testified that she had prepared the equipment that were needed to procure the Accused’s blood. In relation to the blood tube in which the blood specimen would be deposited into after it was procured from the Accused, Gayathri testified that she had written down the Accused’s name and identity card number on the blood tube. This was consistent with the evidence of Dr Soon, who had confirmed that the tube was “_…always labelled with the, uh, the person’s name as well as NRIC number_”, and that the labelling was sometimes done by him and sometimes done by the nurse who assisted him in the room[^21]. He also added that before he conducted the interview which was the precursor to the procurement of the blood, he had verified the Accused’s name and NRIC numbers with the Accused[^22] .

36     Dr Soon’s description of how he had procured the Accused’s blood were as follows [^23] - first, he cleaned the intended venepuncture site on the Accused’s arm with sterile water or sterile saline, taking care not to use an alcohol swab to prevent contamination with the blood sample. After he had procured the blood sample with the syringe, he had transferred the sample into the blood tube. He did this by piercing the needle of the syringe directly through the bung of the blood tube. He had also taken care that the bung was not cleaned with or came into contact with any swab or material containing alcohol. Again, this was to avoid contamination with the blood sample. After that he would plug the blood tube with a cap. He then appended his signature onto two government seals. One seal was pasted onto Exhibit P6. The other was pasted around the cap of the blood tube to prevent tampering. After that, Dr Soon placed the blood tube and Exhibit P6 into one ziplock bag. He kept possession of the ziplock bag until it was collected by a courier from ID. Dr Soon testified that he had contacted the courier to collect the ziplock bag between 26 March and 1 April, and that it was collected.

##### (2)   The movement of the blood tube”

37     Zulfadli Bin Mohamed Amin (“Zulfadli”) was the Senior Logistics Manager with ID. He explained that the HMG doctors would call ID to collect the blood samples that they had procured. His company’s couriers would collect these samples, which were stored in plastic ziplock bags, back to the ID office. The plastic bags were stored in the despatch room until the next day when they would then be couriered to the HMG office at PCC. The ziplock bag containing the Accused’s blood sample was handed over to Jessie Lin in this manner. Zulfadli explained that after the blood samples had been handed over, the HMG staff (in this case Jessie Lin) would then append her signature and affix the HMG company stamp on the blood transfer document (Exhibit P9). The signature and the stamp were the confirmation that the blood samples have been received by HMG. He referred to page 7 of exhibit P9, which he said recorded that the Accused’s blood sample was received by Jessie Lin from his company’s courier named Haziq (Muhammad Haziq Bin Adam) on 30 March 2020. Zulfadli also confirmed that his couriers’ responsibility was only to collect the plastic bags containing the blood samples from the doctors and then delivered them to the HMG office at PCC. They did not open up the plastic bags for any reason[^24].

38     Haziq, the courier who had despatched the blood samples, which included the Accused’s, to the HMG office at PCC on 30 March 2020, disclosed that he had worked for ID as a despatch rider from March to October 2020. During this period of time, he had only couriered blood samples from the ID office to the HMG office at PCC. He confirmed that he was not the one who had collected the Accused’s blood sample from Dr Soon. But he confirmed that he had delivered the Accused’s blood sample to Jessie Lin at the HMG office at PCC[^25]. He testified that he had collected the blood samples from the fridge located at level 5 of the ID office at Jalan Kilang Barat. He said these blood samples were in plastic bags. He confirmed that he knew that there were tubes inside these plastic bags as he could feel the tubes inside. He confirmed that he had not open any of the plastic bags. He also did not know how many tubes there were in each plastic bag. Haziq also pointed out that he had erroneously signed his name in the middle of the document at page 7 of Exhibit P9. He clarified that he should have signed his name at the bottom of the document in the “Part B” portion instead. He also pointed out that in reference to the date “8/4” that he had written next to his signature (which referred to 8 April 2020), he explained that the date referred to the date that he had signed Exhibit P9. He explained that the documents in P9 were normally given to him by his supervisor. He could not remember if the documents were given to him to sign on the same day that he had couriered the blood tubes to the HMG office, and that it was possible that the documents had been given to him on a different day to sign[^26].

39     The testimony of Jessie Lin in relation to her role in receiving the Accused’s blood tube and the steps she took prior to delivering the blood tube to HSA for analysis have already been set out in detail at \[12\] to \[16\]. I would only highlight the salient points of her testimony. First, she had received the bag containing the plastic ziplock bags that contained blood samples on 30 March 2020 at the HMG office at the PCC. The ziplock bag with the blood tube containing the Accused’s blood sample and Exhibit P6 were amongst them. She had ascertained that the Accused’s blood tube was intact and had not been tampered. She also confirmed that the blood sample had been collected from Dr Soon. She then wrote down the words “Dr Joel” on the document at page 7 of Exhibit P9[^27] which came with the ziplock bag. She also wrote down the date “30.03.20” on the form, which was the date she had received the said blood sample[^28].

40     After that, she had typed in the Accused’s particulars in the company’s system. In the course of doing so, she admitted that she had made the typographical error with the spelling of the Accused’s name. After that she had printed out the four sticker labels containing the Accused’s particulars which she had typed in earlier. She then pasted the labels on the blood tube and the two exhibits P2 and P6, that would accompany the blood tube to HSA. After that she put these three items inside the ziplock bag, sealed it and stored it inside the fridge. The next day, 1 April 2020, she delivered the Accused’s blood tube with other blood tubes inside a cooler bag to HSA[^29].

41     At HSA, she handed the contents in the cooler bag, which included the ziplock bag containing the Accused’s blood tube, laboratory form and exhibits P2 and P6, to the HSA staff[^30]. The HSA staff then tallied each blood tube with the laboratory form. Once everything checked out, the HSA staff then signed on the laboratory book to confirm that they had received the blood tubes.

42     Widodo Andreas (“Widodo”), an analyst with HSA, confirmed that he had received the Accused’s blood tube from Jessie Lin on 1 April 2020 at about 3.44 pm. Widodo testified that he had confirmed that the Accused’s name and identity card number on the label pasted on Exhibit P6 tallied with those on the label on the blood tube. He also checked and confirmed that the “Government of Singapore” seal that was pasted between the cap and the body of the blood tube was intact. He explained that this indicated that there was no tampering of the blood tube and its contents. After confirming that everything was in order, he put the blood samples into storage in the laboratory pending analysis[^31].

##### (3)   The blood analysis

43     Dr Chew Chin Na Gina (“Dr Chew”), a forensic scientist with HSA, confirmed that the Accused’s blood sample had been submitted to HSA for analysis on 1 April 2020 at 3.44 pm. She said that the Accused’s blood sample was first put through a screening test. This involved extracting two samples of the Accused’s blood measuring 0.1 ml each. According to Dr Chew, both samples gave a reading of 186 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood. The Accused’s blood sample was then put through a confirmation test. Dr Chew testified that the confirmation test gave a reading of 187 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood.

44     She explained why she had reported the value of 174 mg of ethanol per 100 ml of blood in Exhibit P3. This was because ethanol distribution followed a normal distribution curve. In this case, the peak of the normal distribution was 186 mg per 100 ml. It was HSA’s practice to report the value at the lower end of the normal distribution curve. This was about 6% lower than the peak. This gave the value of 174. In conclusion, she stated that she was 99.73% confident that the ethanol level in the Accused blood was 174 mg per 100 ml, or higher[^32].Dr Chew also highlighted that if there were signs that the seal on the blood tube had been tampered with, or if there was a leakage of the blood tube, test would still be conducted but she would write down in the report that the blood was unsealed. She did not make any such entry in Exhibit P3 because she had found that the blood tube was not tampered with and there was no sign of leakage.

45     Senior laboratory officer, Lee Chia Min (“Lee”) testified that she had conducted the confirmation test on the Accused’s blood sample. She had taken the blood tube containing the Accused’ s blood sample from the biosafety cabinet located inside the laboratory. She testified that the laboratory was only accessible to the laboratory staff with access cards. She confirmed that the seal on the blood tube was still intact. She then proceeded to break the seal, and with a clean disposable pipette, she siphoned one millilitre of the Accused’s blood from the blood tube. She then placed the extract in a new test tube. Shen then returned the blood tube in the biosafety cabinet. The test tube containing the extract of the Accused’s blood was then tested[^33]. And as Dr Chew had testified, the analysis showed that the Accused’s blood contained 187 mg of ethanol.

46     HSA laboratory officer, Nur Kamilah Binte Zulkiflee (“Kamilah”) confirmed that she had taken the Accused’s blood sample from the fridge in the laboratory to conduct the screening test. She confirmed Lee’s testimony that the laboratory could only be accessed by the laboratory staff. She then described how she had tested the Accused’s blood sample. She prepared two clean glass containers on which she had written down the numerals 5 and 6. These numerals represented sequence numbers which were generated by the system (Exhibit P7[^34]). Exhibit P7 was the sequence sheet. She then used a pipette to siphon samples of the Accused’s blood from the blood tube and transferred them into the glass containers ‘5’ and ‘6’. After that, she closed the openings of both glass containers with caps. She also explained that before she extracted the Accused’s blood sample, she had rinsed the pipette at least 10 times with distilled water to ensure that there was no contamination of the blood sample.

47     She then asked another laboratory officer to verify that the sequence numbers on the glass containers tallied with the sequence numbers in Exhibit P7. Once this was verified, Kamilah and her colleague appended their initials on Exhibit P7. Once that was done, Kamilah returned the blood tube in the fridge. She then placed the two glass containers inside the machine and the test was conducted. The machine generated two alcohol analysis reports[^35]. She confirmed that these two reports showed that the blood sample in glass container ‘5’ contained 186.5896 mg of ethanol and the blood sample in glass container ‘6’ contained 186.3977 mg of ethanol[^36].

##### (4)   Was the chain of evidence of the blood tube broken?

48     First, I found that the Accused’s blood sample had been properly procured. The evidence of Dr Soon and Gayathri were both cogent and consistent. There was no contamination of the blood sample from the time it was procured from the Accused to the time the sample was transferred into the blood tube. I was also satisfied that there had not been any mix-up during the transfer of the blood sample into the blood tube. Dr Soon had confirmed that he would always check the name and the identity card number on the blood tube before he transferred the blood sample into the tube. He maintained that he had done this in the Accused’s case[^37]. He also maintained that in procuring blood samples from suspects, he would never deal with more than one suspect at any one time. He said, “_So, every single PIC \[person-in-custody\], we take the blood. We transfer the blood properly, we label it first, we pack it into the plastic ziplock bag before the next PIC enters the room_”[^38].

49     The defence made much of Dr Soon’s agreement with the defence during cross-examination that there was always a chance or possibility of mistakes happening. In my mind this was obviously a general statement by the doctor, and a fairly obvious one at that. However, his evidence on the blood procurement process clearly showed that no mistake had been made in relation to the procurement of the Accused’s blood specimen. Dr Soon had verified the Accused’s name and NRIC numbers before his blood was procured. Dr Soon had also checked the name and NRIC numbers written on the blood tube before he transferred the Accused’s blood sample into the blood tube. Dr Soon confirmed that he had procured the Accused’s blood, transferred it into the blood tube, and packed the blood tube into the ziplock bag. He was also sure that he had placed the ziplock bag in his bag before the next suspect entered the room[^39]. Dr Soon informed that it was against company policy to pre-label the blood tubes and he confirmed that this was never done[^40]. Although Dr Soon had not transferred the blood sample into the blood tube in the Accused’s presence, I did not find this to be fatal. It did not detract from the fact that the blood sample had been properly procured and that it had been properly transferred into the correct blood tube labelled with the Accused’s name and NRIC numbers.

50     I was also satisfied that the Accused’s blood tube had been properly delivered to Jessie Lin on 30 March 2020, and in turn, she had delivered the same to HSA the next day on 1 April 2020. Jessie Lin had received the Accused’s blood tube on 30 March 2020. She had tallied the name and NRIC numbers written on the Accused’s blood tube against the information found in Exhibits P6 and P2. She had inspected the seal on the blood tube and confirmed that it was intact[^41]. After satisfying herself that the integrity of the exhibit had not been compromised, she had keyed the Accused’s name and NRIC numbers from Exhibit P2 into the system. In doing so, she had made a minor typographical error when she had typed in the Accused’s name as “Mahaderan” instead of “Mahadevan”[^42]. I did not consider this to be material. Looking at the Accused’s name in Exhibit P2 (which was handwritten), it was reasonable that Jessie Lin had mistaken the letter ‘v’ for the letter ‘r’. In any event, the Accused’s NRIC numbers was typed in correctly. Jessie Lin had also entered Dr Soon’s name and the Investigation Officer’s name in the system. She then printed out the four labels. She pasted one on the top of the first page of Exhibit P6, one on the blood tube containing the Accused’s blood sample, and the remaining two were pasted on a laboratory form and a laboratory book respectively. These would be presented to the staff at HSA when she sent the blood sample to HSA. The HSA staff would sign on these documents to confirm the receipt of the sample. After that, she then placed Exhibit P6, the blood tube and the laboratory form back into the ziplock bag and sealed it. They were then stored in the fridge in the office. On 1 April 2020, she took them out, put them into a cooler bag together with the other ziplock bags of samples, and conveyed them to HSA for analysis. Her evidence above were cogent and were not shaken during cross-examination. As such, I accepted her testimony.

51     Similarly, I accepted the testimonies of the three HSA personnel in relation to the receipt of the blood sample and its subsequent analysis. I found that the blood sample received at HSA was the Accused’s blood sample procured by Dr Soon. I also found that the analysis had been conducted properly and I accepted the test result as reported in Exhibit P3.

52     From the above evidence, the defence’s contention that the Accused’s blood sample had been mixed up with someone else’s could not stand. A such I would now look at whether the Accused’s blood sample had been tampered with before it was analysed at HSA.

53     In this regard, I noted that the courier who had collected the blood tube from Dr Soon was not called to give evidence. Therefore, arguably between the time the said courier took possession of the blood tube from Dr Soon to the time he had dropped it off at the ID office, the movement of the blood tube was unaccounted for. Therefore, it was possible that the blood tube had been tampered with during this period.

54     In addressing my mind to this issue, I was mindful that the prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the blood sample which was analysed by HSA was the blood sample that was drawn from the Accused: _Mohamed Affandi bin Rosli v PP and anor appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 1 SLR 440</span>. However, it was not necessary that the chain of custody of the blood sample must be proved by calling witnesses to testify to each and every step of the process. The guiding principle was whether there was a doubt as to the identity of the blood sample: _Satli bin Masot v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 931</span> at \[15\]. Doubt here referred to reasonable doubt. As the prosecution has rightly pointed out, it did not mean that speculative arguments about the possibility of contamination or mix-up of the blood samples would be entertained.

55     I found that there was a break in the chain of custody as the courier who had collected the blood sample from Dr Soon was not called to give evidence. However, having carefully analysed the evidence that had been adduced, I found that there was no reasonable doubt that the blood sample that was analysed by HSA was the same sample procured by Dr Soon from the Accused. Firstly, Jessie Lin had testified that she had checked the blood tube and confirmed that there was no tampering of the said blood tube. This meant that if there was tampering, then the perpetrator would not only have to have access to another blood tube, they would also have to use the same type of labels and government seals used by Dr Soon to label and seal the blood tube, in order to deceive Jessie Lin into believing that the blood tube had not been tampered with. Also, the perpetrator would have to specifically target the Accused’s blood tube out of all the blood tubes in the bag which was couriered to Jessie Lin. I was All these rendered the idea of tampering entirely improbable.

56     As regards to the defence’s submissions that the Accused did not display any overt signs of intoxication, which they argued gave credence to their case that the blood sample that was tested was not the Accused’s, I noted that both SSgt Lum and SSgt Fadil had testified that the Accused had displayed signs of intoxication at the time of his arrest. These observations were critical to their decision to conduct a breath test on him. In any event, I recognised that the actual level of alcohol tolerance might vary from individual to individual. Alcohol intoxication might affect the mental faculties and awareness of those intoxicated by it in different ways. This was the reason for Dr Soon’s comments on the unreliability of a clinical assessment to assess intoxication. He said that “_the sensitivity of clinical examination to pick up alcohol intoxication is poorer than that of a blood alcohol \[test\]_”, and that this was well documented in the medical literature. He added that one explanation for the lack of overt evidence of intoxication could be the fact that the person could have a history of chronic alcohol intake, in that, “a chronic alcohol intake may require ... higher level of BAC for them to display any overt evidence or overt clinical evidence of alcohol intoxication”[^43]. As such, the fact that Dr Soon had not observed any overt signs of intoxication was neutral.

57     Further, I should stress that the Accused’s claims about his rate of consumption of alcohol and the type of alcohol consumed that night in question was a bare assertion. He had not produced any independent evidence to support these claims. On the other hand, the objective evidence before me ie the blood test, showed unequivocally that he had 174 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.

58     I therefore found the Accused guilty of the charge and convicted him accordingly.

## Antecedents

59     The Accused has the following relevant antecedent –

## The sentence

### The prescribed punishment

60     The Accused was a second offender.

61     The prescribed punishment for a second or subsequent offence of drink driving was a fine of not less than $5,000 and not more than $20,000, and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. In addition, s 67(2) prescribed a disqualification order of five years for a repeat offender, unless there are special reasons not to make such an order.

### Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

62     DPP Lim sought a sentence of eight to nine weeks’ imprisonment and a fine between $11,000 to $12,000. She also sought that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for seven years. She cited _Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“_Edwin Suse_”) in support of her sentencing position. She also highlighted the following aggravating factors –

> (a)     The Accused’s alcohol level was substantially high;

> (b)     He had no good reason to drive;

> (c)     He had a similar previous drink driving conviction less than two years before he committed the present offence;

> (d)     He had not shown remorse.

### The mitigation plea

63     Mr Kanaga highlighted that the Accused had not posed any actual or potential danger. He was in control of the car as he had been able to drive the car along Marine Parade Road which was narrow and winding due to significant construction going-on at the material time. No accident and no damage was caused. He had extended his full co-operation, in that, he had complied with all instructions given by the police officers on the ground, furnished all details when requested, and readily consented to giving his blood sample. He had driven only because he needed to get to the pharmacy to purchase the eye medication and then return home. He had not gone on a frolic. The distance from his home to the roadblock was only 600 metres. Traffic was very light at the material time so there was no danger posed to other road users.

64     For the above reasons, Mr Kanaga submitted for a sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment and fine of $6,000. He also sought a disqualification order of not more than five years. In support, he cited the case of _PP v Pow Xun Ping_ (DAC-906237-2021).

### The sentence by the court

65     In determining the sentence in this case, the applicable sentencing framework was set out in _Edwin Suse_. The _Edwin Suse_ framework had been revised in the case of _Rafael Voltaire Alzate v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 224</span> (“_Rafael_”). This was to take into account the increased statutory penalties provided for under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA, which was applicable in this case. The revised framework was as follows (at \[31\] of the judgment) –

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="35.52%"> <col width="31.76%"> <col width="32.72%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Level of alcohol (µg per 100ml of breath)</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Range of fines</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">Range of disqualification</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36-54</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$2000-$4000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">24-30 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">55-69</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$4000-$6000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">30-36 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">70-89</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$6000-$8000</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">36-48 months</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">≥ 90</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">$8000-$10000</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">48-60 months (or longer)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

66     In application the sentencing framework, I bore in mind the observations of the Chief Justice in _Rafael_ (at \[33\]) -

> “…this framework provides only _neutral starting points_ based on the relative seriousness of the offence and considering _only_ the level of alcohol in the offender’s body. Regard should still be had to any aggravating or mitigating circumstances (see _Edwin Suse_ at \[22\]), and the former, if they exist, _could_ result in the custodial threshold being crossed.” (emphasis as in the original)

67     Some of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances described in _Edwin Suse_ (at \[27\] and \[28\]) were as follows –

> (a)     The actual or potential danger posed by the offender’s conduct in committing the offence. This could be manifested by the manner of driving: see _PP v Lee Meng Soon_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 240</span>. I should emphasise that one could not presume that an offender whose alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit had not been able to control his vehicle.

> (b)     Other circumstances that increased or heightened the danger to road users. An example would be where the offender had driven during rush hours when the volume of traffic was heavy. Or where the offender was driving a heavy vehicle that was more difficult to control and required a quicker reaction time.

> (c)     When the offender had only intended to drive for a very limited distance, this would constitute a mitigating factor: see _Cheong Wai Keong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 3 SLR(R) 570</span> (“_Cheong Wai Keong_”).

68     In determining the appropriate sentence, I applied the following two-step approach (_Edwin Suse_ at \[16\]) –

> (a)     The extent to which the concentration of alcohol in the offender’s blood or breath exceeded the prescribed limit;

> (b)     Whether there were any other aggravating or mitigating factors present in the case.

69     The alcohol level in this case was high. 174 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood would correspond to at least 76 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of breath. This figure was arrived at by dividing 174 by 80 (the prescribed limit for blood), and then multiplying the result by 35 (the prescribed limit for breath). 76 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of breath placed the case squarely into the third band in the table at \[69\]. An offender with a higher alcohol concentration was in more flagrant violation of the law and was therefore deserving of more serious punishment: see _Ong Beng Soon v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1992\] 1 SLR(R) 453</span> (at \[7\]). In this case, the blood alcohol level was twice the prescribed limit.

70     On the aggravating and mitigating factors, I noted that the aggravating factors set out in \[70(a)\] and \[70(b)\] were wholly absent. However, the absence of an aggravating factor did not amount to a mitigation factor. This was noted by the court in _Edwin Suse_ (at \[24\] of the judgment) –

> “\[t\]he fact that an offender had not displayed poor control of his vehicle or had not caused an accident resulting in property damage or injury is plainly relevant in deciding whether the seriousness of the offence had been _aggravated_; but the obverse proposition, that the absence of such an aggravating factor may be called in aid as a mitigating factor, is misconceived and simply does not follow.”

> (emphasis as in the original)

71     I should also have due regard for the Accused’s motivation or reason for driving as that might have an impact on his culpability. In this case, I agreed with the DPP’s submissions that the Accused had absolutely no good reason to drive. His reason for driving did not qualify as an emergency or as an extenuating circumstance that would reduce his culpability. It could not compare to the scenarios described in Edwin Suse (at \[33\] of the judgment) –

> (a)     The offender had driven out of impulse when he received a call from his friend who had told him that she was contemplating committing suicide with her children: _Sivakumar s/o Rajoo v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 265</span>;

> (b)     The offender had driven in a state of panic and anxiety when she received a call from the hospital informing her that a close relative was in a critical condition: _Lim Kay Han Irene v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 240</span>.

72     Next, I was of the view that the mitigating factor set out in \[70(c)\] above was not applicable to the Accused. In _Cheong Wai Keong_, the court accepted the fact that the offender had only driven for a short distance in order to get his vehicle to a car park when he realised that he had parked his vehicle along double yellow lines as a mitigating factor. In _PP v Ng Poh Tiong_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGDC 233</span>, the court accepted the fact that the offender had driven his car a distance of two feet into another parking lot as a mitigating factor. The Accused’s circumstances were wholly distinguishable. There was no intention by the Accused to drive for a very short distance only. He had first driven to a Guardian pharmacy which was about 150 metres away from his house. When he realised that it was closed, he then drove to a petrol kiosk which was about 300 to 400 metres away from the pharmacy[^44].

73     Rather, I found that his decision to drive was a grave and blatant disregard of the prohibition against driving under the influence of drink because he had in 2014 been convicted for the offence of drink driving. He was therefore fully aware of the seriousness of driving whilst under the influence of drink, and yet he made the conscious decision to do so. In addition, he had re-offended less than two years after his driving ban had been lifted in May 2018. This rendered his decision to drive more egregious.

74     I also noted that the Accused had not shown contrition for the offence. His defence at the trial was based on a series of speculations and unfounded allegations, including the serious allegation that Jessie Lin had tampered with the Accused’s blood sample. I also noted that the defence’s closing submissions contained numerous submissions based on points which had not been put to the prosecution witnesses.

75     In my view, the starting point should be four to five weeks imprisonment and a fine of $10,000. This was on the basis of the Accused’s high blood alcohol level alone. Given the other factors discussed above (at \[75\] and \[76\]), an uplift of four weeks from the starting point was warranted. For the same reasons, I was of the view that there should also an uplift from the minimum mandatory disqualification period prescribed. As for the fine quantum, I was of the view that no uplift in the fine quantum was warranted.

## Conclusion

76     All considered, I sentenced the Accused to eight weeks’ imprisonment and fine of $10,000 in default two weeks’ imprisonment. I also disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of seven years. The disqualification order was to take effect from the date of his release from prison.

77     The Accused has lodged an appeal against conviction and sentence. He is on bail pending appeal. The execution of the sentences of imprisonment, fine and the disqualification order are stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.
