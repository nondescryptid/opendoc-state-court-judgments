### District Judge Teoh Ai Lin:

1       The accused Ragu s/o Andiappan age 46 years was released from prison on 7 March 2020 subject to a remission order, where he had been serving sentence for a drug offence. He was emplaced on the mandatory aftercare scheme and required to reside at Selarang Halfway House (“Selarang”). Not long thereafter he committed his first offence at Selarang and subsequently absconded, committing a total of 16 offences from 12 April 2020 until his arrest on 3 August 2020.

2       The accused pleaded guilty to seven charges with another nine charges taken into consideration. I sentenced him to a total of two years, seven months and 583 days’ imprisonment, and an enhanced sentence of 294 days. He has appealed against the sentence and is currently serving sentence.

## The Charges

### Overview of the offences

3       The accused committed two series of offences. The first offence of causing hurt to a fellow resident at Selarang was committed on 12 April 2020, and then on 26 May 2020 he absconded and breached his mandatory aftercare conditions (“MAC”). He then committed another nine offences until his first arrest on 17 July 2020.

4       After he was released on personal bond, he did not return to Selarang and continued to breach his curfew.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) He then went on to commit another five offences until his second arrest on 3 August 2020.

5       The seven proceeded charges were for theft of bicycles, housebreaking, possession of drugs and drug utensils, causing hurt, and breach of MAC. Six of these related to offences committed before his first arrest on 17 July 2020 and the seventh related to an offence committed after his first arrest.

6       After he absconded he stole bicycles on 14 and 15 July 2020, and was in possession of methamphetamine and drug utensils when he was first arrested on 17 July 2020. The housebreaking in order to steal a bicycle was committed on 27 July 2020 after his release on personal bond.

### Nine charges taken into consideration

7       The nine charges taken into consideration related to offences committed before and after his first arrest.

8       They comprised four theft of bicycle committed between 10 July 2020 and 3 August 2020, and one charge each for possession of property reasonably suspected to be stolen on 17 July 2020, possession of diamorphine on 17 July 2020, wilful trespass on 28 July 2020, failing to surrender to custody on 30 July 2020, and possession of a survival knife with a 9.5cm long blade being an offensive weapon on 3 August 2020.

## Material Facts

10     The material facts relating to his offences are set out below in chronological order.

##### Fact relating to the 10th charge (“Hurt charge”)

11     The victim is Mohd Khairulesyam Abdullah @ Thangavel Muthukumaran, a male Singaporean. At the time of the offence, he was 44 years old and a resident at Selarang Halfway House (“SHWH”), located at 1825 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore. The witness is one Gobi, a male Singaporean. He was a resident at SHWH at the time of the offence.

12     On 12 April 2020 at about 9.55pm, around the main gate of SHWH, the victim was having a smoke break with the witness. The accused, who was intoxicated and reeked of alcohol, walked past the victim towards the main gate of SHWH. When the victim did not greet the accused by saying “hi”, the accused got angry and confronted the victim. The victim replied, asking why he needed to say hi to the accused. The accused then pushed the victim and the victim pushed the accused back. As the accused was clearly drunk, the victim then asked the accused to go back to SHWH. The accused then threw a punch at the victim, which landed on the left side of his forehead. This caused the victim to fall to the ground. The victim began bleeding above his eyebrow. The witness ran away and requested assistance from SHWH security.

13     The victim was conveyed to Changi General Hospital for medical attention and was seen at the hospital Accident & Emergency Department on 12 April 2020 at about 11.08pm. He lied to his examining doctor about the cause of his injury, stating that he had taken a fall, as he did not want to get into trouble.

14     According to the medical report dated 28 April 2020 by Dr Kant Abhay, the victim sustained a 4cm laceration over his left eyebrow and a 4cm laceration over his left parietal scalp. He had to have stitches and was given medical leave until 16 April 2020. A facial bones X-ray also showed a cortical irregularity over the victim’s nasal bone, suggesting a possibility of minimally displaced fracture, but the existence of the fracture could not be confirmed. The victim was referred to the ear-nose-throat (otorhinolaryngology) specialist for follow-up, but did not attend the appointment.

15     By punching the victim on his forehead, intending to cause him hurt and thereby causing him to sustain a 4cm laceration over his left eyebrow and a 4cm laceration over his left parietal scalp, the accused has committed an offence punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

16     From 7 March 2020 to 5 September 2022, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed), which remission order was subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the said Act. He committed the aforesaid offence while the remission order was in effect. Upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the said Act, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, and he is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the said Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 877 days from 12 April 2020 to 5 September 2022.

##### Facts relating to the 4th charge (“section 50Y charge”)

17     The complainant is one Goh Kim Pok. He is the Operations Manager of Selarang Halfway House located at 1825 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore 506780 (“SHWH”).

18     The accused was released from Prison on 7 March 2020. He was subjected to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under section 50I of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2000 Rev Ed) (“Prisons Act”) from 7 March 2020 to 5 September 2022 (both dates inclusive). The accused was concurrently placed on the MAS from 7 March 2020 to 6 March 2022, and subjected to mandatory aftercare conditions under section 50V(3) of the Prisons Act.

19     The mandatory aftercare conditions which were set out in the remission order and which the accused was required to comply with included, amongst others, the following:

> A.1 You must, unless admitted to hospital, reside in a halfway house at 1825 Upper Changi Road North, Singapore 506780 for the period as required by the Commissioner of Prisons….

> B.1 You must remain indoors between 2200 hours and 0600 hours every day of the week at the said halfway house or specified place or your place of residence the day of the week and timing of which may be adjusted from time to time by your supervision officer(s) or by the Manager of the halfway house as the case may be.

20     The remission order also specified that a failure to remain indoors, when required to do so under the remission order or at a time and day specified by supervision officer(s) or the manager of the halfway house, for a cumulative period of 24 hours, would constitute a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition.

21     The accused signed his remission Order on 7 Mar 2020, acknowledging that its contents had been fully explained to and understood by him.

23     On 26 May 2020 as of 9pm, the accused had failed to return to SHWH and wilfully remained out of SHWH for a cumulative period of 29 hours. On 26 May 2020 at 9.07pm, the complainant lodged a police report stating that the accused had committed a serious breach of a mandatory aftercare condition by failing to remain indoors at SHWH for a cumulative period of more than 24 hours.

However, he failed to return to SHWH and continue to breach his curfew further. As such, on 20 July 2020 at 9.55am, a second police report was lodged against the accused for failing to return to SHWH and wilfully remaining away from SHWH for a cumulative period of 24 hours or more. The accused had remained uncontactable and at large. On 3 August 2020 at 12.50pm, the accused was arrested by the Police at Block 185A Woodlands Street 13, Singapore.

He is thereby liable to be punished with a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding the remaining duration of his remission order of 833 days from 26 May 2020 to 5 September 2022, pursuant to section 50Y(1)(a) of the Prisons Act.

##### Facts relating to the 5th charge (Theft charge)

27     The victim is Melvin Meow Yan Loong, a male Singaporean. He resided at Blk 101 Woodlands Street 13 #XXX, Singapore. On 12 July 2020 at about 4pm, the victim had parked his white Polygon bicycle along the common corridor outside his unit. The bicycle was left unlocked. The victim did not park the bicycle in his house because it was dirty as he had just returned from trekking.

29     The Police subsequently identified the accused as the person who had stolen the victim’s bicycle. POLCAM footage showed the accused carrying the victim’s bicycle down the staircase to the ground floor of the victim’s block on 14 July 2020 at about 5.36am, and cycling it away thereafter.

30     The victim had purchased his bicycle from a seller on Carousell for S$800. The Police subsequently recovered the bicycle from the possession of the accused.

On 20 July 2020, the victim discovered that his bicycle had gone missing. At about 6.29pm, he called the Police stating that his bicycle had been stolen from 185B Woodlands St 13, Singapore.

33     The victim had purchased the bicycle from his friend for $1,000. The Police managed to identify the accused through POLCAM footage. The footage showed the accused using a bolt cutter to cut the locks on the victim’s bicycle on 15 July 2020 at about 6.27am at the bicycle bay of Blk 185B Woodlands Street 13, Singapore. The accused then wheeled the bicycle away at about 6.30am. The Police subsequently recovered the victim’s bicycle on 17 July 2020 from the possession of the accused.

34     By dishonestly taking the victim’s bicycle out of the victim’s possession without his consent, the accused committed an offence punishable under s 379 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

He committed the aforesaid offence while the remission order was in effect. Upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the said Act, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, and he is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the said Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 783 days from 15 July 2020 to 5 September 2022.

##### Facts relating to the 11th charge (DAC-902628-2021) (“Drug possession charge") and 13th charge (DAC-902630-2021) (“Drug utensils charge”)

36     On 17 July 2020 at about 10.30pm, the accused was arrested by Police Officers from Woodlands Division for drug- and property-related offences, in the vicinity of Block 185A Woodlands Street 13, Singapore 731185. A search was conducted on the accused and the following items were found in his mobile phone case:

> (a)     One packet containing crystalline substance (“RA-A1”)

> (b)     One aluminium foil with burnt marks, and one cut straw (“RA-B”)

37     The exhibit marked “RA-A1” was sealed in a tamper-proof bag and submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis on 21 July 2020. On 7 August 2020, Maria Devianna Avisena Lieka, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate under section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”), bearing laboratory number ID-2032-01178-001, stating that the exhibit marked “RA-A1” was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.24 gram of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain not less than 0.16 gram of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

38     The accused admitted to owning the exhibit marked “RA-A1”, which was a packet of “ice” (the street name for methamphetamine) intended for his own consumption. The accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have in his possession a controlled drug and he thereby committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA.

39     Before the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 30 November 2012, in District Court 3, vide DAC 19551/2012, convicted of an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA and punished under section 33(1) of the MDA with 30 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside, and he is therefore liable for enhanced punishment under section 33(1) of the MDA.

40     The accused admitted to the possession and ownership of the exhibit marked “RA-B”. He had intended to use the aluminium foil to consume “heroin” (a street name for diamorphine) and intended to use the cut straw to scoop “ice” into a glass pipe for consumption. The accused was not authorised under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder to have in his possession utensils to be used for the consumption of a controlled drug.

41     He thereby committed an offence under section 9 and punishable under section 33(1) of the MDA.

42     From 7 March 2020 to 5 September 2022, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed), which remission order was subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the said Act. He committed the aforesaid offence while the remission order was in effect. Upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the said Act, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, and he is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the said Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 781 days from 17 July 2020 to 5 September 2022 for the two above offences.

2020 at 10.30pm.

##### Facts relating to 1st charge (DAC-915149-2020) (“Housebreaking”)

43     The victim is Madsen Crystal Lynn, a female American citizen. At the time of the offence, she was 39 years old and resided at 6 Woodgrove Walk, Singapore. On 26 July 2020 at 8pm, the victim last saw her light blue “Pivot” brand mountain bicycle with orange handlebars and full suspension, intact at the front porch of her house. On 28 July 2020 at 4.00 p.m., the victim discovered that her bicycle was missing. She then called for police assistance.

44     The Police subsequently identified the accused as the culprit based on POLCAM footage. The accused admitted to having trespassed into the victim’s property, either by climbing into the unit or entering through the unlocked gate, and stealing the bicycle. The Police subsequently recovered the bicycle from the possession of the accused on 3 August 2020.5. The bicycle had a market value of $8,000, but the victim had purchased it from her friend (who was leaving the country) for around $4,000.

45     By entering the premises of 6 Woodgrove Walk to commit theft of the bicycle on around 27 July 2020, the accused committed an offence punishable under section 451 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

46     From 7 March 2020 to 5 September 2022, the accused was subject to a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons under Division 2 of Part VB of the Prisons Act (Cap 247, 2014 Rev Ed), which remission order was subject to the basic condition under section 50S(1) of the said Act. He committed the aforesaid offence while the remission order was in effect. Upon conviction and the imposition of a sentence reflected under section 50S(1)(b) of the said Act, the accused shall be deemed to have breached the basic condition of his remission order, and he is thereby liable to be punished under section 50T(1)(a) of the said Act with an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the remaining duration of the remission order of 771 days from 27 July 2020 to 5 September 2022

## Overview of parties’ submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

47     Prosecution submitted for a global sentence of two years, nine months and 877 days imprisonment and a fine of $5000, by running the three sentences for housebreaking, section 50(Y)(1)(a) Prisons Act (“section 50Y”) and drug possession consecutively [\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) :

### Defence submissions

48     Counsel submitted that the individual sentences proposed by Prosecution were reasonable, and asked only for lower sentences for the house-breaking and theft offences.

49     He did not disagree with Prosecution’s submission for three sentences to run consecutively but submitted not to run the three heaviest sentences consecutively[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3). He agreed that the sentences for drug possession and section 50(Y) should be run consecutively but asked that the sentence for one theft offence, rather than the housebreaking offence, be run consecutively. He also submitted for no section 50T enhanced sentence to be imposed. This would make a global sentence of two years 6 months and 583 days imprisonment.[^4]

## Sentencing Considerations for section 50Y and section 50T offences

50     As the court in _Abdul Mutalib bin Azman v PP & other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 102</span> (“_Abdul Mutalib_”) guided, where both section 50Y(1)(a) and section 50T(1)(a) Prisons Act offences are involved, the court should determine the imprisonment sentences for the section 50(Y) offences first, before considering in the round from the most serious to the least serious of the fresh offences whether to impose any enhanced sentences under section 50(T) for the fresh offences. The remaining duration of the remission order at the time of the offender’s earliest offence operates as the outer limit to the cumulative sentence that may be imposed under section 50T and section 50(Y): at \[53\], \[76\] and \[87(c)\].

51     In the present case, the outer limit of the cumulative sentence that may be imposed under section 50T and section 50Y was 877 days, which was the remaining duration of the accused’s remission order at the time he committed his earliest offence of causing hurt on 12 April 2020.

52     I will therefore first deal with the appropriate sentences for the section 50Y offence, and the sentence for the most serious of the fresh offences, which was the Drug possession charge.

## Section 50Y charge (4th charge)

53     In determining the appropriate sentence for section 50Y, _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[87(a)\] stated that in the first step the gravity of the fresh\\section 50Y offence committed by the offender, the offender’s rehabilitative prospects and all other relevant circumstances should be considered, and then in the second step, the appropriate sentencing band the case falls under should be determined.

54     Prosecution submitted that the offence fell within the mid-range of the High band and submitted for 70% of the remaining term to be remitted, that is, 583 days. Counsel did not make any contrary submissions, and the global sentence he submitted for included the 583 days sought by Prosecution for the section 50Y offence.

### Assessment of severity

55     In assessing the gravity of a serious breach of a MAC, the type of breach, the duration of breach, consequences of breach and motivations behind the breach are relevant: _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[56\].

56     In _PP v Amanshah bin Omar_ (MA 9790)(“_Amanshah_”) the accused had been released from prison for theft and drug offences. He breached his curfew just after two months from his release from prison for a total of 279 hours and 25 minutes (about 11.6 days) and eventually surrendered himself for drug-related offences. He pleaded guilty to four charges – theft, section 50Y, LT-2 drug consumption and enhanced drug possession, with another three drug-related charges taken into consideration.

57     The court considered his breach to be “relatively grave” given the duration which was considered a substantial period of time: at \[120\]. Further his rehabilitative prospects were not optimistic as he had demonstrated a lack of commitment and re-integration, as the breach occurred some two months after his release from prison and he did not respond to repeated attempts urging him to return. The severity of his offence was placed at the higher end of Band 2, and 60% of his remaining remission term was remitted.

58     In this case, relative to the spectrum of breaches of MAC, the failure to remain indoors at his place of residence was one of the more serious of the serious breaches. As regards duration of breach, the accused had been absent for 1654 hours (nearly 68.9 days) until his second arrest on 3 August 2020.

59     As regards his motivations for breach, no explanation was offered as regards the breach. However the accused went on to commit another 14 offences in the 10-week period after he breached his curfew until his second arrest on 3 August 2020. He had told IMH[\[note: 5\]](#Ftn_5) that he was hanging out with his friends at their home when he realized 3 days had passed. He was aware he had breached the curfew and did not return as he would go back to prison if he returned.

60     As for his rehabilitative prospects, I agreed with Prosecution that they were low.[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6) The factors to be considered included the timing of the section 50Y offence and the offender’s commitment to rehabilitation and re-integration. The accused breached his curfew on 26 May 2020, less than three months after his release from prison. He had also demonstrated little commitment to rehabilitation and re-integration. Numerous attempts had been made to contact the accused by calling and texting him between 25 May and 26 May 2020 about his breach and to return to Selarang, but the accused did not respond.[^7]

61     Notably after absconding the accused was undeterred by and unremorseful after his first arrest on 17 July 2020. After his discharge from hospital and release on personal bond, he did not return to Selarang. He not only continued to breach his curfew, but went on to commit another five offences. He had demonstrated his flagrant disregard for the MAC and his rehabilitative prospects were low.

62     Finally as regards “all other relevant circumstances” where the court is to have regard to the specific aggravating and mitigating factors, there was little by way of mitigation. As regards the guilty plea, the court in _Abdul Mutalib_ noted that a guilty plea would carry little weight where the offender has been caught red-handed and given that section 50Y offences concern breaches of monitoring conditions, it was difficult to envisage a situation where an offender would not be caught red-handed: at \[65\]. In this case I accorded some mitigating weight to the accused’s early plea of guilt as it had saved the court’s time and resources.

### Severity of offence at the lower end of Band 3

63     All things considered, I would place the accused’s section 50Y offence at the lower end of Band 3 as his breach was more egregious compared to the offender in _Amanshah_, where the court had placed the breach at the higher end of band 2 and remitted 60%. I agreed with Prosecution that he had committed a relatively grave breach[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8)\- the duration of breach was far more substantial than _Amanshah_, nearly 6 times (68.9 days to 11.6 days). He had absconded less than three months after he was emplaced on the mandatory aftercare scheme and ignored calls and texts to return to Selarang, and he committed offences before and after his first arrest. He had amply demonstrated his lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration and poor prospects for rehabilitation.

64     I agreed with Prosecution that a 70% remission of his remaining 833 days was appropriate, and imposed a sentence of 583 days for the section 50Y offence.

## Drug possession and section 50T charge (11th charge)

65     The accused faced one charge for possession of methamphetamine on 17 July 2020. As he was previously convicted for drug possession on 30 Nov 2012 and sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment, the accused was liable for an enhanced punishment of a minimum of two years imprisonment under section 33(1) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed). This was the most serious of the fresh offences that he had committed.

66     Prosecution submitted for the mandatory minimum sentence to be imposed in view of his plea of guilt and the small quantity of methamphetamine involved (0.24 gram of crystalline substance found to contain not less than 0.16 gram of methamphetamine). Counsel did not make any submission on sentence for this offence.

67     I noted that this was the accused’s third drug possession charge (1995 and 2012), and there was another drug possession charge taken into consideration (possession of diamorphine on 17 July 2020). Deterrence in particular specific deterrence would be the operative consideration. However I balanced this against his guilty plea which saved the court’s time and resources, and the small amount of the drugs involved.

68     I was of the view that the mandatory minimum of two years’ imprisonment was appropriate punishment and would adequately serve the need for specific deterrence.

### Section 50T enhanced sentence should be imposed

69     Prosecution submitted that while this case was at the borders of Band 2 and Band 3 of _Abdul Mutalib_ and an enhanced sentence of 520 days (that is, 2/3 of the remaining remission period of 781 days) was appropriate. However this was subject to the limiting principle that the cumulative offence imposed for the section 50Y and section 50T offences should not exceed the 877 days remaining at the time of his earliest offence on 12 April 2020. Therefore the remaining balance of his remission of 294 days should be imposed (that is 877 days less 583 days for the section 50Y offence).

70     In Mitigation Counsel did not say why a section 50T sentence should not be imposed. In court he asked the court not to fully remit the remainder of the accused’s remission term.

71     The court in _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[51\] had guided that although enhanced sentences under section 50T were discretionary, as long as the fresh offence committed is more than _de minimis_, this would suffice in general to justify the imposition of an enhanced sentence. The question of whether an enhanced sentence should be imposed and how long the sentence should be may be assessed in the round.

72     The court further stated at \[63\] that although the offender’s lack of commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration was not expressly provided as a relevant consideration in section 50T(3), this can be considered under “all other relevant circumstances”, although the court should ensure that identical considerations are not applied multiple times. The court at \[66\] and \[67\] also stated that once the relevant aggravating or mitigating factors had been considered in arriving at the underlying sentence for a fresh offence, these factors should not be reconsidered separately in determining the enhanced sentence.

73     In this case, the Drug possession charge was by no mean _de minimis_ and an enhanced section 50T sentence should on principle be imposed.

### Assessment of Severity

74     As regards the gravity of the fresh offence in this case, the offence was a serious one being a repeat offence which attracted the imposition of a minimum sentence of two years jail. I considered it as one of moderate severity.

75     As regards the accused’s rehabilitative prospects, he had committed this offence on 17 July 2020, which was only slightly more than four months after his release from prison, which was not a substantial period of time.

76     As for similarity between the fresh offence and his original offence, the court in _Abdul Mutalib_ at \[60\] held that offences are considered similar if they share common legal elements or commonalities “in the broad sense understood by laymen”. The present offence was drug-related, although not identical to the offence for which he had been convicted in 2015 for failing to provide a specimen for urine test for which he had been sentenced to seven years six months jail and 6 strokes of the cane.

77     Apart from his consistent offending as seen from his series of offences after he absconded from Selarang, of relevance also would be his string of drug-related antecedents which dated back to 1995. He had previous drug-related convictions in 1995, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2015 for a myriad of drug offences comprising drug possession, drug consumption, failure to report for urine test and failure to provide urine specimen. Despite having received substantial LT1 (in 2000) and LT2 (in 2015) sentences (five years six months and seven years six months respectively with mandatory caning in both instances) the accused does not appear to have been rehabilitated or deterred from drug offences.

78     I was of the view that the accused’s rehabilitative prospects were dim and he was lacking in commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration.

### Offence of moderate severity above mid-point of Band 2

79     I considered the severity of the accused’s enhanced drug consumption offence to be of moderate severity and would place it above the mid-point of Band 2.

80     The appropriate enhanced sentence would be at least 50% of the remaining remission of 781 days, that is, 390.5 days. However as there was an outer limit of 877 days for the cumulative section 50Y and section 50T sentences, I sentenced the accused to the remaining 294 days (that is, 877 days less the sentence of 583 days for the section 50Y offence).

## Sentences for the remaining offences

81     I will now deal with the sentences for the remaining five offences in the order of the commission of the offences. No enhanced sentences were imposed for these remaining offences, as the outer limit of 877 days had been fully remitted.

## Hurt offence

82     Prosecution submitted that based on the _PP v Low Song Chye_ \[2019\] 5SLR 526 (“_Low Song Chye_”) this was a low harm\\Band 1 case and urged the court to impose a maximum fine of $5000. This was because the accused committed this offence shortly after his release from prison, he had instigated the offence and the victim’s injury was not negligible as he suffered two lacerations.

83     Counsel in his Mitigation submitted for a fine of $3000 to $4000 and a short default sentence of one week. However in court Counsel asked the court to impose a short custodial sentence of one week as the accused could not pay a fine.

### Low Song Chye sentencing framework

84     The High Court in _Low Song Chye_ prescribed three broad sentencing bands with indicative sentencing ranges based on the level of hurt caused in the offence for first-time offenders who pleaded guilty: at \[77\] and \[78\]. The court is to undertake a two-step inquiry:

> (a)     First, to derive the appropriate indicative starting point, the court is to identify the applicable sentencing band and where the offence falls within the indicative sentencing range by considering the hurt caused, having regard to the relative severity of the hurt sustained compared to the other forms of hurt within that sentencing band and the relevant sentencing precedents: \[80\], \[83\] and \[88\].

> (b)     Second, the court is to make the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on its assessment of the of the offender’s culpability as well as all other relevant factors, including the aggravating and mitigating factors identified in _PP v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“_BDB_”), which may take the eventual sentence out of the applicable indicative sentencing range.

### Application to the facts

85     The victim suffered two 4cm lacerations – one over his eyebrow and the other over his left parietal scalp. According to the medical report, his injuries required stitching and he was given medical leave until 16 April 2020[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) (that is, four days medical leave).

86     I agreed with Prosecution that this was a Band 1 low harm case. However in my view the harm suffered by the victim was not low-level Band 1 minor injuries as the injuries required stitching and the accused was given four days medical leave. I would place the harm caused as bordering the custodial threshold in Band 1.

87     As for culpability, I noted that the accused was not only the instigator in the incident, he was also the first to resort to physical means in the altercation. He got angry when the victim did not greet him at the gate of SHWH and confronted the victim verbally why he did not do so. When the victim replied why did he have to say “hi” to the accused, the accused responded physically by pushing the victim who pushed him back, before the accused eventually punched the victim.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

88     This was not a fleeting single-punch incident, as it had been preceded by the accused first pushing the victim. According to the statement of facts, after the mutual pushing, the victim had told the accused to go back to SHWH which was some indication that the victim wanted to dis-engage but the accused then proceeded to punch the victim on his forehead.

89     There were also aggravating factors present. First, the accused had punched the victim’s forehead, a vulnerable part of the body. Second the accused was intoxicated and reeking of alcohol at the time of the incident.

90     In my view the forgoing matters brought the offence well into the custodial range of Band 1, which carried an indicative sentencing range of up to four weeks’ jail under the _Low Song Chye_ framework, which was based on the pre-2020 maximum punishment of two years’ imprisonment. In this case the accused committed the offence in April 2020 and the maximum punishment is now three years’ imprisonment.

91     As the _Low Song Chye_ framework applied to plead-guilty cases there would be no further discount on account of his guilty plea. The accused had no previous similar antecedents, which was a neutral factor. However I took the accused’s early plea of guilt as some evidence of his remorse and gave it some mitigating value. This did not take the offence out of the custodial range.

92     All things considered I was of the view that a sentence of ten days’ imprisonment would be appropriate and imposed it accordingly.

## Charges for Theft of bicycle (5th and 6th charges) and Housebreaking (1st charge)

93     I will discuss these charges together as they are property-related offences and the relevant offender-specific aggravating factors are similar.

### Parties’ submissions on sentence

94     The theft offence carried a maximum sentence of three years’ imprisonment. Prosecution submitted for a sentence of eight months’ jail per charge. The accused was traced for property offences dating back to 1994, and last sentenced to six months’ jail in 2010 for theft. In his current spate of offences he stole seven bicycles between 10 July and 3 August 2020, cumulatively worth several thousand dollars and three bicycles had been stolen in the same day 15 July 2020 (6th, 14th and 15th charges).

95     Counsel submitted for a sentence of six months’ jail per charge. The accused had stolen the bicycles to use them and not for financial benefit, and his theft antecedents were dated.

96     As for the housebreaking charge, the maximum prescribed sentence was ten years’ imprisonment.

97     Prosecution submitted for nine months jail. There were no aggravating factors such as premeditation or abuse of trust and the value of the item stolen was not high, although the accused had numerous property-related antecedents.

98     Counsel submitted for a sentence of eight months’ jail. He referred to _PP v Rita Kanitha d\\o Narayanan_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 151</span> (“_Rita Kanitha_”) where the court observed from the unreported decisions that the indicative starting sentencing range to be between five to 15 months jail. There were little aggravating factors and the stolen bicycle was recovered.

### Offence-specific factors for the Theft charges

99     There were minimal offence-specific aggravating factors. However unlike the 5th charge where the bicycle had been left unlocked on the common corridor and the accused had carried it away with him[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11), in the 6th charge the accused had used a bolt cutter to cut the locks on the victim’s bicycle. The victim in the 6th charge had taken some pains to secure his bicycle – he had secured both wheels with a U-shaped lock to a fixed structure and also locked the rear wheel with a chain lock and used a long chain lock with a metal padlock to secure both wheels.[^12] Not only did the accused’s cutting of the locks cause damage, that he had with him a bolt cutter suggested that there was some premeditation on his part.

100    The items stolen could not be considered to be of insubstantial value. The bicycles stolen in the 5th and 6th charges were valued at $800 and $1000 respectively, while the bicycles in the charges taken into consideration were valued at $1000 to $1300 with some of them of unknown value.

### Offence-specific factors for the Housebreaking charge

101    As the court in _Rita Kanitha_ at \[23\] observed, the current section 451 took effect from 1 January 2020 and no longer distinguished between house trespass, housebreaking, whether the housebreaking\\lurking was committed at night or in order to commit theft or otherwise.

102    In this case, the bicycle stolen was of substantial value. It had a market value of $8000 and had been purchased by the victim for $4000 from a friend who was leaving the country.

### Offender-specific aggravating factors relevant to both the Theft and Housebreaking offences

103    As for offender-specific factors, there were numerous property-related charges to be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing. These included four other theft of bicycle charges (7th, 8th, 14th and 15th charges), which were committed both before and after his first arrest on 17 July 2020, and one charge for being in possession of a bicycle reasonably suspected of being stolen (9th charge).

104    Additionally, the accused had also committed wilful trespass (17th charge) into a second residential premise on 28 July 2020 at 61 Woodgrove Walk in the vicinity of and not long after the commission of the Housebreaking offence.

105    As for his antecedents, the accused was traced for property-related offences in 1990, 2004 and 2010. In 2010, _all four_ of his convictions were property-related offences. He was convicted for theft and attempted theft and sentenced to six months and four months jail respectively, running concurrently. Prosecution was not able to furnish further details of his 2010 theft convictions. In addition, he was also convicted for being in fraudulent possession of property and sentenced to six months jail, and for being armed with house-breaking implements (with another identical charge taken into consideration) for which he received a sentence of six months’ jail.[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) In total he received a global jail sentence of twelve months’ jail for these property-related offences.

106    Although the 2010 property-related offences appear dated, I observed from his CRO record that he had been incarcerated for substantial periods of time for drug offences after his 2010 convictions. He had been convicted in November 2012 for drug-related offences for which he received a total of 36 months’ jail, and then again in December 2015 for a drug offence for which he received a sentence of seven years and six months’ jail and six strokes of the cane. He then committed the first of this spate of bicycle thefts on 10 July 2020 (7th charge) only some four months after his latest release from prison, and his property-related antecedents continued to be relevant in sentencing.

### Appropriate sentences to be imposed

107    The accused’s guilty plea carried limited mitigating weight as he had been identified from Polcam footage, but I considered that the guilty plea saved the court’s time and resources.

108    That the bicycles were recovered was a neutral factor and did not carry mitigating value, as was the submission that the accused committed the crimes to use the bicycles and not for any personal gain.

109    As the court in _PP v Low Qi Jing_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 174</span> (“_Low Qi Jing_”) guided at \[62\] and \[74\], an escalation of sentences may be warranted where the offender’s antecedents disclose “a cavalier disregard for the law…. Where the offender’s prior criminality “demonstrate(s) that the current offence is no passing lapse, but evidence of a real unwillingness …to comply with the law”. However while specific deterrence may justify a stiffer sentence this cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence, otherwise the offender would in effect be punished a second time for his prior offence.

110    The accused’s last two sentences for theft in 2010 was six months’ and four months’ jail running concurrently, and he has remained undeterred. His numerous bicycle-related offences (six theft, one possession of bicycle suspected to be stolen and one housebreaking) in this present spate of offending were committed within the short space of just three weeks (10 July 2020 until his second arrest on 3 August 2020) and pointed to escalating frequency of offending. Moreover while the theft offences in the 5th and 6th charges prior to his first arrest involved stealing bicycles in publicly accessible areas like common corridors and bicycle bays, the Housebreaking offence committed 10 days after the release from his first arrest on 17 July 2020 was an escalation of his thievery which had progressed into trespassing into a gated private residence to steal a bicycle. Also his unabated theft and other offences after his first arrest not only demonstrated a lack of remorse but also reinforced his recalcitrance.

111    All things considered and considering the need for specific deterrence tempered by proportionality, I was of a view that a deterrent sentence of seven months’ imprisonment per theft charge was appropriate and imposed it accordingly.

112    As for the Housebreaking charge, this was a more serious offence. Prosecution had cited three section 451 cases: _PP v Muhammad Is Bin Alias_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 180</span> (“_Muhammad Is_”), _Rita Kanitha and PP v Chan Lue Min_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 244</span> (“_Chan Lue Min_”). These three cases showed that the courts have imposed sentences of between 10 to 19 months’ imprisonment for housebreaking offences.

113    However the factual matrix of the offending in all these three cases were vastly different from the present case, and these offenders had exhibited a high degree of culpability.

114     _Muhammad Is_ involved two accused persons looking for opportunities to steal in the early morning hours. In one offence they pried open the door of a salon using a screwdriver and stole items worth $2258, and in another they used a screwdriver to pry open the padlock securing the door of a “Best” store and stole items worth $2586. _Rita Kantha_ involved a former clinic assistant who broke into the clinic by unlocking the digital number lock to steal cough mixture she was addicted to and she added water to the remaining cough mixture to avoid detection. The accused in _Chan Lue Min_ was an employee of Best Denki who assisted in setting up a booth for his employer at an IT fair. Prior to the IT fair he asked a co-accused if he was interested in stealing from the Best Denki booth and they made plans to steal from the booth, and to facilitate this the accused took photos of the door and possible entry points when he set up the booth. The co-accused climbed over the booth wall and opened the door for the accused and they stole goods valued at $35,640.

115    In all these three cases there was premeditation and planning involved. _Rita Kantha_ and _Chan Lue Min_ also involved employees who had abused their position and trust, while the offenders in _Muhammad Is_ had caused damage to gain entry into the premises. Further the value of the items stolen in _Chan Lue Min_ was more than four times that in the present case.

116    The accused’s offence was absent any of these features, although this had to be balanced against the numerous offender-specific aggravating factors and the need for specific deterrence. In the circumstances the Prosecution’s submission for a nine-month sentence was a fair one, and I imposed it accordingly.

## Drug utensils offence (13th charge)

117    The offence carried a maximum sentence of three years’ imprisonment. Prosecution noted that the courts typically impose sentences of three to nine months for such offences. Prosecution said it would leave the sentence for this offence to the court and submitted for it to run concurrently. Counsel did not make any submissions on sentence for this charge.

118    The accused admitted that he intended to use the aluminium foil and the cut straw for his drug consumption activities.[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14) In 2012 he had been convicted of an identical offence and was sentenced to six months’ jail.

119    As this was not his first offence for possession of drug utensils, a sentence at the lower end of the usual tariff was inappropriate. Although specific deterrence was relevant, the accused was also facing the more serious enhanced drug possession charge with a minimum sentence of two years and deterrence could be achieved by running the enhanced drug consumption charge consecutively. The accused had pleaded guilty and although he had been caught red-handed, his guilty plea had saved the court’s time and resources. I was of the view that six months imprisonment would be a sufficient punishment and imposed it accordingly.

## Conclusion

120    The sentences imposed for the seven proceeded charges are summarised below:

121    All seven proceeded charges involved the invasion of distinct legally protected interests, although the drug possession charge and the drug utensils charge were drug-related and occurred in the same transaction. I ordered three sentences to run consecutively - the sentences for the section 50Y, drug consumption and theft offences- which would appropriately reflect the overall criminality of the accused and sufficient to address the need for specific deterrence.

122    Counsel submitted in Mitigation that the global sentence sought by Prosecution by running three of the heaviest sentences consecutively and for full remission was unduly heavy and crushing, and there would be no dilution of the retributive and deterrent effect if the global sentence of two years six months and 583 days he was seeking for the accused was imposed.

123    As _Abdul Mutalib_ stated at \[83\] and \[86\], the first limb of the totality principle has a limited role to play in the sentencing process because the legislative regime has built within it safeguards and constraints which embed proportionality into the sentencing framework.

124    The second limb of the totality principle will operate in the last stage of sentencing process where the court takes a “last look” to determine whether the aggregate sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospects. In this regard the court should take into account the sentence for the fresh offences, and any enhanced sentences under section 50T and section 50Y, and good and cogent reasons for any adjustments made at this stage should be articulated.

125    In this case, the accused’s remaining remission period was fully remitted by the section 50Y and attenuated section 50T sentences. However this did not mean that the sentence was a crushing one. In _Amanshah_, the accused’s remaining period of remission of 861 days had also been fully remitted. All the facts and circumstances of the offending including the offender-specific factors had to be considered on a case by case basis. I also did not run the three heaviest sentences as Prosecution had urged. All things considered when I took a last look at all the facts and circumstances of the case, I did not consider the total sentence to be crushing and not in keeping with the accused’s past record and future prospects so as to require adjustments. I therefore sentenced the accused to a global sentence of two years, seven months and 583 days’ imprisonment, and an enhanced sentence of 294 days.
