\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9095/2019/01-02.\]

4 February 2020

### District Judge Eugene Teo Weng Kuan:

J was 17 years old when she finally came forward to tell her mother that she had been molested by a family uncle some years earlier.[^1] She said the incidents took place at their home when she was 13 to 14 years old; the accused uncle was staying at their home then. The family agonised, and ultimately reported the matter to the Police. Investigations led to 6 Charges being brought against the Accused uncle – despite the latter’s subsequent denials and protestations of innocence. The trial was before me, and after assessing the evidence, I found J to have been an utterly credible witness, and that all 6 Charges had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt; the Accused was accordingly found guilty and convicted. These are the grounds for my decision.

## BACKGROUND:

2       The following points form the background to this case:

> ■    The Accused first came to Singapore to work (from Malaysia) sometime in 2000. Whilst here, the Accused became close to J’s parents; he was J’s paternal uncle.[^2] Sometime in 2002-2003, he started boarding intermittently with J’s family. At that time, J’s family was then staying in a two bedroom HDB flat at Depot Road. J’s parents took the master bedroom, while the Accused shared the other bedroom with J and her elder brother. J was then about 7 years old.

> ■    In the middle of 2003, J’s family shifted to another HDB flat in the same area; this flat had three bedrooms. The Accused then moved in to stay with them on a more permanent basis. The new sleeping arrangements saw J’s parents taking the master bedroom, the Accused and J’s elder brother (who was then aged 10) taking another bedroom, and J taking the last bedroom on her own. J was then 8 years old, and the Accused was then 30 years old.

> ■    J and her family then got along well with the Accused. The Accused was working here as a technician. J’s father was working as a delivery driver, and J’s mother was working variously as a hairdresser and as an office tea lady.

> ■    J said the first incident took place about 5 years later when she was 13 years old. It was the lead up to her Secondary Two streaming exams in September 2009. J said the Accused would come into her bedroom at night and do things to her. Five incidents took place in the night during that period. A few months later in January 2010, the 6th incident took place during the day while she was taking a nap. J said she was afraid, did not know what to do, and she just pretended to be asleep. J said she continued to act normally during the day as she did not know how to process those actions of the Accused against her, and she also did not want to worry her parents by telling them what happened.

> ■    The Accused moved out a few months later in October 2010.

> ■    J raised the complaint in June 2013, and that led to police investigations.

> ■    During the investigations, the Accused entered a partial admission in his long statement. He later retracted this and denied all of J’s allegations when his cautioned statements were recorded. In court, he said his long statement ought to be disregarded because the first IO was biased against him. He also surmised that J had concocted these allegations because she had become inappropriately fond of him, and was angry when she saw that his attention and affections had shifted to his new girlfriend instead.[^3] In support of this, the Accused highlighted the messages which J sent to him and her behaviour towards him during and after the period of the alleged offences. The Accused also cast doubt on the coherence of J’s allegations, that they could not have taken place in the manner she described, and that she could not have felt those sensations she described, because he actually suffered from extreme palmar hyperhidrosis (sweaty palms) during that period.

## ISSUES:

3       Against that background, the disputed issues in this case were all factual in nature. The Prosecution’s Case on the incidents rested entirely upon the testimony of J herself. Her evidence therefore had to be “unusually convincing”: _PP v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ \[2008\]1 SLR(R) 601 at \[37\] to \[38\]; _XP v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 4 SLR(R) 686</span> at \[31\]; & _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> at \[111\]. This court had to determine whether J’s testimony against the Accused met that standard. I start by first setting out the evidence offered up both sides.

## EVIDENCE:

## PW1: J - Complainant

4       Born in 1995, J was 20 years old when she testified before me. Petite and neatly turned out, J was comfortably conversant in English and she opted to testify without an interpreter.

#### \-   Relationship with the Accused:

5       J said she was still in Primary School when the Accused moved in to stay with them. She described how the Accused became a much-loved uncle; one who would spend time with her, read storybooks to her, help in homework, becoming like “another parent” to her.[^4] At that age, J said she trusted him a lot and that she became very close to him. Occupying that role in her eyes, J readily admitted that she was also physically affectionate with him at that age, i.e. with hugs and kisses on the cheek/forehead, and with him welcoming it and doing the same to her. Her parents did not mind it, but when she grew older and went through puberty with the physical development of her breasts, her mother warned her that she should not allow herself to be touched inappropriately. J said her mother did this when the Accused was hugging J a bit too much, and putting his hands around J’s chest.[^5] J said she did not however heed her mother’s warning and just continued as before.

#### \-   Events during the material period:

6       Turning to the incidents, J said that they were clear in her mind as they took place during an intense period which she was then going through. She explained that the incidents started just before her Secondary 2 streaming examinations, and that she was studying very hard during that period as she wanted to do well so that she could enter the triple-science stream.[^6] She was then 13 years old, and she had her own bedroom.

7       J said that her parents had an open door policy for all the bedrooms at night. A nightlight was left on in the corridor outside the bedrooms. The first incident took place sometime in September 2009. J said that she had gone to bed for the night in her normal sleep attire: a loose t-shirt, a cloth bra, shorts and panties. She described herself as a heavy sleeper during that period who could even sleep through thunder.[^7] Sometime in the middle of that night though, she woke when she felt someone’s hand in her shorts and inside her panties rubbing her vagina skin on skin.[^8] J said she was shocked, confused, and that she froze up in fear. She continued to keep her eyes closed and pretended to still be sleeping, explaining that she was afraid of confronting the person directly. The person continued touching her even after she pretended to sleep toss and turn. J then just waited in fear for the person to finish. Although she felt pain and soreness at her vagina, she did not know what to do.[^9] J later added that the person also moved up her bra to expose her breasts and then touched her breasts and rubbed her nipples.[^10] The incident lasted for what felt like 15 minutes before the person put her clothes back on and left the room.[^11] At that point, J turned and saw from the ambient light that it was the Accused who was walking out. J could recognise from the size and height that it was the Accused as he was much taller than her father or her brother.[^12] She cried, and ultimately went back to sleep. The next day, she pretended as if nothing happened as she thought it was just a one-off thing.[^13] J also said that she did not want to worry her parents by telling them.[^14] This incident formed the subject matter of the first Charge in DAC 922680/2015.

8       The second incident took place about a week later.[^15] J said that she woke in the middle of the night to find the Accused again rubbing her vagina. This time, she found that her shorts and panties had been pulled down to her mid-thighs. She said he also slipped his hand under her shirt, moved her bra up to expose her breasts, and rubbed her nipples. After a while, he proceeded to lick her vagina and her anus, before also licking her nipples.[^16] J could feel his breath on her skin as he did so, and that it was a wet sensation ‘unlike the touch of his finger which was dry’.[^17] J said that she again froze in fear and did not know what to do.[^18] J said this second incident lasted longer than the first, and that after he was done, he put her clothes back on and walked out. As he did so, J again looked and saw that it was the Accused.[^19] The next day, J kept it to herself and pretended – like her uncle – that everything was normal.[^20] This incident formed the subject matter of the second Charge in DAC 922681/2015.

9       Over the next few nights, J said the third and fourth incidents took place in similar circumstances. J said she was a heavy sleeper during that period as she was exhausted from the hard work she had been putting in for her exams.[^21] J described how she woke in the middle of the night to find the Accused doing the same acts on her during these two further incidents.[^22] This formed the subject matter of the third Charge in DAC 922682/2015, and the fourth Charge in DAC 922683/2015.

10     A few nights later, the fifth incident took place in similar circumstances. J described the Accused again doing the same acts on her. In addition, J said this time the Accused also pulled her out to the edge of the bed and she could feel something smooth rubbing gently at her vagina; it was unlike his finger or tongue. J said she tried to pretend sleep toss and turn, but the Accused later still pulled her out towards the edge of the bed again.[^23] She then again felt the same smooth object rubbing gently against her vagina. After a while, the Accused gently lifted her left hand and placed it around his penis and started to make her hand rub it up and down in a masturbation motion.[^24] J did not initially know that the object at her vagina was his penis, but she could tell what it was now after the Accused moved her hand there. She described that it felt ‘warm, hard and erect, with veins on it, and was shaped like a sausage’ in her hand.[^25] The masturbation motion lasted just a while “about 5 seconds” before he put her clothes back and proceeded to the common toilet just outside her room. After a while, she heard the toilet bowl being flushed. J said the Accused then came back into her bedroom, kissed her on her left cheek, and whispered that he loved her, before leaving.[^26] As before, she looked and saw that it was the Accused; and this time, she could also recognise his voice as he whispered those words to her.[^27] This incident formed the subject matter of the fifth Charge in DAC 922684/2015.

11     A few nights later, J said she woke up upon hearing her mother’s voice.[^28] She heard her mother saying ‘_what are you doing here?_’. J then realised that the Accused was behind her at the bedside and she felt the Accused take his hand out from her shorts before replying ‘_Nothing, just checking if she \[J\] is asleep_’. J said that she did not feel any touches by the Accused yet. The Accused then pretended like nothing happened, and just left her bedroom. J said she did not get up and just continued to pretend she was asleep.[^29] After being ‘caught’ like that, J said that the Accused stopped coming in the night again. During the day, she then continued to pretend that nothing bad had happened and that everything was normal.

12     More than 3 months later in January 2010, J had progressed to Secondary 3 and was now 14 years old. J said that the Accused was in her room one Saturday afternoon helping her with her Chinese schoolwork.[^30] After working on the assignment for a while, J said she became very tired and wanted to take a nap. She thought the Accused would not do anything since it was daytime, and also because her mother was then around in the flat. She nonetheless decided to lie face down with her head towards the door. After some time, she felt the Accused move the middle of her shorts and panties to the right side before going on to rub her vagina back and forth repeatedly. J said the Accused also stroked the side of her left breast – which was exposed and accessible at the side because of the singlet that she was wearing. Just like before, J froze up again and did not know what to do. J said she ‘felt very lost, very confused, shocked and frustrated’ that the Accused was now doing this in broad daylight.[^31] J said the incident lasted for what felt like 10-15 minutes. This incident formed the subject matter of the sixth Charge in DAC 916216/2016.

13     About 9 months later, the Accused moved out after buying his own property in Johor Bahru.[^32] Contact then became infrequent.

14     J thereafter went on to complete Secondary 3, Secondary 4, and entered a Junior College.[^33] When she was in JC One, she suffered a breakdown while at school. J said that she had been experiencing recurrent flashbacks and nightmares for some time about what the Accused had done to her. She had tried all that time to cope by just pretending that her life could just go on. However, on that occasion, the flashback of him touching her made her very uneasy and scared, and she started crying. She said her self-esteem was very low; and that she felt she had been used to please his sexual needs, like a ‘prostitute’.[^34] She then decided to tell her parents because she could pretend no more. She typed out a message on her phone’s notes application, and when she got home later, J told her mother she had something to tell her, and showed that typed note to her mother. J’s mother was shocked and angry. J’s father was subsequently informed when he returned home later; and J said he was also angry and heartbroken.[^35] The family agonised on what to do, and called the police for information. The next day, on 20 June 2013, J’s parents accompanied her to report the matter to the Police (Police Report was admitted and marked as Exhibit **P2**). Family relations with the Accused and the other family members linked to the Accused thereafter became strained, and contact was cut off.[^36]

15     Learned Counsel mounted a vigorous and thorough cross-examination. Whilst some in-roads were made (which I will detail later), J’s core account remained unshaken. J also denied that her allegations were false, and refuted the suggestion that she was making them up because she was angry at the Accused.

## PW2: Mdm SLK – J’s Mother

16     Mdm SLK testified in simple English. She said J was very young when the Accused came to stay at their home. When asked what kind of relationship J had with the Accused, Mdm SLK answered simply: ‘uncle and niece relationship’.[^37] After a few more warm up questions, Mdm SLK said she had ever seen the Accused hugging J at the shoulders. When the DPP asked if she had seen the Accused touch J anywhere else, Mdm SLK said no, but that she would not know if he did so behind her back. She next confirmed the sleeping arrangements at the home, and that there was an open door policy for all the bedrooms at night.

17     Mdm SLK said she would occasionally check in on J at night, and that there was once where she found the Accused “_squatting beside J’s bed and touching her head. And I asked what he’s doing there and I asked him to get off the room. Maybe --- maybe it was in a high volume, maybe --- I don’t know, maybe I used to speak quite loud in the --- in the house_”.[^38] Mdm SLK then confirmed that the Accused got out as instructed. This incident took place during the material period.[^39]

18     Turning to the day when J first raised the complaint, Mdm SLK said that J came home one day from JC, and said she had something to tell her. She then read the message which J had typed into her phone. Mdm SLK said she ‘got a shock’. She also said J cried. Mdm SLK summarised the message thus: “_in the night, he \[sic\] was – disturbed by him_”.[^40] Mdm SLK explained that it meant that J had been touched by the Accused in the night. When her husband came back later, Mdm SLK updated him. They agonised over it, with all three ending up in tears; J’s father also said it was a mistake to have allowed the Accused to stay at their home.[^41] After calling the police ‘for information’, they decided to report the matter the next day – this led to the Police Report (Exhibit P2). Mdm SLK said they had to wait outside while J went into the interview room by herself with the police officer to give her statement. In closing, Mdm SLK said that she did not know the full details about each incident, and that she had stopped pressing J for them when J said “_I don’t want to make you cry Mummy. Don’t force me to say out_.”[^42]

19     Looking back to 2010, Mdm SLK said J’s behaviour towards the Accused changed: she was not talking to him so much, and not holding his hand unlike when she was younger. J also appeared ‘very stressed and not happy’, but Mdm SLK thought then that it was just due to school.[^43]

## Close of Prosecution’s Case:

20     At the close of the Prosecution’s Case, a coherent account was before the court. It painted a picture of an accused uncle taking advantage of his young niece under the cover of night, during a period where she was particularly exhausted from her studies. The testimony about the acts of molest on each occasion were detailed, and they showed an escalation with bolder intrusions over time. These night visits stopped when J’s mother fortuitously caught the Accused in J’s room one night before he touched her again. The last incident appeared to be opportunistic in comparison, taking place a few months later in completely different circumstances. J was young at 13-14 years old, and she struggled as to how to process the situation. She finally came forward some years later when she could struggle with it privately no more.

21     Against this, the Defence did not make any “no case” submissions.[^44] My own review found that there was sufficient evidence to call on the defence of the Accused. The standard allocution was rendered, and the Accused opted to take the stand to offer his account.

## DW1: The Accused Uncle.

22     The Accused testified in Mandarin, and he confirmed all the undisputed preliminaries on his relationship with J and her family, how he came to stay at J’s home, and the period that he was there.[^45]

#### \-   Relationship with J and her family:

23     The Accused said that he would play badminton and computer games with the two children, and that he also helped them with Chinese homework. All this represented time which J’s parents could ill afford themselves, and the children grew close to him as a result; especially J whom he said was ‘very attached’ to him. He would call her “little princess”, and he said she welcomed his attention. He said he treated them like his own children.[^46]

#### \-   Events during the material period:

24     In that capacity, the Accused said that he would sometimes check in on J at night. He explained that he had to go to the toilet on some nights, and that it involves passing J’s bedroom – see the sketch plan of the apartment which was admitted and marked as Exhibit P3. On those occasions when he heard some noises coming from J’s room on those occasions, he would check on her. He said he would stand at J’s doorway and check if she was ok by asking “little princess, are you alright?”, and that he would go in to gently pat her head if he saw her rousing or moving. After she went back to sleep, he would then kiss her forehead before leaving the room. He could not remember how many times he did this.[^47]

25     On one such occasion, the Accused confirmed that J’s mother saw him inside and had ‘told him not to wake her up and to come out of the room’.[^48] He said he was just about to leave anyway – after having already patted J back to sleep and having kissed her forehead – when J’s mother found him in there.[^49] He said that J’s mother spoke to him softly because everyone in the flat was sleeping.[^50]

26     When asked if he could remember any _other_ occasion when he entered J’s bedroom, the Accused said that there was once where he saw J move a bit when he was on his way to the toilet. As a result, he again stood at the doorway and asked “J, are you okay?”. Seeing her move a little in response, he then went in to take a look and saw her sleeping at a 45 degree angle, with a blanket on. He said he then kissed the side of her _right_ thigh and also pointed to the area on his own _right_ thigh, before leaving the room. The Accused confirmed it was J’s _right_ thigh when learned Counsel asked him to clarify. When learned Counsel asked the Accused to confirm it again, the Accused became suitably prompted and changed, and said that he had kissed the side of J’s _left_ thigh instead, explaining that he pointed to his own right thigh earlier because he ‘wanted to show it to Counsel’.[^51]

27     When learned Counsel asked what was his purpose in entering J’s bedroom on these occasions, the Accused replied that ‘during that period, J had told me that she was feeling stressful over her exams and it was hard for her to fall asleep, so I will pay special attention to her’.[^52] By this answer, the Accused effectively dated those two occasions to the material period. When DC asked why he had to call out to her like that before entering the bedroom, the Accused said it was ‘better that way’ because he wanted ‘to confirm whether she was sleeping’. He said he checked on her out of concern because he treated her like his own child, and he wanted to see if she was okay.

28     When learned Counsel asked the Accused to try and date those two occasions more specifically in 2009, the Accused answered that he could not. He then surprisingly said that those were not two occasions but one and the same, i.e. the occasion where he kissed her thigh was the same one when J’s mother had found him there and called him out of the room.[^53] Even though this clearly contradicted his earlier testimony, learned Counsel did not delve further.

#### ■   J’s motive:

29     Turning to the 6 alleged incidents in the Charges, the Accused said that he did not enter J’s bedroom that many times and that he did not do any of those things alleged. He surmised that J laid these false allegations against him when he moved out, got a girlfriend in 2012, and had drastically reduced the time he spent with J as a result.[^54] The Accused pointed to a SMS that he sent to the J household on **24**th**August 2012**.[^55] It was sent by him in response to earlier messages from the J household asking him to come by and collect his mail; it read (D2 page 5, s/no. 46): “_Coming coming wait for my queen to arrange time. I’m just a small soldier :-D_” The Accused surmised that J, being the ‘little princess’, was unhappy that there was now an ‘empress’ above her.[^56] He said there was however no discernible change in J’s behaviour towards him in 2009 or 2010, and that J was still affectionate towards him and that their relationship was good. He said that J would hug and kiss him on the cheek, that he would kiss her back on the forehead, and that J’s mother saw all this and said nothing against it.

30     The Accused also said after he moved out (in October 2010), J would send messages to him that showed she was missing him. He cited the facebook message dated 13 Dec **2011** where J wished him a belated happy birthday[^57] and asked “_when are you calling me?_” (D1 page 4, s/no. 2), and the SMS dated 26 May **2012** (D2 page 5, s/no. 27) where J looked forward to a scheduled gathering and said “_9am. Ah ok? See you shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu_”.

31     Additionally, the Accused said that J also invited him to attend a ceremony at the end of **2010** after doing well in school. By then, the Accused had already moved out for a few months. He said he drove in from Malaysia for that event, and that J was very happy to see him there.[^58] He said J ran over to him, held on to his hands, and said “_Uncle, look, I’ve got very good results_.”[^59]

32     The Accused also said that J had travelled to KL. This trip was organised by one Aunt S (whom he referred to as his cousin C) and who brought her daughter SV (i.e. J’s cousin) and J along. The Accused dated this trip as December **2009** – this conflicted with the 2010 period instead mentioned by J when she was cross-examined on this, and it appeared that his recollection of the date was wrong. The Accused said the group stayed at a KL hotel, and that he went to bring them sightseeing after they called in on him. He said J was ‘very passionate’ and had run over to hug him when they met.[^60]

33     After getting to know his girlfriend in **2012**, he wanted to bring Ms PMF along for a dim sum gathering with J’s family. When they arrived at the flat, they were greeted by J’s mother, J’s brother and J (J’s father was then in one of the rooms), and the Accused introduced Ms PMF (DW3) to them as his girlfriend. The Accused said J did not say anything then. After some time, they got ready, and left for the restaurant. Once there, all of them sat at the same table. After the meal, they all went to visit cousin C (i.e. Aunt S) where he again introduced Ms PMF as his girlfriend. Throughout this time, the Accused said J was quieter than usual. While at cousin C’s home, the Accused said there was an incident where J suddenly ran up to him and told him “_I don’t like your girlfriend. I don’t want to speak to her._” This took place when his girlfriend was not around because she had gone to the toilet. The Accused said he felt surprised at that outburst, and put it down to jealousy because his attention was no longer on his little princess.[^61] He said there was no prior unpleasant incident between his girlfriend and J that could have made J say that.

34     The Accused said there was another subsequent incident in **2013** which was also relevant. He said he had promised to buy J a pair of shoes, but ultimately did not. So during an occasion when he returned to the J household to collect his mail, J confronted him over it. He said he reached there in the morning and J’s mother received him. J was then in her room, and J’s mother went to knock on J’s door saying “_You didn’t call cousin-uncle?_” J instead replied in a harsh tone “_No need to_.” The Accused then asked “_What’s wrong Little Princess?_”, and J got angry and said that he had yet to buy her the pair of shoes which he promised.[^62] He then said that he would buy it for her the next time he saw her, but J did not reply after that. The Accused then left. The Accused explained in court that the shoes were quite expensive and cost more than $200.

#### ■   The biased IO and the tainted statement:

35     Not long after that outburst, the Accused was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint. He was shocked when he was informed that J had reported him for molesting her. He was subsequently brought before IO Lim whom he found to be ‘a bit rough in his speech and in a forceful manner’, and speaking loudly.[^63] He said IO Lim told him “_You molested your niece. A small girl. I have a niece myself. I don’t touch her. Why did you touch a child?_” and repeatedly said that he had removed J’s clothing. This despite the Accused continually denying that he did. IO Lim kept accusing him “_You definitely have done something to the girl for the little girl to come and report. You admit, you admit._” The IO also said that he would have 8 charges against the Accused if he did not admit. The Accused asked the IO what these 8 charges were, but the IO did not say, and the Accused ‘felt very helpless and angry’.[^64]

36     The Accused then gave an example of how the IO was against him in interpreting what he said: after the IO forcefully told him to admit, the Accused told the IO that he ‘_could have touched by accident because I myself do not know_’ but the IO responded instead “_Then that means you touched_.”[^65] A statement was recorded from him in that manner, and after it was printed out, the IO “just threw it on the table and asked me to sign” without even reading it to him. The Accused said he did not read it either and just signed as instructed.[^66] He was then brought back to the lock-up.

37     The next morning, the IO took him out to the interview room again and told him “_Now that you have admitted you have touched her breast then you might as well admit to the other eight charges_”. The Accused responded that he did not admit earlier, and also asked for details of the 8 charges, but the IO just kept repeating ‘8 charges’. The Accused then said he wanted to see his earlier statement to check if there was any error, but the IO told him it was not possible and that he ‘could tell the judge’.[^67] Later that day, he was released on bail.

38     About 2 years later on 17th June **2015**, the Accused was called down to the station by the second IO: IO Brian Sng. There, the Accused said he was shown the Charges for the first time, and he said he felt very disappointed and very angry about the allegations against him. The Accused became emotional at this point in the witness box. He then continued and said that he denied all the Charges to the new IO, and responded to them instead by stating that ‘J’s room door was sometimes closed at night, that J was still contacting him after the alleged incidents, and surmising that J had concocted the allegations because he had failed to buy the $200+ shoes as promised’.[^68] His Cautioned Statements to the 6 Charges were admitted and marked collectively as Exhibit **D8**.

#### ■   Palmar Hyperhidrosis

39     Finally, the Accused said he had sweaty palms since very young. It was severe, and would get worse when he was nervous or excited, e.g. when he was sexually aroused. It was thus contended that J’s description of the sensations she felt from his hands and fingers indicated that her account was plainly untrue.

40     The learned DPP mounted an equally robust cross-examination of the defence. It did not stand up to scrutiny with various inconsistencies and coherence issues being laid bare. I detail all of these areas later. His credibility was also called into question when it was shown that he had given a previous inconsistent statement on his position – one which partially admitted to the molests; this was the long statement which was recorded by the first IO. The Accused admitted that the statement was voluntary, but that it was inaccurate for the reasons he cited earlier. This then set the stage for first IO to be called as a rebuttal witness.

## DW2: Dr John Thomas

41     Dr John Thomas was the Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon who examined the Accused and confirmed the diagnosis of severe idiopathic palmar hyperhidrosis.[^69] The doctor examined him on 24 April 2017, and noted that both his palms were wet from sweat, and that “_severe sweating had an onset within 1 minute of drying of the palms_”.[^70] The doctor added that the severity of his condition meant that his palms would be ‘soggy to the touch’.[^71] The doctor also said that such conditions usually got worse when the person was excited, including sexually.[^72]

42     When learned Counsel asked the doctor to comment on J’s evidence that she could tell the difference when the Accused was touching her with his hands as opposed to using his tongue because the hands were dry, the doctor interestingly noted that it had “nothing to do with wetness” and the ‘primary difference in sensation is in the structure, in that hands have bones, whereas the tongue does not’, and whether one ‘recognised the wetness or not is instead the second problem’.[^73] The doctor’s answer quite remarkably aligned with J’s account on how the touch from his tongue and penis felt different from his fingers rubbing which was ‘hard and painful’ for her at her vagina.[^74]

43     During cross-examination, the doctor conceded that he did not personally verify the exact onset of this palmar hyperhidrosis condition in the Accused, and had just accepted the history offered up by the Accused that it started since young.[^75]

## DW3: Ms PMF - Accused’s Girlfriend

44     Ms PMF testified in Mandarin. She confirmed that the Accused had brought her to meet the J household in 2012. There was a small contradiction in their accounts: whereas the Accused said that his cousin (i.e. J’s father) was in the bedroom when they arrived and entered the flat, Ms PMF instead said that J’s father and mother had greeted them and opened the main door for them when they arrived at the flat.[^76] Ms PMF said that she was then introduced to all 4 members of the J household. They sat at the living room for a chat, but only J did not join in and instead returned to her bedroom. After a while, they left for the planned dim sum meal. At the restaurant, Ms PMF said that J did not look at her or talk to her, unlike the rest at the table.[^77] After the meal, they left to visit Aunt S. Whilst there, Ms PMF remembers that the adults sat at the living room to chat while the children, including J and her brother, went into one of the rooms. After that visit, Ms PMF said that J’s brother, D, brought her and the Accused to Marina Bay for a walk. She said D had asked J if she wanted to join in, but J declined. Ms PMF said she knew this because D told them.[^78] Ms PMF said that she felt J’s behaviour in not wanting to talk to her ‘was strange or weird because the Accused had told her prior that his relationship with both J and D was close, and that was why she was eager to meet them as a result.[^79] Ms PMF then confirmed that since that occasion, she did not thereafter meet J again.

45     The next occasion when she met J again was in court when she had to step into the courtroom for J to identify her. Even then, Ms PMF said that J “did not even look at me”, and “refused to look at me always”.[^80] Ms PMF said that it also seemed as if J was “pretending not to know me”.[^81] Ms PMF felt this way when J answered that she had never seen Ms PMF before. Ms PMF also said that when she saw J leave the courtroom later, it seemed that J “deliberately did not want to look at me” because J “turned her head to stare at me for a moment in a very quick manner”.

46     Finally, Ms PMF said that she was also from Malaysia, and had been colleagues with the Accused prior to them getting together as a couple – she was an operator at the factory and he was a technician. Since 2004 – some 5 years before the material period – she said that she had already noticed the sweaty hands of the Accused as they were then working in the same team. Since becoming a couple, she confirmed that they have been physically intimate, and that on such occasions, his hands always felt ‘very wet, very cold, and very sticky on her body’.[^82] She assisted to take photos of his palms after learned Counsel requested, and these were admitted and marked as Exhibits **D12** and **D13**.

## DW4: Mdm WAM – Accused’s mother

47     Mdm WAM confirmed that the Accused was her son. She said that she first noticed that he had sweaty palms when he was just 7-8 years old.[^83]

48     During cross-examination, the learned DPP sought to confirm whether Mdm WAM saw that his palms were still sweaty during the material period of 2009 and 2010. When Mdm WAM was first asked how many times did the Accused go back to visit her during that period, she said that she did not count but that he did _occasionally_ go back. When the DPP later asked her whether she agreed that she did not really know because her interactions with the Accused during that period were limited, Mdm WAM disagreed and said that the Accused actually used to visit her _regularly every month_ in the past. When she was asked to confirm that it was really every month, Mdm WAM back-tracked and said that she could not really remember, but that “he will come back to visit me when he was not working.[^84] She however said that she knew his hands were still sweaty throughout that material period. Mdm WAM appeared to be clearly very anxious for the Accused.

## DW5: Ms PWF – Accused’s sister

49     Ms PWF confirmed that the Accused was her elder brother. Ms PWF said the Accused had sweaty palms since young. She remembers first noting this when they were playing cards and the cards held by him would be wet and tend to stick together – the Accused was 10 years old at the time. Ms PWF said that she also had sweaty palms but it was not as serious as the Accused.

50     The same cross-examination point was pursued by the learned DPP with Ms PWF, and she fared similarly as her mother Mdm WAM.[^85]

## PW3: IO SSSgt Lim Yong Sheng: Rebuttal witness

51     Given the allegations made by the Accused against IO Lim on how his long statement was recorded (which was admitted and marked as Exhibit P6), the Prosecution called IO Lim to court to address those allegations. SSSgt Lim confirmed that he was the recording officer for the long statement. At that time, he was holding the rank of Staff Sergeant, and he had been an IO for about 4 years.[^86]

52     The records showed that the Accused was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint at 1835 hrs on 25 July 2013. At about 2220 hrs, he arrived at the lockup of Clementi Police Division. He was offered food and drink, and the chance to have the Malaysian embassy contacted, but the Accused declined them all.[^87] Shortly thereafter, he was then brought out for the interview.[^88] SSSgt Lim said that the interview was in Mandarin. He told the Accused that he was arrested for a case of molest, and asked if he could remember what happened. The statement was thus recorded into the computer, and SSSgt Lim said he was not forceful and he recorded whatever the Accused told him. The statements contents were ultimately mixed. Some portions were exculpatory, and a partial admission was also entered: that he had entered J’s room _“2-3 times”_ in the night while she was sleeping to touch her by _“I also move my hand down and press her breast from outside her clothing about 2 to 3 times. I also did kiss her at her buttock from outside her clothing”_.[^89] SSSgt Lim also said that after the recording was completed, he printed out the statement, and handed it to the Accused. He then read it to the Accused in Mandarin, and also asked the Accused to read it once more on his own and to let him know if changes were required. The Accused then signed on the statement after doing so. Although the Accused did appear worried, SSSgt Lim said he was cooperative and did not complain about being hungry or tired.[^90] The statement recording took an hour plus (started at **10.45 pm** on 25 July 2013, and ended at **12.25 am** on 26th July 2013). After being returned to the lockup, the Accused requested and was given one Cup Noodles for his consumption.

53     The next morning, after discussing the matter with the case supervisor, the decision was made to release the Accused on bail. SSSgt Lim then went to inform the Accused. SSSgt Lim also told the Accused not to contact the complainant or the family members, and also explained the bail procedure and requirements to him. The Accused made no requests nor had he anything to add. After arranging a bailor, the Accused was then released at about 1545 hrs. As part of the final procedures, he was asked by the station officers if he had any complaints or feedback, and he confirmed that he had none and signed his signature. The Prosecution produced copies of the station documents (Exhibits P7, P8 and P9) which confirmed these aspects.[^91] The Accused did not dispute the signatures.[^92]

54     After being released on bail, SSSgt Lim said the Accused had to report back to the bail office at Clementi Police Division every month. On one such occasion, he came back and requested to see SSSgt Lim. The Accused then handed SSSgt Lim a letter and asked for the investigations to be speeded up. SSSgt Lim told him he would do what he could. The letter and its enclosures were admitted and marked as Exhibit **P10**. Though signed by the Accused, it was undated. Part of it read ‘it has been a year \[since my arrest\] and I hope the investigations can be speeded up’; that would then date this letter to sometime in **2014**. The enclosures to the letter included some photos of J and some messages he had with her during the material period.

55     During cross-examination, SSSgt Lim conceded that the long statement P6 was not verbatim and that the Accused initially denied the allegations. SSSgt Lim however explained that this initial denial took place right at the start while they were chatting as he set up the computer.[^93] When the recording started, SSSgt Lim only told the Accused the general allegation of molest against him and did not go into the specifics; he candidly admitted that he did ask the Accused to “_think properly_” and that he did use words to the effect: _“Look, if you didn’t do it, why would the girl make such an allegation?”_.[^94] SSSgt Lim denied the Defence position though that he had been forceful with the Accused, and explained that the Accused took a long time to provide his responses, and that was why the statement took about 2 hours to complete. SSSgt Lim said that the statement was accurate and that he recorded down all that the Accused wished to say – all the exculpatory portions together with the implicatory portions were all from the Accused. Throughout the cross-examination, SSSgt Lim maintained that the statement’s contents came from the Accused and that he had no reason to purposely record a misleading statement from the Accused. He also reiterated that the statement was read back to the Accused, and that the Accused did also read it on his own before signing it.

## REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE:

56     At the end of the trial, there were only two possibilities. This was either a credible complaint of a young lady who had finally found the courage to face up to what her uncle had done to her when she was much younger, or it was a tale completely born of a twisted perversion of her vindictive mind to get back at her uncle for essentially abandoning her, seemingly for another. These were the only two scenarios actively postulated as to who J was, and how her evidence was to be treated.[^95] I now set out in broad terms how I reviewed the evidence presented by both sides on these scenarios.

57     First, as a case, I recognised that the Defence had _pursued_ a plausible position. I accepted that complainants can perjure themselves for the reasons stated, and that IOs can sometimes be fixated and forceful. Pursuing a case is however distinct from presenting one. Whilst the evidence presented by the Defence on these areas did not stand up well to the initial scrutiny of cross-examination, I nonetheless approached the review of the Prosecution’s evidence to see if there was any material there which potentially supported the Defence Case. Supportive material can either be overt (e.g. in the form of outright admissions in cross-examination), or covert (e.g. in the form of demeanour, inconsistencies and coherence issues in the account). There were none in the former. As for the latter, the Defence made various submissions that there were. I considered each carefully, but found them to be flawed. I considered them cumulatively as well, but concluded that they did not form basis either to be concerned about J’s objectivity and reliability as a witness. In the end, I found J’s credibility and account were in fact supported. The evidence from the Defence was instead suspect and unreliable. These were the broad steps I went through in the review. I now detail each in turn.

## The Flaws in the Defence’s Criticisms of J’s Account:

58     As noted earlier, J provided a detailed account about the incidents. She also put forth a coherent explanation as to why she suffered them in silence, and why she continued to pretend that everything was fine with her. Objectively, J’s account was substantively clear, complete and coherent. J also delivered the account with conviction. Conscious though as to one’s fallibility in perceptions on demeanour, learned Counsel was therefore afforded complete scope to test her account and her motivations in laying this complaint against the Accused. No quarter was given. The cross-examination was rigorous and lengthy – lasting the better part of 4 days. In probing J’s account, Counsel did not follow a chronological sequence, moving from incident to incident in a discontinuous manner to see if J’s account would become unhinged. Counsel also tested the consistency of her recount on the details and even suggested other positions to her. Through it all, J ultimately remained consistent as to what happened on the 6 occasions. She was also able to provide coherent details when probed on the periphery of her account. She also refuted the alleged motive ascribed to her for bringing these complaints against her uncle. Her performance under cross-examination gained her credibility. I now explain why the Defence submissions to the contrary were flawed.

### ■   That J’s Identification Evidence Changed:

59     The Defence submitted that J had changed her evidence, citing how she shifted and incrementally moved in her testimony from poor certainty of identification (that it was the Accused who had molested her), to near certainty.[^96] I could not accept this submission as it was factually flawed. An objective review of J’s evidence will instead show that she had explained from the outset that she knew it was the Accused because she looked and saw that it was him. She did this after each molest episode ended as he was leaving her room. She testified clearly that she knew it was the Accused on each occasion as she could recognise from his height, weight, and attire that it was him. There was no dispute during the trial that these physical attributes of the Accused were distinct and unique to him. There was also no dispute during the trial that there was ambient light which made it possible for J to see all this.[^97] Even J’s claim of having recognised the voice of the Accused as he whispered that he loved her (during the fifth incident) added little to her already certain position that she knew it was the Accused from the outset. J did not waver on this during cross-examination. It was therefore factually inaccurate to say that J had shifted in her evidence.

### ■   That J’s Account was Augmented by a Reference to the Charge:

60     The Defence next submitted that J was an untruthful witness, and that this could be seen from her reliance upon documents to aid her recount in court.[^98] Specifically, the Defence cited how J had added the allegation that the Accused had touched her breasts and rubbed her nipples only after having _referred_ to the contents in the 1st Charge. I could not agree with this submission as it was factually inaccurate. Whilst it was true that J did not initially mention that her breasts and nipples had been touched, and whilst it is true that the Charges were indeed before her in the witness box, it was my observation that J actually did not rely upon them to aid her recount. This episode is captured in the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) on day 1 starting at page 15. After offering up her initial account as to what happened during the first incident (which made no mention about her breasts and nipples being intruded on), J was asked by the learned DPP to draw a sketch of her bedroom. It was only during this exercise – where J had to make space amongst the papers before her in the witness box – that the Defence took issue with the Charges being possibly referred to. The objection was promptly made at the start of that exercise, and the Charges were just as promptly removed from the witness box. In making the objection, learned Counsel also explicitly stated that he did not want J’s recount of the first incident being aided by her reference to the acts stated in the Charge. Despite being alerted so as to the exact issue, i.e. that her recount was possibly different from the Charge, J did not on her own accord go on to correct her earlier testimony by adding in the missing portion. J in fact went on to testify on other areas and was seemingly content to just leave the matter be. It was therefore apparent to me that J did not actually manage to refer to the particulars in the Charge. J only added the detail about her breasts and nipples being intruded on when the DPP later looped back at page 18 to confirm the acts of the Accused during the 1st incident.

61     This observation (that J did not manage to refer to specifics in the Charge) was confirmed by J herself during cross-examination. J was robustly questioned on why she had left out this material aspect in her initial recount. J answered that she had some trouble remembering at the start of her testimony in evidence-in-chief because she was feeling extremely stressed out on having to come to court to testify; J maintained that the detail was included after she calmed down in the witness box, and not because she had managed to refer to the Charge.[^99] This explanation cohered with my observations of that episode. It did indeed take place near the start of her time in the witness box, and it was during the instance where she had to recount what happened to her for the first time. In that context, I also did not think that her initial omission of that particular detail ought to be accorded such a disproportionate significance.

### ■   That J’s Account was Formulaic because 3 Incidents were Identical:

62     The Defence next submitted that J’s account was “formulaic” because her recount of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th incidents were identical.[^100] This submission drew strength from the position that there was something artificial about molest incidents being identical. At its core, this submission relied upon a conception that sexual offenders never repeat their preferred acts of intrusion. I could not agree with this conception and found it to be flawed. In and of itself, the mere fact that three of the alleged incidents were identical did not necessarily raise cause for concern. History and experience shows that there is nothing inherently incredible about a sexual perpetrator, having found a successful _modus operandi_, going on to repeat and exploit it a few more times; nor that the person would have a predilection towards certain sexual acts. This is in fact all too common the case.[^101] I therefore did not think that J’s account on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th incidents should be faulted just because she had stated that the acts committed on those occasions were identical.

### ■   That J’s Account on the 6th Incident was Inconceivable:

63     The Defence next submitted that J’s account on the 6th incident was artificial, because it was “inconceivable” that the Accused would dare to molest J in broad daylight after he had been confronted by J’s mother over his presence in J’s bedroom in the night.[^102] This submission drew strength from the position that the confrontation was sufficient to see off all further adventurism by the Accused. I could not agree with this. The confrontation represented a close call for the Accused – one where he still ultimately managed to get away scot free. Whilst it was sufficient to see off further adventurism in the night in the immediate aftermath, the 6th incident was distinct from the others in that it appeared to be clearly opportunistic since it happened a few months later during the day in completely different circumstances. The Accused had reason for being present in J’s bedroom then, and the implication was plain in J’s account: that the Accused succumbed to his basal urges and simply could not resist when he saw the tempting opportunity all laid out in front of him on that day. In that context, I did not think there was anything palpably inconceivable about the 6th incident.

### ■   That J had Embellished her Account with More Incidents:

64     The Defence next submitted that J was not a witness of truth because she had embellished her account during cross-examination by offering up details of another three more incidents apart from the 6 in issue (the three were less serious in comparison). The Defence submitted that these additional three incidents had been _deliberately omitted_ by J earlier.[^103] I considered this carefully because an expanding account does raise questions. In the end, I could not agree because the submission was factually inaccurate for one of those incidents, and factually tenuous for the others. An objective review of J’s evidence-in-chief will show that she was not given free reign by the learned trial DPP. By that, I mean that the DPP was exacting in his focus, eliciting only the core account from J that was necessary to lay basis for the 6 Charges. At one point, J actually gave hint that she was ready to offer more, but the DPP curiously did not pursue. This hint took place on day 1 at page 21 of the NE, where J indicated that she had stayed up one night and that she managed to push the Accused away when he came into her bedroom that night. This “pushed away incident” was in fact one of the three other incidents which J ultimately testified on during cross-examination. Therefore, insofar as this incident was concerned, it was factually inaccurate to say that J had deliberately omitted mention of it in her evidence-in-chief.

65     Turning to the other two incidents, there were also very specific reasons to doubt that J had deliberately omitted their mention. First, as a matter of historical fact, J had actually alluded to them from the onset, i.e. in her very first police statement in 2013.[^104] This indicated that the 3 other incidents were not new materials which she was making up in cross-examination for the first time. Second, the trial DPP in this case appeared to have entered the picture at a stage when the decision had already been made by the Prosecution to pursue only the 6 Charges; and that was the course he then plotted for the trial. J said she actually told the Police about the other incidents, and had reiterated them when she was interviewed by another DPP in the lead-up to the trial. She was however later informed that these other incidents would not form the basis of Charges, and that the trial would focus on the 6 main incidents instead.[^105] With that context, J just focussed on the 6 main incidents and testified accordingly. Third, when cross-examination began, J was asked if there were any other incidents apart from the 6, and J confirmed that there were ‘no others which involved such intimate contact’ – an answer which easily cohered with her stance all along about the existence of these three other incidents.[^106] In my judgment, this did not appear to be a case where J was deliberately omitting mention of the three other incidents. J was in fact being quite consistent instead.

### ■   That J’s Evidence of the Three Other Incidents Raised Further Doubts:

66     The Defence next submitted that the 3 other incidents raised further doubts about J’s account. Much of this submission relied upon the clumsy and confused manner of their introduction into evidence, and I now set out in gist what happened. The 3 other incidents all lay in the periphery of the core account – an area which the learned trial DPP had, as earlier stated, seemingly consciously chose not to venture into. Details of the 3 other incidents came when learned Counsel probed that area instead. At some point during J’s cross-examination, the DPP gave disclosure of two police statements given by J, in apparent discharge of their _Kader_ obligations to the Defence. After studying the materials, the Defence started probing J even more on some other details; seemingly testing her memory and pinning her down on various points in her account in order to lay the groundwork for an impeachment exercise. One point pursued was in relation to whether J had informed the police about the details of the 3 other incidents. When J kept reiterating that she did, and that she had even told an earlier DPP who was handling the case, the questioning became agitated and confused because her two statements (which were disclosed to Counsel – and not before the court) patently did not have those details. Seeing the agitation and confusion, I then asked the Prosecution to do another check to confirm if there were any other statements recorded from J. It was then discovered that a further police statement was indeed recorded from J where she had offered up those specific details.[^107] It appeared that this further statement had escaped the attention of the trial DPP up till that point. As a result, it became apparent that he gave Counsel the completely misguided impression that his complainant on the stand was being contradictory when she was really not. In short, the disclosure of J’s statements to Counsel was not only incomplete, but potentially unwarranted after all. The DPP’s curious handling of J’s evidence-in-chief earlier appeared less curious now.

67     Whilst this regrettable lapse meant that J was badly served – in terms of having to endure a heatedly extended (and ultimately pointless) questioning from Counsel on whether she was being consistent – it was not entirely in vain as it allowed me to observe her as she perservered through the entire confused episode. Ultimately, it afforded a better assessment of her stance as a witness, i.e. that she was taking a step-by-step, point for point, literal approach. The cross-examination on this episode made it especially apparent that J was taking this approach whilst on the stand. J herself said that she was just explaining it as best she could at each instance.[^108] In her own words: “_I never think so much, I just answering your questions._”[^109]. This observation is important when reviewing the NE, which is littered with instances in cross-examination where questions and answers were posed and offered in quick succession – sometimes before the preceding one had even completed. J was demonstrably ready and eager to offer her evidence and to address all queries. This however had the effect of the NE sometimes taking a few initial turns before the final position/point being pursued actually becoming clearer a few pages later. Further, although J was comfortably conversant in English, it was also apparent that she had difficulty getting used to the precision of language being used in court by Counsel; language that sometimes referenced only very narrow and specific points, and which demanded a response only to those narrow and specific points. J also had some difficulty dealing with the layered constructs that were occasionally being put to her. To Counsel’s credit, he allowed J to clarify whenever she was clearly in difficulty. The NE therefore has to be reviewed with all these in mind. Returning to the 3 other incidents, introduced as they were in that manner, their details in chronological order were as follows:

68      **The Computer Desk Incident:** J said that around the beginning of 2009 (several months before the main incidents), she was in her brother’s room to use the desk computer; that was the only computer in the home. That room was also the room used by the Accused then. She said the Accused touched her breast from behind while she was at the desk.[^110] J said the Accused slipped his hand underneath her shirt and touched her breasts over her bra. The touch was brief, not skin on skin, and she did not react.[^111]

69      **The Pushed Away Incident:** J said that she was on ‘high alert’ after the first night incident, and that she had tried her best to stay awake so that she could stop the Accused, but that she did not ultimately manage to.[^112] When she did fall into slumber, she said she was a heavy sleeper during that period (exam preparations). On this occasion however, she was still awake when the Accused came into her room, and she had pushed and told him to go away (and which he did) before he did anything to her.

70      **The Tossed and Turned Incident:** Finally, J was questioned on a further 3rd incident which was alluded to in her first police statement: one where the Accused had apparently come into her room at night about a week after the 5th incident, and had tried to touch her but left after she kept tossing and turning about.[^113] J answered that whilst she did not remember this now in court, she thinks it did take place since it was in her police statement because her memory of the material events was better then. J said it has been some 3 years since giving that statement, and that she has actually been ‘trying to forget, trying to move on in life, trying to cope’ with this matter.[^114] J became emotional during this questioning, but declined the offer of a break in the proceedings.[^115] When she continued her testimony, she maintained that she did not remember this incident.[^116]

71     On a broad level, the Defence submitted that J’s testimony about these 3 other incidents showed that J was being caught out on peripheral areas which were outside of her core account. This submission would gain strength if J’s answers on these peripheral areas were incoherent and/or inconsistent with her core account. This was however not the case. From the answers given, there was nothing overtly conflicting that the Accused had allegedly also acted that way on those 3 other occasions. Objectively, the overall picture of an accused uncle having allegedly taken advantage of a young niece remained intact.

72     The Defence also submitted more specifically that if the “computer desk incident” really took place in early 2009, i.e. several months before the 1st incident, then it would have constituted a clear warning of the uncle’s inclinations towards her. This was especially since there was no mistaking those actions (of having allegedly slipped his hand under her shirt to touch her breasts) as anything remotely innocent or accidental. In those circumstances, J’s continued conduct of being close to her uncle, and not apparently taking any special precautions was at odds with a person who had been so warned. This submission has an intuitive appeal and I considered it carefully. I could not completely agree with it because it rested upon an imprecise premise: the notion that victims always enjoy perfect and accurate perception, are completely objectively rational, and can always be counted on to act promptly and logically pursuant to that perception and reasoning. That notion is a stretch even for the best of us. It is even more so when the victim involves a young inexperienced person (J had just turned 12 years old a few months before the alleged computer desk incident). The matter is compounded exponentially when the perpetrator happens to be a trusted adult in a familial setting to that young person, and whose sense of identity was closely tied to the perpetrator. J herself confirmed all this when she was confronted by the Defence on this point. She readily conceded that it was indeed a warning sign now _on hindsight_, but explained that she perceived things differently during that time when she was younger, and that she did not know what to do then.[^117] I therefore did not think that J’s lack of reaction, or her conduct after the computer desk incident of not taking any particular precautions, was necessarily indicative of artificiality in her account.

73     The final point in this area related to the “pushed away incident”. J was cross-examined on the seeming incoherence: because if J had the gumption to stand up for herself like that, then it was curious why she did not have the same gumption on the other occasions when she woke to find the Accused touching her. To be clear, the Defence did not go on to submit on this point, but I think it is important for me to address it because it was covered in cross-examination. I considered the seeming incongruity, but there was one key difference between those two situations: in the latter, J woke to find herself _in the midst_ of being molested. There was no time in that situation to gird oneself up mentally to take action to confront the Accused; she simply woke to find him having his way with her. I think it is important to recognise this distinction, and how potentially traumatising it is to wake mid-point and find oneself in that kind of situation. Especially if one was a 13 year old and – by all accounts – was completely inexperienced in those matters. For similar reasons, the “tossed and turned incident” appeared to be correspondingly coherent with this distinction because she woke when she heard him coming and had about just enough time to gird herself up to take those indirect ‘defensive’ measures of tossing and turning _before_ he had started touching her on that occasion. In court, J turned visibly emotional as she was cross-examined on the coherence of her actions, and whether she did enough for herself; she nonetheless insisted on pressing on and declined the offer of a break in the proceedings.[^118] On its part, the Defence did not go on to press her further on this aspect, and as indicated earlier, it also did not ultimately make any submissions on this aspect either.

74     In the end, the review showed that neither the substance nor the manner in which J offered up her evidence of the 3 other incidents gave cause for concern over her credibility.

### ■   That J’s Credit was Impeached given her Previous Inconsistent Statements:

75     The Defence next submitted that J was unworthy of credit because her court testimony about her core account was, at various points, inconsistent with the version which she had given to the Police earlier in her statements. As recounted earlier, the Defence had obtained disclosure of J’s first two police statements. After obtaining the statements, the cross-examination seemingly became a memory testing exercise where Counsel pinned J down on her account and compared it with the details in her statements. In the end, three apparent contradictions with J’s court testimony were found, and her two police statements were introduced in court: the first statement was the one recorded from J when she came forward for the first time to make the complaint (i.e. in June 2013); and the second statement was recorded from her some 2 years later (i.e. in May 2015) when the second IO took over the case and sought some clarifications on her account. Both statements were admitted and marked as Exhibits D6 and D7 respectively. Leave was granted for J to be cross-examined on the differences. The areas of divergence are set out below together with J’s explanation for them, and the corresponding submissions from the Defence.

76      **Whether she had been kissed anywhere else:** During cross-examination, J was asked if the Accused had kissed her anywhere else, during any of the incidents, apart from her left cheek in the 5th Charge, and J answered in the negative.[^119] However in J’s second statement (D7 at A3 on page 2), J said that during the 3rd incident, the Accused had ‘kissed her on her lips and tried to force his tongue into her mouth but did not manage to as she clenched her teeth tightly’. Further that the Accused had also ‘licked her left ear’, and that she could feel his wet tongue and breath there. When confronted with this “tongued/licked detail”, J conceded that she did not have a clear memory of this now in court. She reiterated that she was focussed in court on the main acts involving her private parts which were more sensitive for her, and that her memory of these other acts were now not clear.[^120] She also reiterated that she had been trying to forget; that she had been going for counselling to cope and was actually glad that she did not have to remember everything. J said that she was being truthful at all points, that since it was in her statement, she must have remembered it then, and that was why she stated it there, but that she did not remember it now.[^121] In response, the Defence submitted that it was objectively inconceivable that J could have forgotten such a significant detail.[^122] The Defence also submitted that the tongued/licked detail was in any event obviously physically impossible given the position she was apparently in, i.e. lying on her right side and facing the wall.[^123] All this indicated that J’s account was fiction.

77      **Exact sequence of actions after the molest on the 5** th **incident:** Under cross-examination, J reiterated that after the main acts of molest were over on the 5th incident, the Accused had _returned_ from the toilet to kiss her on her left cheek, and had also whispered that he loved her. However in J’s first statement (D6 at A9 on page 4), J said that the Accused had whispered those words to her _before_ leaving for the toilet. In her second statement (D7 at A4 on page 3), J indicated that the kiss took place _after_ the Accused returned from the toilet, but said she could not remember whether it was this same occasion when he had also whispered that he loved her; but she was sure that those words were whispered by him to her during one of the night incidents. When confronted with this, J conceded that she may have gotten the sequence wrong, but she remembers that the action of him kissing her and whispering those words to her did take place.[^124] During re-examination, J confirmed that after thinking about it, she was now sure that the Accused had whispered those words to her during the 5th incident.[^125] In response, the Defence submitted that the uncertainty of her account on this aspect was cause for grave concern because being kissed was one of the particulars stated in the 5th Charge, and that her uncertainty again indicated the artificiality in her account.[^126]

78      **Whether her breast was stroked skin-on-skin during the 6** th **incident:** Under cross-examination, J reiterated that the Accused had used his finger to stroke the side of her left breast, and that it was _skin on skin_. However in her second statement (D7 at A5 on page 3), J said that she felt “his finger stroking the side of my left breast from the _outside_ of my singlet”.[^127] When confronted with this, J acknowledged the difference and answered that the IO probably did not phrase her account accurately, and that the IO was perhaps trying to state that the Accused did not insert his finger inside her singlet.[^128] J maintained that the contact was skin on skin as the side of her left breast was accessible from outside her singlet. Even though this explanation coherently addressed the minor discrepancy, the Defence nonetheless submitted that J was being inconsistent and unworthy of credit.[^129]

79     I considered these differences carefully. I did so for each individually, and also reviewed if they collectively caused concern. I considered whether this complainant was indeed being untruthful, and was simply being caught out on aspects of her narrative. I acknowledged that J’s performance on the stand – if inadequate – potentially went towards supporting that Defence Case. I start with the materiality of the differences, and here only one of them objectively raised some concern: i.e. the inconsistency on whether she had been kissed by the Accused anywhere else. The difference could not have been more stark: her testimony that he did not, was contradicted by a most colourful account of him trying to force his tongue into her mouth, and him licking her ear. If J was an untruthful witness, then this was precisely the kind of dramatic difference which could potentially show her up. I observed her as learned Counsel capitalised on the difference and confronted her with it. In the end, J did not strike me as being untruthful. She readily conceded the difference and provided her answer for it. Objectively, the answer was substantively coherent: i.e. that she was focussed on the main acts of molest in the 6 incidents, and that she had been trying to forget the rest – which included this tongued/licked detail. J also said that she had been going for counselling to cope and was actually glad that she did not have to remember all the details of what happened to her. J then said that she was being truthful at all points, that since it was in her statement, she must have remembered it then, and that was why she stated it there, but that she did not remember it now. This answer was criticised by the Defence on two counts. First, that it was inconceivable that such a colourful detail could be forgotten, and second, that it was suspiciously convenient because there was no proof of trauma. The first criticism draws strength from the position that genuine sex assault victims will never forget – regardless of whether they want to or not – and that they will always be able to recount all the acts accurately no matter the passage of time. I could not agree with the assumed universality of that position for all sex assault victims. History and experience instead shows that the position is not tenable; victims can forget certain aspects, even colourful ones. This leads to the next connected matter which J spoke of, i.e. that she was focussed only on the main acts of molest in the 6 incidents, and that her memory of the other matters in the periphery was not as strong as she was trying to forget; they were painful and they preventing her from moving on. This explanation cohered with the broader explanation she gave when she was confronted about the 3 other incidents – which like this tongued/licked detail – also lay in the periphery beyond the 6 Charges. From that confused episode, it was apparent that J was indeed given the impression that only the actions stated in the 6 Charges were relevant to the trial, and that the other matters in the periphery were not. It was a year since her further statement D7, and coming to the trial as she did from that context, it no longer appeared that remarkable that she was not consciously trying to retain everything in memory and ‘wanted to forget’ those bits which were no longer required. I now turn to the next criticism that J’s explanation was convenient. In essence, the Defence’s objection here was the lack of proof about her supposed trauma. This was not strictly correct. J’s mother testified that J was crying when she came forward to tell her what happened; she also testified as to how difficult it was for J to address the specifics as to what happened to her, and how all of them ended up crying that night. All this indicated that J was experiencing trauma. J’s mother’s testimony corroborated J’s testimony on what happened that day when she finally came forward, and both accounts on this aspect were left unchallenged before me. Another related aspect of Mdm SLK’s testimony was about how she realised on hindsight that J’s behaviour towards the Accused had changed after 2010, where she appeared less warm towards the Accused.[^130] In those circumstances, J’s claim about her trauma therefore did not appear to be quite as fragile and without substance as the Defence contended.[^131]

80     The last criticism was that the alleged tongued action was physically impossible, and that it therefore showed that J had been making up the allegations all along. The Defence submitted that the Accused could not have bent and reached over to kiss and force his tongue into J’s mouth if she was lying down on her right side and facing the inner wall. I could not agree with this for two reasons. First, the distance involved is actually quite short, and given the size and height[^132] of the Accused, together with the size of the single bed involved, it was actually perfectly possible to have simply bent and reached over. A photo of a bed which was similar to the one which J used during that material period was admitted and marked as Exhibit P4. It confirms those observations. Second, the submission rested upon a false assumption: that J was still lying on her right side and facing the inner wall when the tongue action took place. An objective review of the notes will show that this aspect about her position was actually never stated because it was never explicitly covered during the cross-examination. In fact, there was no scope to cover it since J’s position at trial was that she no longer remembered this action. The submission therefore clearly rested on an assumption that her _usual_ position, i.e. of going to sleep on her right side and facing the inner wall, had remained her position when the tongue action took place. This was a false assumption because the evidence which was before the court instead showed that J moved during her sleep; J had testified on this[^133], and even the Defence had contended that was the case. There was therefore every possibility that when the tongue action took place, J had moved – either on her own or otherwise – and was no longer lying on her right side. If she was either supine or simply had her head turned to the left, the Defence Submission here would completely lose its basis.

81     Finally, I found the other differences to be minor in comparison, and they were also properly accounted for by J. Though she did waver on her memory about the sequence of events after the main acts of molest on the 5th incident, she did not waver on the fact that she was kissed on the 5th incident – that was the material particular in the Charge. Objectively, the only aspect that she did waver over was the sequence and whether he had whispered those words to her on that occasion. I noted that J did finally settle on a confirmed position. For similar reasons earlier cited, I accepted that this was just a memory lapse on a peripheral aspect, and that it was not necessarily indicative of anything more sinister. Given that there were credible and coherent explanations provided for the differences, I did not find any basis to conclude that J’s credit had been impeached.

### ■   That J’s Conduct after the Alleged Incidents was Incongruent:

82     The Defence next submitted that J’s conduct after the alleged incidents was incongruent with that of a victim who was in alleged trauma after the molests by her uncle. Whereas she claimed that she had ‘tried to avoid’ him after the incidents[^134], the Defence pointed out that the evidence instead showed that she had continued to stay in touch with the Accused via SMS and on Facebook, even initiating contact on occasions, and being clearly affectionate in some of those messages.[^135] The Accused also highlighted that J did not resist meeting him in Kuala Lumpur (“KL”) in December 2010, and that he was in fact even invited by J to attend at her school awards ceremony sometime at the end of 2011.[^136] I recognised the intuitive appeal of this submission, and I considered it carefully. The submission here was related to the one made earlier about the “computer desk incident” being a clear warning sign, and that J’s behaviour in continuing to be close to the Accused after that was simply incongruent. For this submission to succeed, its basis must be absolutely sound. In this case, its basis rested on the notion that victims of sexual offences will _always_ react with repulsion to the prospect of having any further dealings with their abuser. That is an imprecise notion because not all victims react that way to their abuser, and therein lies the flaw in the submission. Victim psychology is complicated, and reactions do not always conform to classical notions. Reactions to their abuser are often influenced by, amongst others, self-awareness, maturity, nature of their relationship, and the gravity of the act. The submission fails to take any of that into proper account; that the alleged perpetrator in this case stood in the position of a closely trusted adult in a familial setting to a young inexperienced complainant. J herself testified as much, stating that the Accused was actually her much loved and trusted uncle, one who had spent much time with her, playing with her, and taking care of her – both physically and academically – since young. Some childish notes penned by J for the Accused, and some photos of her with him when she was much younger all confirm this, i.e. that the Accused was a person to whom she had been accustomed and conditioned from a young age (and over an extended period) to trust.[^137] Not only that, it was also apparent that a large part of J’s self-image and identity took alignment from the presence and involvement of the Accused. It was therefore not entirely realistic to expect a young person in that situation to easily just react with repulsion and cut off the perpetrator entirely. Cutting off ties would have meant significant isolation, having one’s being, identity and sense of self-worth untethered, and losing not just all the bad, but also all the good that the person represented. J was pressed hard on this during cross-examination, and I saw her coherently account for why she continued to act normally after the incidents. She made no attempt to deny or play down her behaviour towards the Accused. She explained that the Accused had showed her more concern and affection than her own parents, that she understood things differently when she was younger, and was in denial about what he had done to her. She said she thought she could just ignore what he had done to her in the past, and just move on and have a normal life.[^138] She said she wanted her life to be normal, and that she did not want to worry her parents, and so she pretended – like the Accused – that nothing bad had happened, and that he was still her much loved and trusted uncle.[^139] She thought pretending would fix everything and said that life felt more normal by pretending, and that it felt horrible to face what he had done to her, as if she was used like a prostitute and that she felt very disgusted and very dirty.[^140] A talk in Secondary 4 about “Saving Yourself for Marriage” made it more difficult to continue pretending, and the flashbacks and nightmares became more frequent.[^141] She was however concerned because she did not have any evidence, and so she kept pretending till she could pretend no more during JC1.[^142] J also said that she ‘blames herself for being so stupid and foolish’ for keeping it to herself, for not telling her parents, and for not confronting him earlier – becoming emotional as she testified on this (but again pressing on to offer her testimony without a break).[^143] I found J’s responses here to be entirely coherent. When one takes all of that into consideration, the fact that J continued keeping in touch with the Accused and pretending as if nothing bad had happened did not necessarily therefore indicate falsity in her allegations.

83     That said, the various interactions were also reviewed to see if they painted a plainly contradictory picture. The KL trip took place in December 2010, about 3 months after the Accused had moved out. That short 3 day trip was organised by J’s Aunt S who brought her daughter SV (J’s cousin) and J along. Whilst there, Aunt S arranged the meeting with the Accused. During those few hours, they did some sight seeing before having a meal together. They then went their separate ways.[^144] Whilst the Accused contended that J was very happy to see him, there was nothing about that particular episode which appeared conclusive of the Defence Case. The same observation applies for their next interaction at J’s school awards ceremony about a year later in end 2011 when nothing remarkable actually happened.[^145] Turning to the various text messages, they were also carefully reviewed. The list of messages was forensically retrieved and were thus presumably complete. They were introduced by the Defence into evidence as Exhibits D1 and D2 – those reports also incorporate the select few messages which the Accused produced to the first IO earlier in P10. I reviewed them all. In total, the messages span a one and a half year period from 17 March 2011 to 4 Sept 2012 – the period prior, i.e. from Oct 2010 when the Accused moved out till March 2011 was unaccounted for.[^146] In total, there were 32 messages sent to the Accused during that period, and 11 were clearly from J. The number of distinct occasions where J _initiated_ contact for anything other than routine mundane matters numbered just three (details set out below). The other 8 text messages were _responses_ from J on various matters. Numerically at least, three occasions over a year and a half period certainly did not seem to be a suspiciously high figure. Turning to the content of those messages, the Defence cited the following as being indicative of their case:

> I.     On 8 Aug 2011, J initiated contact with a SMS from her own handphone:

>> “_Hey shu shu can you buy me the sweet : wrigleys EXTRA professional mints.? Berry flavour. The one I showed you. I ate finish le… Can buy it for me pls?”[^147]_

> II.     On 16 Nov 2011, J responded to the Accused’s SMS that he would call the J household on a later date:

>> “_Need to wait so long. I miss you la hehe…..!:)”_

>> And to which the Accused quickly responded with: “_Ok miss u too <3_”[^148]

> III.     On 13 Dec 2011, J initiated contact via Facebook:

>> “_Happy belated birthday Shu Shu! I was working yesterday :(:( Last thing when are you calling me? -.-”_

> IV.     On 15 Mar 2012, J’s brother initiated contact with this:

>> “_Hi phon , how’s life :) baby ho find you:)”_

> And to which the Accused responded a few minutes later with:

>> “_This few week have some activities:-P see u in april:-)”_

> V.     On 24 May 2012, J responded to the Accused’s SMS about an upcoming lunch appointment:

>> “_Vivo city crystal jade! I want to eat :) shu shu I want:)”_

> And to which the Accused responded a minute later with:

>> “_U think I win to to there r six of us le.”_

> And to which J responded a minute later with:

>> “_Don’t wan!!!_”

> VI.     On 26 May 2012 (being the day of the scheduled lunch appointment), J initiated contact:

>> _“9 am Ah ok? See you shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu shu”_

84     For a proper interpretation, those emoji laden messages must all be read in their context. They show friendly casual banter, and the responses from the Accused were often sweet tongued and playful. Objectively, I agreed that these messages were possibly indicative of the Defence Case. The child like language used by J did indeed show that she missed her uncle, and that she did look forward to seeing him again. Whilst they did give cause for pause, I did not however think that they were so clear as to exclude all other possibilities and permit only the interpretation pursued by the Defence Case.[^149] An objective reading of them would conclude that one could not entirely rule out the possibility that these were sent by a conflicted young girl (J was 15-16 years old when those messages were sent) who was trying to pretend that everything was normal in her life. In fact, it is not uncommon to encounter such reactions: presenting a normal exterior demeanour is sometimes a defence mechanism invoked to distance oneself from the reality of the trauma from the abuse.[^150] This was something which J herself said: that it felt more normal to pretend than to face the reality of the abuse.[^151] Therefore, given the lack of certainty as to what these messages indicated, I therefore could not entirely agree with the Defence’s submission here.

### ■   That J’s Evidence was Illogical:

85     The Defence next submitted that there were 4 other aspects of J’s evidence which were illogical, and that they thus indicated the artificiality in her account. I now detail these aspects and my findings on them.

86      **The Blanket:** the Defence highlighted J’s claim that she slept with a blanket on, but that she had made no mention of the blanket being removed on any of the night incidents when she was allegedly molested. The Defence claimed this was a curious omission of a significant detail, and that it was cause for doubt over her account.[^152] I did not think so because the clear implication from J’s testimony was that the blanket – like her clothes – had been removed. An objective reading of the notes will show that there was no ambiguity on this aspect, and that there was no curious omission in her account.

87      **The identification of Ms PMF:** the Defence highlighted that J’s claim of never having met Ms PMF, i.e. the girlfriend of the Accused, was suspicious and that her refusal to even acknowledge Ms PMF in court indicated the animosity she had against Ms PMF because Ms PMF represented the rival who had won over the attention and affections of her beloved uncle. The Defence also submitted that J’s position was also clearly inconsistent with the evidence from J’s own mother: that Ms PMF was indeed brought by the Accused to their home, and that Ms PMF was introduced to their family – J included.[^153] I could not agree with these submissions. The first submission rested on an entirely exaggerated interpretation of events in court. The identification episode is captured in the NE at day 1, page 69: J was on the witness stand, and the Defence orchestrated the identification exercise by arranging for Ms PMF to be brought into court for J to see if she could identify her. After Ms PMF moved into position next to the dock (which was to the left of where J was), learned Counsel started the exercise in the following terms: “_Ms J, look at her, don’t turn away._” Those three words at the end from Counsel form the only terms in the notes which purport to indicate that J was loath to even look at Ms PMF. My observations of that episode actually did not coincide with the Defence’s submission. Prior to that point, J was facing towards her right side in the direction of the bench as she offered her testimony.[^154] That orientation was the norm, and I observed that she appeared to be consciously keeping that position – avoiding eye contact with the Accused in the dock on her left. J later also went on to explain that the experience of having to testify ‘in close-proximity with the Accused was stressful, tiring and uncomfortable’ for her.[^155] The identification exercise of Ms PMF involved J looking over towards the dock where the Accused was – something which J had been avoiding. When Counsel prompted her in those terms, J actually did look over at Ms PMF as instructed. Though J did not linger in her gaze in that direction, it certainly did not come across that it was because J was reluctant to acknowledge her Ms PMF because the latter was her rival, and not because there was some other reason. In my judgment, the Defence submission here was simply reading too much into the situation, and it was an absolute stretch to conclude from that little episode that it showed J’s animosity against Ms PMF (and by extension, her inappropriate fondness for the Accused). Next, I also did not think there was basis to take objection to J’s answer that she had ‘no impression of having met Ms PMF’ just because her mother had confirmed that Ms PMF was the same one who was introduced to them in 2012. If J’s mother remembered Ms PMF, I could not see how that provided any basis to question J’s credibility. If one examines the testimony about the events, it will show that J only had a very brief interaction with Ms PMF during the introduction, whereas J’s mother spent much more time socialising and speaking with Ms PMF on that day. In those circumstances, it should not surprise that the depth of their impressions about Ms PMF would end up being very different as a result. Finally, when J was later questioned by Counsel on why her interactions with Ms PMF were so brief on that day, J replied that she was simply shy. The Defence submitted that this answer – which appeared to acknowledge that she _did_ meet Ms PMF in 2012, was inconsistent with her earlier answer that she had no impression of the Ms PMF in court. This submission was as flawed as it was mischievous because it clearly attempts to completely misinterpret J’s earlier answer. The three submissions were therefore all rejected.

88      **That J woke to her mother’s voice:** the Defence highlighted that J’s claim of having woken up when she heard her mother’s voice confronting the Accused was illogical because she had earlier claimed that she was a heavy sleeper during that period who could even sleep through thunder. I could not agree with this submission because it failed to have regard to the other testimony from J as to what she was also trying to do during that period. Whilst J did indeed say that she was a heavy sleeper during that exam period, she also said that she was on high alert after the first incident and had tried to stay up during the night to protect herself. Additionally, J’s mother also said that she had exclaimed “in a high volume” when she confronted the Accused. If one takes all of that into account, plus the fact that the transition from wakefulness to slumber is a process and not an instant, then there was nothing inherently illogical about J’s account. The Defence next submitted that J’s claim about the Accused having removed his hand from her shorts on being confronted was also not credible because J’s mother saw no such thing.[^156] I could not accept this submission either because it rested on the false assumption that J’s mother could see what was happening. There were reasons to doubt that was possible. First, J was sleeping on the lower covered bunk and it was an accepted fact that her bed area was dimly lit even with the night light on.[^157] Second, with the Accused at J’s bedside, and with J’s mother positioned at his back at the doorway along the corridor outside, there was every possibility that his body position had obscured what he was doing with his hand; an examination of the sketch plan in Exhibit P1 (which shows the important general orientation, even if it was not exact to scale), and the photos of the similar bunk bed in Exhibits P4 and P5 would confirm this. There was thus no inconsistency here.

89      **That J’s testimony was illogical given the Accused’s sweaty hands:** the Defence highlighted that J’s account of the sensations she felt during the incidents was contradicted by the clear medical evidence of the extreme palmar hyperhidrosis suffered by the Accused.[^158] The Prosecution’s response on this point was to throw doubt on whether the Accused had this condition at the material time. I did not find that response particularly useful because 1. the testimony from the doctor, the mother, the sister, and the girlfriend of the Accused all indicated otherwise, and 2. the Prosecution could have presumably rebutted this by checking with J and her mother about their observations of his hands, and recalled them to rebut this aspect if necessary, but didn’t. Indeed, the undisputed evidence about how close they were indicated that J would definitely have known about the sweaty hands of the Accused – a point which is graphically confirmed in the photos at page 6 of P10. I therefore accepted that the Accused did suffer from this condition at the material time. I then reviewed the complained evidence of J again. The relevant part is captured in her evidence-in-chief in the NE on day 1 at page 19. The Defence homed in on the word “dry” which J used in her testimony to describe the feeling of his hands. I could not accept the Defence submission because it was plainly apparent from the context that J was using the word “dry” in contra indication to the “wet” feeling she felt when she was licked at her private parts. Even if one was wrong to interpret J in that manner, and if J was indeed being literal, it was entirely possible that the Accused could have wiped his hands against himself, his clothes, or the bedding in J’s room before he touched her, and J was describing that initial feeling. Anyway, this aspect of J’s testimony was, somewhat strategically, left unclarified by the Defence. It was strategic in that it afforded the possibility of an interpretation which favoured the Defence, but at the same time, given that it remained unclarified, one could not rule out the other possibilities either. There was therefore no basis to conclude that this aspect of her account was indeed illogical.

## Findings of J as a Witness:

90     After reviewing all the Defence submissions about J’s testimony, I found the criticisms were actually not made out. They were all individually flawed for the reasons set out earlier. In the end, I found J’s account had not only remained clear, complete and consistent, it also remained internally coherent after all the questioning.

91     The next step I took was to examine whether the submissions made any difference cumulatively. This involved taking a step back to review whether the entire picture presented by J still made for a coherent whole. This holistic review is important because one area in isolation may not seem significant on its own, but it may gain significance when seen in the overall context of all the other potential areas of concern.

92     The Defence also made the point that there is sometimes an unconscious sympathy bias at play whenever there is a young vulnerable looking complainant with a story of woe to tell.[^159] I recognised that had to be guarded against. I was also conscious that J was one who was, by her own admission, quite adept at presenting a front before others for an extended period.[^160] All this reinforced the point about looking beyond demeanour. I therefore considered whether there was objectively a possibility that this was indeed a witness who was – as the Defence contended – trying to keep to the false story that she offered up 3 years earlier to the police because she was angry at her uncle for failing to pay her the attention and affection which she craved from him after he got himself a new girlfriend. That her inability to remember the details of her narrative (i.e. on the tossed and turned incident, the tongued/licked action, and the sequence in the 5th incident) was indicative of her simply losing track of a tale because it was not grounded on fact. That her narrative rang hollow with 3 identical incidents (i.e. the 2nd, 3rd and 4th incidents) which indicated a lack of imagination on her part. That it was telling that the Prosecution had even chosen not to include the tongued/licked aspect into the 3rd Charge. That there were patent credibility issues in her narrative, e.g. of being able to wake to her mother’s voice, and of her incongruent warm behaviour towards the Accused despite the alleged trauma from the abuse. These were the strongest points in summary, but all the rest were also considered. Ultimately, the evidence provides the answer as to whether this was a credible possibility. In that regard, I could find nothing in the evidence elicited under cross-examination from J which showed that her affections for her uncle had actually crossed over into inappropriate territory. All the Defence provided – including the testimony of the Accused himself – was that J loved the Accused as an uncle, and there was objectively nothing beyond that. In effect, the Defence position on this actually coincided with J’s own early admission, and there was nothing additional to show that J was the infatuated, unbalanced, possessive, jealous, angry, and ultimately vengeful teenager. With that as the foundation, everything else in the Defence Case about J was essentially a theoretical submission, one which invited the court to interpret J’s testimony in a strained manner. I say strained because there was actually a credible explanation in evidence for every single point listed above about her evidence.[^161] Beyond those points, J also substantively addressed the Defence Case about her head-on: she stated that she did not love the Accused in a romantic sense, and was not jealous of Ms PMF. To substantiate this, J indicated that she knew he had girlfriends before – a fact which was not contested[^162], and which was also corroborated by J’s mother[^163] – and J highlighted that she did not take objection to his having girlfriends, and had in fact even helped make suggestions on what gifts he ought to get for them.[^164] J therefore denied that she had that outburst at Aunt S’s house against Ms PMF – simply because there was no reason for her to feel that way about Ms PMF. J also stated that she was not triggered into a false complaint over a pair of shoes, and flatly denied the outburst he claimed she had when he came back to collect his mail – her testimony about these two supposed outbursts was also corroborated by her mother who testified that she saw no such outbursts from J. All considered, I did not find any reason to objectively doubt J’s account, and there were no kinks in her testimony which indicated an ulterior motive. There were instead reasons to doubt the coherence of the Defence Case about J having an ulterior motive. If this complainant was indeed possessed of a vengeful motive, she could have easily avoided identical incidents and just crafted a simpler and more damning account against the Accused, e.g. that she felt penetration, or that she felt him touching her before her mother came and caught him in her room. J could have said any or all of those obvious points to present a stronger case, but didn’t – and that did not sit well with the Defence Case about her being the intelligent but scheming little niece. In the end, despite the robust cross-examination, her core account as presented in court remained consistent and unshaken. There was demonstrable depth because coherent details were offered up on all the peripheral areas probed; those details also remained consistent under questioning. J also coherently accounted for aspects of her previous statements which initially appeared contradictory. Therefore, in terms of the substantive content and form (i.e. the manner in which it was delivered), there was nothing in J’s testimony which raised any concern over its credibility.

## Supportive Evidence - Mdm SLK:

93     There was supportive evidence to J’s complaint, and they came from two sources: one was Mdm SLK, J’s mother, and the other was from the Accused, which I will explain later. For Mdm SLK, although she was J’s mother, I found Mdm SLK to be a straight talking witness. For instance, during her evidence-in-chief, she said that she had seen the Accused hug J at her shoulders, and when asked if she had seen the Accused hug her daughter anywhere else, Mdm SLK simply answered “No”. Mdm SLK could have offered a more clearly implicatory answer to support her daughter, but didn’t. This showed the objectivity she brought to the proceedings. There was also reason to believe that Mdm SLK had a good prior relationship with the Accused. This was apparent from the testimony of the Accused himself where he was effusive on how much he respected Mdm SLK.[^165] This was also apparent from the messages in D2, where the messages between the Accused and Mdm SLK showed that they kept in regular contact after he moved out, and that they supported each other (e.g. in the sale of CNY goodies[^166] and the purchase of various other items[^167]). They were close enough for her to even offer procreation advice to the Accused in May 2012.[^168] Like the responses used by the Accused with J, his responses to Mdm SLK were also sweet tongued and playful, for instance on Wednesday 23 May 2012, Mdm SLK messaged the Accused “_Confirm Sunday go dim sum with us right_” and the Accused replying a few minutes later in Mandarin characters to say “_That is correct Your Highness :-D_”.[^169] That term of endearment was distinct from the “_Little Princess_” term he reserved for J. All this indicated that Mdm SLK and the Accused had a good prior relationship. Coupled with the fact that there was no evidence to indicate that she had anything personal against the Accused, all this augered well for her objectivity as a witness. There was also one more reason to believe in her objectivity: she said that J did not tell her in the end all the details about what the Accused had allegedly done to her – see paragraph 18 above. This meant that Mdm SLK could not really form her own judgment on the matter, and was simply taking J at her word, and allowing the investigative process to determine the appropriate result.

94     With that context, I found the testimony which Mdm SLK offered to that process to be entirely supportive of the Prosecution’s Case. There were three main aspects.[^170] First, she confirmed that she did find the Accused at J’s bedside touching/stroking J’s head in the middle of the night during the material period, and that she did loudly ask him to leave the room. Second, she confirmed that J was crying when she finally came forward to tell her some years later about what the Accused had done to her. Third, she confirmed as well that on hindsight, there was a change in J’s behaviour from 2010 onwards, a change which saw J being ‘very stressed and not happy’ and which also saw her behaviour towards the Accused cool. The first two aspects were unchallenged, and though the third was scrutinised in cross-examination, Mdm SLK was able to provide specifics in justification.[^171] I therefore accepted Mdm SLK’s testimony on those aspects, and found that they coherently painted a picture which supported the allegations from J. I reached this conclusion even though Mdm SLK’s account of what she saw the Accused doing to J in the middle of the night differed slightly from J’s own testimony of what she felt the Accused was doing. As explained earlier at paragraph 88, I found that the difference was accountable to the different perspectives each had that night, but that the main points about that encounter otherwise matched up.

95     Mdm SLK also managed to shed light on two key supposed events in the Defence Case: the outburst against Ms PMF which J apparently had at Aunt S’s house in 2012, and the outburst which J apparently had against the Accused at their own home in May 2013 over the latter’s failure to buy her the expensive pair of shoes. According to the Defence Case, Mdm SLK was present on both occasions and had witnessed the outbursts. When questioned on them, Mdm SLK confirmed that she was present on those occasions, but said that there were no such outbursts[^172] – effectively refuting the central plank in the Defence’s Case that J was possessed of a vengeful motive. I found no reason to doubt Mdm SLK’s answers here. There was nothing to indicate that she knew how these events featured in the Defence Case, and the potential significance of her answers either way on them. I observed her as she addressed them in her plain speaking manner, and given the observations earlier about her objectivity, I accepted her evidence on these aspects. Her evidence here corroborated the evidence from J that there were no such outbursts from her.

96     At the end of the review of the Prosecution’s Case, I found it to be clear, complete, and coherent. The evidence of the complainant on her core account remained consistent, and there was also supportive contextual evidence from her mother. It was also externally consistent with the undisputed facts. The Defence Submissions about the Prosecution’s evidence were all considered, but found to be flawed. The final step was to examine if the evidence offered up by the Defence raised a reasonable doubt.

## A Contrived Defence:

97     The Accused offered up a patently doubtful account, and he did so in a most unconvincing manner. Only one area of his testimony survived scrutiny, i.e. his claim that he suffered from severe palmar hyperhidrosis at the material time. As indicated earlier, I accepted the evidence presented by the Defence on that aspect. The rest of his testimony was found to be suspect and did not survive the scrutiny of cross-examination.

### ■   An Incoherent Account on How and Why he Entered J’s Bedroom at Night:

98     To recap, the Accused said he would check in on J in the middle of the night out of concern. Whilst that appeared coherent given his undisputed status in the home as the close and concerned uncle, his testimony about how he went about it was instead quite artificial. He portrayed that he always entered J’s bedroom with her seeming acknowledgment and consent, obtained by him calling out to her if she was ok from the corridor doorway and him entering her bedroom only when she acknowledged that call. The difficulty with that testimony was that it appeared incoherent with his stated purpose: if he was really concerned about J being able to get a good night’s rest because he knew that she was stressed out by her exams, then there was really no reason for him to rouse her from her sleep by calling out to her like that. If he was really being the concerned uncle, he could have just quietly checked on her – just like what Mdm SLK did. Even though his actions made no apparent sense, the Accused tried to explain it in his evidence-in-chief that it was ‘better that way’. The artificiality of the account about how and why he entered J’s bedroom at night became apparent during cross-examination when he became argumentative and defensive as he was quizzed on the seeming incoherence of his actions. In the end, no cogent justifications were ultimately offered and it remained as a “courtesy” and his “practice”.[^173] The inability to account for this basic aspect raised concerns on whether this was an instance of the Accused being caught out on an improperly thought through constructed account. It appeared as if the Accused was anxious to depict that he somehow had licence/permission from J to be at her bedside in the middle of the night, and that he actually had a sense of propriety about such matters. Even that claim appeared doubtful when one considers that he had to be told by Mdm SLK that his physical behaviour with J had to change because she was getting older and had reached puberty – evidence which was conceded and undisputed before me.[^174]

### ■   The Changing & Uncertain Account on What he did in J’s Bedroom at Night:

99     The Accused initially offered up specific testimony about two occasions when he entered J’s bedroom in the night. After describing what happened on each occasion, he later contradicted himself by stating that they were actually the same occasion. His testimony about having kissed J on her _right_ thigh during that singular occasion also later unconvincingly changed to the other thigh instead. All this happened in his evidence-in-chief itself (see paragraphs 24-28 above), and it did not inspire confidence in the veracity of his testimony. During cross-examination, the number of occasions which he remembered having entered J’s bedroom at night _tripled_. From the singular occasion when he was caught by Mdm SLK inside, he now offered up two other prior occasions: once where he heard a noise coming from J and so he went in to check on her[^175], and the other was when he again heard J muttering something in her dreams and so he again went in to check on her[^176]. A growing and changing account like that raised concerns over its credibility. It was also remarkable that he could even remember those occasions at all since both were – unlike the occasion when Mdm SLK caught him inside – rather unremarkable in comparison. This is especially since the Defence Case would have us believe that he moved out in October 2010 under happy circumstances, and was only made to address his mind to those events in 2009 when he was arrested – effectively about 4 years would have already passed on those seemingly mundane events. There was reason to doubt that he really did remember these occasions because when he was cross-examined on them, he could hardly stay consistent on the details about what he heard, at which point he heard them, what he said/did, what he observed about J in response, and what exactly he did inside. At one point, the three occasions seemed to grow to 4.[^177] The thigh kissing incident was also moved from the third occasion to the second, before being lost as he could no longer remember which occasion it happened, and finally reappearing in the second occasion.[^178]All this is captured in the notes for days 7 to 9, and it makes for laborious reading because the Accused was being argumentative and guarded by providing numerous ambiguous responses on his position. That stance was telling since this was seemingly about inconsequential events. The uncertainty of it all did not impress, and it raised concerns about the credibility of his claims here. This Accused was trying to peddle a story to show that he had ‘reason’ for being present in J’s bedroom at night, and that his actions there were always innocuous, but he was having tremendous difficulty pulling it off on the details.

### ■   The Distinct Lack of Evidence about J’s Supposed Motive:

100    I had noted this earlier. After the Accused testified, the only evidence about J’s supposed motive against him was his testimony about her two outbursts. Apart from that, there was actually nothing else in the evidence about J’s behaviour which could distinctly show that J’s affections for him had crossed over from close and trusting niece, into inappropriately fantasizing and possessive niece. Apart from that, the Accused also provided nothing to show that the 17 year old J had a mean streak about her such that she was indeed capable of such viciousness against him by launching this false complaint.

101    To recap, I rejected the testimony about the two outbursts. Both were completely contradicted by Mdm SLK – whom I found to be a reliable witness on the matter. The testimony about the second outburst was also worryingly uncertain. For instance, the Accused wavered from being “very sure” that D was not present, to subsequently stating that D was actually “in the vicinity”.[^179] This about turn took place when the Accused was confronted with his own cautioned statement which claimed that Mdm SLK _and D_ were potential witnesses to the outburst by J over the shoes (see page 4 of Exhibit D8). It appeared that the Accused was putting forth a tenuous basis in a desperate attempt to find a way to discredit J.

### ■   The Flawed Supporting Evidence:

102    I digress at this point to address the related evidence from Ms PMF. In gist, Ms PMF testified that J appeared to have animosity towards her. This was presumably on account of J’s jealousy because Ms PMF represented the rival who had won over the affections of her beloved uncle. Ms PMF’s evidence here was the only evidence called by the Defence to support the central plank in its case that the allegations by J were false and born of jealousy and anger. Ms PMF’s testimony about J’s supposed animosity was grounded in two areas. The first was J’s cold reception towards her at their first meeting in 2012, and the second was J’s cold reception towards her in court. Objectively, both consisted of Ms PMF’s reading/interpretation of J’s behaviour at the two occasions. Interpretations of demeanour are not always reliable. Based on my observations of what actually happened in the court room (as set out in paragraph 87 above), I could not accept Ms PMF’s testimony that J “did not even look at me” and “refused to look at me always”, before concluding that J was “pretending not to know me”. Ms PMF’s eagerness to reach that far in her testimony was cause for concern. It appeared that Ms PMF was only too ready to take sides and exaggerate that episode, and infer animosity. Her objectivity was thus in doubt. Even Ms PMF’s evidence about what happened outside the court room appeared to be lacking in coherence: she said that J “deliberately did not want to look at me” outside the court room because J “turned her head to stare at me for a moment in a very quick manner”. If Ms PMF was using the same lens to interpret her first encounter with J in 2012, then there was similar reason to be concerned about the reliability of her conclusion that J’s apparent coldness was born of jealousy and anger, and not simply because of social shyness from a 15+ year old that she was meeting for the first time (that was J’s evidence on the matter).

### ■   An Impeached Defence:

103    Returning to the testimony of the Accused, the final area of concern was the fact that his defence version presented in court turned out to be different from the earlier versions he had given previously to the police. In total, there were three iterations. The first was in his long statement (Exhibit P6) which was recorded from him on the day of his arrest in 2013; and where he entered a partial admission of having “_move my hand down and press her breast from outside her clothing about 2 to 3 times_” and that he did “_kiss her buttock_” and that all this happened “_about 2 to 3 times_” at night when she was sleeping.[^180] He denied doing anything more than that, and rationalised that he did it because he and J were actually “very close”.[^181] He also surmised that J was making up the complaint because she was angry with him over his failure to buy her an expensive pair of shoes. This partial admission was then resiled from in his second version which he provided in his cautioned statements to the Charges (Exhibit D8). Those statements were recorded from him about 2 years later in 2015. In those statements, he flatly denied the molests and reiterated that J was angry with him over his failure to buy her the expensive shoes – which was, as indicated earlier, supposedly witnessed by Mdm SLK and D. This time, the Accused also raised a new point to justify his denials: that the molests were impossible because J’s room door was “always locked”, a claim which he repeated 5 times. There was notably no mention about J’s jealous motive – a surprising omission since this was a central part of the defence ultimately pursued. That came only in the 3rd version which he provided as his court testimony. In the 3rd version, he abandoned the ‘locked door’ excuse, and provided the flawed and uncertain account (as recounted above) about what he was supposedly doing in J’s room at night. Given this context about how this Accused was materially changing his position on his defence over time, and that the version being presented in court was only recently arrived at, there was reason to be concerned about its credibility. When the Accused was questioned on all this, he conceded that the previous statements were voluntary but provided a most unconvincing explanation as to why they should be disregarded. He raised a host of dubious and inconsistent details about how P6 was recorded, but in essence alleged that the first IO who recorded P6 was biased against him. All his claims were refuted by the IO when he took the stand in rebuttal. I found SSSgt Lim to be a credible witness of truth.[^182] Though there were some procedural discrepancies – which he candidly admitted – SSSgt Lim remained steadfast that all the content in P6 came from the Accused.[^183] As for the cautioned statements, the Accused uttered some incoherent explanation referencing some other irrelevant time period, before finally rationalising that they should be disregarded simply because they were inaccurate as he spoke too quickly and was tired and anxious.[^184] I found that this Accused was making up his answers as he went along, and that there was no credibility in either of his attempts to downplay the fact that he had been inconsistent throughout in stating his position.

104    Taking the totality of what was going on with this Accused, I could not accept any of his explanations and found him completely unworthy of credit. I rejected his testimony as a result. Save for his claim that he had sweaty palms during that period, the rest of his account was contrived, delivered without any conviction, and it did not survive the scrutiny of cross-examination because numerous inconsistencies and coherence issues were ultimately laid bare. It was also shown to be a relatively recent invention. In the circumstances, I found no reasonable doubt raised. The partial admission recorded in P6 – whilst substantively inaccurate on part of the details, the fact of it having been entered by the Accused, in a manner where there was broad alignment with the complaints against him (i.e. that he had entered J’s bedroom at night whilst she and the others were sleeping in order to touch her private parts) served to bolster J’s overall credibility that she was indeed a victim of his sexual abuse.

## Conclusion:

105    After a complete review of all the evidence, I found J to have been an utterly credible witness and that her testimony met the requisite standard. I had explained earlier why the substance of her testimony was credible. I would only add this point: that I found J to have been an earnest witness on the stand, one for whom the subject matter was palpably difficult for her to address. With the evidence stacked as it was, I found the 6 Charges proven beyond a reasonable doubt. I delivered brief grounds at the time, and I now reiterate the relevant portion:

> “The guilt or innocence of this accused turns on a finding of fact by the court. There were only two broad possibilities as to what happened in this case: either he is indeed the uncle who succumbed to his lustful desires and molested his young niece in the middle of the night (save for the last incident); or this was a young lady who was a seasoned liar with a false tale against her once close uncle because he had started to shower less attention on her. Both sides have offered up their evidence on these possibilities, and I have considered them very carefully. The standards of review required are clear, and having undertaken that exercise, I find that this young lady was no malicious thespian as claimed and that the evidence in relation to her alleged motives was quite doubtful. Instead, I find her and her testimony to be entirely credible: it was clear, coherent, complete, and remained consistent on the material points under questioning. Whilst it was not entirely blemish free, credible explanations were proffered for those parts. I note as well that this was not entirely a case of one person’s word against the other either: when this accused was picked up for questioning on those allegations from the girl, he himself offered up an incriminating statement of sorts: i.e. of having done certain things to the girl. Though those admissions were not complete, they nonetheless worked to support the Prosecution’s Case against him. At the same time, they also contradicted the case which the defence itself had originally put forth. This accused tried to reason himself out of those statements, and I found those explanations entirely doubtful and his credibility was impeached as a result. I have no hesitation dismissing the Defence Case. Upon a complete review of the evidence, I found the charges to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and I do hereby find the accused guilty and convict him on all the 6 charges.”

## Prescribed Penalties:

106    The first 5 Charges under section 354(2) of the Penal Code, being offences which involve a victim under the age of 14 years, each carry penalties which may extend to 5 years imprisonment, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

107    The last Charge under section 354(1) of the Penal Code carries a penalty which may extend to 2 years imprisonment, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments.

## Mitigation:

108    The Accused was untraced.

109    The Defence, having already determined to contest the conviction, entered a brief mitigation. The relevant portion read:

> “_In line with the totality principle and proportionality, it is respectfully submitted that the Accused be sentenced to no more than 48 months imprisonment with 8 strokes of the cane.”[^185]_

110    This position changed after the Prosecution filed its submissions on sentence seeking a much higher term. Leave was granted for the Defence to address the points made by the Prosecution, and the Defence subsequently filed its submissions on sentence on 30 April 2018, stating that a fair aggregate sentence would be _45 months imprisonment with 22 strokes of the cane_.[^186] The Defence contended that the present case fell within Band 2 of the sentencing framework set out in _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span>.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence:

111    The Prosecution sought an aggregate sentence of _not less than 8.5 years imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane_. The following factors were cited in justification:

> ■    There was a high degree of pre-meditation and planning in the offences. Committed under the cloak of darkness whilst everyone was asleep in the flat.

> ■    There was abuse of trust. He used the opportunities to be alone with the victim and used her to satiate his lust. He did so when J was at her most vulnerable, and in the place where she was entitled to let her guard down.

> ■    The acts of molest were extremely intrusive and degrading, “just one step short of rape”.[^187] They were skin on skin, involved her most private parts, and exposed her to potential diseases when he licked her there and rubbed his penis there.

> ■    Abuse took place over a 4 month period, and left the victim scarred – she broke down no less than 4 times during cross-examination. She also had to seek counselling. Her Victim Impact Statement indicated that she was feeling depressed, had suicidal thoughts, unstable emotions, still suffered nightmares and flash backs, was withdrawn from social life, and was now fearful of men.

> ■    No remorse. Disparaged J’s character during the trial by imputing a jealousy motive.

112    The Prosecution contended that these factors brought the offences into the middle to upper range of the most serious Band 3 in the _GBR_ sentencing framework. No post _GBR_ cases were however cited to support this.

## Sentence:

113    Before me, the parties were agreed that the _GBR_ sentencing framework provided authoritative guidance. They were however divided on which Band the case fell into. I determined that the case fell into the middle to the upper range of Band 2. This was largely in line with the Defence’s submissions which I found to be quite fair and measured. It was however substantively different from the Prosecution’s – which is appealing against the sentence. For that reason, I propose to make clear where I diverged from the Prosecution’s assessment.

114    After reviewing the Prosecution’s submissions, I agreed that the factors listed were all relevant to sentencing, but there was one area of divergence. Whilst the acts of molest were indeed serious and highly intrusive, I could not agree that they were “just one step short of rape”. That was elevating the present case too far. In all objectivity, if the step analogy is to be retained, then the difference between the present offences and a case of rape meant that they were effectively on different floors altogether. It was wrong to use rape to bookend the proposed sentence in this case. Doing that distorts the perspective as to where this case should stand. Perhaps that was why the Prosecution saw it fit to suggest an aggregate of 8.5 years imprisonment, with the strokes of the cane maxed out at 24 strokes – that aggregate was significantly above the maximum sentence possible for a single offence under s 354(2) of the Penal Code. When one remembers that the maximum sentence is _usually_ reserved for the most egregious offending imaginable under that provision (e.g. the outrage of modesty was sadistic, depraved, and visited with fear and violence to coerce an especially vulnerable/mentally challenged/very young victim – all of which were absent here), then the correct perspective ought to return.

115    Nothing I said in the preceding paragraph should be understood though as an attempt to belittle the actions of the Accused – they were and remain serious offending which should be visited with “grave and unrelenting disapprobation”.[^188] I held that deterrence and retribution were the primary sentencing considerations.[^189] The following offence specific factors were relevant in assessing which Band the present case fell into.

### ■   High Degree of Sexual Exploitation:

116    The acts of molest in this case were highly intrusive with all of J’s private parts being violated. They were not only skin on skin, they progressed to tongue on skin, to exposed penis on skin. The acts of molest were also prolonged on every occasion with the Accused becoming emboldened to take his time to have his way with her body once he saw that she was offering no resistance in her ‘sleep’. The 5th incident was also degrading when he simulated her active participation in pleasuring him.

### ■   The Offences were Pre-meditated & Planned:

117    With the cover of darkness being exploited, and the late hour timed so that everyone else was asleep in the flat and would not see what he was doing.

### ■   The Abuse of Trust:

118    The abuse here was insidious. By that, I mean that the Accused was a trusted member of the family and household, given leave to be in their midst, in the location where they were most entitled to let their guard down and be at home. Over time, he gained their trust so completely that he was allowed to be alone with J, to even attend to her daily needs.[^190] He knew the family’s routine, he knew their personalities, and he knew when J was at her most vulnerable. As a result, he knew what to do in order to be able to get away with it – which he would have had it not been for the fact that J finally faced up to the abuse years later. Whilst there was no evidence to indicate that the Accused had planned all along to do what he did when he first moved into the household, the betrayal was nonetheless utter and complete because the offences were plotted in a manner which took advantage of all that he had learnt and all that he had been given.

### ■   The Considerable Harm Caused:

119    For the sentencing, the Prosecution tendered a Victim Impact Statement from J, together with a Counselling Report prepared by the Social Worker who was attending to J for her trauma.[^191] The contents of these attachments were unchallenged before me. These documents showed that J did indeed seek counselling help on 12 May 2015 – this coincided squarely with her earlier trial testimony about how she was referred by the second IO to a counsellor after his interview with her on 9 May 2015. In total, J went on to attend 4 counselling sessions for support and to learn specific skills to cope with her issues. The counsellor noted that J was still experiencing flashbacks with recurrent distressing memories of the incidents, which were sometimes overwhelming and which resulted in her becoming stressed out, distracted, and unable to sleep at night. J was noted to be coping by packing her schedule full of activities so as to re-focus her attention and energy on those other goals and activities, tiring herself out as a way to get restful sleep at night. The counsellor noted that sports became a psychological outlet and coping mechanism for J, who was otherwise still struggling with low self-worth for being ‘unclean’ and self-blame for not reporting the incidents earlier. J also reported that she was unable to establish closer relationships with the opposite sex as she was reminded of the incidents. Turning to the Victim Impact Statement submitted (dated 11th April 2018), J reported the same matters, but did so in her own characteristic point-for-point manner: “_permanent scar in memory, unstable emotion, always in negative thinking, feeling depress, suicidal thought, isolation, fearful of men, being frustrated, low self-esteem, self-blaming, felt that body not pure anymore_”. Additionally, J said she “_feel horrible, reminded of incidents easily, nightmares, unable to focus in study, feeling afraid of physical touch with others, feel embarrassed and ashamed of the incident, difficult to forgive myself, wish the incident did not happened, constant flashback of the incident_”. It was plainly evident that the offences had resulted in significant harm to J, and that she was suffering psychologically and emotionally. This coincided with my assessment of her as I observed her testify and reviewed her testimony. These are the not uncommon consequences when those so young and unprepared are subjected to such acts. They can come about from just a single encounter – as was the case in _GBR_. Here, J was subjected to them repeatedly over 6 separate occasions. She could attest to those 6 because she woke. For clarity, I am not imputing that there were more. I am only stating the undeniable fact: that J could only attest to those which she was conscious to. Some might argue that the Accused should be given some form of credit for targeting her while she was supposedly asleep as it spared her the direct trauma. In my judgment, the correct way to account for that would be to consider the other as being more aggravated, than this being something to give credit for. The offender should reap the full consequences of his actions, and they were severe in this case.

### ■   Lack of Remorse:

120    This referenced the fact that the conviction was recorded after a full trial, where the victim broke down on multiple occasions whilst under cross-examination about the incidents, and about her imputed motives against her uncle. No concessions were given and none should therefore be expected.

### ■   The Sentencing Precedents:

121    On account of those factors listed, I determined that the present case fell within Band 2 of the _GBR_ framework, which stipulates that a term of imprisonment of between 1-3 years should be imposed together with caning where two or more aggravating factors are present. Cases involving skin-to-skin touching of the private parts and sexual organs ought to fall at the higher end of the spectrum of Band 2 cases.[^192] A review of the cases (which were cited with approval in _GBR_) illustrates where each offence should sit in Band 2:

> ■     _GBJ v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 6</span> – showed victim a porn film, rubbed left breast over clothes, kissed eyebrow, pulled her to lie down with her head on his stomach and attempted to unfasten his shorts, but the victim managed to leave before he could do anything further: 18 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

> ■     _PP v ABO_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 80</span> – touched vagina and buttocks over her shorts: 18 months’ imprisonment; rubbed penis at her vagina over her shorts: 21 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane; rubbed erect penis at vagina skin on skin: 2 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

> ■     _GBR v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 296</span> – fondled breasts for 5 minutes, touched and licked vagina for another 5 minutes, 45 year old uncle against 13 year old niece, convicted after trial, premeditated pretext to get victim alone, victim left psychologically scarred, lack of remorse and imputed false motives on victim: 25 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane. This case was closest on the facts.

122    The cases above showed that the sentence for the present offences ought to run upwards of 2 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes each. They were not anywhere near the 4 years’ imprisonment term submitted for by the Prosecution. There were no authorities cited by the Prosecution to justify that doubling. To illustrate how untenable the Prosecution’s position was, one need only examine the following two cases:

> ■     _PP v BMF_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 227</span> – 38 year old stepfather against 8-9 year old stepdaughter. Case involved multiple charges under s 354(2) of the Penal Code and one more serious charge under s 376(1)(a) of the Penal Code for putting his penis into her mouth while the victim continued to pretend to be asleep. Pleaded guilty. For the two proceeded charges under s 354(2), the acts involved kissing and inserting his tongue into her mouth, pulling her panties down, rubbing his exposed penis at her vagina and anus until he ejaculated, all while the victim continued to pretend to be asleep: 3 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. Next, kissing and inserting his tongue into her mouth, used her hands to stroke his exposed penis, touched her chest and buttocks, pulled panties down and licked her vagina and stroked with his finger, before finally rubbing his exposed penis against her vagina, all while the victim continued to pretend to be asleep: 3 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The _GBR_ framework was applied, and the case fell within Band 3.

> ■     _BLV v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 62</span> – 45 year old father against his own biological daughter who was between 11-13 at the time of the sexual abuse. Convicted after trial. Out of 10 charges, 5 were for OM under s 354(2) of the Penal Code: I. rubbing his penis against her face for a few minutes: 3 years’ 6 strokes, II. undressing her and licking her vagina: 2 years’ 6 strokes, III. slipped his hands under her undergarments to grab and squeeze her breasts, also later licking them: 2 years’ 6 strokes, IV. making her lie down so he could rub and penetrate her vagina with his finger: 3 years’ 6 strokes, and V. removing her underwear and rubbing his penis against her vagina and anus: 3.5 years’ and 6 strokes.

Despite these cases being much more aggravated on the facts, neither offered any support for the Prosecution’s sentencing position before me.

123    After considering all the submissions, and on account of the facts in this case, I imposed an aggregate sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment and 22 strokes of the cane. That was constituted as follows:

> ·    1st Charge: 2 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

> ·    2nd Charge: 2.5 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.

> ·    3rd Charge: 2.5 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.

> ·    4th Charge: 2.5 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.

> ·    5th Charge: 3 years’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.

> ·    6th Charge: 2 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane.

124    The sentence in the 1st and 5th charges were ordered to run consecutively to arrive at the aggregate. In doing so, I did consider whether the individual sentences ought to be adjusted.[^193] I found no strong reasons to do so. There were multiple instances of offending, and the aggregate appropriately reflected the totality and gravity of his actions against his niece. The table below summarizes the final sentencing positions.

[^1]: A non-publication order has been made under section 7(3) of the State Courts Act (Chapter 321) in relation to the identity of J in this case. Care should be taken in reporting the other parties involved and which may lead to J being identified.

[^2]: The nature of the relationship was stated as “my father’s mother’s brother’s son”, i.e. the Accused was a cousin to her father: NE, day 1, page 10.

[^3]: The most lucid form of this explanation was offered by the Accused when he summed up his case during his re-examination – NE, day 12, page 57-58.

[^4]: NE, day 1, page 11-13.

[^5]: NE, day 1, page 13.

[^6]: NE, day 1, page 14.

[^7]: NE, day 1, page 19.

[^8]: NE, day 1, Page 15. J also drew a sketch of her sleeping position (Exhibit P1); and that she was then lying on her right side in a foetal position facing the wall when it happened – pages 16-17.

[^9]: NE, day 1, page 17.

[^10]: NE, day 1, page 18. In J’s initial account, she said only her vagina had been touched – see page 15.

[^11]: Clarified at NE, day 2, page 22.

[^12]: NE, day 1, page 15. J also said her father was usually shirtless at night.

[^13]: NE, day 1, page 19.

[^14]: NE, day 1, page 19.

[^15]: NE, day 1, page 20.

[^16]: J said earlier that her usual sleeping position was lying on her right side and crouched in a foetal position. This would have made her anus and vagina accessible to one behind her. As for the subsequent actions of having her breasts licked, the implication appears to be that she was moved about.

[^17]: NE, day 1, page 19.

[^18]: NE, day 1, pages 20-21.

[^19]: NE, day 1, pages 21-22. J said she also could tell from the clothes that it was the Accused.

[^20]: NE, day 1, page 21.

[^21]: NE, day 1, page 21.

[^22]: NE, day 1, page 21.

[^23]: This aspect was clarified in cross-examination in the NE, day 2, page 17.

[^24]: NE, day 2, page 19 – J clarified in cross-examination that she was still lying on her right side and facing the inner wall; this indicated that her accessible left hand was held up and pulled slightly backwards to his penis.

[^25]: NE, day 1, page 24.

[^26]: NE, day 1, page 24-27.

[^27]: NE, day 1, page 27.

[^28]: The sequence – of this event taking place after the fifth incident – was clarified by J in cross-examination at NE, day 1, page 41.

[^29]: NE, day 1, page 22-23

[^30]: NE, day 2, page 4.

[^31]: NE, day 1 page 28-30.

[^32]: NE, day 1, page 31.

[^33]: J was then studying at Jurong Junior College.

[^37]: NE, day 4, page 77.

[^38]: NE, day 4, page 79.

[^39]: NE, day 4, page 80. It was evident that Mdm SLK was not very good with dates: during cross-examination, she said she could not remember when this event took place, but she could remember the sequence and the details: NE, day 5, page 32, 37, 40, 46.

[^40]: NE, day 4, page 72. Mdm SLK had the habit of using “he” as a gender neutral universal reference. A careful contextual reading of the NE is therefore required to correctly understand her testimony.

[^55]: The SMS was sent to the handphone used by J’s mother. It was undisputed that this same handphone was also used by J and J’s brother to talk to the Accused.

[^56]: NE, day 6, page 17.

[^57]: The Accused’s date of birth was 12 December 1973.

[^64]: NE, day 6, page 33.

[^65]: NE, day 6, page 35.

[^66]: NE, day 6, page 36. This case went through the CCDC process and the Defence had obtained the statement containing the partial admission entered by the Accused. It therefore appeared that the Accused was addressing this aspect about how his statement was recorded in pre-emption.

[^67]: NE, day 6, page 38.

[^68]: NE, day 6, page 41-47.

[^69]: The CV of Dr John Thomas was admitted and marked as Exhibit **D10**. By “idiopathic”, the doctor confirmed that he meant that the cause for the condition was not known: NE, day 12, page 25.

[^70]: The Medical Report dated 24 April 2017 was admitted and marked as Exhibit D11. During cross-examination, the doctor also confirmed that “palm” in his report included the fingers, did not include the dorsal (back) part of the hand: NE, day 12, page 30.

[^87]: See the signature of the Accused on page 1 of the Station Book extract admitted and marked as Exhibit **P9**.

[^88]: SSSgt Lim added during cross-examination that he had been informed about the arrest, and stayed back at the station to await the arrival of the Accused for the interview – NE, day 14, page 31.

[^89]: A5 and A6 of P6.

[^90]: NE, day 14, page 19-20.

[^94]: ND, day 14, page 66-67, 90-91.

[^95]: Whilst I recognised that there were potentially other scenarios as to what happened (e.g. that the incidents were welcomed and consented to), those were not the cases pursued. I nonetheless approached the evidence with an open mind and reviewed them for whatever that they plainly showed – whether they fell into the two scenarios or not.

[^96]: Paragraphs 38-45 of the Defence Closing Submissions.

[^97]: Indeed, if there was no ambient light, the Accused himself would not have been able to navigate himself to her bedroom for those occasions which he conceded to.

[^98]: Paragraphs 51-62 of the Defence Closing Submissions.

[^99]: NE, Day 2, page 14-16.

[^100]: Paragraphs 48 and 63 of the Defence Closing Submissions.

[^101]: To learned Counsel’s credit, the Defence made no submissions about the substance of J’s allegation being artificial, i.e. that her anus (and vagina) had been licked. This was correct because the object of erotic fetishes runs a wide gamut. We should be careful about reviewing the cogency of J’s account on this aspect against a narrow mainstream conception as to what pleasures.

[^102]: Paragraphs 79-81 of the Defence Closing Submissions.

[^103]: Paragraphs 46-50, 84-112 of the Defence Closing Submissions.

[^104]: The relevant portions of D6 were: A5 where J alluded to a “computer desk incident”, and A9 where J alluded to a “tossed and turned incident”, and the “pushed away incident”. Though J had alluded to them, she was not ultimately asked by the first IO to detail what happened on those 3 other incidents in that statement.

[^105]: NE, day 4, page 20,24-25.

[^106]: NE, Day 1, page 41-42.

[^107]: NE, day 4, page 18-19.

[^108]: Reiterated again at NE, day 3, page 68-69; and again on day 4, page 3.

[^109]: NE, day 4, page 23.

[^110]: NE, day 3, pages 13-15, and again on day 4 at pages 4-5, and reiterated in re-examination at page 57.

[^111]: NE, day 4, page 4-5, 27.

[^112]: NE, day 3, page 53-55.

[^113]: This was at A9 on page 4 of J’s first police statement which was admitted and marked as Exhibit D6.

[^114]: NE, day 3, page 66-67.

[^115]: NE, day 3, page 68.

[^116]: NE, day 4, page 2-3. I observed that J could have used the break in the proceedings to think through her position on the matter, and come back the next day with a more certain and damning position against the Accused if she was indeed as vengeful minded as the Defence contended, but J did no such thing. When she resumed her testimony under cross-examination, she was content to reiterate that she still did not remember this 3rd other incident. This indicated the plain-speaking to the point approach which she brought with her to the witness box.

[^117]: NE, day 4, page 8-9.

[^118]: NE, day 3, page 55-56. In relation to the point about whether J did enough for herself, the Defence also covered this aspect earlier, and J had also confirmed then that she did ask her mother – without disclosing the reason why – whether she could close her room door at night after the incidents started, but her mother reiterated that the open door practice should continue. This showed that J was doing what she could: NE, day 2, page 20-21.

[^129]: Paragraph 115 of the Defence’s Closing Submissions.

[^130]: NE, day 4, page 83-84; and during cross-examination on day 5, page 36-37, 44, 47; and reiterated during re-examination at page 63.

[^131]: During cross-examination, the Defence submitted that the Prosecution ought to call J’s counsellor to court as a witness, and that any failure to do so would raise doubts as to the veracity of J’s claims of having seen one for her trauma. I could not agree with this given that there was already evidence before the court from J and her mother about what J was experiencing. When J was questioned about the counsellor, she was able to provide a convincing, coherent and detailed chronology – NE, day 2, page 43-44 and 80-81, and day 4, page 61. It certainly did not appear at all to be a shallow claim. Additionally, during the final stage of these proceedings, this aspect about whether J experienced trauma and saw a counsellor was also conclusively addressed by the Prosecution – see paragraph 119 below. Coming at the stage that it did, those materials did not feature in the grounds for the conviction.

[^132]: The Accused confirmed he was 1.82m tall: NE, day 8, page 41.

[^133]: NE, day 1, page 26-27, where J said in her evidence-in-chief that she moved during her sleep.

[^134]: NE, day 2, page 40-42.

[^135]: Paragraphs 116-120, 131 of the Defence’s Closing Submissions.

[^136]: An individual photo of J smiling at this award ceremony was attached at page 3 of P10.

[^137]: Exhibits D3, D4 and D5 are all undated. They are variously stained with age spots, and the content clearly shows that they were penned by a very young J. The photos are attached at page 6 of P10; they show a visibly much younger J dressed in t-shirts and shorts being very comfortable with the Accused (who was similarly dressed), sitting on his lap with his arms around her, and in another case being carried by him on his back.

[^142]: NE, day 4, page 54-55.

[^143]: NE, day 4, page 34 and 63.

[^144]: And again in RX on day 4 NE at page 49-50.

[^145]: A photo of J standing on her own, looking very pleased with her award, was attached at page 3 of P10. There was no evidence as to how this picture was taken and how the Accused came into possession of it.

[^146]: The absence of records for that 6 month period may have something to do with the Accused having changed handphones – see s/no. 3 on page 6 of D2. For this period, the Accused was asked how many communications were there with J, and the Accused answered just “two”. Both were calls made by him to Mdm SLK who later then passed the phone to J so that he could have a ‘basic chit-chat with J to ask about her and to tell her that he missed her’: NE, day 9, page 38-39. The Accused also said that there were no communications/messages after Sept 2012 till when he was arrested: NE, day 9, page 40-41.

[^147]: There was no apparent response from the Accused to this message.

[^148]: Before me, it was not disputed that the “<3” symbol was a heart/love symbol.

[^149]: Even for item V, the “_Don’t wan!!!_” response from J was capable of two meanings: 1. That she did not want their lunch to be at an venue other than Vivocity Crystal Jade; or 2. That she did not want the Accused to bring Ms PMF along for the lunch. When quizzed on this during cross-examination, J said she could not remember what she meant by that response. A review of the rest of the 6 messages immediately following it shows that the topic continued to be about the lunch venue as the Accused teased J with cheaper alternatives to Vivocity Crystal Jade. In such circumstances, it could not be concluded that this response from J was clear evidence of her being possessive of her beloved uncle and not welcoming of Ms PMF.

[^150]: This observation was cited with approval in the case of _BLV v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGCA 62</span> at \[57\].

[^151]: NE, day 1, page 80.

[^152]: Parapgraphs 121-124 of the Defence’s Closing Submissions.

[^153]: Paragraphs 125-127 of the Defence’s Closing Submissions.

[^154]: The trial venue on that day was Court 4 in the old State Courts building.

[^155]: NE, day 3, page 21-22.

[^156]: Paragraph 128-130 of the Defence’s Closing Submissions.

[^157]: The Accused himself testified to this: that despite the night light, J’s room was still very dark – NE, day 8, page 21.

[^158]: Paragraph 139-146 of the Defence’s Closing Submissions.

[^159]: This point was pursued during the cross-examination of the first IO, that he was sympathetic to J, had accepted her complaint, and had thereafter determined to establish a case against the Accused.

[^160]: This was in relation to her account on how she pretended before others that nothing bad had happened.

[^161]: The only exception was in relation to the Prosecution’s action in omitting the tongued/licked detail from the 3rd Charge. Only the Prosecution could answer why that was so. Given the level of their prior preparations which they had accorded to this case, and which became apparent during the trial, I did not think one could put much store into the significance of this omission. In any event, it was a matter of prosecutorial discretion on which aspects to pursue.

[^162]: The Accused confirmed that he had another girlfriend before Ms PMF and that he was with her for 3-4 years. He also confirmed that J and the rest of the J household knew about this girlfriend: NE, day 9, page 9-13.

[^163]: NE, day 5, page 62.

[^164]: NE, day 4, page 65-66.

[^165]: NE, day 7, page 8-9, 11-12, and day 9, page 9.

[^166]: S/no. 5 on page 4 of D2 where this was sent to the Accused on 5 Jan 2012: “_Any cookie for sell call me._” and to which he replied several minutes later with “_Ok ok B-)_”.

[^167]: s/no. 41 on page 5 of D2 where this was sent to the Accused on 5 July 2012: “_Last time u go China got guy pearl powder . If have give me some._” And to which he replied sometime later “_Need to check_”.

[^168]: S/no. 34 on page 5 of D2 where this was sent to the Accused on 29 May 2012: “_Ok…. research ….want boy must eat meat n unsalted food n none spicy food. Girl must eat veg. N spicy n saltish food._” It should be noted that this message – and all the others being exchanged with the Accused – were also visible to J who was using the same handphone belonging to her mother to also communicate with the Accused.

[^169]: S/no. 13-14 on page 4 of D2.

[^170]: There was a fourth aspect which Mdm SLK testified to, but it was not a contested matter in the end, i.e. about how the Accused was touchy feely with J, and that Mdm SLK had spoken up about it when J got older.

[^171]: Mdm SLK gave an example of J’s cooling behaviour towards the Accused: that she became less keen to help her send messages to the Accused: NE, day 5, page 36-37, 44, 47, and reiterated in re-examination at page 63. All this was also consistent with D2 which showed that J stopped texting the Accused from her own handphone in 2011.

[^172]: NE, day 5, page 20-21, 47-49.

[^173]: NE, day 7, page 41-50.

[^174]: During cross-examination, the Accused conceded that Mdm SLK did ask him “_not to go too closely to J_”: ND, day 9, page 26-32.

[^175]: NE, day 7, page 18-27.

[^176]: NE, day 7, page 27-31.

[^177]: NE, day 8, page 30.

[^178]: The three instances in the NE are at day 7, page 32, 42; day 9, page 24; and day 11, page 44.

[^179]: NE, day 11, page 15, and day 12, page 52.

[^180]: See A5 and A6 in P6.

[^181]: See A9 and A10 in P6.

[^182]: The NE records at length the cross-examination of SSSgt Lim on the station documents: Exhibits P7-P9. Those were tendered by the Prosecution to show that the Accused was given rest and food during his time in custody. Unfortunately, these documents were not properly scrutinized by the Prosecution prior to their introduction. Some discrepancies were apparent, and a hapless SSSgt Lim ended up being subjected to a lengthy cross-examination on them. He was unprepared and somewhat shaken. I allowed the cross-examination on this aspect given the allegations made by the Accused about how he was apparently treated. In the end, when learned Counsel used this to loop back to the material aspects, SSSgt Lim stayed firm and reiterated that the Accused was treated fairly and that the content of P6 came from the Accused. The evidence about those station documents, including the apparent discrepancies, were ultimately irrelevant to the issues in this case though.

[^183]: The procedural discrepancies were two: (1) although the IO detailed in evidence what happened during the recording process, he conceded during cross-examination that he ought to have also recorded the initial denial of the Accused together with his subsequent admissions; (2) the IO said that the statement was read back to the Accused and that the Accused was also given time to read through the statement on his own, and that he did thereafter ask the Accused if he wanted to make any corrections, and that the Accused had declined – the IO conceded that the statement of this last aspect was inadvertently omitted in P6.

[^184]: NE, day 11, page 17-18, 28-29.

[^185]: The Plea in Mitigation dated 23 April 2018.

[^186]: Paragraphs 12-15 of the Defence Submissions on Sentence dated 30 April 2018.

[^187]: Paragraph 5 of the Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence dated 18 April 2018.

[^188]: Paragraph 15 of the Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence dated 18 April 2018.

[^189]: Deterrence is a particular concern where there is an abuse of trust in an inter-familial context, given the difficulty in the detection of the offences and the considerable barriers faced by the victim in reporting them: _PP v NF_ \[2006\]4 SLR(R) 849 at \[40\].

[^190]: J indicated that the Accused even used to dress her when she was younger – page 4 of D7.

[^191]: The Counselling Report and the Victim Impact Statement were attached to the Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence dated 18 April 2018.

[^192]: _GBR_ at \[34\].

[^193]: Following the approach in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ \[2014\]2 SLR 998 at \[25\].
