2       The Accused claimed trial to the following three charges:

3       He was convicted and sentenced to an imprisonment term of 7 years 8 months and 12 strokes of the cane. He was granted bail pending appeal.

## Case for Defence

4       Briefly, the defence was that the drugs found in the urine samples were due to the consumption of medications. The Accused claimed that he had been on medication for the past 1 year for suspected TB. He also challenged the urine samples taken which he claimed were not his. He also contended that there was leakage from the urine bottle. He alleged that there was CCTV footage at the CNB station but it was not produced in court. He also highlighted the erroneous date of 3 April 2017 stated in the Prosecution’s Summary of Facts supplied to him during the Criminal Case Disclosure Conference. The date 3 April 2017 was said to be the date analysts from HSA issued the certificates under section 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (“MDA”). It was erroneous as his arrest date was 28 March 2018. The original HSA certificates received by him were dated 2 and 3 April 2018 respectively.

5       As for the possession charge, the Accused claimed that there was no evidence of his DNA found. He alleged that the CNB officers could have planted the drugs found on him. Except for the alleged medication defence, the Accused did not claim he was authorised to possess or consume the drugs in question.

6       Besides the Accused, 3 other witnesses were also called by the Accused to give evidence on his behalf. One of them was the Accused’s wife whose evidence was of not much value. The others were at the CNB office on 28 March 2018 when the Accused was also there for the procurement of urine specimens.

## Prosecution’s Case

7       The Prosecution called 12 witnesses. There was also ancillary hearings held to determine the admissibility of the various statements recorded from the Accused.

8       The Prosecution also relied on the presumptions of section 18 (2) and section 22 of the MDA.

## My Findings

9       I found that on 28 March 2018 at unit XXX, Block 541, Bedok North Street 3, Singapore, the Accused was found to have with him a straw. I rejected the Accused’s bare allegation that the CNB officers planted the straw. Indeed, there was no evidence at all to support the allegation. I found no reason for the CNB officers to lie in court. I accepted the evidence of Mohd Affendi Bin Idris (PW1), a senior CNB officer, that another CNB officer Daniel Quek Wee Liang (PW2) recovered the straw when the latter did a physical search on the Accused. PW1 saw it was recovered from the Accused’s right trouser pocket. The straw was then handed over to PW1. This explained why reference was made to the straw during the recording of exhibit P3 where the Accused admitted that it was his.

10     The Accused was arrested and brought to CNB office where his urine sample was procured.

11     The evidence for procurement and testing of the urine samples was provided by the CNB officers who testified in court. It was also consistent with the Accused’s statement in exhibit P12.

12     Kannan s/o Radhamani (PW10), a CNB officer, escorted the Accused to procure his urine. The Accused washed and dried his hand, chose the necessary bottles and was escorted to the toilet to procure his urine specimens. Thereafter the Accused was brought to the Instant Urine Test (‘IUT’) operator PW9 with his urine samples.

13     Mohamed Fadli Bin Mohamed Sayee (PW9) was a senior CNB officer for about 10 years. At the material time, he was the IUT operator. He gave evidence as to his role as an IUT operator in this case. He generated exhibit P11 after the urine test and signed on it.

14     Wong Yiren (PW5) was the CNB sealing officer at the material time. PW5 used masking tape to seal the two bottles of urine sample of the Accused. She testified that she ensured the Accused confirmed the two bottles of his urine specimens were correctly identified with his particulars before putting his signatures on the HSA labels. Having ascertained that there was no leakage from the bottles; PW5 proceeded to seal the two bottles. The Accused was again asked to confirm his particulars on the HSA labels on the bottles before he put it into the locked metal container.

15     I have considered the defence of the Accused stated at \[4\] above in respect of the urine procurement and testing and the evidence given by his witnesses in his defence. I also took into account exhibit P12 at \[4\]. The defence witness Mohd Yahya Bin Mohd Ali (DW2) confirmed that on 28 March 2018, at the CNB office, he saw a CNB officer sealing the Accused’s urine sample. He did not notice any leakage from the urine bottle. He also saw 2 bottles in a plastic bag which were not DW2’s. He confirmed that two bottles of the Accused’s urine sample were deposited into the metal box. On the other hand, Alias Bin Samat (DW3) testified that there was leakage from the bottle containing the Accused’s urine sample. This was inconsistent with the evidence of DW2. In any event, the evidence of PW8 (Jordan Ong Han Hui) was that the urine sample delivered to HSA was sealed and intact. PW5 also confirmed that there was no leakage. HSA will also reject it if there were leakage. In these circumstances, I found that there was no leakage of the urine sample from the bottle.

16     I also rejected the Accused’s allegation that the urine sample provided was not his. He claimed that there was CCTV footage to support his allegation but it was not produced in court. In any event, Khoo Feng Yen (PW12), the investigation officer of the case, testified that the CCTV footage could not be retrieved, as it would be erased after 3 months. This was not challenged by the Accused.

17     Having considered all the evidence, I found that the urine samples of the Accused were procured in accordance with the requirement for the procurement of urine procedure set out in MDA and the Regulations 6, Cap185. I also have no doubt that the urine specimens were that of the Accused’s.

18     The Accused’s urine samples and the straw were sent to HSA for analysis. His urine samples were analysed and found to contain monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine. The presence of monoacetylmorphine in the urine samples was stated in the HSA certificates issued under s16 of MDA by Ng Xue Qin (PW7) and Ong Han Hui Jordan (PW8), analysts at HSA, Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. See exhibits P7 dated 3 April 2018 and P9 dated 3 April 2018.

19     The presence of monoacetylmorphine in the urine was a result of consumption of diamorphine. Monoacetylmorphine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA. I have no reason to doubt the evidence of PW7 and PW8 regarding their respective analysis of the urine samples of the Accused and the verification of the identity on the urine bottles against the submission form. I also accepted the evidence of PW7 that for monoacetylmorphine, after the consumption of diamorphine and subject to the metabolism rate of the subject, monoacetylmorphine can be found in the urine.

20     PW7 and PW8 also issued exhibits P8 dated 2 April 2018 and P10 dated 2 April 2018 respectively pursuant to section 16 of the MDA. P8 and P10 indicated the presence of methamphetamine in the urine samples provided by the Accused. Methamphetamine is a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

21     The substance in the straw was analysed and found to contain diamorphine. See exhibit P5 dated 19 April 2018. Diamorphine is a Class A Controlled Drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

## The Section 22 MDA Presumption

22     Section 22 of the MDA states that “if any controlled drug is found in the urine of a person as a result of both urine tests conducted under section 31(4)(b), he shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have consumed that controlled drug in contravention of section 8(b).”

23     The Court of Appeal in _Mohammad Ashik bin Aris v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 4 SLR 802</span> at \[10\] held that upon the compliance with section 31(4)(b) MDA and “if there are positive results from both of the urine tests carried out pursuant to this subsection, the s 22 presumption will operate to presume that the accused person has, in contravention of section 8(b), consumed the controlled drug detected in his urine samples. This means that both the actus reus and the mens rea of the section 8(b) offence are presumed by section 22”.

24     Hence, the burden shifted to the Accused to rebut this presumption by proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he had not knowingly consumed controlled drugs detected in his urine specimens.

25     In this case, I found that there was compliance with the urine procurement procedures. The relevant certificates stating the result of the urine test had also been signed and issued by the HSA analysts. See \[18\] and \[20\] above.

26     Next was whether the Accused’s urine was tested positive due to his alleged consumption of medication. In this respect, I found that the Accused was unable to specify what medication he had consumed. In exhibit P12, the Accused stated that he did not take any traditional medications. The Accused also did not state in his caution statements that he had taken any specific medications. In the circumstances, I rejected his allegation. Considering all the evidence, I found that the Accused has not disproved both the actus reus and mens rea of the consumption charges on a balance of probabilities. Accordingly, I found the Accused had consumed both monoacetylmorphine and methamphetamine.

27     Alternatively, based on the Accused’s statements, it was clear that he did consume the illegal drugs. I will now proceed to deal with the Accused’s statements.

## Ancillary hearings for admissibility of a contemporaneous statement dated 28.3. 2018 (P3) (P4 is the English translation of P3).

28     After the ancillary hearing, the statement recorded by the senior CNB officer Mohd Affendi Bin Idris (PW1), from the Accused at the unit # XXX, Block 541, Bedok North Street 3, Singapore (“unit”) was admitted into evidence as exhibit P3. P3 was recorded in Malay. The English translation of P3 is exhibited as P4. In P3, the Accused admitted to the possession of the straw of heroin and the consumption of heroin and Ice, a street name for methamphetamine.

29     P3 was recorded on 28 March 2018 at 2305 hours in a bedroom at the unit in the Malay Language.

30     I rejected the Accused’s allegation that he signed P3 because of the threat to bring his wife to CNB station and leaving no one around to take care of the children. I found it was a bare allegation. There was no evidence that PW1 or any identified CNB officer did threaten to bring the Accused’s wife to the CNB station.

31     The Accused also highlighted that it was recorded without the presence of his wife and within closed door. With respect, I did not see how this would constitute a threat, promise, or inducement.

32     The Accused also mentioned that there were other CNB officers present in the room. The fact that there were other CNB officers present in the room was a neutral factor as there was no evidence to suggest that they had made any kind of threat or promise. PW1 had explained that the CNB officers were walking in and out of the room and they were there only for a few minutes.

33     Khoo Feng Yen (AH-PW2), a CNB officer for 19 years also gave evidence for this ancillary hearing. Khoo Feng Yen was the investigation officer of this case. The officer testified that the Accused did not mention to her about any threat made by PW1 or any of the other CNB officers during the recording of P3.

34     There was also no evidence to suggest any motive for the CNB officers to lie in court regarding P3.

35     In the circumstances, I accepted the evidence of PW1 that there was no threat inducement or promise made to the Accused when P3 was recorded. I also noted that PW1 has clarified that the Malay word he has written in Q7 of P3 should read as “Tehankan” in Malay and not “seksakan” as written in P4. In any event, Q7A7 was not a relevant issue.

36     In P4, the Accused admitted that the straw containing heroin was his. He also admitted that he smoked Ice with heroin. There was also the evidence of Quek Wee Liang (PW2) that he was the officer who searched and recovered exhibit P2 from the Accused. See also exhibit P12 at \[3\] and \[6\]. There was therefore overwhelming evidence that the Accused was in possession of P2 (the straw) which was analysed and found to contain diamorphine. Hence, it would also trigger the presumption in section 18 MDA.

## Statement dated 29 March 2018 (Exhibit P12)

37     In respect of exhibit P12, the Accused alleged that it was not recorded accurately. P12 was recorded on 29 March 2018 by CNB officer Kannan (PW10). I have no reason to doubt the voluntariness of this statement and its accuracy. In P12, the Accused confessed to a straw of heroin found on him and the consumption of Ice and the abuse of heroin.

## The Three Caution Statements (P13, P14 and P15) recorded By PW12

38     The Accused objected to the admissibility of the statement exhibit P13, recorded by Khoo Feng Yen, a senior CNB officer (PW12) on 4 April 2018 at 4.17pm. After the ancillary hearing, I admitted this statement into evidence. I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was made voluntarily. There was no evidence or reason for me to doubt the evidence of PW12. I rejected the bare allegation by the Accused that he was promised bail if he co-operated. I found there was no reason for PW12 to make such promise. Neither was there any reason for PW12 to fabricate the statement of the Accused.

39     The Accused did not object to the admissibility of P14 and P15 recorded on 4 April 2018 at 4.31pm and 4.49pm respectively by PW12. In both instances, the Accused gave the same statement as in P13.

40     In exhibits P13, P14 and P15, there was no complaint by the Accused regarding the urine procurement procedure or any allegation of threat given by anyone in respect of the recording of exhibit P3. There was also no allegation that he was on any medication. In these three statements, the Accused admitted that he consumed Ice and acknowledged there was no threat, inducement or promise made.

41     I noted there were typographical errors when PW12 stated “05 March 2018” on the first page of the charge below her name in respect of P13 and P14. Clearly, these were mere clerical errors that were not material. Other than this clerical error, the statements were accurately recorded from the Accused.

## Guilty and Convicted

42     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution has proven all the three charges against the Accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, he was found guilty and convicted.

## Antecedents

43     The memorandum of certified previous convictions (exhibit P16) shows that the Accused was first convicted of drug consumption on 16 June 2000 when he was jailed for a total of 2 years. In 2003, he was again jailed for drug consumption for a jail term of 3 years. In 2007, he was sentenced to a jail term of 5 years 6 months and 3 strokes of the cane. He again re-offended in 2012 and was imprisoned for 7 years and 6 strokes of the cane for a LT2 charge.

## Submission on Sentence

44     The Prosecution submitted for a global imprisonment term of at least 8 years 2 months and the minimum mandated caning. The learned DPP submitted for a sentence of 7 years 6 months and 6 strokes of the cane in respect of DAC 913097/2018 and DAC 913098/2018 respectively. As for DAC 913099/2018, the Prosecution submitted for an imprisonment term of 8 to 12 months.

## Mitigation

45     The Accused did not make any mitigation. He merely asked for deferment of sentence.

## Sentencing Considerations

46     Given the nature of the offences committed by the Accused was drug related, I was of the view that the main sentencing consideration must be deterrence.

47     In assessing the sentence, I also considered the punishment prescribed for the offences committed by the Accused. The penalty prescribed for repeat drug consumption offence is a mandatory minimum imprisonment of 7 years up to a maximum imprisonment of 13 years and a minimum of 6 strokes of the cane up to a maximum of 12 strokes of the cane. On the other hand, for drug possession, the punishment can be up to 10 years’ imprisonment or fine or both.

48     I noted that the Accused has not shown any remorse.

49     I agreed with the Prosecution that an uplift from the minimum mandated imprisonment was necessary. However, I made the necessary adjustment in favour of the Accused by taking into account the period the Accused was in remand before he was released on bail. I therefore sentenced the Accused to the minimum mandated sentence in respect of the LT2 drug consumption charge. In view of the downward adjustment, it would not be appropriate to backdate the sentence to the date he was first remanded. To do so would not reflect appropriately the Accused’s criminality, his habitual reoffending and lack of remorse.

50     I noted that the Prosecution’s sentencing submission for the drug possession charge was within the normal sentencing range.

51     I also noted that all the three offences were committed in the same transaction.

## Conclusion

52     In the circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to an imprisonment term of 7 years’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane in respect of DAC 913097/2018 and DAC 913098/2018 respectively. As for the drug possession charge (DAC913099/2018), he was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. The sentences in DAC913098/2018 and DAC913099/2018 were ordered to run consecutively. The total sentence was an imprisonment term of 7 years 8 months and 12 strokes of the cane.
