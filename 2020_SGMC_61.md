### District Judge Kan Shuk Weng:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, a 38-year-old male Singaporean, claimed trial to three charges under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed):

> (i)     a charge under section 354 for using criminal force on the Victim by kissing her lips, knowing it to be likely that he would outrage her modesty, committed at the basement carpark of 6 raffles Boulevard (“the 1st Charge”);

> (ii)     a charge under section 354 for using criminal force on the Victim by stroking her right thigh, lifting up her skirt, and grabbing and squeezing her right inner thigh, knowing it to be likely that he would outrange her modesty, committed along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (“the 2nd Charge”); and

> (iii)     a charge under section 352 for using criminal force on the Victim by grabbing her hand and putting her fingers into his mouth and sucking her fingers, committed along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (“the 3rd Charge”).

2       The Accused was represented.

3       On 22 October 2020, I amended the charges and convicted the Accused on the amended charges. After hearing submissions on sentence from the Prosecution, as well as the mitigation and address on sentence presented by the Defence, I sentenced the Accused to a term of imprisonment of 18 weeks and a fine of $1,000 (in default, 5 days’ imprisonment) on 13 November 2020.

4       The Accused has filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the sentence is stayed pending appeal. I now set out the reasons for my decision.

## The Prosecution’s Case

5       To prove its case, the Prosecution adduced evidence from three main witnesses:

> (i)     the Victim (PW2);

> (ii)     the Victim’s sister (“DN”) (PW3); and

> (iii)     the Victim’s friend (“VT”) (PW4).

6       In addition, the Prosecution called various other witnesses, including rebuttal witnesses:

> (i)     SSSgt Goh Wen Qiang (PW1), who was the Investigation Officer;

> (ii)     Ken Ng (PW5), who recorded the Accused’s long statement (D2) (the “Long Statement”);

> (iii)     ASP Jerry Tan (PW6), who recorded the Accused’s cautioned statements (P8 to P10) (the “Cautioned Statements”;

> (iv)     Mohamed Asri bin Hamid (PW7), who retrieved the gantry records for the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6; and

> (v)     Steve Tan Tian Shen (PW8), who retrieved the gantry records for the carpark at 6 Raffles Boulevard.

7       The Prosecution also sought to admit the Cautioned Statements made by the Accused to show that the Accused’s evidence was externally inconsistent with his claim that the Victim took methamphetamine.

8       There were no eye witnesses to the offences.

### The evidence of the Victim and the Victim’s sister

9       The Victim testified that prior to the offences, she met VT as they had planned to go clubbing at “Get Juiced”. Along the way, VT told the Victim that her friend “Imran”, the Accused, would be meeting them at the club[^1].

10     The Accused, the Victim and VT were at Get Juiced until about 2.00am before proceeding to another club, “Fleek”. However, as they found it boring, they soon left and proceeded to yet another club, “Baliza”, where they stayed until Baliza’s closure at 6.00am.

11     The trio then left Baliza and walked towards the Accused’s car which was parked in the carpark at 6 Raffles Boulevard. VT was walking in front, while the Accused and the Victim were “right behind” her. As they were walking behind VT, the Accused grabbed the Victim’s face and “gave \[her\] a peck on her lips”[^2]. The Victim was shocked and pushed the Accused away[^3]. She then immediately walked to the front, towards VT who was vomiting. The Victim did not tell VT what the Accused had done as she did not want to upset VT as she thought that VT and the Accused were seeing each other at that time[^4]. The Victim also thought that perhaps the Accused was drunk and had acted uncharacteristically[^5].

12     The Victim and VT then boarded the Accused’s car. VT took the front passenger seat while the Victim sat behind. The Accused proceeded to drive them to VT’s block at Ang Mo Kio to drop VT off. At the car park of Blk 124 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, VT got out of the car and told the Victim to take the front seat. The Victim did so accordingly. It was her evidence that as they were “exiting \[her friend’s\] car park”, the Accused touched her right thigh, and then lifted her skirt before grabbing her right inner thigh, near her vagina. At that point, the Victim felt terrified and shocked. She felt “unprotected” and immediately pushed the Accused’s hand away.

13     As the Victim pushed the Accused’s hand away, the Accused grabbed her hand, put her fingers into his mouth and sucked her fingers. The Victim was shocked and terrified and attempted to text VT. The text messages (P3) between the Victim and VT were admitted into evidence. The Victim further testified that although she was tipsy at that time, she was aware of her surroundings[^6].

14     The Accused eventually drove out of the car park and proceeded towards the “highway”. When the Accused pulled alongside the road to relieve himself, the Victim immediately got out of the Accused’s car. In her haste, she left her heels behind in the Accused’s car and started walking towards VT’s block. The Accused caught up with her and offered to send her. The Victim declined.

15     When the Victim arrived at VT’s block, she texted her friend. However, there was no response from her friend and eventually the Victim called for an Uber car and went home.

16     It was the evidence of DN, that on the morning in question, she was getting ready for work when she saw the Victim crying in the living room. As DN was in a rush, she told the Victim to WhatsApp her. The Victim then texted DN and related her ordeal to DN – the exchange of WhatsApp messages between the Victim and DN were marked collectively as P4. It was the evidence of DN that the incident affected the Victim adversely, and after encouragement from her, the Victim eventually made a police report on 20 March 2018 (P1).

### The evidence of the Victim’s friend

17     VT confirmed that she and the Victim were friends. On the day in question, she had invited the Victim to go clubbing with her and the Accused. She had met with the Victim, and both of them then went to Get Juiced where they met the Accused. The Accused was someone she had gotten to know on Tinder[^7], and he had initially used a fictitious name. She only found out about his real name when they went on a trip to Johor Bahru[^8].

18     VT recalled that, on that day, the three of them eventually ended up at Baliza after leaving Get Juiced. After clubbing at Baliza, as they were walking to the car park, she went to the side and threw up. She was unable to recall where exactly the Victim and the Accused were at that time, but she knew that they were behind her[^9].

19     VT further testified that when she first received the distressed messages from the Victim, she tried to call the Victim[^10]. However, VT did not manage to talk to the Victim as the Victim either did not pick up her call or the call did not get through[^11]. They continued communicating _via_ WhatsApp instead, as reflected in P3. At some point, VT called the Accused and told him to send the Victim home and this was reflected in her text message to the Victim[^12].

20     Later on the same day, VT spoke to the Accused who told her that he did not remember anything[^13]. VT communicated the Accused’s claim to the Victim and told the Victim that she (VT) believed the Victim.

21     Subsequently, VT managed to retrieve the Victim’s heels from the Accused and returned them to the Victim.

### The evidence of the Investigation Officer

22     The evidence of the Investigation Officer, SSSgt Goh Wen Qiang (“SSSgt Goh”), was fairly formal in nature. He testified that, after taking “over the investigation”, he obtained certified true copies of the First Information Report (P1) and the Arrest Report (P2)[^14]. SSSgt Goh made arrangements for the exchange of WhatsApp messages between the Victim and VT (P3), and between the Victim and DN (P4) to be translated by his colleagues at the CID[^15].

## The Defence’s Case

23     At the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence made a submission of no case to answer. After hearing parties, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a _prima facie_ case against the Accused and called upon the Accused to give evidence in his defence.

24     The Accused elected to give evidence.

### The evidence of the Accused

25     The Accused gave evidence that he came to know the Victim, through VT at Get Juiced, just prior to the offences[^16]. As for VT, he came to know her about two months prior to their date at Get Juiced through Tinder[^17], an online dating application. He observed the Victim to be “skinny and pale” and did not talk to her[^18].

26     After Get Juiced, the trio proceeded to Fleek. According to the Accused, as they were walking to Fleek, the Victim suddenly shouted at two girls, who were unknown to them, and accused them of staring at her[^19]. The Accused was perplexed as the girls were not looking at the Victim and asked VT if the Victim was alright. He claimed that VT told him that the Victim was “just paranoid”[^20].

27     The Accused claimed that he became disgusted with the Victim’s behaviour at Fleek as she was dancing intimately with a man and acted as if she was trying to seduce the man[^21]. He then told VT that he wanted to leave Fleek and that the Victim could stay on with the man[^22]. However, both the Victim and VT decided to leave Fleek with the Accused, while complaining that he had wasted their cover charge[^23].

28     The Accused then drove from Fleek to 6 Raffles Boulevard, where Baliza was located[^24]. The Accused said that he did not talk to the Victim at Baliza as he found her to be poorly behaved – she was loud, had made rude comments about him his car being a Grab car[^25] and spilled her drink on his friend[^26]. Subsequently, the Victim fell and had to be helped by the Accused and his friend. The Accused alleged that VT told him that the Victim was behaving erratically as the Victim was having problems with her boyfriend, who was VT’s cousin. The Accused further claimed that VT told her that her cousin would “always, go and beat her up (sic)”[^27].

29     The Accused testified that after speaking to VT, he found the Victim crying and shivering with her mobile phone in her hand. He approached her to console her, and at the same time, both of them followed behind VT who had gone to the side of the carpark to throw up[^28]. After VT threw up, the Accused said that they went back into Baliza as he had to “keep” his bottle of whisky[^29]. They continued dancing but after a while, the Accused decided to go home and offered to send VT home[^30].

30     The Accused said that he left Baliza at about 5.45am. He walked in front, while the Victim and VT followed behind[^31]. When they got to his car, he told VT to use the GPS on her mobile phone so that he could navigate to Blk 124 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 as his mobile phone was “flat”. VT sat in the front passenger seat while the Victim was behind. There was no conversation in the car as he was tired and was focusing on his driving. VT was also quiet even though she appeared “high”. As for the Victim, the Accused said he did not “notice”[^32].

31     It took him about 17 minutes to drive from Raffles Boulevard to Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. When they arrived at Blk 124 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, VT left the car after telling the Accused that the Victim stayed at Woodlands. The Accused claimed that he had no choice but to send the Victim home as the Victim had already emerged from the back seat and gone to the front passenger seat[^33].

32     The Accused gave evidence that he immediately exited the carpark[^34], but had the “urge to go and pee”[^35] as he was driving along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. At that moment, the Accused noticed that the Victim appeared to have fallen asleep in his car. He woke her up and told her that he had to stop the car to relieve himself[^36]. The Accuse then proceeded to stop his car along the side of the road. As he was relieving himself, he noticed that the Victim had also gotten out of the car and had started walking in the direction of VT’s block. The Accused offered to send the Victim, but she declined. The Accused then drove off[^37].

33     About a week after 4 March 2018, the Accused claimed that he came to know that the Victim had been spreading rumours that he had molested her, and VT had told him that the Victim accused him of kissing her and squeezing her thigh[^38]. After the incident, the Accused saw the Victim at Baliza with VT. This was before she lodged the police report on 20 March 2018[^39].

34     In relation to the exchange of WhatsApp messages between the Victim and VT (P3), the Accused denied the allegations made by the Victim against him. He claimed that he wanted to apologise to the Victim for leaving her along the road, and she had to walk barefooted to VT’s block. He also said that contrary to what he told VT, he was not actually drunk – he meant instead that he was tired and had consumed alcohol[^40].

35     The Accused alleged that the Victim had made false allegations against him as she was upset that he had rejected her advances. He reasoned that the Victim had more than 30 minutes to fabricate the accusations against him[^41]. He further claimed that VT had told his cousin, Ismail, that the Victim was “doing meth (sic)” which was why the Victim “was behaving strangely on that night”[^42]. In addition, VT allegedly agreed that it was the Victim’s ex-boyfriend (VT’s cousin) who told the Victim to make a police report against the Accused[^43]. The Accused further claimed that it was not possible to lift the Victim’s skirt and grab her thigh, and that he had tried to “demonstrate” the Victim’s accusation with his wife but it was not possible for him to grab the Victim’s wrist and put her fingers into his mouth while he was driving[^44].

36     In addition to his evidence in court, the Defence adduced the Accused’s statement (D2) (_i.e._, the Long Statement) that was recorded by Ken Ng (“Mr Ng”) pursuant to section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (the “CPC”).

### The evidence of the Accused’s cousin

37     The Defence called the Accused’s cousin, Ismail bin Ali (DW2) (“Mr Ismail”) to give evidence. He shared a close relationship with the Accused[^45].

38     He testified that he came to know VT at Baliza when the Accused introduced her to him. He then came to know the Victim through VT. However, he was unable to recall if he came to know them before or after the molest incident[^46].

39     In relation to the molest incident, Mr Ismail testified that the Accused told him that he “did nothing”, and had woken up the Victim by calling her name. As for the Victim, she did not mention the incident to him. However, Mr Ismail claimed that VT spoke to him about the matter. She purportedly told Mr Ismail that the Victim “can’t be believed (sic)” and that she was “under the influence of drugs”[^47]. She also told him that it was her cousin who forced the Victim to make the police report against the Accused[^48].

40     Mr Ismail also alleged that, about a week after he had been introduced to the Victim, he was at Get Juiced with “Shafiq” and saw the Victim there as well. At that time, he was dating VT, and claimed that the Victim was dating Shafiq. According to him, the Victim was behaving normally at that time and did not “seem paranoid”[^49].

## The Rebuttal Evidence

41     At the close of the Defence’s case, the Prosecution applied under section 230(1)(_t_) of the CPC to call the recording officers, Mr Ng and ASP Jerry Tan (“ASP Tan”), who recorded the Accused’s statements pursuant to section 22 and 23 of the CPC. In addition, the Prosecution applied to called Mohamed Asri bin Hamid (“Mr Asri”) and Steve Tan (“Mr Tan”) to testify in relation to when the Accused’s car exited the carparks at 6 Raffles Boulevard and Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. The Defence had no objections to the application[^50].

### The evidence of the recording officers

42     Mr Ng testified that he recorded the Long Statement on 27 March 2018. When asked by the Defence, Mr Ng denied drawing a map for the Accused and telling him that “the molest \[had taken\] place near Presbyterian High School along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6”. It was his testimony that had he done so, he would have enclosed it to the Long Statement after he and the Accused had signed on it[^51]. Mr Ng left the police force two months after recording the Long Statement[^52]. In re-examination, Mr Ng clarified that he was not the officer who recorded the Victim’s statement and he did not think that he had met the Victim[^53].

43     With respect to ASP Tan, it was his evidence that he recorded three statements pursuant to section 23 of the CPC from the Accused on 16 October 2018[^54] (P8 to P10) (_i.e._, the Cautioned Statements). When cross-examined, it was put to him that he had disallowed the Accused to provide more details in relation to the third Cautioned Statement (P10) and that he had told the Accused that it could not be done as the Accused had already signed the statement. This was emphatically denied by ASP Tan who testified that as an Investigation Officer, if an accused person or witness had wished to give a statement, he would have recorded it[^55].

### The evidence relating to when the Accused’s car exited the carparks

44     When the Accused was on the stand, it became clear that the Accused was disputing that he, the Victim and VT left Baliza after it closed – he claimed that they left Baliza at about 5.45am or 5.50am[^56], before its closing time. He would therefore have exited Baliza’s carpark at about 5.52am[^57]. After that, he drove to VT’s block at Ang Mo Kio 6 and estimated that it would have taken him about 17 minutes[^58] to drive there. He exited the carpark immediately after dropping VT off, with the Victim who had moved to the front passenger seat. He estimated that he arrived at VT’s carpark at about 6.10am and exited it about a minute later[^59].

45     It was not disputed that the Accused was driving a vehicle bearing registration number SKX 7647 G with IU number 1126245132 at the material time[^60].

46     Mr Asri was the Enforcement Officer for Secure Parking Singapore Private Limited. It was his evidence that the Accused’s car entered the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 at about 6.35am and exited the same at about 6.42am[^61] on 4 March 2018. Mr Asri also testified that both audit reports on the carpark gantries showed that there were no technical issues with the gantries[^62]. In relation to the time, the time at the entry and exit stations at the gantries was synchronised to the Internet and would “auto reset” at midnight everyday[^63].

47     In relation to the gantry records at the carpark at 6 Raffles Boulevard, the Prosecution called Mr Tan, who was the security manager of Marina Square[^64]. Mr Tan testified that the records showed that the Accused’s car entered the carpark twice on 4 March 2018, once at 12.07am for a duration of about one minute, and the second occasion at about 2.43am. The Accused’s car exited the carpark at about 6.12am on that occasion[^65]. Mr Tan further testified that the time at the gantry was synchronised to the Internet, and that the carpark gantries were subjected to quarterly maintenance checks[^66]. As far as Mr Tan was aware, there were no defects with the gantries where the Accused had entered and exited the carpark on 4 March 2018[^67].

## Prosecution’s Application to Recall the Victim

48     Pursuant to the evidence given by Mr Asri and Mr Tan, the Prosecution made an application under section 283(1) of the CPC to recall the Victim to clarify her evidence in relation to the carpark record (P14) produced by Mr Asri which reflected the time at which the Accused’s car exited the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6. The Defence left the decision to me, but reserved its rights to cross-examine the Victim on this point[^68].

49     Having considered the application by the Prosecution and that the fact that the Victim was a material witness, I allowed the application as I was of the view that her evidence was essential to making a just decision in the present case.

50     On further examination, the Victim clarified that what she meant was that when the Accused molested her in his car, it was not at VT’s block[^69]. At that time, she was very scared and was unable to focus on the exact location[^70]. However, referring to the map showing the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (P17), she said that it was “around the HDB blocks along Ang Mo Kio St 12”[^71]. The Victim then proceeded to mark on P17, with a red circle, the possible location where she was molested by the Accused in the car[^72]. She further confirmed that it was only after VT called the Accused that the Accused proceeded along Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 towards the highway[^73].

## Closing Submissions

### The Prosecution’s submissions

51     The Prosecution submitted, _inter alia_, that the Victim was an “unusually convincing witness” and had no reason to lie[^74]. Her evidence was internally consistent – she gave her account of the events “in a clear and coherent manner that was compelling”, and her evidence remained “unshaken under cross-examination”[^75]. The Prosecution also submitted that the Victim’s testimony was externally consistent as her account of the assault was corroborated by the exchange of WhatsApp messages between the Victim and VT (P3), and between the Victim and DN (P4)[^76].

52     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the Accused was not a credible witness – his defence was internally inconsistent and contained “glaring inconsistencies”[^77]. In addition, the Accused’s defence was externally inconsistent and the Accused told a number of “_Lucas_ lies” in the course of the trial[^78].

### The Defence’s submissions

53     The Defence submitted, _inter alia_, that the Victim was not a credible witness and highlighted six aspects of the Victim’s evidence that was not credible[^79]. In addition, the Defence submitted that the Victim was not consistent in her description of the location where the Accused had touched and grabbed her thigh and put her fingers into his mouth[^80]. The Defence further submitted that VT and DN did not witness the offences being committed and, in any event, were not independent witnesses – there was therefore a lack of corroborative evidence in the Prosecution’s case[^81].

54     The Defence argued that there was “no direct evidence to directly pin-point (sic)” that the Accused had committed the offences. The Accused had not admitted, at anytime, to committing the offences and “did not possess any intention” to molest the Victim[^82].

## My Decision

### Amendment of charges

55     After hearing the submissions by the Prosecution and the Defence, I amended the charges pursuant to section 128(1) of the CPC. The amendments were made to take into account the evidence of Mr Tan and Mr Asri, in relation to when the Accused’s car left the carpark at 6 Raffles Boulevard and when the Accused’s car entered and exited the car park at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6.

56     In addition, I amended the location in relation to the 2nd Charge and 3rd Charge to “in the vicinity of Blk 124 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6” to better reflect the description given by the Victim. Finally, I removed the words “and squeezing” from the 2nd Charge as it was not apparent from the Victim’s testimony that the Accused had squeezed her thigh.

57     After reading the amended charges, the Prosecution and Defence indicated that they did not wish to recall any of the witnesses.

### The ingredients of the charges

58     The ingredients for the amended 1st Charge and 2nd Charge are:

> (a)     the Accused used criminal force against the Victim without her consent; and;

> (b)     the Accused knew that he would likely outrage the modesty of the Victim by his action.

59     The ingredients of the amended 3rd Charge are:

> (a)     the Accused intentionally used force against the Victim without her consent; and;

> (b)     the Accused knew that he would likely cause injury, fear or annoyance to the Victim by his action.

### The applicable law

60     The Prosecution’s case was based primarily on the evidence of the Victim, specifically whether she was a credible witness. I was mindful of the case law that a victim’s evidence in a sexual assault case, where there is no independent corroboration must be “unusually convincing”[^83]:

> 37    The rule as to corroboration in so far as sexual offences are concerned was laid down in the local context in the Singapore High Court decision of _Khoo Kwoon Hain v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 591</span> (“_Khoo Kwoon Hain_”), where Yong Pung How CJ held that while there was no rule of law in this country that in sexual offences, the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated, it was nonetheless unsafe to convict in cases of this kindunless the evidence of the complainant was “unusually convincing” (_Khoo Kwoon Hain_ at \[50\]… .

> 38    As to what “unusually convincing” means, Yong CJ, in _Teo Keng Pong v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span>, clarified (at \[73\]) that this simply meant that the witness’s testimony must be “so convincing that the Prosecution’s case was proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence” (see also _Lee Kwang Peng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 569</span> (“_Lee Kwang Peng_”) at \[69\]–\[70\] and _Kwan Peng Hong_ (\[37\] _supra_) at \[33\])… .

> 39    Given that the standard of proof required in a criminal case is already that of “beyond a reasonable doubt” (see \[34\]–\[35\] above), the expression “unusually compelling” must mean something more than a mere restatement of the requisite standard of proof. ... In our view, therefore, the “extra something” implied by the word “unusually” must refer to the need for the trial judge to be aware of the dangers of convicting solely on the complainant’s testimony as well as of the importance of convicting only on testimony that, when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused. Since a mandatory warning from the judge to himself is not required, the implication is that the appellate courts will scrutinise the trial judge’s grounds of decision to see whether the trial judge was indeed aware of the danger of convicting on the bare word of the complainant as well as whether the quality of the testimony itself was consistent with the high standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Credibility of Prosecution witnesses

61     In determining whether the Victim was unusually convincing, I took into account her demeanour, the internal consistency in the contents of her evidence, and the external consistency between the contents of her evidence and extrinsic evidence. While VT and DN did not witness the Accused’s assaults against the Victim, their evidence corroborated the Victim’s account and lent credence to the Victim’s version of the events. I found the Victim, VT and DN to be credible witnesses, whose testimonies were largely consistent with each other’s, and supported by the WhatsApp exchanges (P3 and P4).

#### The amended 1st charge

62     In relation to the amended 1st Charge, I accepted the Victim’s and VT’s version that VT had thrown up at the side while the three of them were walking to the Accused’s car, and that they had not returned to Baliza after VT threw up. Instead, they got into the Accused’s car to go home. Both the Victim and VT were unequivocal in their evidence in relation to when they left Baliza, and when VT had thrown up. In addition, VT was able to explain why she was so certain that they had not gone back to Baliza after she threw up – if they had intended to continue clubbing, she would not have gone to the carpark to throw up but would have thrown up just outside Baliza or in the toilet instead[^84]. I saw no reason for them to lie on this point.

63     Their testimonies were also supported by the evidence of Mr Tan (PW8), who was an independent witness. Mr Tan testified that the Accused’s car had left the car park at 6.12am, which was after Baliza’s closing time of 6.00am and which contradicted the Accused’s claim that they had left Baliza at about 5.45am or 5.50am.

64     I further accepted the Victim’s evidence that the Accused had kissed her momentarily on the lips as they were walking to the car park, behind VT. The allegation that the Accused had kissed her was also apparent in the WhatsApp exchanges between her and VT[^85], and between the Victim and DN[^86]. In relation to the WhatsApp messages to DN, the Victim explained that the Accused had kissed her at the carpark at 6 Raffles Boulevard, and not in the order that was seen in the WhatsApp messages that she sent to DN[^87]. I did not doubt the authenticity of P3 and P4. I shall deal with these WhatsApp messages in greater details in the paragraphs below.

65     In addition, I accepted the explanation that she had not told VT about the incident at the carpark as she did not want to upset VT as she thought that VT and the Accused “were seeing each other”[^88].

66     The Victim had then followed the Accused and VT into the car as she thought that it was a one-off misjudgement on the Accused’s part as the Accused had consumed alcohol while clubbing[^89]. In addition, at that time, she had the understanding with VT that if they were to go clubbing together, they would “stay together, … until they get home (sic)”[^90]. Given the Victim’s frame of mind at that time, I did not think that it was incongruous that she agreed to travel in the Accused’s car after being kissed by the Accused.

#### The amended 2nd Charge and 3rd Charge

67     In relation to the amended 2nd Charge and 3rd Charge, I accepted the Victim’s version of the events for the following reasons:

> (i)     Her ordeal was captured in the contemporaneous messages that she sent to VT at about the time of the assault. That she was surreptitiously, and desperately texting VT was obvious from the multiple typos in the first few messages that she sent to VT, telling her that the Accused was touching her, and asking VT for help[^91]:

>> “What’s Dey doing”

>> “This guy iarohxbinf me”

>> “This guy is touching m whelp me”.

> (ii)     Thereafter, the Victim had taken the first chance that she had to escape from the Accused – when the Accused stopped his car by the side of the road to relieve himself. In her haste, she left her heels behind and walked barefooted to VT’s block.

> (iii)     Her distress was witnessed by DN who saw the Victim crying in the living room that morning as DN was getting ready to go to work.

68     When VT was on the stand, it was put to her by the Defence that Imran did not send the message at page 9 of P3 that she (VT) forwarded to the Victim[^92]. In that message, the Accused wrote:

> “V------a, tell your friend i say sorry anything i did wrong ah last night”

> “I’m too drunk i feel bad also la leave her alone”

> “Barefooted”.

The Defence insinuated that P3 was concocted by the Victim and VT.

69     I rejected the argument as the exchanges between the Victim and VT appeared genuine and spontaneous. Examples include the missed calls from VT, the failure on VT’s part to respond after 7.22am as she had fallen asleep in the toilet. Most importantly, there was no time for the Victim and VT to fabricate the messages – independent evidence showed that the Accused entered the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 at about 6.35am and exited at about 6.42am. While in the vicinity of Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, the Accused started touching the Victim which resulted in the frantic messages sent by the Victim at 6.48am.

70     In its reply submissions, the Defence made a brief mention and suggested that the Victim had wanted to return to VT’s flat to confront her ex-boyfriend who was VT’s cousin[^93], and had fabricated the allegations against the Accused to get VT’s attention[^94]. I did not think that this was a credible argument. First, this was not put to the Victim. It is trite law that any “matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to \[the witness\]”[^95]. The rule in _Browne v Dunn_ (1893) 6 R 67[^96] is clear:

> It seems to me to be _absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made_, and not to take his evidence and passed it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit…

> \[emphasis added\]

71     Second, if it was the Victim’s intention to return to VT’s flat to confront her ex-boyfriend, why was there a need for her to leave the Accused’s car so hastily, so much so that she left her heels behind and had to walk barefooted to VT’s block? Third, if she had wanted to spring a surprise on her ex-boyfriend, why did she have to text VT? She could have just gone to the flat and knocked on the door or rung the doorbell.

72     I next considered the time the Victim had taken to lodge the police report (P1). The offences were committed on 4 March 2018. However, the Victim only lodged a police report on 20 March 2018. She explained that at that point, she was “afraid that \[the Accused\]” might hurt her or destroy her reputation. However, because she kept having nightmares, DN encouraged her to file a report, and finally the Victim did so on 20 March 2018[^97]. The Victim’s explanation was corroborated by the evidence of DN[^98].

#### The Prosecution witnesses were credible

73     Overall, I found the Victim’s evidence to be unusually convincing – her evidence was externally and internally consistent, and her demeanour in court showed that she was still traumatised by the incident. She did not embellish her evidence, was direct and forthright in court. She admitted that she was tipsy on that day, but was aware of her surroundings[^99]. She was clearly affected by the incident and broke down on a couple of occasions when she was giving evidence[^100].

74     Although the Victim might not have been able to pin-point the exact location in relation to the amended 2nd Charge and 3rd Charge, she was certain that it was in the vicinity of Blk 124 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 and was also consistent in her evidence in material aspects, despite rigorous cross-examination. In relation to the location, the Victim had indicated in the map showing the vicinity of Blk 124 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 (P17) the area where she thought she was at the time of the assault. P17 showed at least three car parks in the vicinity of Blk 124 Ang Mo Kin Ave 6 which was within the area marked by the Victim. These were also apparent in the Google map (P6) submitted by the Prosecution. I accepted her testimony explaining why she was unable to pin-point the exact location of the offences – she was in fear and was alone in the car with a man who had just been introduced to her a few hours ago[^101].

75     Contrary to the Defence’s position, I found it inconceivable that the Victim had made a false report against the Accused and had relentlessly pursued the alleged false allegations against him – it was not put to her, VT or DN that the Victim felt upset when she was rebuffed by the Accused, and that the Victim had consumed methamphetamine on the day in question. As for the suggestion that the Victim’s ex-boyfriend had made her lodge the false police report, I rejected this as well – this was even though it was her ex-boyfriend who accompanied her to make a police report[^102]. First, the Victim had clearly moved on from her ex-boyfriend, and is now married with a child. Second, both the Victim and DN had testified that DN was the one who had encouraged the Victim to lodge a police report[^103].

76     It was pointed out by the Defence that, in the police report (P1), the “Location of Incident” was reflected as “5209 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 Presbyterian High School”[^104]. The Victim explained that Presbyterian High School was where the Accused had stopped the car and she had then walked from that spot to VT’s block[^105]. In _Tan Pin Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 3 SLR(R) 494</span> at \[27\], Yong Pung How CJ made the following remarks:

> It is a misconception to regard the first information report or police report as a document which should contain the entire case for the Prosecution. Its main purpose is merely to give information of a cognisable offence to the police so as to set them in motion.

77     I accepted the Victim’s explanation and did not consider this to be inconsistent with the evidence that the she was molested in the car by the Accused while they were in the vicinity of the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, nor did I consider her credibility to be impugned by her failure to give specific details of the assaults. In any event, the exact location of the car was not critical since her evidence was that the assaults had taken place in the car, after VT was dropped off.

78     In relation to the evidence of VT, I accepted that she was a witness of truth as well. While she and the Victim were close in the past, they no longer shared that close relationship by the time the present case proceeded to trial. I therefore did not think that VT would go through this charade if she had indeed collaborated with the Victim to fabricate the false WhatsApp messages against the Accused. In any event, the Defence did not suggest any reason why the Victim and VT would make the false accusations against the Accused after a seemingly enjoyable night out with him.

79     While the Defence tried to submit that VT’s cousin (who was the Victim’s ex-boyfriend) was behind it (who allegedly made the Victim file the police report), clearly there was no opportunity for him to instigate them to fabricate the messages against the Accused since the exchange of messages started soon after VT was dropped off, while the Victim was still in the Accused’s car. Prior to the Victim’s messages to VT at 6.48am, the last message that she sent to VT was at 5.29am, when they were still at Baliza.

80     As for DN, I found no reason to doubt her evidence as well. It was not disputed by the Defence that DN found the Victim in a state of distress on the day in question. This was followed by an exchange of WhatsApp messages between DN and the Victim (P4). I did not doubt the authenticity of the messages and indeed, the Defence did not seem to dispute the authenticity of P4. P4 lent credence to the Victim’s evidence and cast further doubts on the Accused’s initial insinuation that the Victim and VT had fabricated the WhatsApp messages (P3) against him to appease VT’s cousin, who allegedly instigated the Victim to file the police report. If that was the case, I do not see why they would want to drag DN into the fray, and why DN would allow herself to be used.

81     Other than the Victim’s inability to pin-point the exact location in relation to the amended 2nd Charge and 3rd Charge, the Defence also raised certain inconsistencies between the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, for example, the exact location where VT had thrown up.

82     In dealing with discrepancies and/or inconsistencies of this nature, I found the observation made by Abdul Hamid J in _Chean Siong Guat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1969\] 2 MLJ 63</span> at 64 instructive:

> … In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate needs to do is to consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies … On the other hand, if a magistrate finds the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them.

83     The above observation was endorsed by Yong Pung How CJ in _Sundara Moorthy Lankathran v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1997\] 2 SLR(R) 253</span> at \[40\], and Steven Chong J (as he then was) in _Jayasekara Arachchilage Hemantha Neranjan Gamini & anor v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] 3 SLR 689</span> at \[66\]. I did not think that the evidence of these witnesses in relation to the charges against the Accused was undermined in any way by the minor discrepancies and/or inconsistencies. Nor did these discrepancies or inconsistencies affect the veracity of the evidence of the Victim, VT and DN.

84     Having found that the Prosecution had proved the amended charges against the Accused, I next considered the Accused’s defence and whether he had raised a reasonable doubt to the Prosecution’s case.

### The Accused and his witness were not credible witnesses

85     I rejected the Accused’s defence as his evidence was fraught with inconsistencies and, at times, illogical. Some examples are set out below:

> (i)     The Accused attempted to apologise to the Victim through VT[^106]. If the Accused had not done anything wrong, there would not have been a need to apologise to the Victim.

>> In fact, the Defence initially suggested that VT had concocted the messages and pretended that they were from the Accused. However, the Defence subsequently did not pursue this approach when VT testified that she would not have spelt her own name incorrectly (in the message, her name was misspelt[^107]).

>> The Accused then attempted to explain the apology away by saying that he felt bad that the Victim had to walk all the way back to Venessa’s block without her heels. However, there was no reason for him to be apologetic if she had chosen to do so and he was not the cause of her walking barefooted to Venessa’s block.

> (ii)     The Accused claimed that the Victim had consumed methamphetamine, which was an integral part of his defence during the trial. However, that was not put to the Victim, VT or DN even though they were extensively cross-examined, which was again against the rule in _Browne v Dunn_. Not only was this not put to any of the witnesses, the Accused did not mention it in any of the statements that were tendered in court. It is clear to me therefore, that the allegation that the Victim was on methamphetamine was an afterthought.

> (iii)     The Accused claimed that the Victim was upset with him as he had told her off and had also rebuffed her advances. This was likewise, not put to the Victim when she was on the stand. Neither was it put to VT. I was therefore of the view that this allegation was also an afterthought on the Accused’s part. In fact, the Victim said that she thought that VT and the Accused were together at that time and did not want to upset VT by telling her that the Accused had kissed her. I believed her testimony – on that occasion, VT was the Accused’s date and I did not think that the Victim would flirt with the Accused in front of VT, considering the fact that they were such good friends at that time.

> (iv)     Even if the Victim was upset with the Accused (which I disbelieved), there was no reason for her to mount such a vicious allegation against him and for VT to collaborate with her to fabricate evidence against the Accused. Afterall, the Victim had met the Accused for the first time on 4 March 2018. It is inexplicable for her to want to act in such a malicious manner and pursue it for two years.

86     I found that the Accused was dishonest in various aspects of his evidence. I will highlight the main ones:

> (a)     He claimed that his mobile phone was flat and hence VT could not possibly have called him at the time of the offence. However, this was refuted by the Victim’s and VT’s evidence[^108] and by a contemporaneous message that VT sent to the Victim telling the Victim that she (VT) had spoken to the Accused and the Accused said he would send the Victim home[^109].

> (b)     He claimed that he thought he was sending both the Victim and VT to Blk 124 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, where VT was living at that time. This was refuted by the WhatsApp message from VT which said that the Accused had insisted on sending VT home first, before dropping the Victim off[^110].

> (c)     He claimed that they left Baliza before it closed and that the Victim had more than 30 minutes to plan and fabricate the messages to frame him[^111] – from the time VT was dropped off to the time she first messaged VT for help at 6.48am. This was refuted by Mr Tan and Mr Asri. The carpark gantry records showed that the Accused’s car left the Raffles Boulevard car park at about 6.12am[^112], 12 minutes after Baliza’s closed for the day, and entered the Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 carpark at about 6.35am[^113].

> (d)     He claimed that he drove out of the car park at VT’s block immediately after dropping VT off. This was refuted by the evidence of Mr Asri and the Ang Mo Kio Ave 6 car park gantry records which showed that the Accused’s car left the car park after 8 minutes, and which supported the Victim’s evidence that the Accused was driving round the car park before exiting.

> (e)     He claimed that after VT threw up, they had returned to Baliza. This was inconsistent with the Long Statement (D2) recorded by Mr Ng which stated[^114]:

>> … we found her outside Baliza. … We then left the place. As we were walking to the carpark, \[VT\] stopped to vomit. She was in-front of me and \[the Victim\]. I was with \[the Victim\] as I was holding her.

> I disbelieved the Accused’s allegation that he had stated in his Long Statement that they had left Baliza and was going to the carpark because the recording officer, Mr Ng, had allegedly told him to say that[^115]:

>> A:    … So the IO told me, “Never mind, just put you go to the car.”

> There was no reason for Mr Ng to tell the Accused to state that, and the Accused offered no reason why Mr Ng would want him to state that. In any event, the Victim and VT were also clear that they had gone to the Accused’s car after VT threw up. Notably, VT was able to give a cogent reason why they did not go back to Baliza – her explanation was that if they had intended to stay on, she would have thrown up in the toilet or just outside Baliza, and not by the side of the carpark.

> (f)     He claimed that ASP Tan had refused to let him make amendments to his Cautioned Statements. I found it inconceivable that ASP Tan would decline to allow the Accused to make the amendments, if the Accused had indeed wanted to do so. In any event, this was flatly denied by ASP Tan. I accepted ASP Tan’s evidence as there was, similarly, no reason for him to lie.

87     The Accused further claimed that it was not physically possible for him to lift the Victim’s skirt and grab her thigh, nor was it physically possible for him to grab her right hand and put her fingers into his mouth while he was driving. I disagreed with the Accused’s testimony that it was not physically possible for these acts to be done, nor was there any demonstration by the Accused why these acts were physically impossible.

88     As for Ismail’s evidence, I rejected his claim that VT had told him that he disbelieved the Victim, and that the Victim was prone to telling lies. This was not put to VT when she was on the stand. A message which VT sent to the Victim also clearly showed that VT believed the Victim[^116]. In any event, if VT had indeed believed that the Victim was lying, why would VT come to court to testify and subject herself to the stress of being questioned by the Prosecution and the Defence?

### The alleged inadequacies in the investigations

89     In the course of the trial, the Defence raised the point of there being a CCTV at the carpark at 6 Raffles Boulevard. While CCTV footage might strengthen the Prosecution’s case against the Accused, the lack of which was not detrimental to its case, as the Prosecution’s case was based primarily on the evidence of the Victim, VT and DN, all of whom I found to be credible witnesses.

### The Accused was not prejudiced by the amendments to the charges

90     Finally, I considered if the Accused was prejudiced in anyway by the charges being amended after parties had closed their case. The Accused did not deny being with the Victim at the material time – from the time they met at Get Juiced to the time the Victim left his car and walked to VT’s block. However, he denied assaulting the Victim in any way during the time he was with her. Consequently, I was of the view that the amendments to the charges did not prejudice the Accused in any way. In any event, the Prosecution and the Defence were asked if they would like to recall any witnesses pursuant to the amendments, and they declined.

91     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted the Accused accordingly.

## The Sentence

92     An offence under section 354(1) of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of the stated punishments.

93     An offence under section 352 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $1,500, or with both of the stated punishments.

### Antecedents

94     The Accused was untraced.

### Prosecution’s position on sentence

95     In the present case, in relation to the outrage of modesty charges, the Prosecution submitted that the present case fell within Band 1 of the sentencing bands set out in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> at \[45(b)\] and \[48\] (“_Kunasekaran_”). The Prosecution argued that the custodial threshold had been crossed and sought a sentence of at least two months’ imprisonment for the amended 1st Charge and a sentence of at least five months’ imprisonment for the amended 2nd Charge[^117]. In its submissions, the Prosecution highlighted case precedents for similar acts of assault[^118] and said that the key sentencing consideration for such offences was general and specific deterrence[^119].

96     In relation to the use of criminal force offence, the Prosecution submitted for the maximum fine of $1,500.

### The mitigation plea

97     In mitigation, the Defence submitted, _inter alia_:

> (i)     the Accused is married with three young children and was unemployed;

> (ii)     the Accused was a professional football player and had played for Home United Football Club and Tampines Rover Football Club;

> (iii)     the Accused suffered from adjustment disorder due to the court proceedings; and

> (iv)     the Accused was untraced[^120].

98     The Defence submitted that the offences were not pre-meditated, and the Accused did not “put the Victim in a state of fear”, nor was the Victim harmed. The Accused had a right to claim trial and he should not be faulted for claiming trial[^121].

99     The Defence submitted for a global sentence of two months’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,000[^122].

### Decision on sentence

100    In relation to the outrage of modesty charges, the Prosecution and the Defence agreed that the present case fell within Band 1 of the sentencing bands in _Kunasekaran_, and the custodial threshold had not been crossed for the charge involving the use of criminal force.

101    I agreed with the Prosecution and the Defence that a fine was appropriate in relation to the amended 3rd Charge. While the Victim was shocked by the Accused’s actions, she was not injured or physically harmed in any way and I did not think that the maximum fine was warranted. In the circumstances, I agreed with the Defence that a fine of $1,000 was appropriate.

102    I next considered the factors raised by the Prosecution and the Defence in respect of the outrage of modesty charges. The sentencing range for Band 1 is a term of imprisonment of less than five months. The Defence conceded as there was skin-on-skin touching for both charges, “a short imprisonment term was the norm”[^123]. I agreed that a custodial term was warranted.

103    In the present case, the Accused had claimed trial. While it was the Accused’s right to claim trial to the charges, it would mean that the Accused was not entitled to any discount in the sentence, unlike in the case of a first-time offender pleading guilty to his charge in a timeous manner. As pointed out by the Prosecution, the Victim was made to go through “the full rigours of trial and relive the ordeal on the stand”[^124].

104    I did not find any exceptional factors in the mitigation plea. It is well established that, other than in the most exceptional or extreme circumstances, personal or financial hardships carries little mitigating value and “may not be relied on during mitigation” (_Ong Ker Seng v PP_ \[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 406 at \[30\] and _PP v Tan Fook Sum_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 1022</span> at \[31\]).

105    However, I accepted that the Accused had no previous conviction in Singapore and had had contributed to the sporting scene as a professional football player – a term of imprisonment, regardless of its length would leave an indelible mark in his life. I further agreed with the Defence that there did not appear to be any pre-meditation on the Accused’s part when he committed the offences, nor did he cause any physical injuries to the Victim. Nonetheless, “the lack of aggravating factors could not be construed as a mitigating factor”[^125].

106    In relation to the amended 1st Charge, according to the sentencing precedents submitted by the Prosecution, the sentencing range is an imprisonment term of between six weeks and two months for offenders who pleaded guilty and who were either untraced or did not have any similar antecedents. In the present case, the kiss was fleeting, and in the words of the Victim, the Accused had “pecked” her on the lips. While she was taken by surprise, she was able to brush it off. I therefore was of the view that a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment would be fair.

107    As for the amended 2nd charge, I was of the view that the assault in the car was more invasive and egregious – the Accused had molested the Victim in a moving car, thereby reducing her chance of escape. Furthermore, the Accused had touched the Victim’s inner thigh, before grabbing her inner thigh (after lifting her skirt) where it was close to her private parts. However, I gave consideration to the fact that while the charge had reflected that the Accused had stoked her thigh, the Victim’s description was that of a touch, which was less intrusive than a stoke. Based on the sentencing precedents submitted by the Prosecution, the sentencing range for similar acts is a term of imprisonment of between three and four months. While the Accused had claimed trial in the present case, I did not think that the maximum sentence of five months’ imprisonment under Band 1 was warranted, and was of the view that a sentence of 18 weeks’ imprisonment would commensurate the seriousness of the amended 2nd Charge.

108    As both the 1st Charge and 2nd Charge involved the same victim and there was proximity in time, I ordered both imprisonment terms to run concurrently.

## Conclusion

109    I had given careful consideration to the evidence adduced by the Prosecution, and was satisfied that the Prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In my view, a sentence of sentence of 18 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 (in default 5 days’ imprisonment) would adequately reflect the culpability of the Accused and would give sufficient weight to the interest of deterrence.
