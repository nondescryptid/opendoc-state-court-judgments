31 August 2022

### Magistrate Hairul Hakkim:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Mr Krishnan, claimed trial to two charges (“the Charges”) under s 354(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal Code”) for intentionally outraging the modesty of a victim (“the victim”).

2       Following the trial, I convicted the accused of both Charges and sentenced him to a global term of four months’ imprisonment. As the accused has filed an appeal against both his conviction and sentence, I now set out my reasons for both matters in the following grounds of decision.

## The Charges

3       The key particulars of the Charges for the alleged events on 16 August 2019 sometime between 1.00am to 2.00am were as follows:

> (a)     1st Charge: the accused used criminal force on the victim by slipping his hand into the victim’s shorts and squeezing her left buttock twice, intending to outrage her modesty by such criminal force; and

> (b)     2nd Charge: the accused used criminal force on the victim by slipping his hand into the victim’s top to unhook her bra clasp, intending to outrage her modesty by such criminal force.

## The undisputed facts

4       The Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASOF”) was admitted by consent during the first day of trial on 17 February 2022. I reproduce the salient facts from the ASOF and other undisputed facts below.

### The involved parties

5       On 15 August 2019, the accused and the victim were working as part-time waiter/waitresses at Tortuga Tapas, a bar located at 95 East Coast Road.

6       At the material time, Mr Bandara Meepe Ganithage Prabuddha (“Bandara”) was the owner of Tortuga Tapas. Both the accused and the victim reported to him.

7       The final involved party was Mr Sadish s/o Sundaramoorthy (“Sadish”), a bartender working at Tortuga Tapas at the material time.

### Background information on the events surrounding the Charges

8       On 15 August 2019, the victim and the accused reported to work at Tortuga Tapas sometime in the evening. This was the first time the victim met the accused – even though 15 August 2019 was the victim’s second day working at Tortuga Tapas, the accused was not present at Tortuga Tapas during the victim’s first day of work on 13 August 2019. Prior to that, the accused had been working at Tortugas Tapas for approximately a month.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1)

9       During their shift on 15 August 2019, the accused and the victim spoke with each other. At about 9.00pm, the accused asked the victim if she was free to join him for drinks after work. The victim did not initially give the accused a definitive answer. Instead, she asked the accused if anyone else would be joining them and the accused responded that he would ask them separately. At about 10.00pm, after Tortuga Tapas had closed for the day, the accused informed the victim that Bandara and Sadish would also be joining them. After the victim heard that Bandara was going to be present during the drinking session, she agreed to join them.

10     Sometime at about 10.30pm, the victim, the accused, Bandara, Sadish, one Javier (who used to work at Tortuga Tapas), and Javier’s girlfriend, sat outside Tortugas Tapas to chat and drink alcoholic beverages. The accused sat directly beside the victim. Sometime after midnight, on 16 August 2019, Javier and his girlfriend left the group. Bandara then suggested to the accused and the victim to go to a bar nearby to continue drinking. They agreed. Bandara then brought the accused and the victim to Check It Out Pub & Café (“Check It Out Pub”), which was located at 61 East Coast Road. Sadish did not join the group at Check It Out Pub.

11     At about 12.40am to 12.50am on 16 August 2019, when Check It Out Pub was about to close, the accused, the victim and Bandara decided to proceed to Lower East Side Tacqueria (“Lower East Side”), a bar in the vicinity located at 19 East Coast Road. The accused sat beside the victim on the highchair and table near the entrance of Lower East Side. Shortly after, Bandara left the table to drink with his friends who were seated inside Lower East Side and away from where the victim and the accused were. At this point, the accused and the victim were seated alone at the table just outside Lower East Side during which time the alleged incidents in both Charges took place. From the time the victim reported to work on 15 August 2019 to the early morning of 16 August 2019, the victim was wearing a black top with blue denim shorts.

12     Sometime between 1.00am and 2.00am on 16 August 2019, the victim left the table and went to a toilet located inside Lower East Side. When the victim exited the toilet, she saw the accused standing outside the toilet area. The accused and the victim then went back to their table. Shortly after, the victim walked away from the table to make a call. The accused offered to share a ride with the victim on the private car hire service provider, “Grab”, to his place, which the victim declined.

13     Tortuga Tapas, Check It Out Pub and Lower East Side were, at the material time, located along the same stretch of the road along East Coast Road and were within walking distance of each other.

### First information report

14     On 20 August 2019 at about 12:25am, the victim made a police report at Kampong Java Neighbourhood Police Centre, stating that she had been “sexually assaulted” at Lower East Side.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

## The Prosecution’s case

15     The Prosecution’s case outlined the sequence of events as follows.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) After their work shift had ended at about 10.30pm on 15 August 2019, the victim agreed to join the accused and their boss, Bandara, to drink. At this point, the accused had promised to pay for the victim’s transport back home. While waiting for the shop to be closed by Bandara and Sadish, the victim testified that the accused had initiated the first instance of unwanted contact against her by touching her waist and chin. Thereafter, while the victim and the accused were drinking at Tortuga Tapas, the accused placed his hands on the victim’s thigh, following which the victim pushed his hands away.

16     Subsequently, the accused, the victim and Bandara proceeded to Check It Out Pub. Here, the victim testified that the accused tapped her left thigh twice to ask her to drink up on one occasion.

17     Next, when the accused, the victim and Bandara proceeded to Lower East Side, they sat at a high table on the left to the entrance of Lower East Side, whereupon Bandara said that he would proceed inside to order drinks. However, Bandara did not at any point return to join them. The Prosecution’s case, based on the victim’s testimony, is that it was here that the accused committed the offences as described in the Charges.

18     In relation to the 1st Charge, while the victim was seated at the high table and the accused was standing behind her, she suddenly felt the accused’s hand under her shorts over her panties and felt two squeezes on her left buttock. At this point, the victim stood up and the accused then withdrew his hand. She told him that she was going to the toilet and asked him to take care of her bag at the table. He asked if he needed to follow her to the toilet but she said no. The victim came up with an excuse that she needed to go to the toilet because she wanted to contact her parents and friend, Mr Andy Sng Teck Siong (“Andy”).

19     The victim called Andy at 1.29am[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) before entering the toilet but Andy did not answer the call.[^5] After the victim had entered the toilet, she observed that, despite her request to watch over her bag, the accused had followed her and was just outside the toilet cubicle. While the victim was still inside the toilet, she texted Andy instead between 1.32am to 1.36am, informing Andy that she had been molested and requesting him to pick her up.[^6] Andy agreed to do so. While waiting for Andy, the victim went back to the same table as her bag was left there unattended. The accused followed the victim to sit at the table but they were thereafter not talking to each other. Shortly thereafter, the victim suddenly felt a hand under her shirt on her bra clasp. She turned and saw that the accused, who was standing behind her at that point, was fiddling with her bra clasp and trying to unclasp it. She then stood up and told the accused she was going to call her father. Instead of her father, she called Andy at 1.38am.[^7]

20     The accused then came over and offered to book a Grab ride to his house at Sengkang, so that they could “chill under his block”, after which the accused would book another Grab ride to her house. She replied that her father would be fetching her, before walking away. She had specified her father instead of Andy (who would be the one picking her up) as she thought that the accused would be more apprehensive towards her father. The victim then went away to call Andy again at 1:40am[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) whilst the accused went to sit at a grass patch nearby.

21     Andy subsequently arrived at the scene to pick the victim up at around 2.05am. The victim pretended that both Andy and her were a couple and the victim kissed Andy on the cheek.

22     The victim also texted her former boyfriend on 16 August 2019[\[note: 9\]](#Ftn_9) and Bandara on 18 August 2019[^10] to inform them of the incident. She also uploaded Instagram stories on her Instagram profile from 19 to 20 August 2019 (“Instagram stories”) where she recounted the above incident in some detail.[^11]

## The Defence’s case

23     The Defence did not dispute the sequence of events in the Prosecution’s case, save that the accused denied making any unwanted contact with the victim throughout the night of 15 August 2019 and morning of 16 August 2019. He claimed to have only touched the victim’s chin[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12) and tapped her knee and hip over her clothes.[^13] Particularly, in relation to both the Charges, the Defence’s case is simply one of bare denial.

24     While the precise arguments made by the Defence were not expressly clear from its written submissions, I discerned the following principal arguments in relation to the Charges from the submissions:

> (a)     The victim’s behaviour was incompatible with that of a typical victim. She did not directly confront the accused, alert Bandara or anyone in the vicinity. She even went to have supper with Andy after the incident.

> (b)     Andy was an unhelpful witness because he did not witness the alleged acts and he was unable to recollect many details.

> (c)     There were some inconsistences with the victim’s testimony in court and the Instagram stories she had posted.

> (d)     It was physically impossible for the accused to have committed the actions alleged in the Charges.

> (e)     The victim wanted to frame the accused to seek attention on her social media.

## Assessing the victim’s evidence

### The applicable legal principles

25     One preliminary question was whether I needed to find that the victim’s testimony was “unusually convincing” to find the accused to be guilty of the Charges. The law in this regard is straightforward. This standard is only required where the complainant’s _uncorroborated_ evidence forms the sole basis for the conviction: see, _eg_, the decisions in _Public Prosecutor v GCK and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_GCK_”) at \[87\] and _Public Prosecutor v Mohammed Liton Mohammed Syeed Mallik_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] 1 SLR(R) 601</span> (“_Liton_”) at \[37\].

26     In _Liton_, the Court of Appeal confirmed that a more liberal approach to corroboration (as opposed to the stricter standard which requires _independent_ evidence) is adopted in Singapore. In the words of the Court of Appeal, “\[w\]hat is important is the substance as well as the relevance of the evidence, and whether it is supportive or confirmative of the weak evidence which it is meant to corroborate” (see _Liton_ at \[43\]). What this means is that the court can in an appropriate case consider a complainant’s statement or account of events to another as corroborative of the complainant’s evidence in court: see, _eg_, _AOF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> at \[173\], citing _Public Prosecutor v Mardai_ <span class="citation">\[1950\] MLJ 33</span> at 33.

27     Indeed, this principle is enshrined in s 159 of the Evidence Act 1893, which reads as follows:

> **Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same fact**

> 159.  In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.

### Main findings on victim’s credibility

28     Applying these principles, I found the text messages sent to Andy and her former boyfriend, the Instagram stories as well as the WhatsApp messages sent to Bandara to be materially corroborative of the victim’s testimony in court (as outlined in the Prosecution’s case above at \[15\]–\[21\]). In particular, I should highlight that the most corroborative piece of evidence was the contemporaneous text messages exchanged with Andy _moments_ after the incident in the 1st Charge between 1.31am and 1.35am as follows:[\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

> 
| 

Victim (“V”):

 | 

bro i calling \[because\] i need help can u \[please\] come down \[_sic_\]

 |
| 

Andy (“A”):

 |

 |
| 

V:

 | 

this guy keep touching me … worker … pls

 |
| 

A:

 | 

\[what the fuck\] \[_sic_\]

 |
| 

V:

 |

 |
| 

A:

 |

 |
| 

V:

 |

 |
| 

A:

 |

 |
| 

V:

 |

…

 |
| 

A:

 |
| 

A:

 | 

\[what the fuck\] \[_sic_\]

 |
| 

V:

 | 

\[Please please\] \[_sic_\]

 |

  
  

29     It was clear from my reading of these messages that the accused had made inappropriate contact with the victim, which is why she decided to hide herself in the toilet and contacted Andy to come to her rescue.

30     In addition to the above, the following pieces of evidence lent further corroboration to the victim’s testimony:[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

> (a)     The text messages sent by the victim to her former boyfriend on 16 August 2019,[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) in which she recounted being touched by a “co\[-\]worker” on the “ass”, her response to “keep pushing him away”, the co-worker’s act of booking a Grab ride to his area in Sengkang, the co-worker’s act of “roaming around” when the victim went to the toilet, and the co-worker’s act of asking him to look at him.

> (b)     The WhatsApp messages sent by the victim to Bandara on 18 August 2019,[\[note: 17\]](#Ftn_17) in which she recounted to Bandara the accused’s acts of touching her “at places that he shouldn’t touch … like grabbing of my ass \[under\] my pants and … trying to unclasp my bra with his hands \[under\] my shirt”. During this conversation, the victim also requested to avoid working together with the accused during her shifts.

> (c)     The Instagram stories uploaded by the victim on her Instagram profile from 19 to 20 August 2019,[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) in which she meticulously detailed every step of her ordeal.

31     Overall, in my judgment and careful assessment, I found that these pieces of evidence (_ie_, the text messages sent to Andy and her former boyfriend, the Instagram stories as well as the WhatsApp messages exchanged with Bandara) materially corroborated the following evidence of the victim:

> (a)     The accused made inappropriate contact with the victim and, in particular, had inserted his hands into the victim’s shorts to grab her buttocks.

> (b)     The victim went to hide in the toilet whereupon the accused was roaming outside the toilet.

> (c)     The accused thereafter went under the victim’s shirt and tried to unclasp her bra with his hands under her shirt.

### Whether the victim was unusually convincing

32     In addition to my findings above, I found the victim’s evidence to be “unusually convincing” such that, even in the absence of any corroborative evidence, her testimony alone was sufficiently credible to justify a finding of guilt for the accused on both Charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

33     In _GCK_ (at \[88\]), the Court of Appeal helpfully observed, quoting from _Liton_ at \[39\], that a complainant’s testimony would be “unusually convincing” if the testimony:

> ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused’.

> The relevant considerations in this regard include the witness’ demeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the witness’s evidence.

34     No arguments were pursued by the Defence on the victim’s demeanour. As for internal consistency, the victim was clear and consistent throughout the trial, including during cross-examination, that the accused had outraged her modesty as described in the Charges. She had no doubt as to the nature of allegations and was also careful in her testimony when noting that the accused did not make skin-to-skin contact with her on either occasion in the Charges.

35     In addition to the points made above in relation to corroboration, I also found the victim’s evidence to be externally consistent with the following:

> (a)     First, her evidence was consistent with the victim’s call record history with Andy, which disclosed that the victim called Andy on three occasions on 16 August 2019, specifically at 1.29am, 1.38am and 1.40am.[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19) Simply put, it was not disputed by the Defence that the accused had agreed to send the victim back – in the circumstances, there was little to no reason for the victim to suddenly contact Andy and additionally to lie to the accused that her father would be coming to pick her up (see \[20\] above). Something must have happened between the pair that could explain the change – the accused did not suggest any other possibilities in his testimony that could have led the victim to suddenly change her plans.

> (b)     Second, her version of events was consistent with the eyewitnesses’ recollection of the victim’s mental state soon after she had been molested. Andy testified that the victim sounded distressed over the phone when talking to her.[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20) After Andy arrived at the scene to pick the victim up on 16 August 2019 at around 2.05am, Andy described the victim to be “really panicky”, “stunned” and “shocked”. Even the Defence’s own witness, Bandara, testified that the victim looked “a little bit … off”, when he saw the victim again at Lower East Side.[^21]

> (c)     Third, Andy testified that the victim had pointed to a person who was sitting by the grass patch (_ie_, the accused) to identify who had touched her inappropriately. Andy also confirmed that either the victim had asked him to kiss her or that she had kissed him[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22) (compare with victim’s evidence at \[21\] above).

36     In a similar vein, the victim’s testimony was also consistent with the accused’s behaviour after the offence – despite the accused’s version in court that nothing wrong had transpired between them,[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) he did not contact the victim after the incident, not even to ask if she had reached home safely that night[^24] (bearing in mind the undisputed prior agreement for the accused to send the victim back[^25]). The first time he contacted the victim was only three days after the incident on 19 August 2019 and that was only to confront the victim regarding her Instagram stories.

37     Finally, it was also telling that the accused had apologised and tried to reconcile with the victim when he messaged her on 20 August 2019 as follows: “can we talk things out” and “I’m sorry too”.[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) The accused tried to explain the latter statement by suggesting that he was apologising to the victim for possibly offending her through his words.[^27] I found this explanation to be simply incredible given that there was nothing in their exchange on Instagram that could be deemed to be offensive. Neither was there any suggestion by the accused that he had been verbally offensive in any way during their interaction from 15 to 16 August 2019.

### Weighing the respective testimonies of the accused and victim

38     In addition, where it is a case of one person’s word against another’s, the Court of Appeal in _GCK_ noted that, when evaluating the totality of the evidence to determine whether a reasonable doubt arises, the “unusually convincing” standard sets the threshold for a witness’s testimony to be preferred over the evidence put forth by the accused (at \[149(g)\]).

39     In this regard, as compared to the victim’s version of events, which has been substantially corroborated as discussed above, I found the accused’s version of events to be entirely uncorroborated. Even the only other witness called by the Defence, Bandara, was not able to shed much light on the Defence’s case – Bandara agreed that he was not seated at the table where the accused and victim were seated. Bandara went to join his friends at another table at Lower East Side while the accused and the victim were seated at a table located outside Lower East Side.[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28) Bandara confirmed that he had no ”clear line of sight” of either the victim or the accused from where he was seated at Lower East Side.[^29] If at all, Bandara’s testimony that the victim looked “a little bit … off” when he saw her again soon after the incident (see \[35(b)\] above) supported the victim’s evidence rather than the Defence’s case theory of bare denial.

40     In addition, I found the accused’s credit to be impeached given the material inconsistencies between his statement to the police recorded on 21 August 2019[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30) (five days after the incident) and his testimony in court. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that the following inconsistencies were material:

> (a)      Whether the accused touched the victim’s thighs and/or waist: The accused testified that he _never_ touched the victim’s thighs or waist throughout the entire night.[\[note: 31\]](#Ftn_31) However, in his statement to the police, the accused categorically stated that “the only two places of her body that I touched … would be her waist and thigh area”.[^32] In particular, in his statement, the accused admitted to have placed his whole palm on the victim’s thigh and to have touched her bare skin on the thighs (the victim was wearing shorts at the time).[^33]

> (b)      Whether the accused touched the victim’s back: The accused made it clear in his testimony that he _never_ touched the victim’s back throughout the night.[\[note: 34\]](#Ftn_34) The converse was captured in his statement with some level of details (including recollections of his conversation) as follows: “I did touch her back, while I was facing her back. I placed both my hands on her middle back area and asked her if she was okay, if everything is okay, if there were any problems.”[^35] \[_sic_\]

> (c)      Whether the accused mentioned details of Grab booking: The accused testified that he _never_ specified which location would be the first drop-off point when he agreed to share a Grab ride with the victim.[\[note: 36\]](#Ftn_36) However, his statement read as follows: “I offered to stay with her to wait for her transport when we arrive at _my_ place”[^37] \[emphasis added\]. In fact, it was also his statement to the police that was consistent with the ASOF (see \[12\] above) as opposed to his version in court.

41     I agreed with the Prosecution that these inconsistences were material and were in stark contrast to his testimony in court. The Defence did not dispute the voluntariness of the accused’s statement. Nor was any application made to question the statement-recorder to dispute the accuracy of the statement. I accordingly found that the accused’s feeble attempts to correct his statement were simply an afterthought. It was also telling that the Defence, despite requesting to file reply submissions, failed to respond in its reply to any of the inconsistencies highlighted by the Prosecution in its closing submissions.[\[note: 38\]](#Ftn_38)

42     Overall, in my holistic assessment of the victim’s evidence against the backdrop of the available evidence (including the evidence of the accused), I was satisfied that her evidence contained the “ring of truth” (see \[33\] above, citing _GCK_ at \[88\]) and found her to be an “unusually convincing” witness.

## Analysis on Defence’s arguments

43     In attempting to raise a reasonable doubt for both Charges, the Defence mounted numerous arguments. At the outset, I must observe that several of the arguments made by the Defence were either incoherent or incomplete. In the analysis below, I address five relevant arguments that could be discerned from the submissions tendered.

44     First, the primary argument of the Defence appeared to be that the victim’s behaviour was incompatible with that of a typical victim because:

> (a)     the victim did not directly confront the accused regarding his actions at any point;

> (b)     she did not complain to others in the vicinity or to her boss, Bandara, or call the police;

> (c)     she went back to sit at the same table with the accused after the incident in the 1st Charge;

> (d)     despite the accused’s actions, she was able to have supper with Andy after the incident; and

> (e)     she delayed reporting of the offences as she only made a police report about four days after the incident.

45     To address these arguments, I set out first some general observations made by the Supreme Court in response to similar arguments.

46     First, in the High Court decision of _GBR v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1048</span> (“_GBR_”), See Kee Oon J observed as follows at \[20\]:

> 20    I should add that I saw absolutely no merit in the appellant’s insinuation that the victim must have been making false allegations against him because her behaviour at and around the time of the alleged offence was **_atypical_** of a victim of a sexual crime. I shared the district judge’s view … that _victims of sexual crimes cannot be straitjacketed in the expectation that they must act or react in a certain manner_. … \[emphasis added in italics and bold italics\]

47     Second, in _Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 749</span>, Aedit Abdullah J remarked as follows in relation to delayed reporting by victims of sexual offences at \[30\]:

> I accepted that _victims of sexual offences may not behave in a stereotypical way_. Many victims report their sexual abuse early to a family member, friend, the police, or other person in authority. However, _there is no general rule requiring victims of sexual offences to report the offences immediately or in a timely fashion_. Instead, the explanation for any such delay in reporting is to be considered and assessed by the court on _a case-by-case basis_ (see _DT v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 2 SLR(R) 583</span> at \[62\]; _Tang Kin Seng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 3 SLR(R) 444</span> at \[79\]). While I accept that an omission to report the offence in a timely fashion, in the absence of other evidence, may in certain circumstances make it difficult to establish a case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, I emphasise that _the effect of any delay in reporting always falls to be assessed on the specific facts of each individual case_. \[emphasis added\]

These observations were endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v Mohd Ariffan bin Mohd Hassan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 2 SLR 490</span> at \[68\].

48     What these observations make clear is that there is no such thing as an expected or typical response to be expected from a victim of a sexual offence. What is more germane is an assessment on the facts of each case as to whether the victim’s behaviour was “well within the realm of possibilities” (_GBR_ at \[20\]).

49     Applying this standard, the victim’s behaviour must be understood in the context of this case. Even though that night was her first encounter with the accused, the accused was nonetheless her colleague. Further, that evening was only the victim’s second day working at Tortuga Tapas, as compared to the accused who had already been working with Bandara for some time prior to the incident (see \[8\] above). It was therefore believable for her to have been hesitant to have approached Bandara (as she had testified, Bandara might choose to believe the accused instead).[\[note: 39\]](#Ftn_39) It was also reasonable for the victim to not have made a scene immediately after the incident by confronting the accused or seeking help from others. In this connection, the victim explained at various junctures during cross-examination that she is not a “confrontational person”.[^40] Instead, what she did (_ie_, to excuse herself from the accused to go to the washroom to contact Andy for help) was, in my judgment, a validly possible response in the circumstances.

50     As for her returning to the same seat, this was again entirely explicable given that her bag was then left unattended at her seat.[\[note: 41\]](#Ftn_41) It was also relevant to point out here that she did not have money to go back home at that time and was therefore waiting for Andy to fetch her.[^42] It was also not outside the realm of possibilities for the victim to have supper with Andy – both the victim and Andy testified that the idea for the supper came from Andy who wanted to comfort the victim after her harrowing experience.[^43]

51     In relation to her delayed report, the victim explained that she hesitated to report initially because she was worried about backlash from her family.[\[note: 44\]](#Ftn_44) She eventually decided to lodge the report after some persuasion from her social circle.[^45] Again, there was nothing untoward about this in my judgment, especially since the delay in reporting was only _four days_. Further and in any event, the evidence was clear that she started to relay the incident on both social media as well as her messages to her former boyfriend and Bandara immediately or very soon after the incident (see \[30\] above).

52     Second, it was contended by Defence that Andy was an unhelpful witness because he did not witness the incident and was also unsure of or could not remember many details. In my judgment, this was to be expected given the considerable passage of time (_ie_, Andy gave his evidence in court about two and a half years after the incident). It would also be unrealistic to expect someone in a position of Andy to remember all the details on the night, especially since he was only a third-party to the incident and he had not been personally violated (as compared to the victim). What was more significant instead was that Andy was able to substantially corroborate the victim’s testimony and was able to recall that the victim looked “stunned” and “shocked” when he had met her.[\[note: 46\]](#Ftn_46) Andy had also importantly recalled that after he had reached the incident location, the victim had pointed out to the accused as the person who had molested her.[^47]

53     Third, the Defence contended that there were inconsistences with the victim’s testimony and the Instagram stories. In particular, it was highlighted that one of the Instagram stories documented that the accused only “tried finding” the bra clasp as opposed to her version in court where the victim was certain that the accused had actually _touched_ her bra clasp and had also attempted to “unclasp” her bra.[\[note: 48\]](#Ftn_48) In my judgment, this was really a minor inconsistency of semantics which was confidently explained by the victim to be an erroneous reference in her Instagram stories[^49] – she explained that what she meant by “tried finding” was actually “tried undoing”.[^50] There was no doubt in her mind that the accused had touched her bra clasp. Further, as the Prosecution highlighted, these two words were not entirely inconsistent – one must first _locate_ the bra clasp before attempting to undo it. This apparent inconsistency must also be appreciated in the light of how quickly all these actions had unfolded.[^51]

54     Fourth, the Defence suggested that the victim’s allegations on the accused’s actions were physically _impossible_. This was contended on two levels. The first argument here was that it would not have been possible for the accused to have committed all the actions detailed in the Charges because the victim could have stopped it. More specifically, in relation to the 1st Charge, it was suggested that the accused could not have squeezed the victim’s buttocks twice without her noticing because she was wearing shorts that were tight-fitting. As for the 2nd Charge, it was contended that the accused could not have gone underneath the victim’s top to touch her bra clasp without her realising. I deal with the arguments in respect of the Charges in turn.

55     For the 1st Charge, the victim explained that she was _leaning_ forward towards the table when the accused had entered through her shorts.[\[note: 52\]](#Ftn_52) As she had explained, this would clearly have allowed for “some gap” for the accused to exploit.[^53] The victim further took pains to explain during cross-examination that the contact was sudden because she did not realise that the accused was standing behind her; she thought that the accused had went to smoke.[^54] She also explained that the contact happened “\[v\]ery fast”.[^55] Taken together, her version of events that the accused managed to unexpectedly place his hands underneath her shorts from behind and squeeze her buttocks twice was therefore possible.

56     Similarly, for the 2nd Charge, the victim explained that she did not feel the accused’s hands underneath her shirt before he reached the bra clasp because she was leaning forward to use her phone[\[note: 56\]](#Ftn_56) and assumed her shirt movements were simply due to the wind – she only realised the contact from the accused when she felt her bra clasp moving.[^57]

57     The second argument on physical impossibility pursued by the Defence concerned only the 1st Charge, where it was suggested that as the victim’s shirt was tucked in throughout, the accused could not have reached underneath her shorts to squeeze her buttocks. In my judgment, I struggled to see how the accused had such clear memory of a relatively minor detail concerning the victim’s shirt throughout, particularly whether it was tucked in or not. Further, despite the materiality of this allegation to the accused’s defence, the reference to her shirt being tucked in throughout was conspicuously absent from his statement recorded by the police. In any event, this was simply a bare assertion by the accused, which he was unable to substantiate in any way. The Defence’s other witness, Bandara, also had no recollection on whether the victim’s shirt was tucked in.[\[note: 58\]](#Ftn_58)

58     Lastly, it was argued that the victim’s motive to frame the accused was to seek attention on her social media because she regularly posted on other social issues such as animal abuse, rape cases and woman rights. However, this motive was never put to the victim and the latter evidence on what the victim frequently posted was nothing but evidence from the bar. The Defence also suggested that the victim’s account was simply a figment of her imagination but this was again never put to the victim. I reiterate here that the burden is on the defence to specifically prove motive for a false allegation by a witness (see _GCK_ at \[102\]). All in all, I had no reason to find that the victim had any motive to falsely frame the accused. It was undisputed that the alleged incidents in both Charges took place during the first meeting between the victim and the accused. There was no evidence before me of the pair having any prior bad blood. Nor was it suggested by the accused that their first and only encounter on 15 August 2019 was unpleasant.

59     For these reasons, I found that the arguments raised by the Defence clearly fell short of raising any reasonable doubt in relation to either of the Charges and accordingly found the accused to be guilty and convicted him on both Charges.

60     I turn now to explain my decision on sentence.

## Sentence

61     The Prosecution submitted for a sentence of four to five months’ imprisonment for each Charge, while the Defence submitted for a global term of four weeks’ imprisonment.

62     In arriving at the sentence for this case, I was guided by the sentencing benchmarks set by the High Court in _Kunasekaran s/o Kalimuthu Somasundara v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 580</span> (''_Kunasekaran_'') for an offence under s 354(1) of the Penal Code. These benchmarks were directly applicable as the accused’s offences took place before the enhancement in sentence arising from legislative amendments to s 354(1) of the Penal Code 1871 in March 2022.

63     Both the Prosecution and the Defence agreed on the following:

> (a)     Both Charges fall within Band 1 of the approach in _Kunasekaran_ and the custodial threshold is crossed in this case.

> (b)     The sentence for both Charges should run concurrently as they formed part of the same transaction.

64     Chan Seng Onn J in _Kunasekaran_ held that the following three offence-specific factors laid down by See J (in the context of an offence under s 354(2) of the Penal Code) in _GBR_ equally apply to an offence under s 354(1) of the Penal Code in ascertaining which band the offence falls under (at \[48\]):

> (a)     the degree of sexual exploitation: this includes considerations of the part of the victim’s body the accused touched, how the accused touched the victim, and the duration of the outrage of modesty;

> (b)     the circumstances of the offence: these include considerations of: (i) the presence of premeditation; (ii) the use of force or violence; (iii) the abuse of a position of trust; (iv) the use of deception; (v) the presence of other aggravating acts accompanying the outrage of modesty; and (vi) the exploitation of a vulnerable victim; and

> (c)     the harm caused to the victim, whether physical or psychological, which would usually be set out in a victim impact statement.

65     I agreed with the Defence that there was no evidence of any exceptional harm caused to the victim in the present case, particularly in the absence of any victim impact statement.

66     Nevertheless, even in the absence of this third offence-specific factor, I found that the accused’s actions for the 1st Charge, wherein he had slipped his hand under the victim’s shorts and squeezed her buttocks over her panties twice, fell within the upper end of Band 1. This was due to both the moderately high degree of sexual exploitation as well as the circumstances of the offence.

67     In relation to the degree of sexual exploitation, the accused did not simply touch the victim’s buttocks. He had inserted his hands into the victim’s shorts, while standing behind her (catching her off-guard), and squeezed her buttocks twice. The action of inserting his hands into the victim’s shorts to squeeze her buttocks to increase his gratification correspondingly entailed a significantly higher degree of _intrusion_ than the mere touching of a victim’s buttocks over the shorts.

68     As for the circumstances of the offence, while there may be no direct evidence of premeditation, I took into account his earlier physical contacts with the victim, which had progressively escalated from touching of her chin and waist to then her thigh (skin-to-skin) (see \[15\]–\[16\] and \[40(a)\]). Indeed, I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the accused had been testing boundaries with the victim throughout the night and became increasingly emboldened by the victim’s lack of _stereotypical_ response to his inappropriate inactions (_eg_, alerting Bandara or directly confronting him). He eventually decided to insert his hands into the victim’s shorts when the two of them were isolated and away from the sight of Bandara.

69     Given the intensity of both these offence-specific factors, I found that the offence clearly fell within the upper end of Band 1 and attracted a starting point of between three to four months’ imprisonment.

70     As for offender-specific aggravating factors, I disagreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the accused’s “evident lack of remorse” should be considered as an aggravating factor. As noted by V K Rajah JA in _Thong Sing Hock v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 3 SLR(R) 47</span> at \[61\]:

> …It is axiomatic that an offender cannot be punished more severely simply because a judge suspects or even believes, on a balance of probabilities, that he may not be remorseful. However, I am of the view that an offender's lack of remorse can be a valid aggravating factor if the court is satisfied _beyond reasonable doubt_ that the offender is unremorseful. Although a court should be slow to infer a lack of remorse, it should not hesitate to do so in a clear case. I would caution that an accused _should not_ be penalised for exercising his right to claim trial or for maintaining his innocence at trial or for appealing against a decision. As noted in _Kuek Ah Lek v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 766</span> at \[65\]:

>> ... An accused is entitled to claim trial. _Although an accused who pleads guilty may usually expect a discount, it does not follow that the court can impose a heavier sentence merely because he had elected to contest the charges instead. The mere fact of claiming trial is not an aggravating circumstance_. As the appellant had not unnecessarily prolonged his trial, there was no aggravating circumstance at all. \[emphasis added\]

> \[emphasis in original\]

71     While the Defence did cast unfounded aspersions on the victim’s motive, I did not think the trial was unnecessarily prolonged as a result and I was therefore hesitant to make any finding on evident lack of remorse beyond a reasonable doubt.

72     The Defence readily accepted that the accused’s voluntary intoxication was an offender-specific aggravating factor in this case (see also _Wong Hoi Len v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> at \[44\]). Lastly, the fact the accused was untraced was merely a neutral factor for which no mitigating weight can be attached (see _Kunasekaran_ at \[65\]).

73     Accordingly, I found that four months’ imprisonment was appropriate for the 1st Charge.

74     As for the 2nd Charge, I found that three months’ imprisonment was appropriate. Here, I considered the fact that the degree of intrusion was lower as he had contacted a less sensitive area (_ie_, the victim’s bra clasp on the victim’s back). Nevertheless, a starting point of around the higher middle end of Band 1 was still appropriate here given the following:

> (a)     The accused had inserted his hands _underneath_ the victim’s shirt when committing this offence. Similar to my analysis on the 1st Charge (see \[67\] above), this entailed a higher degree of intrusion than a touch over the victim’s top.

> (b)     This offence was committed soon after the first offence, following which the victim had expressed her discomfort by immediately excusing her from the accused’s presence. Despite that, the accused displayed persistent brazenness in molesting the victim for the second time in quick succession.

75     I also found it appropriate for both imprisonment sentences to run concurrently as they formed part of the same transaction. The overall sentence for the accused was accordingly four months’ imprisonment.

## Conclusion

76     Before I conclude, I feel compelled to express my disappointment with the way the Defence had prepared the written submissions in this case. In particular, the Defence’s Closing Submissions for trial left much to be desired – the submissions were replete with spelling and grammatical errors and had several paragraphs with incomprehensible drafting.

77     In particular, I need to highlight that even though the Prosecution’s Closing Submissions were filed on 29 April 2022, Mr A Revi Shanker only indicated belatedly on 29 May 2022 that he wished to file reply submissions and requested for two further weeks at that juncture to file the reply. This was even though the verdict for this case was originally fixed for 9 June 2022. In the interests of justice, I indulged Mr Shanker’s request to file the reply submissions within a week but he was again late in doing so. These actions necessitated for the verdict to be postponed to a later date.
