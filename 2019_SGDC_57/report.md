\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9068/2019/01\]

29 March 2019

### District Judge Olivia Low:

## Introduction

1       The accused, Parti Liyani, a 45 year-old female Indonesian national, claimed trial to one charge of theft as a servant and three charges of theft in dwelling under sections 381 and 380 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) respectively. One charge under section 35(1) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order & Nuisance) Act was stood down at the start of the trial.

2       I amended the 2nd charge DAC 931428-2017 at the end of the trial and I found the accused guilty and convicted on all four charges. I sentenced the accused to a total of 26 months’ imprisonment. The accused is currently on bail pending appeal. As at the date of this judgment, no appeal has been filed by the prosecution.

## The Prosecution’s case

4       The accused was employed by Mr Liew and worked as a foreign domestic worker in the Liew household between March 2007 and 28 October 2016.

5       The four victims are Mr Liew Mun Leong (“Mr Liew”), his daughter Liew Cheng May (“May”), his son Karl Liew (“Karl”), and Karl’s wife Heather Lim (“Heather”). Mr Liew, his wife Mdm Ng Lai Peng (“Mdm Ng”), Karl, Heather and their children also lived in the house. Karl and his family moved out of the house in March 2016.

6       The accused was not badly treated and admitted that she had a cordial relationship with the Liew family and they often gave her generous red packets on special and festive occasions.[^1] Her starting monthly salary was initially $300 but by the end of her employment in 2016, her monthly salary was $600.[^2] It is not in dispute that she had arguments with Karl in the past over her refusal to do household chores for him.[^3]

## Events of 28 October 2016

7       In October 2016, Mr Liew decided to terminate the accused’s employment.[^4] He had discovered that items had gone missing in the household over the years and suspected that the accused had stolen the items. These included Longchamp bags, shoes and a specially designed power bank, although the shoes and power bank were not the subject matter of the charges as they were never recovered. As Mr Liew was overseas, he instructed Karl to oversee the accused’s termination and repatriation to Indonesia.

8       Karl arranged for representatives from the employment agency to be present on the day of repatriation, 28 October 2016. On the morning of 28 October 2016, Karl informed the accused that her employment was terminated without giving her reasons and she was given two to three hours to pack her belongings. Two to three months’ salary was also given to the accused as compensation for her termination. The accused demanded to know the reason for her termination and got upset with Karl even to the extent of accusing him of being a very bad person and that God (Allah) would punish him.[^5]

9       Karl went out and came back a few hours later where the accused demanded that he pay for three jumbo boxes of items to be shipped to her home.[^6] These were boxes that one of the drivers Ismail had been sent to purchase. Karl refused initially but the employment agency representatives then stepped in to advise that the matter be resolved amicably and that Karl could offer to pay for the three boxes which he agreed to.

10     The two drivers, Robin and Ismail had helped the accused with the packing of her items. The accused threw items she wanted to pack into the boxes on the floor and Robin and Ismail would help place the items into the jumbo boxes. The accused sealed the first box securely and wrote her shipping address on the box. For the other two boxes, Robin and Ismail helped tape up the box in the accused’s presence as the accused had no time because the agency representatives had returned to fetch her by then. The accused then left the house with the agency representatives and returned to Indonesia.

## Events post-28 October 2016

11     Mdm Ng mentioned to Karl that she saw one of Mr Liew’s Japanese brand thermal wear still unopened in its packaging when the accused was packing her items.[^7] Mdm Ng asked the accused if the item belonged to Mr Liew but was told that it had been purchased from a second-hand shop and Mdm Ng did not pursue it further with the accused.

12     Heather voiced her concern to Karl that it was not prudent for the boxes to be shipped back to the accused without being aware of the contents as they would have to declare the contents of what was being shipped. They went over to the house the next day on 29 October 2016 to check on the contents of the boxes. When the boxes were opened, they discovered many items belonging to them and a video was recorded of the items they had taken out.

13     Mr Liew returned to Singapore and was informed at the Sunday family lunch on 30 October 2016 about the accused’s termination and the subsequent discovery of items in the boxes. Mr Liew decided that a police report should be lodged and Karl accompanied him to lodge the report.

14     On 2 December 2016, the accused decided to return to Singapore and was arrested upon arrival. Her bags were found to contain more items belonging to the victims. These items included:

a.     The two Longchamp bags;

b.     One Gerald Genta watch;

c.     One Helix watch;

d.     Two white iPhones with accessories;

e.     One black Braun Buffel wallet;

f.     One black Gucci wallet;

g.     One Prada bag;

h.     One Gucci sunglasses with red stains.

## The Defence’s Case

15     The accused denies that any of the items listed in the four charges had been stolen. The accused’s various defences are:

a.     Some of the items were purchased by her;

b.     Some of the items were given to her;

c.     Some of the items were discarded and found by her;

d.     Remaining items were not packed by her in the boxes.

16     Further, the accused alleges that the Liew family had conspired to bring the false allegations against her in order to prevent her from returning to Singapore to file a complaint with the MOM because she had been deployed to do work outside of the Liew family home.

## Credibility of the Witnesses

17     I found the prosecution witnesses to be largely credible, and found their evidence to be clear, compelling and consistent even under lengthy cross-examination by defence counsel. Whilst they may have had slightly different recollection on the details of what had happened or the items, I did not find any reason to disbelieve their testimonies. As for the victims, they were able to identify the items that belonged to them and provide details as to how they came into their possession, the estimated amount they purchased them for, and whether they had ever discarded or given away the items.

18     The defence called Eric Ong as an expert witness to testify on the value of the Gerald Genta watch. His evidence was not always objective and there were occasions when he turned defensive when questioned on the basis of his valuation or was shown to have contradicted himself.

19     Diah was called as a factual witness, and I found her answers were generally consistent though there were some minor details in her evidence which differed from that of the accused, such as when she had given the wallets to the accused.

20     Teo Eng Lian from Jarmay Enterprises was also called as a defence witness to give evidence on a black knife, one of the item in the assortment of the kitchenware and utensils and I found her answers to be candid and forthright.

21     In respect of the accused, Prosecution proceeded to impeach her credibility based on the inconsistencies in her statements and I found material inconsistencies between her evidence in court and her statements. She had various versions when giving evidence on various items such as the Pioneer DVD player, the Vacheron Constantin watch, white Swatch watch or and purple Prada bag depending on whether it was in her statement, examination-in-chief or cross-examination.[^8]

## My findings in respect of the proceeded charges

## Items in the possession of Liew Mun Leong

#### P19 - Pioneer DVD Player

22     Mr Liew testified that this was purchased during the renovation of the house and it was placed in Karl’s room and it had never been given away.[^9] Mdm Ng also confirmed that she had never given the DVD player to the accused and that it did not break down.[^10] This is in contrast to the accused’s evidence that Mdm Ng wanted to throw the player away and the accused told her she wanted to take it back to Indonesia to repair. The defence further accused prosecution of using a “sleight-of-hand” technique to demonstrate in court that the DVD player was working.

23     The defence counsel attempt to introduce evidence from bar by persisting in giving a lengthy explanation of how the DVD player could not be played. Such evidence should have at the very least been elicited from the accused herself in examination-in-chief or re-examination if the accused wanted to clarify or retract her concession that the DVD player was working. Alternatively, the accused could have introduced the same through an expert, as was done in the case of the Gerald Genta watch. In any event, the crux of the issue was whether the DVD player had been taken without permission and I was of the view that it had been, because the accused admitted the same in her statement[^11].

#### P2 & P3 – Brown and Blue Longchamp bag

24     Mr Liew testified that he purchased several foldable Longchamp bags from overseas for travel and would not discard them as they were durable. He found that a number of these bags went missing.[^12] The accused’s version is that these Longchamp bags were found by her in an abandoned suitcase[^13], or large black suitcase, or big bag[^14] outside one of the houses at Chancery Lane five or six years ago. Whilst a Longchamp bag is a common bag that is available in Singapore, I did not accept that the accused was able to chance across two Longchamp bags of the same style as that used by Mr Liew that had been discarded by his neighbours. I preferred the evidence of Mr Liew in this regard.

## Items in the possession of Karl Liew

## Reasons for Amendment of DAC-931428-2017

25     After considering the evidence and submissions by prosecution and defence, I was of the view that the charge DAC-931428-2017 should be altered. I exercised my discretion under section 128 of the CPC to alter this charge on 20 March 2019, before verdict was due to be given and set out my reasons for the amendment.

#### Items of Clothing

26     I found that there was reasonable doubt whether all 120 items of clothing belonged to or was in Karl’s possession. Whilst I did not fully accept the accused’s evidence that some of the clothes identified were hers, I found that there was sufficient reasonable doubt that some items were Karl’s because of his inability to recall if some items had ever been in his possession, and/or whether he had worn them. Some of the items were smaller-sized female clothing as well which raised sufficient reasonable doubt whether these were truly Karl’s items. The items which I found did not belong to Karl were:

a.     Item 10/120 in P1A-5 – blue corduroy shirt

b.     Item 25/120 in P1A-6 – cream polo tee shirt

c.     Item 66/120 in P1A-8 – red blouse

d.     Item 101/120 in P1A-10 – black dress

27     For Item 29/120, I found that this belonged to Karl, however, as the item was in fact a quilt cover, it could not be classified as an “item of clothing”. With the removal of the five items, the charge was amended to state 115 items of clothing instead of 120 items of clothing.

#### Two black wallets

28     Of the two black wallets listed in the charge, one Gucci[^15] and one Braun Buffel wallet[^16], I found that Karl was not able to recall much about the items apart from saying that all his wallets were gifts from his family.[^17] There was no evidence that Karl had used these wallets either as he was unfamiliar with the wallets or the condition that they were in.

29     The accused’s evidence is that her friend Diah had given her these two second-hand wallets and the accused pointed out the wear and tear on the wallets. I note that the accused in her statement to the police only mentioned that the Braun Buffel wallet had been given to her by Diah[^18]. The accused was unable to specify how she came into possession of the Gucci wallet. It was only in examination in chief that the accused claimed that the Gucci wallet was also gifted to her by Diah.[^19] Having considered the evidence, there is some doubt raised whether these two wallets belonged to Karl. This is because none of the Liew family members who testified had recognised gifting Karl these wallets. More importantly, the style of these wallets did not appear to be men’s wallets and therefore I found that it was likely that Karl was mistaken about these two wallets having been gifted to him. I therefore amended the charge to remove the description of the two wallet items.

30     The value of the Gerald Genta watch was overestimated at $25,000 in the charge. Prosecution has invited the court to amend the value to $10,000.[^20] I agreed that the evidence showed the value of the watch to be closer to $10,000 and I therefore amended the value of the Gerald Genta watch to $10,000.

31     The amended charge below was read to the accused and her plea was taken:

_You, are charged that you, on 28 October 2016 at about 1 pm, at 49 Chancery Lane, Singapore, a building used as a human dwelling, did commit theft of the following items:_

1)     _115 pieces of clothing valued at S$150 each;_

2)     _One blanket valued at S$500;_

3)     _Three bedsheets valued at S$100 each;_

4)     _One Philips DVD player valued at S$150;_

5)     _An assortment of kitchenware and utensils valued at S$300;_

6)     _One "Helix" watch valued at S$50;_

7)     _One damaged "Gerald Genta" watch valued at S$10,000; and_

8)     _Two white iPhone 4 with accessories valued at S$2,056_

_with a total value of S$30,606, in the possession of one Liew Kai Lung Karl, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008)._

32     The accused maintained her plea of not guilty. Prosecution did not apply to recall any witnesses. Counsel for the defence applied to recall five witnesses with reference to the altered charge. The five witnesses they wished to recall were: Karl, the investigation officer Tang Ru Long, the photographer, the accused, and the maker of a statement.[^21] Counsel wanted to “refocus the defence” and “go through in excruciating detail” all the remaining items of clothing as well as “establish a new form that the Defence will have to take”.[^22]

33     I did not accede to defence counsel’s application to recall the witnesses as I was of the view that this was merely an attempt to further delay the trial or to frustrate justice. I emphasise that the amendment of the charge was merely to _remove_ the reference to 5 items of clothing and two wallets that the accused was alleged to have stolen from Karl. The value of the items was also amended to bring the total value down to just $30,606.

34     Karl was already on the stand for 5 days and defence counsel had already cross-examined him on all the items in “excruciating detail” to the extent of asking for numerous pieces of clothing to be physically exhibited in court not just to Karl but to the other prosecution witnesses. In spite of this, Karl had explained his basis of why he believed that the items were his or claimed the items to be his. I did not see any reason why Karl’s evidence or the accused evidence would be any different with the removal of the 7 items from the charge, or why the defence would suddenly take on a new form simply because I found that some items may not have belonged to Karl and removed them from the charge. My findings on the items listed in the amended charge are set out below.

#### P24 – 115 items of clothing

35     With respect to the clothing, a number of these were shirts that Mr Liew had passed to Karl. Karl confirmed that he had never given the accused any clothes. Mdm Ng only gave the accused clothes that were hers, and not anyone else’s.[^23] Heather had also identified two items as belonging to her which were kept in their wardrobe.[^24]

36     The accused claimed that some of the shirts had been given by May’s husband, Robin and Mdm Ng whilst the other clothing were purchased by her. She also denied that she had wanted to pack Karl’s clothes into the boxes, saying that these had been packed into the boxes by Robin and Ismail.

37     Without delving into the details of each and every item of clothing, I note that Robin and Mdm Ng denied giving the accused clothes. In fact, Robin denied even owning the shirt the accused alleged he had given her.[^25] The accused admitted that she had taken 10 to 15 men’s clothing in her statement[^26] without permission though she claimed in court subsequently that prior permission had been given.

38     As for the allegation that Karl’s clothes had been packed into the box by Robin and Ismail, this did not gel with the accused’s explanation in her statement[^27] where she said that _after_ the luggage and three boxes had been sealed and whilst waiting for the agent to arrive, she brought out the clothes that Karl had given to his previous maid, and Karl had started to try on two items of clothes before her agent arrived. If the boxes had already been sealed, and she had brought the clothes out to return to Karl, then I see no reason how those clothes could have been ended up inside the sealed boxes.

39     Furthermore, whilst it may be possible to accuse Robin or Ismail of inadvertently putting in a few shirts into the boxes, the sheer quantity of the shirts found in the boxes makes the accused’s version doubtful. 115 items of clothing take up considerable space in the jumbo boxes. If these shirts had been inadvertently packed in, the accused would not have had sufficient space for her other items. Conversely, the fact that all her items could fit into the boxes meant that the accused had provisioned for the space needed for these shirts when requesting for the three jumbo boxes to be purchased.

#### P22, P23 – Blanket and three bedsheets

40     Karl gave clear evidence that he had bought the item at P22 which is a duvet cover from the UK costing $500 which was a “big thing” for a student in the UK but which he justified on the basis that he would be there for three years. He also bought the bedcover at P1-11 from Habitat and remembered the design as it was his favourite.[^28]

41     The accused relies on the label of the bedcover at P1-11 to say she purchased it from Ikea for $49 whilst the duvet cover was given by May. She also claimed that May had given her the brown blanket and blue bedsheet. In contrast, not only did May deny giving the items in P1-11 and P1-12, she was clear that she had not even seen these before.[^29] Whether Karl had bought the bed cover from Habitat or elsewhere, I found no reason to doubt that he had purchased it from the UK. On the other hand, the accused’s version that May had given the items to her was directly contradicted by May herself.

#### P20 – Philips DVD player

42     Karl identified the Philips DVD player as his and Heather confirmed that it was purchased and used when they were both based in China. The accused claims that the DVD player had been given to her by Mdm Ng after she requested for a television and DVD player in her room and the DVD player was used every day. However, she claimed she had left the DVD player under the network box on the day of her termination. Again, the accused’s version is directly contradicted by Mdm Ng who said she did not give the accused the DVD player and who denied that there was even a television in the accused’s room. I did not accept the accused’s version. If the DVD player had been left under the network box, there was no reason for the DVD player to end up being packed into the jumbo boxes. I further note that there was no mention of DVDs being found in her possession or in the jumbo boxes, which might have supported her claim that she used the DVD player daily.

#### P21 – An assortment of kitchenware and utensils

43     Karl identified the kitchenware and utensils as his items from his student days, some of which were purchased overseas and others in Singapore. Heather and Karl gave evidence that they had used the stainless steel pot whenever they went to buy prata in order to get more curry.

44     The accused claimed that the utensils were purchased from a second-hand store Hock Siong, and the ceramic pot was purchased from NTUC using cash and points. Mdm Ng however testified that the accused had told her that the items were given by the accused’s friend. I found the version by Karl and Heather to be consistent and compelling. I did not think that the accused would allow the Liew family to use kitchenware that she had bought personally or obtained from her friend. No reason was proffered either as to why the accused required not one set but six sets of utensils. There was also no evidence led as to why the accused would have needed to purchase chopsticks. Did she ordinarily use chopsticks to eat during meal times?

45     I note that many items were purportedly purchased from the second-hand shop Hock Siong, yet no representative from Hock Siong was called by the defence to confirm if the accused was indeed a frequent visitor of the shop, or if the shop indeed sold such a wide range of second-hand items, from bedlinen to kitchenware to even perhaps thermal wear. Instead, the accused only chose to call Ms Teo to testify whether the particular make of knife was sold prior to 2006 to rebut Karl’s claim that he had the knife in the UK. Ms Teo however, conceded that she may have remembered wrongly as to whether the knife was only sold after 2006.

#### P6 –Helix watch

46     Karl testified that Mr Liew had given him this watch which he found to be ugly but did not realise that the watch had gone missing.

47     The accused claims that this was found in Karl’s rubbish bin when he was moving out of the house in 2009 for renovations. This was contradicted by Karl as he testified that he was not involved in the packing at that time because he had been hospitalised following a car accident. It was implausible for Karl to have been packing, sorting or throwing things out if he was hospitalised. Instead, it was more likely than not that Karl’s absence was the opportune time for the accused to have taken his items and any items discovered missing would simply be brushed off as being misplaced during the move.

#### P7 – Gerald Genta watch

48     This was given to Karl by Mr Liew. It was an item that Mdm Ng had won as first prize in a lucky draw that Mr Liew and Mdm Ng had attended and was of sentimental value to Karl. Karl did not throw away the watch but realised it was missing when he was unable to find it.

49     The accused claimed in examination in chief that the watch was from the black trash bag left behind in the house during Karl’s move to their new place on 1 March 2016. Under cross-examination, she said these trash bags were placed outside the house on 1 March 2016, and she inspected the bags on 2 March 2016, the day after the move. She claimed that the watch was not working as the hands did not move and the strap was broken with a knob missing.

50     The watch had an automatic movement and whilst it may have had a broken strap or a missing knob, its hands would still be able to move unless further damage was caused to the watch whilst it was in the accused’s possession. There was no reason for Karl to discard such an expensive watch and thus I preferred Karl’s version over that of the accused.

#### P8 – Two iPhones with accessories

51     Karl’s testimony was clear that he would not discard mobile phones as they were handy as spare phones when travelling. Similarly, Heather said their old phones would be left in the room as they were used as hard drives to keep photographs. In contrast, the accused claimed that the phones were found in the rubbish bag during Karl’s moving out in March 2016. Further, Heather had testified that the accused had asked her for the phones before but Heather refused to sell the iPhones. I did not accept the accused’s version of events. It was simply not conceivable that Karl and Heather would refuse to sell the iPhones to the accused, but yet discard the iPhones with SIM cards still intact.

## Items in the possession of May Liew

#### P12 – Vacheron Constantin watch

#### P13 – White Swatch watch

#### P14, P15, P17 – Assorted jewellery and fashion accessories

52     May’s evidence was that she purchased the Vacheron Constantin watch in Shanghai in the early 2000s, whilst the Swatch was last seen by her in 2004. May never discarded the watches nor gave them to the accused. She only discovered that these were in the accused’s possession when she was called to the police station to identify the items.

53     The accused’s version is that May had discarded the Vacheron Constantin watch in 2011 or 2012 after sorting items from the storage facility. Yet in cross-examination, the accused said that the watch was picked up from May’s dustbin. Similarly, the accused found the Swatch watch in May’s trash and assumed she could take it.

54     Without delving into the details of the jewellery and fashion accessories, May was able to identify the items as hers, and circumstances of how and why she purchased them. The accused’s broad defence was that these were picked from May’s rubbish bin in 2011 or 2012 and she did not seek permission if she could take them. For two items, the accused claimed that she had purchased them from Taka jewellery and from Lucky Plaza.

55     I preferred the version of May as she was able to recount details on how she obtained the watches and accessories. Moreover, May came across as honest and forthright, and did not appear to be someone who would claim ownership over items that she was not completely sure were hers. Just because May had moved out of the house did not mean that the accused had carte blanche to help herself to May’s watches, jewellery or fashion accessories left in the house.

#### P18 – One black Gucci sunglass

56     May was able to identify this item as hers because of its particular shape and she last saw the item in a drawer in her bedroom in 2004. The item was not discarded by her and was not given to anyone else.

57     The accused’s version is that this sunglass was in her room when she started working for the Liew family in 2007 and she had kept it in her cupboard. The sunglass was inadvertently packed in her luggage because she had been in a rush. Even if I accepted the accused’s version that the sunglass was in her room when she first started working, the sunglass had been kept in her cupboard all the time, and it did not seem plausible that the accused could unintentionally pack the item in. It was not in dispute that the accused had personally packed her luggage, thus she had full intention of taking the item back to Indonesia.

## Items in the possession of Heather Lim

#### P9 – Purple Prada Bag

#### P10 – One black Gucci sunglass with red stains

58     Heather testified that she bought the bag more than 10 years ago and used it for stayovers or as a gym bag. She did not discard the bag because it was a Prada and was working well.[^30] As for the sunglass, she was able to explain how it became stained because she had put it into her bag without putting the glasses in a protective case. She also did not discard the glasses.

59     The accused’s version is that these two items were found in the rubbish bag within the house or outside the house. I accepted Heather’s version that these items were never discarded. Instead, it is telling that the accused conveniently relied on the fact that Karl and Heather were in the midst of moving out (whether for renovations or to their own place), to claim that no less than six of these items had been discarded by them and she had taken them thinking that Karl and Heather had relinquished ownership of them.

60     There was no reason why the Liew family and the driver Robin would conspire to frame the accused for the theft, especially when they had employed her for a number of years. They had in fact compensated her for the termination and Karl was even willing to pay for the shipping of her items back to Indonesia. On the contrary, the modus operandi of the accused was to take a variety of items from different family members thinking that these would go unnoticed by them. Despite having returned to Indonesia for more than a month, the accused never showed interest in finding out why she had not received the 3 jumbo boxes yet if those items in the boxes were truly hers. Her purpose of returning to Singapore was not to follow up on the jumbo boxes, but to find new employment as evidenced by her statement to the police.

61     I therefore found that the prosecution had proven the four charges beyond reasonable doubt and find the accused guilty and convicted on all four charges.

## Sentencing

62     In respect of the remaining charge which was stood down at the start of trial, prosecution had offered for the remaining charge to be taken into consideration in sentencing, however the accused did not consent to the same as she maintained her innocence.[^31]

63     This offence of theft as a servant under section 381 of the Penal Code and theft in dwelling under section 380 are both punishable with imprisonment of up to 7 years and a fine may be imposed in addition to the term of imprisonment.

64     The prosecution sought a global imprisonment term of at least 3 years, with a sentence of 6 to 8 months for the 1st, 3rd and 4th charge and 28 to 30 months for the 2nd charge, and with 2 of the sentences to run consecutively. The defence is seeking a global sentence of 10 weeks’ imprisonment.

65     As highlighted in the case of _Umaroh v PP_ , “it is in the public interest that employees such as domestic maids who have ready, easy and constant access to the employer’s property be deterred from stealing from them through the imposition of appropriate punishment.”

## Sentencing Considerations

66     General deterrence is the key sentencing principle here, and in the context of domestic workers, there must be an equally strong deterrent against theft of items belonging not just to the employer on record, but also his family members whose items are also in the house.

67     Whilst the accused was a first-time offender and it was not disputed that the items in the charges had been recovered, there were aggravating factors in this case such as the sheer number of items stolen, the high value of some of the items, premeditation and the prolonged period over which the thefts took place.

68     The quantity and variety of stolen items showed that the accused took these items out of greed, and not need, and certainly not because she was into recycling or “up-cycling” as the defence has called it. In particular, the accused took things which she may have thought were old, spoilt or forgotten, but which she had no immediate need for. The accused even brazenly committed the theft right under the family’s nose by getting Karl to pay for the shipping of the three boxes.

## Conduct of defence

69     I considered the manner in which the accused had conducted her defence in this trial. _Christine Lewis v PP_ states that: “Where accused persons are free to prove their innocence, it must be made clear that this does not translate to a liberty to blatantly besmirch the repute of prosecution witnesses behind the shield of privilege in judicial proceedings.”

70     The accused was charged in court on 31 August 2017. Prior to the commencement of this trial in April 2018, the Liew family and the driver Robin gave evidence that they had been contacted on various occasions by the accused’s representatives. Examples include:

a.     Heather, one of the victims, was contacted by a paralegal from the defence counsel’s firm to attend an interview;

b.     Mdm Ng was contacted a few times by the accused’s representative to go out and talk about the case. Whilst Mdm Ng could not hear clearly because of background noise, she testified that she had told him she could not help and she heard the response as – she would be in trouble if she did not go out;

c.     Robin received missed calls and a message from defence counsel to return his call and to tell him “there is no reason to be afraid”, as well as a call from the HOME organization representative, requesting that he come out to talk; and

d.     the accused also attended a civil hearing where Karl, a victim, was testifying. The accused looked at him and giggled, which he perceived to be a message of intimidation;

71     In the case of the witness for the defence, when Teo Lian Eng (“Ms Teo”) of Jarmay Enterprises, a distributor of kitchen knives, failed to attend court to give evidence, defence counsel applied for a warrant for her arrest. Ms Teo subsequently testified that she had not agreed to be a witness for the defence. She however received various legal letters from the defence counsel which Ms Teo described as harassing and which made her feel stressed, and therefore she turned up to testify for the defence. Ms Teo told the defence counsel that she had felt stressed because “you say that you will catch me” and that the court “want to arrest me”. However, there was no warrant of arrest issued by the court.

72     The manner in which the defence attempted to have Stephanie Chok (“Stephanie”) from HOME to be called as a witness. When a section 231 CPC notice was given on the intention to call Stephanie as a witness, counsel for the defence refused to disclose the area of evidence she would be testifying on in his section 231 notice. Shortly before she was due to testify, defence counsel disclosed that she was to be called to give expert evidence on false allegations of theft by employers against domestic workers. I disallowed her to be called as an expert as I was of the view that her area of expertise would not be of relevance or assistance in this trial. Counsel for the defence then said that Stephanie would be called to give factual evidence of the accused’s employment history. I did not think that a witness could interchangeably be either an expert or a factual witness. In any event, as prosecution did not object to the document showing the accused’s employment history, I did not see any reason for Stephanie to be called to give factual evidence based on that same document.

73     The manner in which the defence conducted cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and the number of irrelevant issues raised during trial which was unrelated to the subject matter of the four charges also showed a complete lack of remorse on the part of the accused. Instead the manner in which the cross-examination by defence was conducted was focused on causing as much embarrassment to the prosecution witnesses as possible under the guise of wanting to establish the witnesses’ credibility. Counsel for the defence even attempted to introduce evidence from the bar instead of eliciting the same from the accused herself whilst alleging misconduct against the prosecution and the investigators

74     Counsel for the defence accused Karl of being a habitual liar, accused Mr Liew of trumping up the charges against the accused, when Mr Liew had unequivocally stated that there was no motivation for a person like him to go against a maid and that his purpose in making a police report was to protect other families in Singapore from becoming victims of the accused.

## The Sentence Imposed

75     For the 1st, 3rd and 4th charges, I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions on sentence and I imposed a sentence of 6 months for each of the charge. This was an appropriate sentence after considering similar precedents such as _PP v Sumugae Mery Grace Anday_ (unreported) where the offender was also a domestic worker who had stolen items to ship home. The accused was sentenced to 14 weeks’ imprisonment after pleading guilty to a charge under section 381 read with section 34 of the Penal Code. Here, the accused had claimed trial and the conduct of her defence at trial meant that an uplift from the 14 weeks’ imprisonment would be appropriate. In _PP v Siti Nuryati_ (unreported), a maid who pleaded guilty to an offence under section 381 of the Penal Code for stealing a $1800 diamond ring was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.

76     For the 2nd charge where the total value of the items taken from Karl amounted to more than $30,000, I agreed that the sentence imposed should be higher than the rest of the charges based on the sheer quantity of the items and value of the items. However, I was of the view that the range of 28 to 30 months’ imprisonment as submitted by prosecution was too high. The cited precedent of _PP v Dinh Ngoc Luan & Ors_ (unreported) was a case of shoplifting which would have involved new items, and even then, the highest individual sentence meted out in the case was 20 months’ imprisonment. I was of the view that even after calibrating for the value of the items stolen in the 2nd charge, albeit that some items may have been old, second-hand or damaged, a sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the accused’s case here.

77     Where there are 3 or more sentences, at least 2 of the sentences must run consecutively. I have also considered the one transaction rule and totality principle. The accused’s offences were not committed in one transaction. They were committed at different times and the subject matter of the thefts were different. I am satisfied that it will not be a crushing sentence if the sentences for the 1st charge and the 2nd charge were to run consecutively, giving a total of 26 months’ imprisonment. A summary of the respective sentencing position taken by prosecution and defence and the sentence imposed by the court on each of the four charges is set out below.
