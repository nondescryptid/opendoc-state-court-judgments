### District Judge Lim Tse Haw:

## Introduction

1       The Accused, Vu Han Jean-Luc Kha (male of 44 years of age), a French national (“the Accused”), pleaded guilty before me to the following two charges:

> 1st charge\-

> For using the following insulting words, “_do you have hair on your balls?”, “do you want to see mine?”, “I can arrange a blowjob arrangement for you,”, “fuck”, “motherfucker”, “little bitch” and “you have no hair on your balls why do you want to challenge me?”_ towards the victim, a 13-year-old boy (“the Victim”) with intent to cause alarm to the Victim, an offence under section 3(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A) and punishable under section 3(2) of the said Act (“the POHA charge”); and

> 2nd charge\-

> For voluntarily causing hurt to the Victim, by punching him on the left temple and slapping him on the left cheek, an offence under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224)(“the causing hurt charge”).

2       On behalf of the Accused, defence counsel Ms Teh Ee-von (“Ms Teh”) tendered, as part of the Accused’s plea in mitigation, medical reports from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) which diagnosed the Accused to be suffering from bipolar disorder, a mental disorder, at the material time of the offences. She then urged me to call for a suitability report for a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) on the Accused in order to assess the Accused’s suitability for an MTO.

3       Having considered the Accused’s IMH reports, the plea in mitigation and the parties’ submissions on sentence, I decided to call for an MTO suitability report on the Accused, despite objection from the prosecution.

4       By way of a detailed MTO suitability report dated 25 March 2002, the appointed psychiatrist, Dr Pamela Ng from the IMH (“Dr Pamela Ng”) opined that there was a contributory link between the Accused’s bipolar disorder and the commission of the offences. She was also of the view that the Accused was suitable for treatment for his mental disorder and recommended that the Accused be placed on an MTO for a period of 12 months.

5       Having considered all relevant sentencing considerations, I sentenced the Accused to undergo 12 months’ of MTO.

6       Being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed, the prosecution has appealed against the same.

## Statement of Facts

7       The Accused admitted to the following statement of facts[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) without any qualification:

8       On 22 November 2019 at about 8.15 pm, the Victim and his 12-year-old brother (“the Brother”) were in their father’s office at level 10 of Parklane Shopping Mall at 35 Selegie Road, Singapore (“the Mall”) when they decided to head downstairs to the McDonald’s fast food restaurant for dinner. The Victim and the Brother entered lift number 2 from the tenth storey of the Mall. At that time, the lift was empty.

## Facts relating to the charges

9       When the lift stopped at the fifth storey, the Accused and his friend, one Lai Wing Chiew (“Lai”) entered the lift. Prior to this, the Accused had been drinking and was intoxicated. Upon entering the lift, the Accused asked the Victim “_do you have hair on your balls_?” and the Victim said no. The Accused then asked the Victim “_do you want to see mine?_” and the Victim said no again. The Accused then said “_I can arrange a blowjob arrangement for you_”. The Victim was alarmed by the insults and responded by saying no.

10     For no apparent reason, the Accused punched the Victim on the left temple with the intent to cause hurt, causing the Victim to fall backwards and slam his left upper arm into the elevator’s handrails. The Accused then hurled vulgarities, such as “_fuck”, “motherfucker”, “little bitch_” towards the Victim. The insulting words caused alarm to the Victim. Fearing for his safety, the Victim grabbed the Accused’s hands to prevent the Accused from hitting him again. The Accused then said, “you want to challenge me? _You have no hair on your balls why do you want to challenge me?_” Meanwhile, Lai was holding the Accused back.

11     The lift then stopped at the first storey and Lai pushed the Accused out of the lift. However, the Accused refused to leave and used his foot to stop the lift doors from closing. While the lift doors were open, the Accused slapped the Victim on his left cheek, with the intention to cause hurt and pushed the Victim. This was seen by a witness, who was sitting at a café on the first storey of the Mall. The witness then went forward and asked the Victim about what had happened. He then detained the Accused and Lai at the main entrance of the Mall and called the police.

### Injuries Suffered by the Victim

12     The Victim was seen by Dr. Bobby Tan on 22 November 2019 at 11.40pm at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Children’s Emergency. As a result of the attack, the Victim suffered the following injuries:

> (a).     2cm by 2cm bruise over left temple; and

> (b).     3cm by 3cm erythema (redness of the skin) over left upper arm.

## Antecedent

13     The Accused is a first time offender.

## Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

14     The prosecution submitted for a global imprisonment term of at least eight weeks’ and a fine to be imposed on the Accused.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

15     For the causing hurt charge, the prosecution submitted that the present case falls within the lower end of Band 2 of the following sentencing framework as set out in _Low Song Chye v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”) and hence an imprisonment term of at least eight weeks would be appropriate:

16     The prosecution placed the present case in the lower end of Band 2 for the following reasons:

> (i)     the physical harm caused was relatively minor (2cm by 2cm bruise over left temple and 3cm by 3cm erythema over left upper arm); and

> (ii)     there was significant psychological harm caused to the Victim: the prosecution tendered a victim impact statement (“VIS”) dated 17 November 2020 (about one year after the incident) wherein the Victim stated that he was still fearful of taking lifts, experienced flashbacks of the incident and was unable to sleep well.**[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)**

17     The prosecution submitted that hurt can extend to non-physical injuries such as psychological harm and this was a relevant and crucial sentencing consideration. The prosecution therefore submitted that the indicative starting point should be at least six weeks’ imprisonment.

18     On the second step of making the necessary adjustments to the indicative starting point sentence based on the assessment of the Accused’s culpability, as well as all other relevant factors, the prosecution submitted for an uplift of two weeks’ imprisonment, taking into account the following factors:

> (i)     The Accused had punched the Victim in the head, a vulnerable region of the body;

> (ii)     The Accused was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the offence;

> (iii)     The Accused’s intoxication had caused the Victim to experience an increased state of terror, which is further aggravating, as the Victim was so terrified that he had grabbed the Accused’s hands, just in case the Accused hit him again;

> (iv)     The assault was entirely unprovoked;

> (v)     The episode was not brief, as the Accused had verbally abused and punched the Victim in the lift. Even after the lift doors were open, the Accused refused to leave and slapped the Victim on the left cheek;

> (vi)     The Victim was a vulnerable victim – he was only 13 years old at the material time;

> (vii)     The attack took place in front of the Victim’s younger brother, who was only 12 years old at the material time.

19     For the POHA charge, the prosecution, notwithstanding having submitted for a global imprisonment term of at least eight weeks’ _and a fine_ to be imposed on the Accused in paragraph 2 of its submission, eventually did not submit for any particular sentence for this charge, but highlighted instead the Accused’s state of voluntary intoxication and the Victim being a vulnerable victim due to his age as aggravating factors.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4)

## Mitigation and Defence’s Submissions on Sentence[^5]

20     The Accused was working as a chief executive officer (“CEO”) of a restaurant chain in Singapore at the material time of the offences. He was a single father to a 14-year-old daughter.

21     In the months leading up to the offences on 22 November 2019, the Accused had been facing a series of “unique circumstances” in his professional and personal life, such as, _inter alia__[\[note: 6\]](#Ftn_6)_:

> (a)     his separation from his common law wife of 20 years and having to adjust to single parenting;

> (b)     the health of his ex-partner who suffered from frequent seizures;

> (c)     undergoing a rough patch with his current partner;

> (d)     financial pressure from his business; and

> (e)     personal pressure to support his ex-partner and his current home with his daughter.

22     As a result, he experienced uncharacteristic changes in the way his body functioned, such as sleep deprivation, abnormal increased irritability and activities, decreased impulse controls, ‘racing thoughts’, errors of judgment, erratic and emotional outbursts, among other abnormal behaviours.[\[note: 7\]](#Ftn_7)

23     On the day of the offences, the Accused had been worried and irritable when, in addition to the above stress factors, he found out that the profit and loss statement of his company showed poor results.

24     In the evening, he had gone to a KTV lounge at Sophia Road where he met with friends and they had a few drinks. Later he went to another KTV lounge at the Mall with another friend, Lai. They were there from 6.45pm to about 8.00 pm when they decided to have a quick dinner at a café located at the fifth storey before heading back to his workplace.

25     After dinner, the pair then took the lift down to the ground level to the taxi stand. The Victim and the Brother were already in the lift when it stopped at the fifth floor. The Accused did not notice the age or profile of the Victim and the Brother. Although initially claiming that he remembered vaguely that the Victim had said something “irksome” to him (although he was not able to recall what the Victim had said), the Accused eventually conceded that whatever “irksome” thing that the Victim had allegedly said to him was entirely self-perceived by him and did not come from the Victim.[\[note: 8\]](#Ftn_8) The Accused became agitated and committed the offences.[^9]

26     The offences precipitated a reflection on his own behaviour by the Accused. In November 2020, he decided to see a psychiatrist about it. He was recommended therapy but in spite of seeing a therapist for a few months, the Accused did not get better and still felt poorly. He then realized that he may have a more severe problem. So he voluntarily made an appointment with the IMH to get a second opinion on his condition.[\[note: 10\]](#Ftn_10)

### Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder

27     Consequently, the Accused was diagnosed to be suffering from bipolar disorder by Dr Joseph Leong, a senior consultant at IMH, on 26 February 2021. Since then, he has been seeking treatment for his disorder with Dr Leong.[\[note: 11\]](#Ftn_11)

#### IMH Reports by Dr Pamela Ng

28     As a result, Ms Teh applied for a specialist medical report from IMH. In a medical report dated 2 June 2021[\[note: 12\]](#Ftn_12), Dr Pamela Ng, a consultant psychiatrist with the IMH, gave the following opinions, _inter alia_:

> (a)     The Accused has bipolar disorder, which is a treatable mental illness;

> (b)     It was likely that the Accused was having an episode of mania at the time of the offences;

> (c)     His alcohol consumption on that day might have also caused him to be more impulsive and harder to control his emotions, when provoked, when he was already in an irritable mood, leading to the offences;

> (d)     If his mental illness is treated and he remains abstinent from alcohol, the likelihood that he will reoffend is low.

29     In a further report dated 29 September 2021[\[note: 13\]](#Ftn_13) requested by the defence, Dr Pamela Ng elaborated on the effects that an episode of mania would have on a patient as follows:

> (a)     A person who has an episode of mania presents with abnormally and persistently elevated or irritable mood and increased activity or energy. Other symptoms include inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, pressure to keep talking, racing thoughts, distractibility and excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for serious consequences. When the Accused had an episode of mania, his mood was abnormally elevated and he was easily irritated. He had increased energy and distractibility, grandiosity (thinking he was the best CEO in Singapore), reduced need for sleep, racing thoughts, fast speech that no one could understand, hypersexuality and reckless spending;

> (b)     During an episode of mania, the Accused had impaired judgment and made rash decisions;

> (c)     Psychosis can occur during an episode of mania;

> (d)     The Accused could be more impulsive and it would be harder for him to control his emotions due to mania on its own (without the influence of alcohol);

> (e)     His manic episodes were not caused by his alcohol consumption.

30     Having perused the two reports above by Dr Pamela Ng, I noted that Dr Pamela Ng did not state whether the Accused’s bipolar disorder had any contributory link to the commission of the offences, and if so, in what way. Hence, I directed Ms Teh to seek clarification from Dr Pamela Ng on this. In a clarification report dated 2 November 2021, Dr Pamela Ng clarified as follows:

> (a)     That the Accused’s mania had contributed to the commission of the offence; and

> (b)     When the Accused was having a manic episode, he was more easily irritated and it was harder for him to control his emotions. He also had a tendency to make reckless decisions when he was manic. His alcohol consumption on that day could also cause him to be more impulsive when he was already in an irritable mood. _He was provoked when the victim made some remarks about his conversation with his friend, causing him to scold vulgarities and hit the victim._ \[Emphasis in italics added\][\[note: 14\]](#Ftn_14)

31     After the aforesaid reports were prepared, Sundaresh Menon CJ released the judgment in _Wong Tian Jun De Beers v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 273</span> (“_De Beers”_) on 1 December 2021. In the judgment at \[19\], Sundaresh Menon CJ emphasised that expert witnesses owe a duty to the court to ensure that their evidence is reliable and fit for court use. In the circumstances, I directed that the charges and the statement of facts, which the Accused had pleaded guilty and admitted to respectively in the course of his plead guilty proceedings, be furnished to Dr Pamela Ng. I also directed that Dr Pamela Ng be updated with the Accused’s concession, as state in \[25\] above that whatever “irksome” thing that the Victim had allegedly said to him was entirely self-perceived by the Accused and did not come from the Victim.

32     Having been given the above further facts and update, Dr Pamela Ng maintained her opinion that there was a contributory link between the Accused’s bipolar disorder and the commission of the offences. This was because he was having a manic episode at the material time.[\[note: 15\]](#Ftn_15)

33     Based on the above IMH reports by Dr Pamela Ng, Ms Teh urged me to call for an MTO suitability report to assess the Accused’s suitability for an MTO. The prosecution objected to this, on the ground that other sentencing considerations outweighed that of rehabilitation.[\[note: 16\]](#Ftn_16) The prosecution also disputed the fact that the Accused was suffering from bipolar disorder but decided not to subject the Accused to another psychiatric assessment by a different psychiatrist.[^17]

#### Considerations on whether to call for MTO suitability report

34     In _GCX v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1325</span> (“_GCX”_), See Kee Oon J (“See J”) explained at \[39\] that at this stage of the proceedings, the balancing inquiry into the various sentencing principles was necessary because an MTO should be considered, and the calling of an MTO suitability report contemplated, only if the offender possessed sufficient rehabilitative potential. This balancing exercise would only be tentative and provisional in nature at this stage because the court lacked sufficient information at this point to fully appreciate and assess the true rehabilitative potential of the offender.

35     In the present case, Dr Pamela Ng has diagnosed the Accused to be suffering from bipolar disorder at the time of the offences. It was likely that he was having an episode of mania at the material time and that there was a contributory link between his bipolar disorder and the commission of the offences. Dr Pamela Ng added that if the Accused’s mental illness is treated and he remains abstinent from alcohol, the likelihood that he will reoffend is low. Dr Joseph Leong, senior consultant at IMH also opined that the Accused’s bipolar disorder was under very good control after undergoing regular medical treatment.[\[note: 18\]](#Ftn_18) The above, coupled with the fact that the Accused is a first time offender, persuaded me that the Accused possessed sufficient rehabilitative potential and hence I decided to call for an MTO suitability report to be prepared on him.

### MTO Suitability Report

36     Under section 339(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (“CPC”), a court may make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender only if the report submitted by an appointed psychiatrist states that-

> (a)     the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment;

> (b)     the offender is suitable for the treatment; and

> (c)     the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his or her committing the offence

37     Dr Pamela Ng was also the appointed psychiatrist for the Accused’s MTO suitability report under section 339(13) of the CPC. In an MTO suitability report dated 25 March 2022, she stated as follows:

> (a)     the Accused suffers from bipolar disorder, which is a treatable mental illness. It was likely that he had a manic episode with possibly psychosis at the time of the offences[\[note: 19\]](#Ftn_19);

> (b)     he is suitable for treatment as his mood has improved with medication[\[note: 20\]](#Ftn_20). His condition has also improved significantly since he was started on treatment[^21] ; and

> (c)     there was a contributory link between his mental illness and his offending behaviour[\[note: 22\]](#Ftn_22).

38     Dr Pamela was therefore of the opinion that the Accused was a suitable candidate for an MTO for a period of 12 months.[\[note: 23\]](#Ftn_23) In the circumstances, Ms Teh urged me to sentence the Accused to a 12-month MTO.

39     The prosecution, on the other hand, maintained their objection to an MTO to be ordered and submitted that the sentencing principles of general deterrence and retribution should take precedent in the present case. Although the prosecution accepted Dr Pamela Ng’s MTO suitability report, and hence no longer disputing the fact that the Accused was suffering from bipolar disorder at the time of the offences, they nevertheless pointed out the following reasons why MTO should not be imposed:

> (a)     there was no causal link between the Accused’s bipolar disorder and the commission of the offences, but merely a contributory link;

> (b)     there was no impulse disorder suffered by the Accused; and

> (c)     there was voluntary alcohol consumption by the Accused at the time of the offences, hence an aggravating factor.[\[note: 24\]](#Ftn_24)

40     The prosecution maintained that a custodial sentence was called for and repeated their submission for at least an eight-week imprisonment term and a fine to be imposed on the Accused.

## My Decision

### The Purpose of Community-Based Sentence (“CBS”)

41     In explaining the purpose why CBS sentencing options were introduced by Parliament via the amendments to the CPC, See J in _GCX_ at \[31\] quoted the explanations given by the Minister moving the Bill, Mr K Shanmugam, the Minister for Law on the rationale for introducing CBS at the second reading of the CPC Bill 2010 (No 11 of 2010) as follows:

> **Rationale for having new community sentences**

> Our sentencing philosophy is aimed at deterrence, prevention, retribution and rehabilitation. A fair sentencing framework is one that enables the Court to deliver the correct mix of these four objectives on the specific facts of each case.

> CBS gives more flexibility to the courts. Not every offender should be put in prison. CBS targets offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the Courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum: regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions. For such cases, it is appropriate to harness the resources of the community. The offender remains gainfully employed and his family benefits from the focused treatment.

42     See J concluded in _GCX_ at \[32\] that it was apparent from the above comments that CBSs, including MTOs, were introduced to give the courts more tools to respond to the sentencing principle of rehabilitation. It followed from this that an MTO should be ordered where rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing principle on the facts of a particular case.

### The dominant sentencing principle(s) in the present case

43     What should be the dominant sentencing principle(s) in the present case? The prosecution submitted that it should be general deterrence and retribution, for reasons as set out in \[16\] to \[18\] and \[39\] above. Ms Teh, on the other hand, submitted that in view of the Accused’s bipolar disorder, which has a contributory link to the commission of the present offences, rehabilitation should be the dominant sentencing principle in the present case as the Accused has high rehabilitative potential, as he was extremely remorseful for his offences and was following up with his treatment.[\[note: 25\]](#Ftn_25)

44     At the outset, let me say that the offences committed by the Accused in the present case were deplorable, as he had attacked a vulnerable young victim, both physically and verbally, which was totally unprovoked. It was fortuitous that the Victim suffered only a minor bruise and erythema (redness of the skin). I also note the emotional impact that the incident has had on the Victim, in that he was now scared whenever he was alone in the lift with a male adult, and had flashback of the incident during bedtime. Having said that, however, in my view, the present offences were not so heinous as to rule out the rehabilitation of the Accused completely as the dominant sentencing consideration. In _GCX_, the offender assaulted his former wife in the course of a dispute, causing her to suffer multiple injuries, including fractures of her nose and a rib. The offender pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt under section 323 of the Penal Code, with a separate charge for breaching a personal protection order taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The offender was diagnosed by the appointed psychiatrist from IMH to be suffering from an adjustment disorder which had substantially contributed to the commission of his offence in the MTO suitability report. He was found to be suitable for an MTO. See J sentenced him to an MTO for a period of 24 months on appeal, replacing the 12 weeks’ imprisonment term imposed by the district court.

#### Causal link vs contributory link

45     The prosecution had objected to the Accused being given an MTO on the ground, _inter alia_, that there was no causal link between his bipolar disorder and the commission of the offences, but merely a contributory link. See J in _GCX_ at \[77\] cited the Court of Appeal decision in _Lim Ghim Peow v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1287</span> (“_Lim Ghim Peow”_) which stated at \[26\] that the element of general deterrence may be given considerably less weight if the offender was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence, and this was “_particularly so_ if there was a _causal link_ between the disorder and the commission of the offence” \[emphasis in italics added in _GCX_\]. However, See J pointed out at \[78\] in _GCX_ that the comments in _Lim Ghim Peow_ did not go so far as to say that rehabilitation could _only_ be found to be the dominant sentencing principle _if there was a causal link_ between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence. \[emphasis in italics added in _GCX_\]. Instead, whether rehabilitation was the dominant sentencing principle or not would involve finding the “right balance” between the various sentencing considerations: _Lim Ghim Peow_ at \[39\].

46     See J then pointed out in _GCX_ at \[79\] and \[80\] that section 339(3)(c) of the CPC only required the appointed psychiatrist in the MTO suitability report to state whether he was satisfied that the “psychiatric condition of the offender \[was\] one of the _contributing factors_ for his committing the offence”. \[Emphasis in italics added\]. His Honour was not persuaded that a causal link must be shown before an MTO can be ordered, because the legislative scheme in section 339 of the CPC had imposed no such requirement. If Parliament had intended that an MTO could only be ordered if a causal link was found, Parliament could easily have provided for this. Instead, Parliament only required that the appointed psychiatrist be satisfied that the psychiatric condition of the offender was “one of the contributing factors” for the offender having committed the offence. See J then concluded at \[81\] that it was unnecessary for a causal link to be shown between an offender’s psychiatric condition and his commission of the offence before an MTO could be ordered.

47     In the circumstances, based on the facts of the present case, I am of the view that the dominant sentencing principle should be the _rehabilitation_ of the Accused for the following reasons:

> (a)     the elements of general deterrence and retribution should be given less weight in view of the Accused’s bipolar disorder, which has a contributory link to the commission of the offences. This was notwithstanding the fact that there was voluntary consumption of alcohol by the Accused prior to the commission of the offences and that he may not have suffered from an impulse disorder. In any event, Dr Pamela Ng did elaborate in her further report dated 29 September 2021[\[note: 26\]](#Ftn_26) that during an episode of mania, the Accused would have had impaired judgment and made rash decisions. His manic episodes were not caused by his alcohol consumption. He could be more impulsive and it was harder for him to control his emotions due to mania on its own (without the influence of alcohol)[^27];

> (b)     these were his first offences at the age of 42 years, and hence it could be said to be out of character. This was also consistent with the description of the Accused’s character in the many testimonials from the people who know him[\[note: 28\]](#Ftn_28);

> (c) as noted by Dr Pamela Ng in her MTO suitability report, his condition had improved significantly since he was started on treatment for his bipolar disorder;

> (d) he was suitable for treatment for his bipolar disorder and he had expressed his willingness to comply with the conditions of the MTO[\[note: 29\]](#Ftn_29);

> (e) I was also satisfied that the Accused was genuinely remorseful for his offences, and had extended a sincere and heart-felt letter of apology to the Victim through the investigation officer. He had also offered to make compensation for the Victim's injuries but this was declined by the Victim's parents;[\[note: 30\]](#Ftn_30)

> (f) although the present offences were deplorable, they were not so heinous as to rule out the rehabilitation of the Accused completely as the dominant sentencing consideration. As set out in \[44\] above, the injuries suffered by the victim in _GCX_, which included fractures to her nose and a rib, were much more serious than that suffered by the Victim in the present case. The offender in _GCX_ was placed on 24 months’ MTO.

## Conclusion

48     Under section 339(1) of the CPC, if the court is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may make an MTO requiring the offender to undergo psychiatric treatment for a period not exceeding 36 months.

49     The Accused and the present offences were not precluded by section 337(1) and (2) of the CPC to be considered for an MTO.

50     Dr Pamela Ng, the appointed psychiatrist for the purposes of the Accused’s MTO suitability report, found that the Accused was suitable for an MTO and recommended that he be placed on an MTO for a period of 12 months. Having regard to the circumstances of the present case, including the nature of the offences and the character of the Accused as explained above, I made an MTO requiring the Accused to undergo psychiatric treatment for a period not exceeding 12 months as I found it expedient to do so.

51     The execution of the MTO was stayed pending the appeal by the prosecution, on the application by the prosecution.
