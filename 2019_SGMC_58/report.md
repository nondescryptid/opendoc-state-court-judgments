### District Judge Ng Peng Hong:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal by the Prosecution against sentence. The issue here is whether a mandatory treatment order should be ordered. Having considered the circumstances, the character of the Accused and the nature of the offence, I was of the view that it was expedient to do so and I so ordered.

2       The Accused pleaded guilty and was convicted on the following charge:

## Statement of Facts (“SOF”)

3       The Accused admitted to the SOF reproduced below:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1. The victim cum complainant is Seah Siew Chan, a 54-year-old female Singaporean.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2. The accused is Cheong Yoke Lin, Christina, a 63-year-old female Singaporean, holder of NRIC No.: [REDACTED]. She was working as a part-time English teacher, and was the account holder of DBS eMulti-Currency Autosave Plus Account XXX (“the DBS account”), at the material time.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>FIRST INFORMATION REPORT</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3. On 22 September 2017, the complainant lodged a police report at the Clementi Neighbourhood Police Centre as she had been the victim of an online love scam. The complainant transferred a total of S$135,030.00 to one “Andrew Wong”, whom she got to know through Facebook, over several occasions. “Andrew Wong” claimed that he needed money to clinch a contract but had no access to his own money as it was being held by “Keppel”. To help “Andrew Wong”, the complainant transferred S$50,030.00 to the DBS account on 17 August 2017. The bank deducted S$30.00 as part of its fees. “Andrew Wong” continued asking for more money and did not return any money to the complainant.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b><u>FACTS RELATING TO THE CHARGE (MAC-907605-2018)</u></b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4. Investigations revealed that sometime in early August 2017, the accused got to know one “Collins” through the “Badoo” online dating application. The accused told “Collins” that she was in debt. In response, “Collins” said that he loved her and wanted to help her. Subsequently, on 16 August 2017, the accused lied to “Collins” by saying that “everything is gone” because her handbag was snatched away by a thief on a bike. She asked “Collins” to help her with her rent and told him that she did not want to sleep on the streets. “Collins” then proposed that the accused allow her bank accounts to be used by his boss’s associates. “Collins” explained that the accused could take S$500.00 out of each transaction and bring the rest of the money to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. After asking why the money cannot be paid directly into his boss’s account, and if she would get into trouble for carrying “lots of money”, the accused agreed to “try out” the arrangement. She then provided the details of the DBS account to “Collins” but refused to provide the details of her second bank account to “Collins” despite him asking.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5. On 17 August 2017, S$50,030.00 was deposited into the DBS account by the complainant, of which S$30.00 was deducted by the bank as part of its fees. Thereafter, “Collins” told the accused to withdraw the S$50,000.00 from the DBS account and that one of his boss’s associates would call her and take the money from her. “Collins” also asked for details of the accused’s second bank account so that his boss can transfer S$26,000.00 to her and give her S$1,000.00 from the transaction, before warning her not to use an ATM to withdraw the S$50,000.00 which had already been transferred to the DBS account. This made the accused suspicious and she asked him “[i]s this money legal” via WhatsApp. She did not receive a clear answer from “Collins”.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6. On 18 August 2017, when the accused claimed that she was at the bank and talking to the bank staff about the money, “Collins” told the accused to tell the bank staff that the money was from a friend in Singapore who sent it to her for personal reasons. And when the accused informed “Collins” that her withdrawal limit was just S$2,000.00 per day, “Collins” asked if she could increase the limit to S$10,000.00 or S$9,000.00. After “Collins” kept asking the accused to start withdrawing the money from the DBS account, the accused asked him “why do I want to raise eyebrows as to where the money came from” via WhatsApp. From 18 August 2017 till 27 August 2017, “Collins” asked the accused repeatedly about the money but the accused kept making excuses and ignoring his WhatsApp voice calls. Finally, on 27 August 2017, “Collins” fell out with the accused and called her a “thief” via WhatsApp. In her responses to “Collins” via WhatsApp, the accused asked “[d]id we have a contractual agreement” and said “[w]e will see what the police will say about you using accounts for your payments”. Thereafter, the accused ignored several WhatsApp messages and voice calls from “Collins” before blocking him.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7. Instead of delivering the money as she agreed to, the accused misappropriated the money for her own use. She transferred S$31,000.00 to a Malaysian CIMB bank account on 21 August 2017 as instructed by one “Jasmin”, who was a scammer who claimed to be able to help one “Mark Anthony”. “Mark Anthony” was another scammer whom the accused was in love with. “Mark Anthony” had claimed that he was being detained by the Malaysian authorities for having too much money, and that “Jasmin” was an immigration officer who could help him. As for the remaining S$19,000.00, from 18 August 2017 to 4 September 2017, the accused spent S$1,000.00 for her own expenses and transferred the remainder to various foreign bank accounts over several occasions pursuant to the instructions of one “Chong Lee”, who had promised to give the accused S$800,000.00 for her help as part of an inheritance scam.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. By virtue of the foregoing, the accused did dishonestly misappropriate S$50,000.00 belonging to the complainant and converted it to her own use, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 403 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. The accused made full restitution of S$50,000.00 to the complainant on 6 May 2019.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## Antecedents

4       The Accused was untraced.

## TIC Charge

5       The Accused admitted and consented to a s47(3) Cap 65A offence (“the CDSA charge) to be taken into account for the purpose of sentencing.

## Address on Sentence by Prosecution

6       The Prosecution has tendered a written submission on sentence and submitted for a sentence of at least 3 months’ imprisonment.

7       It was not disputed that the Court has the discretion to order a mandatory treatment order pursuant to s339 CPC (“an MTO”).

8       The Prosecution submitted that the following main factors militated against an MTO. Firstly, it was contended that the dominant sentencing consideration was one of general deterrence as the Accused was involved in money laundering activities. Next, the Accused’s actions were deliberate and calculated over a period of about 2 weeks. It was submitted that she was a manipulative offender. It was also contended that her psychiatric conditions were not serious as to contribute to her offending in a very substantial way that warranted rehabilitation to be the dominant sentencing consideration. Moreover, the Accused maintained the “capacity to make choices” as assessed by the IMH psychiatrist.

## Submission on Sentence by Defence

9       The Defence has also tendered written submissions on sentence and submitted for an MTO.

10     At the time of the offence, the Accused was about 63 years old and a divorcee. She was estranged from her 2 children and is now residing with her cousin.

11     The IMH report indicated that the Accused spent most of her time as a teacher after completing her training at the then Teacher’s Training College of Singapore. She was once the head of a department at Anglo-Chinese School.

12     Counsel highlighted that the Accused has a clean record and cooperated fully with investigations. She suffered from Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) which made her vulnerable and susceptible to online dating scams. The Accused herself was also a victim of at least 4 such manipulative scams. Most of the monies she misappropriated were transferred to other scammers.

13     It was also highlighted that the Accused has made full restitution.

14     The Accused had pleaded guilty and was remorseful.

## Sentencing Considerations

15     Having considered the circumstances of the case and the submissions of the parties, I was of the view that the principle of rehabilitation outweighed those of retribution, prevention and deterrence. In this respect, I followed the guidance highlighted by the High Court in the case of _GCX v PP <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 14</span>_ at \[34\].

## MTO suitability Report

16     Unlike the case of _GCX v PP, supra_, the calling for the MTO suitability report was not objected to by the Prosecution. It would mean that the Prosecution recognized that the Accused possessed rehabilitation potential. It was only after the said report had been tendered that the Prosecution objected to the granting of an MTO.

17     The appointed psychiatrist found the Accused suitable for MTO and recommended a MTO for a period of 18 months.

## The other relevant factors

18     In my view, the offence committed by the Accused was not heinous or serious as the penalty prescribed was an imprisonment up to 2 years, or fine or both. The amount misappropriated was $50,000 but this sum has been fully repaid to the victim.

19     I was mindful that there was a charge (DAC 927099/2018) under s47(3) Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (“the CDSA”) but this was not proceeded. It was taken into account for the purpose of sentencing with the consent of the Accused.

## IMH Report

20     It was not disputed that the Accused was assessed by the IMH Psychiatrist to have developed “Major Depressive Disorder” of “mild severity” at the time the offence was committed and in the last 2 years before the commission of the offence. See IMH report dated 19 Dec 2018 at \[15\]. The Psychiatrist also opined that her “Major Depressive Disorder could have had some contributory link in leading to her having poor judgement in committing the offences but would not have any substantial diminution in her ability in considering the consequences of her actions.” Moreover, she was likely “cognizant that she was using money that did not belong to her, at the time of the alleged offences”. She was not of unsound mind at the material time. There was no objection by the Prosecution of the analytical process by which the conclusions were reached by the IMH Psychiatrist.

21     The Accused was treated by IMH psychiatrist and has shown good clinical improvement. If incarcerated she was advised to be “closely followed up by the prison psychiatrist to prevent further deterioration of her mood disorder.”

22     Having the benefit of the IMH report dated 19 Dec 2018, it appeared to me that although the Accused knew what she was doing and the consequences but her psychiatric disorders did lead to some minor impairments in her socio-occupational functioning and could have also impacted her judgment. In fact, the IMH psychiatrist opined at \[15\] of the IMH report that her MDD could have contributed to her having poor judgment in committing the offence. See also \[4\] of the MTO suitability report which stated clearly that the Accused suffered from MDD at the material time which contributed to the commission of the offence.

23     On the other hand, the Prosecution contended that the Accused’s mental disorder was not a very serious mental disorder and had a tenuous causal link to the commission of the offence. It was alleged that she was manipulative and had time to deliberate. Hence, the full weight can be accorded to the element of general deterrence. In my view, although the Accused was able to appreciate the consequences of her actions, her psychiatric disorders could have led her to having poor judgment in the commission of the offence. It may be that her psychiatric disorders were of mild severity, nevertheless as highlighted by the Defence, it was still serious as she had passive suicidal ideation, low mood, anhedonia, poor sleep and anxiety. Having considered the facts of the case, the IMH report and the appointed psychiatrist ‘s MTO suitability report confirming that her MDD did contribute to her commission of the offence, I was of the view that her MDD did affect in some degree towards her _mens rea_ in the commission of the offence and thereby impacted her culpability. In this respect, her culpability should not be assessed to be high as to warrant a deterrent sentence.

## Nature and Gravity of the Offence

24     It was contended that the court must be cognizant that the s403 offence was committed in the broader context of money laundering activities. Hence, general deterrence should be the predominant sentencing consideration. I was mindful that the type of punishment to be imposed was not simply dependent on the charge proffered. But I was of the view that although both the s403 offence and the CDSA charge arose from the same factual matrix, nevertheless, the nature of the s403 offence cannot be considered to be a serious offence that required deterrence to prevail over rehabilitation. The Accused was not charged with the s47 CDSA offence. The s47 CDSA charge was only to be taken into consideration to enhance the sentence to be awarded. The type of punishment to be imposed should be dependent on the gravity of the offence committed which in this case was punishable up to 2 years’ imprisonment or fine or both and the circumstances of the case. In fact, the Prosecution has categorized the nature of the offence as “a plain and simple dishonest misappropriation of property offence”. See \[10\] of the Prosecution’s Submissions. It was also not appropriate for the court, in sentencing the Accused, to consider the possibility that an alternative and graver charge might have been brought against the Accused. See _Suventer Shanmugam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span> at \[36\] which involved the importation of controlled drugs where the charge was reduced to a non-capital charge. Ultimately the type of sentence to be imposed will be largely dependent on the gravity of the offence committed and the circumstances of the case. Clearly the s403 offence was not more severe than the CDSA charge as can be seen by the penalty prescribed for the CDSA offence. Moreover, given the Accused’s background and her state of mind at the material time, her conduct appeared to be out of character.

## Character of the Accused

25     I noted that the Accused was about 63 years old. Due credit must be given to the Accused for having a clean criminal record for such a long period. She has been in the teaching profession for most of her working years. Even at her age, she was still a part-time teacher. She also had good family support from her cousin and niece. What she had done appeared to me to be an aberration.

26     The Accused was also found suitable to undergo MTO.

27     Significantly, the Accused had pleaded guilty and demonstrated her remorse.

## Role of the Accused

28     Next, the Prosecution contended that the role played by the Accused was that of a cash runner which was not a passive role. With respect, I agreed with the Defence that it was Collins, the scammer who was the mastermind. And bearing in mind the Accused’s psychiatric disorders which could have adversely clouded her judgment and the overall mind set of the Accused at the material time as disclosed in the IMH report, I would think that she did not play a very culpable role. She was probably motivated to commit the offence out of her desperation for a soulmate and confidant rather than solely be a money mule for the money laundering activities. I agreed with the Defence that the Accused was not out looking to commit fraud but for love. What she did was a misguided judgment on her part.

29     The Prosecution also submitted that there was premeditation and a conscious choice on the part of the Accused in the commission of the offence. It was contended that she was driving the “steering wheel”. With respect, these must be considered in the light of the fact that the Accused was suffering from untreated psychiatric disorders long before the commission of the offence and was desperately seeking friendship and romance because of her emotional or behavioural symptoms cussed by Persistent Depressive Disorder. These could explain why after having received the money from the scammer she misappropriated the money and gave it to another scammer “Mark Anthony” whom the Accused was in love with. See \[7\] of the SOF.

30     Accordingly, I was of the view that rehabilitation should replace deterrence as the predominant sentencing consideration.

## Conclusion

31     Having considered all the circumstances, I agreed with the Defence that imprisonment would not allow for meaningful medical intervention in light of the Prosecution’s submission for an imprisonment term of at least 3 months. This is supported by the High Court’s decision in _GCX v PP, supra_, at \[83\] that a 12 weeks’ imprisonment was not long enough to allow for a meaningful medical intervention. In such a case, treatment via a MTO and not imprisonment would be a better response.

32     In the present case, the Accused was assessed by the appointed psychiatrist to be a suitable patient for MTO and has a good family support from her cousin and niece. In the circumstances and having considered the character of the offender and the nature of the offence, I ordered the Accused to undergo MTO for a period of 18 months as recommended by the appointed psychiatrist. This, together with the fact that the Accused, being a 1st time offender subjected to prosecution and appearing in court in full view of the public, would serve the justice of the case and provide some form of deterrence.
