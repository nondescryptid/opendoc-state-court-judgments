Civil Procedure – Unless orders – Setting aside default judgment obtained pursuant to an unless order

Civil Procedure – Extension of time

4 May 2021

### Deputy Registrar Jeslyn Tan:

## Introduction

1       This action was brought by the plaintiff against the defendant for damages suffered as a result of a motor accident.

2       On 14 July 2020, an order (hereinafter referred to as the “unless order”) was made by a district judge at a court dispute resolution (“CDR”) session that the defendant exchange his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) with the plaintiff’s AEIC by 11 August 2020, failing which the defendant’s defence was to be struck out with liberty for the plaintiff to enter interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed. The defendant failed to comply with the unless order and the plaintiff obtained interlocutory judgment in its favour on 24 September 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the “Default Judgment”), pursuant to the defendant’s default.

3       About 4 months later on 20 January 2021, the defendant filed this present application to set aside the Default Judgment. As will be explained below, at the hearing before me on 5 April 2021, the defendant sought, and I granted, leave for the defendant to amend the application to include an additional prayer for an extension of time to comply with the unless order. Having considered the evidence and submissions before me, I allowed the amended application with costs to the plaintiff.

4       As there are not many local reported decisions dealing directly with the setting aside of a default judgment obtained pursuant to a breach of an unless order, I set out my detailed reasons in these written grounds to contribute to the jurisprudence that has developed thus far.

## Background

5       Parties attended several CDR sessions at the State Courts but were unable to settle the dispute. As a result, the district judge presiding over the CDR session as mediator ordered that parties exchange their respective AEICs by 28 April 2020.

6       Subsequently, an extension of time was given to the parties to exchange their respective AEICs by 7 July 2020. The plaintiff eventually filed his AEIC on 13 July 2020.

7       A second extension of time was given to the defendant in the form of the unless order. However, on 11 August 2020, when parties were due to exchange their AEICs pursuant to the unless order, the defendant failed to file and exchange his AEIC. Instead, on that day, the defendant’s solicitors sent a draft of the defendant’s AEIC to the plaintiff’s solicitors by way of email, explaining that the defendant was unable to attend before a Commissioner for Oaths to affirm his AEIC in time as he was having a fever. In the said email, the defendant’s solicitors stated that the defendant confirmed that no further changes would be made to the said draft AEIC.

8       The defendant only filed and exchanged his duly affirmed AEIC on 19 August 2020. However, the unless order had already taken effect against the defendant by then and the plaintiff had successfully obtained the Default Judgment.

## Preliminary Issue

### Whether the defendant needed to seek an extension of time to comply with the unless order before applying to set aside the Default Judgment

9       At the start of the hearing, I raised a preliminary issue as to whether there was any legal basis for this court to set aside the Default Judgment given that no extension of time was granted, nor even sought, in respect of compliance with the unless order. I drew the defendant’s solicitors’ attention to the case of _The “MMM Diana” ex “Able Director”_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 3 SLR(R) 611</span> (“_MMM Diana_”) which was cited in the case of _Yang Guoxiu v Chin Chien Yong_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 179</span> relied upon by the defendant in his written submissions. In _MMM Diana_ at \[12\], Woo Bih Li J stated:

> 12    I was of the view that the substance of what the defendants were seeking was an extension of time so as to set aside the \[default judgment\]. Put in another way, there would be no legal basis to set aside the \[default judgment\] if no extension of time were granted. The deadline under the \[unless order\] would remain unless varied by an extension of time.

10     In response, the defendant’s solicitors sought leave to amend the application to include an additional prayer for an extension of time to comply with the unless order. I granted leave for the defendant to do so with costs to be determined at the end of the hearing. I saw no reason to deny leave given that the plaintiff, in his written submissions, was aware that the defendant was effectively seeking an extension of time to comply with the unless order in this application.

## Relevant legal principles

11     The applicable principles on whether an extension of time should be granted in this case are set out in the Court of Appeal decision of _Syed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff and Another v Arjan Bhisham Chotrani_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 1 SLR(R) 361</span>. In summary, the power of the court to grant an extension of time for compliance with an unless order should be exercised cautiously and the onus is on the defaulting party to show that his default in complying with the unless order was not intentional and contumelious or contumacious, and that he had made positive efforts to comply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous circumstances. The court will take into account all the circumstances of the case including whether or not the other party has suffered prejudice and whether or not the penalty imposed is proportionate to the default in question.

## My decision

### Whether the defendant’s default was intentional and contumelious or contumacious

12     The defendant’s sole reason for breaching the unless order was that he had a fever on the day of the deadline and was therefore unable to affirm his AEIC.

13     Although the defendant did not produce any documents in support of his claim that he had a fever on the day of the deadline such as a medical certificate or a doctor’s memorandum, I accepted his evidence that he was unwell on that day. This was because his conduct in sending the plaintiff a draft AEIC which was essentially the same as that he eventually filed, on the deadline itself, showed good faith on his end in trying to comply with the unless order and in trying to overcome the alleged obstacle to his filing and exchange of an affirmed AEIC.

14     The plaintiff argued that the defendant did not demonstrate positive efforts to comply with the unless order and he ought to have instructed his solicitors to file a solicitor’s affidavit exhibiting his draft AEIC so that there would be a solicitor’s undertaking that the AEIC subsequently filed would be identical to that exhibited in the solicitor’s affidavit. I was not persuaded by this argument. Although not in the form of providing a solicitor’s undertaking, it was clear to me that a positive effort was made to give the plaintiff an express assurance that no changes would be made to the draft AEIC, and the defendant had honoured that.

15     In my view, the attempts and efforts made by the defendant as described above did not accord with the conduct of a litigant who was intentional about breaching the unless order or delaying the matter. As a result of such attempts and efforts, the plainitff did not suffer any delay in receiving the defendant’s AEIC, in substance.

### Other factors taken into account

16     The plaintiff submitted that he had been prejudiced by the defendant’s actions as it had caused delay to the resolution of this suit. While it was undisputed that the defendant was late in filing and exchanging his affirmed AEIC, and in my view gave no good reasons for his delay in making this application, I was satisfied that the prejudice suffered by the plaintiff was not one that was uncompensatable by costs.

17     In my judgment, it would be disproportionate and unjust to allow the Default Judgment to stand as penalty for the defendant’s default. Having regard to all the circumstances of this case, especially in light of the fact that the plaintiff effectively received the defendant’s AEIC by the deadline stated in the unless order, the defendant should not be summarily deprived of his chance to defend the case on the merits.

## Conclusion

18     I therefore allowed the defendant’s amended application and awarded costs in favour of the plaintiff.
