6 March 2020

### District Judge Luke Tan:

## (1)   Introduction

1       Told by the accused, Rachel Ann Fernandez, of an attractive gold investment scheme allegedly offered by DBS that provided monthly returns of 4% of the value of gold invested, an elderly victim was cheated into delivering a total of 1kg of gold bars to the accused. However, shortly after receiving the gold bars, the accused pawned them and kept the proceeds for herself.

2       For her acts, the accused was charged with committing an offence of cheating under section 417 of the Penal Code. The charge reads:

> “You…. are charged that you, on or about 15 March 2016, in Singapore, did cheat one Nisha Krishnan Vanajah, \[“the victim”\] by deceiving her into believing that you could assist her in participating in a gold investment scheme offered by DBS Bank Limited which gave a monthly return of 4% of the value of gold invested, a fact which you knew was false, and by such deception, you dishonestly induced the said Nisha Krishnan Vanajah into delivering to you ten pieces of 100 gram gold bars valued at S$56,000, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (2008 Revised Edition).”

3       In addition to the cheating charge, the accused also had a second charge tendered against her. This was for an offence under section 471 read with section 465 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. For this charge, the accused was alleged to have fraudulently used as genuine a forged electronic record, namely, a screenshot of an electronic mail dated 19 October 2016 purportedly sent by one Piyush Gupta of DBS Bank Limited.

4       In respect of both charges, the accused initially indicated that she intended to claim trial. However, before the trial was due to commence, the accused had a change of position, and on 6 February 2020, she plead guilty to the cheating charge (the proceeded charge), and consented to having the remaining charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charge”).

5       Having considered the facts of the case, the sentencing submissions tendered by the Prosecution as well as the accused’s mitigation plea, I sentenced the accused to 7 months’ imprisonment in respect of the proceeded charge. Thereafter, at her request, I deferred the commencement of the accused’s sentence to 27 February 2020.

6       On 20 February 2020, about two weeks from the date she pleaded guilty, the accused filed a notice appeal against sentence. I subsequently granted a stay of execution of the sentence and granted her bail pending appeal. I now give my grounds of decision on sentence.

## (2)   The Statement of Facts (SOF)

7       The accused admitted to the contents of the “Statement of Facts” (SOF) without qualification. I have reproduced the the SOF below, with some parts underlined for emphasis.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="100%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Statement of Facts</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Persons Involved</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">1. The accused is one Rachel Ann Fernandez (“<b>accused</b>”), a 38-year old, female, Singapore citizen bearing NRIC No. XXX At the material time of the offences, the accused was the sole director and shareholder of Rey Del Wealth Management Pte Ltd (“<b>RDWM</b>”). RDWM was registered as an investment holding company.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">2. The victim is one Nisha Krishnan Vanajah (“<b>Nisha</b>”), a 63-year old, female, Singapore citizen. She was previously employed as an aircraft technician and later as a relief teacher. At present, she is retired and unemployed.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Background</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">3. The victim was introduced to the accused by her eldest sister, one Krishnan Devayani (“<b>Devayani</b>”), sometime in early 2016. At the material time, Devayani had already invested various sums of monies with RDWM, over a period of 3 years, between 2012 and 2015 and she was expecting to receive her investment sum back from the accused. Devayani understood that the accused was acting as a broker for a gold mining business opportunity in the Philippines and the accused had promised her that she would receive attractive returns at the end of 3 years.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">4. Shortly before Devayani was due to receive her investment sum back, the accused informed her about another investment opportunity involving the placement of gold bars. As Devayani had yet to receive her investment sum back, she decided to inform Nisha about the gold bar investment opportunity. Nisha knew that Devayani had trusted the accused with her monies and agreed to meet the accused to discuss the gold bar investment opportunity.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Facts relating to DAC 930341 of 2018</b></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">5. On 15<sup>th</sup> March 2016, the accused and her mother, dropped in at Nisha’s residence to discuss the gold bar business opportunity. The accused represented to Nisha that she could assist her to participate in a gold investment opportunity offered by DBS Bank Limited (“<b>DBS</b>”). This investment opportunity required Nisha to hand over gold bars that would be deposited with DBS. In return, Nisha would receive a monthly return of 4% of the value of the gold bars, each month, over a period of 3 months. At the end of the investment period, the same gold bars would be returned to Nisha. At the material time, when the accused made this representation to Nisha, the accused knew there was no such investment opportunity being offered by DBS.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">6. Nisha decided to invest in the gold bar investment opportunity and handed over 10 pieces of gold bars, each weighing 100 grams, to the accused. Prior to handing over the gold bars, Nisha took a photograph of the gold bars for her own record. Each of the 10 gold bars had imprinted on them unique serial numbers, as follows:</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(a) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 358728</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(b) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 391984</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(c) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 346545</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(d) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 392061</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(e) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 308782</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(f) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 358731</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(g) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 246148</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(h) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 259082</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(i) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 262379</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(j) Suisse 100g Fine Gold 999.9 - 358727</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">7. Both Nisha and the accused agreed that the total value of the 10 pieces of gold bars (weighing 1 kilogram) was worth S$56,000/-. Accordingly, the accused represented to Nisha that she would receive a monthly interest payment of S$2,240/-, over a period of 3 months, based on 4% monthly interest.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">8. Shortly after the accused and her mother left Nisha’s residence with the 10 pieces of gold bars, Nisha realised that she did not receive any formal receipt from the accused. She immediately sent a SMS message to the accused requesting for an acknowledgement. The accused replied by SMS and listed the serial numbers of all 10 pieces of gold bars and affirmed that she had collected them from Nisha on 15<sup>th</sup> March 2016.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">9. Investigations revealed that <u>shortly after collecting the 10 pieces of gold bars from Nisha, the accused and her mother immediately went to Valuemax Pawnshop (PR) (East) located at Blk 442, Pasir Ris Drive 6, #01-24, Singapore and pawned the gold bars for a total cash value of S$52,000/-.</u> The pawnshop also recorded the serial numbers of the 10 pieces of gold bars in their system, which matched the serial numbers of the 10 pieces of gold bars that the accused had collected from Nisha.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10. <u>About a week after the accused had pawned the gold bars</u>, Nisha received her first interest payment of S$2,240/- from the accused. <u>The accused also gave a document titled “Ray Del Wealth” addressed to Nisha which acknowledged that the company had accepted the 10 pieces of gold bars for investment purposes</u>. This document also listed the serial numbers of the gold bars that the accused had pawned on 15<sup>th</sup> March 2016.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11. Thereafter, Nisha did not receive any other payments from the accused.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">12. Throughout the period from April 2016 to July 2016, <u>Nisha sent several reminder messages to the accused seeking an update on the gold bar investment but the accused kept rebuffing her with excuses. Sometime in end April 2016 or early May 2016, the accused arranged to meet Nisha at the dialysis center where Devayani was receiving treatment. At this meeting, the accused assured Nisha that her gold bar investment was safe and she gave Nisha a handwritten ‘letter of guarantee’ that assured her of payment within 7 working days, failing which Nisha could go to the police</u>. The accused signed the handwritten ‘letter of guarantee’. However, there were no payments made to Nisha.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13. Sometime in August 2016, <u>the accused succeeded in convincing Nisha that DBS had extended the investment period from 3 months to 6 months and that all the outstanding interest payments and the 10 pieces of gold bars would be returned to her sometime in October 2016.</u></p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">14. In October 2016, <u>Nisha again made several appointments with the accused to go to DBS to retrieve the 10 pieces of gold bars and collect the outstanding interest payments</u>. <u>However, on each occasion the accused made an excuse and cancelled their meeting at the last moment</u>.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">15. Then, sometime on or about 26<sup>th</sup> October 2016, the <u>accused forwarded to Devayani via </u><em><u>Whatsapp </u></em><u>a screenshot of a fake email dated 19<sup>th</sup> October 2016 purportedly sent by “Piyush Gupta”, on behalf of DBS</u>, to the accused’s email address. In this email, DBS instructed the accused to collect her “<em>interest and items</em>” on 2 November 2016. Upon receiving the Whatsapp screenshot of the fake email from DBS, Devayani immediately forwarded it to Nisha. However, on 2<sup>nd</sup> November 2016, the accused again failed to meet up with Nisha and Devayani.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">16. By this time, Nisha had serious doubts about the authenticity of the gold bar investment opportunity at DBS. When the accused repeatedly failed to make good on her promises, Nisha eventually decided to file a police report on 23<sup>rd</sup> February 2017.</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17. Thus, the accused did deceive Nisha into believing that she could assist her to participate in a gold investment scheme offered by DBS, which offered monthly returns of 4% of the value of gold investment, a fact that the accused knew was false. By such manner of deception, the accused dishonestly induced Nisha into delivering to her ten 100-gram gold bars valued at $56,000. The accused has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 417 of the Penal Code (Cap. 224), and is charged accordingly.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

## (3)   Prescribed punishment and the accused’s antecedents

8       The maximum punishment that may be imposed on accused for the proceeded charge is an imprisonment term which may extend to 3 years, or with a fine, or with both.

9       The accused is not a first offender, as she has a previous conviction on 27th February 2012 for assisting an unlicensed moneylender. For that offence, the sentence that she received (on appeal) was an imprisonment term of 2 weeks, and a fine of $30,000 (in default 6 weeks’ imprisonment). The fine imposed was not paid.

## (4)   Prosecution’s submissions

10     In the “Prosecution’s Skeletal Submission on Sentence”, DPP Asoka Markandu argued for a sentence of at least 9 months’ imprisonment. The essential features of his submissions are set out below.

11     First, the DPP submitted that the decision of the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Idya Nurhazlyn bte Ahmad Khir v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 1 SLR 756</span> (“_Nuhazlyn_”), justified the imposition of a custodial sentence for the following reasons:

> (1)      The value of the property involved: At \[47\], Sundaresh Menon CJ had stated:“…in my judgment, a custodial sentence will generally be appropriate as long as the offence in question causes a victim to part with property that has more than negligible value.” In addition, at \[48\], Sundaresh Menon CJ had also stated that: “The primary yardstick will often be the value of the property involved.” In the present case, the DPP argued that the victim had suffered a loss of 10 pieces of gold bars (weighing 1 kilogram in total), and that “(w)ith fluctuating movement of gold prices, the victim’s loss is actually immeasurable.”[^1]

> (2)      The misuse of a financial instrument or facility was involved: At \[48\], Sundaresh Menon CJ had further stated that: “… where the offence entails the misuse of a financial instrument or facility which threatens the conduct of legitimate commerce, the need for general deterrence is likely to take centre stage..”. In this regard, DPP Asoka stated that, amongst other things, the accused had told the victim that DBS bank was promoting the gold investment scheme.

12     Second, the Prosecution highlighted various sentencing factors:

> (1)      The value of property involved was significant: The gold bars, which were assessed by the pawnbroker as being valued at $56,000, were investments that the victim had planned to divest when gold prices moved up.

> (2)      There was high level of planning and premeditation involved: The accused had hatched the gold investment scheme to attract the victim’s sister to invest more monies with her. The DPP argued that the accused also knew from the outset that she would have to constantly lie to the victim about the gold investment scheme so as to make her believe that the scheme was genuine, and that she did this by:

>> (i)       Sending an SMS to acknowledge the receipt of the gold bars;

>> (ii)       Issuing a letter with a header showing “Ray Del Wealth”;

>> (iii)       Issuing a letter of guarantee to the victim;

>> (iv)       Deceiving the victim into believing that DBS had extended the scheme from 3 months to 6 months; and

>> (v)       Sending a Whatsapp screenshot of a fake email, purportedly sent by Piyush Gupta on behalf of DBS, to the accused.

> (3)      Duration of deception – The deception was carried out over a period of 11 months, and this was made possible because of the high level of trust the accused had developed with the victim’s sister.

> (4)      The misuse of financial instrument – The DPP submitted that while gold investment schemes are a common feature in our banking system, the use by the accused of the “DBS” brand to lend credence to her investment scheme threatens the conduct of legitimate gold investment schemes promoted by financial institutions.

> (5)      No weight should be given to the restitution as an indication of the accused’s remorse – The DPP argued that this was because restitution had been made very late in the day, and was not a true reflection of her remorse but was done only to persuade the court to impose a lenient sentence. The DPP highlighted that the accused had initially claimed trial but the first set of trial dates were vacated when she produced a medical certificate to show that she was unable to attend court. When fresh trial dates were given, she did not give any indication of an intention to make restitution. The accused only communicated her intention two days before the start of trial, and the first day of trial had to be vacated to facilitate the accused’s request to make use of bail monies to make restitution to the victim.

> (6)      The accused is not a first time offender: The DPP highlighted that the accused has an antecedent for assisting an unlicensed moneylender in 2012 for which she had received a custodial sentence.

13     The DPP also made reference to several cases involving cheating under section 417 of the Penal Code, which he argued supported the Prosecution’s sentencing positon. In respect for each of these cases, the offender had no antecedents, and had also made full restitution.

> (1)     For the first case of _Nuhazlyn_, the offender had pleaded guilty and was convicted on two charges under s 417 of the Penal Code, and four charges of making a false statement under s 39(1) of the Passports Act. Two other charges under s 417 of the Penal Code and five charges under s 39 of the Passports Act were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. On appeal, the High Court imposed a global sentence of 4 ½ months’ imprisonment, with the following sentences for the specific s 417 cheating offences:

>> (i)       Where the sum involved was $10,509: 3 months’ imprisonment

>> (ii)       Where the sum involved was $1,800: 1 month’s imprisonment

> (2)     In _PP v Chen Young Ja_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGDC 454</span> (“_Chen Young Ja”)_, the offender had dishonestly represented to the two victims that he had an investment scheme that would yield high returns, and thus induced the victims to invest various sums of monies. There, the court had imposed a global sentence of 5 months’ imprisonment where the total amount involved was S$25,280.31. The global sentence consisted of two consecutive sentences: a sentence of 4 months imprisonment involving a transaction of S$18,000, and a sentence of 1 month’s imprisonment for a transaction of $1,900.

> (3)     In _PP v Lee Hwai San Adrian Matthew_, <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 271</span>, where the amount cheated was S$25,000 per charge, a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment for each charge was imposed. There was a similar cheating charge that was taken into consideration for sentencing, and the total amount involved, including for the TIC charge, was $65,000. The global sentence was 4 months’ imprisonment in all.

> (4)     In _PP v Chen Chen Chang_, the accused pleaded guilty on 6th October 2017 to 6 proceeded charges involving a total amount of $66,027.50. 18 other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The total amount involved, including for the TIC charges, was $138,102.50. The global sentence imposed was 12 months’ imprisonment.

14     Thus, in light of the above cases, and the aggravating circumstances, the Prosecution argued that a sentence of at least 9 months’ imprisonment for the amount of S$56,000 involved in the present case was justified.

## (5)   Mitigation Plea

15     The Defence Counsel, Mr Dhanwant Singh, tendered a written mitigation plea. In essence, Mr Singh highlighted several factors that he argued would justify the imposition of a fine instead of a custodial sentence. Alternatively, Mr Singh asked for a custodial sentence “caliberated \[_sic_\] downwards by the imposition of a fine as well; as an example a 2 weeks jail term and a fine of $10,000 may be imposed…”.[^2]

16     His arguments are summarised below:

> (1)     First, Mr Singh argued that the accused’s plea of guilt, before the trial commenced, demonstrated her genuine remorse which justifies a reduction in sentence (citing _Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v PP_ \[2006\] 4 SLR (R) 653) of between ¼ to 1/3 of the sentence that might have been imposed if there had been a conviction after trial.

> (2)     Next, he argued that the accused had actually made full restitution, as the sum of $56,000, which she has surrendered, was the agreed value of the 10 pieces of gold bars that the victim had delivered as a result of the offence. Mr Singh submitted that this had “…restored the victim's status quo (financially), as evenly as possible…”[^3]

> (3)     Further, he urged the court to disregard the accused’s previous conviction as it was for a dissimilar offence, and that “… it may be stated confidently, currently she is a first offender for all intents and purposes.\[See _Roslan Bin Abdul Rahman_ \[1999\] 1 SLR (R) 377…”.[^4]

## (6)   Decision by the Court

### (a)   A custodial sentence is appropriate in the circumstances

17     At the onset, I would state that I agree with the position set out by the DPP in his comprehensive submissions that a custodial sentence was clearly in order. This positon is in line with the decision of Sundaresh Menon CJ in _Nuhazlyn_ at \[47\] that a custodial sentence would generally be appropriate for such offences when the property involved has more than negligible value.

18     Further, I note that in _Nuhazlyn_, after the learned Chief Justice had reviewed the precedent cases cited in Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (Lexis Nexis, 3rd Edition 2013), his Honour had remarked that: “These cases indicate that custodial sentences for terms of between four and eight months’ imprisonment have been imposed for cheating offences that resulted in losses of between $1,000 and $15,000”.

19     Thus, in light of the value of the property involved in the present case i.e. the 10 gold bars which were valued at $56,000, the imposition of a substantial custodial sentence was clearly warranted.

20     While the above consideration would be sufficient to refute Mr Singh’s submission that a fine alone was an appropriate sentence, I would add that I also found no merit in Mr Singh’s suggestion for any jail term to be “…“caliberated \[_sic_\] downwards by the imposition of a fine as well…”. In this regard, while s 417 of the Penal Code provides for the possibility of imposing a \`combination sentence’ consisting of an imprisonment term and a fine, such a hybrid sentence was not in line with the sentences imposed in any of the cases cited by either the Prosecution or the Defence. Further, while it has been recognised that “(a)s a general rule, the purpose of imposing a fine in addition to an imprisonment term is to disgorge the offender’s substantial benefit from his offending” (per Chan Seng Onn J in _Ding Si Yang v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ \[2015\] SGHC 08 at \[109\]), since the Defence here had argued that full restitution had in fact been made, there was really no reason for a fine to be imposed for this case, as there was prima facie no question of there being any need to “disgorge the offender’s substantial benefit from \[her\] offending”.

21     Further, to adopt the approach suggested by counsel of imposing a sentence of a fine apparently just so as to reduce the length of an otherwise appropriate custodial term, this would, in my respectful view, be clearly an incorrect course of action. Such a practice, if adopted could unfairly penalise an offender who is impecunious and who could not afford to pay the fine imposed, hence having to serve an overall longer custodial term (in the form of an additional default imprisonment sentence in lieu of payment of the fine). This is in contrast to an equally blameworthy offender who could afford to pay such a fine, and hence escape having to serve a default imprisonment sentence. This could be viewed as a perverse and unfair outcome, as the latter offender could almost be said to have used money to “pay for” a shorter term of imprisonment, when both offenders should have received the same (more appropriate) custodial term.

22     In short, the only sentencing option that should be considered, in light of the precedent cases, was an appropriate custodial sentence simpliciter. It is to the length of the custodial term that I now turn my attention to.

### (b)   The length of the custodial term

23     In arguing for an imprisonment sentence of least 9 months, aside from citing precedent cases, DPP Asoka had highlighted matters that he argued were aggravating factors. These have been summarised at \[12\] above.

24     As regards the factors cited by the DPP, I would begin by stating that I agree with many aspects of the Prosecution’s submissions on sentence. In particular, I accept the DPP’s argument that the value of the property involved in the cheating charge was clearly substantial, and that this should point towards a significant custodial sentence being imposed. In this regard, aside from the case of _Nuhazlyn_ discussed above, I would also highlight that in the recent case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 42</span> (“_Anne Gan_”), the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had reiterated at \[42\] that: “There is a well-established general principle that in sentencing for financial and property offences, the greater the economic value involved in the offence, the heavier the sentence.”.

25     In addition, I agree that some of the other factors highlighted by the Prosecution, including the accused’s use and abuse of the DBS brand in carrying out the offence, and the overall detrimental effect of the accused’s actions on legitimate gold investment schemes promoted by financial institutions, were considerations broadly supportive of the Prosecution’s position for the imposition of a relatively long period of imprisonment. In addition, I also note that the accused had targeted an elderly victim in the present case.

26     Thus, based on these considerations and consistent with sentences set out in the above cited cases, especially the decision in _Chen Young Ja_ (5 months’ imprisonment where the total amount involved was S$25,280.31), which was a case that also involved an investment scam and which bore many other similarities with the present case (albeit the offender there had a rather dated 2004 cheating antecedent for which he was placed on probation), there would appear to be strong reasons why a sentence of at least 9 months’ imprisonment may have been an appropriate sentence to impose in the present case.

27     However, there were some aspects of the Prosecution’s submissions that I found difficulty in accepting. For one, while I agree that there was clear planning by the accused in the commission of the offence, as shown by the distinct and clearly well thought through representations that the accused made) about the gold investment scheme, first to the victim’s sister (Devayani), and then subsequently repeated to the victim when the latter showed interest in the investment,[^5] I do not agree that the other examples cited by the Prosecution as evidence of planning and premeditation (summarised at \[12(2)\] above), could necessarily be classified in this manner.

28     In this regard, actions of the accused such as her sending an SMS to acknowledge the receipt of the gold bars, her issuing of various letters and the sending of screenshots etc., were all actions carried out by the accused after the offence of cheating had already been completed on 15 March 2016. Such actions also apparently had more to do with the accused trying to prevent the victim from discovering that she had been cheated, rather than necessarily being evidence of planning and preparation by the accused, carried out towards the initial commission of the offence. Specifically, there was no clear evidence presented to show that the accused had already thought of, or had intended to carry out any (let alone all) of these additional steps prior to, or in order to, facilitate the commission of the actual offence on 15 March 2016 itself.

29     I was thus of the view that based on the available evidence, such subsequent actions of the accused, including her fraudulent use of the forged electronic record (which was the subject matter of the TIC charge), could at best be said to be demonstrative of the accused’s continuing deception of the victim (for a further 11 months), rather than as evidence of prior planning or premeditation.

30     As for the issue of restitution, I note the positon taken by the DPP that no weight should be given to the restitution of $56,000 made by the accused as an indication of her alleged remorse, since this money was given up only after trial dates were given. Also, the DPP had argued that the money was handed over not because the accused was remorseful but because she wanted a lighter sentence. Further, the DPP submitted that while the accused had returned the sum of $56,000, which was the agreed value of the gold bars when it was delivered to the accused by the victim, what the victim actually wanted out of the arrangement were the promised returns of $6,720 (i.e. $2,240 per month for a period of 3 months) and the return of the gold bars after the \`investment period’, presumably to sell for a higher price in the future, rather than for the sum of $56,000 that the accused had handed over.

31     However, with due respect to the Prosecution, I took the view that the handing over of the $56,000 by the accused was a significant mitigating factor in her favour:

> (1)     In this regard, I would highlight the words of the learned Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon in _Anne Gan_ at \[62\], where his Honour had made clear that “(a)n offender’s making of timely and voluntary restitution for loss caused by his offending conduct has generally been regarded in the cases as evidence of his remorse, and therefore as a mitigating factor.” Further, Sundaresh Menon CJ had added at \[63\] that: “…restitution is not necessarily limited in its significance to being evidence of remorse. In my judgment, it may also indicate that the economic harm that the victim has suffered has been reduced, and indeed, substantially reduced if full restitution was made.” Thus, in line with the above guidance provided by the learned Chief Justice, even if it could be argued that the weight of any restitution should be reduced because it was only made at a relatively late stage, the fact remains that this action of the accused had reduced (even if it could be argued that it had not completely eliminated) the economic harm that the victim suffered.

> (2)     In addition, while the DPP had argued that what the victim really wanted was the return of the gold bars (and her promised interest of $6,720), rather than the sum of $56,000 that the accused ultimately paid back, I note that there was nothing presented to indicate that the victim had, directly or through the enforcement agencies, asked the accused to make restitution by returning to her an equivalent number (or weight) of gold bars, rather than through payment of the sum of $56,000.

> (3)     Further, there was no evidence presented that that the $56,000 handed over by the accused would not have been sufficient for the victim to use to pay for an equivalent number (or weight) of gold bars, if she should wish to do so upon her receipt of the money. As for the victim’s alleged “lost profits” of $6,720, I was of the respectful view that the purpose of any act of restitution by an offender is essentially to restore to the victim the value of what she had lost, rather than to provide her with the profits she would otherwise have gained, if there been no offence to begin with.

> (4)     In addition, for completeness and in response to a point raised by counsel in oral mitigation,[^6] I would clarify that while I had broadly taken the view that full restitution had essentially been made to the victim through the payment of $56,000 to her by the accused, I disregarded the fact that an additional sum of $2,240 had also been given to the victim by the accused before the offence was discovered. In this regard, as reflected in the SOF, the $2,240 was paid to the victim about a week after the accused had pawned the gold bars, and was purportedly given as the initial first month’s returns for the victim’s “investment” in the scheme (see \[10\] of the SOF). However, as with the document titled “Ray Del Wealth”, which was also given by the accused to the victim, this time to acknowledge “…that the company had accepted the 10 pieces of gold bars for investment purposes”, it would appear that both these acts of the accused i.e. the “initial payment” of the “returns” to the victim, as well as the provision of this “acknowledgement”, were all actions carried out by the accused only to perpetuate further deception, and to convince the victim that the gold investment scheme was legitimate. Hence, such acts were of no mitigating value.

32     Finally, I also considered, in the accused’s favour, her plea of guilt. In this regard, a plea of guilt, aside from evidencing “…the offender’s remorse, saves the victim the prospect of reliving his or her trauma at trial, or saves the public costs which would have been expended by holding a trial.” (see _Anne Gan_ at \[73\]). While I agree that the accused’s plea of guilt could not be said to have been made at an early stage of the proceedings, I did still take into account the fact that by her plea of guilt in the present case, the accused had avoided the need for a elderly victim having to give evidence in court. As such, I gave due weight to the accused’s guilty plea in deciding on the sentence.

33     For completeness, I would add that in deciding on the appropriate sentence, I disregarded the accused’s antecedent for the moneylending offence as this was dissimilar in nature. I would add that the approach I adopted on this issue, was also consistent with the position put forward by the DPP. [^7]

34     All in all, having looked at the precedents, and the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, I was of the view that a sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment, rather than the sentence of at least 9 months’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution, or the fine and/or short imprisonment term proposed by the Defence, would be a fair and proportionate sentence to impose in the circumstances.

35     The accused, being dissatisfied, has filed an appeal against sentence. She is currently on bail pending the hearing of the appeal.
