\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 001/2019/01\]

19 March 2019

### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 48-year old Singaporean, is a local director of nine companies (‘the companies’) that were incorporated in Singapore. These companies failed to hold their annual general meetings (‘AGMs’) and also failed to lodge their annual returns (‘ARs’) over a number of years between 2011 to 2017 as required under the Companies Act (Cap. 50)(‘the Act’). The accused, in his capacity of an officer of these companies, was charged with 54 counts of knowingly and wilfully permitting the companies to default in their statutory obligations. He was represented by counsel and contested the charges. At the conclusion of the trial, he was convicted of all the charges and fined $2,100 for each charge.

2       He is appealing only against the order of conviction having paid the total fine of $113,400 in full.

## Charges

3       For ease of reference, I will only set out two charges for failing to hold the AGM and to file the AR respectively for a specified year (2016) in respect of one of the companies (Faxlink Trading Pte Ltd). These are charges under s 175 and s 197 of the Act respectively. The charges against the other companies are similarly framed, save for the name of the company, its registration number and the date of the breach. The two charges for easy reference are reproduced as follows:

Failing to hold AGM

You…on or around 24 November 2016, in Singapore, being a director of Faxlink Trading Pte Ltd (198903432W) (“the Company”), a company incorporated in Singapore, did knowingly and wilfully permit the Company to default in holding an annual general meeting as required under section 175(1) of the Companies Act, to wit, you permitted the Company to not hold its annual general meeting by 24 November 2016, the Company thereby contravened section 175(4)(a) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 2006 Revised Edition) (“the Act”), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 175(4)(a) of the Act read with section 408(3)(b) of the Act.

Failing to file AR

You…on or around 24 December 2016, in Singapore, being a director of Faxlink Trading Pte Ltd (198903432W) (“the Company”), a company incorporated in Singapore, did knowingly and wilfully permit the Company to fail to lodge an annual return as required under section 197(1) of the Companies Act, to wit, you permitted the Company to fail to lodge its annual return by 24 December 2016, the Company thereby contravened section 197(6) of the Companies Act (Chapter 50, 2006 Revised Edition) (“the Act”), and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 197(6) of the Act read with section 408(3)(b) of the Act.

4       For the charges for failing to file an AR, it is also pointed out by the prosecution[^1] that the Companies (Amendment) Act 2014 amended the timeframe for filing an AR from within one month of the date of the AGM to within 30 days. Further, for offences committed before 3 January 2016, the offence section number is s 197(7) whereas for offences committed on or after that date, the offence section number is s 197(6).

5       For completeness, I point out that the reference in the charges to s 408(3)(b) of the Act provides for a default penalty in respect of a continuing offence. However, the issue of any continuing offence was not pursued by the prosecution in the present case.

## The Prosecution’s Case

6       The facts are largely undisputed. The accused holds an accountancy degree and is a qualified chartered accountant in Singapore. He is also the general manager and director of Asian Corporate Service (SEA) Pte Ltd (‘ACS’), a company providing corporate secretarial services. He has been the general manager of ACS for 15 years from April 2004. At all material times, ACS is a registered filing agent (‘RFA’) and the accused is the authorised person to carry out electronic transactions with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (‘ACRA’) on behalf of ACS.

7       It is not disputed that the accused is a director of some 39 companies and was first appointed as a director of a company as far back as 2001. In short, the accused has been in this business for some 20 years. In respect of the charges and at all material times, it is not in dispute that the accused was the sole local director of the nine companies. I set out the material particulars of the accused’s directorship as provided by the prosecution in a table[^2]:

8       It is not in dispute that the companies in question did not hold an AGM or file an AR within the material dates as reflected in the charges. The deadlines that were breached span a number of years between 2011 to 2017 and are comprehensively set out in the conditioned statement[^3] of the representative of ACRA[^4] who gave evidence for the prosecution.

9       It is also undisputed that the accused did not apply to ACRA for an extension of time to comply with the statutory requirements in respect of any of the charges. Apart from two letters from the accused or his lawyers to explain the circumstances in respect of one of the companies named in the charges, he did not inform ACRA of any difficulties in holding the AGMs or filing the ARs in respect of the remaining companies. The accused also did not make any representations in respect of the charges before the summonses were issued against him to answer the charges.

10     The prosecution also relied on the following concessions by the accused in respect of the charges:

(i)     That he did not issue a notice to call for the AGM to be held;[^5]

(ii)     That he did not apply for an extension of time to hold any of the AGMs;[^6]

(iii)     That he did not apply to dispense with holding the AGMs under s 175A of the Act;[^7]

(iv)     That he was aware of the avenue of[^8] but did not make any application to ACRA to file the ARs even though an AGM could not be held due to a variety of reasons including the lack of a quorum and/or where two directors signatures could not be obtained;[^9]and

(v)     That he did not make any applications to the High Court concerning the holding of any AGM or for an order to hold an AGM because of any difficulty.[^10]

11     Finally, it is not in dispute that ACRA had sent the accused reminders to hold the AGM and file the AR before the due dates in respect of the companies.[^11]

## The Defence

12     The accused took the stand to give evidence. He was the only witness for the defence.

13     The accused testified that he was only a nominee director of the companies in question, being appointed to comply with s 145(1) of the Act which mandates that every company shall have at least one director who is ordinarily resident in Singapore. He is also the sole director who is resident in Singapore.

14     Essentially, the accused’s defence is that he had difficulties either contacting the foreign directors and shareholders of the companies or getting them to sign or provide him with the necessary documents and accounts in order to hold an AGM and file the AR within the statutory time frame after the AGM. Therefore, despite all his efforts and due diligence, he was unable to hold the AGM or file the AR in respect of the companies within the statutory time frames. In this regard, the prosecution has summarised the steps the accused took, and the reasons or causes which led to the statutory breaches, in the form of a table.[^12] As these facts are not in dispute, I will adopt and set out the summary as follows:

15     As emphasised by the shaded boxes, the accused did not lose contact with the foreign directors of three of the companies.

16     The defence also relied on the fact that the accused wrote to ACRA on 10 August 2012[^33] and on 23 September 2013[^34] (through his lawyers) to explain that he was only the nominee director in respect of one of the companies (Oliver Wight Asia Pacific (Singapore) Pte Ltd, and that he has difficulties contacting the controlling director of the company (who resides overseas) to provide the necessary documents in order to file the AR or hold the AGM. The accused represented that the controlling director has, in effect, abandoned the company which is dormant.

17     ACRA replied essentially that it is not in a position to interfere with the internal disputes of the company and advised the accused that if the company is indeed dormant, he should take steps to strike off the name of the company from ACRA’s registers. ACRA enclosed references to the guidelines on an application for striking off a company. Once that is done, the accused may have the charges compounded.

18     The accused testified that he did not find ACRA’s advice useful because it is the case for the defence that the accused was not in a position to apply to ACRA to deregister the companies.

19     In summary, the accused’s defence is that he could not give notice to hold an AGM because the foreign directors and shareholders were either non-contactable or had failed to provide (despite repeated pleas and reminders from the accused) the accounting records and critical documents which are necessary to hold an AGM and thereafter to file the AR.[^35]

20     The accused also took the position that he did not or was not given the go-ahead by the foreign directors and shareholders to strike off the companies.[^36] Further, to do so would render him in breach of his fiduciary duties as a director and contractual duties as a corporate services provider.

## The Court’s Findings and Decision

### Statutory provisions

21     The requirement to hold an AGM is provided in s 175 of the Act:

(1)    A general meeting of every company to be called the ‘annual general meeting’ shall in addition to any other meeting be held once in every calendar year and not more than 15 months after the holding of the last preceding annual general meeting, but so long as a company holds its first annual general meeting within 18 months of its incorporation, it need not hold it in the year of its incorporation or in the following year.

(4)    If default is made in holding an annual general meeting –

(a)    the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and also to a default penalty; and

(b)    the Court may on the application of any member order a general meeting to be held.

22     The requirement to file an AR is provided in s 197 of the Act:

(1)    Every company having a share capital shall lodge a return with the Registrar containing the particulars referred to in the Eighth Schedule and accompanied by such copies of documents as may be prescribed.

(4)    The annual return shall be lodged with the Registrar within one month or in the case of a company keeping pursuant to its articles a branch register in any place outside Singapore within 2 months after the annual general meeting.

(7)    If a company fails to comply with this section, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 and also to a default penalty.

As pointed out earlier, if the failure to file an AR was committed before 3 January 2016, the offence section number is s 197(7). If it was committed on or after that date, the offence section number would be s 197(6).

23     The phrase “officer of the company who is in default” is defined in s 408 of the Act as follows:

(3)    For the purposes of any provision of this Act which provides that an officer of a company or corporation who is in default is guilty of an offence or is liable to a penalty or punishment, the phrase “officer who is in default” or any like phrase means any officer of the company or corporation who knowingly and wilfully –

(a)    is guilty of the offence; or

(b)    authorises or _permits the commission of the offence_.

(emphasis added)

24     The term “officer” is in turn defined in s 4 of the Act to mean any director of a company.

25     It is not disputed that the accused is an officer of the companies in respect of the charges.

### Main issue

26     The defence does not dispute[^37] and I find that the _actus reus_ in respect of all the charges is made out i.e. that the AGMs were not held and the ARs were not filed within the dates as mandated by statute. The prosecution contends that the accused, being a director (i.e. an officer of the companies in question) has permitted the commission of the offences by the company of not holding the AGMs and filing the necessary ARs.

27     It is common ground between the parties that the main issue before the court is whether the accused had the requisite _mens rea_. Specifically, the court has to decide beyond reasonable doubt whether the accused did “knowingly and wilfully permit” the statutory breaches by the companies.[^38]

### Director’s duty

28     As pointed out by the prosecution, s 157A of the Act provides that the business of a company shall be managed by or under the direction of directors. To this end, s 157 of the Act, which spells out the duty and liability of officers of a company, specifically mandates in subsection (1) that a director “_shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office_.” It is not disputed and the defence accepts that the accused has the statutory obligation and duty to act with reasonable diligence in respect of holding AGMs and filing ARs in respect of the companies in question. The accused’s defence, which is rejected, is that he did act with reasonable diligence but in spite of his efforts and because of the circumstances, he was not able to hold the AGMs or file the ARs.

29     It is a requirement under s 145(1) of the Act that every company shall have at least one director who is ordinarily resident in Singapore. It is also provided that if the company has only one member, that sole director may also be the sole member of the company. It is not disputed that the accused is the Singapore resident director in all the companies in question so as to comply with s 145(1) of the Act. He was appointed as a nominee director by the companies under ‘Nominee Service Agreements’ (‘NSAs’) which ACS signed with the companies. Copies of the relevant NSAs were tendered in evidence.[^39]

30     The defence’s primary contention that the accused had acted with reasonable diligence appears to be grounded on the premise that he was merely a ‘nominee’ director as opposed to being one of the ‘controlling’ directors who resided overseas i.e. the foreign directors. After all, he was merely a corporate services provider (‘CSP’) and therefore a director only in name. This argument suggests that the standard of duty imposed on him as a nominee director is somewhat lower than that of the other directors. As such, his duty does not extend beyond anything more than mere corporate secretarial duties. I find that the defence argument and premise for that argument to be erroneous and flawed.

31     I accept the prosecution’s position, which was plainly conveyed to the accused in ACRA’s reply[^40] to him as far back as in 2012 when the accused first wrote to ACRA, that a person who has agreed to take on the role of a director of a company must be responsible to ensure that the company comply with the statutory requirements under the Act. The accused was clearly informed by ACRA that “\[t\]_here is no distinction between an “active” and “non-active” director._”[^41] This position was reiterated by the representative of ACRA[^42] who testified during cross-examination as follows:

QWitness, just a few more areas, if you bear with me. Do you agree that the Companies Act does not prohibit the appointment of nominee directors?

AI will say that the Companies Act does not differentiate between nominee or active directors.[^43]

32     In other words, the correct legal position which I accept, is that the standard of duty that is statutorily imposed on all directors is the same regardless of the labels that the directors may choose to call themselves.

33     It is pointed out by the prosecution, which I accept, that it is Parliament’s intention under the Act to require at least one locally resident director for Singapore registered companies so that at the very least, there is one resident director who may be held accountable for the obligations of the company.[^44] That person would be the accused in respect of the companies stated in the charges.

34     The rationale of this legal position was explained by the High Court in _Abdul Ghani bin Tahir v PP_ (‘_Abdul Ghani’_), a case that is relied on by both parties in their respective submissions. In _Abdul Ghani_, the court examined the role of non-executive but locally resident directors and their duties in respect of commercial decisions that were made by foreign executive directors. In examining the role of non-executive directors, Chan Seng Onn J. stated at \[89\] that while local resident directors might not be liable for breach of their duties in connection with _commercial_ decisions made by the company (emphasis original), however, local resident directors:

cannot simply be a “dummy director” who approves, ignores or is nonchalant as to whether the company is engaging in any illegal activities. If it were otherwise, it would make an utter mockery out of the statutory requirement to have a local resident director because all a foreign company needs to do to circumvent any external supervision is to employ a dummy resident director and pay him enough money to keep his mouth sealed in order for the corporate shield of the company to be used for nefarious or illegal purposes.

35     I take guidance from the above cited Parliamentary intention and judicial pronouncements. While the accused may not be responsible for commercial decisions of the company, he is certainly to be held accountable and liable for the non-commercial statutory obligations of the company under the Act. I find that it did not make a difference that the accused in this case was merely a nominee director. The standard of duty imposed on a CSP such as the accused is the same as the other directors of the company, resident or otherwise. The accused cannot hide behind the self-proclaimed label of a nominee director and play dumb. On the contrary, it may well be argued that since the accused was an CSP, the companies’ statutory obligations to hold AGMs and file ARs would come squarely within the accused’s remit and domain of expertise.

### Knowingly and wilfully permit breach

36     It is submitted by the prosecution that the accused had the authority under the memorandum and articles of association (‘M&A’) of the respective companies to give the requisite notice and call an AGM as a director.[^45] At the very least, the accused accepted that there is nothing under the M&A that would prevent him from holding an AGM or filing an AR.[^46]

37     As to what the requisite _mens rea_ of “knowingly and wilfully permitting” a breach entails, the prosecution referred to a number of cases in their submission. Suffice to say that I find the decision by Chan Sek Kiong JC as he then was in _Swee Leong Cheng v Project Aqua Culture & Trading Co Pte Ltd_ (‘_Swee Leong Cheng’_) to be most relevant and instructive. In _Swee Leong Cheng_, there was an application by a director to claim relief from the court under s 391 of the Act in respect of his responsibility for his company’s default in holding the AGM and lodging of the AR. The High Court adopted the meaning of the phrase “knowingly and wilfully” that was provided by Burt J. of the Western Australian Supreme Court in _Manning v Cory_ (1974) CLC 40 as follows:

I recognise the difficulty in applying the words “knowingly and wilfully…authorises or permits an offence” to a case in which the offence is one of omission – a failure to do something which the law requires to be done. I would have thought however that these words require that the prosecution to establish a case to answer must lead evidence upon which, if accepted, **_it could be held that the accused knew the thing not done was not done and in the free exercise of his will authorized or permitted the non-doing of it_** but I cannot accept the view that in addition the prosecution must call evidence upon which it could be found that the accused knew there was a law in force which made the failure to do the act unlawfully. See generally _Iannella v French_ (1967) 119 CLR at p. 84

(emphasis added)

38     I am guided by the observations in _Swee Leong Cheng_ and I agree with the prosecution’s submission that an accused is said to “knowingly and wilfully permit” a breach if he has knowledge of the breach and by the “free exercise” of his will authorised or permitted the breach to take place.[^47] I do not believe that the defence seriously disputes this meaning as ascribed in _Swee Leong Cheng_.

39     For completeness, I do not think that the other cases cited by the prosecution adds anything further to the meaning of the phrase, except that in another Australian decision in _Crichton v Montgomery_ (1963) 2 ACLR 89 (‘_Crichton’_), the Supreme Court of Victoria cautioned that the motive for not doing something must not be confused with the intention of not doing that thing. In _Crichton_, two directors appealed against their convictions for offences of failing to hold AGMs and file ARs in that they had knowingly and wilfully permitted the commission of the company’s breaches. The relevant Australian statutory provisions in respect of the offences are similar to the provisions in the Act. The appellant directors argued that they could not hold the AGM or file the AR because they had been advised by the assistant managing director (whose advice turned out to be wrong) that the accounts were not complete. In dismissing their argument and upholding their convictions, the Australian court held that the fact of the assistant managing director persuading them not to hold the AGM was the motive and did not negative the wilfulness on the part of the directors in not holding the AGM. The directors clearly had the intention not to hold the AGM and the best of motives (even misguided ones) will not excuse an act that is prohibited by the law. The Australian court added that[^48]:

Even though the defendants may not have desired to avoid the holding of the annual general meeting, they nevertheless decided to authorize or permit the company not to hold it and manifested this decision by their conduct.

40     Following the reasoning in _Crichton_ and applying it to the present facts, I hold that it is not a defence for the accused in the present case to assert that he did not desire to avoid the holding of the AGMs or file the ARs. His proffered reason for allowing the statutory breaches was that the foreign directors and shareholders were non-contactable or did not provide necessary accounting records to prepare the accounts and other information to hold the AGM and lodge the AR. I find that these are but excuses which constitute the motive for not holding the AGMs or filing the ARs. Ultimately, the inescapable intention of the accused is to allow the state of affairs to continue thus resulting in the companies breaching the requirements under the Act. Due to his inaction, he allowed the breaches to snowball. Regardless of the accused’s motive, and by his conduct, he had committed the offences as charged. While his motive may be relevant as a mitigating (or aggravating) factor in sentencing, that motive is irrelevant to the issue of liability in respect of the charges.

### Defence rejected

#### Accused not without options

41     The nub of the defence is that the accused could not hold the requisite AGMs or file the ARs because he could not contact the foreign directors or get them to cooperate to provide him with the necessary written and signed instructions/documents and accounts to comply with the requirements under the Act.[^49] Therefore, apart from reminding and chasing the foreign directors (by way of letters, emails and phone calls) to provide the necessary documents and accounts to hold the AGM and file the AR, he claimed that there was nothing else that he could have done. This claim and defence is plainly incorrect and I reject this defence.

42     I note that the offences span a period of many years from 2011 to 2017. As highlighted above, the accused was advised as early as 2012 that he had a number of options and recourses available to him if he faced difficulties in holding the AGM or filing the AR. These options are comprehensively set out by the prosecution in their submission.[^50] I accept and find that these options were available to the accused but he chose not to avail them but was content to merely send reminders to the foreign directors and in the same breath, chase them for outstanding fees owed to him for his CSP services.[^51] I agree with the prosecution’s submission that these options, whether pursued on their own or in combination, may have negated any allegation that the accused knowingly and wilfully permitted the companies to breach the obligations under the Act. In fact, if he had successfully pursued these options, the companies would not have breached their statutory obligations and the charges would not have been levelled at the accused. In any event, I propose to only summarise these options that were available to the accused because as I will point out later, the accused was well aware of most, if not all, of the options. After all, the accused is an experienced CSP having been in the business for close to two decades.

43     One of the hurdles the accused claimed he faced was that he could not contact the foreign directors to form a quorum (of at least two members) to hold any of the AGMs. Even if that is the case, the prosecution pointed out and I accept that the accused was appointed as a proxy to attend and vote at AGMs for at least four of the companies.[^52] If so, the issue of quorum would not have been a hurdle at least for four of the companies.

44     Further, even if quorum was an issue, the accused could have applied to the High Court under s 182 of the Act to overcome this hurdle. This provision generally provides that in situations where it is “_impracticable to call a meeting in any manner in which meetings may be called or to conduct the meeting in the manner prescribed by the articles or this Act_”, the High Court has the discretion to order a meeting (including an AGM) to be held and conducted “_in such manner as the Court thinks fit_,” and the High Court may give ancillary or consequential directions as it thinks expedient, including a direction that only one member or his proxy shall constitute a quorum. In other words, this provision gives the High Court much discretion to order an AGM to be held and conducted even if the usual pre-conditions cannot be met. Therefore, it was open to the accused to make the application to the High Court to give directions as to the necessary quorum. As pointed out by the prosecution, in the case of _Lim Yew Meng v Aik Chuan Construction Pte Ltd_ at \[30\], the High Court opined that an inability to form a quorum because some members refused to attend the meeting would be an example of the impracticability of convening a meeting as envisaged under s 182 of the Act.

45     In fact, the scope of s 182 of the Act with regards to the holding of a meeting is so wide that the accused could have applied to the High Court for the necessary directions that would have been expedient to overcome any of the difficulties that he claimed to face in calling for an AGM for his companies.

46     The accused also claimed that he could not hold an AGM because he could not obtain from the foreign directors the full set of accounts to be laid at the meeting.[^53] I agree with the prosecution’s submission that under s 201(1) of the Act, the directors are only required to lay the company’s accounts at the AGM. There is no statutory requirement that these accounts must be complete and approved at the AGM.[^54] As such, there is no legal impediment to the accused holding an AGM even if he did not have the full set of the company’s accounts or financial statements. Therefore, I accept prosecution’s position that the AGMs could have been called without the completed accounts being laid.

47     Yet another option was pointed out by the prosecution in that the accused could also have applied to the High Court under s 409A of the Act to compel the foreign directors to hold an AGM or at least to co-operate by providing the necessary accounting records and documents to the accused. The accused did not pursue this option.

48     Next, the accused claimed that since he cannot hold the AGM, he could not therefore file the ARs, quite apart from the fact that he did not have the complete accounts to file the AR in the first place. In this regard, I agree with the prosecution’s position that the accused cannot rely on his first default (in not holding the AGM) as a reason to excuse the subsequent default of not filing the AR. This principle is gleaned from the English cases of _Gibson v Barton_ (1875) LR 10 QB 329, _Edmunds v Foster_ (1875) 33 LTNS 690 and _Park v Lawton_ \[1911\] 1 KK 588 that were cited by the prosecution where it was held that an officer of a company cannot answer a charge of failing to lodge an AR by saying that the AGM was not held, if the officer himself was a party to the default of not holding the meeting in the first place.

49     Further, it is submitted by the prosecution which I agree that the accused is not stopped from obtaining the companies’ accounts and financial statements himself, even if the foreign directors are uncooperative or unresponsive. Thus, if the foreign directors refuse to or do not otherwise provide the accounts or the necessary records for the accused to prepare the accounts, he can make an application under s 399 of the Act for the High Court to allow him to inspect the company’s accounting records. Such accounting records are required under s 199 of the Act to be kept by the company in Singapore in such manner as to enable the records to be conveniently and properly audited. Further, if such accounting and other records are kept outside of Singapore, these records shall be sent to and kept in Singapore and be at all times open to inspection by the directors, which would include the accused. If such records are not sent to Singapore, the accused may again apply to the High Court under s 399 of the Act for an order to compel the foreign directors to send and keep the records in Singapore and be made available for the accused’s inspection.

50     In addition, the terms of the NSAs signed with the companies also require the foreign directors to render quarterly or monthly accounts and to advise ACS/the nominee director of the name and address of the company’s book-keeper or accountant, and if no such appointment is made, ACS/the nominee director has the right to undertake these duties and charge the appropriate fees.[^55] I will elaborate more on the terms of the NSAs further on in these grounds. Suffice it to say at this point that therefore, given all these avenues, the accused has no reason why he cannot obtain the accounting records and file the ARs on behalf of the company.

51     The accused also claimed that some of these companies are effectively dormant.[^56] If so, as highlighted above, the accused was advised by ACRA as early as 2012 to take steps to remove the company’s name from ACRA’s register. The accused was keenly aware of this option but chose not to do so and allowed the unsatisfactory state of dormancy to continue leading to the multiple breaches by the companies. As may be seen in many of his correspondence with the foreign directors of the various companies, the accused did threaten to strike off the company. For example, in respect of the company Oliver Wight Asia Pacific (S) Pte Ltd (‘Oliver Wight Asia Pacific’), he wrote to the foreign director as far back as July 2013 threatening to apply for striking off because the accused has not been able to contact the said foreign director.[^57] However, the accused did not do so even up to August 2017 and February 2018 when he wrote to the foreign director repeating the same admonition of striking off.[^58]

52     In fact, in respect of Oliver Wight Asia Pacific (and other companies), the accused had yet another option i.e. to wind up the company under s 254(1) of the Act. I note from the defence documentary exhibits (and this is also pointed out by the prosecution) that the accused sought legal advice because the foreign director allegedly misused company funds and also that the company owed ACS $15,000 in CSP fees. In an email dated 24 May 2011, his lawyers advised the accused that he can apply to wind up the company.[^59] His lawyers also advised that the advantage of winding up the company was that the accused’s duties as a director will then cease after the company is wound up. However, the accused did not go ahead with this course of action because presumably, he was not prepared to pay the legal costs of about $12,000 to wind up the company as estimated by his lawyers.

53     There are numerous other correspondence in respect of other companies where the accused threatened to either wind up the company because it owed the accused fees or to strike off the company because the foreign directors were not responding.[^60] I also note that in his correspondence with one of the companies (Rothesay Pte Ltd)[^61], he in fact advised the company of two ways to close down the company i.e. (i) members voluntary winding-up or (ii) striking off. He then offered to provide the service to strike off the company for a fee of US$2,000. He similarly advised Gannon Power Pte Ltd that to liquidate the company would cost S$10,000 and to strike it off would cost S$2,500.[^62]

54     I therefore find that the accused was fully aware of the recourses and options available but did not pursue them. Instead, he subjugated his duty as a director of these companies to his own pecuniary interests as a CSP to the said companies. He chose not to wind up, strike off or deregister the companies simply because he was not paid his CSP fees and to do so would incur additional business costs to him. He was content to wait out, for as long as it took, until his fees were paid or until the foreign directors responded in one way or another. In so doing, the breaches snowballed.

#### Nominee service agreements (NSAs)

55     The accused claimed that he did not apply to strike off the companies because of his fiduciary duty to the company and his contractual obligations.[^63] I cannot accept this claim. On the contrary, I find that he ought to have taken appropriate steps to strike off or dissolve the companies one way or another because of his duty as a director and his contractual obligations.

56     The accused acknowledged his statutory duties as a director and agreed in his evidence that the NSAs do not override his director duties:

Q…Now, therefore, I put it to you that the terms of the nominee agreements in which you have been appointed as a nominee cannot displace the statutory duties you have as a director.

AYes.

QAnd you act as a director with all the obligations to exercise reasonable diligence in the discharge of your duties including ensuring the company complies with the regulatory requirements of the Act, including Section 175 and 197.

AYes.[^64]

57     I find that the contracts or NSAs[^65] signed by ACS with the companies to appoint the accused as a nominee director do not prevent the accused from either discharging his duties as a director generally or from striking out or winding up the company specifically. In fact, the clauses are drafted in such a way as to protect ACS/the nominee director in the precise circumstances which the accused found himself (which circumstances he is relying on) in respect of the companies i.e. that the foreigners cannot be contacted or are uncooperative or that the companies are dormant.

58     The NSAs are materially similar in their scope and content. Let me take the first NSA exhibited in the defence bundle in respect of the company Gannon Power Pte Ltd as an example.[^66] The clauses under the said NSA stipulate the duties, responsibilities and powers of the contracting parties, including the accused as a nominee director. I highlight the clauses relevant to the accused as a nominee director. Not only do the following clauses not impede the accused from carrying his duties as a director of the company, they in fact mandate and empower the nominee to act in the interests of the company:

a.     Clause 2.1 states that the nominee shall “_exercise all functions required by the articles of association of the Company while observing to the best of his ability the interests of the Company.”_

As already noted above, the accused accepted in his evidence that the NSAs do not displace his statutory duties as a director and that he is bound to act reasonably and with due diligence in the interests of his company.

b.     Clause 2.2 requires and empowers the nominee to sign routine notices, minutes, resolutions and returns of the Company and all statutory documents as director of the company.

The accused is expressly authorised to sign (both in his personal capacity and also as a proxy) all documents for the company. Therefore, he simply cannot use the excuse that he is unable to contact the foreign directors or get them to sign the necessary company documents, including notices for AGMs.

c.     Clause 2.3 even provides that ACS may appoint an alternate director to one of the foreign directors who shall act on the instructions of the nominee, in the event that the nominee does not receive timely instructions “_despite efforts made by the Nominee to obtain such instructions as provided under clause 4.3_”.

This clause specifically provides for the claimed situation that the accused relies on in his defence to all the charges. As such, even in a situation where the accused is not able to contact a foreign director or where such director does not give timely instructions, the accused is authorised to appoint an alternate director who will effectively replace the absent/uncooperative foreign director.

d.     Clause 4.3 in turn provides that the nominee has the authority to “_make such decisions as it deems fit, including winding-up or de-registering the Company_” in the event that the nominee is unable to contact the Principal and/or the shareholders of the Company for instructions or if instructions have not been given for more than six months.

Thus, pursuant to this clause, the accused may take such course of action as he deems necessary, including winding up or de-registering the company, if he does not receive instructions for more than six months. Therefore, in respect of the present charges, there is no reason or justification for the accused to wait years on end for the foreign directors to respond or cooperate. As rightly and accurately put to the accused by the learned DPP, the accused simply “stood by and let the company default in its obligation to hold the AGM and file the annual return in respect of all the charges.”[^67]

59     In light of these clauses that I have highlighted, the accused has absolutely no excuse or defence whatsoever that he is powerless and option-less simply because he is unable to contact the foreign directors or that these foreign directors were uncooperative. In truth, I find that he did knowingly and wilfully permitted the companies to default in their statutory obligations.

#### No due diligence

60     I agree with the prosecution’s submission[^68] that the defence has mischaracterised the testimony of the representative from ACRA[^69] who gave evidence for the prosecution. During cross-examination, counsel was trying to get the witness to agree with the defence that the accused did not have any options and therefore, that the accused had tried his level best. However, it is plain from the witness’ testimony that ultimately, his position is that the accused has not discharged his duties as a director with due diligence:

QIf the---what is the purpose of paragraph 17 of your PS1? Why do you say it in your Conditioned Statement? How is it relevant to us?

AHe did not, uh, take all due diligence in terms of trying to comply with 175 and 197.[^70]

61     It was also unfair of counsel to ask the ACRA representative, a lay witness, questions concerning possible applications to the High Court:

QI put it to you that none of the various routes suggested in PS1 were practical or reasonable for him to have taken in the circumstances, bearing in mind your previous evidence.

AHe still has not made an application to the High Court.

QYou agree that even if he had made an application to the High Court, if the accounts could not be prepared, then annual returns could not have been filed? Even if he applied to the High Court.

AWell, I can’t say for sure what the High Court would have ordered in terms of the---well, the---the how should I put it? Putting up the necessary accounts for filing.[^71]

The witness would not have the legal expertise to answer such questions. In any case, it remains a fact that the accused did not made any such applications to the High Court.

62     Counsel’s made a litany of suggestions to ACRA’s representative that the accused could not have reasonably pursued a number of options. However, I had made it very clear to counsel during the trial (as the notes of proceedings will show) that in my view, it is ultimately for the court (and not the prosecution witness) to decide whether the accused had indeed acted reasonably or had discharged his duties as a director with due diligence. I find that the accused has not done so.

63     The least he could have done was to ask for extensions of time to comply with s 175 and s 197 of the Act at the early stages but it is not in dispute that he did not do so. He is well aware of the option of seeking an extension of time as evident from the many reminders sent to the foreign directors as well as ACRA’s reminders to ACS.[^72] In this regard, the accused was overly pedantic and therefore unbelievable in his claim that while he was aware that he could apply for an extension of time, he did not know that he could have applied for a _further_ extension of time. I find that these are mere excuses to justify his ‘pen-pushing’ exercise of sending reminders to the foreign directors. In any case, he did not make any attempt to apply for an extension of time to comply with the statutory obligations which form the subject-matter of the charges.

64     The defence also tried to justify its position by claiming that any extension of time would have been impractical as there was no prospect of holding an AGM in so short a time-frame.[^73] However, I find that if indeed there was no prospect of holding an AGM, it would only be due to the fact that the accused has failed to take any active or remedial steps (apart from sending useless reminders to the foreign directors) to convene or compel an AGM to be convened. In failing to even apply for an appropriate extension of time right from the start to take the necessary steps to comply with the statutory requirements, the accused cannot be said to have discharged his duties with any degree of diligence.

### Conclusion

65     In conclusion, I find that the accused knowingly and wilfully permitted the companies to breach the statutory requirements under the Act by failing to hold the AGMs and lodge the ARs. I find that he had the duty, both under the Act and the NSAs, to ensure that the companies comply with the statutory requirements but failed to do so without good reason or justification. Further, I find that he had the authority to dissolve or wind-up the companies if he is unable to obtain instructions at all or within reasonable time from the foreign directors or if the companies have become dormant.

66     I reject his defence that he had no options because the directors could not be contacted or were uncooperative.

67     I am satisfied and I find that the prosecution has proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused is convicted on all the charges.

68     As noted at the outset of these grounds, the accused has paid the fines imposed on him in full and is appealing only against the order of conviction.
