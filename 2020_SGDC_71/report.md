> l.     Thava Kumuran S/O Ramamutty, male, aged 35 years old (DOB: 27 September 1984, a Singapore Citizen (“Thava”).

7       The victims are: -

> a.     Sikder Sujan, a 45-year-old Bangladeshi national (“A1”);

> b.     Soleman Alam, a 51-year old Bangladeshi national (“A2”);

> c.     Alamgir Md, a 48-year old Bangladeshi national (“A3”); and

> d.     Rana Salim, a 44-year old Bangladeshi national (“A4”).

8       On 11 December 2017, at about 3.06am, A1 called the police, stating “4 PERSONS TOOK SINGAPORE MONEY FROM MY FRIEND AND GO ALREADY. TODAY SUNDAY MY FRIEND COLLECT MONEY”. The incident location was reported to be the second storey of 93A Rowell Road, Singapore.

##### Facts relating to the offence committed

9       Investigations revealed that on 10 December 2017, A1 and A3 had collected money from various Bangladeshi nationals, with the intention of handing the collected monies to A2, who was in Singapore on a business trip. A2 would then bring the collected monies back to Bangladesh at a commission. On 10 December 2017, sometime around midnight, A1 and A3 were inside their place of residence at Room 4 of 93A Rowell Road. Subsequently, A2 and A4 (_ie_, A2’s friend who was also in Singapore as a tourist) joined them inside Room 4, which is on the second floor.

10     On 11 December 2017, at about 2.55am, Shanker drove a silver Volvo bearing a deregistered licence plate no. SCN 2256J and fetched Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava to 93A Rowell Road. While Shanker remained in the car, the rest alighted.

11     In furtherance of the common intention of Shanker, Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava to commit an offence of gang-robbery, Thava opened the locked front door of 93A Rowell Road. Thereafter, Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava entered the unit and arrived at Room 4.

12     Ridzuan and Thava stood inside Room 4, while Juraimi and Azril stood outside Room 4 at the door. Thava identified Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and himself as officers from the Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”), and asked to check the victims’ identification documents. Each of the victims handed over their identification documents for inspection and felt afraid. At the material time, they did not dare to leave Room 4, as they thought that the four accused persons were CID officers and the four accused persons had wrongfully restrained the victims by preventing them from leaving Room 4.

13     Thava then directed two of the victims to go downstairs. At or around 3am, Azril led A3 and A4 downstairs, and Juraimi followed suit. Downstairs, Juraimi and Azril directed A3 and A4 to stand along the corridor and not to move. A3 and A4 complied with their directions. Juraimi and Azril stood in front of A3 and A4, wrongfully restraining A3 and A4 by preventing them from moving and escaping. Juraimi and Azril also did not allow A3 and A4 to look up at their faces.

14     Concurrently, Ridzuan and Thava remained inside Room 4 with A1 and A2. Ridzuan and Thava were standing in front of the door wrongfully restraining A1 and A2 by preventing them from leaving the room. A1 and A2 also felt afraid as they had been told that the accused persons were CID officers and did not dare to leave the room. Thava searched the room, and took one white paper bag containing cash amounting to S$290,000 from a cupboard and cash amounting to S$10,000 from one of the drawers, out of the possession of A1 and A2, without their consent. Thava then handed the items to Ridzuan. Ridzuan and Thava then escorted A1 and A2 downstairs.

15     Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava exited the unit, boarded the silver Volvo motor car which was driven by Shanker and left the scene. The four victims realised that Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava were not CID officers, and called the Police.

##### Initial investigations leading to the arrest of the accused persons

16     Through reviewing CCTV footage recorded in the vicinity of the incident location, the Police discovered that a silver Volvo motor car had driven past Serangoon Road and Rangoon Road, at or around the time of the incident. After reviewing CCTV footage from a private unit along Rangoon Road, the Police discovered that one black Peugeot motor car and one silver Volvo motor car had entered into the open space car park along Rangoon Lane, on 11 December 2017 at about 1am. The silver Volvo motor car, which bore a deregistered licence plate no. SCN 2256J, was later seen leaving the said car park at about 2.51am and returning at about 3.06am. At about 10.06pm, a similar-looking silver Volvo motor car bearing a licence plate no. SLM9630L was seen leaving the said car park.

17     Further investigations revealed that the registered owner for the vehicle bearing licence plate no. SLM 9630L was one Ong Wee Teng (“Ong”). Upon being interviewed on 14 December 2017, Ong stated that he had rented his silver Volvo motor car bearing licence plate no. SLM 9630L to one “Valerie” on the day of the incident. This was later established to be the first co-accused, Valerie.

##### Events leading up to the commission of the offence on 11 December 2017

18     Investigations revealed that about one month prior to 10 December 2017, Thava came to know of the victims’ illegal remittance business and informed Shanker and Juraimi about it. Thereafter, Shanker, Juraimi and Thava discussed how they were going to take the money from the victims.

19     About one week prior to 10 December, Shanker called Juraimi and requested that Juraimi meet Shanker and Thava at a coffee shop. At the material time, Juraimi was with Azril and Ridzuan. As such, all five of them (Shanker, Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava) met up to discuss how they were going to take the money from the victims. During the discussion, it was agreed that Shanker and Thava would make all the arrangements including procuring a car. Shanker and Thava instructed the rest to be ready whenever they call.

20     Sometime on 10 December 2017, Shanker called Safit and informed him to recruit people to act as look-outs for that night. The look-outs were supposed to look out for police presence in the vicinity of Rowell Road. Shanker also asked Safit to rent a vehicle for him, and Safit agreed to do so.

21     On the same day, Safit called Ashraf and Hafiz on the phone separately, and offered them a “kacui” job (which means jobs to act as look-outs for Police presence) for the night. Safit informed them that they would be helping Shanker, and also told them to meet at the ‘L K Maju’ Restaurant’ at 51 Rowell Road, Singapore (“the Restaurant”) sometime at around midnight. Ashraf and Hafiz accepted the “kacui” job.

22     While Safit was at Shanker’s residence in Jalan Pintau, together with Udaya, Safit informed Udaya to ask Valerie to rent a vehicle and leave it at the open space car park at Rangoon Lane (“the Car Park”). Safit also pointed to a plastic bag containing two false licence plates, and instructed Udaya to paste the false licence plates on the rented vehicle. Safit informed Udaya to leave at least four pairs of gloves inside the rented vehicle. Udaya agreed to do so. On 11 December 2017, sometime past midnight, Valerie and Udaya left a rented vehicle, namely a silver Volvo bearing registration no. SLM 9630 L, with false licence plates attached and five pairs of gloves inside, at the Car Park. The key to the silver Volvo was left under one of its tyres.

23     Sometime on 11 December 2017, Mareish met up with Hafiz before heading to the Restaurant. Later that day, Safit and Ashraf separately arrived at the Restaurant. Safit decided to include Mareish in the “kacui” job as well as Mareish was friends with Hafiz. Mareish agreed to the “kacui” job.

24     Safit then began delegating roles for the “kacui” job to Ashraf, Hafiz and Mareish. Ashraf and Hafiz were tasked to station themselves at the Neighbourhood Police Centre along the end of the road, while Mareish was to station himself at the Restaurant. They were each tasked to look out for traffic and Police presence by Safit.

25     Subsequently, on 11 December 2017 sometime after 1.56am, Valerie and Udaya arrived at the Restaurant in a black Peugeot, which was being driven by Valerie (“the black Peugeot”). Safit then instructed Udaya to wait at the Restaurant to act as a lookout together with Mareish. Safit boarded the black Peugeot, which was being driven by Valerie, and told Valerie to drive to Veerasamy Road. At Veerasamy Road, Valerie and Safit remained inside the black Peugeot to look out for Police presence.

26     Once Valerie, Udaya, Ashraf, Hafiz and Mareish were in their positions, Safit called Shanker to update him that everyone was in position.

27     Sometime on 11 December 2017, Juraimi was instructed to go to Rangoon Road. Accordingly, Juraimi proceeded to Rangoon Road and met up with Azril. Sometime later, Shanker called Azril to inform him that Shanker was on the way to fetch them. Shortly after, Shanker and Thava arrived at Rangoon Road in a car, where they picked up Juraimi, Azril and Ridzuan (who arrived subsequently).

28     Together with the four accused persons, Shanker drove the car to the Car Park. Upon reaching, all five accused persons boarded the silver Volvo and Shanker drove to 93A Rowell Road. Shanker remained in the silver Volvo while Thava opened the locked door of the unit and the remaining four accused persons entered the unit.

29     In the morning of 11 December 2017, Shanker called Safit multiple times to ask about the traffic conditions and Police presence in the roads in the vicinity. Safit, who was aware that Shanker had engaged Noorul to ride around on his motorcycle to act as a look-out during that same night, also facilitated communication between Shanker and Noorul. Noorul would report his observations to Safit, who would then communicate this to Shanker.

30     When Juraimi, Azril, Ridzuan and Thava exited 93A Rowell Road, they boarded the silver Volvo which Shanker was driving and left for the Car Park. Upon arrival, they boarded the original car which Shanker drove and drove off.

31     Sometime after 3.06am, Shanker called Safit, stating that everyone could stand down. Safit then instructed Valerie to drive back to the Restaurant. They picked up Ashraf and Hafiz along the way, and also picked up Udaya and Mareish at the Restaurant. Thereafter, they dropped Ashraf, Hafiz and Mareish somewhere closer to the main road, for them to hail a cab.

32     Later, Shanker called Safit again, directing him to go to the Car Park where the silver Volvo was parked. Shanker instructed Safit to clean the car and informed Safit that he had left the key to the car under one of its tyres. Valerie, Udaya and Safit then proceeded to the Car Park, where the silver Volvo had been left. At the Car Park, the silver Volvo was parked in the same spot that it was left in. Udaya removed the false licence plates from the silver Volvo, and placed the false licence plates inside the black Peugeot. Safit wiped down the interior and the exterior of the silver Volvo and picked up the key to the silver Volvo from under one of its tyres.

33     At around 3.45am, Valerie, Udaya and Safit left the silver Volvo in the Car Park, and drove off from the Car Park in the black Peugeot. Valerie dropped Udaya and Safit off at Shanker’s residence in Jalan Pintau. Valerie then returned to her place of residence at Blk 682D Woodlands Drive 73 #XXX, Singapore, where she threw the false licence plates into the rubbish chute.

34     Sometime on 11 December 2017, Shanker left cash of S$5,000 in front of his residence at Jalan Pintau and instructed Safit to distribute the money to the other accused persons whom Safit had engaged as look-outs. Shanker also paid Juraimi, Azril and Ridzuan money for their involvement in the offence. For his involvement, Azril received S$5,000. This amount was not recovered and no restitution has been made.

35     In order to apprehend the various co-accused persons, the Police conducted several island-wide operations between 15 December 2017 and 8 January 2018. The operations involved the deployments of large numbers of police officers. As a result, all the accused persons (except for Shanker and Thava) were arrested:

> a.     Valerie was arrested on 15 December 2017;

> b.     Safit was arrested on 16 December 2017;

> c.     Hafiz was arrested on 19 December 2017;

> d.     Mareish was arrested on 21 December 2017

> e.     Ashraf was arrested on 22 December 2017;

> f.     Noorul was arrested on 25 December 2017;

> g.     Udaya was arrested on 31 December 2017;

> h.     Juraimi was arrested on 8 January 2018;

> i.     Azril was arrested on 8 January 2018;

> j.     Ridzuan was arrested on 8 January 2018.

36     Shanker and Thava, who fled Singapore shortly after the incident, were arrested in Malaysia on 14 April 2018 and brought back to Singapore.

37     Only S$5,500 of the S$300,000 taken from A1 and A2 was recovered.

38     By virtue of the foregoing, Azril has committed an offence of gang-robbery together with Shanker, Juraimi, Ridzuan and Thava, which is an offence under Section 391 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), punishable under Section 395 of the Penal Code.

### FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 4TH CHARGE (DAC-928832-2019), 7TH CHARGE (DAC-928835-2018) and 8TH CHARGE (DAC-928836-2018)

39     The accused persons are:

> a.     Fahmi Bin Abdul Razak (“Fahmi”), male, aged 38 year old (DOB: 20 October 1981), a Singapore citizen;

> b.     Muhammad Taufiq Bin Mohamed Haniffa (“Taufiq”), who is also known as “Tino”;

> c.     Muhammad Ridzuan Bin Mohammad Yusof (“Ridzuan”), who is also known as “Wan Black”;

> d.     Muhammad Farid Bin Abu (“Farid”), who is also known as “Fred”;

> e.     Azril, who is also known as “Baby”;

> f.     Nor Mohamad Azhairi Bin Sajali (“Azhairi”), who is also known as “M”;

> g.     Mohammed Faheez Bin Abdul Hamid (“Faheez”); and

> h.     Irsyad Sameer Bin Abdul Rahim (“Irsyad”), who is also known as “Boy Syad”.

40     The accused persons, except Azhairi, are members of the same secret society, which is the “Omega” Secret Society of the “Independent” Group (“Omega”). Azhairi is aware that the other accused persons are from Omega.

41     The other involved parties are:

> a.     Johari Bin Sharif (“Johari”), who is also known as “Chubby”;

> b.     Muhammad Khairulanwar Bin Mohamed Sani (“the first deceased”), who is also known as “Starboy”; and

> c.     Nurul Filzah Syazwani Binte Abdul Rahim (“the second deceased”).

42     Investigations revealed that Johari, a senior member of the “Sio Kun Tong” Secret Society of the “18” Group that operated at Blk 143 Teck Whye Lane (“Teck Whye Lane”), had a dispute with one Danni Iskandar Bin Ahmad (“Danni”). Danni was also a member of Omega. Soon, other members of Omega, including, Taufiq also became involved in Danni’s dispute with Johari.

##### Events inside the Club

43     On 16 December 2017, Johari was at Club Baliza located at 6 Raffles Boulevard #01-04 (“the Club”) with the two deceased persons and several others. The accused persons were also in the same club.

44     While Johari was inside the club, he was approached by Azril who asked him whether he had any problems with his “brother”. With the intention to cause hurt to Johari, Azril then punched Johari in the face. After Johari was punched, some of the accused persons approached Johari. However, they were stopped by the Club’s security staff from assaulting Johari.

45     By punching Johari in the face, Azril has committed an offence under Section 323 of the Penal Code. This forms the subject of the fourth charge against Azril, namely DAC-928832-2018.

##### Events outside the Club

46     Soon after Azril punched Johari, the security staff escorted the accused persons’ group out of the Club. While outside the Club, sometime before 5.50am on the same day, one or more of the accused persons, shouted aggressively and called out to Johari for a fight. They were preparing to attack Johari should he exit the Club.

47     The accused persons dispersed when Police officers arrived at the scene.

##### Events outside 7-11

48     At about 5.50am on the same day, the accused persons congregated at the driveway in front of Marina Square, 6 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore, outside a 7-11 store. They were chit-chatting amongst themselves when they spotted a white car that they suspected contained members of Teck Whye Lane (i.e. the secret society that Johari belonged to).

49     They then approached the white car, which had stopped at the end of the driveway. Irsyad, Ridzuan, Azril, Azhairi, Taufiq and Faheez surrounded the car. Azhairi was armed with a baseball bat at the material time. One or more of them tried to open the car doors and also hit and kicked the car, demanding that the occupants alight. This included Irsyad, who punched the side mirror of the car and Azril, who punched and kicked the car. The white car subsequently drove off. None of its occupants alighted. The incident was captured by CCTV.

50     Azril and the co-accused persons (Irsyad, Ridzuan, Azhairi, Taufiq and Faheez) shared a common object to voluntarily cause hurt to the occupants in the white car, whom they suspected to be members of “Teck Whye Lane”. By kicking and punching the car, one or more members of the group, had also used violence in the furtherance of the said common object. All of them, including Azril, was aware that Azhairi was armed with a baseball bat at the material time, which used a weapon of offence is likely to cause death and they have each committed an offence under Section 148 read with Sections 146 and 149 of the Penal Code. This forms the subject of the seventh charge against Azril, namely DAC-928835-2018.

##### Events leading to the death of the first and second accused

51     After the white car drove off, the accused persons returned to their respective vehicles and left in search of the white car and other members of “Teck Whye Lane”. They drove around Marina Square in a convoy of cars. Fahmi got into a car driven by Taufiq.

52     Meanwhile, Johari and the two deceased persons were escorted out of the Club by the security officers. They went to the Marina Square car park and boarded the first deceased’s motor car bearing registration number SLB 1038H, a Silver Honda Civic (“the Silver Honda”).

53     The first deceased, who was driving the Silver Honda, then proceeded to Raffles Boulevard in the Silver Honda to pick up a friend. Three cars (driven by Taufiq, Ridzuan and Irsyad) which contained the accused persons then surrounded the Silver Honda at Raffles Boulevard.

54     The car driven by Irsyad, bearing registration number SJE 4666H, stopped in front of the Silver Honda, while the other two cars stopped at the side and at the rear, thereby surrounding the Silver Honda. Faheez stopped his car behind the other cars. Azril, who was in the car driven by Irsyad, also came out and kicked the door of the Silver Honda.

55     The first deceased was able to manoeuvre the Silver Honda through a gap between the cars and managed to flee from the scene. The convoy of cars containing the accused persons then gave chase. They chased the Silver Honda from Marina Square down to Rochor Road and subsequently to Bukit Timah Road. They did so because they knew that Johari was inside the Silver Honda. The conduct of the accused persons placed the occupants of the Silver Honda in a state of panic.

56     The first deceased then drove into Cavenagh Road. While along the road, Johari spotted uniformed Police officers and told the first deceased to turn in to seek help. The first deceased, who had consumed alcohol shortly before, then turned abruptly, causing the Silver Honda to crash into the gate of the rear of the Istana at 6.06am on the same day. The first and second deceased sustained serious injuries and subsequently passed away. Johari sustained a right orbital fracture, right fifth rib fracture with lung contusion, facial lacerations and nasal septal fractures.

57     The incident outside Raffles Boulevard and part of the car-chase was captured by LTA cameras.

58     Azril shared a common object with the co-accused persons to voluntarily cause hurt to Johari, and one or more of them had used violence in furtherance of the said common object by kicking the Silver Honda. He has thereby committed an offence under Section 147 of the Penal Code. This forms the subject of the eighth charge against Azril, namely DAC-928836-2018.

59     Azril was arrested by the Secret Societies Branch on 8 January 2018 and released on bail subsequently.

### FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 5TH CHARGE (DAC-928833-2018)

60     Investigations further revealed that between 2007 and 2010, Azril was a “Fighter” of the “Sio Kun Tong” secret society of the “18” Group. Between January 2011 and July 2011, Azril joined the Omega Secret Society of “Independent” group operating at Blk 257 Bangkit Road and was a “Fighter”. He was subsequently imprisoned for drug trafficking in May 2013.

61     After his release from prison, Azril met Taufiq in a club and got to know that Taufiq was a “Senior Member” of the Omega Secret Society of “Independent” group operating at Cineleisure. Taufiq offered Azril a place in the secret society and Azril agreed to join the secret society in August 2017. He was appointed as “Senior Member” of the secret society on account of his “experience” and previous affiliation with the “Omega” secret society.

62     From August 2017 to 8 January 2018, in Singapore, Azril was a ‘Member’ of an unlawful society, to wit, the ‘Omega’ Secret Society of the ‘Independent’ Group, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 14(3) of the Societies Act (Cap 311, 2014 Rev Ed).

### FACTS PERTAINING TO THE 9TH CHARGE (DAC-902141-2019) and 10TH CHARGE (DAC-902171-2019)

63     The accused persons are:

> a.     Syed Farouk Bin Syed Nasir Aljunied, date of birth: 25 August 1991 (“Farouk”);

> b.     Azril;

> c.     Irsyad Sameer Bin Abdul Rahim, date of birth: 3 February 1991 (“Irsyad”); and

> d.     At least one other unknown subject.

64     The victims are:

> a.     Muhammad bin Abdil Jalil (“Muhammad”), male, aged 24 years old; and

> b.     Ismail Bin AB Jalil (“Ismail”), male, aged 29 years old.

65     On 18 February 2018 at 12.14am, the Police received a ‘999’ call with message stating “THERE ARE PEOPLE CHASING MY HUSBAND WITH PARANG (CALLER CRYING)”. The location of the incident was provided as Blk 626 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 Singapore 560626.

66     Investigation revealed that on the evening of 17 February 2018, Muhammad got into an argument with Farouk over an incident on Facebook that involved Farouk’s brother and Muhammad’s sister-in-law. Muhammad and Farouk subsequently decided to meet at the void deck of Blk 626 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4.

67     At about 12.10 am on 18 February 2018, Muhammad proceeded to the void deck with Ismail and one Muhammad Razif Bin Mohd Amir (“Razif”). When they were at the void deck, Farouk approached them and asked who “Ah Teng” was. Muhammad replied in the affirmative and asked Farouk to talk at a nearby table. Farouk then swung a parang towards Muhammad, Ismail and Razif.

68     As Farouk swung the parang, Irsyad, Azril and at least one other unknown subject joined in the attack and started chasing Muhammad, Ismail and Razif. At least two of the accused persons, including Azril, were also holding on to knives.

69     In the chase, Muhammad was slashed by one of the accused persons with a bladed weapon. As Ismail was running away from the accused persons, Ismail fell and was slashed on the back with the parang by Farouk. When Ismail stood up, Farouk tried to swing the parang towards Ismail’s neck but missed and slashed him on the left shoulder instead. Razif managed to run to safety and did not sustain any injuries.

70     The accused persons fled the scene thereafter. Azril was arrested on 18 February 2018.

71     Azril and the other accused persons, in furtherance of the common intention of them all, did voluntarily cause hurt to Muhammad by means of a bladed weapon, which is an instrument for stabbing or cutting, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 324 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code. This forms the subject of the ninth charge against Azril, namely DAC-902141-2019.

72     Azril did have in his possession an offensive weapon, to wit, one knife, in a public place, otherwise than with lawful authority and lawful purpose, and he has thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 6(1) of the Corrosive Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65, 2013 Rev Ed). This forms the subject of the tenth charge against Azril, namely DAC-902171-2019.

73     Muhammad was seen at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on the same day. He sustained the following injuries:

> a.     6cm superficial linear wound over left lower back – paralumbar region;

> b.     5mm abrasions noted over bilateral dorsal foot; and

> c.     Erythema and tenderness over left wrist ulnar region.

74     Muhammad was given analgesia and his wound was dressed. He was subsequently discharged with prescription and two days of medical leave.

75     Ismail was seen at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on the same day. He sustained the following injuries:

> a.     7cm deep laceration at right lower back with partial lumbar muscle cut;

> b.     T-shape laceration at left shoulder; and

> c.     Open chip fracture left acromion.

76     Ismail was discharged on 19 February 2018. He was given medical leave from 18 February 2018 to 9 March 2018.

78     In addition, the accused has been sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre in 2011 and was placed under a Drug Supervision Order in 2012.

## THE SENTENCE

79     The prosecution, in their written address on sentence, sought a global sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment with 24 strokes of the cane. In the written mitigation plea, the defence urged the court to bear in mind that the accused regrets his actions and he is now pleading guilty because he is truly remorseful. The defence also provided in a table a summary of its sentencing submissions. For ease of comparison, the table below sets out the sentencing positions of both parties with regard to the proceeded charges:

### 1ST CHARGE (DAC-900976-2018)

80     The accused was convicted for committing gang-robbery under s 391 of the Penal Code and punishable under s 395 of the Penal Code. The prescribed punishment for the offence is an imprisonment term of not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years, with a mandatory minimum of 12 strokes of the cane.

81     The prosecution relied on the case of _PP v Magesan s/o Ramasamy & Ors_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] SGDC 198</span> (“_Magesan_”) where the offenders had similarly impersonated police officers by wearing police uniform and identification tags and using flexi-cuffs to rob victims in the business of illegal remittance. The total amount of money stolen in _Magesan_ was $1,274,191, out of which $899,320 was recovered by the police. Out of the five offenders, one of them, Ansari, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for the s 395 charge.

82     In the present case, the loss occasioned was approximately $300,000 which was far less as compared to that in _Magesan_. Accordingly, I agree with both prosecution’s and defence’s submissions that the starting point for sentencing should be adjusted downwards. However, I took into account the fact the accused had played an active role to hatch the plan about a month prior to the commission of the offence. There was also a significant level of premeditation and organisation that went into the planning, with 12 separate actors who on the day of the offence who were assigned roles and responsibilities as part of the criminal endeavour. Lastly, I took in account a housebreaking charge under s 456 read with s 34 of the Penal Code which the accused had admitted to. In view of the above factors, I am of the view that a sentence of 7 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane is appropriate. As this charge arose out of a separate incident in relation to the rest of the charges, I ordered for the imprisonment term in this sentence to run consecutively.

### 4TH CHARGE (DAC-928832-2019), 7TH CHARGE (DAC-928835-2018) and 8TH CHARGE (DAC-928836-2018)

83     In respect of the charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code, the maximum punishment prescribed for the offence is imprisonment for a term up to 2 years, or with fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both. I agree with the defence’s submission that based on the sentencing framework for s 323 offences in the High Court case of _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span>, the present case fell within “Band 1” of the indicative sentencing range, and a short custodial sentence of not more than 4 weeks’ imprisonment would be commensurate with the accused’s culpability. Therefore, in line with the prosecution’s sentencing position that a short custodial sentence should be imposed, I imposed an imprisonment term of 1 month.

84     With regard to the charge under s 147 read with s 146 of the Penal Code, the maximum punishment is an imprisonment term up to 7 years and caning. The prosecution submitted that ordinarily it would have sought for a sentence of at least 21 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane given the severity of the offence. However, in light of the totality principle and their submission for the sentence to be run consecutively, the sentence was calibrated downwards to 18 months’ imprisonment (with no caning). In addition, the prosecution pointed out that the co-accused for this same charge, Fahmi, had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an imprisonment term of 18 months, a sentence that was also calibrated to take into account the fact that he had already been serving a sentence of 2 years and 6 months’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane for an unrelated charge under s 324 read with s 34 of the Penal Code at the material time. The defence also submitted that an appropriate custodial sentence should not be more than 18 months’ imprisonment. Bearing in mind the above and also the principle of parity as between co-accused persons, I imposed an imprisonment term of 18 months for this charge which is to run consecutively.

85     As for the charge under s 148 read with s 149 of the Penal Code, the maximum punishment for the offence is an imprisonment term of up to 10 years and caning. The prosecution submitted for 36 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. The defence in their written mitigation plea highlighted the case of _PP v Nirmal Singh_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 293</span> (“_Nirmal Singh_”) where the offender had initially claimed trial but eventually pleaded guilty on the first day of trial to a charge under s 148 read with s 149 of the Penal Code. The court in _Nirmal Singh_ held that the late plea of guilt may be of little mitigating value, and an appropriate custodial sentence would have been between 32-34 months’ imprisonment. However, considering the fact that the offender in that case had already been remanded for about a month before his release on bail, the court eventually arrived at a custodial term of 31 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane.

86     The cases submitted by the prosecution in their sentencing table suggest that the sentences for s 148 read with s 149 of the Penal Code range from between 36 months’ imprisonment to 5 years’ imprisonment with up to 12 strokes of the cane imposed. In the case of _Md Anverdeen Basheer Ahmed & ors v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGHC 233</span> (“_Md Anverdeen_”), a fight subsequently ensued between a group of offenders and the staff at a pub. Wooden poles, knives and an ice pick were used. Although minor injuries were suffered by the parties themselves, significant damage was caused to the interior of the pub. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 36 months imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for 3 of the offenders. On appeal, Yong Pung How CJ (as he then was) held that the sentence of 36 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane was not manifestly excessive, considering there were various factors to indicate the seriousness of the offence such as the violence involved, the deadly weapons used, the large group of people and that the offence was committed in a public place. This is not too far off from the defence’s cited precedent of _Nirmal Singh_ which would have imposed a sentence of between 32-34 months’ if the period of remand for the offender in that case had not been taken into account.

87     In my view, the present case bears close resemblance to _Md Anverdeen_ in that the rioting with deadly weapon (here a baseball bat) was committed in public (outside a 7-11) and involved a relatively large group of people. Moreover, I noted that there were several aggravating factors in this case. First, the incident was related to activities of a secret society where the accused had played a key role to initiate the chain of events. Second, this led to one other charge of unlawful assembly under s 143 of the Penal Code admitted by the accused which I took into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Third, the relentless assault and pursuit of the victims resulted in the death of the two deceased persons who were trying to flee from the assault in a state of panic. Nonetheless, I exercised some leniency towards the accused for having pleaded guilty and accordingly, I imposed a sentence of 36 months’ and 4 strokes of the cane for this charge.

### 5TH CHARGE (DAC-928833-2018)

88     The prescribed punishment for an offence under s 14(3) of the Societies Act is an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both. Prosecution pointed out that co-accused Fahmi who had faced the same offence for being a member of the same “Omega” secret society as the accused had pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment. The prosecution is now seeking for the same sentence to be meted out to the accused. As for the defence, it cited the recent case of _PP v Chua Kok Thye_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 125</span> (“_Chua Kok Thye_”) where the accused faced 2 proceeded charges including a charge under s 14(3) of the Societies Act. The accused in that case was a member of an unlawful society from 1984 to 1990, and following his plea of guilt he was sentenced to 2 weeks’ imprisonment. As compared to _Chua Kok Thye_, the defence submitted that the accused in the present case had a lower culpability as he had only been a member for about 6 months. As such, the defence is asking for a sentence of not more than 2 weeks’ imprisonment.

89     The charge states that the accused was a member of the “Omega” Secret Society from August 2017 to January 2018. However, based on the statement of facts, the accused’s involvement and connection with secret societies can be traced back to as early as 2007 when he was a “Fighter” of the “Sio Kun Tong” Secret Society. Between January 2011 and July 2011, the accused joined the “Omega” Secret Society as a “Fighter” before he was subsequently imprisoned for drug trafficking in May 2013. After his release from prison, the accused once again joined the secret society in August 2017. Apart from his history of involvement, he was also appointed as “Senior Member” when he joined the “Omega” Secret Society in August 2017 on account of his “experience” and previous affiliation with the “Omega” Secret Society. Therefore, a higher degree of culpability should be accorded in view of the greater level of influence. Having regard to the factors stated as well as Fahmi’s sentence, I imposed an imprisonment term of 5 months for this charge.

### 9TH CHARGE (DAC-902141-2019) and 10TH CHARGE (DAC-902171-2019)

90     Dealing first with the charge under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act, the maximum prescribed punishment is an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years with a minimum mandatory 6 strokes of the cane. The prosecution submitted that the “entry point” sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane should be meted out. Similarly, the defence highlighted the case of _PP v Muhammad Qayyuum bin Sulong_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 266</span> where the court held that the usual sentence for such an offence is 6 months’ imprisonment as well as the mandatory minimum of 6 strokes of the cane. Therefore I imposed the same sentence of 6 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane on the accused in the present case.

91     Moving to the charge under s 324 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, the offence attracts an imprisonment term of up to 7 years, together with fine or caning. Based on their sentencing precedents, the prosecution submitted that the sentence ranges from 18 months’ imprisonment to 3 years and 6 months’ imprisonment with up to 6 strokes of the cane. The prosecution sought a sentence of at least 18 months’ imprisonment adjusted for the principle of totality. No caning was sought for this charge as the abovementioned charge under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act was proceeded against the accused where a minimum of 6 strokes of the cane is mandatory. On the other hand, the defence pointed to the case of _Ng Soon Kim v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 247</span> (“_Ng Soon Kim_”) where the offender used fire to cause hurt to the victim. The defence submitted that in the present case, if the accused had been charged under s 323 of the Penal Code, his culpability would have fallen within the higher end of “Band 2” which attracts an indicative sentencing range of between 4 weeks’ to 6 months’ imprisonment. According to the defence, since it was Farouk and not the accused who had swung or used the parang, a suitable uplift would be about 6 months and accordingly an imprisonment term of not more than 12 months would be appropriate.

92     Applying the sentencing framework in _Ng Soon Kim_, I agree with the defence that based on the harm caused, the starting point for the present case falls within the higher end of “Band 2” of moderate harm. At the second step, I considered that the dangerous means used in this case to inflict the injuries were bladed weapons such as parangs and knives which possess a moderate to high potential for harm. At the third step, I considered the other various aggravating and mitigating circumstances at play. The present case involves a co-ordinated group assault on unarmed victims. Apart from Farouk, there were at least two others, including the accused himself, who were also holding on to knives. When they were pursuing and chasing down the victims, Muhammad was slashed by one of the accused persons. Within the same incident, there was one other victim, Ismail, who was seriously injured with a deep laceration with a partial muscle cut to his lower back and an open chip fracture to his left acromion. Ismail is the victim of the charge under s 326 read with s 34 of the Penal Code which the accused had consented to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

93     Further, the offence was committed while the accused was out on court bail. The High Court in _PP v Loqmanual Hakim bin Buang_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 753</span> held that the commission of an offence while on bail was aggravating in nature as it squarely engages the principle of deterrence – the enhanced sanctions reflect the abuse of trust and the manifested proclivity for offending behaviour. The principle was also endorsed in the High Court case of _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 500</span> where the learned Chao Hick Tin JA opined that such a behaviour demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence (at \[29\]):

> “In my judgment, there is only one good reason for elevating the appellant’s sentence beyond the indicative starting point – which is very close to or at the mandatory minimum of ten years’ imprisonment and ten strokes of the cane – and it is the fact that he committed the offences while out on bail. It demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention...”

94     Nonetheless, some mitigating weight is given as the accused did eventually plead guilty. Taking all of these into account, an appropriate sentence would be an imprisonment term of 18 months, and I ordered the sentence for this charge to run consecutively.

## CONCLUSION

95     I shall also briefly address the defence’s arguments in relation to which of the proceeded charges should be ordered to run consecutively. I accept the defence’s submission that the charge under s 395 of the Penal Code should stand as a separate incident for which the sentence should be ordered to run consecutive. However, I disagree that the rest of the proceeded charges should be grouped together as they stem from the same root cause of the accused’s involvement in the unlawful society. Applying the one-transaction rule, the 4th Charge, 7th Charge and 8th Charge which pertain to the incident at the Club, and the 9th and 10th Charge which pertain to the incident at Ang Mo Kio, should be seen as distinct criminal transactions. Both the prosecution and the defence proposed that 3 of the sentences should run consecutively which I believe to be correct given that there are in total 3 separate incidents.

96     All considered, taking into account all the relevant factors including the plea in mitigation, I passed the following sentences on the accused:

97     I ordered the terms of imprisonment of 7 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in DAC-900976-2018 and 18 months’ imprisonment in DAC-902141-2019 and 18 months’ imprisonment in DAC-928836-2018 to run consecutively, yielding a total sentence of 7 years’ and 36 months’ imprisonment and 22 strokes of the cane. The aggregate sentenced imposed is just and proportionate to the overall criminality of the accused in the present case and not excessive.

98     The sentence should be backdated to the 20 February 2018 as he had been in remand since this date. The accused is now serving his sentence.
