15 March 2022

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The plaintiff, Khan Mohammad Nasir Uddin (“Khan”), was at the material time, employed by the 1st defendants.

2       The Statement of Claim (“SOC”) averred that at the material time, the 1st defendants had assigned Khan to work for the 2nd defendants (“Jin Sheng”), a contractor, for works to be carried out at premises at 58 Seletar North Link Singapore (the “Premises”).

3       The 3rd defendants were, at the material time, the occupier of the Premises.

4       Khan claimed that he suffered a fall at work on 30 January 2016 and sustained injuries as a result. Khan commenced this action against all three defendants, claiming damages.

5       The 1st defendants failed to enter an appearance and Khan had earlier obtained interlocutory judgment against the 1st defendants for damages to be assessed.

6       This action proceeded to trial before me: at the start of the trial, both Jin Sheng and the 3rd defendants were defending the action against them and were represented respectively by (separate) Counsel. The trial was heard on a bifurcated basis and only the issue of liability was to be decided.

7       In the midst of the trial, the Counsel for the 3rd defendants ceased to act for the 3rd defendants. The 3rd defendants were thereafter absent from the trial and unrepresented. After the close of Khan’s case, only Jin Sheng presented their defence.

8       After hearing all the evidence and having considered the closing submissions put forward by respective Counsel for Khan and for Jin Sheng, I dismissed Khan’s claim against Jin Sheng with costs of the action to be paid by Khan to Jin Sheng.

9       As the 3rd defendants had failed to put forward their defence, interlocutory judgment against the 3rd defendants was entered in favour of Khan, for damages to be assessed, with costs reserved.

10     Khan appealed against the decision to dismiss his claim against Jin Sheng with costs.

11     Before delivering the Verdict, I made the following oral remarks (in \[12\] to \[45\] below. These oral remarks are now incorporated into these Grounds of Decision.

12     “I am just going to give a few brief oral remarks before delivering the verdict for this matter. The remarks do not form all the grounds for the decision and may be added to or elaborated upon should the need arise. Today the verdict concerns the suit specifically between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendants.

13     “The 1st defendants, I believe, failed to enter appearance and as I understand, the plaintiff has interlocutory judgment against the 1st defendants.

14     “The 3rd defendants had played a part earlier in the proceedings but failed to proceed thereafter when we came back for the further tranche. So, we only have the 2nd defendants. At this stage again I would like to thank Mr. Jogesh, Mr. Lim, and Mr. Lee for your respective submissions on behalf of your respective clients. I found them to be very useful and very cogent in your arguments.

15     “Now, it goes without saying that in any claim and again, I am restricting this to just the claim between the plaintiff and the 2nd defendants, the plaintiff has the burden of proving his case against the 2nd defendants, on a balance of probabilities.

16     “This case is centred around an alleged accident at a workplace, and as far as the 2nd defendants are concerned, they have no eye witness as to how the incident had occurred. Now, again, it goes without saying that in a case like this where there is uncertainty at the start of the proceedings as to how an incident occurred, it is essential that the starting point has to be made very clear. The pleadings have to be clear and have to set out the litigant’s case in very clear and cogent terms.

17     “We look at the plaintiff’s Statement of Claim (SOC) and we could home in on the material aspects. Paragraph 5, “On 30th January 2016, the Plaintiff was instructed to place concrete stone blocks on the precast concrete block at the worksite in order that another precast block could be stacked on top of the one below. The Plaintiff would repeat the process so that the precast blocks could be stacked one on top of the other. In order to carry out the stacking work, the Plaintiff was provided with a vertical ladder to reach the top of the stack.” Paragraph 6, “At about 8 am (‘the material time’), while the Plaintiff was on the top layer of the precast block stack, which at the material time was about 3 metres in height and carrying out the work as foresaid, he lost his balance and fell on the ground, thereby sustaining serious injuries.” Then it goes on to cite, breaches of various forms of duty that the plaintiff pleads against the respective defendants.

18     “Now, again it goes without saying that in a trial of this nature at this stage, we are concerned only with the issue of liability, and where that is concerned, in civil procedure, the Affidavit of the Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) is the crucial piece of evidence that we look at to have recourse to and consider the respective strengths or weaknesses of the respective parties.

19     “I would just quote certain portions of the plaintiff’s AEIC as far as the accident is concerned. We can start from paragraph 14 of the AEIC, “On the material day, I was instructed by my supervisor to place stone blocks as described above on a precast stack. This was a continuation of the work on an unfinished stack that was done the day before. I used the vertical ladder that was provided to me to climb to the uppermost layer of the precast stack that was about 3 metres high.”

20     “Paragraph 15, “As I was standing on the top of the precast stack and carrying out the work, I lost my balance and fell about 3 metres to the ground and thereby sustained serious injuries.”

21     “Paragraph 16, “After the fall, although I was conscious, I was in a state of shock. I was subsequently conveyed to hospital.”

22     “At this stage, since we are at the AEIC, I would just quote certain paragraphs further down. And this is in relation to what the 2nd defendants put forth as what is phrased to be the “Incident Investigation Report” of the 2nd defendants. For ease of reference we can look at 2DBD, this appears at pages 3 to 11.

23     “Now, the heading just above paragraph 99 of the AEIC of the plaintiff states “The incident investigation report that was allegedly signed by me”, meaning the plaintiff. At paragraph 99, “The 2nd defendants have shown an incident investigation report that purportedly reports how the accident occurred... At page 67, it is alleged that I signed the report. The alleged report supports the 2nd defendants’ version of how the accident happened.”

24     “Paragraph 100, “The alleged report is a whitewash of the accident concocted by the 2nd defendants to exculpate themselves and to put the blame on me.”

25     “I emphasise that words “concocted by the 2nd defendants”.

26     “Paragraph 101, “I wish to state the following in respect of the alleged report. a. I cannot recall the Defendants conducting an interview with me, nor can I recall any statements taken from me to record the facts of the accident; b. I cannot recall being shown the contents of the alleged report nor did anyone explain the contents of the alleged report in the Bengali language; c. I cannot recall signing on any page of the alleged report.”

27     “Paragraph 102, “I wish to state that the Defendants did not conduct any formal interview with me after the accident. My supervisor Babul did not take any statement from me and none is shown by the 2nd Defendants in the documents they have disclosed. I am advised that this is improper as it is a requirement under regulations in force that a formal interview be conducted and a statement be taken of the victim and any witnesses.”

28     “Paragraph 103, “After I was discharged from the hospital, I do recall speaking to Babul and a woman whose name I cannot recall. I also recall explaining to them how the accident happened. However, no formal interviews or statements were taken as I had stated above.”

29     “Paragraph 104, and this is crucial. “I can state with certainty that had such a document been shown to me and explained to me, I certainly would not have signed such a document.”

30     “At this stage it would be important to state, what this document contains which the Plaintiff has taken objection to. It would mainly be found in paragraphs 4 and 5, appearing on page 4 of 2DBD. Paragraph 4, “On 30.01.2016, 8:00 am, the injured worker was standing on the ground and placing the concrete cube (100 millimetre by 100 millimetre by 100 millimetre) to the top of precast component (about 1.4 metres height). He put 2 concrete cubes to the top of precast component and one of it was not reach by his hand. And he stood up with one leg on the concrete cube (100 millimetre by 100 millimetre by 100 millimetre) located on the ground, to get it back, (without using the ladder nearby). And he was tripping, falling to the ground and he got injury on his forearm. Safety supervisor immediately sent him to KTP Hospital.”

31     “Paragraph 5, Findings, “The injured worker working easy/lazy way. He failed to use the ladder to get the concrete cube. He was using the wrong method.”

32     “Now, this version runs completely counter to the version that the plaintiff has placed before the Court as to how the incident occurred. The evidence suggested and I make the finding that this was the version that the 2nd defendants had obtained from what Babul and Ms. Phyo had elicited from the plaintiff. It could not be a version that the 2nd defendants had fabricated out of thin air. I will come back to this shortly.

33     “Now, the plaintiff’s evidence in the final reckoning had a lot of inconsistencies. I would just point out a few of them. One was the use of the ladder. When one goes through the Notes of Evidence, one gets the impression that it is not clear at all which ladder had been used by the plaintiff in his assertion that he had used the ladder. His version that he had climbed the ladder up to the 3 metres could not be believed. There is no indication that there was a ladder of such a height. The only pictorial evidence we have again can be seen from 2DBD, the bundle, and perhaps we can look at pages 7 and 8. The evidence of the plaintiff in terms of the ladder was quite unclear.

34     “In Cross-Examination, at various points, he could not state with any certainty what sort of ladder he had used and in fact, he seemed to indicate that the ladder he had used was shorter than the one that appears on page 7. Even taking the ladder in page 7, looking at the scale that we have, who is accepted to be Mr. Babul standing there in the photograph on page 7. We can see that this ladder could not possibly have reached the height of 3 metres and yet the plaintiff as I said whose evidence was not clear on this point appears to say that he was using a ladder that was shorter than this. Even allowing for the big risk of memory of even using this ladder, it could not possibly have reached a height of 3 metres. And again, as I said, there is no evidence that there were any ladders of a taller height that the plaintiff could have used.

35     “Another area of inconsistency was whether the Plaintiff had been unconscious after the fall. In his AEIC, he said he was conscious. Paragraph 16, “After the fall, although I was conscious, I was in a state of shock.” In his Cross-Examination, he indicated that he was unconscious. His inconsistency showed that there were certain parts of his narrative which may be unreliable.

36     “Another crucial point was whether any of the co-workers had witnessed this. Again, a perusal of the evidence does not lead us to any clear conclusion as to whether it is the plaintiff’s case or not that there were any workers who had witnessed. In any event, no such worker was called by the Plaintiff to give evidence on his behalf to support his version. As I said, the starting point appears to be that nobody, save for the plaintiff, can really say how this accident had actually occurred.

37     “I accepted the 2nd defendant’s evidence that to begin with, the plaintiff was not a worker required to work at height. So, in this regard, there would not have been any necessity for him to reach heights of 3 metres. If he had done so, basically to use that commonly used phrase, he would have been on a frolic of his own. It was clearly not within his job scope or his work instructions.

38     “Turning back to the investigation report, this was the version that the 2nd defendants suggest had occurred. This was countered by the plaintiff to say that this was not true, he had fallen from a height of 3 metres. And for those portions that I had read from the AEIC, we note that he says he cannot recall but he does admit that he had spoken to Babul and the woman whose name he says he cannot recall. So, we have two possibilities here, either this version that we see on page 4 in 2DBD represents the version as told to Babul and Ms. Phyo by the Plaintiff and therefore recorded as the version of the incident or is this a complete fabrication by the 2nd defendants to absolve themselves of blame. And again, to stress paragraph 104 of the AEIC, the plaintiff says “I can state with certainty that had such a document been shown to me and explained to me, I certainly would not have signed such a document.”

39     “What is clearly missing from this is that faced with a document like this, an official document that the 2nd defendants put forward as the version of the incident, the plaintiff did not see it fit to make a police report to say that the 2nd defendants have completely concocted the story and for the police to investigate whether or not that signature was or was not the plaintiff’s on page 5 of 2DBD: whether it was a forgery, whether the 2nd defendants had, again to use a loose term, copied and pasted his signature onto this.

40     “In either event, whether it is a forgery or a “copy and paste”, it would be something dishonest, fraudulent and ought to have been reported to the police. No such report appears to have taken place and we do take into account that this was evidence that was put forward for purposes of defending themselves in this matter.

41     “Then we can come to only one conclusion, the plaintiff cannot say for sure that he did not sign this and that this constituted the version that he had informed Mr. Babul and Ms. Phyo.

42     “The plaintiff has that burden to prove on a balance of probabilities that he fell from 3 metres. The evidence certainly shows that he did not discharge this burden. The 2nd defendants do not need to prove in that sense their defence so long as they are able to stop the plaintiff from proving on a balance of probabilities. In this case, it is my finding that the plaintiff has fallen far short of discharging that duty.

43     “There is simply insufficient evidence to show and to indicate that he had climbed to a height of 3 metres. Even looking at the photograph on page 7, understandably the plaintiff cannot say for sure that this is where the fall and the incident had occurred, but as I said, he would have to prove and discharge the evidentiary burden that he had fallen from a height of 3 metres.

44     “The evidence simply does not show that there was a ladder in the vicinity that could allow him to reach that particular height bearing in mind that that was the only means with which the plaintiff says that he had used to reach that height.

45     “The evidence during the trial did not support his case that there was a ladder sufficiently long for him to have used, to reach such a height. So, as a whole as I said, the plaintiff vis-à-vis the 2nd defendants has failed to prove his case on a balance of probabilities. Therefore the plaintiff’s claim as against the 2nd defendants has to be dismissed with costs.”

46     Hence, I dismissed Khan’s claim against Jin Sheng with costs to be paid by Khan to Jin Sheng.

47     It could not be overstated that as the alleged fall of Khan had not been witnessed by anyone within the knowledge of Jin Sheng, it was crucial for Khan’s claim to be pleaded with certainty and consistency. Khan had pleaded his case based on one unwavering version. There was no other, alternative averment made by Khan. His case (against Jin Sheng) would thus stand or fall on the basis of whether he was able to prove this version on a balance of probabilities. This single version simply could not be believed, based on the evidence presented at trial. Khan’s version of the alleged fall had to be rejected.

48     Khan’s claim that he had reached a height of 3 metres simply could not be believed. A careful consideration of the evidence shows that Khan could not have reached that height. The conclusion that Khan had not proven his case against Jin Sheng was the only viable one to be made, after a full consideration of all the evidence and the closing submissions made.

49     Khan had obtained interlocutory judgment for damages to be assessed, against both the 1st defendants and now, the 3rd defendants.

50     Khan appealed against the dismissal of his claim as against Jin Sheng, the 2nd defendants, with costs. Such costs were ordered to be taxed, if not agreed.
