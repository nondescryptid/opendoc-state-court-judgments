\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9186/2022/01.\]

20 September 2022 - Judgment reserved.

### District Judge Paul Chan:

1       The accused, Mr Hong Ban Joo, is a Singapore citizen, aged 51. He faces 21 charges of cheating and dishonestly inducing four different individuals to deliver property to him under section 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “**Penal Code**”). The accused initially claimed trial to these charges and his trial was scheduled to take place from 22 – 24 June 2022. A week prior to the commencement of the trial, counsel for the Defence informed the Prosecution that the accused intended to take a certain course in relation to these charges. In response, the Prosecution offered to proceed on six of these charges, with the rest to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. Accordingly, the accused pleaded guilty to the proceeded charges on 22 June 2022 and consented to having the other charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

2       The details of proceeded charges and the sentences I impose in respect of these charges are set out below.

3       These are my reasons for imposing the above sentences.

## Facts

4       The facts in support of the charges are mostly set out in a Statement of Facts to which the accused admitted without qualification. I set out a brief summary below.

5       At all material times, the accused was a broker with NoaFX, a forex brokerage which offers online trading services for trading in currencies. In that capacity, the accused was issued with multiple dummy accounts on the NoaFX platform. These dummy accounts were meant to be used to test out trading strategies without risk – it would neither involve real money nor incur transaction fees. A dummy account would have the same appearance as a genuine trading account on NoaFX such that a user of the platform would not be able to distinguish between the two.

### Facts relating to the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 7th charges

6       The 1st, 3rd, 4th and 7th charges involve a victim known as Tan Kok Liang, Shawn (“**Mr Tan**”). Mr Tan and the accused were acquaintances. Between 2013 and 2015, Mr Tan transferred a total of $660,000 to the accused, of which $370,000 is the subject matter of the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 7th charges. By agreement, the accused was supposed to use these monies for forex trading and pay Mr Tan a fixed return of 8% per month. This agreement was recorded in a document called the “Fund Management Agreement”, which was signed by the accused. According to the Prosecution, the accused did not have any intention to use all of Mr Tan’s monies for investments. Instead, the accused intended to use part of the monies to pay his creditors and did, ultimately, use 80% to 90% of Mr Tan’s monies to do so. To further this deception, the accused provided Mr Tan with access to dummy accounts to convince Mr Tan that his monies were put into real trading accounts.

7       Between July 2013 and September 2015, the accused gave Mr Tan about $200,000 as purported returns from investments made by the accused. In truth, these sums were derived from other individuals who had invested their money with the accused. Between October 2015 and February 2017, the accused gave Mr Tan $80,000 as restitution for misappropriating Mr Tan’s money.

### Facts relating to the 15th and 17th charges

8       The 15th and 17th charges involve a victim known as Sarafraz Akthar s/o Abdul Aziz @ Sarfraz Akthar Ali (“**Mr Ali**”). Mr Ali and the accused were neighbours. Between March and August 2015, Mr Ali transferred a total of $354,000[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) to the accused, of which $175,000 is the subject matter of the 15th and 17th charges. By agreement, the accused was supposed to use these monies to trade in forex and shares and pay Mr Ali a fixed return of 2.5% per month. This agreement was also recorded in a document called the “Fund Management Agreement”. According to the Prosecution, the accused did not have any intention to use all of Mr Ali’s monies for investments. Instead, the accused intended to use part of the monies to pay his creditors and did, ultimately, use all of Mr Ali’s monies to do so.

9       In October 2015, the accused gave Mr Ali $35,000 as purported returns from investments made by the accused. According to the Defence, the accused also made restitution of $31,000 to Mr Ali between August 2021 and July 2022.

### Other victims

10     The accused perpetrated a similar investment scam on one Tan Joon Hwa (involving the total sum of $100,000) and one Lee Kai Mun (involving the total sum of $14,000). The accused used all of monies received from Mr Tan Joon Hwa and Mr Lee Kai Mun to pay the accused’s creditors.

11     The accused has made restitution of $36,080 to Mr Tan Joon Hwa but made no restitution to Mr Lee Kai Mun.

## Prescribed Penalties

12     Under section 420 of the Penal Code, the prescribed punishment for an offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing a person to deliver any property is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years. The accused shall also be liable to a fine.

13     The 3rd charge is an amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“**CPC**”). For this charge, section 124(8) of the CPC provides that this court may sentence the accused to two times the amount of punishment to which the accused would otherwise have been liable if the accused had been charged with and convicted of any one of the incidents of commission of the offence under section 420 of the Penal Code.

## Antecedents

14     The accused is untraced.

## Submissions

### Prosecution’s position

15     The Prosecution submitted that general and specific deterrence are the dominant sentencing considerations in the present case. As regards general deterrence, the Prosecution highlighted that the offence of investment scams is becoming prevalent in Singapore and there are multiple victims involved in the present offences. As regards specific deterrence, the Prosecution pointed out that the crime was premeditated.

16     In addressing the relevant sentencing factors, the Prosecution considered that the amount cheated is large, being $1,128,000. The Prosecution accepted that the outstanding loss caused to the victims was considerably less. This was a result of two factors. First, the accused made restitution to some of the victims. The restitution made post-offence eventually amounted to $147,080. Second, as part of the scam, the accused had provided purported returns in the sum of $235,000 to two of the victims (the “**Purported Returns**”). The Prosecution submitted that minimal mitigatory weight should be accorded to the sums returned by way of purported investment returns.

17     Where culpability was concerned, the Prosecution highlighted that the accused had premeditated his offences with a level of sophistication, the scams were perpetrated over two years, there was persistence in offending as the cheating occurred over 26 occasions and there were four victims. The Prosecution also accepted that some mitigating weight ought to be accorded to the accused’s plea of guilt although this must be attenuated by the fact that it occurred only one week before trial and 1.5 years after he was charged.

18     Having regard to various precedent cases which I will address subsequently, the Prosecution submitted sentences of between 16 months’ and 24 months’ imprisonment for each of the individual proceeded charges. The greater the sum involved, the longer the imprisonment term proposed. On an aggregate level, the Prosecution submitted that four of the sentences should run consecutively for a global sentence of 80 months’ imprisonment. The Prosecution noted that the accused is a persistent offender, there is public interest in deterring like-minded offenders and there are multiple victims. By the Prosecution’s reckoning, a global sentence of 80 months’ imprisonment satisfies the totality principle as it is not crushing.

19     I set out the particulars of the Prosecution’s proposed sentences for each specific charge as well as the charges it proposes should run consecutively in a table at para \[25\].

## Mitigation and Defence’s position

20     The Defence approached sentencing by, firstly, determining the appropriate individual sentences for each of the charges. In this regard, the Defence had reference to a sentencing framework set out in _Public Prosecutor v Gene Chong Soon Hui_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 117</span> (“**_Gene Chong_**”). On the basis of _Gene Chong_ and other cases, the Defence submitted that the present case involved slight to moderate harm. The Defence highlighted that, after accounting for the sums which the victims have received from the accused, the total outstanding loss stands at $745,920 and the total outstanding loss in relation to the proceeded charges is $514,000. On this point, the Defence submitted that the Purported Returns is relevant for the purposes of sentencing as it indicates that the economic harm suffered by the victims has been reduced.

21     The Defence was also of the view that the present case involved slight to moderate culpability. In support of this position, the Defence submitted that the scam was not sophisticated and that the period of offending, which was just over 2 years, was not long, relative to other cases. Taken together, the Defence submitted that the indicative sentencing range should be between 6 to 18 months’ imprisonment.

22     In relation to offender-specific factors, the Defence highlighted that the accused has cooperated with the authorities, has decided to plead guilty which saved significant resources, made partial restitution and did not have antecedents. Having regard to these factors and precedent cases, the Defence submitted that sentences of between 11 to 18 months should be imposed for the six charges.

23     The Defence disagreed that four of the sentences should run consecutively. In the view of the Defence, running four sentences consecutively would be disproportionate when compared to case precedents. The Defence also posited that an aggregate sentence of 80 months’ imprisonment would fall afoul of the totality principle. This is because a sentence of 80 months’ imprisonment represents almost 3.5 times the Prosecution’s proposed sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment for the most serious charge. The Defence also submitted that such a sentence would not be in keeping with the accused’s hitherto clean criminal record and would be crushing when compared with other cases. Instead, the Defence proposed that three sentences should run together and that the global sentence should be 44 months’ imprisonment.

24     In mitigation, the Defence submitted that the accused is genuinely remorseful for his actions.

### Summary of sentencing positions

25     A summary of the Prosecution’s and Defence’s proposed sentences is set out below.

## Issues to be determined

26     Arising from the parties’ submissions, the following issues arise for determination in the present case.

> (a)     Whether the sentencing framework set out in _Gene Chong_ should be used in the present case.

> (b)     Whether the Purported Returns have any relevance in sentencing and, if so, how they are relevant.

> (c)     What sentences should be imposed in respect of each charge?

> (d)     What is a fair and proportionate global sentence?

## Issue 1: Sentencing approach

27     As mentioned above, the Defence relied on a sentencing framework set out in _Gene Chong_ in calibrating the appropriate sentences. The case of _Gene Chong_ involved offences under sections 420 and 477A of the Penal Code. As regards sentencing for the section 420 offences, the court used a harm-culpability framework to provide indicative sentencing ranges for different degrees of harm and culpability. The appeal against sentence was dismissed by the High Court but no detailed grounds of decision were issued. This framework was subsequently used in several District Court decisions, including _Public Prosecutor v Tan Wen Jie_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 183</span> (“**_Tan Wen Jie_**”).

28     It is notable that, subsequent to the dismissal of the appeal against the decision in _Gene Chong_, the High Court has been slow to endorse or adopt the _Gene Chong_ framework. On the other hand, the High Court has not expressly rejected the _Gene Chong_ framework outright. The closest the High Court has come to rejecting the _Gene Chong_ framework is in the appeal against the decision of _Tan Wen Jie_ (MA/9090/2021/01) (the “**_Tan Wen Jie_** **Appeal**”). In that appeal, the High Court intimated that the use of the _Gene Chong_ framework “may lead to unjust outcomes with insufficient consideration for the unique facts of each case” because of the “diverse factual scenarios in which a s 420 PC offence may present itself”.

29     At the same time, the Court hearing the _Tan Wen Jie_ Appeal appeared to limit its views to the case before it. No judgment was published to explain the appellate decision. However, part of the _ex tempore_ reasons for the decision was reproduced in _Public Prosecutor v Cheow Boon Peng_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGDC 87</span> (“**_Cheow Boon Peng_**”) (at \[61\]) as follows:

> Subsequently, on 25 January 2022, a decision of the High Court was pronounced which would have implications to the approach described in the foregoing. This was the case of _Public Prosecutor v Tan Wen Jie_… where Vincent Hoong J, in an _ex-tempore_ judgment, held:

>> … I am of the view that it would be inappropriate to rely on (_PP v Gene Chong’s proposed s 420 Penal Code_) framework in the present case. Given the diverse factual scenarios in which a s 420 PC offence may present itself, recourse to a single framework may lead to unjust outcomes with insufficient consideration for the unique facts of each case. For this reason, **_I am of the view that_** **_the better approach_** **_in the present case is to have regard to_** **_analogous precedents with similar fact patterns_** **_in arriving at a fair sentence._**

> \[Emphasis in original.\]

30     While the High Court, in deciding the _Tan Wen Jie_ Appeal, did hold that it would be inappropriate to rely on the _Gene Chong_ framework, this was expressly stated to be for the purposes of “the present case”. Similarly, while the Court held that the better approach was to have regard to analogous precedents with similar fact patterns, this was caveated by the phrase “in the present case”. Thus, it is not at all clear that the _Gene Chong_ framework is dead in the water.

31     That the _Gene Chong_ framework has not been altogether overruled was confirmed in _Toh Suat Leng Jennifer v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2022\] SGHC 146</span> (“**_Jennifer Toh_**”), which decision was delivered after the _Tan Wen Jie_ Appeal. In _Jennifer Toh_, the Prosecution and the Court below relied on the _Gene Chong_ framework. Be that as it may, the High Court declined to opine on the applicability of the _Gene Chong_ framework. Instead, the High Court held (at \[74\]) that “… this is not the proper case for me to consider the correctness of the stated framework. I shall therefore leave it open for consideration by a future court on a later occasion.”

32     Given the above remarks, the fate of the _Gene Chong_ framework is uncertain and questionable at best. In these circumstances, it would be, in my view, unwise to continue to apply the _Gene Chong_ framework. Even if the framework has not been overruled altogether, the reservations expressed by the High Court in the _Tan Wen Jie_ Appeal continue to hold. I am therefore of the view that it would be more appropriate - and more fair - at the present time to take the cue from the High Court in the _Tan Wen Jie_ Appeal and use a precedent-based, incremental approach. This requires a survey of similar cases and locating the present case along that spectrum.

## Issue 2: Sentencing relevance of Purported Returns

33     Before turning to the sentencing proper, there is one more issue that ought to be addressed. This is regarding the relevance to sentencing of monies received by the victims from the accused as part of the investment scam. As mentioned earlier, the total loss occasioned to the victims was reduced significantly from the sum cheated by the accused. This was a function of two factors. One was restitution that the accused made post-offence. The second was the Purported Returns. The accused had given Mr Tan the sum of $200,000 and Mr Ali the sum of $35,000 as purported investment returns. In truth, these sums were derived from other investors and were used by the accused to induce Mr Tan and Mr Ali into believing that their principal sums were actually being invested.

34     The Prosecution submitted that such sums must be accorded minimal mitigatory weight. In the Prosecution’s view, such sums are often distributed as part of an offender’s scheme to keep victims believing that his scheme was working and that their purported investments were generating returns. Even if the investors who received the returns were not, in fact, induced to make further investments, any reduction in loss experienced by the said investors would be at the expense of another victim cheated by the offender. For that reason, the Prosecution posited that such investment returns do not represent an act of remorse and should be accorded low mitigatory weight.

35     The Defence disagreed. Relying on the case of _Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 4 SLR 838</span> (“**_Gan Chai Bee_**”), the Defence submitted that restitution goes not just towards showing remorse. Restitution may also be relevant to ascertaining the economic harm that the victim has suffered. Similarly, sums of monies that were provided to the victims as investment returns also have the very real effect of reducing the economic harm to the victims. Hence, in measuring the harm caused to the victims, the sums of money provided to the victims as investment returns should not be discounted.

36     In my view, both parties are not wrong. In determining the sentencing relevance of the Purported Returns, it is important to be mindful of the precise sentencing factor that one is assessing. The analysis may be made clearer by considering the factors of harm, culpability and remorse separately.

37     First, such sums may be relevant in ascertaining the harm visited on the victims. It has been held that, in financial and property offences, economic value is a useful proxy to assess the degree of harm caused to the victim: _Gan Chai Bee_ (at \[42\]). Where the actual loss suffered by a victim was not as great as it would have been because the offender had provided “investment returns” to the victim, it is, in my view, proper and correct to have full regard to the investment returns provided to the victims in ascertaining the harm actually suffered by the victim. In ascertaining harm, the Court is not, at this stage, concerned with moral blameworthiness; the Court is merely trying to assess, among other things, the actual impact of the crime on the victim and on society. It is therefore not material that the offender was providing the investment returns for nefarious purposes.

38     Secondly, such ostensible investment returns may be relevant to assessing the offender’s culpability. Economic value generally bears less strongly on culpability than it does on harm. This is because culpability refers to the “degree of blameworthiness, measured chiefly in relation to the manner and the motivation of the accused’s involvement in the criminal act”: Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2019) (at para \[11.037\]). However, economic value may be relevant if it bears some correlation with the intentions of the offender. Here, the focus is not on the actual impact of the crime but on the _intentions_ (and therefore the blameworthiness) of the offender. Hence, an offender who _intends_ to cheat a victim of a larger sum of money is, all other things being equal, more culpable than one who intends to cheat a victim of a lesser amount.

39     That said, the presence of such purported investment returns may suggest that the offender is in fact _more culpable_, not less. This is so even if the actual loss suffered by the victim is lowered by the receipt of the investment returns. This is true where the purported investment returns are provided in order to _further_ the criminal endeavour, to allow the offender more time to commit more offences or to induce victims to make further investments or not make enquiries. This was the case in _Public Prosecutor v Julaiha binte Juraimi_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 183</span> where the Court observed (at \[106\]) that “\[t\]he evidence showed that the accused had used the payment of profits to lull her victims into a false sense of security that all was right.” In such a situation, the purported investment returns may actually suggest that the offender’s criminal intent and appetite is _larger_ than that reflected by the actual economic harm occasioned.

40     Finally, one may wonder if such returns should not be treated as “restitution” and thereby possess mitigatory weight. The short answer is no; such investment returns are generally not mitigatory in nature if they were provided to further the criminal scam. The reason is not far to find. Generally, restitution is relevant if it reveals genuine remorse and basic good character: _Krishan Chand v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 1 SLR(R) 737</span> (at \[13\]). Where the investment returns are provided to further the offender’s crime, it cannot be said with any honesty that the act of providing such sums reveals genuine remorse and basic good character. It is for this reason that the Court in _Public Prosecutor v Yeo Keong We alias Roy_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGDC 329</span> disregarded such returns (at \[136\]).

41     In sum, whether purported investment returns are relevant and in what way depends very much on the sentencing factor that is being assessed. Where harm is concerned, such purported investment returns are relevant and ought to be considered in assessing the real impact of the crime on the victim. Where culpability is concerned, such investment returns may in fact suggest that the moral blameworthiness of the offender is actually larger than that suggested by the harm occasioned. Finally, when such purported investments are provided for the purpose of furthering the crime, they in no way provide any indication of genuine remorse or good character.

## Issue 3: Sentences to be imposed for each individual charge

42     Having addressed the two preliminary issues above, I now turn my attention to calibrating the appropriate sentence for each proceeded charge. To do so, I proceed in the following manner. I first identify the dominant sentencing principle applicable to this case, the harm occasioned by the offences, the culpability of the accused and applicable aggravating and mitigating factors. Against that backdrop, I will survey the relevant caselaw and ascertain the sentences that have been imposed in cases with similar fact patterns. Finally, in light of all the above information, I ascribe appropriate sentences to the present charges.

### Dominant sentencing principle

43     In the present case, it cannot be gainsaid that deterrence is the dominant sentencing consideration. This is generally the case where the crime is premeditated as “deterrence probably works best where there is a _conscious_ choice to commit crimes”: _Public Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] SGHC 33</span> (“**_Law Aik Meng_**”) (at \[22\]) (emphasis in original). In this particular case, there can be no question that the crimes were premeditated. However, even more significant than specific deterrence here is general deterrence. It has been held that “considerations of general deterrence must in certain instances take precedence over those of specific or individual deterrence, particularly where the public interest demands that this be so”: _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 653</span> (at \[20\]). The present case, in my judgment, falls into that category of cases.

44     Generally, “general deterrence is an important consideration in many commercial offences”: _Law Aik Meng_ (at \[24(c)\]). Beyond that, however, I accept the Prosecution’s submission that general deterrence should feature especially prominently in the present case as the type of offence in question is becoming increasingly prevalent in Singapore. In support of its contention, the Prosecution tendered an “Annual Crime Brief 2021” released by the Singapore Police Force. In this document, the following information was highlighted:

> (a)     The total number of scam cases reported in 2021 rose by 52.9% from 15,651 cases in 2020 to 23,931 cases in 2021. It made up 51.8% of overall crime in 2021, up from 42% in 2020.

> (b)     Scammers have been taking advantage of the COVID-19 situation to prey on, among other things, the victims’ heightened sense of vulnerability and uncertainty.

> (c)     Investment scams, which is the type of scam perpetrated in the present case, is among the top six scam types in 2021. The number of investment scam cases more than doubled to 2,476 cases in 2021, from 1096 cases in 2020. The total amount cheated increased to at least $190.9 million in 2021, from at least $68.8 million in 2020.

45     This increase does not appear to be a blip in the radar. The Prosecution also produced annual crime briefs for the years 2019 and 2020 and the overall trend remains the same.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2) The increase in both the total number of scam cases and the total number of investment scam cases, in particular, from 2018 to 2021 is set out in the table below.

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="16.66%"><col width="41.66%"><col width="41.68%"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Year</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total number of scam cases</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Total number of investment scam cases</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2018</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6,189</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">347</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2019</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">9,545</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">487</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2020</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">15,651</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1096</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2021</p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">23,931</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2,476</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

46     As can be seen, the increase in scam cases, in general, and investment scam cases, in particular, is persistent and worrying. In the face of such an increase, judicial concern must be natural and a judicial response would be appropriate. It has been recognised in caselaw that the prevalence of an offence may be a factor that would attract general deterrence. In such cases, “the court will mete out a stiff sentence to show its disapproval and to deter like-minded offenders”: _Law Aik Meng_ (at \[25(a)\]). In my judgment, the increase in scam cases, in general, and investment scam cases, in particular, call for a suitably stiff sentence to be imposed in the present case.

47     In sum, deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle that applies in the present case. In particular, the need for general deterrence is especially pressing in the present case because of the increasing prevalence of investment scam cases.

### Harm

48     Across the 21 charges in total, the total amount cheated by the accused is $1,128,000. The amounts ranged from $9,500 to $220,000. When one considers only the proceeded charges, the amount cheated is $545,000, with amounts ranging from $50,000 to $140,000. However, as stated above, the court, in my view, should be concerned not just with the absolute amount involved but also with the actual harm occasioned. This requires the court to take into account both the sums repaid by the accused post-offence as restitution and the Purported Returns. I am given to understand that the accused made restitution in the total sum of $147,080. The Statement of Facts disclosed that the accused provided Purported Returns in the total sum of $235,000. Taken together, the actual harm occasioned on all four victims is $745,920. The harm suffered by Mr Tan and Mr Ali in relation to the proceeded charges only is $199,000. (A sum of $36,080 was provided to Mr Tan Joon Hwa as restitution but Mr Tan Joon Hwa is not involved in any of the proceeded charges.)

### Culpability

49     Insofar as culpability is concerned, there is no question in my mind that the accused’s crimes were premeditated. The parties disagreed on whether the offences were sophisticated. The difference appears to be more of a matter of degree than kind. There is no doubt that the accused did not merely rely on a glib tongue. He also used other means to persuade and to give the appearance of legitimacy. These include signing investment agreements with both Mr Tan and Mr Ali, providing Mr Tan with dummy accounts with NoaFX and providing the Purported Returns in order to further the facade of legitimacy. Overall, the offences featured a significant level of pre-planning and some level of complexity. The fact that there were four different victims and that the scam was perpetrated over two years (from July 2013 to September 2015) also suggests that there was persistence and commitment to the offending.

### Aggravating and mitigating factors

50     In mitigation, I accept that the accused has demonstrated a degree of genuine remorse. This is notwithstanding that the accused only pleaded guilty one week before the trial was to commence. I do understand that the Prosecution has expanded resources in going through the pre-trial process and preparing for trial. Nevertheless, I regard the accused’s provision of restitution as carrying a degree of mitigating weight. Altogether, the accused provided restitution in the total amount of $147,080. This is not a small, token sum. $80,000 of this sum was paid to Mr Tan between 2105 and 2017. The accused paid Mr Tan Joon Hwa $36,080 at a time not disclosed to me. Between August 2021 and July 2022, the accused paid Mr Ali $31,000. Taken together, the restitution made over such a lengthy period of time is indicative, in my judgment, of genuine remorse.

51     On the other hand, I accord little mitigatory weight to the accused’s lack of antecedents. A lack of antecedents may suggest that an offence may be an aberration and inconsistent with the offender’s general character. If so, a lighter sentence may be appropriate, given the less pressing need for specific deterrence. However, this can hardly be the case when the offender has committed multiple offences over a substantial period of time. In _Chen Weixiong Jerriek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] SGHC 103</span>, the High Court dealt with an offender who pleaded guilty to seven charges with another 38 charges taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The High Court declined to view the offender as a “first offender” and held (at \[15\]) that “the only reason the appellant had no prior convictions was because the law had not yet caught up with him for his past misdeeds”. Similarly, the accused in the present case faces 21 charges, all for the same type of offence. These offences were committed over more than two years. Further, the accused took steps that had the effect of making his crimes less easy to uncover. Taken together, there is no reason to consider his offences as out of character, despite his lack of antecedents. The fact that the accused has no prior criminal record therefore carries no mitigating weight.

52     Turning to aggravating factors, it is aggravating that there are 15 charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The Prosecution also highlighted that there were four victims.

### Sentencing precedents

53     In making submissions on the appropriate sentence to be imposed, parties cited not a few precedents involving offences under section 420 of the Penal Code for consideration. Of these, I place very little weight on the cases of _Public Prosecutor v Ng Kheng Wah and others_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 249</span> (“**_Ng Kheng Wah_**”), _Public Prosecutor v So Seow Tiong_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGDC 203</span> (“**_So Seow Tiong_**”) and _Jennifer Toh._ The cases of _Ng Kheng Wah_ and _So Seow Tiong_ were cases where full restitution of substantial sums of monies was made. It is plain that this factor had a significant influence on the sentences eventually imposed as full restitution meant that the victims suffered little to no actual monetary loss: see _Tan Kheng Wah_ (at \[89\] – \[91\], \[95\] and \[100\]) and _So Seow Tiong_ (at \[27\]). Accordingly, these cases stand on a different footing from the present case where only partial restitution was made. In relation to _Jennifer Toh_, the accused faced four proceeded charges of which only one was for an offence under section 420 of the Penal Code. Further, the single charge for cheating was only for an amount of $1,978, which is far different from the amounts cheated in the present case. Hence, the case of _Jennifer Toh_ is also largely unhelpful for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate sentences to be imposed for the present case.

54     Hence, I rely more heavily on the following cases, which information I set out in a tabular form.

55     As mentioned, it is relevant that the accused has demonstrated remorse but this factor must be assessed against the need to impose a stiff sentence for the purpose of general deterrence and the number of charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

### Conclusion

56     Taking all of the above factors into consideration, I impose the sentences set out at para \[2\].

57     I regard the sentences imposed to be higher than those imposed in _Lim Joe_. For instance, in _Lim Joe_, charges involving amounts of approximately $60,000 and $100,000 attracted sentences of 12 and 15 months’ imprisonment, respectively. In the present case, the 1st charge (involving a sum of $60,000) and the 7th charge (involving a sum of $100,000) attracted sentences of 14 and 18 months’ imprisonment. The reason for this may be explained by three factors – the present case involved a higher total loss, more charges and the heightened need for general deterrence. In this regard, I note that the Court in _Lim Joe_ was not apprised of the exponential rise in scam cases.

58     On the other hand, I regard the sentences imposed in the present case to be lower than the sentences imposed in _Tan Keat Siang_. For instance, charges involving a sum of $50,000 and $100,000 attracted sentences of 16 and 26 months’ imprisonment, respectively, in _Tan Keat Siang_. In the present case, the 15th charge (involving a sum of $50,000) and the 7th charge (involving a sum of $100,000) attracted sentences of 13 and 18 months’ imprisonment. In my view, this is primarily because the actual loss occasioned in _Tan Keat Siang_ was more than twice the loss occasioned in the present case.

## Issue 4: Aggregate sentence

59     I turn to address the final issue which is to impose a fair and proportionate global sentence. In this regard, there are really two steps. The first is to consider which of the sentences should run consecutively. Secondly, the Court should have regard to the totality principle.

### Consecutive or concurrent sentences

60     Generally, sentences for related offences that form part of a single transaction should run concurrently. The High Court explained in _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> that what constitutes a single transaction turns on whether the offences entail a single invasion of the same legally protected interest. The Court explained (at \[39\]) as follows:

> The question of whether the various offences form part of a single transaction in turn depends on whether they entail a “single invasion of the same legally protected interest”… In determining this, the proximities in time, place, continuity of action, and continuity in purpose or design all have utility (at \[28\] and\[34\]). The premise is that if there is a single invasion of a legally protected interest, then even if this might give rise to several offences, it is, in the final analysis, the violation of that single interest that is being punished and concurrent sentences would thus ordinarily suffice to reflect the seriousness of the offences.

61     Parties did not make any submissions on whether the offences set out in the proceeded charges constitute a single invasion of the same legally protected interest and, therefore, a single transaction. In my judgment, there appears to be continuity in purpose and design in respect of the charges. The manner of offending and the ultimate purpose was similar, if not exactly the same. Further, the 3rd and 4th charges also seem to be proximate in terms of time, having been committed from November 2013 to August 2014 and September 2014, respectively. The 15th and 17th charges are also proximate in time as they were both committed in the same month. On the other hand, I am mindful that the proceeded charges involve two different victims and the time of offending was not so proximate in other respects.

62     Ultimately, the one transaction rule is not an inflexible or rigid rule. As was stated in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“**_Mohamed Shouffee_**”) (at \[41\]):

> There may well be circumstances where a sentencing judge may order two sentences to run consecutively even though they are in relation to offences that _do_ form part of a single transaction. One instance of this is where the straightforward application of the one-transaction rule results in the offender benefitting from the court’s failure to have regard to the enhanced culpability that is reflected in the multiplicity of the offences that have been committed.

63     In my judgment, it would not be fair and appropriate to consider all the proceeded charges as a single transaction, even though there was unity of purpose and design. This would ignore the overall culpability of the accused, given the number of charges that has been preferred against him. To consider each charge as a single transaction may also not be fair, given how some offences, on the basis of the Statement of Facts, are barely distinguishable from another, save for the sum delivered by the victims. In my judgment, a fair and appropriate way to approach this issue is to consider the 3rd and 4th charges as a single transaction and the 15th and 17th charges as another single transaction with all the other proceeded charges constituting independent transactions. This would properly account for the gravity of the criminality displayed while not ignoring the proximities that may be found in the charges.

64     On the basis of the above approach, the aggregate sentence, if not further adjusted, would be 74 months’ imprisonment.

### The totality principle

65     The last stage in the analysis is to consider the totality principle and ascertain whether there is any need to adjust either the way the sentences are run or the sentences themselves to ensure that the aggregate sentence is just and proportionate. There are two limbs to the totality principle. The first is to consider whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed: _Mohamed Shouffee_ (at \[54\]). The second is to consider whether the effect of the sentence is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and his future prospects: _Mohamed Shouffee_ (at \[57\]).

66     Having regard to the cases of _Neo Aileen_ and _Tan Keat Siang_, I do not regard a sentence of 74 months’ imprisonment as being substantially above the “normal” level of sentences. As regards the second limb of the totality principle, the Defence submitted that the aggregate sentence may be crushing when compared to cases of _Neo Aileen_ and _Gene Chong_. This may not be the correct understanding of what a crushing sentence means as “\[f\]undamentally, this assessment centres on identifying an aggregate sentence which is _condign_ to the offender’s behaviour and prospects”: _Wong Tian Jun De Beers v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2021\] SGHC 273</span> (at \[68\]) (emphasis in original). In any event, I cannot agree with the Defence’s submission for the foregoing reasons.

67     Counsel argued that the Court in _Neo Aileen_ observed (at \[5\]) that a custodial sentence of between six years (72 months) to 7.5 years (90 months) is appropriate where the total loss is between $830,000 and $1.13 million. However, the present case involves an actual total loss of $745,920. It is for this reason that counsel submitted that the Prosecution’s proposal of an aggregate sentence of 80 months’ imprisonment is too high. There are two points to be made in this regard. The sentencing range observed in _Neo Aileen_ was clearly stated to be “guidelines”. It is therefore entirely possible to depart from those guidelines. In any event, sentencing for such offences is a function not just of the quantum of loss. Other considerations come into play, including the culpability of the offender and the number of charges involved. The case of _Neo Aileen_ only involved two charges which yielded an aggregate sentence of 78 months’ imprisonment. In this light, I am not of the view that an aggregate sentence of 74 months’ imprisonment is too high where there are six proceeded charges and 21 total charges in question.

68     The Defence also relied on the case of _Gene Chong_. In _Gene Chong_, the total loss was approximately $3.2 million and the aggregate sentence was 132 months’ imprisonment. Counsel submitted that “a proportionate reduction in sentence would mean 30 months’ imprisonment”.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3) However, sentences are not derived as an arithmetic function of the quantum of loss. No doubt, the quantum of loss is an important consideration and, generally, the higher the quantum of loss, the more severe the sentence should be. However, the relationship is not a linear one. Further, as mentioned above, other factors are also important.

69     Ultimately, if one were to focus on the offender’s behaviour and prospects, I cannot see why an aggregate sentence of 74 months’ imprisonment (or 6 years and 2 months’ imprisonment) should be considered crushing. In the present case, the accused spent over two years committing cheating offences against four different victims. The total amount cheated was $1,128,000, even if the actual harm caused was eventually reduced to $745,920. The scale and repeated nature of his offending suggests to me that a custodial term of 74 months is fair and appropriate relative to the criminality displayed. The accused is presently aged 51 years. He should complete his sentence well before he is 60 years old. There is no reason to think that the aggregate sentence is not in keeping with his future prospects.

## Conclusion

70     For the reasons set out above, I impose the sentences set out at para \[2\], above. The aggregate sentence is 74 months’ imprisonment.

[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1_1)The Statement of Facts (at \[17\]) states $350,000 but this appears to be incorrect.

[^2]: Generally, the statistics for the total number of scam cases and the total number of investment scam cases differ slightly from one report to the report in the following year. For instance, in relation to the total number of scam cases for 2019, there is a slight discrepancy between the 2019 report and the 2020 report. The 2019 report stated (at para 7) that the number is 9,502. The 2020 report (at para 6) stated that the number is 9,545. For present purposes, I have used the figure released later in time as the statistics in the later report may have been adjusted for accuracy after the release of the earlier report.

[^3]: Mitigation plea at para \[48\].
