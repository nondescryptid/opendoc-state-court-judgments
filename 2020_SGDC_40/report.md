### District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt:

## Introduction

The accused, a 43 year-old female South Korean permanent resident, was so drunk when she got home at 3.30 am in a private-hire car that she refused to leave the car. The police were called to the scene to assist. She was woken up and escorted back to her apartment, all the while hurling vulgarities at the police officers. When the police tried to open the front door of her apartment, she bit the finger of one of the police officers. The accused was charged for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt to the police officer under s 332 of the Penal Code. She pleaded guilty to the charge. A second charge for drunken behaviour and causing annoyance was taken into consideration. The accused was sentenced 15 weeks’ imprisonment. She appealed against the sentence which has been stayed.

## Charges

2       The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge:

> You…are charged that you on the 14th of February 2019, at or about 4.03 a.m., outside unit #XXX of “Cradles” Condominium, located at Blk 10 Lorong Limau, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Lam Sok Hwa, Tryphena (Lin Shuhua), a Sergeant of the Singapore Police Force, a public servant in the discharge of her duty as such public servant, to wit, by biting the right 5th finger of the said Sergeant Lam Sok Hwa, Tryphena (Lin Shuhua) and causing bodily pain to her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 332 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224. (Rev. Ed. 2008).

3       The accused further admitted and consented to a second charge[^1] of drunken behaviour and causing annoyance to the private-hire driver under s 14(2)(i) of the Liquor Control (Supply and Consumption) Act, to be taken into consideration (“TIC”) for sentencing.

4       The accused was sentenced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

## Statement of Facts

5       The accused admitted to the following statement of facts (“SOF”) presented by the prosecution without qualification.

> 1.    The accused is Song Soo Jin, a 43-year-old female with NRIC: XXX. She is a Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) and a South Korean Citizen.

> 2.    The victim is Sergeant Lam Sok Hwa Typhena (Lin Shuhua), Female, 31 years old. At the material time, the victim was performing patrol duties as a Voluntary Special Constable attached to Kampong Java Neighborhood Police Centre.

> First Information Report

> 3.    On the 14th of February 2019, at about 3.39 a.m., the police received a call reporting the following: “Female passenger drunk and unable to wake up.” The location provided was “Cradles” condominium (“the condominium”), located at Blk 10 Lorong Limau, Singapore 328754.

> Facts relating to the 1st Charge

> 4.    On 14th February 2019, at about 3.00 a.m., the accused took a Grab taxi car to her condominium, “Cradles”, located at Blk 10 Lorong Limau. The accused was heavily intoxicated as she had been consuming alcoholic drinks with her clients throughout the night, from 9 p.m. onwards. During the ride to the condominium, the accused fell asleep inside the Grab car.

> 5.    When the Grab car arrived outside the condominium’s guardhouse, the driver tried to wake the accused up, but the accused remained unresponsive. The driver then called for police assistance.

> 6.    The victim and another Police Officer, Muhammad Farhan bin Sarman, were dispatched from Kampong Java NPC and arrived at the incident location at around 3.45 a.m. Together, they managed to wake the accused up and were able to ascertain the accused’s address after conducting a check on her belongings. Thereafter, they escorted the accused to her residential unit #XXX in the condominium, but discovered that the unit was locked.

> 7.    At the corridor outside unit #XXX, the Police officers repeatedly asked the accused to unlock her unit door, but the accused refused. Instead, she took out two $50 notes from her wallet and sat on the floor. During this time, the accused was also verbally incoherent and was uttering vulgarities in Korean language. The victim then managed to find the unit key inside the accused’s bag, and attempted to unlock the unit door.

> 8.    In response, the accused grabbed the victim’s right hand and bit the victim’s right 5th finger, with the intention to deter the victim from discharging her duty as a public servant. The victim managed to dislodge her hand, and proceeded to escort the accused into the unit.

> 9.    The victim sought medical treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and was assessed by Dr Roy Heng Jian Xiong on 14 February 2019 to have suffered a small break in the skin over the right 5th finger without any active bleeding. The victim’s fingers and hand were found neurovascularly intact.

## Prescribed Punishment

6       The present offence under s 332 of the Penal Code is punishable with imprisonment up to 7 years, or with fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments. It is a serious offence in view of the severe maximum jail sentence and the provision of the liability to caning.

## General and Specific Deterrence

7       The public interest to protect police officers in the discharge of their duty was affirmed by the High Court of three Judges in _PP v Yeo Ek Boon Jeffrey_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 306</span> (“_Jeffrey Yeo_”). The court stated at \[50\] in no uncertain terms that police officers had to be assured of adequate protection and vindication by the law against behaviour that might compromise the effective discharge of their duties. The court noted a sentencing trend which showed that for any assault against a police or law enforcement officer, a custodial sentence was the norm and the usual sentence would be around two to nine months’ imprisonment.[^2] The court went on to formulate a sentencing framework for a s 332 Penal Code offence so as to reflect society’s opprobrium of offences against police officers.[^3] The framework applies also to other law enforcement officers who perform similar policing functions. Under the framework, the lowest category (i.e. Category 1) is stated to encompass the then existing sentencing norm of a custodial sentence of two to nine months’ imprisonment, which would remain the indicative starting point (the “_Cat 1 scale_”). The court cautioned that fines should be meted out only in very exceptional cases, where the offending act ranked the lowest in the harm-and-culpability spectrum. The court suggested that this sentencing option should generally be available only to young offenders or offenders with some mental disorder. It was not in dispute that neither of these two traits were relevant to the present accused.

8       The prosecution and counsel for the defence agree that the Cat 1 scale applies in the present case. The defence therefore would not disagree that there is a strong public interest to protect police officers from abuse by the very members of the public whom the officers selflessly serve and protect when discharging their police duties. Compared to other public officers, police officers are especially vulnerable and exposed to unreasonable, unruly and even violent members of the public. When police officers go about their policing duties, they must be able to discharge their duties without fear or favour. Therefore, it is imperative for the courts to do our part to protect our police officers by adequately punishing offenders and effectively deterring would-be offenders who assault and abuse police officers when they execute their public duties. A weak and insufficient sentence would not only fail to send a clear deterrent signal to would-be offenders but would lessen the moral and legal authority that police officers must be empowered in order to effectively perform their functions.

9       Further, I was of the view that the sentencing principle of specific deterrence (as explained in _PP v Law Aik Meng_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 2 SLR(R) 814</span>) would also be a relevant consideration in this case in view of the animalistic nature of the assault on the police officer. The sentences imposed in the precedents cited by the prosecution would bear testament to this consideration. The prosecution also informed that the officer had to undergo tests to determine if any infectious diseases had been transmitted to her as a result of the bite which broke her skin. She was also given immunisation injections. Therefore, in addition to bodily pain, the officer would also have suffered a period of anxiety pending the results of the tests. This psychological trauma caused to the victim was conceded by counsel for the accused.[^4]

## Parties’ Submission on Sentence

#### DPP’s Submission

10     The prosecution sought a sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment, highlighting the aggravating features of the case including the fact that the accused was intoxicated and that she also admitted to the TIC charge for drunken behaviour and causing annoyance to the private-hire driver. It was acknowledged by counsel that the accused was in fact “_drunk, vulgar and a nuisance_.”[^5]

11     The prosecution also tendered a list of 21 sentencing precedents of cases of offenders biting police officers in the course of their duties.[^6] These “biting cases” were decided post-_Jeffrey Yeo._

12     The learned DPP pointed out that in all but three of the 21 cases, the offender was sentenced to at least four months’ imprisonment. The norm was between 5-6 months’ imprisonment. The three outliers were:

> (i)      _PP v Don Lai Huan Wen_ (DAC-932755-2017) where the offender was sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment for biting the officer on the wrist;

> (ii)      _PP v Annadurai Nallathambi_ (DAC-932813-2018) where the offender was sentenced to three months for biting the officer’s bicep; and

> (iii)      _PP v Wan Li_ (MA 9355-2018) where the offender was sentenced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment for biting the officer’s tricep.

13     The prosecution pointed out and I agreed that the first case, _PP v Don Lai Huan Wen_, was indeed an outlier and very much distinguishable because the offender suffered from mild intellectual disability and epilepsy. The offender’s intellectual disability and medical condition were likely to been given considerable weight by the sentencing court. The sentences imposed in respect of the second and third cases were not really that far apart and also not significantly lower than what the prosecution was submitting (i.e. four months) in the present case. I considered that the present case was not any more serious or aggravating than the third precedent in _PP v Wan Li_. In that case, the offender (also a foreign national) was suicidal and escorted by the police to IMH for observation. He struggled when the officers tried to restrain him on the hospital bed and he bit one of the officers on the left tri-cep. The bite left teeth marks, with erythema and swelling. There did not appear to be any break in the skin. The prosecution appealed against the sentence of 15 weeks’ imprisonment but the sentence was upheld by the High Court on appeal. As such, I was of the view that a sentence of not more than 15 weeks’ imprisonment would likewise be reasonable and appropriate in this case, in the absence of any countervailing and compelling mitigating circumstances.

#### Counsel’s Submission

14     In his written[^7] and oral submissions, counsel for the accused asked that the accused be sentenced to only two months’ imprisonment i.e. at the lowest point of the Cat 1 scale. Counsel was aggrieved that the prosecution’s earlier sentencing position was only two months’ imprisonment but had subsequently revised that position upwards to four months’ imprisonment. I told counsel that there was nothing to prohibit the prosecution to review and revise its sentencing submission and position before the sentence was passed. I understand that prosecution’s original sentencing position was large based on precedents that pre-dated _Jeffrey Yeo_. In any event, I confirmed with counsel that he was aware of the prosecution’s revised sentencing position and had also taken the accused’s instructions. Therefore, counsel was not taken by surprise by the change in sentencing position, at least not at the material time of the plea of guilt. I was satisfied that the accused was prepared to plead guilty to the charge with full knowledge of and notwithstanding the revised sentencing position.

15     Counsel also lamented that the prosecution had offered, on condition of a plea of guilt, to reduce the charge to a lesser one of using criminal force against a public servant under s 353 of the Penal Code. Counsel informed that the prosecution agreed to reduce the charge in November 2019.[^8] However, it would appear that the offer was withdrawn and the charge reverted to the present charge in December 2019. I should point out that the charge on the court’s (ICMS) records has always been one under s 332 of the Penal Code. In any event, counsel’s expressed grievance was neither here nor there. Article 35(8) of the Constitution unequivocally states that “_\[t\]he Attorney-General shall have power exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence_.” Therefore, the DPP, representing the Attorney-General (“AG”), has conduct of the prosecution and the prerogative and full discretion to prefer the appropriate charge against an accused. Given the constitutional status of the AG and in exercising his prosecutorial power, the AG (represented by the DPP) is presumed to have acted in accordance with the law and in the public interest (see _Ramalingam Ravinthran v AG_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGCA 2</span> at \[46\]).

16     I also noted that when the accused was first charged in July 2019, the charge was already for the present offence under s 332 of the Penal Code. This was certainly not the case that the charge was amended only on the day of the plead-guilty mention before this court. Even if it was, it would have been entirely up to the accused, on the advice of counsel, to decide whether to admit or contest the charge. There was also no question that the SOF did not support the charge. I was satisfied that the SOF absolutely bore out all the ingredients of the charge as framed.

## No Significant Mitigating Factors

17     In mitigation, counsel stressed that the accused was remorseful and had pleaded guilty to the charge. It was also stressed that the accused was a first offender, had acted out of character and that it was a one-off incident. A number of testimonials from business associates and were tendered to the court. The relevance of some of these factors was clarified by Menon CJ in _Stansilas Fabian Kester v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 185</span> at \[99\]. Menon CJ pointed out that an offender’s good character and good works might suggest that the commission of the offence is an aberration and is unlikely to reoccur. As such, these factors would lessen the need for specific deterrence. However, Menon CJ went on to observe at \[100\] that the principle of deterrence principle has a second aspect which is that of _general_ deterrence i.e. to educate and deter other like-minded members of the general public by making an example of the particular offender. The mitigating value, if any, of past contributions will be readily displaced and offset by the interest of general deterrence.

18     I also reminded counsel that these factors (i.e. plea of guilt, remorse, clean record) would already have been factored into the Cat 1 scale. In other words, these factors would not merit a further reduction within the Cat 1 scale. Counsel also argued that there were no aggravating factors in this case and that the injury (i.e. break in the skin of the finger) was minor and therefore the harm caused was low. Counsel had perhaps forgotten that the hurt caused was not merely the break in skin but also the sharp bodily pain which the victim would have felt, as stated in the charge. I was prepared to accept that the injury was relatively minor and that the harm caused was correspondingly low. However, it is trite law that an absence of aggravating factors does not in itself constitute a mitigating factor.

19     In any event, counsel’s submission that there were no aggravating factors was incorrect because at the very least, as was held in _Jeffrey Yeo_, the fact that the accused was intoxicated was an aggravating factor. The same view was expressed in _Wong Hoi Len v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] 1 SLR(R) 115</span> at \[44\] that the court “_should ordinarily take into account an offender’s intoxication as an aggravating consideration_” and that “\[t\]_hose who voluntarily imbibe alcohol must, in the usual course of events, take full responsibility for their subsequent offending_.”

20     I must also stress that over and above the aggravating factor of intoxication, there was the additional consideration of the TIC charge which involved causing annoyance to the private-hire driver (and no doubt to all present at the scene including the security guards at the condominium) because of the accused’s intoxication.

21     Counsel further submitted that the accused only behaved in the alleged manner because she merely reacted to the police officer trying to open the door to her apartment.[^9] In other words, she misread the officer’s intentions. I did not accept this to be a mitigating factor at all, let alone a compelling one. The officer in this case was only discharging her duty as a police officer to escort the accused safely back into her apartment. It cannot lie in the mouth of the accused to assert that she was only reacting in response to what she perceived the police officer to be doing, when (i) the officer was merely discharging her duty and (ii) the accused’s reaction was violent and wholly disproportionate.

22     In any case, the SOF which the accused admitted without qualification, contradicted and negated counsel’s argument. The facts, as admitted, state that the accused refused to open her front door and verbally abused the police with vulgarities. When the officer found the key and tried to open the door, the facts state clearly at \[8\] that the accused then bit the police officer’s finger “_with the intention to deter the victim from discharging her duty as a public servant_.” There was therefore clear malice and mischief on the part of the accused in biting the police officer. Her act was not as innocent and instinctive as painted by counsel.

23     Finally, I also did not view any of the personal circumstances canvassed by counsel as being mitigating, let alone exceptional. Ultimately, these circumstances had no bearing on the charge and the accused’s overall culpability.

## Conclusion

24     For all the reasons set out above, the accused was sentenced to 15 weeks’ imprisonment.

25     I considered that the length of the imprisonment sentence was both appropriate and not in the least disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the moral and legal culpability of the accused, and when weighed against all the facts and circumstances of the case.

26     In conclusion, the principles of general and specific deterrence, underpinned by the public interest to protect police officers in the discharge of their public functions, are applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. These sentencing considerations far outweighed the personal circumstances of the accused. Given the specific nature of the assault and the absence of exceptional mitigating factors, a custodial sentence higher up the Cat 1 scale was appropriate and justified.
