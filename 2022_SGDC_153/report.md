### District Judge Kessler Soh:

## Introduction

1       Mohammad Badri Bilal Bin Mohideen (“**Badri**”) is 19 years of age. On 22 August 2021, when he was 18 years old, and about 1½ months after his release from the Reformative Training Centre under a supervision order for prior offences, he and 14 other individuals were gathered at the void deck of a block of flats at Jurong West for a social gathering, in contravention of COVID-19 regulations. They were reported to be drinking alcohol and smoking, and causing nuisance in a public place. When police officers arrived to investigate, Badri was uncooperative and hostile. He pushed, grabbed and shoved a police officer, and uttered abusive words against the officer, and resisted arrest.

2       He was subsequently charged with three charges of using criminal force against the police officer, under s 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“**Penal Code**”); one charge of using abusive words towards the police officer, an offence under s 6(1)(a) and punishable under s 6(3) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A) (“**PFHA**”); and one charge of contravening COVID-19 regulations.

3       On 18 March 2022, he pleaded guilty to three charges, with the remaining charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. A pre-sentence report was called to assess his suitability to undergo reformative training. He was due to return to court on 6 May 2022, but failed to do so. Neither he nor his surety were contactable. Meanwhile, he was wanted by the police for investigations into a fresh offence. A warrant was thus issued for his arrest. He was arrested, and brought before me again on 31 May 2022. The matter was adjourned pending the completion of the reformative training pre-sentence report.

4       On 22 June 2022, Badri was sentenced to undergo reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 12 months, in line with the recommendations in the pre-sentence report. Badri, who had asked to be sentenced to imprisonment instead of reformative training, filed the present appeal against the sentence on 28 June 2022.

5       The grounds of my decision on the sentence are set out below.

## Plea of Guilt

### Proceeded charges

6       Badri pleaded guilty to three charges:

> DAC-916146-2021

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 22 August 2021, at or about 4.17pm, at Apt Blk 622 Jurong West Street 61, Singapore, did use criminal force to a public servant, Sgt (3) Wu Jialei (“Sgt Wu”), a police officer, with the intent to prevent Sgt Wu from discharging his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by using your hand to push Sgt Wu’s hand away, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> DAC-901278-2022

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 22 August 2021, at or about 4.18pm, at Apt Blk 622 Jurong West Street 61 Singapore, did use criminal force to a public servant, Sgt (3) Wu Jialei (“Sgt Wu”), a police officer, with the intent to prevent Sgt Wu from discharging his duty as such public servant, _to wit_, by grabbing Sgt Wu’s wrist and spreading both arms to prevent him from getting close to Praveen Nivash Velmurugan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 353 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed).

> MAC-900710-2022

> You \[…\] are charged that you, on 22 August 2021, at or about 4.20pm, at Blk 622 Jurong West Street 61, Singapore, did use abusive words towards Sgt(3) Wu Jialei, a Police officer who was a public servant, _to wit_, by uttering to him in the Hokkien dialect, “_ci bai_” (which means “cunt” in the English language), in relation to the execution of his duty as a public servant, and you have thereby committed an offence under Section 6(1)(a) of the Protection from Harassment Act, Chapter 256A, punishable under Section 6(3) of the same Act.

7       Section 353 of the Penal Code:

> Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person in the lawful discharge of his duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 4 years, or with fine, or with both.

8       Section 6(1)(a) and 6(3) of the PFHA:

> (1)    No person shall by any means —

>> (a)    use any indecent, threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour; \[…\]

> towards or to a public servant or public service worker (referred to for the purposes of this section as the victim) in relation to the execution of the victim’s duty as such public servant or public service worker.

> \[…\]

> (3)    Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and, subject to section 8, shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.

### Facts

9       These were the salient facts.

10     On 22 August 2021, at about 3.56 pm, the police received a call reporting, “There is about 15 people here smoking and drinking causing nuisance. Can ask the Police call me when they arrive here.” The incident location given was Block 622 Jurong West Street 61, Jurong West, Singapore. Following the call, a few police officers were despatched to the location.

11     At about 4.12 pm, two police officers arrived at the location. The officers were Sgt (3) Wu Jialei (“**Sgt Wu**”) and Police National Serviceman Muhammad Isa Bin Bahar (“**PNSF Isa**”). The officers saw Badri and one “Praveen” together with 13 other men, seated at two tables at the void deck. Several cans of beer were on the tables. Praveen and Badri had arranged to meet up with various persons at the void deck for a social gathering to drink alcohol.

12     The officers approached the persons at the gathering and obtained their personal particulars. When Sgt Wu requested for Praveen’s particulars, Praveen started to walk away, telling Sgt Wu that he had already provided his particulars to PNSF Isa. Sgt Wu asked PNSF Isa if Praveen’s particulars had been produced, and PNSF Isa replied in the negative.

13     At about 4.17 pm, Sgt Wu followed after Praveen and requested for his particulars again. At this point, Badri intervened and stood in front of Praveen to prevent the officers from approaching Praveen. Badri pushed Sgt Wu’s hand away, with the intent to prevent him from discharging his duty (_DAC-916146-2021_). Badri said, “Don’t touch my friend” and insisted that Praveen had provided his particulars.

14     At about 4.18 pm, while the officers were speaking to Badri, Praveen took the opportunity to escape from the scene. Badri grabbed Sgt Wu’s wrist and spread both of his arms to prevent Sgt Wu from getting close to Praveen (_DAC-901278-2022_). Sgt Wu managed to chase after Praveen and detain him.

15     At about 4.19 pm, Badri started raising his voice at Sgt Wu. Sgt Wu held onto Badri’s arm, and Badri used his right hand to grab Sgt Wu’s right arm, before shoving Sgt Wu away, with the intent to prevent him from discharging his duty.

16     At about 4.20 pm, Badri stood between Sgt Wu and Praveen. He pushed Sgt Wu’s hand away, saying “I already give you respect” and uttering “_ci bai_” (a Hokkien vulgarity meaning “_cunt_” in English) (_MAC-900710-2022_). These words were uttered in relation to Sgt Wu’s execution of his duty. Sgt Wu held onto Badri’s hand, but Badri swung his hand away.

17     Praveen managed to break free from Sgt Wu and fled again. He fell after a short distance and was detained by Sgt Wu and PNSF Isa.

18     At about 4.22 pm, two other police officers arrived at the location, and they arrested Badri.

## Sentencing

### Charges taken into consideration

19     Two charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. The salient details of these offences were as follows:

> (a)     At about 4.19 pm on the day of the incident, he used criminal force by grabbing Sgt Wu’s right arm with his right hand and shoving him away (facts above, at \[15\]), an offence punishable under s 353 of the Penal Code. (DAC-901556-2022)

> (b)     At about 4.00 pm that day, without reasonable excuse, he gathered with 14 other individuals outside his ordinary place of residence for a social gathering, in contravention of Reg 6(1) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, an offence punishable under s 34(7)(a) of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020. (MAC-900711-2022)

### Antecedents

20     The criminal records of Badri showed that he was, on 28 February 2017, ordered by the Youth Court to undergo probation for 24 months for various offences: theft, mischief, being armed with a dangerous or offensive instrument, theft of motor vehicle or component part (8 counts), driving a motor vehicle while below the age of 18 years, and driving without insurance coverage. He breached the conditions of probation and was sentenced to reformative training on 11 September 2018.

### Calling of pre-sentence report

21     In a brief oral submission, the prosecution urged the court to call for a pre-sentence report to assess Badri’s suitability for reformative training. It was pointed out that he had previously been sentenced to probation and reformative training and yet reoffended, and that specific deterrence ought to apply. Badri did not mitigate, but requested for a “penal sentence” (meaning, a term of imprisonment), saying that he never really changed while undergoing reformative training.

22     I accepted the submission of the prosecution that a pre-sentence report for reformative training ought to be called. Badri was young, and rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration. At the same time, there was a need for specific deterrence given his past offences, breach of probation conditions, and reoffending despite having been sentenced to reformative training. Indeed, his present offences (on 22 August 2021) were committed only about 1½ months after his release from the Reformative Training Centre (on 7 July 2021) under a supervision order.[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) The sentencing considerations of rehabilitation and specific deterrence could both be met in a sentence of reformative training. (Probation was not a viable sentencing option, considering that Badri had breached his probation conditions before, and it had very limited deterrent effect as a sentencing option.)

### Suitable to undergo reformative training

23     The preparation of the pre-sentence report, which ordinarily would have taken about three weeks, was delayed. Badri was required to undergo an IQ test at the Institute of Mental Health, but failed to do so on the scheduled date. The IQ test was then rescheduled to a later date (on 13 May 2022). A court mention was scheduled on 6 May 2022 to impress upon him the need to attend the test, but Badri did not attend the court mention. The prosecution reported that Badri was wanted by the police for investigations into a fresh offence. A warrant for his arrest was thus issued to secure his attendance. He was arrested about two weeks later, on 19 May 2022. The matter was mentioned before me again on 31 May 2022, and adjourned to 22 June 2022 to allow time for the pre-sentence report to be completed.

24     In the _Pre-Sentencing Report for Reformative Training_, dated 17 June 2022 (the “**RT Report**”), Badri was found to be physically and mentally suitable to undergo the reformative training regime. It was observed in the report that Badri “presented with a persistent pattern of offending with a history of failures to comply with supervision conditions”:

> Supporting documents indicated Badri’s first brushes with the law started in 2015 with two one-year conditional warnings by the police for trespassing, housebreaking and theft in dwelling. In February 2017, Badri was ordered to 24 months split probation for multiple theft offences, mischief and possession of housebreaking implements or offensive weapons. Breach action was taken against him three times in 2017 due to poor progress on probation, where he breached time restrictions, failed to return to Boys’ Town (BT) and failed to attend school, amongst other infractions. As a result, he was ordered to reside in SBH \[Singapore Boys’ Home\] for a period of 24 months in November 2017. In August 2018, SBH took breach action against Badri for his involvement in mass unruly behaviour in SBH. It was his second involvement in such an event, following an earlier incident in July 2018. In September 2018, Badri was sentenced to Reformative Training.

> Overall, Badri’s progress in RTC has been inconsistent. He committed eight major and seven minor institutional offences from December 2018 to February 2022, including several offences of defiance towards staff and a fight with another inmate. He managed to sustain a period of positive behavioural progress from March 2020 and was found suitable and placed on his first ROS \[Release on Supervision\] in September 2020. However, his progress on ROS was poor, with multiple curfew violations and failure to appear for reporting sessions. He cut his electronic monitoring tag on 8 October 2020 following an argument with his mother and was arrested two weeks later.

> Badri was placed on his second ROS in July 2021 and showed better compliance towards supervision conditions. However, based on email inputs from his ROS officers, there was difficulty confirming his employment status and movement during work, as no employment letter was produced and the work supervisor was unresponsive. In August 2021, the day he committed his current offences, Badri was supposed to be attending a job interview for a new job. He was subsequently arrested and recalled the next day for the current offences.

> Badri was placed on his third ROS in February 2022, after bail was posted for him by his aunt. He had multiple curfew violations from early April onwards, eventually cut his electronic monitoring tag and remained unresponsive to his ROS officers’ attempts to contact him approximately a week later. Due to his repeated breaches of both ROS and court curfews, and unknown whereabouts, Badri was recommended for immediate recall to RTC and eventually apprehended by the police in end May 2022. Badri’s account in the latest interview in June 2022 indicated he committed offences during his latest ROS period, and these contributed to his decision to cut his tag.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)

25     Having assessed his various criminogenic needs domains, such as his family, lack of engagement in education and employment, antisocial peers, alcohol and drug problems, unconstructive use of leisure time, personality and behaviour, antisocial attitudes, the report concluded that:

> \[Badri\] presented with multiple needs that require intervention, namely in the areas of continued acceptance of the use of violence, alcohol consumption, and association with negative peers. He would also benefit from enhancing his employability through undertaking vocational qualifications and expanding his social circle through exploring various prosocial leisure activities, such as soccer. It would also be helpful for Badri and his family to receive community support in the areas of parenting and supervision skills.[\[note: 3\]](#Ftn_3)

26     The report went on to recommend that he underwent “Level 2 intensity of rehabilitation” if sentenced to reformative training.

### Sentence imposed

27     The prosecution submitted that Badri ought to be sentenced to reformative training at the recommended intensity. Badri maintained that he wished to be sentenced to imprisonment, saying that he did not benefit from reformative training.

28     In my judgment, reformative training was the most appropriate sentencing option. Badri was under 21 years of age; being a young offender, rehabilitation remained the dominant sentencing consideration. His persistent offending was also clearly indicative of the need for specific deterrence. The twin needs of rehabilitation and specific deterrence could be met in a sentence of reformative training.

29     I was not persuaded by Badri’s plea to be sentenced to imprisonment instead of reformative training. Despite his history of offending and breaching supervision conditions, rehabilitation remained a dominant sentencing consideration. His rehabilitation would be better served by reformative training, where the interventions and correctional programmes could be adapted to address his criminogenic needs.[\[note: 4\]](#Ftn_4) In any case, his personal preference on the type of punishment was not a relevant sentencing consideration. As was stated by the High Court in _Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 334</span> at \[64\], courts should not “place the offender in the position where he is able to simply pick and choose the terms on which he would like to be rehabilitated.”

30     All in, I was satisfied, having regard to Badri’s character, previous offending conduct and the circumstances of the present offences, that to reform him and to prevent him from committing further crime, he should undergo reformative training. Accordingly, I imposed a sentence of reformative training with a minimum period of detention of 12 months, in accordance with the recommendations in the RT Report.

31     The sentence took effect from the date on which the sentence was passed, on 22 June 2022. He is presently serving the sentence.
