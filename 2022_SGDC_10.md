\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9291/2021/01.\]

11 January 2022

### District Judge Kevin Kwek:

## Introduction

1       On 28 October 2021, the accused pleaded guilty to ten charges. The proceeded charges related to the accused’s unauthorised consumption and possession of methamphetamine; his failure to report for a urine test; for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by using a weapon likely to cause death; for cheating by personation; and for committing a variety of traffic-related offences. 39 other charges were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence (individually, “**TIC Charge**”; collectively, the “**TIC Charges**”).

2       After convicting the accused of the ten charges on 28 October 2021, the hearing was adjourned for parties to submit on the appropriate sentence for the individual offences and for further submissions to be made on the totality principle given the number of charges that the accused faced.[^1]

3       The parties’ global sentencing positions were as follows.

> (a)     Prosecution: nine years’ and eight months’ imprisonment, nine strokes of the cane, a fine of $3,600 and for the accused to be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences (“**DQ Order**”) for a period of 12 months.

> (b)     Defence: seven years’ and ten months’ imprisonment, seven strokes of the cane, a fine of $3,000 and a DQ Order of 12 months.

4       The prosecution and defence confirmed at the hearing on 16 December 2021 that the parties’ individual sentencing position for most of the proceeded charges did not differ substantially and that there were only two primary areas of dispute:[^2]

> (a)     The appropriate sentence for the charge in relation to voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a victim by using a weapon likely to cause death.

> (b)     Whether the aggregate sentence imposed was in line with the totality principle.

5       After considering the parties’ submissions on 16 December 2021, I imposed a sentence of eight years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment, nine strokes of the cane and a fine of $3,600 (in default ten days’ imprisonment). Two of the traffic offences warranted DQ Orders and I ordered one DQ Order of 12 months to take effect from the date of conviction _ie_, 28 October 2021, and the other DQ Order of 12 months to take effect from the date of sentence _ie_, 16 December 2021.

6       The commencement of the imprisonment term was backdated to 23 August 2018 (_ie_, the date on which the accused was arrested) and to take into account the periods in which the accused was in remand and to exclude the periods where the accused was not in remand. The accused was not in remand from 27 October 2018 to 05 March 2019.

7       The accused appealed the decision on 28 December 2021 and I set out my full grounds of decision below.

### The charges

The accused also admitted to the 39 TIC Charges and consented to have them taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence. Separately, the prosecution applied for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal in relation to an offence of attempted possession of diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking and this was granted by the court on 16 December 2021. A summary of the TIC Charges is set out in **Annex 1**.

### Facts

10     The statement of facts dated 28 October 2021(the “**SOF**”) was read out in court to which the accused admitted to without qualification.

11     The material facts from the SOF is set out below.

> 1.    The accused is Chee Wei Jie, Joseph.

> **FACTS RELATING TO DAC-929093**

> 2.    The Victim is a 44-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, the Victim and the accused were close friends, with the Victim financially supporting the accused. The accused and the Victim resided together at a rental unit from May 2018 (the “**Unit**”).

> 3.    On 17 August 2018, sometime after 9.00 pm, the accused returned to the Unit with a male friend. The accused thereafter left the Unit around 5.00 am on 18 August 2018. At about 7.00 am, the Victim and accused had an argument over text messages as the Victim was upset with the accused and wanted to end their friendship. The Victim left the Unit thereafter.

> 4.    Later on 18 August 2018, the Victim returned to the Unit at about 11.00 pm. When he arrived at the Unit, the accused confronted him at the door and placed the pointed edge of a parang knife on the left of the Victim’s neck. The accused asked the Victim where he had gone. The accused and Victim then got into a verbal dispute, during which the accused pointed the parang at the Victim and told the Victim to stop talking about his friend. The accused and Victim also argued about the accused’s refusal to be intimate with the Victim, and the Victim’s HIV positive status. After about 10 minutes, the accused and the Victim calmed down and proceeded into the Unit. The Victim then went into the bedroom and fell asleep.

> 5.    On 19 August 2018, at about 4.00 am, the Victim woke up and decided to check on the accused as he saw that the accused was not in the bedroom. The Victim then realised that his wallet, NRIC and laptop were missing. The Victim started panicking after he was unable to open the bedroom door as he assumed that it had been locked. The Victim proceeded to kick the bedroom door while shouting the accused’s name and accusing him of locking the door. There was no reply from the accused.

> 6.    Shortly thereafter, the accused opened the bedroom door while the Victim was still standing behind the said door in the bedroom. The accused then stabbed the Victim in the abdomen area once with a parang knife (blade measuring about 34 cm and handle about 14 cm). The Victim fell onto the bed in pain. The Victim then asked the accused to call for an ambulance. After doing so, the accused left the Unit with, inter alia, the parang knife that he had used to stab the Victim and two other parang knives.

> 7.    The Victim was conveyed to Singapore General Hospital and found to have sustained a penetrating injury in his abdomen, with his abdominal content eviscerating through the wound. According to the medical report dated 6 December 2018 prepared by Dr Jeremy Ng Chung Fai, Senior Consultant of the Department of General Surgery, an operation was thereafter conducted on the Victim. The Victim was noted to have penetrating injuries to his small bowel, and a small segment of this was removed during the operation. The Victim made a recovery from the surgery and was discharged. He was given 27 days’ hospitalisation leave from 19 August 2018 to 14 September 2018.

> 8.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under section 326 of the PC.

> **FACTS RELATING TO DAC-906140, DAC-906141, DAC-906142 and DAC-906143**

> 9.    On 10 January 2019, at about 8.40am, the accused was driving a motorcar bearing registration number SMD1151R (the “**Car**”) along Bedok Road near to Jalan Bilal, Singapore. The accused drove the Car without due care and attention, and failed to maintain proper control of the Car. As a result, the Car collided onto the centre divider, mounted the road kerb and overturned on the road. After the accident, the accused fled the scene by foot and abandoned the Car at the spot where it lay overturned.

> 10.    At the material time, the weather was fine, traffic flow was light, road surface was dry and visibility was good.

> 11.    Investigations revealed that while the accused was driving the Car, he was not a qualified licence holder of a Singapore Class 3 driving licence that authorises him to drive a motor vehicle of that class. The Licensing Officer of the Traffic Police confirmed that the accused was not in possession of any valid Class 3 driving licence at the material time. Further, at the material time, there was no policy of insurance or security in respect of third party risks that complies with the requirements of the MVA in relation to the use of the Car by the accused.

> 12.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed the following four offences: a. inconsiderate driving under section 65(a) of the RTA; b. driving without a valid licence under section 35(1) of the RTA; c. using a vehicle without insurance coverage under section 3(1), punishable under sections 3(2) and 3(3) of the MVA; and d. failing to stop after an accident under section 84(1) of the RTA.

> **FACTS RELATING TO DAC-908686**

> 13.    The accused was placed under compulsory supervision from 28 July 2017 to 27 July 2019 for a period of 24 months by virtue of regulation 15 of the MDR.

> 14.    Pursuant to regulation 15(3)(f) of the MDR, the accused was required to present himself at Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters on every Monday and Friday of each month (commencing on 31 July 2017) for urine tests during the period of supervision.

> 15.    The accused contravened the said regulation when he failed to present himself for a urine test on 4 March 2019. The accused had not been reporting for urine tests since October 2018 as he was consuming “Ice” (street name for methamphetamine) and knew that his urine would test positive for controlled drugs. The accused did not have any valid reason for his failure to report for a urine test on 4 March 2019.

> 16.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under Reg 15(3)(f), punishable under Reg 15(6)(a) of the MDR.

> 17.    On 5 March 2019 at about 10.26pm, the accused was arrested by a party of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau at Blk 38 Upper Boon Keng Road. A search was conducted on the accused and the following items were recovered and seized as case exhibits: a. one packet containing crystalline substance (later marked as B1A1); and b. one improvised pipe and one straw (later marked as B1B1).

> 18.    On 6 March 2019, the exhibit marked B1A1 was submitted to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) in a tamper-proof bag for analysis.

> 19.    On 28 June 2019, Merula Mangudi, an analyst with the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of HSA, after having conducted the analysis in relation to the said exhibit, issued a certificate under section 16 of the MDA bearing Lab No. ID-1932-00450-003 which states that the exhibit marked “B1A1” was found to be one packet containing not less than 0.02 grams of crystalline substance which was analysed and found to contain methamphetamine.

> 20.    Investigations revealed that the exhibit marked B1A1 belonged to the accused and was meant for his own consumption.

> 21.    Methamphetamine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA. The accused is not authorized to possess methamphetamine under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. He has thus committed an offence under section 8(a) of the MDA.

> 22.    Further, before the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 17 June 2015, in Subordinate Military Court, vide GCM/173/2015-2, convicted for an offence of possession of a controlled drug under section 8(a) of the MDA and sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment has not been set aside to date. The accused is thus now liable for enhanced punishment under section 33(1) of the MDA.

> **FACTS RELATING TO DAC-908711**

> 23.    On 6 March 2019, the accused provided two bottles of his urine samples which were sealed “CENTRAL NARCOTICS BUREAU” and marked “C-SA-19-00222-1 CHEE WEI JIE IN THE STATE COURTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE 5 JOSEPH SXXX” and “C-SA-19-00222-2 CHEE WEI JIE JOSEPH SXXX” in his presence. The said urine samples were sent to the HSA for analysis on the same day.

> 24.    On 13 March 2019 and 12 March 2019, the HSA issued two certificates under section 16 of the MDA bearing Lab. Nos: AT-1933-02008-001-03 and AT-1933-02008-002-03 respectively.

> 25.    Zhang HuiFen Hannah, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-19-00222-1 CHEE WEI JIE JOSEPH SXXX” issued the Certificate bearing the Lab No: AT-1933- 02008-001-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

> 26.    Chang Hian Twan, an analyst with the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA, having conduct of the analysis in relation to the urine sample marked as “C-SA-19-00222-2 CHEE WEI JIE JOSEPH SXXX” issued the Certificate bearing the Lab No: AT-1933-02008- 002-03, stating that on analysis, the said urine sample was found to contain methamphetamine.

> 27.    Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

> 28.    Investigations revealed that the accused had consumed “Ice” (street name for methamphetamine) alone at home prior to his arrest. The accused consumed “Ice” by pouring it into a glass pipe and using a lighter to burn the bottom of the pipe. The accused then used a straw attached to the pipe to smoke the fumes produced.

> 29.    The accused is not authorized to consume methamphetamine under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder. He has thus committed an offence under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA.

> 30.    And further, before the commission of the said offence, the accused was on 28 October 2013 in Subordinate Court 23, vide DAC 39338/2013, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, methamphetamine, under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and sentence to 12 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date, and was on 17 June 2015 in the Subordinate Military Court, vide GCM0173/2015, convicted of an offence for consumption of a specified drug, to wit, methamphetamine, under section 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment, which conviction and punishment have not been set aside to date. Accordingly, the accused is now liable to be punished under section 33A(1) of the MDA.

> **FACTS RELATING TO DAC-911620**

> 31.    The victim is Eugene Tan Jian Cai, a 29-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was the Leasing Manager of A.C. Leasing Pte Ltd located at 237 Alexandra Road #02-01 The Alexcier, Singapore.

> 32.    Investigations revealed that on 13 July 2018, at about 7.00 pm, the accused proceeded to A.C. Leasing Pte Ltd and made a request to Eugene Tan to rent a car. The accused showed Eugene Tan an NRIC and driving licence bearing the name “Tan Koon Ming” to represent and deceive Eugene Tan that he was the said person instead of who he really is, so as to dishonestly induce Eugene Tan to deliver a BMW 525i bearing registration number SJK8716P to him, which Eugene Tan would not have done if he were not so deceived.

> 33.    On 23 August 2018, the accused was arrested by the Police. Amongst other things, an NRIC and driver’s licence bearing the name “Tan Koon Ming” was found in the accused’s possession.

> 34.    By virtue of the foregoing, the accused has committed an offence under section 419 of the PC.

13     It was evident that the two main areas of dispute between the parties – as highlighted in grey in the table above - was the appropriate sentence for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of a weapon likely to cause death (_ie_, the section 326 PC offence) and whether the eventual global sentence accorded with the totality principle.

14     The reasons for my decision are set out below.

## Decision for the offences where the sentences were agreed or not substantially contested by the parties

### Antecedents

15     The accused had a number of related antecedents. The antecedents set out in **Annex 2** were read in court and admitted by the accused.

16     Given the parties’ submissions that there were only two primary areas of dispute, my decision focused on the appropriate sentence for the section 326 PC offence and the aggregate sentence in view of the totality principle. For completeness however, I set out below my brief reasons for the sentences imposed for the other offences which were either agreed or not substantially contested by the parties.

### Driving without due care and attention (DAC-906140)

17     The prosecution submitted for a fine of $1,000 whereas the defence submitted for a fine of $800. The accused failed to control his motorcar, which resulted in a collision onto a centre divider on 10 January 2019.

18     I agreed with the prosecution that a fine of $1,000 was warranted in this case. While no injuries were sustained, the accident could have potentially caused more serious damage or injuries given that the car had hit a road divider, mounted the kerb and overturned.[^3]

### Driving without valid licence (DAC-906141)

19     The prosecution submitted that a custodial sentence of one week’s imprisonment should be imposed for this offence for driving without a licence on 10 January 2019. While the defence’s initial position in its written submissions was for a fine of $600,[^4] the defence subsequently submitted during the hearing on 16 December 2021 that the short custodial sentence sought by prosecution was within the “usual range” considering that this was not the accused’s first traffic offence.[^5] In this regard, the accused was previously convicted and fined in 2013 for failing to comply with conditions of his provisional licence and for taking a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent.

20     I agreed with the parties that a short custodial sentence was warranted and imposed an imprisonment term of one week. A factor which I gave weight to in imposing a custodial sentence was the fact that the accused had fled the scene and abandoned the vehicle upon causing the accident on 10 January 2019.[^6]

### Driving without insurance coverage (DAC-906142)

21     The prosecution submitted for a fine of $1,000 whereas the defence submitted for a fine of $800. Insurance coverage is particularly crucial when an accident has caused injuries and/or damage to property. In this case, the accident resulted in a collision to the road’s centre divider and the overturning of the accused’s motorcar. In the circumstances, I was of the view that a high fine of $1,000 was justified.

22     As there were no special reasons not to impose a DQ Order, the accused was disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for period of 12 months - with the date of disqualification commencing from the date of _conviction ie_, 28 October 2021, as mandated under section 3(3) of the MVA.

### Failure to stop after accident (DAC-906143)

23     I agreed with both parties that a fine of $800 was warranted. In addition, I imposed a DQ Order of 12 months from the date of sentence _ie_, 16 December 2021. While the prosecution sought a DQ Order of 12 months that commenced from the date of _release_ from imprisonment,[^7] I declined to make such an order as I was of the view that this would be overly harsh given the length of the imprisonment term imposed in the present case. While the court has the discretion under section 42(1) of the RTA to order that a disqualification period start running from the date of release, I was mindful that the accompanying penalty imposed for this _specific_ offence was a fine and not a custodial sentence.[^8]

24     I imposed a fine of $800 and DQ Order of 12 months from the date of sentence.

### Failure to report for a urine test (DAC-908686)

25     Under regulation 15(3)(f) of the MDR, the accused was required to present himself at the Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters every Monday and Friday for each month for urine tests during the period of compulsory supervision imposed under the said regulations. The accused failed to present himself for the urine test on 4 March 2019 as he knew that he would test positive for the consumption of controlled drugs.

26     Both parties agreed that a six months’ imprisonment term should be imposed for this offence. Notably, there were several TIC Charges (refer to **Annex 1**) where the accused had similarly failed to report for scheduled urine tests. The accused did not report for the urine tests since October 2018 as he was consuming methamphetamine and knew that his urine would test positive for controlled drugs.[^9] An imprisonment term of six months was justified in the circumstances.

### Unauthorised possession of methamphetamine (DAC-908710)

27     On 5 March 2019 at about 10.26 pm, the accused was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau and found to be in possession of not less than 0.02 grams of methamphetamine.

28     It was not in dispute that the accused was liable for punishment under section 33(1) of the MDA. Both parties agreed that an uplift of an additional six months from the minimum mandatory imprisonment term of two years was warranted on the facts of the case. Before the commission of this offence, the accused was convicted and sentenced by a subordinate military court to two years’ imprisonment for possession of a controlled drug under section 8(a) of the MDA.

29     An imprisonment term of two years and six months was justified in the circumstances taking into account the accused’s past conviction and the similar TIC Charges on the unauthorised possession of drugs (refer to **Annex 1**).

### Unauthorised consumption of methamphetamine (DAC-908711)

30     The accused admitted to consuming methamphetamine on 5 March 2019. Before the commission of this offence, the accused was convicted and sentenced by a subordinate military court on two previous occasions on 28 October 2013 and 17 June 2015 for, similarly, the unauthorised consumption of methamphetamine. On the two previous occasions, he was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and three years’ imprisonment respectively.

31     It was not in dispute that the accused was liable for punishment for repeat consumption of specified drugs under section 33A(1) of the MDA. I agreed with both parties that the minimum mandatory sentence was appropriate in this case and imposed an imprisonment term of five years and three strokes of the cane.

### Cheating by personation (DAC-911620)

32     On 13 July 2018, the accused used an identification card and driving licence bearing the name “Tan Koon Ming” to represent and deceive one Eugene Tan into believing that the accused was the said Tan Koon Ming. As a result, Eugene Tan was induced to rent a motorcar to the accused. For the offence of cheating by personation under section 419 of the PC, both parties agreed that a two months’ imprisonment term was appropriate.

33     I agreed that the custodial threshold had been crossed in this case. The accused knowingly used an identification card and driving licence that was not his to rent a motorcar which was a potentially dangerous object. Notably, this was not a one-off incident – the accused faced three other TIC Charges (refer to **Annex 1**) where he had similarly used the identification card and/or driving licence bearing the name of “Tan Koon Ming” to cheat by personation.

34     I imposed an imprisonment term of two months.

### Driving in excess of speed limit (DAC-917845)

35     On 10 November 2018 at about 1.12 am, the accused drove his motorcar at a speed of 174 km/h in excess of the speed limit of 90 km/h along the Central Expressway. The usual penalty for driving more than 71 km/h above the speed limit is the maximum (or near-maximum) fine of $1,000; and an accompanying DQ Order of six to 12 months. The accused in this case exceeded the speed limit by 84 km/h.

36     Both the prosecution and defence submitted that a fine of $800 was appropriate. The parties did not seek a DQ Order. While a $800 fine is on the slightly low end, this was not inadequate given that the accused was driving late at night. The risk of harm was lower than compared to speeding during peak hours and/or on roads with high traffic and pedestrian volume. A DQ Order of at least six months would have been appropriate in view of the excessive speed but as no submissions were made on this point, I did not impose such an order. This did not, in any event, make a difference given the DQ Orders imposed for the offences committed in DAC-906142 and DAC-906143.

37     I move on to address the two primary areas of dispute between the parties: (i) the appropriate sentence for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of a weapon likely to cause death (_ie_, the section 326 PC offence); and (ii) whether the aggregate sentence accorded with the totality principle.

## Decision for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of a weapon likely to cause death (DAC-929093)

### The parties’ position

38     The prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence in this case was four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

39     The defence’s initial position in the accused’s written mitigation plea was that an appropriate sentence in this case was two years’ and four months’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.[^10] However, at the sentencing hearing on 16 December 2021, the defence submitted a re-calibrated position of three years’ imprisonment.[^11] The defence maintained that four strokes of the cane was appropriate in this case.

40     I will address the substantive arguments raised by parties in the section below.

### Reasons for decision

41     Both the prosecution and defence agreed that the three-step sentencing framework set out in _Ng Soon Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 3 SLR 1097</span> (“**_Ng Soon Kim_**”) in respect of a section 324 PC offence could be applied in this case by taking reference to causing grievous hurt instead of hurt _simplicitor_. Therefore, the sentencing framework for a section 326 PC offence was as follows.

> (a)     Under the first step, the court determines the notional starting sentence had the offence been one of voluntarily causing grievous hurt (_ie_, under section 325 of the PC).

> (b)     Under the second step, the court adds an uplift to the starting sentence derived from the first step, to take into account for the egregiousness of the dangerous weapon or means used to inflict the hurt.

> (c)     Under the third step, the court calibrates the final sentence according to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

42     I agreed with parties that the sentencing framework in _Ng Soon Kim_ could be transposed to the section 326 PC context. This transposed framework was applied in _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Syafiq bin Mohamed Abbas_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 114</span> at \[30\] (“**_Muhammad Syafiq_**”) and _Public Prosecutor v Alvin Ngor Xuan Hong_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 87</span> (“**_Alvin Ngor_**”). I similarly applied this framework for the present case.

#### Step 1: The notional starting sentence

43     For the first step, the prosecution submitted that the notional starting sentence for the present case was at least three years’ and six months’ imprisonment. The defence initially submitted that the notional starting sentence for the present case was 15 months,[^12] but during oral submissions, re-calibrated its notional starting sentence to two and a half years.[^13]

44     The Court of Appeal in _Public Prosecutor v BDB_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 1 SLR 127</span> (“**_BDB_**”) held that the factor that would guide the court’s determination of the indicative starting point for sentence should be the seriousness of the hurt caused to the victim: _BDB_ at \[56\].

45     At the outset, I should state that I disagreed with the defence’s original position that the notional starting point was 15 months’ imprisonment. For the reasons set out below, I also found the defence’s revised notional starting point of two and a half years’ imprisonment to be inadequate.

46     In my view, the defence’s reliance on _Alvin Ngor_ provided limited assistance to the analysis. In that case, the court held that the appropriate sentencing range for the injuries sustained by the victim was between nine to 12 months’ imprisonment: _Alvin Ngor_ at \[27\]. To elaborate, the accused in _Alvin Ngor_ had used a wrench and knuckle duster to hit the victim’s head and face. The victim sustained traumatic dental injuries involving the dislocation of his tooth, laceration on his lower lip and dento-alveolar fracture. The victim required root canal treatment and was given 14 days’ of medical leave. It was immediately apparent that the location _and_ nature of the injuries sustained by the victim in _Alvin Ngor_ were completely different from the present case. It was therefore difficult to draw any sensible parallels between the two cases for the purposes of sentence.

47     Instead, I found the prosecution’s reliance on _Muhammad Syafiq_ and _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Faizal bin Mohamed Salleh_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGDC 115</span> (“**_Muhammad Faiza_****l**”) more relevant to the present case.[^14] I elaborate below.

48     The indicative starting point of three years’ and six months’ imprisonment was applied in _Muhammad Syafiq_. In that case, the accused was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the victim by using a weapon of offence likely to cause death by stabbing and slashing the victim in the chest region with a multi-purpose knife. The victim underwent exploration of the left chest wall stab wound and evacuation of the chest wall haematoma, with toilet and suture of the left chest wound. A five-centimetre laceration of the external intercostal muscle was observed, with a large chest wall haematoma, but the laceration did not enter the internal intercostal muscle. The haematoma was evacuated from the chest wall manually and haemostasis was established. The wound was then cleaned and closed with sutures. After the operation, the victim was given two days of hospitalisation leave and 15 days of medical leave thereafter: _Muhammad Syafiq_ at \[8\] to \[10\]. The victim also sustained undisplaced fractures of the left sixth to eight ribs.

49     In applying the notional starting point of three years’ and six months’ imprisonment, the court in _Muhammad Syafiq_ found at \[35\] that the injuries enumerated in _BDB_ were of somewhat comparable severity to that in _Muhammad Syafiq_, given that the victim in the latter case sustained undisplaced fractures of the left sixth to eighth ribs. While the victim in _Muhammad Syafiq_ did not suffer as many fractures as the victim in _BDB_, the court held that this was counterbalanced by the fact that the victim also suffered a stab wound to the chest: _Muhammad Syafiq_ at \[35\].

50     While I agreed with the prosecution that _Muhammad Syafiq_ was relevant in determining the notional sentencing point for the present case, I was of the view that a calibration downwards to three years’ imprisonment was warranted given that the victim in the present case sustained one serious injury _ie_, stab wound to the abdomen and small bowel but did not sustain any rib fractures.

51     Having said that, I should add that the penetrating injury to the Victim’s abdomen and small bowel in the present case was of some severity based on the objective evidence. Specifically, it was noted in the medical report by Singapore General Hospital dated 6 December 2018 that:

> (a)     the Victim sustained a penetrating injury into his abdomen, with his abdominal content eviscerating through the wound;

> (b)     the Victim had to undergo exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection and haemostasis of the rectus haematoma; and

> (c)     the Victim sustained penetrating injuries to his small bowel and a segment of this was removed.

52     It was clear from the medical report that the injury was of some severity given that the penetration of the _parang_ knife had caused the Victim’s abdominal content to _eviscerate_ through the wound. This required surgical intervention thereafter and led to a segment of the Victim’s small bowel being removed. The Victim was also given a slightly lengthier medical/hospitalisation leave period (_ie_, 27 days) than the victim in _Muhammad Syafiq_ (_ie_, 17 days). The length of the hospitalisation leave was a relevant factor in ascertaining the seriousness of the hurt caused to a victim as it represented a medical professional’s opinion as to the length of time required for the treatment of the injuries and for the victim to resume his daily activities: _Tang Ling Lee v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 813</span> at \[26\].

53     Further, I was of the view that the notional starting point of three years’ imprisonment was appropriate when compared to _Muhammad Faizal_ where the accused was also charged with a section 326 PC offence. In that case, the accused had used a knife to stab the victim multiple times to the right side of the victim’s body. The victim sustained several lacerations and cuts to her body. Notably, she sustained a lateral chest wound (three centimetres by two centimetres and two centimetres deep) and two wounds to the right axillary: _Muhammad Faizal_ at \[27\]. The victim was given 27 days of hospitalisation leave and commenced work seven days thereafter. The court in that case found the notional sentencing point to be four years’ imprisonment: _Muhammad Faizal_ at \[52\].

54     As an aside, I note that the decision in _Muhammad Faizal_ pre-dated the decision in _Ng Soon Kim_ by a few months and that the court in _Muhammad Faizal_ did not have the benefit of considering the specific three-step sentencing framework laid out in _Ng Soon Kim_. Nevertheless, I found _Muhammad Faizal_ to be instructive. I should add that the High Court had dismissed the appeal in _Muhammad Faizal_ on 25 September 2019.

55     In _Muhammad Faizal_, the District Court applied a two-stage process in its analysis on sentence – first, by ascertaining the notional starting sentence based on the seriousness of the injury (_ie_, mirroring the first step of the _Ng Soon Kim_ sentencing framework) and second, adjusting the culpability of the accused based on the aggravating and mitigating factors. The court had considered the “use of the weapon” – in that case a knife – as part of the second stage: _Muhammad Faizal_ at \[54\] and \[55\]. It was therefore evident that the second _and_ third steps of the sentencing framework in _Ng Soon Kim_ were considered as part of the second stage of analysis in _Muhammad Faizal_. In the circumstances, while the court in _Muhammad Faizal_ did not technically apply the three-step framework in _Ng Soon Kim_, I found the notional sentencing point of four years’ imprisonment as instructive for the purposes of the present case.

56     It should be highlighted that _Muhammad Faizal_ and the present case involved victims sustaining stab wound(s) to the body. In my view, the present case warranted a significant _downward_ calibration of the notional sentence of four years’ imprisonment imposed in _Muhammad Faizal_ to three years’ imprisonment given that only one stab wound was inflicted on the Victim. That said, it must be stressed that while the number of wounds is a relevant factor, the analysis of the seriousness of the hurt caused cannot be based on a pure arithmetic calculation - a solitary stab at a vulnerable area of the body may have more dire consequences than multiple stabs made at less vulnerable areas of the body. In the prosecution’s words “\[i\]n the wrong area, a single stab can \[be\] fatal”[^15].

57     Ultimately, the court must assess the seriousness of injury based on the objective evidence. While the Victim in the present case sustained only one stab wound, it was apparent from the medical report that this injury was of some severity. As highlighted in \[51\] above, the Victim had sustained a _penetrating injury_ into his abdomen, with his _abdominal content eviscerating through the wound_. The injury required surgical intervention and _removal of a segment of the Victim’s bowel_. While the Victim in the present case only sustained one stab wound, he was given a similar number of days of hospitalisation leave as the victim in _Muhammad Faizal_.

58     In my judgment, taking the above factors into account, the indicative starting point ought to be in the region of three years’ imprisonment.

#### Step 2: Uplift to account for the egregiousness of the dangerous weapon

59     The weapon in question was a _parang_ knife consisting of a blade of about 34 centimetres long and handle of about 14 centimetres long.

60     Both the prosecution and defence agreed that an appropriate uplift was six months’ imprisonment in view of the nature of the weapon. A similar uplift for the use of a multi-purpose knife was also applied in _Muhammad Syafiq._ I note however that the court in _Muhammad Syafiq_ opined at \[43\] that “an uplift of six months seemed rather low, when juxtaposed against the inherently dangerous nature of a knife”.

61     As in the case of _Muhammad Syafiq_, in the absence of full submissions and given the agreement of parties on this point, I did not pursue it and applied an uplift of six months’ imprisonment under the second step.

#### Step 3: Calibrating for aggravating and mitigating factors

62     I found the following to be relevant aggravating factors.

> (a)     The accused had an antecedent for voluntarily causing hurt in 2013.

> (b)     The accused faced a TIC Charge for possession of two additional _parang_ knives.

> (c)     On the day before the stabbing on 19 August 2018, the accused had confronted the Victim at the door of the Unit and placed the pointed edge of a _parang_ knife on the left of the victim’s neck. This was the subject of a TIC Charge.

63     In mitigation, the defence submitted that the accused was suddenly awakened by the loud noises caused by the Victim. According to the accused, he became agitated as there was an incident a few months earlier where his friends had made a lot of noise which annoyed his neighbour and the police was called and his friends were subsequently arrested over other matters.[^16] In a fit of anger, the accused took the _parang_ knife to confront the Victim.[^17] Even if I were to accept the defence’s account, I would not attribute any weight to this insofar as this was being relied on to reduce the culpability of the accused. The accused’s act of stabbing the Victim in the abdomen and small bowel with a 34 centimetre-long _parang_ knife was quite simply, a grossly disproportionate and egregious response.

64     I agreed with the prosecution that the aggravating factors in \[62\] above would ordinarily have warranted a further uplift to the sentence. However, this uplift was offset by the mitigating effect of the accused’s guilty plea and co-operation with the authorities.

65     The total imprisonment term imposed for this offence was therefore maintained at three years’ and six months’ imprisonment.

66     For completeness, I should highlight that I compared the eventual sentence for this offence with two cases that were brought to the attention of the court by the prosecution _ie_, _Public Prosecutor v Jayselan s/o N Chandrasegar_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 321</span> (“**_Jayselan_**”) and _Public Prosecutor v Wong Guoliang_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 184</span> (“**_Wong Guoliang_**”).

> (a)     In _Jayselan_, the accused was charged with a section 326 offence for using a knife of about ten centimetres in length to stab the victim twice on her abdomen and slashing her on her back. The victim sustained, _inter alia_, stab wounds in her left hypochondrium and left iliac fossa, each approximately two to three centimetres. The medical evidence indicated that the small bowel perforations arising from the stabbing required surgery to resect the affected small bowel. For this offence, the District Court imposed a sentence of four years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The appeal was dismissed by the High Court on 1 April 2019.

> (b)     In _Wong Guoliang_, the accused was charged with a section 326 offence for using a _parang_ knife of about 35 centimetres in length to slash the victim’s left abdomen area. This caused the victim’s intestines to spill out of the wound. The accused also slashed the victim on his arm, cheek, upper back and right forehead area. The victim sustained, _inter alia_, a penetrating abdominal wound injury at the left paramedian region measuring five centimetres in length, with small bowel and colon injuries. Approximately 20 centimetres of the proximal jejunum and two centimetres of the transverse colon were unsalvageable and resected followed by bowel anastomosis. For this offence, the District Court imposed a sentence of five years’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane. The appeal to the High Court was withdrawn.

67     The two cases above pre-dated _Ng Soon Kim_ and therefore did not apply the three-stage sentencing framework. However, given the nature and location of the injuries sustained by the victims in _Jayselan_ and _Wong Guoliang_, these cases, at the very least provided an approximate indication of where the appropriate sentence should lie in the present case. In this regard, I agreed with the defence (and prosecution) that the injury sustained by the Victim in the present case was less severe and less extensive than the victims in _Jayselan_ and _Wong Guoliang_. A lower sentence – and when compared to _Wong Guoliang_, a _significantly_ lower sentence – of three years’ and six months’ imprisonment was therefore justified on the present facts.

### Summary of Decision

68     The prosecution submitted that six strokes of the cane was warranted for the offence whereas the defence submitted that four strokes of the cane sufficed.

69     In _BDB_ at \[76\], the Court of Appeal stated that “\[i\]n cases prosecuted under \[section 325\] of the Penal Code, our courts have invariably imposed, in addition to imprisonment sentences, caning of _at least_ six strokes where the offender in question is not exempted from caning under the CPC” \[emphasis in original\].

70     There were no exceptional circumstances in this case that warranted a deviation from the usual range of six to 12 strokes of the caning where non-fatal serious injury is caused. I therefore imposed a sentence of six strokes of the cane.

71     For the reasons above, I imposed a sentence of three years’ and six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane for the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by using a dangerous weapon likely to cause death.

## The Aggregate Sentence

72     I move on to the second and final area of dispute between the parties _ie_, the aggregate sentence and whether it accorded with the totality principle.

73     To recapitulate, the individual sentences and eventual aggregate sentence imposed by the court were as follows.

74     As the accused was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences, the court was bound to order the sentences for a least two of these offences to run consecutively.

75     I ordered the three imprisonment sentences highlighted in grey above to run consecutively.

> (a)     The consecutive running of these three sentences was entirely proper, given that they pertained to infringements of distinct legally protected interests: _Public Prosecutor v Raveen Balakrishnan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 799</span> (“**_Raveen Balakrisnan_**”) at \[41\] to \[46\] and \[48\].

> (b)     Further, the offences of consumption of methamphetamine and voluntary causing grievous hurt by use of a weapon likely to cause death were the most serious charges that the accused faced. While I was mindful that there was no presumption or rule that the two most severe sentences should ordinarily be selected to run consecutively: _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“**_Mohamed Shouffee_**”) at \[25\] - given their gravity, I was of the view that both these charges had to play an operative role in the aggregate sentence. In addition, I found it appropriate to run the sentence for the accused’s failure to report for a urine test consecutively to give accord to the accused’s persistence in failing to do so: refer to \[26\] above.

76     Conceptually, the consecutive running of the three sentences described in \[75(b)\] was in itself uncontroversial – this was in fact the position of both parties, although the prosecution also submitted that an _additional_ fourth sentence of two months’ imprisonment in DAC-911620 should run consecutively with the three sentences.

77     What was in dispute was the practical effect _ie_, the total length of the imprisonment term when the individual sentences were added up and whether it accorded with the totality principle.

78     In the defence’s address on sentence, [^18] the accused submitted that the accused’s offences were not so heinous and neither was the accused’s behaviour so egregious as to warrant a term of nine years’ and eight months’ imprisonment sought by the prosecution. The defence submitted that this was not in keeping with the accused’s records and prospects.

79     As I imposed an imprisonment term shorter than what the prosecution sought for in DAC-929093 and declined to run the imprisonment term for the sentence in DAC-911620 consecutively, the eventual aggregate sentence imposed by this court was eight years’ and twelve months. This was shorter than the aggregate imprisonment term sought by the prosecution by eight months.

80     I was of the view that this aggregate sentence accorded with the totality principle. The principle has two limbs. The first limb examines whether the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences committed. The second limb considers whether the effect of the sentence on the offender is crushing and not in keeping with the offender’s past record and his future prospects: _Mohamed Shouffee_ at \[54\] and \[57\].

81     I agreed with the prosecution that the aggregate sentence was not substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious individual offence committed, which is the section 326 PC offence in the present case.

82     A section 326 PC offence carries a maximum custodial term of 15 years. The midpoint of 15 years _ie_, seven and a half years may be taken as a proxy for the “normal level” of sentence imposed for section 326 PC offences: _Muhammad Syafiq_ at \[64\]. The court in _Muhammad Syafiq_ explained that if sentencing courts utilised the full spectrum of possible sentences (as they should), it was not unreasonable to postulate that the “normal level” of custodial terms imposed for an offence should not deviate far from the midpoint of the spectrum. The midpoint approach was also adopted by the High Court in _Ye Lin Myint v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 5 SLR 1005</span> (“**_Ye Lin Myint_**”) at \[94\] for a section 507 PC offence.

83     Reverting to the present case, the aggregate sentence was eight years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment. It cannot be said that this aggregate sentence was substantially above the seven and a year half years’ midpoint for a section 326 PC offence. In any event, while the midpoint was a useful proxy in applying the first limb of the totality principle, I was mindful that the more important inquiry was whether the global sentence was proportionate with the totality of the criminal behaviour: _Ye Lin Myint_ at \[94\].

84     As part of this inquiry, I reviewed the overall sentence to ensure that it was not crushing or not keeping with the offender’s past record and future prospects. Upon doing so, I was satisfied that the aggregate sentence was a fair one.

85     I agreed with the prosecution that the offences that the accused had committed and pleaded guilty to were numerous and offended many different legally protected interests and included serious offences. In addition, the accused had several antecedents for a variety of offences, which showed a persistence in criminal behaviour. Given the extensive criminality displayed by the accused, the aggregate sentence of eight years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment was proportionate.

86     In my view, it would not have been appropriate to adjust the aggregate sentence further downwards given that concurrent sentences had already been imposed in DAC-908710 (two years’ and six months’ imprisonment), DAC-911620 (two months’ imprisonment) and DAC-906141 (one week’s imprisonment). A further adjustment downwards of the eventual global sentence would not have properly reflected the accused’s overall criminality.

## Conclusion

87     For the reasons above, I sentenced the accused to an imprisonment term of eight years’ and 12 months’ imprisonment, nine strokes of the cane and a fine of $3,600 (in default ten days’ imprisonment). I imposed a DQ Order of 12 months to take effect from the date of conviction _ie_, 28 October 2021, and the other DQ Order of 12 months to take effect from the date of sentence _ie_, 16 December 2021.

88     Finally, it leaves me to thank the parties for their respective submissions and assistance to the court.
