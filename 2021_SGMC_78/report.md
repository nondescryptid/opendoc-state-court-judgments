3       At the conclusion of the trial, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had proven its case in respect of six out of the seven charges beyond a reasonable doubt. On 8 July 2021, I convicted the accused on six of the charges, namely MAC 906529-2019, MAC 906530-2019, MAC 906532-2019, MAC 906533- 2019, MAC 906534-2019 and MAC 906535-2019. As I was not satisfied that the amended third charge in MAC 906531-2019 had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, I ordered a discharge amounting to an acquittal in respect of the charge.

4       On 17 August 2021, after carefully considering the Prosecution’s address on sentence and the accused’s written plea in mitigation, I sentenced her as follows:

> (a)     MAC 906529 of 2019 – six months’ imprisonment;

> (b)     MAC 906530 of 2019 – two weeks’ imprisonment;

> (c)     MAC 906532-2019 – three months’ imprisonment;

> (d)     MAC 906533-2019 – two months’ imprisonment;

> (e)     MAC 906534-2019 – twelve months’ imprisonment;

> (f)     MAC 906535-2019 – four months’ imprisonment;

I ordered the sentences for the charges in MAC 906530-2019, MAC 906532-2019 and MAC 906534-2019 to run consecutively and the sentences for MAC 906529-2019 and MAC 906533-2019 to run concurrently. The total sentence is 15 months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 17 August 2021. I further ordered compensation of $2,500 in default eleven days' imprisonment to be paid to the victim.

5       The accused being dissatisfied with my decision has filed an appeal against her conviction, sentence and the order of compensation. She is currently on bail pending the hearing of her appeal. A stay of execution was granted for the sentence of imprisonment and the payment of the compensation award.

6       I now set out the grounds of my decision in full. 

###    Undisputed facts

7       The following facts are undisputed:

> (a)     The victim had worked as a foreign domestic employee for the accused from 29 September 2017 to 12 December 2017. She was employed on a two-year contract with a monthly salary of $600;

> (b)     When the victim worked for the accused, she was 19 years old and below the requisite minimum age of 23 years old for a foreign domestic employee. This was the first time the victim had worked in Singapore;

> (c)     The victim was to receive $30 each month for seven months initially as the balance of her monthly salary was to be used to pay the loan of $3,600 she owed to her agent. The victim did not have any days off days whilst working for the accused. Her mobile telephone was kept away from her as she was not allowed to have one. Her responsibilities included household chores and caring for the accused’s twin children who were then five years’ old;

> (d)     During the first week of her employment, the victim had sought to return home. She did not feel comfortable working for the accused as the victim found her to be a fierce woman. As her parents were unable to pay the compensation for the early termination of her employment, the victim decided to stay on;

> (e)     The accused was not satisfied with the victim’s work performance and her level of personal hygiene. She had conveyed her dissatisfaction to Ms Norhuda Binti Ahmad, the victim’s agent;

> (f)     The accused terminated the victim’s employment on 12 December 2017 without prior notice. The victim was left outside her employment agency by the accused’s husband without any explanation or her belongings.

> (g)     On 12 December 2017, a police report was lodged against the accused after the victim’s agent brought the victim to the Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre (“NPC**”**).

## The Prosecution's Case

8       It was the Prosecution's case that the accused had abused the victim, a domestic maid by voluntarily causing hurt and using criminal force on her. Apart from the physical assault, it was also the Prosecution’s position that the accused had committed criminal intimidation, insulted the victim’s modesty and had ill-treated the victim, a foreign domestic employee in contravention of the conditions of her work pass.

## The Defence's Case

9       The accused’s defence is one of a complete denial of the victim’s allegations.

## Issues to be determined

10     The issues to be determined were largely factual namely:

> (a)     whether the accused had insulted the victim’s modesty by making her shower in front of her in a room with open windows thereby intruding on her privacy;

> (b)     whether the accused had used criminal force on the victim by pulling the victim’s arm and pushing her into a shower otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation by the victim;

> (c)     whether the accused had used criminal force on the victim by pulling the victim’s shirt and causing one of the buttons to come loose and pulling at the victim’s bra and causing one of the hooks to come off otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation by the victim;

> (d)     whether the accused had ill-treated the victim, a foreign domestic employee by pouring powder onto her face and causing the powder to enter into her eyes causing her pain in contravention of her work pass conditions;

> (e)     whether the accused committed criminal intimidation by threatening the victim that her family in Lampung Indonesia would be harmed if the victim dared to do anything;

> (f)     whether the accused voluntarily caused hurt to the victim by pinching her breast, kicking her twice in the vagina area and closing the cupboard door on her forearm causing bodily pain and injury;

> (g)     whether the accused failed to grant the victim, a foreign domestic employee adequate rest daily during her period of employment between 29 September 2017 and 12 December 2017 in contravention of her work pass conditions.

## Assessment of the Evidence

11     The present case turns primarily on my determination of whether the victim’s account or the accused’s account of the events between 29 September 2017 to 12 December 2017 should be preferred. In my assessment of their credibility, I was guided by the case of _Farida Begam d/o Mohd Artham v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2001\] 3 SLR(R) 592</span> where the High Court has set out three key considerations in assessing a witness’s credibility namely:

> (a)     her demeanour;

> (b)     the internal consistency, or lack thereof, in the contents of her evidence; and

> (c)     the external consistency, or lack thereof, between the contents of her evidence and the extrinsic evidence _eg_ the evidence from other witnesses.

12     Where there is no other evidence is available, a complainant’s testimony can constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt when it is so unusually convincing as to overcome any doubts that might arise from the lack of corroboration (_AOF v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] 3 SLR 34</span> (“_AOF_”) at \[111\]). Where the complainant’s evidence is not unusually convincing, an accused’s conviction is unsafe unless there is some corroboration of the complainant’s story.

### General observations of the victim’s evidence

13     The victim was a young 19-year-old with lower secondary school education when she began working in Singapore for the first time. Prior to that she had worked as a domestic helper for various employers in Indonesia. I found the victim to be a timid, naïve and simple girl who had difficulty comprehending complex questions as she would often request for the questions to be repeated or simplified before she could respond. Although her account of the various incidents was generally consistent, there were also discrepancies in her testimony when compared against the other extrinsic evidence. During her testimony, I observed that the victim faced some difficulty comprehending the questions that were interpreted to her from English to Bahasa Indonesia by the initial Bahasa Indonesia interpreter. As I had concerns about the accuracy of the interpretation, I arranged for another Bahasa Indonesia interpreter to assist her in the subsequent court proceedings.

14     I will firstly deal with her direct evidence in respect of the various incidents chronologically as set out the seven charges.

### The victim’s evidence

#### First and Second Charges

15     The victim testified that the first incident of abuse occurred in the morning sometime in November 2017, slightly more than a month into her employment in the accused’s unit. According to her, the accused refused to believe that the victim had showered despite the victim telling her that she bathed every day in the morning. She further testified that the accused claimed that the victim was smelly. She also remarked that the victim’s towel smelled as well and threw it away. The accused then asked the victim to show her how she showered and dried herself without a towel. The victim gave evidence that when she retrieved a change of clothes, the accused then dragged the victim to the master bedroom toilet by pulling her by the arm and pushing her into the toilet. The accused then turned on the showerhead and sprayed water on the victim whilst she was still clothed. Thereafter, the accused placed shampoo on the victim’s head and instructed her to remove her wet clothing before turning on the rain shower in the toilet.

16     The victim testified that she removed her clothes as instructed and tried to rinse off the shampoo that the accused had applied on her head. She recalled that she was completely naked at this point when the accused’s husband suddenly entered the master bedroom. The victim explained that she was unsure whether the accused’s husband had seen her whilst she was naked in the shower as the entrance to the master bedroom was near the open toilet door. She therefore tried to cover her body. The accused noticed this and remarked to the victim that her husband “would not be interested”. The victim recalled that she was crying at the time but remained silent as she was afraid.

17     The victim testified that after she was done showering, she was asked by the accused to show how she would dry herself without a towel. The victim therefore attempted to dry herself using just her hands. She further testified that the accused then instructed the victim to change inside the master bedroom while the room windows were open and the accused seated on the bedroom mattress. The victim recalled seeing people outside the windows and was concerned that others would be able to see her. The victim testified that she had felt very humiliated during this incident as she felt that she had lost her value. I observed the victim had cried in Court as she recounted the incident. She further testified that she had not told anyone about the incident as she had felt ashamed. She gave evidence that she did not have her mobile phone as her agent had taken it away from her because she was not allowed to have one whilst working.

#### Third Charge

18     The victim testified that the next incident of abuse occurred a few weeks later, when the family went to Madam Kamariah’s (_ie_ the accused’s mother) house in the early morning. The victim recalled that the accused’s daughter had asked for food whilst her brother was still asleep. The victim asked Madam Kamariah for food and was given one packet of Maggi noodles that was intended to feed both the grandchildren. As she was hungry, after feeding half of the noodles to the accused’s daughter the victim ate the remaining portion that was intended for the accused’s son. According to her, this was witnessed by the accused’s father. When the accused’s son woke up and the victim asked Madam Kamariah for additional food, the latter then scolded her and instructed her to smack her mouth and to pull her ears whilst doing squat jumps.

19     The victim gave evidence that the accused found out about this incident when she returned to her mother’s house after work. She got angry with the victim and attempted to rip the victim’s blouse open by pulling apart the top of her shirt with two hands, causing the buttons to open. The accused then stuck her hand underneath the victim’s blouse and tried to remove her bra by pulling it. The victim testified that she had tried to stop the accused by pushing her hand away, hunching over and holding onto the front of her shirt. She recalled that the accused did not manage to pull her bra off her body but had torn her bra in the process. This said bra was eventually seized by the police (_Exhibit P39_) and two photographs _ie Exhibit P33_ and _Exhibit P34_ were also taken of it.

20     The victim testified that when this incident happened, the accused’s family members were home, although no one had intervened to stop the accused. Nevertheless, during her cross-examination, the victim also explained that she was unsure if the accused’s family members actually saw the incident, as she knew that they were present in the house and that the incident had occurred in an open area. According to her, she had been too focused on defending herself against the accused to notice whether the accused’s family had actually witnessed the incident.

#### 4th and 5th Charges

21     The victim testified that the next incident of abuse took place on the day that the accused’s family and the victim were preparing to go to Conrad Centennial Hotel for three days, for the accused’s bazaar event. According to her the incident happened in the early morning after the victim had showered and placed baby powder on her face. The accused commented that the victim looked ugly. She then instructed the victim to take her bottle of baby powder and bring it to the accused’s room. The accused then poured the baby powder all over the victim’s face until her eyes hurt. When the victim attempted to remove the powder from her face, the accused stopped her and threatened that if she removed the powder, her family would no longer be around when she returned home. The victim testified that she cried during the incident but had not said anything as she was afraid that something would happen to her family back home in Lampung. She further testified that she was afraid that the accused could make good on her threats as the accused had previously mentioned to her that her brother had married someone from Lampung.

22     The victim gave evidence that she and the accused’s family then left for the hotel. Upon their arrival at the hotel whilst in the car, the accused once again threatened to harm the victim’s family if the victim removed the powder from her face. She further gave evidence that this frightened the victim, who was too scared to remove the powder from her face. The victim testified that the stinging sensation to her eye lasted about an hour before it dissipated and after they had reached the hotel.

#### 6th Charge

23     The victim testified that during the three days at the hotel, she assisted to care for the children whilst the accused worked the bazaar. She slept in the same room as the accused and her family while the accused’s parents-in-law slept in the adjoining bedroom. She further testified that she slept on the hotel room floor whilst the rest of the family shared the bed. As it was cold at night, and she did not have a blanket, the victim tried to use one of the hotel towels to keep herself warm but the accused disallowed her from doing so. She was not allowed to bring any of her belongings with her to the hotel and therefore had no change of clothes despite being allowed to bathe.

24     The accused and her family subsequently left the hotel on 11 December 2017. The victim testified that the family reached the accused’s unit at about 3:00pm, she was asked to unpack and prepare the accused’s items as the accused had to hurry out of the house again. The victim further testified that she was unable to carry out her tasks in time and the accused had been shouting at her to hurry. The victim gave evidence that subsequently whilst the victim was in the kitchen, the accused pulled and pushed her, causing the victim to nearly hit herself against the kitchen tap. The accused then instructed the victim to go to her room and scolded the victim, before pulling the victim out again to the dining room.

25     The victim further gave evidence that whilst in the dining room, the accused proceeded to rip open the victim’s T-shirt down the front, exposing the victim’s bra. The accused then pinched the victim on the right breast, over the victim’s bra and shirt. The victim testified that the accused’s husband was in the dining room area at the time, and she therefore tried to cover her body up. However, the accused retorted that the victim’s breasts were “small”, and that her husband “would not be interested”. The accused then remarked that the victim’s clothes, including her underwear were smelly as the victim did not change them during the hotel stay. The accused then proceeded to kick the victim twice at her vagina. The victim testified that the first kick was very light but the second kick was harder causing the victim to trip and fall. The victim also testified that she hit her right lower back upon falling and felt pain in her crotch area. She was crying at the time and when she managed to stand up, the accused continued to berate her and instructed her to change her clothes so that they could leave.

26     The victim gave evidence that she walked over to the children’s room cupboard, where her belongings were kept. However, when she was about to take her clothing out of the cupboard, the accused entered the room and banged repeatedly on the sliding cupboard door with two hands whilst telling the victim to hurry up. The accused then pushed the cupboard door on the victim’s arm, despite being aware that the victim was still retrieving her clothing. This caused the sliding door to hit the victim’s right lower forearm, just above her wrist, causing her pain. The victim further gave evidence that despite knowing that the victim hurt her arm, the accused did not provide the victim with any medication. The victim testified that she cried because of the accused’s assault and her eyes were therefore red. The accused then commented that she did not look good and called the victim to her room. The accused then applied foundation on the victim’s face before they left the house.

27     The victim testified that the next day, on 12 December 2017 the accused’s husband dropped the victim off alone at the entrance of the agency. She further testified that at that time, she did not know that she was being sent back and why she was being sent back to the agency. She also did not have any of her belongings with her.

#### 7th Charge

28     The victim testified that in the course of her employment with the accused, as part of her routine she would wake up between 5:00 to 6:00 am and would sleep at irregular hours depending on when the accused finished work. According to the victim, her responsibilities included household chores and caring for the accused’s twin children. This required her to go to the accused’s mother’s house almost every day to care for the children when the accused and her husband were working and to return to the accused’s unit only at night.

29     She further testified that the accused would only return her mother’s house at odd hours ranging between 11:00pm to 1:00am. Thereafter, once the family returned home, the victim would have to continue with her household chores before sleeping. This resulted in her sleeping at irregular times late at night. In addition, the victim also testified that although she initially slept on the children’s pull-out bed at the start of her employment, thereafter she was made to sleep on the carpet in the children’s bedroom floor. The accused then subsequently instructed the victim to sleep on the floor outside the common toilet, although the victim decided to sleep underneath the cupboard in the living room instead.

30     The victim gave evidence that she was not given any pillow and blanket, and that the batik cloth she initially used as a blanket had been thrown away by the accused who complained that it was smelly. The accused also threw the victim’s clothing and towel away, claiming that these too were smelly. She subsequently purchased a new set of clothing for the victim and deducted the cost from the victim’s salary. The victim further gave evidence that she did not receive any payment from the accused throughout the course of her employment.

31     I next considered the victim’s documentary evidence, namely the handwritten statement she provided to her agent on 12 December 2017 (Exhibit P37). In her handwritten statement, she had made the following allegations:

> (a)     She had initially slept on the bed but had subsequently slept on the carpet. She was then disallowed from sleeping on the carpet as it was expensive and she was pushed by her employer;

> (b)     When she was doing her work, she was told to do her work quickly although she was unable to complete her work in a short time. She was pulled and pushed towards the sink.

> (c)     Her clothes were torn apart in front of the accused’s husband. Her shirt was torn and her crotch was kicked until she fell in front of the closet.

> (d)     She wanted to take the clothes that had been torn by the accused. While she was taking her clothes from the closet which she had opened, although the accused could see it, she had closed the closet while the victim’s hands were still in the closet;

> (e)     The victim was told to take a shower naked. She stated the accused saw her showering but remained silent when her husband entered her room;

> (f)     Some of the victim’s clothes were thrown away and she wore only two ‘clothes’ and one pair of pants. The accused had bought new clothes but threw them away and the victim was told to wear the wet pair of pants that had just been washed;

> (g)     The victim slept without sleeping mats and without a pillow on the floor near the closet;

> (h)     The accused’s mother told her to wash her face but had poked her face. The accused’s two children often beat and bit her almost every day;

> (i)     The victim’s towel had been thrown away so she took a shower without using a towel. Her batik cloth was taken and thrown away so she slept without using anything _ie_ without pillows or sleeping mats;

> (j)     The victim’s breast was pinched by the accused.

> (k)     When the victim was working, she was pushed.

32     I next considered the police report the victim had filed at the Punggol NPC on 12 December 2017 (Exhibit P38). In her police report, she had made the following allegations:

> (a)     The victim started working for the accused since 29 September 2017. About two to three weeks after, the accused did not believe that the victim had showered even though she showered every day. She dragged the victim into her bathroom in the master bedroom and asked the victim to strip herself which she did. The accused did not even close the toilet door and stood there. Her husband just walked into the master bedroom, passed by the toilet, looked at the victim, saw her naked and left thereafter. The accused then used the water spray on her and sprayed her once. She then passed the water spray hose to her and asked the victim to shower. The accused did not give the victim a towel and asked the victim to wear her bra and panties inside the toilet. The victim had to walk out of the toilet in her bra and panties and was asked to change inside the master bedroom. The accused had thrown away her towel about less than a month since she started work and whenever the victim bathed, she did not have a towel;

> (b)     On 11 December 2017 in the afternoon, as the victim was doing household chores, the accused said that she was not doing her chores fast enough. She was angry and started to scold and scream at the victim. She grabbed the victim’s T-shirt twice and pulled the victim towards her twice. Thereafter the accused tore the victim’s T-shirt exposing her bra in front of the accused’s children and her husband. The victim tried to cover herself and the accused asked her to remove her hands. She then dragged the victim from the living room to the service yard washing area by her right arm using her right hand and pushed her with her left hand to the washing machine. She kept scolding the victim and asked her to go to the children’s room to collect clothes for the victim to wear. While they were in the children’s room, the employer slammed the cupboard door against her forearm. She then asked the victim to change in the living room. The accused’s husband was in the master bedroom at that point in time. After changing, the victim was standing when the accused used her right leg to kick the victim twice on her private part until she fell. The victim then cried. The accused asked the victim to stand up and said that her breasts were very small. The accused pinched her right breast once using her right hand;

> (c)     On most days, the victim sleeps at about 1:00 to 2:00am and she wakes up at 7:00am. At times, if the accused has a wedding décor event, she will sleep late at 4:00am to 5:00am as the accused asked the victim to accompany her. She was not given breakfast, for lunch she would eat whatever is cooked at home and for dinner she will follow the accused to the restaurant to eat. At the wedding décor events, she was asked to work by her employer by washing plates and putting on seat covers. She was not paid extra for this;

> (d)     During the second month when she worked, one of the twins (the boy) took her right hand and bit her forearm. Thereafter, when she was at the kitchen the accused asked one of the twins (the girl) to pull down her pants. She then wore them back on;

> (e)     Whenever the accused goes to her mother’s house, the victim was asked to sit at the garden of the landed house on a chair as she was not allowed to work. She was only given the balance of the children’s food. On the same day, the victim was supposed to go to a wedding event. While she still at the house, she had wanted to wash her face. The accused’s mother took the water spray hose, sprayed on her face and used the spray to hit her on the nose;

> (f)     In November 2019 at the accused’s mother’s house, the victim was asked to strip naked in front of her accused, her mother, her children and the accused’s husband. This was because the victim had asked the accused’s mother for more Maggi noodles as she had eaten the balance of the children’s meal and the children wanted more. The accused pulled the victim’s blouse and removed two of her buttons. The victim is afraid of the accused;

> (g)     On 12 December 2017 at 3:00 plus pm, the victim was sent back to the maid agency without packing her stuff. The accused threatened the victim not to tell anyone as she knows someone in Indonesia and will ask them to kill her family.

33     I then considered the available extrinsic evidence in support of the victim’s evidence.

### Prosecution’s Extrinsic Evidence

#### PW 6 – Norhuda Binti Ahmad

34     The victim’s agent, Ms Norhuda Binti Ahmad (“PW6”) testified that this was the victim’s first time working in Singapore. During the victim’s brief period of employment, she kept in contact with the accused via WhatsApp messages and telephone calls. PW6 also testified that the messages admitted in _Exhibit P45_ were not in order as she had simply highlighted, copied and pasted the messages out of WhatsApp and she no longer had her company mobile phone. She gave evidence that during some of her calls with the accused, she had also spoken with the victim on four occasions.

35     PW6 testified that about two weeks after the victim first began working for the accused, as part of her practice she had called the accused to check if the victim was okay. According to PW6, the accused commented that the victim was “okay but a little bit blur and slow”. She also testified that she spoke to the victim who informed her that she was okay and was adapting.

36     PW6 testified that in the first WhatsApp message from the accused, the latter had complained that the victim had not cleaned the house properly. PW6 called the accused who complained that the victim’s standard of work had declined and that the victim was smelly. PW6 further testified that she spoke to the victim and advised her to focus on her work. She also asked the victim about the allegations in relation to her body odour. The victim replied that she did shower although the accused continued to tell her that she smelled. She gave evidence that the victim informed PW6 that although she was initially allowed to sleep on the mattress, she was later made to sleep on the carpet. PW6 further gave evidence that she spoke to the accused about this and reminded her that the Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) regulations required that domestic workers be provided a mattress and pillow. The accused then replied that it was the victim who preferred sleeping on the carpet.

37     PW6 testified that the accused subsequently messaged PW6 to complain that the victim did not prepare breakfast or food for her husband and children. PW6 asked the accused if she wanted a change of maid. She further testified that the accused did not respond until sometime later where she said she did not wish to change her maid.

38     PW6 gave evidence of an occasion where the accused had asked PW6 to call her. It was the Prosecution’s case that based on the accused’s own account as well as her husband’s account, this call took place latest on 29 October 2017. PW6 testified that the accused complained that the victim had closed the toilet door when the children were in the toilet. PW6 then spoke to the victim, who admitted that she closed the toilet door on the children as they did not listen to her. According to PW6, she chided the victim who apologized.

39     PW6 further testified that later the same day, the accused called PW6 to tell her that the victim wanted to go home. The accused then said that if the victim wanted to go home, she would need to pay up her loan, and the accused therefore called the victim’s family about the victim’s loan. PW6 gave evidence that she told the accused that she was not supposed to contact the victim’s family directly. She then spoke to the victim over the phone, and the victim informed her that her family did not have the money to pay off the loan. She noticed that as the victim sounded sad, she asked her if she had anything to tell her. The victim then asked if she was allowed to assist the accused with her work such as arranging chairs. According to PW6, she told the victim that she was not supposed to do so. The victim also informed PW6 that she would sometimes return home late from these wedding assignments and did not have enough rest. PW6 then informed the accused that she was not allowed to ask the victim to assist her with her work.

40     PW6 gave evidence that apart from these messages and calls, she also received several pictures from the accused which accompanied her complaints that her house was messy and that the victim was sleeping. She further gave evidence that there was no further communication between her and the victim after the telephone call in relation to the victim’s loan. The next time she had messaged the accused was to ask if everything was okay and to speak to the victim. According to her, the accused told her the victim was busy and did not call her back. PW6 testified that the last time the accused contacted her was just before she sent the victim back to the agency.

41     PW6 gave evidence that on 12 December 2017, she was working in the agency office when the accused’s husband dropped the victim off without any of her belongings and without signing the authorization form. According to PW6, she noticed that the victim looked sombre and when asked if the accused had ever hit her, the victim turned silent and began crying. She further gave evidence that she told the victim not to be afraid and tried to coax the victim into telling her what happened. PW6 eventually managed to get the victim to provide her with some details of what had happened and instructed the victim to write the same on a note pad _ie_ Exhibit P37.

42     PW6 testified that after hearing the victim’s account of what had happened, and in line with MOM’s directions, she brought the victim to Punggol Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) to lodge a report. She also testified that she waited outside whilst the police officers interviewed the victim, and thereafter assisted the NPC officers to translate the report back to the victim in a mixture of Malay and Bahasa Indonesia. PW6 gave evidence that sometime after making the report, she received a call from the accused asking what had happened. She informed the accused that she had brought the victim to make a police report as there were allegations that the accused had abused her. The accused became angry upon hearing this and hung up on PW6.

#### PW 7 – Senior Staff Sergeant Jasintha d/o Sudhagar

43     Senior Staff Sergeant Jasintha d/o Sudhagar (“PW7”) testified that she had attended to the victim at Punggol NPC when she lodged the police report (Exhibit P38). PW7 spoke to PW6 first, before bringing the victim to a separate room to interview her. PW7 further testified that this was done to ensure that there was no risk that the victim was acting under the agent’s influence and because the victim was crying.

44     PW7 testified that she later ascertained that the victim had been crying as she was afraid. She further testified that the victim was “very, very quiet” and was “scared” as she was concerned that someone would harm her family in Indonesia if she made a report and therefore had to be assured that she was safe.

45     PW7 testified that the victim was noticeably scrawny unlike in her work permit picture. After interviewing the victim and conducting a visual check on her, she sought the assistance of PW6 to translate the victim’s account for the purposes of lodging the police report. She further testified that the police report was then typed out and lodged by Senior Staff Sergeant Hannah Adam (“PW8”).

#### PW4 – Former Investigating Officer Inspector Ong Chun Kiat

46     Inspector Ong Chun Kiat (“PW4”) testified that he was the initial investigating officer for the present case. After the police report was lodged, the victim’s matter was referred to him for further investigation. He further testified that after being briefed of the matter, he had arranged for the victim to be sent for a medical check-up and for photographs to be taken of her. PW4 gave evidence that he recalled that the victim appeared flustered and nervous when he spoke to her.

#### PW 2 – Dr Lai Yin Wen

47     Dr Lai Yin Wen (“PW2”) testified that he had examined the victim on 13 December 2017 at the Acute and Emergency Care Centre of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH). He confirmed that the victim gave a history of being assaulted by her employer three days prior and her employer’s child bit her one week prior. The victim claimed that her employer used the cupboard door to hit against her right forearm and kicked over her private part three days prior. She had complained of right forearm pain.

48     He further testified that her injuries were about two-thirds of her right forearm and there was a bite mark over the distal one-third of the right forearm. On examination, there was mild tenderness over the victim’s right lower back and a bite mark over the right mid forearm with tenderness and swelling. PW2 gave evidence that the bite mark, and the tenderness and swelling were two separate injuries, with the bite mark being an old scar.

49     PW2 testified that the victim was noted to have contusions at her groin during examination. According to him, although these were not visible injuries, he had arrived at these findings by carrying out palpations on the victim’s body to localize the areas of true tenderness. He further testified that the injuries found on the victim were generally consistent with the victim’s patient history. During his cross-examination, PW2 gave evidence that a urine test was conducted to determine whether there was any injury to the victim’s groin area. He further gave evidence that there was no blood in her urine sample and her urine was clear.

#### PW5 – Former Investigating Officer Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Or Jun Wen Sylvester

50     ASP Or Jun Wen Sylvester (“PW5”) testified that he had taken over the case from PW4 and had recorded statements from the accused, her husband and the victim. He further testified that on 15 December 2017, he together with two of his colleagues brought the victim back to the accused’s unit to retrieve her belongings and for scene photographs to be taken. He gave evidence that during the scene visit, the police retrieved the victim’s bra from the ground outside the unit, where the bamboo poles were hung. According to him the victim had identified it to be the one that the accused damaged when she had attempted to pull it off her.

#### PW9 - Investigating Officer Inspector Chia Wei Liang, Desmond

51     Inspector Chia Wei Liang, Desmond (“PW9”) testified that he had conducted follow-up investigations with MOM and to ascertain the distance between the accused’s unit and her mother’s house. PW9 further testified that based on his investigations with the MOM, foreign domestic workers are supposed to receive adequate and sufficient rest, which would generally mean eight hours of rest during the day. This was also accompanied by the requirement to provide appropriate accommodation for the worker, which included the provision of a mattress, blanket and pillow.

52     He gave evidence that MOM had confirmed that this information was communicated to all employers through the orientation programme and an online employer’s handbook, and that based on MOM’s records, the accused attended the said programme back in August 2009.

### General observations of the accused’s evidence

53     The accused’s defence is a complete denial of the victim’s allegations. At the material time, the accused was a busy events planner who worked throughout the week and had left the household chores entirely to the victim. It is apparent from the facts that there was a mismatch between the accused’s expectations of the victim and the victim’s actual abilities. The victim was often unable to complete her tasks as fast as the accused wanted her. This resulted in the victim being at the receiving end of her ire. According to the accused, she had kept the latter in her employment out of sympathy although it lasted for less than three months.

54     I observed that the accused is a person who is particular about cleanliness as she had returned her previous Indonesian domestic helper for this reason. She had attributed this to the fact that her children were born prematurely and as such a clean environment as well as hygienic food preparation was necessary. From the evidence before me, it was clear that the accused did not think that the victim bathed or showered properly as she found the victim and her belongings to be smelly.

55     Her dissatisfaction with the victim’s personal hygiene as well as her work performance is evident from her WhatsApp messages in Exhibit P45 and PW6’s testimony of the accused’s calls to her complaining about the victim. After the incident where the victim had locked the accused’s children in the bathroom, she would bring the victim and the children to her mother’s house whenever she was at work as the accused no longer trusted her. Although the victim only had to look after the children when she was at the accused’s mother’s house, she was expected to complete her household chores when they were back at the accused’s unit.

56     By her own admission, the accused brought the victim to her events on weekends (ostensibly to assist her) and they would only return home from her mother’s house after consolidating her client’s feedback on the event. This would have been contrary to the conditions of the victim’s work pass as the victim’s duties would be confined to the accused’s home or those related to the care of the children.

57     In terms of the victim’s well-being, I observed that although the accused testified that the victim was free to help herself with the food available in the house, the victim was expected to share food with the children whenever they ate out. In light of PW7’s objective testimony that the victim was noticeably scrawny unlike in her work permit picture, I found this to be consistent with the victim’s account that she was not given sufficient food in the course of her employment. This was inconsistent with the accused’s portrayal of herself as a benevolent employer who brought the victim to eat at restaurants and for an overseas trip to Kuala Lumpur.

58     I will next deal with the accused’s evidence in respect of the charges.

### The accused’s evidence

59     The accused testified that she got married on 18 April 2009 and has twins, a daughter and a son who were born on 25 November 2012. She has a private diploma in Business Administration. She started living at the said unit at 28 Flora Drive, Ferraria Park in 2017 and shifted out at the end of 2017. Her husband, Mr Muhammad Ridwan Bin Rashid (“**DW2**”) was working at the Angsana Home. At the material time, on weekdays her children attended pre-nursery classes at _Kidz Meadow_ from 12 noon to 3:00 or 4:00 pm and on weekends they had religious classes at _Andalus_ from 9:00 to 11:00am.

60     She also testified she was assisting her mother as an events planner. She organised weddings and participated in events at bazaars. She did not have fixed working hours and would leave as early as 7:00 to 8:00am on weekdays but during weekends she would leave as early as 5:00am. On weekends, the victim would follow her to her events and after the event, they would go to her mother’s house to consolidate the client’s feedback on the event. She would return home at 10:00 or 11:00 pm on most days.

61     She gave evidence that after she had given birth in 2012, she had an Indonesian domestic worker. In 2013 or 2014, she was returned to the agency due to issues with cleanliness. She further gave evidence that few months prior to employing the victim, she had a domestic helper from Myanmar. She returned her as they had difficulty in communication as they could not understand each other.

62     The accused testified that when the victim arrived at her home, she briefed her on her work, about her children being delivered prematurely, that they cannot be in a dirty environment and the way their milk and food should be prepared. The victim was told that she could help herself with the food that was available in the house. The victim was also informed that as the accused is a businesswoman, she was concerned about the way the victim does things and cleanliness as it would reflect on her business.

63     The accused also testified that prior to 28 October 2017, the victim would be at home with the children as she was comfortable with leaving them with the victim. The children would go to school from home and if they made plans to go out, her husband would fetch them from school and then they would meet. After the incident on 28 October 2017 when she found out that the victim had locked her children in the toilet, she would send her children and the victim to her mother’s house or bring the victim out with her. According to her, she informed PW6 of this incident the following day. PW6 told her to report the incident to the police but she did not do so as the victim had pleaded with her not to as she wanted to work. Out of sympathy she told the victim she would not report the incident but the victim was to promise not to do it again.

64     The accused gave evidence that the only problem she had with the victim was when the victim could not accept whenever the accused told her off for her wrongdoing. The victim would make faces and show her unhappiness at being told off. Whenever she was reprimanded, she would ask to be sent back to her village. Each time she did so, the accused would inform her that if she were to be sent back to her village, the accused would have to pay the agent. If she really wanted to be returned, she would have to sent back to her agency.

65     The accused further gave evidence the victim requested to call her father when she informed the accused that her father would be able to pay up the loan. This was the only occasion when the accused used her own mobile telephone to call the victim’s father. According to the accused she did not have the telephone numbers of the victim’s father or any of her family members. The accused testified that she was unable to recall the exact number of times she allowed the victim to talk to her agent but had allowed her to do so a few times without any interruptions using the accused’s mobile telephone.

66     In respect of the first charge and second charge, the accused denied the victim’s allegations regarding the incident. She also denied throwing away the victim’s towel but instead had bought one for her. As woman she would not do such a thing that would affect the victim’s dignity. She testified that as a wife she would not have allowed her husband to watch a naked woman. She also testified that she would not allow him to look at other women and even when they were outside, she would get angry if he were to do so. According to the accused as she had installed tinted film on her windows, it was not possible for people from outside to see the interior of her unit.

67     In respect of the third charge, the accused denied the victim’s evidence of the incident that occurred at her mother’s house. According to the accused, the victim had asked for permission to do chores at her mother’s house but she did not allow her to do so as she did not want the victim to complain about it one day. Furthermore, her mother had her own Indonesian domestic helper. The victim was only to take care of her children, give them their baths and their meals. She testified that the first time she saw the victim’s bra or a picture of it was in Court. According to her it was normal for a bra’s hook to be loose or for the front centre to be torn apart due to frequent usage and washing.

68     In respect of the fourth charge, the accused denied ill-treating the victim by pouring powder onto her face, causing the powder to enter her eyes and injuring her. According to the accused, she had checked into the hotel in the early hours of 8 December 2017 with her husband, her children, both her parents-in-law and the victim. Similarly, in respect of the fifth charge, the accused also denied threatening the victim that her parents would not be there when she returned to Lampung if she removed all the powder on her face. According to her, throughout the event she had lost her voice and she was unable to communicate. She resorted to communicating with her vendors using hand signs and signals and had checked into the hotel using this method.

69     In respect of the sixth charge, the accused testified that on 11 December 2017, they had checked out of the hotel after 4:00pm. The victim was sent home while the accused and her family had gone out to eat. She instructed the victim ‘to do whatever that was in the house’ and to clean the house as it had been four days since they were in the house. According to the accused, she did not enter the house. They returned home after 10:00pm as she had brought her staff to an appreciation dinner. She further denied the victim’s allegation of the incident at about 4:00pm in her house or having touched her at all.

70     In respect of the seventh charge, the accused denied that she had not given the victim adequate rest during her period of employment She denied depriving the victim of sleep as according to the accused, the victim had enough rest. If the victim slept late, she was allowed to wake up late. The victim was also allowed to sleep in the car or at the accused’s mother’s house.

71     The accused gave evidence that on 12 December 2017, she decided to send the victim back to the agency as she was tired of her. During the stay at the hotel, the children did not take care of the children well. She also stated that the victim always lies and was not forthcoming with her wrongdoing. According to the accused, the victim stole her ‘stuff and other things’. She felt that they were not made for each other and she made the decision to send her back so that she may get a new employer. She had also instructed her husband not to inform the victim that she was being sent back to the agency. She believed that the victim made these allegations as she was angry at being sent back to the agency.

### Defence’s extrinsic evidence

72     DW2 testified that he has been married to the accused for 10 years and 7 months. He is working as a part-time _Grab_ driver as well as a _Lalamove_ driver. At the material time, he worked as an operation executive at the Angsana home and was also a part-timer in his mother-in-law’s company. Prior to that he was a Staff Sergeant and was in the police force for 13 years.

73     He also testified that they had employed three domestic workers including the victim. They had one from Myanmar who was sent back due to a communication barrier and the second one was from Indonesia who had a hygiene problem. He also testified that the victim is a college student who wanted to be a babysitter. She agreed to become a domestic worker as she had wanted to get out of the training centre. According to DW2, the victim had never complained to him about anything and everything in relation to food and clothes was good. The victim had been provided with a mattress, a blanket and pillows.

74     When asked about the victim’s work performance, he gave evidence that the victim basically did her job but had made mistakes. The accused would nag at the victim but he had not seen her hit or physically touch the victim. According to DW2, once in a while the accused would shout at the victim and would nag at her because the victim did not do her work. DW2 testified that he did not have any personal problems with the victim. He gave evidence that the victim did not keep her clothes properly and would leave her old clothes underneath the sink. She did not fold her clothing or organise them in the space given to her in the children’s wardrobe.

75     DW2 denied seeing the accused making the victim shower naked and splashing water on her when he was in the room. He testified that the accused was a jealous person who would check his telephone. According to DW2 as he worked the 8:00pm to 8:00am shift at the Angsana Home, when he returned home most of the time the victim and his children would be sleeping or that the victim would be doing the household chores.

76     He denied witnessing the accused pulling the victim’s shirt and causing her buttons to come loose at his mother-in-law’s house. He also denied witnessing the accused pull the victim’s bra causing the bra hooks to come off. He testified that the victim did not raise any complains to him about the incident.

77     DW2 denied that the accused had ill-treated the victim by pouring powder onto her face on 8 December 2017. He testified that his parents would scold him if such an incident had happened as they were close to Indonesians. He also denied that the accused had threatened to harm the victim’s family in Lampung as none of them had details of who they were and where they were staying in Lampung. DW2 gave evidence that during their hotel stay, the victim had adequate clothing and it was not possible for her to have worn the same clothes throughout the stay.

78     In respect of the sixth charge, DW2 denied witnessing the accused pinching the victim’s breasts, kicking her in the vaginal area and closing the cupboard on her forearm causing the victim bodily injury. He did not think that the accused was capable of doing so as she had problems with her knees. If she sat down for too long, she would need DW2’s help to get up.

79     He gave evidence that on 11 December 2017, they had checked out of the hotel at around 5:30pm. He drove them home and dropped the victim off with their luggage. He had sent her to the door, gave her the house key and reminded the victim of the accused’s instructions to clean up the dirty laundry and to eat whatever that was in the cupboard. He would also bring back some food for her to eat while his family waited in the car.

80     They returned home after 10:00pm and closer to 11:00pm. He further gave evidence that he heard a commotion in the kitchen and the accused asking the victim why she had not cleaned their laundry after 4 to 5 hours in the house. The victim responded that she had cleaned the house. He testified that he saw that the victim had washed her own clothes as she had hung them. He then persuaded the accused to speak to the victim in the morning. DW2 also testified that they then decided to send the victim back to her agent. After that, they went to sleep. He gave evidence that he had not witnessed any of the allegations in the seven charges and believed that the victim had lodged the report due to the past nagging from the accused.

### Assessment of the victim’s evidence

#### Victim’s evidence was credible and internally consistent

81     In the present case, I found the victim to be a truthful witness who gave a credible and consistent account of the various incidents save for the incident in November 2017 at 32 Meragi Road _ie_ the amended third charge. Essentially, I found her testimony to be internally consistent with her written statement to PW6 and her police report that were given on 12 December 2017. This is despite the numerous difficulties the victim faced with interpretation and the attempts by the Defence to impeach her credit on the inconsistencies in her evidence. In my view, the inconsistencies in the victim’s evidence highlighted by the Defence were not material but instead I found her evidence to be clear, logical and convincing. On the facts of the present case, I found the victim to be coherent and consistent in the material aspects of her testimony.

#### Victim’s evidence was externally consistent

82     Her testimony was also externally consistent with the extrinsic evidence from the various Prosecution witnesses as set out at \[33\] to \[51\] above. Her account of the assault by the accused on 11 December 2017 was supported by the objective evidence of PW2 and the medical report which documented the injuries found on her.

83     I also found that PW6’s evidence also corroborated key aspects of the victim’s evidence. PW6 had corroborated the victim’s account of the victim’s sleeping arrangement and the fact that she did not receive sufficient rest. When PW6 spoke to the accused about the victim being made to sleep on the carpet, the accused had responded that it was the victim who preferred sleeping on the carpet. I agreed with the Prosecution, what was implicit in this response was in fact the victim was sleeping on the carpet instead of on the children’s mattress as alleged by the Defence.

84     Both PW6 and PW7 had testified how shaken the victim was during their interaction with the victim on 12 December 2017. This aspect was unchallenged by the Defence. PW6 gave evidence that the victim began crying upon being asked whether she had been assaulted by the accused. PW7 similarly noticed that the victim was crying during her interview and upon probing she discovered that the victim was afraid to make a police report as she was concerned that her family would be harmed if she did so. I agreed with the Prosecution that both PW6’s and PW7’s observations of the victim were consistent with the victim’s account that she had been repeatedly threatened by the accused and that she had remained silent about the abuse she suffered for fear of that harm would come upon her family otherwise.

85     In order to challenge the credibility of the victim’s testimony, the Defence had raised several assertions that the victim had numerous opportunities to seek help. I agreed with the Prosecution that based on the unchallenged evidence of PW6 and DW2, PW6 had last spoken to the victim on 29 October 2017 which predated all the November 2017 and December 2017 events in the amended first charge to the amended sixth charge.

86     PW6 had testified that the victim had raised matters in relation to her inadequate rest and poor sleeping arrangements during the opportunities she had to speak to the victim. She further gave evidence that there was no further communication between her and the victim after the telephone call in relation to the victim’s loan. It was unchallenged that the next time PW6 messaged the accused to ask if everything was okay and to speak to the victim, the accused told her the victim was busy and did not call her back. Based on the above and the fact that the victim did not have her mobile telephone when she was employed by the accused, I agreed with the Prosecution that the victim did not have any real opportunity to seek help at an earlier juncture.

87     I now turn to the third amended charge.

88     In respect of the amended third charge, the victim had given a graphic account of how the accused had pulled apart the top of her shirt with two hands causing the buttons to open and had stuck her hand underneath the victim’s blouse to remove her bra by pulling it. According to the victim, the accused did not manage to pull her bra off her body but had torn her bra in the process. Nevertheless, the particulars of the charge on the alleged pulling of her bra by the accused and causing one of the hooks to come off were not reflected in her handwritten statement and her police report. Such graphic details regarding the incident which occurred just one month prior to her handwritten statement and police report would have been fresher in her mind as compared to when she gave evidence in court.

89     Furthermore, upon examination of the physical exhibit, I was not convinced that the bra was in such a state due to the alleged accused’s actions of pulling and causing it to tear the bra. On the facts, I found her evidence in respect of the amended third charge internally inconsistent and uncorroborated by extrinsic or objective evidence I also did not find the victim’s evidence on this incident so unusually convincing as to overcome the doubts I had from the lack of corroboration.

90     Based on the above, I accepted the victim’s evidence in respect of six out of the seven charges. In my view, it was clear from the evidence that the victim had no apparent or plausible reason to frame the accused. The Defence has not provided any evidence of her motive to lie and give false evidence in court.

91     I now turn to the accused’s evidence.

### Assessment of the accused’s evidence

#### The accused was not a credible witness

92     Conversely, I did not the find the accused to be a credible witness. After a careful examination, I found her evidence to be inherently incredible and materially inconsistent. Although the accused had portrayed herself as a benevolent employer who provided her with necessities as required by MOM, brought the victim out for meals and outings and who gave her sufficient food and rest, this was internally inconsistent with her own testimony. As observed earlier, although the accused testified that the victim was free to help herself with the food available in the house, the victim was expected to share food with the children whenever they ate out or when the children were at their grandmother’s house.

93     At the material time, the accused was a busy events planner who did not have fixed working hours and would leave as early as 7:00 to 8:00am on weekdays. She left the household chores and the care of her children entirely to the victim. On weekends, she would leave as early as 5:00am and the victim would follow her to these events. After the event, they would go to her mother’s house to consolidate the client’s feedback on the event. Although according to the accused, she would return home at 10:00 or 11:00 pm on most days, I was of the view the later timings provided by the victim was more accurate. Although it was unchallenged that victim only had to take care of the children when she was at the accused’s mother’s house, she was expected to continue with her household chores before sleeping once she was back at the accused’s unit. This resulted in her sleeping at irregular times late at night.

94     It is clear from the facts that the victim was often unable to complete her tasks as fast as the accused wanted her. This resulted in the victim being at the receiving end of her ire. This was corroborated by DW2 who testified that the accused would shout at the victim albeit once in a while and would nag at her because the victim did not do her work.

#### The accused’s account was internally inconsistent

95     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had an obvious tendency to twist and embellish her evidence to suit her own ends. This is evident from the many allegations and claims she raised that were either not put to the relevant Prosecution witness or were inconsistent with her defence at trial. For instance, when asked about the victim’s allegation that she had been threatened by the accused prior to their hotel stay, for the first time she raised her claim that she had lost her voice throughout the event and could not have possibly threatened her. She resorted to communicating with her vendors using hand signs and signals and had checked into the hotel using this method. Yet this claim was never put to the victim or Ms Nikmatul Husnah Binte Dol Rahim (“PW3”), the Assistant Front Office Manager of Conrad Centennial during the Prosecution’s case.

96     The accused’s claim was also not corroborated by DW2 who was with her during the hotel stay. Instead DW2 testified that on 11 December 2017, after leaving the hotel, he had dropped the victim off at their house and reminded the victim of the accused’s instructions to clean up the dirty laundry. When they returned home, DW2 gave evidence that he heard a commotion in the kitchen and the accused asking the victim why she had not cleaned their laundry after four to five hours in the house. This was clearly contrary to the accused’s claim that she had lost her voice and was using hand signs to communicate.

97     I further agreed with the Prosecution that another example can be seen from the Defence’s use of the photographs of the victim sleeping. During PW6’s cross-examination, they were used to make the point that the victim would often be caught sleeping instead of working or looking after the children. Yet, during the accused’s examination in chief, she asserted that the pictures were sent to PW6 as proof that the victim did not have to do any work whenever she was at the accused’s mother’s house. She could sleep and rest as and when she pleased.

#### The accused’s account was externally inconsistent

98     In addition to the internal inconsistencies in her evidence, I found that her account of certain events was contradicted by the Prosecution’s witnesses. PW3 had testified that the accused had checked into the hotel alone while her family waited separately at the lobby. In contrast, the accused claimed that her husband had assisted her as she had lost her voice. Nevertheless, PW3’s account was unchallenged during her cross-examination and it was not put to her that the accused had lost her voice.

99     The Defence had sought to rely on P43, the hotel invoices as proof that the accused’s family only left the hotel at 5:42pm after DW2 did his afternoon prayers. Nevertheless, PW3 explained that the accused had failed to check out at the front desk and had left their room before the hotel staff made the check at 3:00pm. She also explained that 5:42pm was the actual time when the hotel staff had manually checked them out as they had received no reply on the payment request from the accused. PW3’s evidence was similarly unchallenged.

100    The accused’s evidence was that the victim never slept on the carpet during her employment. Yet PW6 testified that when she spoke to the accused and reminded her to provide the victim with a mattress, the accused’s response was that it was the victim who preferred sleeping on the carpet.

101    Although it was the Defence’s case that the accused never spoke directly to the victim’s father, PW6 testified that the accused told her that she had called the accused’s family to inform them that if the victim were to return home, they would have to pay up on her loan. PW6 further testified that upon hearing this, she had chided the accused that she should not have contacted the victim’s family directly. This aspect of PW6’s evidence was not challenged by the Defence.

#### DW2 was an unreliable witness

102    In the present case, it was clear that DW2 was a partial witness whose evidence should be treated with caution. I found that he had made unnecessary jibes at the victim in his attempt to discredit her. In contrast, he repeatedly sought to cast his wife in good light claiming that she would give advice to the victim and took pity on her.

103    DW2 testified that he supported whatever rules and regulations given by his wife and gave examples of general rules like no sleeping in the aisleway, on the carpet and on the sofa. He told her not to sleep on the carpet or sofa because it would smell. This was to bolster the accused’s testimony that the victim had not slept on the carpet or the floor. Nevertheless, DW2 testified that the victim did sleep on the rug out of her own choice.

104    DW2 also testified that after the hotel stay, he has assisted his parents to check out of their room at about 2:00pm before applying for an extended checkout for his own room. According to him, at about 5:00pm he proceeded down to check with his credit card to the hotel counter to checkout of the room before leaving the hotel with his family and the victim. This is clearly inconsistent with the unchallenged objective evidence of PW3. In addition, this is also inconsistent with the accused’s account that they had opted for express checkout and she had left her debit card at the counter during the check in. As such, there was no need for them to personally check out at the counter.

### Impeachment proceedings

105    The Prosecution had applied to impeach the accused’s credit on account of the material inconsistencies between her testimony and her unchallenged long statement P47 that was recorded on 15 December 2017. These discrepancies have been summarised in a table below:

106    When the accused was given the opportunity to explain these material discrepancies, I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused was evasive and sought to proffer increasing outlandish explanations or them. In respect of the first discrepancy, she claimed that she was not the one who provided the information to the recorder, PW5.

107    In respect of the second discrepancy, she claimed that her statement was not 100% accurate and that there was a possibility that PW5 did not understand her as she was not fluent in English. She also claimed that PW5 had taken liberties with arranging her answers differently and would simply ignore what she said from the beginning.

108    In respect of the third discrepancy, she claimed she was actually referring to an occasion where the victim had bathed her children without a towel and instead used whatever clothes the children had worn to dry them. When confronted with the fact that her statement made express reference to how the victim dried herself without a towel, she claimed that the victim had demonstrated to her how to dry the body without a towel through the children.

109    In respect of the fourth discrepancy, in order to maintain consistency with her earlier accounts, she once again claimed that her answer must have been misunderstood by PW5 and the ‘lontong’ mentioned was in fact what she had purchased for herself and not her children.

110    In respect of the fifth discrepancy, she claimed that it was a previous incident and not specifically one on the 11 December 2017. On that day when they came back, she further claimed that she had only scolded the victim because she did not take out the clothing and wash them. When asked if she was claiming that the reference to the incident happening on the same day they returned from hotel did not come from her, she responded that she was not denying that this was her statement. She suggested that there may have been a misunderstanding.

111    The accused was unable to provide a clear explanation on why she had informed PW6 via WhatsApp message that upon their return from the hotel, the victim did not bathe and did not clean the house and only rushed out when the accused wanted to leave.

112    In respect of the sixth discrepancy, the accused claimed that when she used the word ‘carpet’, what she actually means was a mattress on top of a carpet.

113    Finally, in respect of the seventh discrepancy, she claimed that she had informed PW5 that she had witnessed this incident with her own eyes and claimed that he had misunderstood her.

114    In my view, when given the opportunity to explain the material discrepancies between her statement and her testimony, the accused had failed to provide a reasonable and credible explanations for these discrepancies. On the facts, after a careful consideration of the evidence before me, I did not accept the accused’s explanations in Court as regard the material inconsistencies as she was not a credible witness and found that her credit had been impeached.

115    For the above reasons, I rejected the accused’s defence as her evidence was inherently incredible, internally and externally inconsistent and as her credit had been impeached.

116    After having carefully considered the totality of the evidence as well as the submissions by both the Prosecution and the Defence, I was satisfied that at the Close of Defence that the Prosecution had established its case in respect of six out of the seven charges namely MAC 906529-2019, MAC 906530-2019, MAC 906532-2019, MAC 906533-2019, MAC 906534-2019 and MAC 906535 -2019 beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted her on the charges. As I was not satisfied that the amended third charge in MAC 906531-2019 had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, I ordered a discharge amounting to an acquittal in respect of this charge.

## Sentencing

### Prescribed Penalties

#### Penal Code offences

117    The prescribed penalty for the present charge of voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment of up to two years, or with a fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both. As the offence was committed against a domestic maid, s 73(2) of the Penal Code provides that the penalty is one and a half times the amount of punishment to which he would otherwise have been liable for that offence.

118    The prescribed penalty for an offence of using criminal force under s 352 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment of up to three months, or with a fine which may extend to $1,5000 or with both.

119    The prescribed penalty for an offence of criminal intimidation under the first limb of s 506 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment of up to two years, or with a fine or with both.

120    The prescribed penalty for an offence of criminal intimidation under the first limb of s 509 of the Penal Code is a term of imprisonment of up to one year, or with a fine or with both. As the offence was committed against a domestic maid, s 73(2) of the Penal Code provides that the penalty is one and a half times the amount of punishment to which he would otherwise have been liable for that offence.

#### EFMA offences

121    The prescribed penalty for an offence of ill-treating a foreign domestic employee under s 22(1)_(a)_ and punishable under s 22(1)(i) of the EFMA is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or to both.

## Antecedents

122    The Accused had no antecedents.

### Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

123    It was the Prosecution’s case that the protection of vulnerable domestic workers is a matter of public interest. Many of these workers, like the victim, come to Singapore in hopes of making an honest living. Yet, there has been an unsettling trend of these vulnerable individuals being subjected to relentless physical and psychological abuse in the confines of their employers’ homes. All domestic workers are deserving of dignity and respect; their abuse rightfully calls for deep public indignation. Public policy therefore demands that a deterrent approach be taken towards all cases of maid abuse.

124    It was submitted that the courts have long recognized domestic maids as a class of vulnerable individuals in need of especial protection under the law. It is for this reason that the courts are granted extended powers of punishment under s 73(2) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), to give full effect to the need for general deterrence in such cases of abuse (_See: Jayasankarr v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 4 SLR 1288</span> at \[3\]-\[4\].

125    It was the Prosecution’s case that the victim is a young individual who had just started working in Singapore for the first time. She did not have a local support network and spent almost all her time working within the confines of the accused’s household, without any off days. It was within this same household that the victim suffered silently at the hands of the accused. Moreover, like so many domestic workers before her, the victim had no real recourse for help, being constantly under the watchful eye of the accused and her family, without any independent means to seek assistance. Her isolation was further compounded by the accused’s repeated threats of harm to her family, and threats that her family would be saddled with a large debt should the victim attempt to leave. These threats weighed so heavily on the victim’s mind that she was initially too terrified to reveal what the accused had done to her, even when in the safe confines of the police station. The victim’s plight only serves to underscore the need for deterrent sentences to be imposed in cases like these.

126    Additionally, the principle of retribution must be given due weight in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused. The essence of the principle is that the offender must pay for what he has done: _ADF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> (“ADF”) 2 at \[65\]. There is, in addition, another aspect to the principle that must feature in cases such as the present: that being society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence for particular types of crime through the sentences imposed. The sentence meted out on the accused must therefore reflect the condemnation of the wider community for such abuse: ADF at \[67\].

#### Amended 1st Charge and Amended 2nd Charge

127    The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least seven months’ imprisonment in respect of the offence under s 509 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code with a short custodial term in respect of her offence under s 352 of the Penal Code.

#### Amended 4th Charge & Amended 5th Charge

128    The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least six months’ imprisonment for the offence under s 22(1)_(b)_ EFMA and at least two months’ imprisonment for the offence under s 506 of the Penal Code.

#### Amended 6th Charge

129    For the offence under s 323 read with s 73(2) Penal Code, the Prosecution sought a sentence of at least 15 months’ imprisonment.

#### Amended 7th charge

130    The Prosecution sought a sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment for the offence under s 22(1)_(b)_ and punishable under s 22(1)(i) EFMA.

#### Global sentence

131    It was submitted that the sentences for the charges in MAC 906529-2019, MAC 906532-2019 and MAC-906534-2019 should run consecutively, to give rise to a global sentence of 28 months’ imprisonment.

#### Compensation order

132    The Prosecution urged the Court to impose a global compensation order against the accused. It was submitted pursuant to s 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed), the court is required to consider whether or not to make an order for compensation. Such orders are generally a matter of course for cases of maid abuse, where it is impractical for the victim to commence a civil suit: _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHC 114</span>.

133    The breakdown of the individual order sought by the Prosecution are:

> (a)     $500 per charge for the 1st Charge (MAC-906529-2019), 4th Charge (MAC-906532-2019) and 6th Charge (MAC-906534-2019);

> (b)     $1,000 for the 5th Charge (MAC 906534-2019);

> (c)     $165 for the victim’s unpaid salary and lost earnings.

## Mitigation

134    The accused is 33 years old and married with twins aged 9 years old who are in Primary 3. She is presently unemployed and her husband works part-time as a security officer. Her parents are divorced and after her mother remarried, she has 5 step siblings. She resides with her family in a HDB flat at Tampines. Her highest level of education is a diploma in Business Administration.

#### Other relevant factors

135    It was submitted that the accused had to employ domestic helpers as both her children were premature babies. As her daughter was born with breathing difficulties, the doctor had diagnosed her as being critically ill. As such, she needed a domestic helper to look after the welfare of her children. Presently, her children are suffering from dyslexia.

136    At the material time, the accused was assisting her mother to run Malay wedding services. Her conviction has attracted adverse publicity and her livelihood has been severely affected. According to the Defence, she is now a housewife looking after two medically unfit children. Her life has taken a drastic turn, she is gripped with emotional agony and has sunk into depths of depression.

137    The accused is a first offender who has no previous convictions or antecedents and has maintained an unblemished record in the 33 years of her life. According to the Defence, this would be the first and her last brush with the law.

138    It was submitted that her whole family would suffer tremendous trauma and hardship (financial, emotional or otherwise) if she was too harshly dealt with. The fear she received from her arrest, police investigations and court hearings have completely shell shocked the accused. She pleads for leniency and mercy. She assures the Court she will be extra vigilant and not run afoul of the law again.

#### Submissions on sentence

139    The sentences proposed by the Defence were as follows:

> (a)     Amended 1st charge – eight weeks’ imprisonment;

> (b)     Amended 2nd charge – one week’s imprisonment;

> (c)     Amended 4th charge – one week’s imprisonment;

> (d)     Amended 5th charge – four weeks’ imprisonment;

> (e)     Amended 6th charge – three months’ imprisonment;

> (f)     Amended 7th charge – two week’s imprisonment.

140    In respect of the global sentence, the Defence had urged the Court to impose a global sentence of five months’ and one week’s imprisonment with the sentences for MAC-906529-2019, MAC 906532-2019 and MAC-906534-2019 to run consecutively with the remaining three charges to run concurrently.

## Decision on Sentence

### Sentencing principles for domestic maid abuse

141    In my consideration of the appropriate sentence to be imposed, I was conscious that the principles of deterrence and retribution take centre stage in domestic maid abuse cases. This was articulated by the Court of Appeal in _ADF v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 874</span> which observed as \[55\]:

>     In a case of domestic maid abuse, ordinarily, the principles of deterrence and retribution take precedence. A deterrent sentence signifies that there is a public interest to protect over and above the ordinary punishment of criminal behaviour. The protection of domestic maids from abuse by their employers is always a matter of public interest, given their vulnerable status and the prevalence of such relationships in Singapore. No employer or household member has the right to engage in abusive behaviour against a domestic maid. All maids should be treated fairly, with dignity and respect. Indeed, domestic maid abuse not only causes harm to the victim and calls for deep public indignation; it could also harm Singapore’s bilateral relations with other countries.

142    As such, custodial sentences are invariably the starting point for domestic maid abuse cases. Further, the Court of Appeal held in _ADF_ at \[91\]:

>     An employer’s unhappiness with a domestic maid’s work or conduct should never justify any form of abuse. All such offences are, in the eyes of the law, unprovoked.

143    As such, the victim’s inability to meet the accused’s expectation of her work performance and the victim’s level of personal hygiene did not justify or amount to a provocation of the abuse that the accused had subjected her to.

#### s 509 read with s 73(2) of the Penal Code

144    I agreed with the Prosecution that the present charge should be distinguished from the more common “peeping tom” cases prosecuted under s 509 Penal Code. Such cases are less aggravated and typically involve employers filming their domestic workers showering and generally attract sentences in the range of nine to 12 weeks’ imprisonment.

145    It was clear that the present case involved a far more aggravated and protracted intrusion into the victim’s privacy. The accused had forced the victim to strip naked, bathe and dry herself off in front of the accused. She was thereafter made to dress herself in a room with open windows as the accused sat on the mattress. The victim was acutely aware that she was being watched by her employer.

146    In my view, the accused had cruelly and deliberately stripped the victim of her modesty by subjecting her to such degrading acts. I accepted that this would have added to the psychological torment she experienced from this incident. I was mindful that the victim had testified in court that she had felt very humiliated and believed that she had lost her value as a result of this incident.

147    The Prosecution had sought a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment while the Defence had proposed a sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment which was the sentence for the more common peeping tom cases. In my view, the sentence proposed by the Defence was inadequate as the intrusion of the victim’s privacy was grave and the accused had taken deliberate steps to humiliate the victim despite being a woman herself. It was also evident that the accused had subjected the victim to such demeaning acts due to her underlying unhappiness with the victim’s body odour. I also took into account the fact that the victim who was then 19 years old can be considered as a fairly young victim. All things considered, I was of the view that a sentence of six months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances.

#### s 352 Penal Code

148    In respect of the s 352 Penal Code charge, the Prosecution had sought a short custodial sentence while the Defence had proposed a sentence of one week’s imprisonment. Both the Prosecution and the Defence agree that the custodial threshold had been crossed. Furthermore, in such instance of domestic maid abuse, a custodial sentence is the usual starting point.

149    I had considered that this was not an instance where the accused had simply pushed the victim once. Instead, the accused had persisted in her use of criminal force on the victim by not only pulling her arm but she also pushing the victim into the shower before spraying her with water while she was fully clothed.

150    I also considered the disparity in size between the victim and the accused as the accused was clearly much bigger than the victim who had been described as scrawny by PW7. It would have required some effort to resist the accused’s actions even if the victim had the presence of mind to do so. Having regard to the manner criminal force was used on the victim, I was of the view that a sentence of two week’s imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances.

#### s 22(1)(a) EFMA

151    In respect of the charge of ill-treating the victim, the Prosecution had sought a sentence of six months’ imprisonment while the Defence had proposed a sentence of one week’s imprisonment. In the present case, the accused had ill-treated the victim by pouring powder onto her face and causing some of the powder to enter her eyes thus causing her pain.

152    I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused’s actions carried with is potential for injury to the victim’s eyes, which are a vulnerable part of the victim’s body. In addition, the accused forbade the victim from removing the powder, forcing the victim to allow the powder to continue seeping into her eyes as they proceeded to the hotel, and causing her prolonged pain.

153    In addition, I was mindful that the accused had poured powder all over the victim’s face after remarking that the victim looked “ugly” and forcing the victim to maintain this appearance even after they left the house for the hotel. It was clear that the accused had done so to humiliate the victim as she would be amongst members of the public once they were at the hotel. Once again, the accused’s acts as set out above was a continuation of a broader pattern of demeaning and abusive conduct in her treatment of the victim.

154    In my view, the sentence of six months’ imprisonment was on excessive while the sentence of one week’s imprisonment proposed by the Defence was inadequate. Having regard to the degree of physical harm as well as the psychological harm caused, I was of the view that a sentence of three months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances.

#### s 506 Penal Code

155    In respect of the criminal intimidation charge, the Prosecution had sought for a sentence of two months’ imprisonment while the Defence had a proposed a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment. I was mindful that the accused’s act of threatening to harm the victim’s family in Lampung was a serious one and also not a one-off threat. The victim had testified in court, this was not the sole occasion that the accused had threatened harm to her family.

156    I agreed with the Prosecution that this was not a bare threat uttered on a whim – the accused had in fact told the victim that she had family in Lampung, which enhanced the fear created in the victim whom I observed to be timid, naïve and simple girl. As corroborated by both the victim’s agent and PW7, the accused’s threat had the lasting effect of deterring the victim from speaking out and making a report about the accused’s abuse for fear of her family’s safety. Given the aggravated nature of the accused’s offending, I agreed with the Prosecution that a custodial term of two months’ imprisonment was warranted on the facts.

#### s 323 read with s 73(2)Penal Code

157    For an offence under s 323 read with s 73(2) Penal Code, I was bound by the sentencing framework in _Tay Wee Kiat v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span> at \[70\] to \[75\] as follows:

> (a)      Step 1: Determine whether the harm caused to the victim is predominantly physical or both physical and psychological.

> (b)      Step 2: If the harm is both physical and psychological, the court should identify the degree of harm caused in relation to the charge under s 323 r/w s 73(2) Penal Code with regard to the following indicative ranges:

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="32.62%"> <col width="32.68%"> <col width="34.7%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">&nbsp;</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Less serious physical harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>More serious physical harm</b></p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>Less serious psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3–6 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6–18 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1"><b>More serious psychological harm</b></p></td><td align="left" class="r" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">6–18 months’ imprisonment</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">20–30 months’ imprisonment</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

> (c)      Step 3: To adjust the sentence to be imposed having regard to the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

158    Finally, I would have to determine which sentences should run consecutively and which concurrently.

159    The Prosecution had submitted that the present case fell under less serious physical harm and more serious psychological harm. Thus, the applicable indicative range is 6–18 months’ imprisonment. Consequently, the Prosecution sought a sentence of 15 months’ imprisonment as the offence warrants a sentence on the higher end of the band given:

> (a)     the humiliating and protracted nature of the accused’s assault (ripping open the victim’s shirt, mocking her when she tried to cover herself, and calling the victim “smelly”);

> (b)     the assault to vulnerable and sensitive regions of the victim’s body, namely, her breast and vagina;

> (c)     the fact that physical injury was in fact caused to the victim (tenderness to her right lower back, forearm tenderness and swelling, as well as contusions to the groin); and

> (d)     the use of an implement in relation to the accused’s act of closing the sliding cupboard door on the victim’s forearm.

160    In contrast, the Defence had sought a sentence of three months’ imprisonment which fell under less serious physical harm and less serious psychological harm indicative range of 3–6 months’ imprisonment.

161    I agreed with the Prosecution that the present case fell under less serious physical harm and more serious psychological harm. I was of the view that the appropriate starting point was 15 months’ imprisonment. After considering the fact that the accused was a first offender who faced one charge under s 323 r/w s 73(2) Penal Code unlike the offender in _Tay_ who faced multiple similar charges, I was of the view that a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate.

#### s 22(1)(a) EFMA

162    In respect of the charge of failing to grant the victim daily adequate rest, the Prosecution had sought for sentence of at least four months’ imprisonment while the Defence had proposed a sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment for this charge.

163    In the present case, the victim did not get adequate rest as she would wake up between 5:00 to 6:00am and would sleep at irregular hours depending on when the accused finished work. She was also to go to the accused’s mother’s house almost every day to care for the children when the accused and her husband were working and to return to the accused’s unit only at night. Once the accused’s family returned home between 10:00pm to 1:00am, she had to continue with her household chores before sleeping. Her lack of adequate rest is evident by the various photographs of the victim asleep in various locations that were included in P45.

164    Although the victim initially slept on the children’s pull-out bed at the start of her employment, thereafter she was made to sleep on the carpet in the children’s bedroom floor. As the accused was concerned that the carpet would smell, she was instructed by the accused to sleep on the floor outside the common toilet, although the victim decided to sleep underneath the cupboard in the living room instead.

165    In my view, a lack of adequate and proper means to rest was clearly detrimental to the victim’s health as well as a form of domestic maid abuse. Having regard to the degree of physical harm as well as the psychological harm caused, I agreed with the Prosecution that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment was just and appropriate in the circumstances.

### Global sentence

166    After having decided on the individual sentences, the next step was to decide on the global sentence. By virtue of section 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68 Rev Ed 2012), when a person is convicted and sentenced for at least three distinct offences, the court must order at least two sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively. As noted by the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat_ at \[75\]:

> 75    Having determined the sentences for each of the charges, the court then decides which sentences to run consecutively and which concurrently, in accordance with the principles set out in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[27\]–\[82\]. In particular, where an offender faces multiple charges of maid abuse, the court should take into account the duration and frequency of abuse in determining whether to order more than two sentences to run consecutively (see _ADF_ at \[146(a)\]).

167    In the present case, the Prosecution had sought a global sentence of at least 28 months’ imprisonment by having the sentences for MAC-906529-2019, MAC 906532-2019 and MAC-906534-2019 should run consecutively. In contrast, the Defence had urged the court to impose a global sentence of five months’ and one week’s imprisonment with a similar set of three charges to run consecutively.

168    In the present case, the victim was subjected to abuse by the accused over a period of two months. The abuse only stopped because the accused’s husband left the victim at the agency on 12 December 2017 and a police report was made. On a totality basis, I did not run the three longest imprisonment terms consecutively as it would be unduly crushing on the accused. I ordered the imprisonment terms in the 2nd, 4th and 6th charges to run consecutively. This would reflect the cumulative effect of the accused’s abuse of the victim without being unduly crushing on her.

169    Accordingly, I ordered the sentences for MAC-906530-2019, MAC 906532-2019 and MAC-906534-2019 to run consecutively in order to arrive at the global sentence of 15 months’ and two weeks’ imprisonment with the remaining charges in MAC-906529-2019, MAC 906533-2019 and MAC-906535-2019 to run concurrently. In my view, a term of 28 months’ imprisonment sought by the Prosecution is excessive having regard the totality principle and as the accused is a first offender. Nevertheless, a global sentence of five months’ and one week’s imprisonment sought by the Defence would not have adequately reflected the overall criminality of the accused’s conduct.

### Compensation

170    In my assessment of the present case, I agreed with the Prosecution that the victim ought to be compensated for the pain and suffering she underwent as a result of the offences in MAC 906529-2019, MAC 906532-2019, MAC 906533-2019 and MAC 906534-2019. In my determination of the appropriate amount to ordered against the accused, I was guided by the position taken by the High Court in the supplementary judgment of _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ SGHC 114 at \[19\] where a sum of $500 was determined to be a rough and ready starting point for each incident of abuse.

171    Pursuant to s 359 CPC and in line with the “rough and ready” approach adopted the High Court in _Tay Wee Kiat_, I ordered the accused to pay the following sums as compensation to the victim:

> (a)     $500 per charge for the MAC-906529-2019, MAC-906532-2019 and MAC-906534-2019;

> (b)     $1,000 for MAC 906533-2019 as I agreed with the Prosecution that a larger quantum of compensation is justified for this charge in view of the degree of harm suffered by the victim arising from this incident.

172    In my assessment, a global sum of $2,500 serves as adequate compensation to the victim for her pain and suffering. I considered the fact that since 12 December 2017, the victim has been staying at the Indonesian Embassy while awaiting the conclusion of the present matter. When asked as to whether she had sought any employment during this period, she stated that she did try but had not receive any police papers. No credible explanation was presented to the court for the duration of unemployment, bearing in mind that the victim of a tort ordinarily has a duty to mitigate. Accordingly, I declined to make any order for the unpaid salary and loss of earnings.
