Personal property – Chattels – Recovery – Former employee retaining possession of employer’s items

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in RAS 2/2020.\]

30 January 2020

### District Judge Lim Wen Juin:

1       The respondent was a former employee of the applicant company. It was not disputed that following the termination of the respondent’s employment on 27 June 2019 he did not return to the applicant a number of items that it had issued to him in the course of his employment (“the Items”), namely:

> (a)     A Dell laptop referred to as the “Old Dell Laptop”;

> (b)     The accessories of another Dell laptop referred to as the “New Dell Laptop”;

> (c)     An iPhone 6S (“the iPhone”);

> (d)     An access card to the applicant’s office in Germany; and

> (e)     Medical and dental cards issued to the respondent’s spouse.

2       Consequently the applicant sought in this application filed on 28 August 2019 a declaration that the respondent had “wrongfully retained possession” of the Items, as well as an order for delivery up of the Items. The applicant also sought an injunction restraining the respondent from “disclosing, using, and/or otherwise dealing with any data and/or information contained” in the Old Dell Laptop and the iPhone.

3       When parties attended before me on 14 January 2020 Mr Walter Ferix Silvester, counsel for the respondent, sought an adjournment of the hearing on the basis that the respondent had just days before filed an application (by way of District Court Summons No. 93 of 2020 (“SUM 93/2020”)) seeking leave to file a further affidavit and to cross-examine the individual who had affirmed the affidavits filed on the applicant’s behalf. But I declined to adjourn the hearing because I was not persuaded that the factual points that the respondent wished to address by way of further affidavit and cross-examination were material to the determination of the applicant’s claims (I elaborate on this later). Thus I proceeded to hear the application and at the conclusion of the hearing I granted the applicant all of the relief that it sought, save that I allowed the respondent seven days for delivery up of the Items. The respondent has appealed against my decision and so I set out my reasons in writing below.

4       I might mention here that in his reply affidavit the respondent had advanced several counterclaims against the applicant, including claims for reinstatement of his employment with the applicant and for “retrenchment compensation”. But when I heard parties on 14 January 2020 Mr Silvester informed me that the respondent wished to maintain pursuit of only two of the counterclaims. I duly dealt with these counterclaims at the hearing. It seems from the notice of appeal that the respondent is not appealing against my decision on the counterclaims and so I touch on this only briefly, as follows. One of the counterclaims was for payment in lieu of time off-in-lieu for work done outside of office hours. I dismissed this because it appeared from the employment contract that the respondent was not entitled to any overtime pay in addition to his monthly salary even if he worked beyond office hours. The other was for reimbursement of various business expenses that the respondent said he had incurred while employed by the applicant. I did not think that there was sufficient evidence in the affidavits to support this counterclaim. But I was not inclined to dismiss it outright because Mr Koong Len Sheng, counsel for the applicant, suggested at the hearing that the applicant might in principle be prepared to reimburse the respondent for those expenses that were satisfactorily supported by documentary proof, and given that the total sum claimed was in the region of S$4,500 I thought that the cost of requiring the respondent to bring a separate action in respect of the counterclaim would be disproportionate to the sum claimed. Accordingly I adjourned this counterclaim and directed that parties write in by 11 February 2020 to inform me whether they are able to resolve it between themselves and, if not, how they wish to proceed with it.

5       Returning to the applicant’s claims in respect of the Items, it was clear to me that the applicant had issued the Old Dell Laptop, the New Dell Laptop and its accessories, the iPhone and the access card to the respondent in order that he might use them to carry out the duties of his employment. It was equally clear that the medical and dental cards had been issued to the respondent’s spouse as a benefit of the respondent’s employment with the applicant. This being the case, when the applicant gave the respondent possession of the Items it could not possibly have meant to relinquish ownership of the Items to him. Rather, ownership of the Items was to remain with the applicant, and all that had been conferred on the respondent was the right to possess the Items for as long as the applicant permitted it in the context of the relationship between them of employer and employee.

6       I did not think it could be disputed that the applicant had on 27 June 2019 validly terminated the respondent’s employment with immediate effect by paying him two months’ salary in lieu of notice in accordance with cl 12.1 (read with cl 1.3) of the employment contract. Given my view that the respondent’s right to have possession of the Items was wholly derived from his being employed by the applicant, I thought that the effect of this termination was that, absent any other arrangement between them, the respondent could not possibly have any better right to possess the Items than the applicant had as the owner of the Items. This being so, it seemed to me that the respondent was obliged to return the Items to the applicant unless he could demonstrate any understanding to the contrary between them.

7       In relation to the accessories of the New Dell Laptop, I did not understand the respondent to have put forward any real basis for retaining possession of them. Hence I thought that the applicant was entitled to a declaration that the respondent had “wrongfully retained possession” of these accessories and a corresponding order for delivery up. As for the access card and the medical and dental cards, it was not disputed that they had been “cancelled and/or disabled” by the applicant. But I could not see how this was a reason for the respondent to retain possession of these cards. I thought that the cards remained unquestionably the property of the applicant and that the respondent was thus obliged to return them to the applicant however worthless they might be in his hands. I therefore thought it right to grant the declaration and order for delivery up sought by the applicant in respect of the access card and the medical and dental cards.

8       In relation to the iPhone, the respondent contended that he and the applicant had agreed that he could keep it. In his affidavits the respondent explained that he had had a discussion about the iPhone with a member of the applicant’s Human Resource staff named Ms Christina Lim. In one of his affidavits the respondent said that he and Ms Lim had agreed that he would “retain the said 4-year old iPhone at net book value after depreciation”, and that Ms Lim had “added that she would inform \[him\] of the net cost payable from \[him\], if any”. In another affidavit the respondent said that he and Ms Lim had agreed that he would “retain the old iPhone at net book value”, and that he had “informed Ms Lim to offset the net book value of the old iPhone against the payment in-lieu of notice” that was due to him. According to the respondent Ms Lim then told him that she “will check with the finance department on the net book value and will revert \[_sic_\] on the cost to \[him\]”, and his response to her was that this was “unnecessary as the value was unlikely to be much”.

9       It seemed to me that on the respondent’s own version of events there had been no agreement between him and the applicant that he could keep the iPhone. I thought it clear that the respondent and Ms Lim had not agreed on what the “net book value” of the iPhone was: he might have thought that it was effectively zero but she was evidently not prepared to accept this assessment without first checking with the applicant’s finance department. Thus it seemed to me that there was a crucial term of the alleged agreement that remained unresolved between the respondent and the applicant. This term, concerning as it did the value or price of the very item that was the subject of the alleged agreement, was in my opinion a fundamental enough term that it meant that there was from an objective perspective no agreement between the parties that the respondent could keep the iPhone. I was therefore compelled to the conclusion that the applicant continued to be the owner of the iPhone and was entitled to its return, and that the respondent had “wrongfully retained possession” of the iPhone.

10     This left for consideration the Old Dell Laptop. This was by far the most keenly contested of the Items. The essence of the respondent’s case on this score was that the Old Dell Laptop contained evidence of unusual activity that at the very least warranted further investigation. According to the respondent this activity comprised what he suspected to be a “potentially unauthorised and illegal intrusion” into the Old Dell Laptop (and the New Dell Laptop) that involved the “destruction” of e-mails and folders and files on both laptops. The respondent further alleged that what had been destroyed or “deleted” was evidence of wrongdoing within the applicant (and the group of companies to which it belonged) that might rise to the level of criminal offences, including “falsifying project cost estimates” and “inflating” reported earnings. The respondent strenuously argued that as a former employee of the applicant in its internal audit department he had legal and ethical obligations to look into any evidence of misfeasance he might encounter, and in retaining possession of the Old Dell Laptop all he had done was to comply with those obligations.

11     Not unexpectedly the applicant did not accept the correctness of the respondent’s allegations about unusual activity on the Old Dell Laptop (and the New Dell Laptop) and the underlying wrongdoing that the activity was meant to conceal. But I did not think it at all necessary to decide whether there was substance in the respondent’s allegations. Even accepting that the respondent had acted in accordance with his legal and ethical obligations in investigating unusual activity on his laptops, and that there was some basis for suspecting that corporate misfeasance had occurred within the applicant, I could not see how that afforded him a legal basis for retaining possession of the Old Dell Laptop to the exclusion of the applicant given that the Old Dell Laptop was undoubtedly the property of the applicant. I thought that if I declined to grant the declaration and make the order for delivery up sought by the applicant it would amount to a decision that the respondent was entitled indefinitely to retain possession of property owned by another, and I was simply unable to see how that could be right in principle.

12     It appeared to me that, at bottom, the respondent wished to persuade the court that he had behaved throughout as an honest and diligent whistle-blower. This was apparent not only from his affidavits but also from the interlocutory applications that he filed. I made mention previously of his application in SUM 93/2020 for leave to file a further affidavit and to cross-examine the deponent of the applicant’s affidavits. At the hearing on 14 January 2020 Mr Silvester explained that the purpose of that application was to adduce evidence of the respondent’s legal and ethical duties as an employee and internal auditor, and of the suspected corporate wrongdoing that the respondent wished to expose. Mr Silvester added that the respondent very much wanted the court to see that what he had done was “not wrong”. Earlier the respondent had filed an application (by way of District Court Summons No. 4403 of 2019) to convert the proceedings in the main application to a writ action (or more precisely, to have the proceedings continue as if the matter “had been begun by writ” pursuant to O 28 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5)), and the ground of that application was that there were “substantial disputes of fact” concerning the “Suspected Intrusion” on both the Old Dell Laptop and the New Dell Laptop. I heard and dismissed the application on 20 December 2019. The reason why I dismissed it, and the reason why I was not prepared to adjourn the hearing on 14 January 2020 to await a fuller examination of SUM 93/2020, was that I could not see how these matters of fact were relevant to the determination of the applicant’s claims for relief. If the respondent were indeed a whistle-blower he is doubtless to be commended from a moral and ethical point of view, but I could not see how an ethical duty to blow the whistle on misfeasance could translate into a private citizen’s legal right to retain possession of property owned by another where the owner demands its return. The court is not a forum for parties to vindicate themselves and justify their conduct where that has no bearing on their legal rights and obligations. I thought that if the Old Dell Laptop did contain evidence that criminal offences had been committed the proper course would be to leave it to the official authorities to exercise their investigative powers as they deem fit. Hence I thought the applicant entitled to an order for delivery up of the Old Dell Laptop and a declaration that the respondent had “wrongfully retained possession” of it – “wrongfully” meaning only that the respondent did so without any legal basis. I am not in any position to say whether the respondent was morally or ethically correct to have done so.

13     Turning at last to the application for an injunction restraining the respondent from “disclosing, using, and/or otherwise dealing with any data and/or information contained” in the Old Dell Laptop and the iPhone, cl 15 of the employment contract provided that the respondent “shall observe utmost confidentiality and secrecy of all information received by \[him\] or entrusted to \[him\] in the course of \[his\] employment”, and that this “restriction shall continue to apply after the termination of \[his\] employment without limit in point of time” except in respect of information already in the public domain. Widely drafted as this clause was I did not see any reason not to give full effect to it. Given that the Old Dell Laptop and the iPhone were issued to the respondent in order that he might use them to carry out the duties of his employment, I thought it followed that all data and information on those devices would constitute information “received by \[the respondent\] or entrusted to \[him\] in the course of \[his\] employment”, and thereby constitute information to be kept confidential and secret even beyond the termination of his employment with the applicant, unless the respondent could positively show that any particular piece of information on the Old Dell Laptop and iPhone had not been so received by or entrusted to him. The respondent did not suggest that there was any information in those devices that was of a purely personal nature unrelated to his employment, and so I thought that all the data and information therein was confidential and that it was appropriate to enjoin the respondent from disclosing, using or otherwise dealing with it. In granting the injunction I expressly clarified that it did not prevent the respondent from bringing the data and information in the Old Dell Laptop and the iPhone to the official authorities solely for the purpose of allowing potential allegations of illegal activity to be investigated. I understood Mr Koong to accept this on the applicant’s behalf.

14     Having determined this application in the applicant’s favour, I thought that the respondent’s application in SUM 93/2020 was rendered academic. I dismissed it accordingly.
