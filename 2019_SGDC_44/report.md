#### First Information Report

7       On 23 May 2013, at about 4.43 am, the complainant called for the police and reported that “_a group of Malays are beating up somebody. I do not know if ambulance \[required\]_”. The incident location given was the Singapore Flyer, located at 30 Raffles Avenue, Singapore (“Singapore Flyer”).

8       Investigations revealed that on 23 May 2013, at about 4 am, the accused persons had been drinking at Club Shake, at the Singapore Flyer. At about 4.40am, A1 was coming out of a toilet located at the same place. B2 was walking to the said toilet at this point. Upon seeing A1, B2 confronted him and asked A1 if he was the person who had fought with him about a week back. Before A1 could reply, B2 threw a punch at A1’s face. A1 therefore started to back away from B2. The accused and B3 to B6, who had been standing outside Club Shake witnessed this altercation and walked over to join B2.

9       A1 tried to run away from the accused persons, but they gave chase. The accused managed to catch up with A1 and started to rain several punches and kicks at him. B2 to B5 also joined in on the attack. At this juncture, A2 tried to intervene and stop the accused persons from attacking A1. However, amidst the scuffle, he was punched in the face by one of the accused persons, and fell to the ground as a result.

10     An employee of Club Shake witnessed the assault and ran out, shouting “_call police_”. The accused persons heard this and quickly left the location. Police officers subsequently arrived to render assistance to A1 and A2. A1 and A2 were thereafter conveyed to Singapore General Hospital for treatment.

11     A medical report by Dr. Li Xinyi stated that A1 suffered the following injuries: -

·    a parietal scalp laceration measuring about 5 x 2 cm;

·    a left cheek laceration measuring 2cm deep till fat;

·    a superficial laceration behind left ear measuring 1cm;

·    a left forehead laceration measuring 1cm;

·    abrasion on bilateral palms, right dorsum of foot and left toes; and

·    chipped front teeth.

12     A1 was discharged with analgesics and given a follow-up appointment at the Plastics Specialist Outpatient Clinic.

13     A medical report by Dr. Lau Hong Khai stated that A2 suffered a 1.5cm superficial laceration on his right face for which suturing had been done. He was discharged with analgesia and granted 3-days medical leave, with a follow-up appointment.

#### Facts pertaining to the 2nd Charge (DAC-923981-2018: VCGH with Dangerous Weapon)

14     The victims are as follows: -

(A3)     Ng Yong June, a male aged 22 years old. He was 16 years old and a student at the time of the incident.

(A4)     Kishen Dev s/o Shio Kumar, a male aged 24 years old. He was 18 years old and a student at the time of the incident.

15     The witnesses are as follows: -

(A5)     Muhammad Rifqi Bin Mohamed Ramzan, a male aged 22 years old.

(A6)     Muhammad Raidi Bin Mohamed Ramzan, a male aged 21 years old. A6 is A5’s younger brother.

#### First Information Report

16     On 23 August 2013, at 8.06pm, the police received a ‘999’ call with the following report “_I think there is a gang fight under the block_”. The incident location given was Block 637 Yishun Street 61, Singapore (the incident location).

#### Facts Relating to the Charge

17     Investigations revealed that prior to the incident, on 17 August 2013, A3, A4 and their friends had taken part in a soccer tournament at Woodlands Community Centre. A3 and A4’s team played against A5’s team. After the game, A5 approached A3 and asked him if he had problem with them. A3 denied having any problem with A5 and his friends and walked off.

18     On 23 August 2013, at about 1.00pm, A6 received a conference call from his friend. A4 was also on the conference call. During the call, vulgarities were exchanged between A4 and A6. A6 then complained to A5 that A4 had scolded their mother. A5 then contacted A4 and vulgarities were once again exchanged during this phone call. Thereafter, A5 and A4 arranged for a “_settlement talk_” at the incident location, at 8pm on the same day. A5 then contacted the accused, and another two friends to accompany him to the “_settlement talk_”.

19     On 23 August 2013, at about 8.00pm, the accused, A5, and their two friends drove to the open carpark beside the incident location. When they alighted, they noticed A4 walking towards Block 638 Yishun Street 61 alone. The accused then asked A5 if A4 was the one who had used vulgarities on him. A5 confirmed this. The accused then went up to A4 and confronted him, before punching him once on the head

20     Upon being confronted, A4 fled to Block 638 Yishun Street 61, whilst the accused, A5 and their two friends gave chase. A3 was also in the vicinity and spotted the group chasing A4. At this juncture, the accused saw A3 and A5 had identified him as A4’s friend. The accused therefore charged towards him, and started slashing at him with a chopper. A3 raised his hands to shield his face from the accused’s attack and got slashed on both his hands as a result. A3’s friends, who were at a nearby soccer court, saw A3 being attacked and quickly ran over to intervene. Seeing this, the accused, A5 and their two friends quickly left the scene. The said chopper was not recovered.

21     Police resources thereafter arrived on scene and A3 was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. A medical report put up by Dr. Vaikunthan Rajaratnam indicated the following:

a)     A3 had to undergo a first surgery on 24 August 2013. He was found to have complex injury involving both his wrists with open fracture and injury to the extensor tendon of the hands. His right hand had a fracture of the 4th metacarpal neck, which had to be fixed with screws and a plate. The wound also had to be debrided. His left hand had multiple extensor tendon lacerations. His left hand wound was cleaned, but repair was not yet complete.

b)     A3 underwent a second surgery on 30 August 2013. His left hand wound was found to have division of nearly all the extensor tendons. These were repaired and some had to be reconstructed by transplanting tendon from the front of the hand.

22     A3 informed that he was given 43 days’ hospitalization leave. He was discharged with outpatient follow-up treatment and therapy. The said medical report indicated that he would have permanent disability in his hands as a result of the injuries.

23     A3 has also informed that to date, almost six years after the attack, he does not have full control of the fingers in his left hand. The flexibility and strength of his hands have also been adversely affected by the injuries caused, and this has impacted his day-to-day life.

#### Facts pertaining to the 6th and 7th Charges (DAC-929817/18-2018: Failure to Report for Urine Test)

#### First Information Report

24     On 11 August 2014, CNB officer Yap Hon Chian lodged a police report stating that the accused has failed to report for his urine tests at Jurong Police Division since 23 June 2014.

#### Facts relating to the Charges

25     On 29 January 2013, the accused was placed on drug supervision for 24 months pursuant to Regulation 15 of the MDR Regulations . The accused’s supervision period was from 29 January 2013 to 28 January 2015. Pursuant to the Regulations, the accused is required to present himself for a urine test at Jurong Police Division every Monday of each month from 9.30am to 10.00pm commencing on 26 March 2013. However, he failed to report for his urine tests on 30 occasions.

26     The accused contravened the said Regulations when he failed to present himself for urine tests on 19 January 2015 and 26 January 2015 without any valid reasons. He absconded whilst on court bail on 21 April 2014. The accused was only re-arrested on 18 July 2018.

## The Sentence

28     The accused has been convicted of 1 count of unlawful assembly under section 143 of the Penal Code where the prescribed punishment is imprisonment which may extend to 2 years or with a fine or with both. In respect of the offence under section 326 of the same code of having voluntarily caused grievous hurt, the punishment is imprisonment up to 15 years and the accused is also liable to a fine or caning. He has also been convicted on 2 counts for failure to report for urine tests under the MDR and the punishment for this offence is imprisonment for a period of up to 4 years’ imprisonment or a fine of $10,000 or both.

29     In their address on sentence the prosecution, citing a number of aggravating factors, submitted for a global sentence of at least 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment and 9 strokes of the cane. This would mean a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment for the section 143 offence, similarly 4 months’ imprisonment for the failure to report for urine tests, 5 years’ imprisonment with 9 strokes of the cane for the section 326 offence and with 3 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively. The accused, in the written plea in mitigation, tendered by his counsel, pleaded with the court to show leniency and compassion. Citing his current situation where he is now married with a young child, his counsel submitted that the accused was remorseful, had felt guilty having evaded punishment for the last 4 years and was willing to face his punishment.

30     I shall deal first with the section 326 offence of voluntarily having caused grievous hurt as it is the most serious offence and the main focus of the prosecution’s address on sentence. The accused committed this offence on the 23 of August, 2013. By then he had already committed the offence of being a member of an unlawful assembly under section 143 on the 23 of May, 2013. The records showed that he was produced in court on the 25 of May, 2013, just 2 days later and released on court bail on the 3of June, 2013. This would mean that he committed the section 326 offence while on court bail and just 3 months after the section 143 offence, which is violent in nature too.

31     The commission of offences while on court bail is indeed an aggravating factor. (See _PP v Loqmanul Hakim Bin Buang_ ). In the case of _Loo Pei Xiang Alan v PP_ , (at paragraph 29), the learned Judge of Appeal, Justice Chao Hick Tin opined as such when he said:

“_In my judgment, there is only one good reason for elevating the appellant’s sentence beyond the indicative starting point – which is very close to or at the mandatory minimum of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane –_ **_and it is the fact that he committed the offences while out on bail. It demonstrates a disregard for the law and a recalcitrance that calls for an increased sentence on principles of specific deterrence and prevention_**.” (emphasis added).

32     The accused was then charged for the section 326 offence on the 26 September 2013 and released again on court bail on the 3 October 2013. Thereafter, he did not plead guilty but chose to abscond on the 21 April 2014. He remained at large for almost 4 years until he was arrested on the 17 July, 2018. The accused’s conduct demonstrates clearly that he was not remorseful and although he claimed that he chose to return to Singapore on the date he was re- arrested, I did not consider this to be mitigating in nature.

33     Turning to the offence itself, the victim, A3, a young 16 year old teenager at the material time, sustained serious and severe injuries to his hands which required two major surgeries to repair. After 43 days of hospitalization leave, there was follow-up treatment and therapy, but he did not recover fully and he sustained a permanent disability[\[note: 1\]](#Ftn_1) as a result of the injuries. Although almost six years have elapsed after the incident, the victim is unable to exercise full control over the fingers of his left hand, and the flexibility and strength of both his hands have also been adversely affected by the injuries caused. It cannot be denied that this has significantly impacted the victim’s daily life.

34     It would appear that the offence was triggered by an earlier dispute between the accused’s brother, A5, and the victim’s friend, one A4 after a soccer match. The accused was not a party to this dispute and was not even present. A5 then arranged for a settlement talk with A4 which was attended by the accused and 2 other friends. At this settlement talk, the violence was initiated by the accused who first punched A4. The victim appears to be an unfortunate victim as he spotted the group, including the accused, chasing A4. This was when the accused slashed the victim with a chopper, a sharp and deadly weapon. Clearly this was a revenge attack by the accused and his friends which was pre-meditated and planned as the accused came to the supposedly settlement talk armed with a chopper. There can be no other explanation for the fact that he brought the chopper to the talk except that he must have intended to use it. I agree with the prosecution that the unwarranted savagery of his attack on the defenceless A3 is highly aggravating in this case and it is also relevant that the victim was vulnerable, given that he was only 16 years old when he was attacked.

35     In the table of sentencing precedents submitted by the prosecution, I note that where a chopper was used and the victim sustained significant injuries, including a permanent disability, the sentences imposed ranged between 4 years to 5 years’ imprisonment and with 6 to 9 strokes of the cane. Considering that these cases did not involve offenders who committed the offence while on court bail and who later absconded for a substantial period of time, I had no hesitation in accepting the prosecution’s submission for a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment with 9 strokes of the cane. Nevertheless, exercising some leniency towards the accused as he was relatively youthful at the material time and in spite of the fact that he had a relevant antecedent as he had committed robbery with hurt in 2007, I reduced the strokes and imposed a sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane.

36     In so far as the section 143 offence of being a member of an unlawful assembly is concerned, the norm is also imprisonment and the length would be dependent on the size of the group, the nature of the object, the extent to which the object was carried out, the present or potential danger of injury inherent and the level of violence, if any. (See Sentencing Practice in the Sub Courts, 3rd Ed at page 363).

37     From the SOF, it appeared that the attack by the accused’s group started when B2 confronted A1, the first victim and enquired whether he had fought with him in the past. A1 was not given an opportunity to respond as B2 punched him immediately. The accused and the rest of the accomplices joined in this attack on A1. The accused played an active role as he chased A1, caught up with him and “_rain several punches and kicks at him_.[\[note: 2\]](#Ftn_2)” When A2 tried to help A1 from being assaulted, he was attacked by the group. The object here was to just inflict violence on 2 victims who had done nothing to provoke the attack. It was protracted in nature as the accused persons chased A1 when he attempted to flee, and had stopped A2 from helping his friend.

38     It was not disputed that both victims suffered injuries, which while not life threatening were not minor either. A1 suffered several lacerations, some of which were relatively deep, concentrated on his head and face, as well as chipped teeth. A2’s laceration on his face was also serious, as seen from the fact that suturing was required. Under these circumstances, I was of the view that the accused ought to be imprisoned too for this offence.

39     I was informed that the co-accused persons who had been dealt with and received imprisonment terms were (B2) Muhammad Aliff Bin Ahmad and (B4) Kashful Azeez Bin Sarrip and they were sentenced to 4 months’ and 3 months’ imprisonment respectively. They had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity in 2013-2014, which was months after the incident. This is obviously starkly different from the accused as there has been an extensive delay which was solely caused by him as he had jumped bail. An uplift of the imprisonment term is justified and the accused ought to receive a term of imprisonment exceeding 4 months. Nevertheless, again exercising some leniency in his favour, I merely imposed a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment for this charge of unlawful assembly under section 143 in order to maintain parity with B2’s sentence.

40     With regard to the offences of failing to report for urine tests, which the accused was subjected to, pursuant to the supervision order made on 29 January 2013, I took into account the fact that a drug supervision order is one of many measures enacted under the Law to ensure that drug addicts do not return to their habits of abusing drugs. Drug activities are regarded as a dreaded scourge and the predominant interest is the protection of society from the menace and social evils associated with drug abuse. Deterrence therefore takes centre stage in determining the appropriate sentence for offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act and its regulations.

41     In this case, the accused has not complied with the supervision order as he was on the run from the law, which is simply not an acceptable reason. While the prosecution has proceeded only on 2 charges, the accused has admitted that he failed to report for his urine tests on 30 occasions. The sentencing norm is a sentence of 4 to 6 months’ imprisonment for first time offenders, a category in which the accused belonged to. Considering that there is a similar charge which was TIC, I was minded to impose a sentence in the higher end of the range as a stiff sentence was necessary to deter the accused and other likeminded persons from blatantly ignoring the supervision order, to ensure that efforts to deal effectively with recalcitrant drug offenders are not compromised. However, again exercising some leniency towards him I accepted the prosecution’s submission for a 4-month imprisonment term for this offence.

42     In summary, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of this case, I sentenced the accused as follows:

43     In compliance with section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which required at least 2 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively, as the accused has now been sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, I ordered 3 terms of imprisonment to run consecutively. This is warranted since the offences were committed on 3 different dates, they are 3 distinct offences and they protected separate legal interests. These were the terms of imprisonment for the section 326, the section 143 and one of the failure to report for urine test offences, yielding a total sentence of 5 years and 8 months’ imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. This sentence adequately reflects the accused’s culpability and cannot be considered as manifestly excessive.

44     The accused is currently serving his sentence which was backdated to his date of remand, namely the 20 July 2018.
