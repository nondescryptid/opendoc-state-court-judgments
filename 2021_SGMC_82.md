### District Judge May Lucia Mesenas:

## Introduction

1       The accused, 30 years old and Zahira Begum d/o Osman Aboo Bakar (“the victim”), 29 years old, were husband and wife at the material time. They have a child to the marriage, namely, “Z”.

2       The accused, claimed trial to two charges, namely, that of voluntarily causing hurt to the victim, by slapping the victim three times and twisting her arm, consequently causing a comminuted right distal humerus fracture, which offence is punishable under section 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) (“voluntarily causing hurt charge”) and that of acting rashly as to endanger the personal safety of Z, who was about five months old at that time by slapping the victim while she was carrying the said infant in her arms, consequently hitting the said infant’s head as well, which offence is punishable under section 336(a) PC (“rash act charge”).

3       The accused was convicted on both charges and sentenced to serve five months’ imprisonment for the voluntarily causing hurt charge and one week’s imprisonment for the rash act charge. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently, resulting in a global sentence of five months’ imprisonment. The accused has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. He is currently on bail pending the appeal.

## Charges

4       The accused was convicted on the following two charges after the trial:

> **_MAC 906759-2019_**

> You \[..\] are charged that you on the 15th day of December 2018 at or about 1.35pm, at Block 659 Choa Chu Kang Crescent, #XXX, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Zahira Begum d/o Osman Aboo Bakar, _to wit_, by slapping the said Zahira Begum d/o Osman Aboo Bakar 3 times and subsequently twisting her right arm, consequently causing a comminuted right distal humerus fracture, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

> **_MAC 906760-2019_**

> You\[..\] are charged that you, on the 15th day of December 2018 at or about 1.35pm, at Block 659 Choa Chu Kang Crescent #XXX, Singapore, did perform an act so rashly as to endanger the personal safety of one (..), a male infant who was about 5 months old at that time, _to wit_, by slapping one Zahira Begum d/o Osman Aboo Bakar, while she was carrying the said infant in her arms, consequently hitting the said infant’s head as well, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 336(a) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.

## Undisputed facts

5       The accused and the victim were married sometime in 2017 and Z was born on 4 July 2018. He was about five months old at the material time. They were staying at Blk 659 Choa Chu Kang Crescent, #XXX (“matrimonial home”), the location where the offences took place.

6       On 15 December 2018, the accused and the victim had intended to go to the accused’s younger brother’s house-warming party (“house-warming function”) with their son, Z. The accused’s older brother, namely, Saalai Mohd Ibrahim Hithayatullah Bin Abdul Mutalib (“DW2”), was picking them up on that day. Prior to being picked up by DW2, both parties were getting ready. The accused and the victim had a dispute regarding the washing of Z’s milk bottle.

7       It was undisputed that the accused caused the victim to sustain a comminuted distal humerus fracture (see victim’s medical report in “P4”), following which the victim had to undergo surgery at the material time. Her post-operative recovery was complicated by ‘wrist drop’, which developed on the night of the surgery. She was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”) from 15 December 2018 and discharged on 27 December 2018. She was subsequently on hospitalisation leave from 27 December 2018 to 27 June 2019.

8       Dr Benjamin Ang, associate consultant orthopaedic surgeon from the SGH (“PW3”), testified that the victim had lost some function of her radial nerve temporarily, thereby causing her to have difficulty extending the wrist and fingers[^1]. In a letter dated 9 May 2019 (“P2”), PW3 stated that the victim was able to perform computer work but should not be carrying loads. Even on the first day of trial on 13 August 2020, the victim was still debilitated by the injury in so far as the movement of her arm was limited due to pain. She was unable to demonstrate with her right arm how the accused had twisted her arm. The medical fees incurred amounted to $11,246.22, of which $8,409.44 was covered by the victim’s insurance plans.

9       During the trial, the victim was still unable to rest her right arm on the desk for a very long time. She also sustained a ‘frozen shoulder’ where she was unable to raise her right arm.

10     Upon discharge from SGH on 27 December 2018, the victim stayed in her parents’ place at Blk 27 Telok Blangah Way until 5 January 2019. Z was staying with her during that same period after the accused dropped Z off at her parents’ place on 27 December 2018. After the incident, she did not inform her parents of what exactly transpired during the incident and only informed that the injury was sustained when the accused and victim ‘were playing[^2]’.

11     Thereafter, from 5 January 2019, the victim moved back to her matrimonial home to stay with the accused, together with Z until 13 January 2019 where the accused celebrated the victim’s birthday at their matrimonial home. As Z was feeling unwell, the victim went back to her parents’ place together with Z, on the evening of 13th January 2019 after her birthday celebration as the victim felt that there would be better care in her parents’ place. On 18 January 2019, both the accused and victim had dinner at Pastamania in Vivocity to discuss about their marital issues. The victim and Z continued to stay at the victim’s parents place up and including the time the police report was made on 22 January 2019.

12     On 22 January 2019, both the accused and the victim had an argument as evidenced in the WhatsApp messages exchanged between parties (see “D4”), regarding the victim’s father smoking in front of Z.

### Police report lodged on 22 January 2019

13     A police report was made by the victim on 22 January 2019 (“P1”), pertaining to the incident which took place on 15 December 2018 in their matrimonial home, stating that she had an argument with the accused in relation to their son in their room, following which the accused ‘beat’ her while she was carrying their son. Thereafter, she left the room and sat on the sofa with their son. She also stated that the accused twisted her arm and leaned forward, resulting in the ‘breaking’ of her ‘humerus bone’ on her ‘dominant right arm’. In the same report, the victim stated that she would like to apply for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the accused and his family as she was afraid that the accused would harm her and their son once she went back home.

### Divorce proceedings commenced after 2 February 2019

14     Divorce proceedings had commenced sometime after 2 February 2019 when a dispute occurred between the victim’s parents and the accused’s parents where the latter insisted on seeing Z and claimed that Z belonged to them and was their ‘heir’. A scuffle involving the accused, his father and the victim’s father took place at the void deck of the victim’s parents’ residence on 2 February 2019 where the accused and his father pushed the victim’s father to the ground. According to the victim, the accused’s father was behaving aggressively towards the victim’s father. The commotion was captured on video, which was recorded by the victim’s elder sister, where it also captured DW2 ‘wanting to hit’ the victim’s father[^3]. Following this incident, the victim commenced divorce proceedings as she did not feel safe for herself or her son, Z[^4].

15     At the time of the trial which commenced in August 2020, both the accused and the victim were still undergoing divorce proceedings to resolve issues of custody (of Z) and division of matrimonial assets. In the interim Syariah Court order dated 4 October 2020, the accused was given unsupervised access to Z from 12.00pm to 3.00pm every Sunday effective 4 October 2020 (“D5”). As of 25 November 2020, the accused was given unsupervised access to Z for three hours for the initial three months, and thereafter increased to six hours for another three months and subsequent overnight access.

## Prosecution’s case

16     The prosecution adduced evidence from the following five witnesses, namely: i) the victim (“PW1”); ii) Nur Syazuanie Atieqah Binte Hashari, the paramedic (“PW2”); iii) PW3; iv) Senior Investigation Officer, Muhammad Tarmizi Bin Osman (“PW4”); and v) ASP Lim En Teck Sherwin, Investigation Officer, who took over from PW4 after the latter was posted to another department in the first week of February 2019 (“PW5”).

### Incident on 15 December 2018

17     The victim testified that the accused had informed her at about 11am on 15 December 2018 that DW2 was going to pick them up around 12 noon. She took a shower and fed Z his milk, while the accused was in the master bedroom toilet getting ready. After feeding Z, the victim asked the accused to wash Z’s milk bottle, but he shouted back that he was getting ready. The victim also observed that he was getting ready very slowly. At the time, she was carrying Z with the intention of bringing him to the living room[^5]. The victim asked the accused a second time to wash the milk bottle, but the accused refused to do so and started scolding vulgarities, to which the victim told the accused to refrain from using vulgarities in front of Z as they had previously agreed that they would not use vulgarities in front of their child[^6].

18     By this time, the accused had come out of the master bedroom toilet and the victim was carrying their son, Z, while they were both in the master bedroom. The accused started scolding the victim again, as the victim had raised her voice[^7]. Thereafter, the accused swung his arm, using his right hand to slap the victim hard on the left side of her face, and in so doing, his hand also hit Z’s head as she was carrying him at the time. Z started crying ‘very badly’. She was shocked and shouted at the accused to not hit her. He continued to slap the victim on her face a second time, and in the course of doing so, the accused’s hand hit Z’s head[^8] a second time. He slapped the victim a third time, after which the victim moved away and pushed the accused on the chest, where the accused moved back. Thereafter, the victim carried Z who was still crying, to the living room where she sat on the L-shaped sofa (“sofa”) to console him[^9].

19     While the victim was seated on the sofa with Z (who was seated to her left), the accused asked her to pass him the child. She told him that she would do so after he calmed down. The victim raised her right hand when she said this as he was standing in front of her. Thereafter, the accused in his anger, responded by holding onto her right wrist, twisting her arm and pulled it behind her back[^10]. She told the accused to stop as it was very painful as she was leaning towards the left hugging her child. The accused then locked the victim’s knees by placing his knees round hers[^11] to prevent her from moving and leaned towards her. This was followed by ‘a very loud crack[^12]’ of the victim’s humerus bone which was broken. The accused released her hand and said that he did not have any intention of breaking it. Immediately, the victim felt numbness on her arm and felt that it was ‘a bit loose’. The victim was shocked and started crying and told the accused to call the ambulance, to which he did so and informed that he had broken his wife’s arm[^13]. The victim told the accused to carry their son as she was unable to console him at this point in time as he was crying. The accused carried Z and tried to pacify him. She told the accused that she could actually lodge a police report, to which the accused responded by saying that if she did, he will do something to Z[^14].

20     The paramedics, namely PW2, a medic and the driver, arrived subsequently. PW2 testified that the door of the unit was open, and the accused led her and her colleagues to the living room where the victim was seated on the sofa. The victim told them that the accused had twisted her arm and it broke. She did not inform them of the circumstances which led to the injury to her arm. PW2 was unable to recall if there was anyone else apart from the accused (who was carrying a baby) and the victim who were present in the unit when they arrived[^15].

21     PW2, who attended to her, testified that the victim informed her that she ‘was playing with her husband’ and that he had twisted her arm and placed her hand to the back[^16], to explain how her arm had been broken. PW2 examined the victim’s right arm and found a ‘swelling’ and ‘protrusion’ above the victim’s right elbow, indicating that there might be a fracture. She immobilised the victim’s arm, bandaged it and gave the victim medication, namely, an analgesic. PW2 was unable to recall if DW2 was present when they arrived. She testified that the victim and the accused who was carrying a baby, were present in the unit.

22     The victim was brought to the Accident and Emergency department (“A&E”) of Ng Teng Fong Hospital where she informed the A&E doctor (“the doctor”) who attended to her that the accused had twisted her arm to the back and that the accused had no intention to break it. She did not elaborate in detail as to the circumstances which led to the injury to her arm as the accused was in the room when she was speaking to the said doctor. However, the doctor did not appear to believe her version given that the humerus bone was broken, a huge amount of force had to be applied, to which he said that a police report had to be made[^17]. The victim declined to do so. The victim also requested to be transferred to SGH as it was closer to her parents’ place located at Blk 27 Telok Blangah Way where it would be more convenient for her parents to visit her in SGH.

23     PW3 testified that the victim was reviewed by the ‘on-call team’ on 15 December 2018, and he reviewed her on 16 December 2018. She complained of pain to her right arm and informed that the accused held and twisted her right arm behind her while ‘they were playing around’, resulting in the upper arm above the elbow or right humerus bone to be broken. PW3 testified that the victim sustained a comminuted facture where ‘a significant amount of force[^18]’ was required. He explained that there was ‘an element of twisting’ as seen from the ‘spiral configuration’ and the fracture was ‘comminuted’ which meant that it was broken into ‘a few small pieces’, where more force was required to generate such a fracture rather than a simple 2-part fracture[^19].

24     During one of the follow-up visits to PW3 on 24 January 2019 (two days after the police report was made on 22 January 2019), the victim told PW3 as to what exactly transpired during the incident as to how the accused actually twisted her arm (while she was seated) and how it actually broke and that he may have done so out of anger[^20]. PW3 confirmed that initially the victim felt her husband ‘was playing around’, but subsequently, from the way he treated her, ‘she felt that there was intention for him to hurt her’ and she had made a police report and was intending to file for a PPO[^21]. PW3 confirmed that the victim’s account that her arm was twisted behind her back was consistent with the injury that she sustained[^22].

25     Upon being cross-examined by defence on whether the injury sustained by the victim would be possible if the victim was holding onto a knife and the accused were to turn and twist her arm to the back of her body in an attempt to release her grip on the knife, PW3 said that it was possible. However, upon clarification by the prosecution, PW3 testified that while he did not have experience in disarming a person holding onto a knife, he clarified that the ‘mechanism of the injury based on the fracture is one of a twisting force’ and was consistent with the arm being twisted behind the back. As observed by PW3, if one were to try to disarm someone from holding a knife, it would be more probable for that person to twist the knife away from the victim rather than behind the back as the knife would be very close to the person holding the knife and to both parties.[^23]

### Reasons for failing to make a police report immediately or inform the paramedics and doctor what exactly happened after the incident

26     The victim did not inform the attending paramedics that the accused had twisted her arm and broken it during a quarrel at the outset. Neither did she lodge a police report or tell her family the truth immediately after the incident on 15 December 2018 for the following reasons:

> (i)     After the accused had broken her arm, the accused had told her that he did not intend to break it and the victim believed that he indeed may not have had such an intention[^24].

> (ii)     The victim testified that after the accused had broken her arm and while they were waiting for the paramedics, the accused threatened her that if she made a police report, ‘he will do something to Z’. At that point, the accused was standing near the window carrying Z, and she was afraid that he may do something dangerous. She further testified that even when she was being conveyed in the ambulance and alone with the paramedics, she did not inform them of the truth as she did not want the police to turn up at the hospital to arrest the accused given that Z was alone with the accused and she could not look after Z[^25]. She was thus concerned for her son’s safety[^26].

> (iii)     Believing that the accused had no intention to break her arm, the victim had decided that she still wanted to salvage her marriage at that point in time[^27].

27     Both PW4 and PW5 confirmed, upon cross-examination by the defence that no knife was seized from the matrimonial home during the course of investigations.

## Close of Prosecution’s case

28     The defence did not make any submissions at the close of the prosecution’s case. Further, I was also satisfied that there was some evidence which was not inherently incredible and accordingly, I called for the accused to give his defence. The accused elected to give evidence.

## Defence’s Case

29     The defence is one of denial of both charges, namely, that he did not slap the victim on her face three times which consequently hit Z’s head, the subject matter of the rash act charge. Whilst he did not deny causing the fracture to the victim’s arm, he had no intention to cause hurt to her when he twisted her right hand that was holding the knife to the back of her body, to release her grip on the knife the victim was holding at the material time as she had threatened to commit suicide.

30     According to the accused, both the accused and the victim were getting ready to go to the house-warming function as DW2 had confirmed the time that he was going to pick them up. At that point in time, the victim was preparing the milk for Z and where she told the accused to feed Z. He fed Z and told the victim to get ready first. The accused was feeding their son in the living room area while the victim was getting ready in the master bedroom. After feeding Z, the accused carried Z to the master bedroom and put him to sleep. As the accused was getting ready, the victim asked him where the milk bottle was that he used to feed Z, to which the accused replied that he had left it on the coffee table, in the living room. In response, the accused claimed that the victim ‘started showing face’ and asked him as to why he did not bring the milk bottle to the room to have it washed and put into Z’s diaper bag. The accused, in turn, told her that the bottle could be washed later and kept in the bag before they left the house[^28]. The victim started throwing tantrums as she was irritated with the accused over Z’s milk bottle not being washed. The victim left the master bedroom and slammed the door to take the bottle that was in the living room area. After she came back to the room with the bottle, the accused claimed that they continued arguing over the ‘baby bottle matter’.

31     The argument escalated where the accused claimed that the victim shouted that she would not be going to the house-warming function anymore. He tried to console her and told her that it was ‘not worth fighting for this matter’. He also told the victim that he would go to the function with Z and that she could stay at home, to ‘relax’. All of a sudden, the victim started saying that she would commit suicide if he brought Z to the function without her, before running from the master bedroom to the kitchen to grab a knife from the kitchen drawer[^29].

32     The accused claimed that the victim had a history of attempting suicide and alleged that there were deep cuts on the victim’s ankles and wrists[^30]. He had noticed these cuts after their marriage. According to the accused, he claimed that she had previously told him that she would cut herself when she was stressed due to a previous relationship[^31]. He also alleged that she was suffering from post-natal depression at the material time.

33     Afraid that she would harm herself, the accused followed her to the kitchen and hugged her from behind thereby wrapping his arms around her to restrain her arms, which were at the side of her body and parallel to her legs. He did this in order to prevent her from swinging the knife[^32]. While the victim was struggling throughout and holding the knife in her right hand, the accused ‘dragged’ her in backward motion[^33] from the kitchen to the living room area while he was positioned behind her and still restraining her by wrapping his arms around her[^34].

34     The accused then turned the victim’s body 180 degrees such that she was now facing the window in the living room (see Exhibit “A” for the plan of the matrimonial home) and thereafter sat the victim down on the sofa while he was still wrapping his arms around her from behind[^35]. It was only after he sat her down that he took her right arm and twisted it to the side of her body to get her to drop the knife[^36]. In doing so, the knife fell to the ground and the victim cried in pain as her arm had broken.

35     Whilst waiting for the paramedics, the accused claimed that the victim told him that no one should know about her suicidal attempts and that she had taken a knife in an attempt to harm herself as this would jeopardise her career in the civil service, given that she was working in the Criminal Investigation Department (“CID”) of the Singapore Police Force.

36     The accused further claimed that the victim had asked him to inform the paramedics or anyone else (who may ask about the victim’s injury) that they were ‘playing’ and that he had accidentally twisted her arm[^37]. After the incident, the accused placed the knife which had fell onto the floor and placed it back in the kitchen drawer. He then attended to Z who was crying in the master bedroom. He also testified that DW2 had arrived at the unit prior to the paramedics. The accused claimed that he had informed DW2 about how he ended up breaking the victim’s arm, namely, that he had an argument with the victim when they were getting ready, and that the victim wanted to commit suicide. She had then taken a knife, which the accused had to remove from her hand by twisting her arm which resulted in the injury sustained by the victim[^38].

37     The defence called two other witnesses, namely, DW2 and the friend of the couple, Vijayachandran s/o Chandrasegaran (“DW3”).

38     DW2 testified that on 15 December 2018 that while he was on his way to fetch the accused and the victim from their matrimonial home to go to another brother’s housewarming function, which was located at Bukit Panjang, he received a call from the accused, who informed him that he had accidentally broken the victim’s hand. He arrived at the accused’s house between 1-2pm and the ambulance had also arrived at the same time. He used the staircase to reach the unit on the fourth floor as he claimed it was quicker than taking the lift.

39     When DW2 entered the house, he noticed the victim was seated on the sofa crying and using her left hand to support her right arm. The accused met him in the living room and handed Z over to him (namely, DW2), who asked him what happened. The accused told him that the victim took a knife and in his attempt to take the knife away from the victim, he twisted her hand and her arm broke[^39]. The accused proceeded to console the victim. DW2 heard the victim saying to the accused to not mention anything about the knife and that they were playing around[^40]. According to DW2, two paramedics arrived at the unit about two to three minutes after he arrived at the unit.

40     DW3 testified that the accused and Z stayed in his house overnight for the first one or two days for the period from 16-27 December 2018 (when the victim was hospitalised). According to DW3, he was not privy to the agreement that the accused and victim had for the accused and Z to stay in DW3’s place during the period of the victim’s hospitalisation.

## Findings

41     This was a case of differing accounts. The defence was a bare denial in so far as the accused denied slapping the victim on her face three times and consequently hitting Z’s head, which act was committed rashly as to endanger the personal safety of Z. I did not hold this against the accused. As the High Court stated in _Teo Keng Pong v PP_ \[1996\] 3 SLR 329, “… a bare denial does not carry the connotation that it cannot be true”.

42     As for the voluntarily causing hurt charge, the accused did not deny that he had fractured the victim’s arm by twisting it but denied having the intention to cause hurt to the victim when he twisted her right arm to the back of her body as he had intended to release the grip on the knife she was holding in her right hand when she threatened to harm herself.

43     It was undisputed that the victim had sustained a comminuted right distal humerus fracture. In this regard, my main task is to evaluate the evidence with care to determine which of the two versions, namely, the victim’s or the accused’s evidence was more credible.

### Victim’s credibility

44     As the prosecution’s case rests solely on the evidence of the victim, it had to be “unusually convincing”. In _PP v GCK_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] 1 SLR 486</span> (“_PP v GCK_”), the Court of Appeal held at \[104\] that the “the unusually convincing” standard applies to the uncorroborated evidence of a witness in all offences and not just sexual offences, where such evidence forms the sole basis for a conviction. In principle, the standard applies regardless of whether the witness is an eyewitness or an alleged victim.

45     In _PP v GCK_, the Court of Appeal explained further on what “unusually convincing” meant at \[88\], \[90\] to \[92\]:

> The “unusually convincing” standard is used to describe a situation where the witness’s testimony is “**so convincing that the Prosecution’s case \[is\] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the evidence**”: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[38\]. In _Haliffie bin Mamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 5 SLR 636</span> at \[28\], this court considered that “**a complainant’s testimony would be unusually convincing if the testimony, ‘when weighed against the overall backdrop of the available facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth which leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists in favour of the accused**.” (citing _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\]).

> ….

> Put simply, the “unusually convincing” standard **entails that the witness’s testimony** **_alone_** **is sufficient to prove the Prosecution’s case beyond a reasonable doubt**: See _Teo Keng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[73\]. The overwhelming consideration that triggers the application of the standard is the amount and availability of evidence: see also _Kwan Peng Pong v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1996\] 2 SLR(R) 890</span> at \[29\].

> ……

> In a sense, the “unusually convincing” standard is not a “test” at all, but rather a _heuristic_ tool. It is a cautionary reminder to the court of **the high threshold that the Prosecution must meet in order to secure a conviction, and of the anxious scrutiny that is required because of the severe consequences that will follow from a conviction.** That scrutiny is directed towards the sufficiency of a witness’s testimony, which is inextricably linked to the ultimate inquiry of whether the case against the accused persons has been proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt: see _Mohammed Liton_ at \[39\].

> ….

> Rather, its aim is to ensure that the trial judge has an awareness of the dangers of convicting the accused person on uncorroborated evidence, and that he or she (as well as the appellate court) undertakes a rigorous and _holistic_ assessment of the evidence.

#### Events leading to the accused slapping the victim and hitting Z

46     Having assessed the victim’s evidence as a whole, I found the victim to be a truthful witness who gave compelling evidence. Against the backdrop of the circumstances which led to the commission of the offences on 15 December 2018, it was undisputed that the accused and the victim had an argument over the washing of their son’s milk bottle which the victim insisted that the accused do the same, resulting in the accused uttering vulgarities and raising his voice, in the course of their argument. In turn, the accused claimed that the victim was getting frustrated and angry and was in fact ‘throwing tantrums’. It would appear that parties were clearly having a heated argument prior to the events which unfolded and where their respective versions differ thereafter, namely whether the victim was carrying Z at the time prior to the accused slapping the victim on her face or whether Z was sleeping in the master bedroom as alleged by the accused.

47     As both parties were getting ready to be picked up by DW2 to go for the house-warming function, I found it difficult to believe that Z would have been put down on the bed to sleep at the time when by both accounts, he was meant to go with the accused and the victim to the said function. It therefore did not make sense that Z would have to be woken up abruptly to leave for the house-warming function when DW2 came to pick them up. Additionally, it was undisputed that there was not much time to get themselves and Z ready (which included packing Z’s diaper bag as well), as they had about an hour[^41] before DW2 came to pick them up. Further, the victim was not cross-examined on this aspect either or the defence’s case put to the victim that Z was sleeping on the bed. In the case of _Yeo Kwan Wee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] 2 SLR(R) 45</span>, it was observed by Yong Pung How CJ at \[35\]:

> ....As I noted in _Liza bte Ismail v PP_ \[1997\] 1 SLR (R) 555, the central purpose of the rule in _Browne v Dunn_ is simply to secure procedural fairness in litigation. The rule ensures that contradictory facts are put to the witness during cross-examination to give the witness an opportunity to respond. Any testimony left unchallenged may be treated by the court as undisputed and therefore accepted by the opposing part: _Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 2 SLR(R) 936</span>.

48     Given the heated argument that transpired between parties over the washing of Z’s milk bottle, as well as the accused using vulgarities to scold the victim, in Z’s presence (which was undisputed), I found the victim’s version of events that followed thereafter to be more credible. Despite robust cross-examination by defence counsel, she did not waver on material aspects of her evidence where she had consistently maintained that the accused had slapped her three times on the left side of her face while she was carrying Z on the right side of her body, where the top of his head was near to her chin. Whilst the victim had agreed with defence counsel’s question that the child’s head was close to her shoulder and upper body, I did not think there was any inconsistency where the victim explained that Z was leaning on her shoulder, in which case Z’s head would be naturally close to her chin as well as her upper body and shoulder.

49     As explained by the victim, she was getting irritated by the accused not wanting to wash Z’s milk bottle and had raised her voice when she had the argument with him. As the accused had described the victim as ‘throwing tantrums’ at this time, it would not have been inconceivable for the accused to also have been somewhat irritated with the victim. According to the victim, this was what led the accused to slap her as she had raised her voice at him, and in the course of doing so, the accused’s hand had hit the right side of Z’s head[^42] as well as she was carrying Z at the time. This was followed by Z crying. The victim had asked the accused to stop slapping her as it had hit Z’s head and she shouted at him. The accused, however, slapped the victim on her face for a second and third time. In the process, the accused had hit Z again on the second slap.

50     As noted in \[18\] above, the accused slapped the victim a third time, after which the victim moved away and pushed the accused on the chest, where the accused moved back. Thereafter, the victim carried Z who was still crying, to the living room where she sat on the sofa to console him[^43].

51     Given the position as described by the victim that Z’s head was close to her chin as well, Z would have been in a position such that when the accused had slapped the left side of the victim’s face with his right hand, he would have hit Z’s head if his hand had followed-through given that Z’s head was next to the victim’s face. The victim had been consistent on this aspect and I saw no reason to doubt her version of events.

52     Not unexpectedly, the victim had brought Z to the living room as he was crying and the events that unfolded as narrated by the victim at \[19\] above was consistent with PW3’s evidence that a substantial amount of force would have been used, resulting in the injury sustained by the victim as stated in \[7\] above. The entire sequence of events as accounted by the victim was clearly a series of events which escalated from a quarrel over Z’s milk bottle, explaining why the accused had slapped her while she was carrying Z and culminating to the point where the accused had twisted the victim’s arm when she raised her right arm and broke it as she did not want to pass Z over to him until he cooled down.

#### Plausible reasons for failing to make a police report immediately following the incident and informing the paramedic (PW2), doctor (PW3) and her family members of the circumstances leading to the incident

53     The victim did not inform PW2 and PW3 that the accused had twisted her arm and broken it during a quarrel at the outset. Neither did she inform her family members of the same. I found her explanation to be plausible at \[26\] above. After all, the accused and victim were married for about two years and they had a young child at the material time, it would therefore have been reasonable for the victim to want to salvage her marriage at that point in time.

54     Whilst the accused had claimed that he had said to the victim that he did not have the intention to break her arm immediately following the incident, the victim’s testimony was consistent with contemporaneous Whatsapp messages she exchanged with the accused shortly after the incident on 15 December 2018 while she was in the hospital.

55     An extract from the Whatsapp chatlog between the victim and the accused (“P5”) is reproduced below for ease of reference:

56     From the above chatlogs, where the victim stated that the accused had ‘broken’ her hand so that she could not take care of Z, as well as the tenor of the victim’s testimony that the accused had twisted her arm during the quarrel out of anger, in response to the victim refusing to hand over Z to the accused (when the victim and Z were both seated on the sofa in the living room), it was clear that the victim had entertained the possibility that the accused had broken her arm intentionally so that she would not be able to take care of Z in future. That said, the other two reasons, namely, that she was concerned for Z’s safety, that the accused had threatened to do something to him should she lodge a police report and salvaging her marriage at the time, were sufficiently compelling and believable for her to refrain from lodging a police report soon after the incident. More pertinently, the victim was also unsure of the chain of events that would be set in motion, in particular, as to what would happen to Z (namely, as to who would take care of him), if the police were waiting to arrest the accused at the hospital, had she lodged a police report.

57     The defence had submitted that the victim had lied in court when she stated in her evidence that the accused was present when she saw PW3[^45] and therefore could not tell the doctor the truth. As highlighted by the prosecution in its reply submissions at \[14\] that the victim’s evidence on this point in fact arose during cross-examination when she was asked about whether the accused had been with her on 15 December 2018 at the A&E of SGH. The victim’s evidence in response was that the accused had been present during her consultation with the doctor at SGH on 15 December 2018. However, she stated that there was a point in time as well when the accused was not present during the consultation with the doctor, and elaborated that, if she was not wrong, it was when the doctor gave her pain killers[^46].

58     It was clear that the victim had not lied when she stated that the accused had been with her on 15 December 2018 at the A&E in SGH. PW3’s evidence was that the victim was alone when he first reviewed her on 16 December 2018[^47] and not 15 December 2018. She was in fact seen by an on-call team on 15 December 2018[^48]. The issue of any alleged inconsistency between the victim’s evidence and PW3’s evidence was hence limited to whether PW3 had reviewed the victim on 15 December 2018 or 16 December 2018, and not whether the accused was present with the victim at the A&E in SGH on 15 December 2018. In this regard, when the victim was questioned by defence counsel on whether PW3 was the doctor she had seen on 15 December 2018, the victim stated that there were many doctors at A&E and PW3 was one of them[^49]. Whilst the victim’s recollection of which doctor, she had seen at the A&E in SGH on 15 December 2018 was not clear as she had the impression that she had seen PW3 then, the fact remained that the accused was present when she had first attended at the A&E in SGH.

59     In any event, the victim had candidly admitted during cross-examination that she had been alone with PW3 when he first examined her and could have told him the truth as to how she sustained her injury at that point in time[^50]. She had also offered plausible explanations as noted at \[26\] above as to why she did not want to disclose the truth at the material time and in that regard, I find no reason for the victim to lie in court about this aspect of her evidence as raised by the defence.

#### Reasons for making the police report on 22 January 2019

60     It was further alleged by the defence that the victim had made the police report in order to strengthen her case for ongoing divorce proceedings, in particular, to advance her case to obtain sole custody, care and control of Z. The issue then was whether the victim would fabricate her evidence in relation to the incident which would give her an advantage in relation to the divorce proceedings.

61     Whilst the police report was made by the victim on 22 January 2019, about a month after the incident, I found the victim’s reasons for doing so to be credible, which had to be viewed against the backdrop of the relationship between the accused and the victim (who were still married at the time) as well as their respective families. It would not be an understatement to suggest that such familial relationships are complex to say the least, especially when the in-laws are involved. However, parties were restrained in ensuring that the evidence adduced during this trial were focused on the criminal charges, without going into too much detail of the couple’s relationship and its eventual breakdown where it was undisputed that the victim had filed for divorce on 2 February 2019. According to the victim, it was precipitated by the incident that occurred between the accused, his father and DW2 and the victim’s father as highlighted in \[14\] above.

62     According to the victim, she stated that she had a ‘bitter kind of relationship’[^51] with the accused’s parents, which was undisputed by the defence. The victim testified that it was her in-laws’ unhappiness over her always keeping a watchful eye on Z when they were with him or not allowing them to play with Z[^52]. In a phone conversation which the accused had with the victim on 22 January 2019 at about 3.08pm[^53], just prior to her making the police report (namely, P1, an e-report made at 4.16pm), the victim testified that they had an argument in the course of this conversation regarding how Z was treated by their respective families. One of the allegations involved Z being fed by the accused’s uncle some sweets (‘kesari’) when Z was three months old, where the victim was concerned that he would get choked. Whilst the accused denied that his uncle had done so, the victim further claimed that the accused did not want her to continue staying at her parents’ place with Z as he was afraid that Z would grow closer to her parents. In the course of their heated argument, the victim raised her voice, and the accused uttered vulgarities followed by the accused saying, ‘that is why my parents asked me to break your hand[^54]’.

63     The accused claimed that the phone call from the victim on 22 January 2019 at about 3.08pm was unlikely, although not impossible as he was working[^55]. Whilst the accused had denied the allegations of his parents asking him to break the victim’s hand or that he had uttered these words to the victim in the course of their argument during this tele-conversation, it was undisputed that just prior to the victim lodging the police report, they both had an argument about the victim’s father smoking in the presence of Z. According to the victim, this was in response to what she observed the night before, on 21 January 2019, when the accused came over to her parents’ place to pick Z up at about 5-6pm and sent him to his parents’ place, after which the accused dropped Z back at the victim’s parents’ place at about 9.00pm[^56]. The victim observed that the accused’s face had ‘changed’ when he dropped Z back at the victim’s parents place and the victim expected another argument between the accused and herself the next day, namely, 22 January 2019[^57].

64     Whilst the victim had alluded that the tele-conversation between her and accused was ‘a long fight... with many issues’, she also provided the context of her relationship between her and the accused where she alleged that there were instances where the accused was not concerned about their child and had even asked her to abort their child when she was first pregnant[^58]. The culmination of those words which the accused had said that his parents had asked him to break her hand, shocked the victim. She hung up the phone and that was when it dawned upon her that it was ‘no longer unintentional’. She was concerned that if she believed whatever the accused had said that he did not have any intention at the material time, he could do anything to her in future[^59]. From the tenor of her evidence, it was clear that she was fearful as to what the accused could do to her in the future, which led her to make the police report.

65     From the victim’s perspective, it was therefore reasonable for her to disbelieve the accused’s previous assertion that he did not break her arm intentionally, after he made the remark that his parents had asked him to break her hand, in the course of their argument, prior to lodging the police report. It was also against the backdrop that the parties had disagreements regarding each other’s respective parents as well as other issues during their marriage, that the victim changed her mind to make a police report on the same day. Most tellingly is the fact that the victim had maintained that the purpose of lodging the police report was to apply for a PPO against the accused and his family, which would be consistent with what the accused had said to her regarding his parents asking him to break her hand. Even if the accused’s parents had not asked the accused to do so, the fact remained that it was said by the accused in the context of their argument, which led the victim to disbelieve the accused’s assertion that he did not intend to break her arm.

66     The fact that the victim had lodged a police report on 19 January 2019 and subsequently filed for divorce on 2 February 2019, cannot be sufficient grounds to support the defence’s assertion that the victim had a motive to falsely implicate the accused in order to strengthen her divorce proceedings. There has been no evidence adduced by the defence of this motive before me, save for a bare assertion, which the High Court had clearly held that the defence bears the burden to adduce sufficient evidence of this motive, so as to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case (see _Goh Han Heng v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2003\] 4 SLR(R) 374</span> (“_Goh Han Heng_”) at \[33\]).

#### Victim’s evidence regarding allegations of attempted suicide

67     The victim had candidly admitted that she had cut marks on her left wrist which were visible if a closer a look was taken as they were now faded[^60]. She had testified that they were inflicted when she was in secondary school where a pen knife was used to create scratch marks[^61] and that it was a ‘trend’ then with her friends in an all-girl secondary school. She further testified that there were no suicidal thoughts involved when she inflicted the cuts[^62] then. She also confirmed that those were the only cuts on her body.

68     Whilst it was alleged by the defence that the accused had post-natal depression which was denied, there was no evidence adduced by the defence either that the victim was suffering from post-natal depression or that she had attempted to commit suicide during the course of their marriage, I therefore found the victim’s evidence to be credible in this aspect that whilst the victim had admitted to making cut marks as a result of a school-girl fad, there was clearly no evidence before me that suggest that the victim was suicidal at the material time.

69     Further, I found it hard to believe that the victim would have wanted to attempt suicide in those circumstances as described by the accused, which arose from a suggestion by the accused that he went to the house-warming function with Z only and that she remained at home, that she would be so disproportionately upset as a result. From the Whatsapp messages between parties, following the incident on 15 December 2018 as seen in \[55\] above, the victim was always concerned for Z’s safety and who would be taking care of him. The victim did not come across as someone who would have been overly upset by the accused’s suggestion (even if it were true) that he went to the house-warming function without her to the extent of taking her own life, where for obvious reasons, she would not have been able to take care of Z if she succeeded.

#### Victim’s explanation as to why she did not send Z for medical treatment on 15 December 2018

70     The defence had attempted to undermine the credibility of the victim’s account on Z having been hit by the accused on 15 December 2018, by pointing out that she had not sought medical treatment for Z at the time after the incident on 15 December 2018. She explained that she was in pain and had just been conveyed to the hospital and it would not have been easy for her to inform her family, who was taking care of Z at that point, to bring him to the doctor without telling them the truth about what happened on 15 December 2018[^63].

71     While the victim had admitted during cross-examination by defence counsel, that she could have fabricated a story and lied to her family to form a pretext to ask them to bring Z to a doctor, I found her explanation to be credible and wholly reasonable that she did not do so, especially since she was already pre-occupied with her own pain and injury. After all, she had decided to not inform anyone of the circumstances which led to her injury, and there was no indication at the time that Z had sustained any injury or was unwell. The victim also pointed out that her family did not alert her of any issues, and she found that there was no necessity to send him for medical treatment[^64].

72     The defence had submitted that the victim had taken ‘long pauses’ in responding to questions relating to the above, I did not think that it could be construed against her credibility as a witness. Having observed her in court when she testified, I was not persuaded that these purported ‘long pauses’ suggest that she was not a witness of truth. Given the nature of the questions asked by the defence which pertained to her reasons for not sending Z for medical treatment at the material time and having to recall events that took place almost two years prior to her testifying in court, it would have been understandable for her to take some time to recall. In any event these purported ‘long pauses’ ranged from five to 13 seconds[^65], which in my view, were not inordinately long but pauses taken by witnesses to recall events that took place sometime ago. In that regard, I did not think that there was any reason to discount her evidence on the basis of these pauses.

### Accused’s credibility

73     It was clear from the evidence of both parties that a heated verbal argument took place prior to the alleged incidents, over the washing of Z’s milk bottle. Even by the accused’s own account, it was just a ‘small matter’. However, it was the defence’s case that the victim had reacted by threatening to commit suicide at the accused’s suggestion that he brought Z to the function without her, so that she could relax at home. I found the accused’s evidence on this aspect to be inherently incredible for the following reasons:

> (i)     First, that the victim would react so disproportionately over a fairly trivial domestic matter as to threaten to commit suicide especially in the absence of any evidence to support the accused’s bare assertion that the victim suffered from post-natal depression or that she was suicidal prior to the incidents in relation to both charges. In fact, the accused had testified that he was not aware of any suicidal attempts by the victim in the course of their marriage prior to the material time[^66]. Whilst it was admitted by the victim that the cut marks which she had inflicted on her wrists were sometime ago when she was in secondary school, she had also explained that it was a trend then amongst her secondary school friends and that she did not do so with suicidal ideations.

> (ii)     Second, the accused’s narrative that he had twisted the victim’s arm in a bid to disarm her as summarised in \[33\] and \[34\] was illogical, especially where he had to drag the victim from the kitchen to the living room and then turn her 180 degrees before getting her to sit on the sofa, before twisting her arm and disarming the knife from her hand when she was struggling the whole time. The accused was evasive and unable to give a logical explanation when he was cross-examined by the prosecution as to why he would have to turn the victim 180 degrees first before disarming her, save that he just wanted to ‘snatch away the knife that she was holding’[^67]. I agree with the prosecution’s submission that if the accused was truly pre-occupied with disarming her as he claimed, the course of action to be taken would be to disarm the victim at the outset in the kitchen when she first grabbed the knife, rather than taking ‘a host of completely redundant actions as aforesaid[^68]’. Suffice to say, the fact that there was a purported 180 degree turn which the accused had to make to get the victim to be seated on the sofa, it would appear that this would also put the victim at the very same spot on the sofa where the victim had testified that the accused had twisted her arm and broke it.

> (iii)     Third, the accused’s account that he had managed to sit the victim down on the sofa while continuing to wrap his arms around her from behind to restrain her also did not make sense and bereft of any credibility. When asked to explain as to how he could have done this, he was unable to recall if he was seated with the victim, followed by him standing up[^69] or if she was the only one who sat down[^70]. Neither was he able to give a coherent explanation as to how he managed to seat the victim on the sofa but fell back on his evidence that he was pre-occupied in trying to take away the knife when she was in a seated position[^71]. The relevant extracts of the accused’s evidence are below:

>   
| 

Q:

 | 

So, Mr Saalai, firstly, given the manner that you were holding on to the victim and the fact that she was struggling, it is not logical that you would be able to place her down in a sitting position with you standing behind her, correct?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Uh, Si..Sir, likewise, I told you, the thing happened too fast, and my only intention was to, um,, s—uh, take the knife away from her hand, so as to she will not either harm herself or harm me. So if you want me to explain every single step. I think it will be a bit, um---[^72]

 |
| 

…..

 |
| 

……

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Yah. So you’re going to take us through. I mean that’s where the DPP is coming from, as to--- although it’s very fast, but its just to try to understand from that standing motion wrapping her around, ho-how you get her to sit – to be seated, right, on the sofa. So you just say that you can’t remember, which part? Whether you were[^73]

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Uh,---

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Seated, is it?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

whether did I sit down with her and then I stand up again, or, uh, whether is she the only person who s---who sat down.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Okay. But it’s--- what your evidence is --- so far is that you got her to sit down from that standing position, you were wrapping her --- arms around her from the behind and you managed to get her on the sofa---[^74]

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, Your Honour.

 |
| 

Court:

 | 

Seated?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Ye—yes. Your Honour. Because when I was uh, trying to take away the knife from her, she was in a seated position.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So you s---you are saying that you must have ---you were holding her from behind throughout, right?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Yes, Sir.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And so you must have sat down while holding her still, to restrain her while she was struggling, correct?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Um, I—I could have and then I would have stood up again.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And you stood up again, while still being able to restrain her from behind. Is that what you’re saying?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Um, I don’t get you, Sir.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

So you s—just said that your were --- you must have been retraining her from behind---

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Mmm hmm.

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

And then you sat – you—but you stood up again?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Uh, you mean while I was still holding her, is it?

 |
| 

Q:

 | 

Yes. So when you stood up again were you still holding onto her?

 |
| 

A:

 | 

Uh, no. I wa—I wasn’t. I – I think, uh, at that point in time, uh, if I were to be standing at that point of time, I would have, um, holding onto her, um, arm—hand[^75].

 |

  
  

> (iv)     Fourth, the accused’s version of events is that he had twisted her hand which was holding the knife _towards_ her body in order to disarm her, was also lacking in credibility. According to the accused, the victim was struggling such that he had to restrain her with a force of 8 or 9 out of 10[^76], which would have been substantial. Further, his evidence was that he had twisted her right hand, which was holding the knife, inwards towards her body[^77] to disarm her, which did not make sense as there would be an obvious risk that she would be harmed by the knife, especially if his intention was to protect her from harming herself in the first place. As observed by PW3 in \[25\] above, it would have been more probable for the person who was trying to disarm the victim to twist the knife away from the victim.

> (v)     Fifth, it is pertinent to note that the victim’s evidence was that the accused had broken her arm while she was seated close to the corner of the “L-shaped” sofa in the living room, which the prosecution at \[56\] of its closing submissions, had aptly summarised that ‘the accused had taken and maintained the above problematic positions in evidence even though they do not cohere with common sense and logic is because he had indeed broken the victim’s am’ while she was seated at the sofa, by twisting her arm towards her body.

> (vi)     Sixth, according to the accused, the incident in question was the first time that the victim had threatened suicide during their relationship. This would ‘by no means have been a regular or normal event for the accused[^78]’, yet there was nothing raised or alluded to by the accused with reference to the victim threatening suicide in the chatlogs of the Whatsapp messages between the parties (namely, P5 and D4 respectively), to vindicate himself or at least defend himself in response to the direct allegations levelled against the accused that he had intentionally broken her arm with a malicious motive. The extract in P5 is at \[55\] above and the relevant extract from D4 is reproduced below for ease of reference:

> If the accused’s version of events were to be believed that he had merely twisted the victim’s arm to disarm a knife in order to protect her, it was curious that he apologised to her after asserting that he had broken her arm unintentionally. I agreed with the prosecution’s submissions at \[63\] that ‘there would have been no need to attempt to convince the victim that he did not intentionally break her arm, given that it would be plain that he was twisting her arm to get her to drop the knife’. When the accused was cross-examined on this aspect, he agreed with the DPP that it was unusual that he did not defend or attempt to defend himself in response to the victim’s allegations of intentionally breaking her arm (in the Whatsapp messages as above) when he had good intentions to protect her. He claimed that he did not want to aggravate the situation as the victim was in pain and that he did not want her to reply so that she could rest as she was texting with one hand. I found the accused’s explanation to be contrived to say the least, that his failure to provide an explanation to the victim’s allegations was conspicuously absent and would have provided some comfort since he had purported good and noble intentions when he twisted her arm to disarm her.

> (vii)     Seventh, the accused subsequently claimed during cross-examination that he talked to the victim subsequently about the incident of her threatening suicide when they had dinner at Pastamania in Vivocity (on 18 January 2019). When asked if he had spoken to the victim about the incident during text messages, he stated that it was all done via verbal communication, in which case there would have been no record to support his claim. Yet the victim was never cross-examined on this specific aspect that the parties had talked about the incident on 15 December 2018, in particular, of the victim’s attempted suicide but only about their ‘future plans’. I found the accused’s claim that he had spoken to the victim about her threatening suicide after the incident as clearly an afterthought which was fabricated to bolster his defence.

> (viii)    Eighth, in relation to P5 (reproduced above at \[55\]), the accused claimed that during the exchange of Whatsapp messages between him and the victim on 15 December 2018, when he stated that ‘it was really unintentional’, he meant to say that he did not mean to cause the victim any harm or pain. In re-examination, he had testified that he meant that he had no intention of ‘breaking your arm or causing hurt or causing pain to you[^80]’. On a perusal of P5, the victim had alleged that the accused had intentionally broken her arm. It was in this context that the accused had responded that it was “really unintentional”. In the course of the exchange between parties in P5, there was no reference of the causing of hurt or pain. In this regard, I found the accused’s evidence on this aspect to be clearly yet another afterthought to bolster his defence, given that he has now been charged for voluntarily causing hurt to the victim as opposed to voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the victim.

### DW2’s credibility

74     According to the accused, he had a close relationship with DW2 as they grew up with each other and DW2 was his older brother. The accused testified that he called DW2 on the phone sometime after the accused had twisted and broken the victim’s arm. His evidence was that he merely told DW2 ‘to come faster to his house’ as there was a problem with him and his wife and thereafter he hung up the phone[^81]. On the other hand, DW2 testified that during the conversation with the accused on the phone, the accused had told him specifically in Tamil “Brother, please hurry, I think I accidentally broke Zahira’s arm.” When confronted with this inconsistency during cross-examination, DW2 maintained his evidence, citing that he would have asked the accused for an explanation if the accused had just said that there was a problem.

75     Apart from the stark contrast between the accused’s and DW2’s evidence on this aspect, what is pertinent to note was the conversation that the accused purportedly had with DW2 when the latter arrived at the unit, where DW2 testified that the accused had informed him about how he (i.e. the accused) ended up breaking the victim’s arm by disarming her as she was holding a knife. Given that this was highly material to the accused’s defence, yet the victim was however, never cross-examined on this aspect, I was of the view that DW2’s evidence had to be regarded with some element of circumspection.

76     It was further undisputed by the defence that DW2 was present during the scuffle on 2 February 2019 which involved the accused, his father and the victim’s father. According to the victim, DW2 was about to hit her father which was captured by the victim’s sister on video as per \[14\] above. Given these facts, which were not challenged by the defence, DW2 could not be said to be an independent witness for the defence and in this regard, I gave little weight to his evidence in so far, that it purports to corroborate the accused’s evidence that he had told DW2 as to how he broke the victim’s arm.

### DW3’s evidence

77     DW3’s evidence pertained only to the issue of whether there was an agreement for the accused to stay at DW3’s residence from 16-27 December 2018, while the victim was hospitalised. The victim testified that she had made this agreement with the accused as the accused would otherwise have been unable to look after their son alone. This was however denied by the defence where there was no such agreement and the accused had only stayed overnight at DW3’s place for one or two days during the period from 16-27 December 2018.

78     DW3 claimed that the accused did not actually stay at his place for the period from 16-27 December 2018. He had also gone further to say that the victim was aware of this. DW3 acknowledged that he would not be privy to whether there was such an agreement between the accused and the victim[^82].

79     As pointed by the prosecution in their closing submissions at \[77\], the scope of DW3’s evidence was very narrow and did not shed light on the incident that took place on 15 December 2018. The victim’s evidence on this point that she made an agreement with the accused for him and Z to stay at DW3’s place must be understood in context. She was asked by the prosecution why she agreed to allow the accused to take care of Z after 15 December 2018 when he had broken her hand and threatened to harm Z. She explained that this was an agreement that they came to as at that time, she did not want to let any of her family members to know the truth of the events that occurred on 15 December 2018. In any event, the threat of harm would befall Z only if she lodged a police report (which she did not do so during the aforesaid period from 16 December to 27 December 2018). Even if the accused and Z had only stayed for one or two days in DW3’s place or not at all, I did not think that the victim’s credibility had been undermined for reasons as stated above, in so far as her evidence was concerned in relation to the material aspects of what occurred on 15 December 2018 pertaining to the two charges.

## Conclusion

80     Whilst it was not disputed that there was ‘some degree of normalcy’ in the martial relationship between the victim and the accused after 15 December 2018 (prior to lodging of the police report on 22 January 2019), where they had gone for dinner at Vivocity on 18 January 2019, the victim had testified that they also had their fair share of arguments ‘almost every time[^83]’. It would not have been inconceivable given that the victim had intended to salvage her marriage, which was one of the reasons for her not lodging the police report immediately after the incident.

81     As noted in the Whatspp messages between parties on 22 January 2019 (D4), more than one month later after the incident, it was ‘clear that their relationship continued to be plagued by the incident[^84]’. In both P5 and D4, the victim had made allegations against the accused for intentionally breaking her hand with malicious motives. This has also been consistent with the victim’s evidence in court. More importantly is the fact that the victim’s injury to her arm was consistent with her account of events which was corroborated by medical evidence. For the reasons as highlighted above, I found the victim to be unusually convincing and a witness of truth, where the acts committed by the accused were motivated by anger precipitated by the argument that parties had on the day in question.

82     On the other hand, I found the accused’s evidence to be internally and externally inconsistent, especially where the accused did not dispute the mechanism as to how the victim had sustained the fracture to her arm, namely that her arm was twisted to her back with substantial force. His main contention was that he had done so to disarm her. His bare assertions of an attempted suicide by the victim at the material time as well as the victim suffering from post-natal depression, rang hollow, as he attempted to use the fact that the victim had past cuts on her wrists (inflicted a long time ago when she was in secondary school[^85]), which were clearly calculated to bolster his defence, when there was no evidence that she had any past attempted suicides during their marriage.

83     Given that the evidence of what the accused informed the IO (PW4) during the course of investigations after he was called to the police station to give his statement, following the victim’s police report on 22 January 2019, is inadmissible[^86], I did not think that what he told PW4 regarding his version of events should therefore be in the court’s consideration.

84     Having accepted the victim’s evidence, I found the accused’s act of slapping the victim, while she was carrying Z, a five-month old baby at the time, clearly endangered the personal safety of Z. The accused had in fact hit Z two out of the three times as Z’s head was right next to the victim’s chin when the accused had slapped the victim. Even after it was highlighted by the victim after the first slap that his hand had hit Z’s head, the accused’s act of slapping the victim three times repeatedly while the victim was carrying Z was clearly rash. Such acts would have clearly posed a danger to Z’s personal safety due to the pain or impact from being slapped. In fact, Z was ‘crying badly’ as a result of what happened.

85     As for the voluntarily causing hurt charge, it was clear from the victim’s account that the accused had intended to cause hurt to the victim when he slapped her face three times and twisted her right arm. Both these acts had occurred in the context of the accused quarrelling with the victim. The accused had slapped the victim when she raised her voice at him. The accused had also twisted her arm during the quarrel, after the victim refused to hand Z over to him as he had instructed. As noted in \[81\] above, these acts were clearly motivated by anger, and it would not be unreasonable to infer that the accused must have intended to cause the victim pain when he committed these acts.

86     Thus, having considered the submissions from the prosecution and defence, as well as assessing the evidence in totality, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I found the accused guilty and convicted on both charges.

## Antecedents

87     The accused had no previous convictions for violence related offences. His previous antecedents relating to road traffic offences.

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

#### For the voluntarily causing hurt charge

88     The prosecution submitted for a sentence of seven months’ imprisonment for the voluntarily causing hurt charge. The sentencing framework for offences under section 323 PC as laid down in the High Court case of _Low Song Chye v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 140</span> (“_Low Song Chye_”) would thus be applicable. Given the victim’s injury of a comminuted right distal humerus facture, it was submitted that the indicative sentencing range would fall within the higher range of Band 2, which ranges from four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment (see \[77\], \[78(a)\]). It was submitted that the indicative sentence of five months’ imprisonment would be appropriate for the following reasons:

> (i)     In the case of _Low Song Chye_, the High Court found that the indicative starting point of two to three months’ imprisonment would be appropriate in view of the victim’s mild loss of hearing and tinnitus, albeit the hearing loss was non-permanent in nature but had affected the victim’s sleep at one point (see \[88\], \[91\] and \[94\]).

> (ii)     Crucially, it was also observed by the High Court in _Low Song Chye_ that a fracture would generally speaking be taken to be more serious than non-permanent hearing loss (see \[90\]). In this regard, the High Court was making a comparison with the injuries sustained by the victim in _Low Song Chye_ and the simple nasal fracture that the victim suffered in _PP v Holman Benjamin John_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 824</span> (see \[89\]).

> (iii)     The comminuted right distal humerus fracture suffered by the victim in the present case was clearly significantly more serious than a simple nasal fracture, which necessitated surgery. Further, the victim’s post-operative recovery was complicated by wrist drop, which developed on the night of the surgery. The victim had lost some function of her radial nerve temporarily, thereby causing her to have difficulty extending her wrist and fingers. She was given hospitalisation leave from 15 December 2018 to 27 June 2019. In P2, it was stated that the victim was able to perform computer work but should not be carrying loads. On the first day of trial on 13 August 2020, the victim was ‘clearly still debilitated by the injury insofar as the movement of her arm was limited due to pain. She was unable to demonstrate for the Court with her right arm how the accused had twisted her arm’[^87].

89     The sentencing bands in _Low Song Chye_ (as stated at \[77\]) were meant for accused persons who have pleaded guilty, where a discount to the sentence arising from the plea of guilt would have been applied. It was submitted that a one-month uplift was necessitated given that ‘appropriate calibrations’ would have to be made where offenders have claimed trial (see \[78\]).

90     Turing to the next step, the prosecution submitted that a further uplift of one-month’s imprisonment was warranted given that the current case involved family violence where public policy required that a deterrent sentence be imposed in such cases for two reasons, namely, (a) violence in the familial context constitutes an abuse of the bonds of trust and interdependency existing between family members, and (b) there is a need to protect vulnerable members of the family such as wives and children (see _PP v Satesh s/o Navarlam_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 119</span> at \[13\] –\[14\]; see also _PP v Luan Yuanxin_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 613</span> at \[17\])[^88].

#### For the rash act charge

91     The prosecution submitted for a short custodial sentence, with the quantum of the period of incarceration, left to the court, for the following reasons[^89]:

> (i)     The accused’s hand had in fact hit Z’s head on the first two slaps (see \[18\] above). After the third slap, the victim moved away and pushed the accused on the chest. It was submitted that there was a danger to Z’s personal safety as the accused’s actions may cause the victim to drop him. There was danger that the accused had inadvertently hit Z when he slapped the victim, which was what happened in the present case.

> (ii)     After the first slap, the victim had specifically told the accused to stop as he had hit Z. Despite the warning, the accused slapped the victim two more times.

> (iii)     The danger was particularly great as Z was a vulnerable five-month old baby at the material time.

92     Given that there was no evidence of any injuries caused to Z, it was further submitted that a short custodial sentence would suffice. Additionally, the prosecution submitted for both sentences to run concurrently as the conduct relating to the rash act charge arose from the very same incident as the voluntarily causing hurt charge.

### Mitigation plea

93     In his oral mitigation, defence counsel submitted for community-based sentences (“CBS”) and sought for any of the following community orders to be imposed for both offences, namely, a Day Reporting Order (“DRO”), Community Service Order (“CSO”) or a Short Detention Order (“SDO”) or a combination of any of these orders, pursuant to section 338 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). It was submitted that a SDO imposed in combination with either a DRO and/or CSO would serve the sentencing considerations of deterrence, both general and specific.

94     In that regard, it was highlighted that the accused was working as a Grab driver and financially supporting his elderly parents. At the time of the sentence, the accused was granted overnight access to his child, Z, by the Syariah Court. It was submitted that the accused was a loving father to his young son and was capable of raising him to be a ‘bright and competent young man’.

95     In the event that the Court was not minded to impose community-based sentences, it was submitted by the defence that not all ‘claim trial’ cases, would necessarily result in an uplift from the indicative sentence, which, on the facts of the current case, would fall under Band 2 of the sentencing framework as laid down in _Low Song Chye_. In the table of sentencing precedents involving domestic violence tendered by the prosecution, it was noted that the sentences imposed range from eight weeks’ to four months’ imprisonment for voluntarily causing hurt offences. In that regard, it was submitted that the starting indicative sentence ought to be between two to three months’ imprisonment.

96     As for the rash act charge, it was submitted that a fine would suffice given that the accused had been enjoying unlimited access with Z and that he was bonding with his child. That said, counsel had further urged the court to consider the fact that the accused may not be in a position to pay a fine given that counsel was representing the accused under the Criminal Legal Assistance Scheme (CLAS).

97     An adjournment was granted for the accused to raise funds to make compensation to the victim, which amounted to about $2,836.78[^90]. The accused made compensation to the victim amounting to $1,000 prior to sentencing.

### Prosecution’s Reply

98     The prosecution objected to the imposition of CBS for the following reasons, and maintained its submission on the imposition of a global sentence of seven months’ imprisonment:

> (i)     The injury sustained by the victim was substantial.

> (ii)     Given that the current case involved domestic violence, public policy dictated that deterrent sentences be imposed (as per \[90\] above).

> (iii)     The table of sentencing precedents tendered showed that custodial sentences were usually imposed for domestic violence cases.

## Sentence

### Sentencing considerations

99     The prescribed penalty for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt under Section 323 PC is imprisonment of up to 2 years or with a fine which may extend to $5,000 or with both.

100    In relation to the rash act charge of endangering the personal safety of others, the punishment prescribed is imprisonment of up to 6 months, or with a fine which may extend to $2,500, or with both.

#### Deterrence as the dominant principle

101    As highlighted in prosecution’s submissions at \[90\] above, the principle of deterrence features prominently in offences of domestic violence. In _Wong Leong Chin v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2000\] 3 SLR(R) 560</span> (“_Wong Leong Chin_”) at \[49\], the High Court observed that “public policy requires that vulnerable members of the family such as wives and children should be protected from violence.” The High Court explained that a deterrent sentence in the form of imprisonment should be imposed in deserving cases of violence, while sentences of fines may be more appropriate only in less serious cases in which no or little violence is involved.

102    In the case of _Public Prosecutor v N_ <span class="citation">\[1999\] 3 SLR(R) 499</span>, highlighted in _Satesh_ at \[25\], the offender pleaded guilty to three offences against his wife, namely voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation. He had slapped her face, tied up her hands, gagged her and threatened to kill her. The offender’s sentence of a fine was overturned on appeal and enhanced to imprisonment of 18 months.

### The appropriate sentence

103    As noted by Tay Yong Kwang JA in _PP v Satesh s/o Navarlan_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 119</span> at \[22\] (“_Satesh_”):

> Community-based sentences were enacted by Parliament to target “offences and offenders traditionally viewed by the courts to be on the rehabilitation end of the spectrum”, such as “regulatory offences, offences involving younger accused persons and persons with specific and minor mental conditions” (Minister for Law, K Shanmugam, Criminal Procedure Code Bill (Bill No 11 of 2010) Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 422). Minister Shanmugam further explained that a SDO could be imposed where “rehabilitation is a key consideration” (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 May 2010) vol 87 at col 425).

104    The present offences clearly did not fall under the categories for which CBS was envisaged. In _Satesh’s_ case, the victim was the offender’s wife. The offender had pleaded guilty to one charge under section 65(8) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 2009 Rev Ed) (“WC”) for contravening a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”), and one charge under section 323 PC. One other charge under section 65(8) WC and one other charge under section 323 PC were taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purpose of sentencing. In relation to the section 65(8)WC charge, the offender returned home drunk in the wee hours of the morning. He entered the bedroom where the victim and their 5-year old daughter were, grabbed the blanket from the victim and bit her on her right leg. This was the subject matter of the section 323 PC charge which was TIC.

105    In relation to the section 323 PC charge which was proceeded with, the victim had asked the offender to wash up as he smelled of alcohol. She then brought their daughter out of the room as the offender was behaving strangely. The offender followed them, and an argument ensued. The offender then threw several punches at the victim and the victim took an umbrella to defend herself. However, the offender managed to land a punch on his wife’s left cheek. The offender grabbed the umbrella from the victim and used it to hit her on both flanks. Their daughter witnessed this. He tried to stop the victim from leaving the flat and chased her to the lift when she left. The victim suffered from tenderness over her left cheek, forehead, left side of neck and left chest wall with thoracic region.

106    The High Court in _Satesh_ had rejected defence’s submission for CBS to be imposed as there was nothing to suggest that the offender’s capacity for rehabilitation was so promising that the option of community-based sentencing would be appropriate (see \[23\]). Given the offender’s history of alcohol abuse and propensity of violence against his wife as well as his high level of culpability, there was a strong need for specific deterrence against the offender. Bearing in mind all the circumstances, Tay JA held at \[23\] that the “some prospect” at rehabilitation mentioned by the DJ could not override the clear need for punishment to emphasise to the offender and other like-minded persons that family violence cannot be tolerated, and that voluntary intoxication worsens rather than mitigates the offences. On appeal, the 14-day SDO and DRO for 9 months was substituted with imprisonment terms. A sentence of five weeks’ imprisonment was imposed for the section 323 PC charge and three weeks’ imprisonment for the charge under section 65(8) WC. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

107    Whilst there was no evidence of voluntary intoxication or that there were previous acts of domestic violence levelled against the victim by the accused for the present case, I did not think that CBS would be appropriate given the serious nature of the injury sustained by the victim in the present case, namely, a comminuted right distal humerus fracture, and the fact that the present charges also involved family violence. In the case of _Satesh_, CBS was rejected on appeal and imprisonment terms were nonetheless imposed, where the injuries sustained by the victim were far less serious than the injuries sustained by the victim in the present case.

108    Further, there was no evidence before me either of the accused’s capacity for rehabilitation which was ‘so promising’ that the option for CBS would be appropriate in the present case.

109    In determining the appropriate sentence for the present case, the High Court case of _Low Song Chye_ would be instructive. Defence counsel had agreed that if this court was not minded to consider CBS as a sentencing option, the indicative sentencing range would fall under Band 2 of the sentencing framework as laid down in _Low Song Chye_, based solely on the actual harm caused, which would be between four weeks’ to six months’ imprisonment.

110    Under Band 2 of the sentencing framework in _Low Song Chye_ at \[77\], which would be applicable for a first-time offender who pleaded guilty, the harm caused is “moderate harm: hurt resulting in short hospitalisation or a substantial period of medical leave, simple fractures, or temporary or mild loss of a sensory function”.

111    As noted in \[88(iii)\] above, I was mindful of the extent of the victim’s injury which necessitated surgery, the complications which developed during the surgery and the post-surgery recovery, as well as the fact that the victim was only certified to perform computer work and not carry loads, some five months after the incident. The victim did not appear to have fully recovered from the injury at the commencement of the trial in August 2020, which would have been about one year eight months post incident as she still had limited movement in her arm. Whilst I am cognisant that the victim was unable to demonstrate fully how the accused had twisted her arm at trial due to limited movement in her arm then, I am of the view that the indicative starting point would, nonetheless, be about four to five months’ imprisonment, which would have been above the mid-point of Band 2.

112    In the second step of the inquiry, there were a number of factors to be considered which included the accused’s culpability as well as other relevant factors. Given that the accused and the victim were in a marital relationship at the material time, general deterrence would be the dominant sentencing consideration (see \[101\] – \[102\] above), where the sentence to be imposed ought to reflect the court’s disapprobation that spousal violence will not be condoned. Whilst it was undisputed that there was a verbal argument between parties prior to the commission of the offences, I did not think that the accused should have given vent to his frustrations, which would warrant a further uplift from the indicative sentence of four to five months’ imprisonment.

113    From the table of sentencing precedents tendered by the prosecution, I noted the case of _PP_ v _Liu Yongfu (DAC 925420/2019) (“Liu Yongfu”)_, which involved family violence, where following a dispute, the offender grabbed hold of the victim’s neck and shoved her down onto the floor. He kicked, punched and slapped the victim several times, wherein the victim sustained a right orbital floor fracture, left scalp hematoma, facial contusion and right tympanic membrane traumatic perforation. She was treated conservatively and discharged well with outpatient eye review. The accused had pleaded guilty and was a first offender. He was sentenced to four months’ imprisonment.

114    Whilst I am mindful that _Liu Yongfu_ was an unreported case, it was decided after _Low Song Chye_. I am of the view that this case would be a useful guide to show where cases of such nature (involving family violence) would fall in the sentencing range as articulated in _Low Song Chye_.

115    The current case involved injuries which were more serious than that in _Liu Yongfu_, although I am mindful that the victim in _Liu Yongfu_ sustained a right orbital floor fracture, which was on a vulnerable part of her body, namely, her face. The offender in _Liu Yongfu_, however, pleaded guilty whereas the current accused had claimed trial where there was evidently a lack of remorse on his part, by casting aspersions on the victim in the course of the trial. I am thus of the view that a sentence above four months’ imprisonment was warranted.

116    Bearing in mind _Liu Yongfu’s_ case as well as taking into account the culpability of the accused as noted in \[112\] above, in my judgment, the indicative sentence of about six months’ imprisonment for the voluntarily causing hurt charge would be appropriate.

117    In relation to the rash act charge involving their son, Z, I am of the view that a short custodial sentence was warranted given that their son was only five months’ old at the time and was vulnerable. Notwithstanding the fact that there was no evidence of any injuries, a message ought to be sent that parents ought not to give vent to their anger, and in this case, their son was clearly in distress and crying, after the accused had slapped the victim, for which their son was the inadvertent second victim, so to speak.

118    That said, I am also mindful that the accused was a first offender for violence related offences.

119    Whilst the accused had made voluntary compensation, albeit partial compensation and also at a late stage, I am nonetheless prepared to give some weight that the victim had been compensated, as this would have marginally lessened the offender’s culpability (see _PP v S Elamparithi_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 67</span>, where a sentence of 3 weeks’ imprisonment was reduced to 10 days’ imprisonment on appeal).

120    All considered and given the strong stance taken against family violence by the courts as highlighted above, I determined that a sentence of five months’ imprisonment for the voluntarily causing hurt charge and a one week’s imprisonment for the rash act charge was fair and appropriate. Given that both offences arose from the same incident, the sentences were thus ordered to run concurrently.
