Contract – Contractual terms

Contract – Breach

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in DCA 29/2020.\]

30 October 2020

### District Judge Ronald Gwee:

1       The plaintiff is a limited liability partnership, and the defendant is a sole proprietor, trading as Europe Mini Holiday.

2       The parties signed a Customer Service Agreement dated 8 October 2013 (the “Agreement”). The Agreement has to be read in conjunction with a signed Work Order (the “Work Order”), also dated 8 October 2013 (collectively, the “Contract”). In short, by the terms of the Contract, the plaintiff agreed to develop a mobile application for the defendant and the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff the aggregate sum of S$134,122.

3       It is the plaintiff’s case that they substantially performed their end of the Contract, save for the development of a mobile application specifically for use on Apple iPhones. The plaintiff says that they were ready, able and willing to develop this application, once it was discovered that they had not yet done so at the material stage.

4       It was the defendant’s case that the plaintiff’s failure to produce the iPhone application (in addition to other deficiencies in the delivery of services by the plaintiff, as claimed by the defendant) entitled the defendant to hold the plaintiff in breach of the Contract.

5       The plaintiff had rendered invoices totalling the aforesaid sum of S$134,122. It was not disputed that the defendant had paid a total sum of S$32,916. The plaintiff commenced this action, claiming the balance they say is due to them under the Contract, in the sum of S$101,206. Alternatively, the plaintiff claimed “a reasonable sum on a quantum meruit basis”. The plaintiff further claimed to be entitled to interest at the contractual rate of 1.5% per month, and costs, contractually agreed to be on an indemnity basis.

6       The defendant denied the plaintiff’s claim and mounted a Counterclaim against the plaintiff based on the alleged breach of the Contract on the part of the plaintiff.

7       In the Counterclaim, the defendant claimed the aforesaid sum paid, S$32,916, characterised as “damages for the unilateral revocation of the Contract by the (plaintiff)”.

8       The defendant further claimed S$42,129.80 “being damages for expenses incurred in hiring the photographer and extra staff” (in conjunction with the development of the application by the plaintiff), S$48,255.60 “being damages for loss of income”.

9       The defendant also claimed an indeterminate sum for “damages for embarrassment, loss of reputation and estimation by the (defendant’s) clients and business associates”, and “other general and/or special damages to be assessed”.

10     After consideration of all the evidence, and the respective closing submissions, I found that the defendant was not entitled, in the circumstances, to consider the plaintiff to have been in breach of the Contract. It was the defendant who had been in breach when they failed to pay the plaintiff for the balance of the work that had been done by the plaintiff (save for a deduction in respect of the non-development of the iPhone application, which the defendant ought to have allowed the plaintiff to develop).

11     Judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff for a sum of S$101,206 less a deduction of 5% of this sum, based on the (unchallenged by contrary evidence) expert evidence on behalf of the plaintiff that the undeveloped iPhone application was worth around 5% of the project costs. The expert had opined that the “Travel App is functional and in accordance with the scope of work”. As stated above, the plaintiff had, at the material time, not yet developed the application for iPhone devices. The plaintiff had already developed the application to be used on iPads, Android mobile telephones and Android tablets. The expert had also opined that in the period March/April 2015 (at about the time the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant had developed), the “iPhone component could have been added in at minimal costs”.

12     As often occurs in such commercial disputes, one can see, on hindsight, that parties would have benefitted at that time, had there been intervention of a third party who may have assisted to mediate matters in order to stave off future litigation. I found that the defendant ought to have allowed the plaintiff to develop the omitted iPhone application. The plaintiff was not, at that time, in breach of the Contract: they could still have delivered on their obligations under the Contract. Upon a consideration of all the evidence, it was my finding that the plaintiff had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that (save for the aforesaid iPhone application) the plaintiff had substantially performed their end of the bargain. At that point in time, the defendant had left, largely unpaid, the work already done by the plaintiff.

13     I did not allow the plaintiff’s claim for contractual interest at the rate of 1.5% per month. On this point, I agreed with defendant’s Counsel that this rate of contractual interest clothed this claim as a penalty. Nothing further need be said on this point, as there is no appeal on this issue. Interest at the usual rate of 5.33% per annum was allowed on the judgment sum, from date of Writ to Judgment.

14     The finding that the plaintiff had not been in breach of the Contract and that it was the defendant who had been in breach, led to a dismissal of the Counterclaim.

15     I upheld the plaintiff’s claim for costs to be assessed on an indemnity basis, having previously been contractually agreed as such between parties. Parties were agreeable to having costs for the action fixed by the Court. After hearing submissions on costs, I awarded costs for the claim and the counterclaim to the plaintiff (considered on an indemnity basis), fixed in the sum of S$18,000. Reasonable disbursements were also awarded to the plaintiff: these were to be taxed if not agreed.

16     The defendant appealed.

17     The defendant had raised the issue of the submitting, by the plaintiff, of a “Budgetary Quote” prior to the execution of the Contract. This Budgetary Quote had quoted a sum well below the aforesaid sum of S$134,122. The Budgetary Quote, as pointed out by the plaintiff, was not agreed to as binding, and signed by parties. Hence it could not form part of the agreement between the parties. The terms of the agreement would be encapsulated within the four corners of the documents making up the Contract as a whole.

18     The defendant pleaded that he had “intended to rely on Government grants to partially fund the project”. The defendant further pleaded that the plaintiff had “promised to only require payment when the Government grants were approved and disbursed”.

19     The plaintiff denied that this alleged promise would have formed part of the Contract. The “Government grant” in this particular case involved SPRING Singapore (“SPRING”). These grants, simply put, worked on a reimbursement basis. An applicant for a grant, such as the defendant, would only be able to claim reimbursement (after, perhaps, an initial “seed” payment) upon proof shown to SPRING of relevant and material payments made to vendors (such as the plaintiff). In any event, the terms of the Contract do not make prompt payment to the plaintiff subject to any reimbursement or release of funds from agencies such as SPRING. The plaintiff was entitled to rely on the provisions of the Contract with regard to payment.

20     The plaintiff also relied on clause 8.7 of the Agreement which provided that the “failure of either party to insist upon or enforce strict performance by the other of any provision … will not be interpreted or construed as a waiver … of that party’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision …”.

21     Even if the parties had agreed that the defendant could delay payment(s) to the plaintiff on account of non-receipt of payments received from SPRING, such would not have prevented the plaintiff from ultimately demanding payment from the defendant. Payment to the plaintiff by the defendant pursuant to the Contract was not made subject to payment(s) received from SPRING. The (staggered) payments under the Contract would be triggered by three pre-determined milestones, described as: “Signing of Work Order”, “Ready for UAT”, and “Passed UAT”. The term “UAT” refers to “User Acceptance Test(ing)”.

22     Such a “payment contingent provision” could not have formed a collateral contract either, as there was no consideration for such a promise, if there had been one. The plaintiff’s right to ultimately insist on payment, therefore, was not affected by any concession in not insisting on prompt payment earlier.

23     Another issue that had to be resolved in the trial was whether UAT had been carried out. The defendant said it had not been carried out. The plaintiff said that it had been, save for the iPhone application which had yet to be developed. The plaintiff said that the document that was said to have been signed by the defendant, signifying that UAT had been completed, had been lost or misplaced. On this point, upon a consideration of the evidence, I found that the plaintiff had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that UAT (save for the iPhone application) had indeed been carried out. The conduct of the parties at the relevant time, suggested that the plaintiff’s version of the progress of the project was to be preferred. The plaintiff led evidence to show that the defendant had logged onto the system on numerous occasions.

24     Matters came to a head upon the discovery of the non-development of the iPhone aspect of the application. The defendant claimed that “80% of the (defendant’s) customers use an iPhone”. Based on this assertion, if true, it would be clear why the defendant would have been displeased with the plaintiff’s deficient service in this regard. I found that the said figure of 80% as alleged by the defendant had been an exaggeration: evidence had not been led as to how the defendant came upon this figure. Indeed, the plaintiff’s expert opined that in 2015, “the ratio of iOS users vs Android users was around 1:4”. There was no evidence to support the figure of 80% as asserted by the defendant. To reiterate the plaintiff’s expert evidence, the “value of the iPhone component (was) around 5% of the project costs”, and that in March/April 2015, “the iPhone component could have been added in at minimal costs”.

25     The expert further opined that the “Travel App is functional and in accordance with the scope of work”.

26     There was an issue of the defendant relying on WhatsApp messages and emails from one “Derique Yeo” to buttress the defendant’s case of poor performance on the part of the plaintiff. The said Derique Yeo (“Derique”) was not willing to come to Court to give evidence. The defendant sought to rely on the said WhatsApp message and emails as evidence. The plaintiff resisted this, arguing, inter alia, that Derique was competent and compellable. There was no evidence that the defendant had sought for a subpoena to compel Derique to attend Court. The plaintiff maintained that the said WhatsApp messages and the emails did not come under s. 32 of the Evidence Act, and being hearsay, were inadmissible. I agreed with the plaintiff’s contention on this point. A subpoena could have been sought and served on Derique. In any event, even if the said WhatsApp messages and emails were admissible, I would ascribe very little weight to such documentary evidence in the absence of Derique. The plaintiff would have been entitled to cross examine Derique; and the defendant did not take further steps to attempt to secure Derique’s attendance in Court, content in relying solely on Derique’s stated reluctance to give evidence in this matter.

27     In the defendant’s Rebuttal Submissions, the defendant summarises the dispute between the parties as follows, reiterating “its position canvassed in its (defendant’s Closing Submissions) that the main issue before the court is whether there has been a breach of condition by the (plaintiff) by failing to deliver a working Travel App to the (defendant) and the consequences thereof”.

28     In the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions, the plaintiff concedes that the material clause 2.1 of the Agreement, read with the Work Order, was a condition. The plaintiff argued however, that the circumstances in the present case aligned with a situation where “the consequences of the breach are not so serious as to deprive the innocent party of substantially the whole benefit that it was intended that the innocent party should have”. The evidence showed that the rest of the application (save for the iPhone component) was functional, and the defendant had not been deprived of “substantially the whole benefit”. Further, the indication in the present case was that the iPhone component could have been added in with “minimal costs”. It should also be pointed out that, at that stage, it would not be wholly accurate to denote the defendant as the “innocent party”. The analysis shows that a large part of the plaintiff’s work had been completed without the resultant payment being made by the defendant.

29     The plaintiff also relied on clause 6.4 of the Agreement, titled “Effect of Termination”. This clause required the defendant, in the event of termination of the Work Order, to pay the plaintiff in respected of services that had already been rendered by the plaintiff. Such a clause would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Work already done for such contracts would not necessarily be “wasted”: as in the present case, it would only have taken the defendant’s agreement to have let the plaintiff complete the development of the iPhone component. After which, the defendant would have received the full package. In the circumstances, it could not be said that without the iPhone component the defendant had been deprived of substantially the full benefit of the Contract.

30     In the final analysis, after a consideration of all the evidence and the respective closing submissions of the parties, I found that the plaintiff had proven its case (save for the points raised above with respect to the iPhone component and the contractual interest) on a balance of probabilities against the defendant. I thus gave judgment to the plaintiff for 95% of the earlier sum claimed by the plaintiff, interest at the standard rate, and costs on an indemnity basis, fixed as mentioned above. The defendant was unable to prove that they should succeed on their counterclaim. The Counterclaim was thus dismissed.
