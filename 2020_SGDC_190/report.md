Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9761/202/01.\]

17 August 2020

### District Judge Christopher Goh Eng Chiang:

## Introduction

1       This is an appeal against sentence by the accused in person, a 37-year-old female.

2       The accused was originally charged on 20 July 2019 with one count of consuming methamphetamine under s 8(b)(ii) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) and punishable under s 33(4) of the MDA (“the First Enhanced Consumption Charge”).

3       She subsequently failed to attend court on 30 August 2019 and a warrant of arrest was issued against her. She was arrested on 24 November 2019. She was subsequently charged with four additional drug charges, including another charge for consuming methamphetamine (“the Second Enhanced Consumption charge”) and three charges for failing to report for urine tests on 14, 18 and 21 November 2019 while subject to a urine supervision order, an offence under r 15(3)(f) of the MDA (Approved Institutions, Medical Observation and Treatment and Rehabilitation) Regulations (Reg 3, 1999 Rev Ed) (”MDA Regulations”) (“the First”, “the Second” and “the Third” FRUT Charges respectively).

4       On 30 July 2020, the accused pleaded guilty to the following charges:

> (a)     DAC-935489/2020: the Second Enhanced Consumption Charge;

> (b)     DAC 901167/2020: the second FRUT charge; and

> (c)     DAC 901168/2020: the third FRUT charge.

5       The First Enhanced Consumption Charge and the First FRUT Charge were taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.

## The Statement of Facts

6       The Accused admitted to Statement of Facts (“SOF”) without qualification.

7       On 14 July 2019 at about 0445 hrs, the accused and a co-accused were arrested in Room 802 of JH Hotel located at 8 Lorong 10, Geylang. The accused was charged with the consumption of methamphetamine the next day and released on bail. She subsequently absconded. She was arrested on 24 November 2019 at 0135 hrs at 5 Lorong 18 Geylang.

8       Following her arrest, she was brought back to Bedok Police Divisional Headquarters (“Bedok Police HQ”) where the accused provided her urine sample for analysis. The samples were analysed by the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). Upon analysis, two Certificates under s 16 of the MDA were issued stating that her urine samples were found to contain methamphetamine. The presence of methamphetamine in her urine sample was the result of the accused consuming methamphetamine sometime before her arrest on 24 November 2019.

9       Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA and the accused was not authorised to consume it under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder.

10     The accused was placed under a urine supervision order made under r  15 of the MDA Regulations from 11 March 2019 to 10 March 2021. Pursuant to the supervision order, she was required to report to Bedok Police HQ every Monday and Thursday for urine tests. The accused failed to report for these urine tests on 25 occasions with no valid reason.

11     In particular, she failed to present herself for the said urine tests on 18 November 2019 (Monday) and 21 November 2019 (Thursday) without a valid excuse.

## Antecedents

12     The accused has a number of property and drug related antecedents dating back to 2002. These are set out below:

## Submissions on sentence

### Prosecution’s submissions

13     The Prosecution’s submissions are straightforward. For the FRUT charges, the Prosecution submitted for a sentence of at least 4 months to 6 months’ imprisonment. This was in line with the usual sentencing tariff for first time FRUT offenders.

14     For the Second Enhanced Consumption Charge, the prosecution submitted that whilst the usual sentence would be the mandatory minimum imprisonment term of three years’ imprisonment, in this case, an uplift of an additional 6 months’ imprisonment was sought. This was because the accused had already been charged for an enhanced consumption and had committed this offence whilst she had been on the run.

15     As two of the sentences had to run consecutively, the prosecution submitted for a global sentence of at least three years and ten months’ imprisonment.

### Mitigation plea

16     A written plea in mitigation was prepared by the defence.

17     The defence submitted a sentence of 4 months’ imprisonment in respect of the FRUT charges but submitted that that the court should impose the mandatory minimum imprisonment term of 3 years’ imprisonment of the Second Enhanced Consumption Charge. The defence submitted the various mitigating factors for this submission.

> (a)     Family problems. The accused has three young children and she is the sole caretaker. They are now in the care of their grandmother who is now old and sickly.

> (b)     Bad company. After her release from prison in 2019 for drug offences, she entered into a relationship with one Feroz who was a habitual drug abuser. He would cause the accused to miss her urine test appointments as he was afraid that she would report his drug use to the authorities. He had also taken videos of their sexual encounters and of her showering. She therefore began to rely on methamphetamine to cope. She has since lost contact with him.

> (c)     Depression. The accused had been a regular patient at the Institute of mental Health before her arrest, where she was treated for depression and stress. She also suffered from alcohol dependence and had suicidal tendencies.

## Sentencing Considerations

### The punishment prescribed by law

18     The punishment prescribed by law for the offences are as follows:

> (a)     For an enhance consumption charge under s 8(b)(ii) and punishable under s 33(4) of the MDA, the offence attracts a mandatory minimum of 3 years’ imprisonment; and

> (b)     For a charge of failing to attend a urine test pursuant to a urine supervision order under r 15(3)(f) and punishable under r 15(6(a) of the MDA Regulations, the offence attracts a maximum sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment or a fine of $10,000 of both.

### The appropriate sentence

#### The FRUT charges

19     Both the prosecution and the defence sentencing submission for the FRUT charges are very similar, albeit the prosecution’s submission was that the sentence should be _at least_ four months’ imprisonment whilst the defence’s submission was four months’ imprisonment.

20     I note that the usual sentencing range for a first time offender for a FRUT charge is a sentence of between four months to six months’ imprisonment. The following High Court cases are indicative of this range.

21     Notwithstanding that the accused had committed this offence whilst she was on the run and that she failed to attend urine tests on other 25 occasions, I was of the view that a sentence of four months’ imprisonment would suffice to meet the ends of justice.

#### The Second Enhanced Consumption Charge

22     I adjudged that the mandatory minimum sentence of three years’ imprisonment for an enhanced drug consumption charge in this instant was not justified. There were aggravating factors that would warrant an uplift from the mandatory minimum sentence for the Second Enhanced Consumption Charge.

23     First, I note that the accused committed the First Enhanced Consumption Charge not long after she was released from prison for consuming drugs. In 2018, the accused was sentenced to a total of 10 months and 6 weeks’ imprisonment with effect from 19 July 2018 for several charges, including one drug consumption charge. With remission, the accused would have been released from prison by the end of February 2019. Yet, within five months of her release, she committed the First Enhanced Consumption Charge.

24     Next, the accused had already been charged for the First Enhanced Consumption Charge in court when she absconded. In _Lin Lifen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 1 SLR 287</span> at \[50\], Chao Hick Tin JA was of the view that, the fact that an accused had absconded whilst out on bail is an aggravating factor because, amongst other things, it revealed a manifest intention to frustrate the proper operation of the law.

25     The accused did not surrender. She was arrested by police at 5 Lorong 18 Geylang on 24 November 2019. Her urine sample was then taken for analysis and it tested positive for methamphetamine. She had consumed drugs whilst on the run. In my view, this was also an aggravating factor to be considered when determining sentence.

26     I was therefore of the view that the uplift of six months’ imprisonment submitted by the prosecution was reasonable in light of the aggravating factors present.

#### Mitigating factors

27     I next considered whether there were any mitigating factors that would warrant a downward adjustment of the indicative sentences in both the FRUT charges and the Second Enhanced Consumption Charge. There were none.

28     The accused has blamed Feroz for causing her descent back into drug use after her release from prison in 2019. He had caused her to miss her urine test appointments and had circulated videos of their sexual encounters and nude photographs of her showering to other people. Feroz, a habitual drug user, also pressured her to consume drugs. She therefore started to rely on methamphetamine to help her cope with the stress and humiliation. In my view, this was neither here nor there. She could have and should have reported Feroz for abusing drugs. Instead, she chose not to, and took the easy way out, returning to drug taking. The fault laid with her. Accordingly, I gave very little weight to this.

29     The accused was the sole caretaker of her three young children who were now being looked after by their old and sickly grandmother. She hoped to be given a lighter sentence so that she could return home to be with her children. I also gave very little weight to this factor. The facts revealed that on both occasions, she was arrested not only arrested in the early hours of the morning (at 0445 hrs on 14 July 2019 and at 0135 hrs on 24 November 2019) but in Geylang, which was nowhere near her home. She was therefore not looking after her children and neither was she helping the grandmother look after them. There appeared to be very little caretaking on her part.

30     All considered, I was of the view that there was nothing at all in the accused’s mitigation that would warrant any downward adjustment of the indicative sentences in both the FRUT charges and the Second Enhanced Consumption Charge.

## Conclusion

31     For the above reasons, I was of the view that the following sentences imposed on the accused were fair and appropriate

32     Pursuant to s 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), I am required to order two of the sentences of imprisonment consecutively. I therefore ordered that the sentences of imprisonment in DAC 935489/19 and DAC 901168/19 to run consecutively with effect from 25 November 2019, the date the accused was first remanded into custody.

33     Accordingly, the total sentence imposed on the accused was 3 years and 10 months’ imprisonment with effect from 25 November 2019.

34     The accused, being dissatisfied with the sentence I have imposed, now appeals against it. She is presently serving sentence.
