2 December 2019

### District Judge Shaiffudin Bin Saruwan:

## INTRODUCTION

The Accused claimed trial to a charge of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276, 2004 Rev Ed)(“RTA”). The offence was alleged to have been committed on 15 Dec 16 at about 1.04 am along Jalan Bukit Merah whilst driving motorcar SDJ 8804 U.

## THE PROSECUTION’S CASE

2       The facts relied on by the prosecution were largely undisputed. The Accused had driven his motorcar after his dinner at a restaurant in Sentosa from about 8.00 pm to 9.00 pm on 14 Dec 16. During the course of the dinner, he had consumed alcohol. He left the restaurant after 12.00 midnight on 15 Dec 16. He was stopped at a police road block at about 1.04 am along Jalan Bukit Merah. He failed the preliminary breath test under s 69(1) RTA. He was brought back to Traffic Police Headquarters. There, at about 2.07 am, the BEA test was conducted under s 70(1) RTA. The result showed that there was 57 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. This was about 1.6 times above the prescribed limit of 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

3       The BEA test result slip evidencing the proportion of alcohol in the Accused’s specimen of breath was admitted into evidence (Exhibit P3). By virtue of s 71A(1) RTA, the burden fell on the Accused to rebut the statutory presumption that the BEA test was accurate. The prosecution’s case was that the Accused had not rebutted the statutory presumption.

## THE DEFENCE

4       The Accused’s defence was that he suffered from a medical condition called Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (“GERD”) which had elevated the BEA test result. This was because GERD caused alcohol from the Accused’s stomach to be regurgitated into the Accused’s mouth due to refluxes, for instance, when the Accused burped. The regurgitated alcohol in the Accused mouth affected the BEA test result.

5       The defence version was as follows - the Accused had arrived at Sentosa at about 8.15 pm for dinner with the owner of the restaurant. The Accused’s Sales and Marketing Manager and some other people were also present. They started off by having some wine. The Accused claimed that his first few sips were on an empty stomach as he had not eaten any food prior to drinking the wine. Dinner was at 8.30 pm. It consisted of, _inter alia_, spicy Chinese crab. During the course of the dinner, the Accused had continued drinking wine. All in all, he had about three glasses of wine. He stopped drinking at 10.00 pm, from which point he started drinking water.

6       Dinner ended at 12.15 am. Whilst he was walking to the carpark, the reflux symptoms kicked in, causing him discomfort. He purged in a toilet, then took Panadol and Veragel to counter the sudden gastric effect. He drove the Car until he was stopped at the road block. When he was escorted to Traffic Police, he had burped intermittently so much that he suffered a strong burp that led to vomitus being regurgitated into his mouth but he swallowed it. The Accused claimed that the burping continued to trouble him even as he was subjected to the BEA test. He claimed that he had a slight burp when he took the last BEA test that showed the reading of 57 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

7       In support of his assertion that he suffered from GERD, he produced a medical report dated 19 Jan 17 prepared by Dr Tan Chi Chiu (“Dr Tan”). In the medical report, Dr Tan had diagnosed the Accused as suffering from “mild chronic gastritis”.

8       The defence called an expert witness to rebut the presumption that the BEA reading was accurate. He was Dr Chuang Wei Ping (“Dr Chuang”), a family physician who ran a clinic, M/s West Point Clinic. In his report D2, Dr Chuang concluded that the breathalyser and BEA readings “_…should be disregarded as unsafe as a reliable guide to the amount of alcohol ingested_”[^1]. In particular, he commented that –

> “At 2.07 am at Traffic Police, the true BrAC would read as 5 micrograms/100ml breath. There would still be alcohol in the stomach at this time. If the accused was awakened from a lying position to take the test, the chance of alcohol refluxing closer to the mouth is higher than if he had been standing for an hour or so. A burp at the time of taking the Br AC test could have sent the reading off to over 100 units or more.”[^2]

## ANALYSIS OF THE DEFENCE CASE

## The BEA Test Result

9       The Accused’s version that he had suffered from intermittent burping because of his GERD when he was stopped at the road block, and that he had burped when he took the BEA test which resulted in the reading of 57 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, was against the weight of the evidence. The reasons were set out below.

10     Sgt Muhammad Afiq Bin Johari (“Sgt Afiq”) was the arresting officer and was one of the officers who had manned the road block that stopped the Car driven by the Accused. He testified that the Accused had smelt of alcohol but his gait was steady. Before administering the breathalyser test, Sgt Afiq had asked the Accused whether he had any illness or breathing difficulty, and the Accused had replied no. Sgt Afiq also rejected defence counsel’s suggestion that the Accused had informed him that he (the Accused) had eaten chilli crab earlier that night and was suffering from indigestion. He also steadfastly maintained that he did not recall that the Accused had been burping intermittently that night, despite being asked numerous times about it.

11     SSgt Meldric Lim Yuqi (“SSgt Meldric”), the BEA machine operator attached to Traffic Police, had testified that the Accused had not made any complaint of any medical condition when he was asked before the BEA test was conducted. He also testified that he had not observed the Accused burping when the BEA test was conducted. More significantly, he explained that it was not possible for the Accused to have burped at the time of the BEA test because the BEA machine would stop the test immediately because there would have been an obstruction in the airflow.

12     I found it inexplicable that both police officers did not recall the burping episodes if indeed the Accused had been intermittently burping that morning. This is pertinent given the protocol which the Traffic Police observed in relation to subjects who were to be made to undergo BEA testing. SSgt Medric testified that before conducting the BEA test, he verified with the Accused whether he was fit to take the test, and whether he had any medical or other health problems. If the answer to any of these questions was ‘no’, then he would consult their in-house doctor, and if necessary, the Accused would be conveyed to the hospital for a medical examination[^3]. The Accused’s intermittent burpings would have been obvious to any observer. It would logically follow that SSgt Medric would have been alerted given that it was mandated on him to ensure that the Accused did not have any medical or other health problems before he administered the BEA test. The fact that neither he nor Sgt Afiq had recalled the intermittent burping showed that the burping episode was a fabrication by the Accused.

13     This conclusion was supported by the fact that the BEA test was successfully conducted and a reading recorded. If indeed the Accused had burped at the point the test was conducted, then as SSgt Medric had pointed out, the BEA machine would have stopped the test because the airflow was obstructed due to the burping. I accepted the evidence of SSgt Medric on this point. As of 15 Dec 16, he had been with Traffic Police for four years, and he had done numerous BEA tests. Therefore, he was very familiar with the BEA machine, and the conditions required for its correct use.

## The Accused’s Consumption of Wine

14     The Accused assertion that he had consumed three glasses of wine earlier that night. However, there were significant inconsistencies in his evidence on this issue that cast some doubt on its credibility. He gave not less than three different versions of his wine consumption. At the road block, he told Sgt Afiq that he had consumed two glasses of wine before driving his car. This information was recorded by Sgt Afiq in Exhibit P2. Later that same day, he had informed SSgt Meldric that he had consumed four glasses of wine at about 9.00 am before he drove the Car[^4]. Subsequently, his version changed yet again when he gave his statement (Exhibit P4) on 15 Dec 16. In P4, he said he had consumed about three glasses of wine.

## Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

15     The key evidence in support of the defence assertion that the Accused suffered from GERD was a medical report dated 19 Jan 17 prepared by Dr Tan. It was significant to note that Dr Tan had actually diagnosed the Accused with “mild chronic gastritis”, and not GERD. Perplexingly, the conscious decision was made not to call Dr Tan as a witness for the defence despite various adjournments being given to ascertain the doctor’s availability. As such, the medical report was never formally admitted into evidence. As far as the Court is concerned, there is no evidence that the Accused was suffering from GERD, or from any other medical condition. On that basis alone, the Accused’s defence would have failed.

16     Even if the Accused was indeed suffering from GERD at the time of the offence, his defence could not stand. A key plank to the GERD defence was that the alcohol from the Accused’s stomach was regurgitated into his mouth due to refluxes caused by the GERD, for example, when the Accused burped. Therefore, it was that regurgitated alcohol from the stomach which led to the reading in the BEA machine. The underlying premise for this defence was that there was still significant alcohol in the Accused’s stomach at or around the time the BEA test was conducted. It should be noted that the BEA test was administered some four hours after the Accused had, based on his own evidence, last consumed wine on the night of 14 Dec 16.

17     In rebutting the GERD defence, the prosecution called an expert witness, Professor Edmund Jon Deoon Lee (“Prof Lee”), Professor with the Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore. Prof Lee has extensive expertise in the field of pharmacology as set out in his curriculum vitae (Exhibit P6). He had also written numerous articles published in the established scientific journals.

18     Prof Lee rebutted the defence’s argument that there was still significant alcohol in the Accused’s stomach at the time of the BEA test, such that when the Accused burped, the alcohol was regurgitated into his mouth and this had led to the high BEA reading. The s salient excerpts of his opinion as set out in his report (Exhibit P7) were –

> “    Alcohol is rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion, regardless of GERD. According to published absorption rate constants of alcohol absorption in fed state, absorption is practically completed 2 hours after ingestion, meaning there is very little alcohol in stomach or intestines by 2 hours after ingestion.”

19     In support of his opinion, he referred to a graph representing the absorption of alcohol in the stomach/intestines[^5]. The graph showed that even for slow absorbers, alcohol absorption was practically complete by two hours after ingestion, and there was minimal alcohol content in the stomach/intestine. Correspondingly, there would have been negligible amounts of alcohol left after three hours and even less after four hours. His view was therefore that it was unlikely that there would have been a significant amount of alcohol left in the stomach to be reflux during both the breathalyser test and the BEA test. He concluded that “_… the amount of alcohol present in the stomach two hours after ingestion would be insignificant and would not affect the BEA test results even if there was reflux_”. Further, Prof Lee opined that it was likely that the Accused had consumed more than three glasses of wine to account for the BEA test result of 57 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millimetres of breath[^6].

20     His conclusion above was supported by the prevailing literature. Two of these articles were tendered into evidence by the prosecution[^7]. In Exhibit P8[^8], which was the first controlled investigation into the impact of GERD on the reliability of breath-alcohol analysis, the authors concluded that -

> “\[A\]s absorption proceeds through the gut-wall, the concentration of alcohol in the stomach decreases exponentially… . Gastric emptying increases the speed of alcohol absorption appreciably and the concentration in the stomach decrease more rapidly. About 90 \[minutes\] after the end of drinking, when the BAC-profile enters the post-absorptive phase, the concentration of alcohol in the stomach should be roughly the same as that in the peripheral venous blood. Accordingly, if gastric reflux occurred 90 \[minutes\] or more after the end of drinking it should not compromise the results of an evidential breath-alcohol test because the concentration of alcohol in the gastric fluid at this time is relatively low and probably similar to that of musous secretions in the mouth and upper-airway.”[^9] (Emphasise mine)

21     The conclusions in P8 was corroborated in a separate study done in 2015 (Exhibit P9)[^10]. The authors in P9 concluded that “GERD-related alcohol leakage from the stomach into a breath sample \[was\] therefore an essentially irrelevant source of potential error in forensic breath testing”[^11]. This was because “the alcohol vapor \[sic\] from the stomach must diffuse throughout the esophagus at a slow rate compared to the rapidly moving stream of expired breath from the lungs. Alcohol should therefore be expected to be partially or completely absorbed into the wall of the esophagus before it \[reached\] the pulmonary air stream, …”[^12] . The authors also concluded that –

> “Even though there may be constant venting of alcohol-laden vapor \[sic\] from the stomach some, or at low alcohol concentrations, all the vented alcohol \[would\] be absorbed in the esophagus”[^13]. (Emphasise mine)

22     I accepted the opinion of Prof Lee over that of Dr Chuang’s. Dr Chuang did not furnish any cogent evidence in support of his opinion that there was sufficient alcohol content present in the Accused’s stomach at the time of the BEA test and that this had affected the test result. More pertinently, during cross-examination, he made significant concessions that undermined his own conclusions on the issue. Firstly, when crossed examined on the findings in P8, he conceded that he agreed with the findings by the authors that the rate of absorption of alcohol in the stomach was very rapid, so much so that after 90 minutes, there would not be any significant amount of alcohol in the stomach[^14]. Second, he also agreed with Prof Lee’s conclusion in his report that alcohol was rapidly absorbed after oral ingestion, and absorption was practically completed two hours after ingestion, thereby leaving very little alcohol in the stomach or intestines thereafter[^15]. Lastly, he conceded that his opinion was based on the assumption that the Accused had consumed three standard drinks and that it was possible that he had consumed more, which would account for the BEA test reading[^16].

23     All considered, I rejected the Accused GERD defence as it was against the weight of the evidence adduced. I accepted the prosecution’s case that the Accused was not suffering from GERD. And even if he was suffering from GERD, I was satisfied that the scientific evidence proved that it did not affect the accuracy of the result of the BEA test.

24     The Accused is a first offender.

## THE SENTENCE

25     The prosecution submitted that based on the sentencing framework in Edwin s/o Suse Nathen[^17], the sentencing range was a fine between $2000/- and $3000 and a disqualification order between 18 to 24 months. He submitted that the fine and disqualification order should fall on the upper end of the range as there was a lack of remorse displayed.

26     Mr Singh highlighted that as a businessman, the Accused required his driving licence. He disagreed on the point of lack of remorse, stressing that the Accused had claimed trial because of his medical condition. The trial had also been conducted expeditiously and reasonably. The defence asked for a sentence on the lower end of the range.

27     In this regard, the Accused could not avail himself of the sentencing discount that would be accorded to those who pleaded guilty. And any plea of remorse would be moderated by the fact that he had not pleaded guilty. As for the trial proper, I noted that the case was adjourned for some time to enable the defence to obtain Dr Tan’s presence in court. This was because firstly, his evidence was critical to the GERD defence, and secondly, the defence confirmed that they would be calling him to testify. But after time was given, the defence came back to say that they had decided not to call Dr Tan. So I would disagree with the defence’s argument that the matter had been prosecuted expeditiously.

28     In any event, I gave significant weight to the fact that the Accused was a first offender. Given that the BEA reading was 57 micrograms, I fined him $2500/- in default two weeks’ imprisonment. On disqualification, the fact that he required his driving licence on account of his business was not relevant. However, there was no additional aggravating factor to impose a disqualification period longer than the lower end of the range. As such, I ordered that he be disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 18 months with effect from 31 Jul 19.

29     The Accused is currently on bail pending the appeal.
