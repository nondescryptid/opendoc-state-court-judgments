Civil Procedure – Discovery of documents – Affidavits – Whether the court has the discretion to make an order for discovery if the party has stated on affidavit that he/she no longer has power, custody or possession of the documents sought

28 February 2022

### Deputy Registrar Lewis Tan:

1       The Plaintiff, Ms Wong Leng Si Rachel, is a full-time social media influencer with a wide-ranging presence on the internet platform Instagram.[^1] Sometime in December 2019, the Plaintiff became legally married to Mr Anders Aplin (“Mr Aplin”). The marriage, however, was short lived, and annulment proceedings were commenced in April 2020, and the marriage was legally annulled on or around March 2021.[^2]

2       Around December 2020, while the annulment proceedings were still ongoing, Ms Olivia Wu Su Han (hereinafter “the Defendant”), a Singaporean citizen who also maintains her internet presence on Instagram,[^3] began posting several “Stories” on her Instagram account. These Stories were entitled “_Cheaterof2020_” and were targeted at the Plaintiff. In brief, they suggested that the Plaintiff had been unfaithful to Mr Aplin, and several accounts of such alleged conduct were also fleshed out in detail (collectively, “the Stories”).[^4]

3       According to the Plaintiff, the Stories were defamatory and caused her to suffer damage to her reputation, standing and esteem. This was particularly damaging as the Plaintiff was a full-time social media influencer who was “largely dependent on her social media reputation, optics and image in order to attract and obtain business deals on partnerships … from which she relies on to earn her living”.[^5]

4       In her Defence, the Defendant countered that the Stories were not defamatory because, amongst others, they were true in substance. This was because the Plaintiff had been intimate with at least two individuals, namely one Mr Han, who was the Plaintiff’s gym trainer, and Mr Wan, who was the emcee at the Plaintiff’s and Mr Aplin’s wedding.[^6]

5       To bolster her defence, the Defendant took out the present summons for discovery, wherein she sought an order for the Plaintiff to disclose the following:[^7]

> (a)     correspondence exchanged between the Plaintiff and Mr Han from the date when the Plaintiff was in a romantic relationship with Mr Aplin up to April 2020 (_ie_, when the Plaintiff and Mr Aplin commenced annulment proceedings);

> (b)     correspondence exchanged between the Plaintiff and Mr Wan from the date when the Plaintiff was in a romantic relationship with Mr Aplin up to 27 August 2021 (_ie_, when the present Suit was commenced by the Plaintiff against the Defendant); and

> (c)     the Plaintiff’s diary entries (whether in hard copy or digital form) relating to Mr Wan from the date when the Plaintiff was in a romantic relationship with Mr Aplin up to 27 August 2021.

6       The Plaintiff resisted the Defendant’s discovery application, alleging that it was a “fishing expedition” designed to infringe upon her privacy and confidentiality.[^8] Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr Clarence Lun Yaodong (“Mr Lun”) also submitted that as the Defendant did not know the Plaintiff prior to posting the Stories, the documents sought could not be materials from which she could base her defence of justification, and this accordingly “defeat\[ed\] the point of relevance and necessity”.[^9]

7       In my view, there was little merit in the latter submission. As the Court of Appeal observed in _Review Publishing Co Ltd and another v Lee Hsien Loong and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 1 SLR 52</span> (“_Review Publishing_”) at \[134\], a defendant that seeks to rely on the defence of justification needs “only prove that the substance or gist of the offending words … is true”. There is no added requirement that the defendant ought to have known the plaintiff prior to making said statements. In this respect, “\[t\]he alleged defamer’s lack of knowledge of the relevant fact at the time of defamation is irrelevant since malice does not defeat the defence of justification” (_Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] 3 SLR 110</span> (“_Basil Anthony_”) at \[63\]). So, in making out the defence of justification, there was no onus on the Defendant to also show that she knew, at the time of publishing the Stories, that the statements therein were true because of her personal knowledge of the Plaintiff or otherwise.

8       Turning then to consider the relevance and necessity of the documents sought, it was important to first consider the salient parts of the parties’ pleadings. As particularised in the Statement of Claim and Defence at paragraphs 15 and 10 respectively:

**Statement of Claim**

**…**

> 15.    The Plaintiff avers that the Defendant’s Stories are untrue and defamatory to the Plaintiff. When read together with the title of “_Cheaterof2020_”, in their natural and ordinary meaning, and/or by way of innuendo, the Defendant’s Stories meant and/or were understood to mean: -

>> a.    The Plaintiff had committed infidelity on the day of her wedding, ie 27 December 2019;

>> b.    The Plaintiff had sexual relations with her wedding emcee, \[Mr Wan\]…, on her wedding night;

>> c.    The Plaintiff had no intention to marry her ex-husband, \[Mr Aplin\];

>> d.    The Plaintiff had caused more than one person’s life to be ruined;

>> e.    The Plaintiff was promiscuous;

>> f.    The Plaintiff was mentally unwell and that she should seek help;

>> g.    The Plaintiff does not have morals;

>> h.    The Plaintiff will not pass a character check by Mediacorp; and

>> i.    The Plaintiff was shameless.

**Defence**

…

> 10.    The Defendant avers that the Words, when read together with the title “_Cheaterof2020_”, in their natural and ordinary meaning bore and/or were understood to bear the following meaning instead: -

>> **Particulars**

>> (a)    The Plaintiff had been unfaithful to her ex-husband, Mr. \[Aplin\], in the course of their romantic relationship.

>> (b)    As a result of the Plaintiff’s unfaithfulness, Mr. \[Aplin\] had suffered emotionally.

>> (c)    The Plaintiff’s unfaithfulness shows that the Plaintiff lacks empathy and morals.

>> (d)    The Defendant was appalled by the Plaintiff’s unfaithfulness.

9       As can be seen from the above extracts, while the Plaintiff and Defendant disagreed on the precise meaning of the Stories, they were in agreement that the Stories suggested that the Plaintiff had been unfaithful to Mr Aplin. According to the Defendant, even if the contents of the Stories were defamatory, she was entitled to rely on the defence of justification as the contents of the Stories were true in substance and in fact:[^10]

> 16.    In this regard, the Defendant avers that if the natural and ordinary meaning of the Words, as pleaded at paragraph 10 above, are defamatory (which is denied), they were true in substance and in fact: -

>> **Particulars**

>> (a)    The Plaintiff had been unfaithful to Mr. \[Aplin\] while she was in a romantic relationship with Mr. \[Aplin\]. During this period and to the best of the Defendant’s knowledge, the Plaintiff had been more than intimate with at least two individuals.

>> (b)    Pending further discovery, the Defendant avers that during the said period, the Plaintiff had been more than intimate with, amongst others, a Mr. Han and Mr … Wan. Mr Han was the Plaintiff’s gym trainer. Mr … Wan is the Plaintiff’s friend. Mr … Wan was also the emcee of the Plaintiff’s and Mr \[Aplin’s\] wedding celebrations.

>> (c)    Mr. Han was engaged in intimate and sexual conversations through text messages on Telegram with the Plaintiff. The aforesaid conversations were exchanged when the Plaintiff was romantically involved with Mr \[Aplin\]. Screenshots of the said conversations are annexed at **Annex A**.

>> (d)    On the night of the Plaintiff’s and Mr \[Aplin’s\] wedding celebrations, the Plaintiff had spent the night with Mr. … Wan.

>> (e)    The Plaintiff had been intimate and had feelings for Mr. … Wan when the Plaintiff was romantically involved with Mr \[Aplin\]. In this regard, and pending discovery, the Defendant will rely on an intimate photograph of the Plaintiff with Mr … Wan and the Plaintiff’s diary entry which are annexed at **Annex B**.

>> (f)    As a result of the Plaintiff’s unfaithfulness, Mr. \[Aplin\] had suffered emotionally.

10     In my judgment, the documents sought were plainly relevant as they would go towards establishing whether the substance or gist of the Stories was true (_Review Publishing_ at \[134\]) and would thus adversely affect or support either the Plaintiff’s or the Defendant’s case, especially as regards the merits of the defence of justification: see O 24 r 5(3) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Ed) (“ROC”). For much the same reasons, such documents would also be necessary for the fair disposition of the matter: O 24 r 7 of the ROC.

11     Against this, Mr Lun strenuously emphasised that his client had categorically denied the allegations made by the Defendant. For example, in her Reply at paragraph 17, the Plaintiff denied the Defendant’s allegation that she had been engaged in intimate and sexual conversations with Mr Han. She also explained that while there was a photograph of her with Mr Wan, this was because she had spent the night with other friends along with Mr Wan, and she had merely fallen asleep on the sofa with Mr Wan. Her diary entry also only showed that she saw Mr Wan “as a friend who was giving her support and advice during a difficult time”. This, Mr Lun submitted, was why the Plaintiff had filed the present Suit, as none of the incidents as alleged by the Defendant had happened.[^11]

12     While the Plaintiff’s explanation could very well be true, this remained to be tested against the entire body of evidence. As Mr Quek submitted, such averments clearly put the issue of the truth of the Stories into issue. A denial of the other party’s pleaded case, whether in one’s own pleadings or affidavits, was plainly insufficient to render the issue moot and incontestable.

13     Mr Lun also stressed that the Plaintiff had confirmed on affidavit that she did not have in her power, custody and possession (“PCP”) any correspondence with Mr Han.[^12] In the same affidavit, she also confirmed that save for the diary entry exhibited in the Defendant’s Defence, there were no other diary entries relating to Mr Wan.[^13] According to Mr Lun, where a party has sworn on affidavit that the documents sought were no longer in the party’s PCP, there was “\[n\]o reason for \[the\] Court to exercise its discretion” to order the disclosure of such documents.[^14]

14     In support of this proposition, Mr Lun referred to the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar Tan Teck Ping Karen (“AR Tan”) in _QS-First Pte Ltd v Goh Tuan Keong and another_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGHCR 5</span> at \[45\], as follows:

> First, I would emphasise that this is an application made pursuant to O 24 r 5 \[of the ROC\]. The requirement under O 24 r 5(1) is that the party who is to disclose the documents is to “_to (sic) make an affidavit stating whether any document specified or described in the application or any class of document so specified or described is, or has at any time been, in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it.”_ **Once the party has filed an affidavit stating this, then there is no further reason for the court to exercise its discretion and make any order under O 24 r 5(1).** See \[_The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 689 v DTZ Debenham Tie Leung (SEA) Pte Ltd and Another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 98</span> (“_DTZ_”)\] at \[33\]…

> \[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis added in bold\]

15     As can be seen from the above extract, AR Tan referenced the decision of _DTZ_ at \[33\]. In _DTZ_, AR Goh Yi Han (“AR Goh”) stated at \[33\] that

> if the purpose of an order made under O 24 r 5 is to compel the other party to make an affidavit in the terms as stated in r 5(1), then it is **_arguable_** that if the other part\[y\] makes an affidavit on such terms in response to the application, the purpose of O 24 r 5 would be fulfilled. There is no further reason to make the order under O 24 r 5(1)… \[emphasis in original removed, emphasis added in bold italics\].

16     Reading on, AR Goh then went on to caution that the Court would not be without jurisdiction to make an order for discovery under O 24 r 5 merely because a party states on affidavit that it does not have the documents sought in its PCP. In such instances, the Court nevertheless retained the discretion to make an order for discovery (_DTZ_ at \[34\]). Having considered as such, AR Goh then concluded that the affidavit filed in that case was insufficient and ordered the production of the documents sought upon finding that they were "relevant and necessary to the substantive action" (_DTZ_ at \[35\]).

17     In other words, even where a party has stated on affidavit that the documents sought are no longer in the party’s PCP, the court remains seised of jurisdiction, and has the discretion to make an order of discovery notwithstanding the statement in the affidavit. This is consistent with the principle that at the interlocutory stage, the court should _generally_, but is _not_ bound to, accept a party’s affidavit as final and conclusive (see _Soh Lup Chee and others v Seow Boon Cheng and another_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR(R) 604</span> (“_Soh Lup Chee_”) at \[9\]).

18     For example, in _Harun bin Syed Hussain Aljunied and another v Abdul Samad bin O K Mohamed Haniffa and others_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 248</span>, the plaintiffs appealed against the assistant registrar’s decision to strike out the plaintiffs’ claim before trial. In dismissing the appeal, Tan Siong Thye J (“Tan J”) observed that while “the contents of the affidavit could generally be accepted before the trial”, this was not a rule that would apply in every case (at \[46\]). As such, Tan J did not accept the contents of the affidavit that the plaintiffs sought to rely on at face value because the explanation provided therein was “self-serving and conveniently shifted the blame” to another party (at \[46\]).

19     Similarly, in _Soh Lup Chee_, the first defendant asserted in his affidavits that he had provided all the documents required of him pursuant to certain discovery orders (at \[6\]). Nonetheless, the plaintiffs demonstrated that there was material non-disclosure of certain source documents by the defendants (at \[7\]–\[8\]). Hence, notwithstanding the statements made in the affidavits, Choo Han Teck JC (as he then was) ordered the defendants to comply with the discovery orders within 14 days, failing which the defence would be struck out for non-compliance (at \[12\]).

20     In this case, while the Plaintiff asserted on affidavit that she had deleted her messages with Mr Han given her “habit of consistently deleting old text messages and photographs to free up memory space”,[^15] I entertained doubts about the truth of this statement, which was self-serving and unsupported by any exhibit showing, for example, empty chat logs between herself and Mr Han.

21     The Defendant had also exhibited screenshots of messages exchanged between the Plaintiff and Mr Han which were disclosed during general discovery for the present action.[^16]_Despite these messages_, the Plaintiff stated on her affidavit for this application that her correspondence with Mr Han were deleted “long before \[she\] had even contemplated commencing an action against the Defendant”.[^17] If this were the case, how were the correspondence disclosed during general discovery procured? Furthermore, if the Plaintiff was indeed in the habit of deleting her old text messages and photographs to free up memory space, this begged the question as to why only her messages with Mr Han were deleted; in this regard, she patently omitted to state on affidavit that her messages and photographs with Mr Wan were similarly deleted, whether to free up memory space or otherwise.

22     The Plaintiff also stated that having reviewed her diary, she could “confirm on oath that there were no other diary entries relating to Mr … Wan”.[^18] However, the diary entry exhibited in the Defendant’s Defence (dated 6 January) provided some details of the Plaintiff’s then-fledgling feelings for Mr Wan.[^19] Given the detail in the diary entry, I entertained reasonable suspicion about the truthfulness of the Plaintiff’s self-serving statement that there were no further diary entries pertaining to Mr Wan, especially as the Plaintiff has since commenced a relationship with Mr Wan[^20] (see _Soh Lup Chee_ at \[9\], citing _Lyell v Kennedy_ (1884) 27 Ch D 1 at 20).

23     Having regard to the above, and also to the relevance and necessity of the documents sought to be produced, I exercised my discretion to order the discovery of all three categories of documents (see \[5\] above).

24     However, Mr Lun also argued that the Defendant’s application was defective as it had “not provided a certain time frame”, and this “\[l\]ack of specificity and broadness mean\[t\] that \[the application was\] nothing but a fishing expedition”.[^21]

25     I shared Mr Lun’s concerns that the time frame proposed by the Defendant was unduly broad and insufficiently specific. For one, the Defendant was seeking the production of documents commencing from an unspecified date, namely from the date when the Plaintiff was in a romantic relationship with Mr Aplin. While I noted this, I did not agree with Mr Lun that this rendered the Defendant’s application “defective”. Rather, as Mr Quek submitted, it remained within the Court’s discretion to limit the time frame of the documents sought to be produced, and the broadness of the time frame was not a bar to discovery.[^22]

26     Accordingly, to ensure that costs were not unduly incurred and that only documents necessary for the fair disposal of the matter were disclosed, I limited the discovery order as follows:[^23]

> It is ordered that the Plaintiff discloses the following documents to the Defendant within 14 days of this Order by filing and serving a List of Documents in respect of these:

>> 1.    All correspondence exchanged between the Plaintiff and \[Mr Han\] from June 2016 to June 2020;

>> 2.    All correspondence exchanged between the Plaintiff and \[Mr Wan\] from June 2018 to June 2020; and

>> 3.    All of the Plaintiff's diary entries relating to \[Mr Wan\] from June 2018 to June 2020.

27     The discovery order was stipulated to end in June 2020, this being two months after the commencement of the Plaintiff’s annulment proceedings with Mr Aplin. In my view, this end date was sufficiently precise and would weed out any personal communications that the Plaintiff could have had with either Mr Han or Mr Wan which would likely have little bearing on the present matter, and in particular to the Defendant’s defence of justification.

28     The start dates were differentiated as between Mr Han and Mr Wan as it appeared that the Plaintiff had met Mr Han earlier, and also stopped correspondence with Mr Han much earlier than in June 2020.[^24] Hence, an earlier start date (of June 2016) was stipulated for her correspondence with Mr Han to mitigate the potential need of a further application for discovery by the Defendant. The start date for the documents pertaining to Mr Wan were stipulated to start from June 2018 as a two-year period (ending June 2020) was in my view sufficient to cover relevant correspondence and diary entries (if any) and would ensure that the Plaintiff would not have to trawl through an unduly large body of correspondence in meeting the discovery order.

29     This was a District Court suit, and the arguments for the application, as well as the affidavits filed, were somewhat lengthy, and oral arguments took about half a day. While the discovery application was allegedly taken out late in the day, I found that this was not a reason for reducing the costs payable to the Defendant in this application as there would be nothing to prejudice the Plaintiff from seeking costs against the Defendant if, for example, a summons for further directions had to be taken out to extend the timelines provided in the earlier summons for directions. Given that the Defendant had succeeded in this application, and having regard to the principle of proportionality and the work done for the application, costs was fixed at $1,500 (all-in), to be paid by the Plaintiff to the Defendant.

30     The Plaintiff has appealed against the entirety of my decision.[^25]
