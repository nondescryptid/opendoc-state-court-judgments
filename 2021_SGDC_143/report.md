Criminal Procedure and Sentencing – Sentencing

Road Traffic – Offences – Driving whilst under a disqualification order

\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9133/2021/01.\]

29 July 2021

### District Judge Lorraine Ho:

## Introduction

1       The accused, a 34-year-old Singaporean male, had pleaded guilty before me on 25 May 2021 for three charges of driving whilst under a court’s disqualification order, driving without a valid policy of insurance and using a vehicle without a valid road tax in force. One charge of failing to deliver up his driving licence to the Traffic Police was taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. I convicted him and imposed a global sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment, fine of $1,200 in default 4 days’ imprisonment and disqualified him from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for a period of 12 months from the date of conviction and 42 months from the date of release from prison.

2       On 5 June 2021, the accused filed a Notice of Appeal because he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on him.

3       On 8 June 2021, I granted a stay of execution on both the sentence of imprisonment and the disqualification order pending the appeal. The accused has paid the fine in full.

## Background facts

### Statement of facts

5       The accused admitted to the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) dated 25 May 2021 without qualification.

6       On 27 November 2019 at about 9.49am, the accused was driving motorcar no. SLV5254T (“the motorcar”) along the Central Expressway (“CTE”) towards the Ayer Rajah Expressway (“AYE”) when he was stopped for checks near the 14km mark by an enforcement officer from the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”).

7       Upon screening, it was reviewed that the accused was driving the motorcar whilst he was under a disqualification order for all classes of vehicles for a period of 23 months from 30 May 2019 to 29 April 2021. As the accused was not a holder of a qualified class 3 Singapore driving licence at the time of the offence, there was no insurance policy or such a security in respect of third- party risks arising out of the use of the motorcar that is required under the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (“MVA”).

8       Further screening revealed that the accused was using the motorcar for which a valid licence under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (“RTA”) was not in force as the road tax of the motorcar had expired on 11 November 2019. Therefore, the accused had used the motorcar without renewing his road tax.

9       Consequently, the accused admitted to the offences in respect of the three proceeded charges and consented to have the remaining charge of failing to deliver up his driving licence to the Traffic Police (“TP”) to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

## Antecedents

10     The accused is traced for traffic related antecedents. On 30 May 2019, the accused was convicted for the offence of drink driving under s 67(1)(b) of the RTA and sentenced to a fine of $2,500 and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence (“DQAC”) for a period of 23 months. On the same day, he was also convicted for the offence of driving without reasonable consideration under s 65(b) of the RTA and sentenced to a fine of $500 and a DQAC of 3 months.

11     The accused confirmed his antecedents to be correct.

## Prosecution’s submissions on sentence

12     The Prosecution orally submitted for a global sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $1,400 and a DQAC of at least 48 months with effect from the date of release from prison.

13     For the driving whilst under a disqualification order charge, the Prosecution sought for a custodial sentence of 8 weeks’ imprisonment and a DQAC of at least 48 months.

14     The Prosecution highlighted that since the amendment of the RTA on 1 November 2019, the punishment for s 43(4) of the RTA has been enhanced for first and repeat offenders.

15     Prior to the 2019 amendments, the maximum prescribed punishment for both a first and repeat offender was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both. Now, the maximum prescribed punishment for a first offender is a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both. For a repeat offender, the maximum prescribed punishment is now a fine not exceeding $20,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 6 years or both.

16     In coming to its submissions, the Prosecution relied on the case of _Fam Shey Yee v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2012\] SGHC 134</span> (_“Fam Shey Yee”_), which was decided under the old s 43(4) RTA. In _Fam Shey Yee_, it was held by the High Court that the usual tariff for driving under a disqualification order was four to eight weeks’ imprisonment.

17     Therefore, with the amendments, the Prosecution submitted that the starting point sentence for a first offender like the accused in the present case would now be double that of the previous sentence of 4 weeks’ imprisonment That is to say that in view of the recent 2019 amendments, in order to utilise the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament (See _Poh Boon Kiat v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 892</span> at \[60\]), the new starting point sentence for a first offender should now be 8 weeks’ imprisonment.

18     Moreover, the accused’s behaviour was egregious because he committed the current offence only about six months into the earlier DQAC of 23 months imposed on him for drink driving. He was thus only about a quarter way through the period of disqualification which he was supposed to serve. This clearly indicated that he was in blatant disregard of the court order. He was also indifferent to the nature and seriousness of his earlier offences of drink driving as well as inconsiderate driving. As such, the need for both general and specific deterrence was required in the accused’s case.

19     As for the charge of driving without a policy of insurance being in force under s 3(1) of the MVA, the Prosecution sought for a fine of $800 and the mandatory minimum DQAC of 12 months.

20     For the charge of using the motorcar without a valid road tax in force, the Prosecution sought for a fine of $600.

## Mitigation

21     The Defence tendered a written mitigation and submitted for a mandatory treatment order or MTO suitability report to be called. Alternatively, the Defence sought for a global sentence of a fine of not more than $7,000 and DQAC of 24 months or a custodial sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment, a fine of $700 and DQAC of 24 months.

### Circumstances leading to the commission of the offence

22     On the material day in question, the Defence submitted that the accused was still at home in the morning when his ex-wife, who was still married to him then, called him from the office. She informed him that she had forgotten her medication and vitamins at her parents’ place and asked if the accused would be able to collect them for her and pass them to her during lunchtime.

23     By this time, the accused was already late for work. However, as his ex-wife had suffered a miscarriage in August 2019, which was a few months prior to the offence date, the accused felt he needed to collect the medication and vitamins for her as he did not want her to miss taking them for an entire day. He felt a sense of urgency as he was still experiencing bad memories of his ex-wife’s miscarriage. The Defence referred the court to his ex-wife’s medical memo from KK women’s and Children’s Hospital dated 10 May 2021.

24     During the hearing before the court, when asked what those medication and vitamins were, the Defence informed me that the vitamins were folic acid. This was confirmed in Dr Ung Eng Khean’s (“Dr Ung”) medical report of the accused dated 26 October 2020 at \[14\].

25     Following from there, the Defence submitted that the accused did not apply his mind further, took the motorcar key from the house, drove the motorcar and rushed to his in-laws’ home to get the vitamins before driving off to work. The accused had thought about taking the MRT initially but changed his mind at the last minute due to his sense of urgency in getting the folic acid.

26     Regrettably, while he was on his way to work, he was stopped by the enforcement officer from LTA and was caught driving whilst he was under a disqualification order.

### Mitigating factors

27     The Defence submitted that the accused was truly remorseful for committing the offences given his early plea of guilt. The accused accepted full responsibility for his actions and was regretful. He cooperated fully with the authorities. He was not a habitually negligent driver and the offences were a result of a momentary lapse and error of judgment. His mental state of mind at the material time of the offence for driving whilst under a disqualification order might have impaired his judgment as he felt that he was acting as a worried and concerned husband for his ex-wife who had recently suffered a miscarriage. Hence, he is unlikely to reoffend in the future and demonstrates a high propensity for reform.

28     Since November 2019, the accused has been working as a Business Development Manager with a company providing security services. Prior to that, he was doing some part-time work and running his own business. Despite the initial challenge and stress that he experienced with his new job, the accused now has a positive outlook at work and good relationship with his colleagues.

29     On 7 May 2021, the accused and his ex-wife divorced. However, together with his mother and siblings, she is still supportive of him during these difficult times. The accused said that his ex-wife was willing to provide a statement on his behalf. The accused’s parents were divorced when he was young.

30     As regards his psychiatric condition, the accused was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder in 2013 by the Military Mental (sic) Institute (also known as the Military Medicine Institute) when he was serving his National Service. He experienced depression during his Basic Military Training. He was given medication and underwent counselling during that period.

31     After the accused was arrested for the present offences, the accused decided to seek medical treatment at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”). In the memo from IMH dated 14 July 2020, Dr Charles Mak was of the opinion that the accused suffered from Major Depressive Disorder and was being treated with anti-depressant medication since 16 December 2019. As of 14 July 2020, the accused’s condition has improved but would require continued psychiatric medication and follow-up.

32     The Defence submitted that the accused’s condition was due to the guilt and shame he felt for his ex-wife’s miscarriage and failure to conceive as well as the stresses of his new job. Being aware that his mental condition has potentially worsened due to these stresses, he took the necessary steps to receive treatment for his medical condition at IMH on 16 December 2019.

33     Almost a year after the offence date, the accused decided to seek medical treatment and be assessed by Dr Ung. In Dr Ung’s medical report dated 26 October 2020, the Defence highlighted \[33\] and \[34\] of Dr Ung’s opinion that there was “_a link between states of depression and anxiety and poor judgment (decision-making) as well as increased impulsivity_”. Both these factors were pertinent contributory factors to the accused’s offending behaviour. Dr Ung was therefore of the opinion that the accused’s depressive disorder was “_a significant contributory factor in impairing his judgment leading to making poor decisions as well as increasing his impulsivity leading up to the offences_”.

34     The Defence therefore submitted that the accused’s actions were not stemmed from a disregard of the law but rather an uncharacteristic and impulsive decision made to care for his ex-wife as he deemed it an emergency to send the vitamins to her.

### Defence’s submissions on sentence

35     In its submissions on sentence, the Defence urged the court to consider calling for a MTO suitability report in view of the accused’s psychiatric condition.

36     Moreover, the accused’s culpability was low here because:

> (a)     He was not driving under the influence of alcohol and/or after having unlawfully consumed any controlled drugs;

> (b)     The incident was not exacerbated by the use of a hand-held mobile telephone or any other electronic device at the material time;

> (c)     He was not an overt danger to other road users by reason of his manner of driving the vehicle at the material time. In this regard, he did not lose or compromise his control of his vehicle or drive in a dangerous manner at any time. He had also not displayed a deliberate attempt to take a serious risk to execute a driving manoeuvre at the material time;

> (d)     No accident was caused and no public property whatsoever was damaged as a result of the offences; and

> (e)     The incident was not caused by disregarding warnings of road users, passengers or others in the vicinity, competitive driving, racing and/or showing off as well as prolonged, persistent and/or deliberate bad driving.

37     In the alternative, the Defence submitted for a global fine of not more than $7,000 for the three proceeded charges in view of the accused’s low culpability. The offences committed were also not serious.

38     The Defence cited the cases of _PP v Mohamed Riduan bin Mohamed Rahussin_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 149</span> (_“Mohd Riduan”_), _PP v Prathib s/o M Balan_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 161</span> (_“Prathib”_) and _Teo Rong Zhi Saimonn v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] SGHC 185</span> (_“Saimonn”_). These cases dealt with the offence under s 3(1) of the MVA and the typical sentence for a first offender ranges from $500 to $700 with the mandatory minimum disqualification period of 12 months.

39     In the circumstances and without providing further reasons, the Defence argued that the accused should be imposed with a fine of:

> (a)     $5,000 and a DQAC of 24 months for the s 43(4(a) of the RTA charge;

> (b)     $1,000 and a DQAC of 12 months for the s 3(1) of the MVA charge; and

> (c)     $1,000 for the s 29(1) of the RTA charge,

giving a total fine of $7,000.

40     Finally, if the court was minded to impose a custodial sentence so as to meet the ends of justice, the Defence, without giving any further reasons, was of the view that a sentence of three weeks’ imprisonment with a fine of $700 and a DQAC of 24 months would be fair.

## Reply

41     The Prosecution objected to the calling of the MTO suitability report. It further objected to the accused attempting to obtain his ex-wife’s statement at the eleventh hour, which the accused failed to provide such information during the investigation stage.

42     The Prosecution referred to \[15\] of Dr Ung’s medical report of the accused where Dr Ung recorded that the accused had in fact thought about taking an alternative means of transport like the MRT but the accused acted impulsively and did not do so. The accused accepted that he had acted unwisely and was remorseful for his aberrant behaviour.

43     Moreover, the Prosecution highlighted that this was not a medical emergency. The accused was only going to meet his wife during lunchtime to pass her the vitamins. He had ample time to do so. There was no justification for him to have driven the motorcar that day.

44     Further, at \[34\] of Dr Ung’s medical report, he did not comment as to whether the impulsivity of the accused had crossed the threshold of “legal causality”. Dr Ung also did not comment on the culpability of the accused in committing the offence. This was after all a strict liability offence, where the accused clearly knew that he was prohibited from driving because of the disqualification order imposed on him for drink driving.

45     Therefore, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s case did not meet the appropriate threshold for the MTO suitability report to be called. Here, the need for deterrence, both general and specific, and retribution clearly outweighed the principle of rehabilitation.

## Decision on sentence

46     The issues before me were as follows:

> (a)     Whether an MTO suitability report should be called in the present case; and

> (b)     If not, what is the appropriate sentence to be imposed on the accused.

### Principles for calling of a MTO suitability report

47     Even though it was the Defence who had submitted for an MTO suitability report to be called, I was completely unassisted by it in its submissions.

48     The basis for making an MTO by the court is found in ss 339(1) to (14) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap68) (“CPC”). Specifically, ss 339(1) to (4) state as follows:

>     Mandatory treatment orders

> 339.—(1)    Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), where an offender is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted _is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so_, the court may make a mandatory treatment order requiring the offender to undergo psychiatric treatment for a period not exceeding 36 months.

> (1A)  A mandatory treatment order may also require an offender to reside in a psychiatric institution during the whole or a specified part of the period that the offender is required to undergo psychiatric treatment.

> (2)    Before making a mandatory treatment order, the court must call for a report to be submitted by an appointed psychiatrist.

> (3)    A court may make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender only if the report submitted by an appointed psychiatrist states that —

>> (a)    the offender is suffering from a psychiatric condition which is susceptible to treatment;

>> (b)    the offender is suitable for the treatment; and

>> (c)    the _psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for his committing the offence_.

> (4)    A court must not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of an offender if the report submitted by the appointed psychiatrist states that he is not satisfied with any of the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) to (c). \[emphasis added\]

49     In the High Court decision of _GCX v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 1325</span> (_“GCX”_), it was held at \[37\] that the court should only contemplate calling for a MTO suitability report if there were sufficient facts showing that the offender had some rehabilitative potential and that rehabilitation would not be completely outweighed by other sentencing considerations.

50     See Kee Oon J set out in _GCX_ how a court should identify the appropriate threshold of an offender’s rehabilitative potential in determining whether to call for a MTO suitability report. At this stage, it was a balancing inquiry into the various sentencing principles and the threshold is lower than at the post-report stage where the court would have to consider whether to order the MTO itself. At \[47\], See J summarised the approach as follows:

>     I now summarise the approach I have laid out above. In my view, in considering whether to call for an MTO suitability report, the court should bear in mind the following. The court should identify and balance the relevant sentencing principles, giving each its appropriate weight. Having done so, the court would have some sense of the offender’s rehabilitative potential. The threshold to be met as to the offender’s rehabilitative potential before an MTO suitability report would be called for should not be overly restrictive. The court would need to be persuaded that rehabilitation was a real prospect, and that the other sentencing principles were not so dominant that rehabilitation should be rejected out of hand. This threshold incorporated the principle identified in \[59(g)\] of _Kong Peng Yee_, which recognised that other sentencing principles might so substantially trump the principle of rehabilitation that it was unnecessary to inquire further into the offender’s rehabilitative potential. The determination whether the threshold was met, and correspondingly, whether the scenario contemplated in principle (g) of _Kong Peng Yee_ applied, was intensely fact-dependent. The court should bear in mind, however, that it should not lightly find that other sentencing principles so substantially trumped the principle of rehabilitation that there was simply no need to call for the MTO suitability report. This caution was warranted because the court still lacked, at this stage, the necessary facts to apprise itself fully of the offender’s true rehabilitative potential.

51     Hence, based on the facts, the nature of the offence, the character of the accused and the circumstances before me, the court at this stage would have to identify and balance the relevant sentencing principles, assess the accused’s rehabilitative potential and whether other sentencing principles outweighed the prospect of rehabilitation or there was a real prospect of rehabilitation such that other sentencing principles were not so dominant that rehabilitation should outrightly be rejected.

52     With the approach as enunciated in _GCX_ in mind, I then applied the approach to the present case.

### The nature of a driving whilst under a disqualification offence

53     The nature of the driving under a disqualification order offence is that it is a strict liability offence. This was held by the High Court in _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) 581 (“_Chng Wei Meng”)_ at \[19\]. A person who drives a vehicle would invariably know whether or not he has in fact been disqualified to do so.

54     Furthermore, driving under a disqualification order is a serious road traffic offence. Yong Pung How CJ said in the case of _Chng Wei Meng v PP_ \[2002\] 2 SLR (R) at para \[43\]:

>     Driving while under disqualification is about as serious an offence as a motorist can commit. Not only does it compromise the safety of our roads; it also creates problems in ensuring adequate compensation for luckless victims.

55     As such, the mere act of driving under a disqualification order is all that has to be proven for the offence to be made out as held at \[23\] of _Muhammad Saiful Bin Ismail v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] SGHC 37</span> (_“Saiful”_). In Saiful, it was also highlighted by Sundaresh Menon CJ that some specific types of mitigating and aggravating factors for a s 43(4) of the RTA offence were (at \[27\] to \[38\]\]:

> (i)     Knowledge of the disqualification order;

> (ii)     Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law;

> (iii)     Length of time from expiry of original disqualification order; and

> (iv)     Weight of surrounding circumstances.

56     In _PP v Soyed Foysal Ahmed Pavel_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 131</span> (_“Pavel”_), the legislative intent for enhancing the punishment under s43(4) of the RTA for driving under a disqualification order via the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1993 (Act 3 of 1993) was discussed. The seriousness of the offence cannot be downplayed as an offender would deliberately ignore the court’s prohibition order by taking the chance to continue driving. Such an offender is akin to being a lethal and unguided missile as well as menace on the roads. At \[24\] of _Pavel_, it was quoted:

>     As the Minister for Home Affairs, Professor S. Jayakumar, explained in moving the second reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 1992 (Bill 37 of 1992), which proposed this enhanced punishment \[Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (18 January 1993) vol. 60 at col 426-428\]:

>> … There have been a number of cases ... where motorists who are disqualified by the courts from driving for committing a serious offence, have deliberately ignored the court’s prohibition and continued to drive. ...

>> According to the Traffic Police, there are more \[of\] such offenders, but it is not easy to catch them. The Traffic Police can detect them only when they are stopped for some traffic offence or when they are involved in an accident.

>> I hope Members will agree that such a driver is really a menace to all other road users. He is, in fact, a lethal, unguided missile. Moreover, when he causes an accident, the victims will not legally be covered by insurance. ...

57     Since the amendments to the RTA on 1 November 2019, the punishment for s 43(4) of the RTA has been enhanced for first and repeat offenders. The new 43(4) states:

> (4)    If any person who is disqualified as mentioned in subsection (3) drives on a road a motor vehicle or, if the disqualification is limited to the driving of a motor vehicle of a particular class or description, the person drives on a road a motor vehicle of that class or description, the person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction as follows:

>> (a)     _to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both;_

>> (b)    where the person is a repeat offender, to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 years or to both. \[emphasis added\]

58     Prior to the 2019 amendments, the maximum prescribed punishment for both a first and repeat offender was a fine not exceeding $10,000 or an imprisonment term not exceeding 3 years or both.

59     As regards the disqualification order, s 42(1) of the RTA continues to apply. S 42(1) of the RTA states:

>     A court before which a person is convicted of any offence in connection with the driving of a motor vehicle may, in any case except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act and shall, where so required by this Act, order him to be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for life or for such period as the court may think fit.

60     The rationale behind the enhanced punishment for the s 43(4) of the RTA offence is therefore unequivocally intended to protect the safety of the public as it prohibits persons without valid or subsisting licences from driving on our public roads and highways and endangering human lives. Moreover, a person who drives while disqualified will also not be in possession of a valid mandatory third-party insurance policy as required by s 3 of the MVA. Such offences, if committed, are also difficult to detect and offenders are often caught red-handed where they have either been stopped for some other offences (e.g. an accident) or on the off-chance when random checks are being conducted by the traffic police. In _Chng Wei Meng_, Yong Pung How CJ reiterated at \[19\]:

>     In my opinion, there were several factors, which strongly suggested that Parliament intended liability to be strict. Firstly, is the absence of any statutory defences for s 43(4) of the Act. Secondly, as is the case for the majority of strict liability offences, the offence of driving under disqualification is not a truly “criminal” offence but one that is regulatory in nature. Thirdly, s 43(4) is clearly concerned with the protection and safety of the public as it prohibits persons without valid or subsisting licences from driving on our public roads and highways and endangering human lives. Further, the reality of the situation is often that a person who drives while disqualified will also not be in possession of a valid third-party insurance policy as required by s 3 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act. Consequently, it was clear to me that the protection of public interest and the need to avoid the tremendous damage and injustice that can arise when members of the public are injured by such irresponsible drivers, mandates the reading of s 43(4) as a strict liability offence. Fourthly, I found it significant that active promotion of the observance of s 43(4) is very much dependent upon personal compliance by the individual since the traffic police are often unable, save in cases where the offender has been stopped for some other offences or on the off-chance when random checks are being conducted, to identify and stop disqualified persons from driving on the roads. Applying the reasoning of this court in _MV Balakrishnan_ (\[9\] _supra_) when construing s 35 of the Traffic Offences Act – a similar offence that deals with driving a class of motor vehicle without the requisite driving licence – the prohibited act is not one which the public can easily protect by its own vigilance. Conversely, it is no great hardship for a person who intends to drive to determine whether or not he is in fact qualified (or disqualified) to do so.

61     In the circumstances, Yong Pung How CJ held (at \[43\]) that a motorist who chose to drive whilst under a disqualification order must expect a term of imprisonment and not merely a fine. Additionally, as the motorist chose to drive in blatant disregard of the law and the authority of the courts, he can and should expect to face the full impact of the law upon him and receive enhanced custodial sentence.

### The accused’s potential for rehabilitation and circumstances surrounding the offences

62     It should be reiterated that s43(4) of the RTA is a strict liability offence as an offender would know that he has unequivocally been disqualified by the courts from driving a vehicle. The culpability of the accused would then have to be considered based on the factors as stated in _Saiful_.

#### Knowledge of the disqualification order

63     It was evident that the accused had actual knowledge of his driving under a disqualification order imposed by the court on 30 May 2019 for drink driving and inconsiderate driving. On that occasion, the accused had pleaded guilty in court for the said offences, which were committed by the accused on 23 March 2017. He was sentenced accordingly to a global fine of $3,000 and a DQAC of 23 months with effect from 30 May 2019 to 29 April 2021. This was in any event acknowledged by the Defence.

64     Yet, despite that, the accused failed to deliver up his driving licence to the TP within seven days of the order of disqualification, which is in contravention of s 44(3) of the RTA.

#### Length of time from expiry of original disqualification order

65     I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had committed the offence of driving whilst under a disqualification order after having served only about 25% of the original disqualification period. The accused was caught driving about six months after the original disqualification order of 23 months DQAC was imposed.

66     This suggested a greater culpability on the part of the accused given his blatant disregard for the law by refusing to comply with the penalties imposed by the court soon after the disqualification order was meted out: See \[33\] of _Saiful_.

67     I therefore agreed with the Prosecution that the accused adopted a callous attitude and was indifferent about the nature and seriousness of his earlier offence of drink driving which even resulted in an accident. He was unremorseful. This appositely indicated to me that his potential or prospects for rehabilitation was not good.

68     On top of that, the accused continued to keep the motorcar and left the car key at home. This was even though he failed to renew the road tax of his motorcar and it expired on 11 November 2019. Perhaps, the accused failed to renew the road tax of the motorcar because he knew that he was disqualified from driving any vehicle.

69     Following from there, the accused plainly knew or at the very least ought to have known that without renewing the road tax, he could not use or drive the motorcar on the roads. By not renewing the road tax, there would similarly not be a valid motor insurance policy in force for the motorcar. Yet, despite that, he decided to take the risk and drove the motorcar on 27 November 2019 in any event.

70     Thus, the culpability of the accused could not be said to have been low as suggested by the Defence in this case given the aggravating factors pointed out.

#### Intentional and flagrant breaking of the law

71     On the facts, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was an intentional and flagrant disregard of the court order by the accused. Whilst the Defence admitted that the accused had intentionally broken the law when he drove under a disqualification order, the Defence sought to persuade the court that the accused had compelling reasons to break the law given the circumstances and the accused’s mental state of mind at the material time.

72     I disagreed with the Defence that there were compelling reasons for the accused to break the law when he committed the offence. I will discuss this below when dealing with the reasons and circumstances where the accused said he felt compelled due to his impulsivity by the weight of the surrounding circumstances to drive under a disqualification order.

#### The accused’s mental state of mind at the material time and weight of the surrounding circumstances

73     First, there was no medical emergency or any emergency whatsoever. This was conceded by the Defence. The sense of urgency was seemingly only felt by the accused.

74     The accused was already late for work that day when he received the phone call from his ex-wife (then wife) as conceded by him in mitigation. His ex-wife did not ask him to go to his in-laws’ home to pass her the folic acid at work immediately. Even if the accused was completely ignorant and did not know whether his ex-wife had needed an important medication or simply vitamins, there was no rush as, if at all, she had asked him if he could do so during lunchtime. Something that is urgent must be compelling and require immediate attention. There was evidently no urgency of any nature other than the fact that the accused was already late for work that day.

75     Moreover, the accused had informed Dr Ung at \[14\] of his medical report that he knew that his wife had forgotten her folic acid vitamins. Folic acid is not a prescribed medication but a vitamin that is readily available and can be bought off-the-shelf at any pharmacy. Even if the accused had wanted to “do this for her” as he said due to her miscarriage about 3 months ago in August 2019 and he did not have the time to go to his in-laws’ home before lunchtime, he could have purchased the folic acid at a nearby pharmacy and pass them to her during lunchtime.

76     Fundamentally, when the accused was caught driving at about 9.49am that fateful morning on 27 November 2019 along CTE, the accused was rushing to work because he was already late for work. Despite that, he said drove from his home in Bedok to the home of his in-laws in Ang Mo Kio before driving to work at Union Security Services Pte Ltd. His workplace is located at the Paya Lebar area. Presumably, if not for the fact that he was caught driving on his way to work, the accused would have to drive the motorcar home after work.

77     Hence, the accused did not intend to drive a short distance merely to obtain the folic acid vitamins for his ex-wife. He intended to drive quite a substantial distance of about 30km from Bedok to Ang Mo Kio before reaching his workplace just to obtain the vitamins. Additionally, alternative modes of transportation like MRT, taxis and private-hire cars were readily available at nine plus in the morning. There was in any case no evidence before me that the accused had exhausted all avenues before deciding to drive the motorcar.

78     On the contrary, there was evidence that the accused had thought about taking the MRT initially (at \[15\] of Dr Ung’s medical report) but changed his mind because he felt he needed to act quickly to obtain the folic acid and did not consider the consequences.

79     On the whole, I found the accused’s culpability was at least at the higher end of moderate if not high. It was only fortuitous that there was no accident and no harmed was caused as a result of the accused’s decision to drive for a considerable distance that day.

80     Second, in respect of the accused’s medical condition, it was stated in the IMH reported dated 14 July 2020 that he was assessed to be suffering from major depressive disorder and has been treated with anti-depressant medication since 16 December 2019. This was only after, and not prior to, the offences were committed in November 2019 and the accused’s arrest.

81     However, there was nothing in the IMH report that indicated or suggested that the accused had sought medical treatment as a result of his ex-wife’s miscarriage in August 2019.

82     Coincidentally, the accused himself indicated he had only started to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety in or around November 2019 when he started his new job. His ex-wife also confirmed that, in the 13 years that they have known each other, the accused started to be more emotionally volatile in November 2019, especially when he was facing stresses at work. This was just prior to or around the period of the offence date.

83     Hence, his ex-wife’s miscarriage in August 2019 might not have been a reason for his depression. Indeed, it could even have been due to the accused’s arrest and the court case which arose from his offences.

84     Another point to note was that during the review on 14 July 2020, Dr Charles Mak informed that the accused’s mood had improved but he would require continued psychiatric medication and follow-up. Yet, on 10 October 2020, instead of applying to IMH, the accused decided to see Dr Ung at Adam Road Medical Centre for a forensic report. This was even though it was almost one year after the offence date when the accused first saw Dr Ung and Dr Ung was not an appointed psychiatrist as defined under the CPC. Concomitantly, during that time, the accused and his ex-wife were contemplating or already undergoing divorce proceedings.

85     Thus, the surrounding circumstances further suggested that the accused’s mental state of mind at the time of the offences was unrelated to his subsequent depression.

86     Coming to Dr Ung’s medical report, at \[27\], Dr Ung was of the opinion that the accused was suffering from both depressive and anxiety symptoms due to his wife’s miscarriage in August 2019 and these symptoms somehow surfaced when he began his new job in November 2019 and at the time of the offences. Further, these symptoms fulfilled the criteria of Major Depressive Disorder (at \[30\]).

87     What is pertinent to note is that Dr Ung said at \[33\] that there was a causal link between the accused’s state of depression and anxiety with his poor judgment or decision-making process as well as increased impulsivity. It was the accused’s _poor judgment or increased impulsivity_ that contributed to the offending behaviour (emphasis added).

88     Therefore, this was clearly different and distinct from saying that the psychiatric condition of the offender is one of the contributing factors for committing the offence. There was no causal link between his psychiatric condition and the commission of the offences. At \[34\] of Dr Ung’s report, he reiterated that it was the accused’s poor decision-making process as well as increased impulsivity that led up to the accused committing the offences.

89     At \[36\], Dr Ung elaborated that the accused could have chosen an alternative means of transportation, but the accused might have acted more impulsively in his choice due to his depressed state and his need to protect his ex-wife. Finally, at \[36\] and \[37\], Dr Ung concluded that the accused was not of unsound mind during the offences and none of these absolved the accused of his culpability in committing the said offences.

90     Following from there, this affirmed my view that the depression or mental illness of the accused was not one of the contributing factors for the accused committing the present offences or his mental state of mind at the material time. This was having regard to the surrounding circumstances, the nature of the offences and the character of the accused.

91     Unlike in _GCX_ where the accused’s mental illness had substantially contributed to his commission of the offence of causing hurt to his ex-wife in the course of a family dispute, here, it was the accused’s poor decision-making process and impulsivity which contributed to the accused’s decision to drive the motorcar on public roads when he knew that he was disqualified from doing since as this was a strict liability offence. There was a conscious choice on the part of the accused to commit the offence.

92     Invariably, an offender who chooses to defy a court order by driving would typically have made a poor judgment call to do so or have done it on impulse or on the spur of the moment e.g. being late for work. Otherwise, the offender would choose to comply with the court order. Such reasons or excuses should not be permissible to condone the commission of this offence by risk takers as there is a public policy reason to protect the public and other road users. As emphasized in _Pavel_, such an offender is akin to being “a lethal and unguided missile as well menace on the roads”.

93     Furthermore, such offences are difficult to detect. If not for the attentiveness of the LTA enforcement officer at the material time, the accused would have continued to drive to work and thereafter home. All in all, the sentencing principles of deterrence, retribution and prevention clearly outweigh the prospect of rehabilitation in this instance.

94     The element of general deterrence may still be accorded full weight in circumstances, such as where the mental disorder is not serious or is not casually related to the commission of the offence, and the offence is a serious one. Specific deterrence may remain relevant too, in spite of the existence of a mental disorder, where the offence is premeditated or where there is a conscious choice to commit the offence: See the relevant principles, particularly (c) and (d) in sentencing an offender with a mental disorder falling short of unsoundness of mind as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Lim Ghim Peow v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 4 SLR 1287</span> and summarised by the High Court in _PP v Chong Hou En_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 3 SLR 222</span> at \[24\] and endorsed by the Court of Appeal in _PP v Kong Peng Yee_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 295</span> at \[59\].

95     All things considered, I agreed with the Prosecution that both general and specific deterrence is warranted in the accused’s case given that he continued to have a poor decision-making process despite his last traffic conviction. The accused’s decision to drink and drive back in March 2017, which was by no means a minor offence, was certainly a bad judgment call.

96     In any event, I was not persuaded that there was a real prospect of rehabilitation in the accused’s case. In the circumstances, I declined to call for a MTO suitability report.

### The most appropriate sentence to impose on the accused in the circumstances

97     Once again, the Defence did not submit any authority to support its position on sentence for a high fine in respect of the offence of driving whilst under a disqualification order.

98     As for the Prosecution’s submission, I agreed that even prior to the amendments to s 43(4) of the RTA on 1 November 2019, the usual benchmark sentence for driving under a disqualification order was already four to eight weeks’ imprisonment for a first offender as held by the High Court in _Fam Shey Yee_ at \[12\]:

>     It is also not disputed that the sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment meted out in the present case falls within the usual tariff of _four to eight weeks’ imprisonment_: see, _eg_, _Public Prosecutor v Tan Chen Chey_ <span class="citation">\[2009\] SGDC 485</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Choo Puay Lan_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 64</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Fazil bin Azman_ <span class="citation">\[2010\] SGDC 168</span>; _Public Prosecutor v Lian Chee Yeow Michael_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 190</span>; and _Public Prosecutor v Tan Thiam Soon_ <span class="citation">\[2011\] SGDC 228</span>. \[emphasis added\]

99     With the 2019 amendments to the RTA, I agreed with the Prosecution that in order to utilise the full range of sentences prescribed by Parliament as per the High Court’s decision of _Poh Boon_ Kiat, the new starting point sentence for a first offender like the accused here would now be double that of the previous sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment, i.e. eight weeks’ imprisonment.

100    I have considered the mitigating factors raised by the Defence including the accused’s contriteness by pleading guilty at the earliest available opportunity and his full cooperation rendered to the police after his arrest.

101    As per my reasons above and having reviewed the circumstances as a whole, I was satisfied that the duration of the custodial sentence at the revised starting point sentence of eight weeks’ imprisonment under the new s 43(4)(a) of the RTA for a first offender was justified. As such, I agreed with the Prosecution and sentenced the accused to the same accordingly.

102    In my view, the accused had flagrantly disregarded the law when he drove while under the disqualification order. Added to that, the accused did not renew the road tax of his motorcar because he knew that he could not drive it.

103    Another fact to note is that although the accused should have returned his driving licence to the TP by the first half of June 2019, he did not do so and never did. At that time, his ex-wife was still not pregnant. Based on his ex-wife medical memo from KKH, she was discovered to be pregnant only after her last menstrual period on 30 June 2019 (see page 2 of the memo). It might be inferred that the accused had no intention to give up his driving licence in spite of the court order on 30 May 2019. From his actions, the accused appreciated the nature, quality and full extent of his actions.

104    As for the disqualification order, I imposed a period of 42 months’ DQAC with effect from date of release from prison on the accused. In doing so, I did take into account the fact that he had committed this offence quite soon after the first disqualification order of 23 months was imposed for drink driving. Once again, I agreed with the Prosecution that there was a need for both general and specific deterrence in this regard to keep the accused off the roads.

105    As regards the driving a vehicle without a policy of insurance in force charge under s 3(1) of the MVA, I was in general agreement with the Defence that, based on the three cases cited i.e. _Mohd Riduan, Prathib_ and _Saimonn_, the typical fine range for a first offender is $500 to $700 with the mandatory minimum disqualification period of 12 months. Accordingly, for this charge, I sentenced the accused to a fine of $600, in default 2 days’ imprisonment and a DQAC of 12 months with effect from the date of conviction.

106    Lastly, for the using a vehicle without a valid road tax in force charge under s 29(1) of the RTA, I imposed a fine of $600, in default 2 days’ imprisonment. This was within the usual fine tariff for this offence.

## Conclusion
