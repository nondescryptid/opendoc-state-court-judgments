## Statement of Facts

3       The Accused admitted without qualification to the following facts:

> The Accused and the co-accused persons

> 1.    The Accused is Ng Gim Hui, Amy.

> 2.    The co-accused persons are :

>> (a)    Sri Ranjit Kanaseng (“Ranjit”), a 31-year-old male Malaysian;

>> (b)    Nur Diana Binte Abdul Rashid (“Diana”), a 35-year-old female Singaporean; and

>> (c)    Mohamed Rafi Bin Mohamed Salleh (“Rafi”), a 38-yer-old male Singaporean.

> Background and Arrest

> 3.    On 23 May 2018 at or about 5.25 pm, following an intelligence briefing earlier that day, a team officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) officers intercepted a black car bearing licence plate no. SJL8298Z (the “Car”) on the extreme left lane along Jurong Gateway Road, before the slip road leading to Toh Guan Road. The accused was the driver of the Car.

> 4.    From the Car, the following exhibits, amongst others, were seized :

>> (a)    one block of vegetable matter (subsequently marked “E1B1”), which was found on the front passenger seat;

>> (b)    one packet of crystalline substance (subsequently marked “F1B2A”, which was found on the floorboard of the front passenger seat; and

>> (c)    another packet of crystalline substance (subsequently marked as “F1B3”, which was also found on the floorboard of the front passenger seat.

> 6.    Investigations revealed that on 22 May 2018, Rafi had called the Accused to assist him to deliver ‘weed’ (the street name for cannabis) to someone whom he claimed was his sister in Singapore, and who was later established to be Diana. The Accused did not know Rafi, but had previously made deliveries for one ‘Zai’ and, when Rafi called, she could hear ‘Zai’ talking in the background.

> 7.    On 23 May 2018, the accused drove to Ng Teng Fong Hospital in the Car as arranged and parked at the basement carpark. The Accused had been informed by one ‘Ah Boy’ that someone would meet her there. Before reaching the basement carpark, Rafi had messaged her an address purportedly belonging to his sister. The given address was Blk 419 Bedok North St 1 #XXX. The accused was instructed to deliver the ‘weed’ to this address.

> 8.    While the Accused was at the basement carpark, ‘Ah Boy’ contacted her and said that his ‘man’ was looking for her. She gave ‘Ah Boy’ the Car’s license plate number and the colour of the Car. At the same time, she noticed there was an Indian male, who was later established to be Ranjit, walking around the carpark. Ranjit, who was not carrying anything at that time, later approached her and told her to park the Car at the other side of the carpark as there was a CCTV camera where the Car had been parked. The Accused did as instructed by Ranjit.

> 9.    Ranjit reappeared around 5 minutes later and placed an orange sling bag on the floor mat of the Car by reaching through the window of the front passenger seat, which had been wound down at that time. The Accused opened the orange sling bag and saw a black bundle. She removed the black bundle from the sling bag and placed it into her own bag which was on the front passenger seat. Thereafter, she took the envelope containing cash and placed it inside the orange sling bag, which Ranjit removed through the same window and he then walked away

## Mitigation Plea

7       Let me first set out the mitigation plea made by the Accused’s counsel.

### The Accused’s family and personal background

8       The Accused is a divorcee with two young children – 11 and 12 years old. The Accused’s children are under the care and control of her ex-husband’s parents, but the Accused has been granted regular access to her children. The Accused has been voluntarily contributing a monthly sum of $600 towards her children’s maintenance. Due to her incarceration for her presence offences, she has told her mother to lie to her children that she would be working in China to cover up for her absence.

9       Counsel submitted that the Accused has had a difficult childhood where she was constantly abused physically by her father through beating with an iron rod; banging her head against the wall; and burning her thigh with a hot iron. The Accused’s father would also make death threats against her and her mother. Despite such abuses, the Accused did not receive care and support from her mother. This was because her mother was the sole breadwinner of the house, and she had to work three to four odd jobs to raise the family.

10     The Accused’s father was a serial drug addict who would make the Accused purchase, collect and deliver controlled drugs to feed his addiction. The Accused was caught by her school’s teachers collecting “protection money” from her schoolmates for her father to feed his drug addiction. She then dropped out of school after only having completed Secondary One. The Accused’s exposure to controlled drugs soon led to her own addiction.

11     The Accused has a short marriage lasting four years. The marriage broke down because of her husband’s infidelity and other vices such as gambling, alcohol addiction and prostitution. The Accused was also physically abused by her husband to the extent that she had contemplated suicide once. She resigned from her work despite being a good employee and has even won a Singapore Service Excellence Award. The Accused’s life was thrown into further chaos by her divorce.

12     The Accused subsequently had another partner and went on to have a child with the said partner. The child was put up for adoption after her partner was imprisoned for drug offences and the Accused could not afford to raise the child on her own.

13     The Accused does not have any form of mental illness, but she has a history of abusing several psychoactive substances excepting alcohol. The Defence submitted that the Accused was suffering from depression after her divorce. Her mental condition worsened from 2017 and it was at its worst in 2018. At times, the Accused would go without sleep for up to four days. The Accused would often talk to herself. She would be easily angered and get frustrated. She would binge on food and then throw them out. Alternatively, she would smash items to release her frustration.

### The Accused’s role in the commission of the Trafficking charge

14     The Defence submitted that the Accused’s culpability is relatively low. Her role was simply a courier, and this would put her at the end of the spectrum as she had only performed a limited function under the directions of the other co-accused who were the actual masterminds and were actively directing or organising the drug transaction on a large a scale.

15     The Accused has co-operated with the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) in their investigations. Her co-operation has led to the arrest of Diana.

## First Issue – Sentencing guidelines for Unauthorised Trafficking in Cannabis

### Prosecution’s submission – to follow established sentencing guidelines

16     The Prosecution urged the court to apply the sentencing framework of _Suventher Shanmugam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 115</span> (“_Suventher_”) and _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”).

17     In _Suventher_, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) held at \[21\] that :

> The sentence passed for any crime should be proportional to the gravity of the offence. Where the offence concerns the trafficking or importation of drugs, the gravity of the offence is measured by the quantity of drugs involved. The sentence imposed should thus be proportional to the quantity of drugs in the offender’s possession. … The quantity of drugs (measured in terms of net weight) that has been trafficked would have a direct correlation with the degree of harm to society. Accordingly, quantity serves as a reliable indicator of the seriousness of the offence.

18     In _Suventher_, the amount of controlled drug involved was not less than 499.9 grams of cannabis. The CA provided the indicative starting sentence guidelines to be applied to the unauthorised import or trafficking of between 330 – 500 grams of cannabis.

19     In the present case, the Trafficking charge involves 289.5 grams of cannabis. The Prosecution thus referred me to the case of _Public Prosecutor v Sivasangaran s/o Sivaperumal_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGDC 214</span> (“_Sivasangaran_”), which case was considered by _Suventher_ at \[28\]. In _Sivasangaran_, the indicative starting sentence guidelines for the unauthorised import or trafficking of between 0 – 330 grams of cannabis are as follows :

20     The indicative starting sentence is only the first step. In _Suventher_, the CA went on to state at \[30\] :

> The indicative sentences are starting points for arriving at an appropriate sentence and should obviously not be applied mechanistically without regard for the precise circumstances in each case. The indicative sentences seek to make the punishment fit the crime but it is of course equally important to ensure that the punishment fits the offender too. Thus, as mentioned in _Vasentha_ (at \[48\]), the indicative starting sentence may be adjusted upward or downward to take into account the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. It is possible, of course, that such upward or downward adjustments could result in the eventual sentence being outside the range of sentences. Where an accused cannot be caned because of gender or of age, the court should also consider the option of imposing a term of imprisonment of not more than 12 months in lieu of caning (see s 325(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).

21     The second step of the sentencing framework is to consider the offender’s culpability and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors, and then adjust the indicative starting sentence upwards or downwards accordingly.

### Defence’s proposal for a new sentencing guideline for Unauthorised Trafficking in Cannabis

22     The Defence submitted that recent judicial development in the case of _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span> (“_Katty_”) have “raised and casted substantial doubts on the accuracy and/or correctness of the decision in _Vasentha_”. (See the Defence’s written _“Mitigation and Submission on Sentence”_ at \[25\]).

23     In _Katty_, Justice Chan Seng Onn held the view that the sentencing framework in _Public Prosecutor v Lai Teck Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 852</span> (“_Lai Teck Guan_”) ought not to apply _in its entirely_ because there are three errors in the sentencing framework. The three errors are : (i) discontinuity in the sentencing range (“the gap problem”); (ii) exceeding the statutory maximum (“the statutory maximum problem”); and (iii) inconsistencies in the gradient (“the inconsistency problem”). Although the decision in _Katty_ did not seek to overrule the decision in _Lai Teck Guan_, it has nonetheless modified _Lai Teck Guan’s_ sentencing guidelines for trafficking in diamorphine.

24     The Defence argued that this would be an opportune time to re-visit the sentencing guidelines for trafficking in cannabis. The Defence thus proposed a new sentencing framework (see the Defence’s written _“Mitigation and Submission on Sentence”_ at \[28\]).

### Court’s decision on sentencing guidelines for Unauthorised Trafficking in Cannabis

25     I rejected the Defence’s submission to draw up a new sentencing framework for the offence of unauthorised trafficking in cannabis. These are my reasons :

> (i)      _Suventher_ is a decision of the CA and it dealt specifically with the offence of unauthorised importation or trafficking of cannabis. _Katty_ and _Lai Teck Guan_ are both decisions of the High Court and neither could be said to have overturned _Suventher_. In my judgement, _Suventher_ remains good law until the CA decides otherwise in a subsequent case.

> (ii)     I was mindful of the caution stated by the Court of Appeal in _Adri Anton Kalangie v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 2 SLR 557</span> (“_Adri Anton Kalangie_”) at \[67\] where the CA stated : “\[r\]elatedly, since the court establishing a new sentencing framework will likely be an appellate court, the doctrine of prospective overruling will likewise most likely arise for consideration by an appellate court. … It would probably be a rare case where a first instance court, whether the High Court sitting in its original criminal jurisdiction or a State Court, has to calibrate a sentencing framework for the first time and must therefore consider the prospectivity of the framework laid down. Such a situation should generally be avoided.” I heeded the CA’s advice. In fact, when I drew the Defence’s attention to _Adri Anton Kalangie_, the Defence immediately dropped its argument on this issue.

> (iii)     The decisions in _Katty_ and _Lai Teck Guan_ dealt with an offender facing sentencing for a repeat offence of unauthorised trafficking in diamorphine. Those case are distinguishable as the Accused was a first time offender for the Trafficking charge and it involves cannabis. In this regard, _Suventher_ and _Sivasangaran_ being decisions that dealt with a first time offender for unauthorised trafficking in cannabis were of greater relevance.

26     In my deliberation on the appropriate sentence for the Trafficking charge, I agreed with the Prosecution that the sentencing guidelines as adopted by the District Court set out in _Sivasangaran_ (see \[19\] above) accorded with the principles in _Suventher_ and were appropriate for application in the present case.

### Application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts of this case

#### Prosecution’s submissions on the Trafficking charge

27     Applying the _Sivasangaran_ sentencing guideline, the Prosecution submitted that the indicative starting sentence is one of 10 to 13 years’ imprisonment and 9 to 10 strokes of caning. During oral argument, the Prosecution stated that it was not seeking additional imprisonment in lieu of caning. As the quantity of drugs involved was 289.5 grams of cannabis, the indicative starting sentence ought to be at the high end of the sentencing band of 10 to 13 years’ imprisonment. However, the Prosecution stopped short of stating a definitive figure.

28     The Prosecution submitted that the Accused’s culpability was low as she was performing a limited function under the co-accused Rafi’s direction. Whilst she has pleaded guilty, it was because she was caught red-handed with the controlled drugs during a CNB operation. The Prosecution also highlighted two other aggravating factors. Firstly, the Accused was caught with different types of controlled drugs. Secondly, the Accused admitted to five other controlled drugs related offences and has given her consent for these five offences to be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes.

29     Finally, the Prosecution submitted that the mitigating factors raised by the Defence were not so exceptional to warrant a sentence for the Trafficking charge to be lower than the sentencing band of 10 – 13 years’ imprisonment.

#### Defence’s submissions on the Trafficking charge

30     After abandoning its proposed new sentencing guidelines, the Defence argued that this court should adopt the modified sentencing guidelines in _Katty_. The Defence relied on a District Court’s decision in _Public Prosecutor v Herman bin Juma’at_ <span class="citation">\[2020\] SGDC 9</span> (“Herman”) which had followed the modified sentencing table in _Lai Teck Guan_. In _Herman_, the Prosecution has submitted to the District Court a modified sentencing guideline based on the decision in Lai Teck Guan (see _Herman_ at \[15\]). For ease of reference, I reproduced the pertinent portion of the modified sentencing guideline from _Herman_ which is relevant to this present case.

31     Based on the above, the Defence placed the indicative starting sentence at 9 years’ imprisonment as the present case involves 289.5 grams of cannabis.

#### Court’s sentencing decision on the Trafficking charge

32     At the outset, I was not minded to follow the sentencing framework in _Herman. Herman_ involves an offender facing a repeat offence of unauthorised trafficking in diamorphine. As such, the District Judge in _Herman_ followed the modified sentencing guidelines of _Katty_ vis-à-vis repeat offending for unauthorised trafficking in diamorphine. The present case concerns a first time offender for unauthorised trafficking in cannabis. The judicial authorities that are of greater relevance are _Suventher_ and _Sivasangaran._ (See \[25(iii)\] and \[26\] above.)

33     I now turn to the appropriate sentence on the Trafficking charge. In accordance with the sentencing framework set out in \[19\] – \[21\] above, the first step is to ascertain the indicative starting sentence based on the quantity of the cannabis involved.

34     As the Trafficking charge involves 289.5 grams of cannabis, the indicative starting sentence, based on _Sivasangaran_, would be within the range of 10 – 13 years’ imprisonment. I agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that the indicative starting sentence should be at the high end of the range. In my judgment, the indicative starting sentence ought to be 12 years’ imprisonment.

35     The next step is to consider whether it is necessary to adjust the sentence according to the culpability of the Accused. In the present case, I found that the Accused bore a relatively low degree of culpability. The Accused’s role was basically that of a courier. There is no evidence to suggest that the Accused was part of a drug syndicate involved in the planning and execution of the supply and delivery network. On this score, both the Prosecution and the Defence were in agreement. In my judgment, it would be appropriate to adjust the indicative starting sentence downwards by a reducing it from 12 years’ imprisonment to 10 years’ imprisonment : see _Vasentha_ at \[79\] and \[80\].

36     Next, I considered whether there is a need to make adjustment for aggravating factors or mitigating factors. The only aggravating factor against the Accused is the TIC charges. The Prosecution has highlighted that the Accused was dabbling in various types of controlled drugs and this is another aggravating factor. Insofar as the Prosecution was referring to the antecedent for unauthorised possession of a controlled drug in 203, this factor is already encapsulated within one of the proceeded charges and one of the TIC charges (see Table B at \[2\] above). These TIC charges would already weigh in favour of an uplift of the indicative starting sentence. In any event, it is not clear how any prior history of controlled drug consumption, which itself already forms the basis for the LT1 Consumption charge, would constitute an aggravating factor for the purpose of a trafficking offence, for which the legislature has provided significant mandatory minimum sentences commensurate with the strong need for deterrence of unauthorised trafficking in controlled drugs.

37     At the other end of the scale, I considered the mitigating factors. The Accused has pleaded guilty and this has saved valuable public resources and time. The Accused has co-operated with the CNB in their investigations which then led to the arrest of Diana. A downward adjustment of the indicative starting sentence was thus warranted.

38     However, I gave no weight to the Defence’s submission on the Accused’s mental state. Whatever mental stress or financial pressure she might be facing then, she has gone into this illegal venture with a clear mind simply to earn more money. The Defence’s submission on the mental state is also at odds with the Accused’s IMH report[^1] which states that it “ _..is highly unlikely that she was in depression during the months preceding her arrest because she was abusing stimulant drugs (Ice) almost every day and she was able to work efficiently following all the complex instructions for drug trafficking and evading the vigilant eye of the law_.”

39     I also gave no weight to the Accused’s personal and family hardship. It is well settled that, except in most exceptional circumstances, hardship to the offender’s family has very little, if any mitigating value : see _Lai Oei Mui Jenny v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1993\] 2 SLR(R) 406</span> (“_Jenny_”), referred to in _Vasentha_ at \[75\]. I did not find the Accused’s personal and family circumstances to be any different from other cases. This is plainly not an exceptional case.

40     In the final analysis, it is my assessment that the upward adjustment for the aggravating factor is fairly balanced by the downward adjustment for the mitigating factors. In the circumstances, no moderation to the indicative starting sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment was needed. I thus imposed a sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment for the Trafficking charge.

## Second Issue – Sentencing for the Enhanced Possession charge and the LT1 Consumption charge

41     In respect of the Enhanced Possession charge, the Accused was liable to enhanced punishment in view of her 2003 criminal conviction for the same offence. The mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law is two years’ imprisonment. The Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of _at least_ two years. The Defence argued that the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment would suffice.

42     In respect of the LT1 Consumption charge, the Accused was liable to enhanced punishment in view of her 2003 criminal conviction for the same offence and her 2011 admission to a DRC. The mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law is five years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane. The Prosecution sought an imprisonment term of _at least_ five years. Again, the Defence argued that the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment would suffice.

43     This was the first occasion in which the Accused’s re-offending for unauthorised consumption and possession of controlled drugs attracted the respective mandatory minimum imprisonment terms. The respective mandatory minimum imprisonments for both offences represented a significant increase when measured against the custodial sentence she has received in 2003. In my assessment, sentencing the Accused to the mandatory minimum imprisonment term for each offence would be sufficient. I therefore imposed a sentence of two years’ imprisonment for the Enhanced Possession charge and a sentence of five years’ imprisonment for the LT1 Consumption charge.

44     In my deliberation on sentence for the Enhanced Possession charge and the LT1 Consumption charge, I did not weigh in the five TIC charges. These five TIC charges were considered for the Trafficking charge. Therefore, there was no double counting on these five TIC charges.

## Third Issue – Whether additional imprisonment in lieu of caning under s 325(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) should be ordered

45     There is another sentencing issue for my consideration with regard to the Trafficking charge and the LT1 Consumption charge. Besides the sentence of imprisonment, the punishment prescribed by law includes mandatory caning for the Trafficking and the LT1 Consumption charges. In brief, 9 to 10 strokes of caning for the Trafficking charge based on the _Sivasangaran_ sentencing guidelines and 3 strokes of caning for the LT1 Consumption charge. In total, 12 to 13 strokes of caning. The Accused is exempt by law from caning : s 325(1)(a) CPC. However, under s 325(2) CPC, the court has the discretion to impose additional imprisonment in lieu of caning. The issue is whether additional imprisonment in lieu of caning under s 325(2) CPC should be ordered for the present case.

46     The Prosecution has categorically stated that it was not seeking the imposition of additional imprisonment in lieu of caning under s 325(2) CPC. The Defence did not address this issue in their written _“Mitigation and Submission on Sentence”_.

47     The appellant in _Vasentha_, like the Accused, is exempt by law from caning under s 325(1)(a) CPC. In _Vasentha_, the appellate court applied the sentencing framework only in respect of the imprisonment aspect of the punishment prescribed by law for the unauthorised trafficking in a controlled drug offence. There was no discussion of the issue of caning and the application of s 325(2) CPC. If I were to follow _Vasentha_ strictly, additional caning in lieu of imprisonment should not be imposed. However, it is not that simple. For further guidance on this issue, I look to the decision in _Amin bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 904</span> (“_Amin_”).

48     In _Amin_, the High Court held that the correct starting point was that an offender’s term of imprisonment should not be enhanced, unless there were good grounds to justify doing so. The courts should not, in general, exercise punitive powers absent sufficient justifications : _Amin_ at \[53\] – \[58\] and \[87\].

49     The relevant factors to be considered are set out in _Amin_ and reproduced below :

> 59    We considered that the following factors may warrant an enhancement of the sentence of an exempted offender:

>> (a)    The need to compensate for the deterrent effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption. ….

>> (b)    The need to compensate for the retributive effect of caning that is lost by reason of the exemption.

>> (c)    The need to maintain parity among co-offenders.

> 60    However, even if these factors are present, as they often will be, that does not necessarily mean that enhancement of the exempted offender’s sentence will be warranted. The court should instead consider the matter holistically and assess whether there are any factors which could militate against the imposition of an additional term of imprisonment. A non-exhaustive list of such factors would include:

>> (a)    medical grounds;

>> (b)    old age;

>> (c)    compassionate grounds;

>> (d)    the need for proportionality; and

>> (e)    parliamentary intention in enacting a sentencing regime for a given offence.

50     In my judgment, the need for deterrence is the dominant sentencing principle in the present case. As such, _Amin_ at \[59(a)\] is most relevant for the present case. In _Amin_, the appellate court added that where the need for deterrence has been identified as the dominant sentence principle, the court should then consider, firstly, whether an additional term of imprisonment was needed to replace the lost deterrent effect of caning, having regard to why the offender was exempted from caning. The key question was whether such potential offenders would have known before committing the offence that by reason of their own circumstances, they would be exempted from caning. In general, an offender who was exempted from caning due to gender is likely to have known that he or she would not be caned. For this class of exempted offenders, an additional term of imprisonment is more readily seen to be called for. Secondly, the court should consider whether an additional term of imprisonment would be effective in replacing the deterrent effect of caning. A key factor in this context was the length of imprisonment that the offence already carried. For example, if an offence carries a long minimum term of imprisonment, it is less likely to be the case that the imposition of additional imprisonment in lieu of caning would likely provide an effective or meaningful deterrent to would be offenders having regard to the sentence already prescribed for the offence. The marginal deterrent value of additional imprisonment would generally diminish in relation to the length of the original contemplated term of imprisonment : _Amin_ at \[65\] – \[69\].

51     In the present case, the number of strokes of caning that the Accused has avoided due to the exemption is between 12 to 13 (see \[45\] above). Based on _Amin’s_ guideline at \[90\], this would translate to a possible additional imprisonment of six to eight months.

52     Having reviewed the principles enunciated in _Amin_, I started with the premise that the Accused’s sentence should not be enhanced unless there were good grounds for it. I found no such grounds on the facts of this case. In addition, on account of the long sentences that were applicable, there was likely to be less of a deterrent effect from any enhancement. For these reasons, I decided not to impose any additional imprisonment term in lieu of caning.

## Fourth Issue – Global Sentence

53     To recap, the individual sentences of imprisonment I have passed are:

> (i)     Trafficking charge – Ten years’ imprisonment

> (ii)     LT1 Consumption charge – Five years’ imprisonment

> (iii)     Enhanced Possession charge – Two years’ imprisonment

54     Pursuant to s 307(1) CPC, I am obliged to order at least two of the three sentences of imprisonment to run consecutively. In this regard, I ordered the terms of imprisonment for the Trafficking charge and the Enhanced Possession charge to run consecutively.

55     I was mindful that my decision on the total sentence must not fall foul of the sentencing principles (_i.e._ the one-transaction rule and the totality principle) laid down by CJ Menon in _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> at \[25\] and \[77\].

## Conclusion

56     For the reasons given above, I meted out the individual sentences as set out in the 3rd column of the Table A at \[2\] above and I ordered the individual sentences for the Trafficking charge and the Enhanced Possession charge to run consecutively. The total aggregate sentence was therefore 12 years’ imprisonment.

57     The Accused was arrested on 23 May 2018 and was kept in custody for investigations. She was charged in court on 25 May 2018 and has been remanded since that day. Exercising the power under s 318(1) CPC read with s 318(5)(a) CPC and s 318(5)(b) CPC, I ordered the term of imprisonment to take effect from 23 May 2018.
