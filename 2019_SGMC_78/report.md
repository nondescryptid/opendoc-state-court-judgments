23 December 2019

### Magistrate Chua Wei Yuan:

1       The accused, Ng Wei Long, (“Mr Ng”) pleaded guilty on the first day of trial to the following charge of unlawful stalking under s 7(1) of the Protection from Harassment Act (Cap 256A, 2015 Rev Ed) (“PHA”):

> You … are charged that you, between 14th March 2017 and 23rd February 2018, did unlawfully stalk \[V\] in Singapore, by engaging in a course of conduct which involved acts associated with stalking that caused harassment to \[V\], which the accused ought reasonably to know that the said course of conduct were likely to cause harassment to \[V\] and you have thereby committed an offence under \[s 7(1) PHA\], punishable under \[s 7(6) PHA\].

> Particulars of the acts associated with unlawful stalking:

>> a)    Sending her sexual explicit messages, a picture of a pair of breasts and a picture of a penis on the Facebook messenger platform;

>> b)    Sending her sexually explicit messages, and a picture of a penis on the Instagram messenger platform;

>> c)    Sending her sexually explicit messages on the Whatsapp messenger platform; and

>> d)    Sending her sexually explicit text messages\[.\]

2       I sentenced Mr Ng to 5 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment. My reasons follow.

## Brief Facts

3       Here, I recount the brief facts based on the Statement of Facts (“SOF”) and its annexes, to which Mr Ng admitted without qualification.

4       On 11 March 2017, Mr Ng (then aged 29) asked to be a friend of the victim (“V”) (then 14 years 4 months old) on Facebook, a social media platform.

5       Immediately after V accepted the request, Mr Ng asked V to be his girlfriend. Between 11 March and 13 March, Mr Ng sent lewd and sexually explicit messages and asked for a variety of sexual favours, even though he knew V to be too young to have sexual intercourse (V disclosed that she was aged 15). Mr Ng also asked V to meet him at a shopping mall—while V agreed on the night of 12 March to meet him the next day, the meeting did not materialise as V changed her mind later. By 13 March, it was clear that V had rejected Mr Ng’s advances, stating that he was too old for her and she did not want a relationship with him or to engage in sexual acts with him. Since then, Mr Ng should reasonably have known that sending V further messages of this sort would have caused her harassment.

6       Nonetheless, on and after 14 March, Mr Ng continued to send V messages and ask for sexual favours (which only got more explicit and depraved); these caused V harassment. The final straw for V came on 20 August 2017, when Mr Ng sent V a picture of a penis; she blocked him on Facebook.

7       However, in February 2018, Mr Ng managed to find out V’s phone number. Between 20 and 23 February 2018, he began calling her, and sending her more sexually explicit messages and requests via text message, WhatsApp messenger, and the Instagram messaging platform.

8       On 24 February 2018, V filed a police report on the advice of a teacher in whom she had confided these matters. This led to Mr Ng’s arrest.

9       Mr Ng sent these messages because he wanted to befriend V and because he felt “horny” thinking about it.

## Preliminary comments on sentencing under s 7 PHA

10     The sentencing of offenders under s 7 of the PHA has been the subject of 3 recent High Court decisions. In chronological order, they are: _Tan Yao Min v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 3 SLR 1134</span> (“_Tan Yao Min_ (HC)”), _Lim Teck Kim v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 99</span> (“_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC)”) and _Sim Kang Wei v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGHC 129</span> (“_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC)”). These decisions are at odds in some ways. Briefly, _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) prescribed a points-based framework that in some ways disagreed with _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) (among other decisions), while _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) explicitly eschewed that framework in favour of reasoning from decided cases, without prescribing an alternative framework.

11     I would have preferred to adjourn sentencing in view of an appeal pending before a 3-judge High Court in which the sentencing framework for this offence might be more definitively ruled upon. However, Mr Ng had been on remand and, on a preliminary view, there had been a risk—which I could not overlook—that such an adjournment would cause Mr Ng’s period of remand to exceed any imprisonment term to which he might be sentenced. Neither was I inclined to relax the terms offered for bail beyond what had been initially offered to Mr Ng, since neither party broached this and, all things equal, he was no less a flight risk (in fact, he had been remanded for a prior failure to attend court). In view of the prejudice to Mr Ng, I sentenced him after a short adjournment to consider the submissions on sentence, this being what I considered to be the least imperfect approach in my circumstances.

## Sentencing submissions

12     The Prosecution submitted that:

> (a)     having regard to the precedents, the appropriate sentence was 8 months’ imprisonment because:

>> (i)       the present case was as aggravated as _Moh Yan Chung_ and _Tan Yao Min_ (HC), where 6 months’ and 8 months’ imprisonment were imposed respectively for the unlawful stalking charge,[^1] as it featured 4 aggravating factors:

>>> (A)       Mr Ng pursued a sexual relationship with V despite knowing that she was a minor;[^2]

>>> (B)       Mr Ng’s conduct was prolonged and extremely persistent;[^3]

>>> (C)       the sexually depraved content of the messages led to V feeling increasingly harassed;[^4] and

>>> (D)       Mr Ng showed little remorse;[^5] and

>> (ii)       the court has imposed at least 5 months’ imprisonment where a minor is involved;[^6] but

> (b)     if the points system were applied, Mr Ng should be sentenced to 3.2 months’ imprisonment (which would, however, be manifestly inadequate given the aggravating facts),[^7] being the sentence recommended for a case with 9 points attributed as follows:

>> (i)       in terms of the offence-specific factors:

>>> (A)       the duration/frequency of stalking should attract 4 out of 5 points for its length and persistence;

>>> (B)       the intrusiveness, which was low, should attract 1 out of 3 points;

>>> (C)       V’s vulnerability as a minor should attract the maximum 3 points by default; and

>>> (D)       V suffered no lasting harm (apart from a fear of being raped by Mr Ng), and this should attract 1 out of 3 points; and

>> (ii)       in terms of offender-specific factors, the guilty plea should merit no discount; and

> (c)     reasoning from precedents was preferable to applying the points system, because:

>> (i)       the points system in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) was problematic;[^8] and

>> (ii)       the court could discern a sentencing pattern from decided cases.[^9]

13     Mr Ng, apart from an oral mitigation, had no submissions on sentence.

## Reasoning

### Part 1: The approaches to sentencing under s 7 PHA

14     Strictly speaking, I do not consider myself bound by either _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) or _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) insofar as there is a conflict because they are equally binding decisions from higher courts of coordinate jurisdiction (_Chan Yat Chun v Sng Jin Chye and another_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] SGHCR 4</span> at \[10\] and _Public Prosecutor v Joseph Chin Saiko_ <span class="citation">\[1972\] 2 MLJ 129</span> (HC, Malaysia) _per_ Lee Hun Hoe J; see also _Lim Quee Choo (suing as co-administratrix of the estate of Koh Jit Meng) and another v David Rasif and another_ <span class="citation">\[2008\] SGHC 36</span> at \[59\]). And, respectfully, I am not fully persuaded by either approach.

#### Concerns with the points system in Lim Teck Kim (HC)

15     In my understanding, _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) essentially posits the following:

> (a)     The sentencing of offenders under s 7 PHA should, in accordance with _Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 449</span> (CA) (“_Terence Ng_ (CA)”), proceed in two stages.

> (b)     At the first stage, the court should have regard to offence-specific factors that relate to both the degree of harm caused and the degree of culpability. To refine the _Terence Ng_ (CA) methodology, there should be a points system, where the sentencing court would assign points to the case at hand depending on its seriousness. In this regard, there are generally 7 offence-specific factors attracting up to 3 or 5 points each. The total points would determine a notional, indicative starting sentence (“first-stage sentence”), as follows:

>> (i)       $1,000 per point, for cases assigned 1–5 points; and

>> (ii)       0.8 months’ imprisonment for every point beyond 5 points, for cases assigned more than 5 points (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[21\] and \[27\]–\[39\]).

> (c)     At the second stage, the court should have regard to and place weight on each offender-specific factor as appropriate in its discretion, and calibrate the sentence to best fit the offender’s circumstances (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[43\]–\[46\]).

16     Many interrelated critiques of the points system were offered by the Prosecution and in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC)—broadly, they could be categorised into those concerning the idea of _a_ points system in general, the _amenability of this offence_ to a points system, and _this_ points system in particular. I thought that the two former categories were not necessarily death knells for a points system (or, at least, a systematic sentencing framework). However, my strongest reservation toward applying the points system in its entirety stemmed from my view that there were still concerns with _this_ points system that could not be immediately and satisfactorily resolved.

##### (1)   Whether points systems in general are problematic

17     The **foremost** category of critiques can be said to be directed at points systems in general. Supposedly, in this regard:

> (a)      _First_, the reason for developing the points system (_ie_, that _Terence Ng_ (CA) has an overt focus on the _number_ of aggravating factors and does not address the issue of _weight_ ascribed to each (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[26\])) is false, since _Terence Ng_ (CA) does require the court to consider _both_ the number of factors and the intensity of each (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[35\]).

> (b)      _Second_, a points system reflects the qualitative exercise of sentencing in quantitative terms (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[44\]).

> (c)      _Third_, the points system contradicts the principle that sentencing is not a formulaic or mechanistic process but a multi-layered determination of what is just in the circumstances (_Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2013\] 4 SLR 1139</span> (“_Edwin s/o Suse Nathen_”) at \[23\]).[^10]

> (d)      _Fourth_, the points system unjustifiably constrains the sentencing judge by fixing the correlation of offence-specific factors to each other, when he should assess the intensity of the aggravating factors qualitatively and holistically (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[39\]).

> (e)      _Fifth_, the court was prone to lose sight of the holistic appreciation of the case, as the points system was likely to lead to comparing points for each factor in different cases, and lead to individual factors being viewed in isolation (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[43\]).

18     As regards the first critique, I generally agreed with how _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) understood _Terence Ng_ (CA). The claim in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) is inconsistent with _Terence Ng_ (CA), which explicitly requires the court to consider the intensity of the aggravating factors (at \[57\] and \[73(b)(iii)\]) and requires the court to “openly and clearly articulate the precise weight” ascribed to each factor (at \[37(b)\]; see also \[73(d)\]). But, these passages also lead me to think that a points system is nonetheless very much in the spirit of _Terence Ng_ (CA).

19     The next of these critiques is not as repugnant as it appears. While sentencing—in particular the weighing of factors—is a qualitative exercise, it is ultimately expressed in parameters that are discontinuous (_ie_, the modality of sentence) and quantitative (_eg_, the quantum of the fine, length of the imprisonment term, or number of strokes of the cane). In other words, it requires what _Terence Ng_ (CA) at \[48\] calls an “exercise in evaluative ethical judgment”. A points system that requires a judge to undertake such an exercise for each factor (as opposed to holistically) brings this exercise one step prior in the analysis (see _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[41\]) and demands (properly, in my view) a more granular consideration of the facts, but does not otherwise add to what is already required. Further, the points system is also candid about the necessity of this exercise.

20     The last three critiques, in my view, can be met with at least three responses.

21      _First_, any sentence recommended by the points system is merely an “indicative starting sentence” (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[27\], \[41\] and \[48\]) or “indicative starting point” (_Terence Ng_ (CA) at \[61\]), and “\[u\]ltimately, each sentence must be calibrated to best fit the accused’s circumstances” (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[46\]). In fact, in a sense a points system already exists for offences with a dominant determinant of sentence (_eg_, trafficking in a type of drug)—in such cases the indicative starting point is typically based on the seriousness of one factor such as the quantity of drugs trafficked (see, _eg_, _Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span> (“_Vasentha_”) at \[47\] _per_ Sundaresh Menon CJ; _Public Prosecutor v Tan Lye Heng_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 564</span> (“_Tan Lye Heng_”) at \[125\] _per_ Steven Chong JA; _Public Prosecutor v Lai Teck Guan_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 5 SLR 852</span> (“_Lai Teck Guan_”) at \[42\] _per_ Menon CJ), and is adjusted to take other factors into account.

22      _Second_, as _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) recognised at \[80\], a framework that allows judges to consider one factor at a time enables a judge to better assess the seriousness of an offence, without being overwhelmed by having to simultaneously consider several offence-specific factors, each of different weights. This also mitigates the risk of double-counting factors.

23      _Third_ (and most fundamentally), these critiques risk suppressing the depth and transparency of judicial reasoning. In sentencing an offender, each relevant factor should be ascribed its proper weight, and the court should state clearly how much weight it ascribed to each factor and why. In this regard, a points system commends itself for its transparency and consistency. If, as was urged upon me in submission, the concern is that a points system is unsuitable because the weight to be ascribed to each factor depends on the facts of the case, then I think it behoves the court to identify and articulate the fundamental and irreducible determinants of a sentence, and the underlying principles on how weight is ascribed to each determinant. If this is not done, there remains the twin dangers of excessive arbitrariness and inconsistency (as _Terence Ng_ (CA) acknowledges at \[37(b)\]): judges might, by appealing to the proposition that sentencing involves a holistic assessment of factors, assign different weights to each factor for reasons that turn out to be different and possibly irreconcilable. In this regard, my point is not so much that a points system prescribes the weight that each factor should receive and, when applied consistently over time, leads to a corpus of transparently-reasoned precedents that will help courts accurately benchmark the seriousness of offences against others of like nature. Rather, the fact that the points system is intended to do so _makes it important_—and thus _can become the impetus_—to identify (and refine, as more cases fall to be decided) the irreducible determinants of a sentence, or the principles that determine the weight to be ascribed to each factor. The closer the court is to identifying these determinants and principles, the more clearly the relationship between the facts and the sentence can be understood and, over time, judges will be increasingly able to impose a sentence that is principled, accurate, and precise.

24     Take, for example, drug offences. It is precisely because the court has closely examined the precedents and the issue of what the relationship between the quantity of the drug trafficked and the sentence ought to be, that a framework can emerge prescribing an indicative sentence (as in _Vasentha_ and _Tan Lye Heng_), and it is because the court has examined the issue of repeat offending closely that a framework can emerge prescribing the indicative enhanced sentences for repeat drug offenders (as in _Lai Teck Guan_). As it turns out, these decisions even though widely followed have their detractors as well. In _Soh Qiu Xia Katty v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] 3 SLR 568</span>—a judgment released shortly after I passed sentence—Chan J disagreed with _Lai Teck Guan_ on a number of aspects of its framework. In the context of enlistment offences, _Public Prosecutor v Chow Chian Yow Joseph Brian_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 335</span> (“_Brian Chow_”) sought in its proposed framework to account for the time spent abroad without an exit permit, the effect of a guilty plea, and the effect of arrest or surrender. This was considered in _Public Prosecutor v Sakthikanesh s/o Chidambaram and other appeals and another matter_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 5 SLR 707</span> (CA), which concluded that the length of period of default should be the principal determinant of sentence (at \[87\]) and prescribed a different set of starting points from _Brian Chow_. And, in the context of corruption, _Ding Si Yang v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 2 SLR 229</span> sought to account for the importance of the transaction sought to be influenced, repeat offences, and guilty pleas in its sentencing framework. From these, I gather two points. First: nothing in principle prevents the court from attempting to articulate a systematic sentencing framework even if there is more than one main determinant of sentence. Second: while some views may be vindicated and others found to be erroneous, the point is that these views receive due focus and rigorous examination rather than be dealt with in broad brushstrokes.

25     In this light, the danger of the critiques by the Prosecution or in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) is that the court may be content with an approach that is ultimately less rigorous and less precise. This does not sit well with what was said and done in _Terence Ng_ (CA), _ie_, a review of the sentencing framework for rape to properly account for the “normative significance” of each factor (see _Terence Ng_ (CA) at \[18\]). Indeed, _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) contained no explicit discussion on the normative importance of each factor, or the weight it placed on each factor and, in this sense, is in my view less satisfactory a decision than _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC).

##### (2)   Whether sentencing under s 7 PHA is amenable to a points system

26     The **next** category of critiques concerns the amenability of this offence to a points system. In this regard, the Prosecution submitted that unlawful stalking, which can encompass myriad factual circumstances, is not amenable to a rigid and mechanistic sentencing framework that ascribes a fixed number of points to each factor.[^11]

27     Apart from my views above, this can be met with two replies.

28      _First_, a points system does not necessarily pigeonhole all the facts into a rigid or mechanistic framework. The points system in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC), for example, accepts that any additional independent offence-specific factors that reflect an offender’s culpability and harm caused to the victim may attract more points (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[34\]). Further, facts which cannot not fit neatly into the framework can be the basis for calibrating the sentence.

29      _Second_ (and more fundamentally), this critique might be turned on its head to suggest that a systematic sentencing framework is precisely necessary to promote consistency in sentencing for offences which can arise from diverse fact patterns. As will become evident, many precedents examined below involve (as in this case) a victim for whom the offender has expressed unreciprocated feelings, while another group of precedents involve stalking motivated by revenge or reprisal (_eg_, _Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nurizam_ (SC-907489-2016) (“_Muhammad Nurizam_”) and _Public Prosecutor v Lee Shing Chan and another_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 38</span> (“_Lee Shing Chan_”)). These may appear unconnected, but some precedents exhibit elements of both (_eg_, _Public Prosecutor v Adrian Goh Guan Kiong_ (SC-902574-2016) (“_Adrian Goh_”) and _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC)). Not consistently applying a systematic sentencing framework across these cases increases the risk of inconsistency, and even perhaps the risk that the inconsistency is discovered later rather than sooner.

##### (3)   Whether this points system is problematic

30     The **final** category of critiques concerns _this_ points system in particular; I will divide those raised by the Prosecution and _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) into 2 sub-categories.

31     The **_former_** sub-category concerns _how the categories are defined_. The Prosecution submitted that the points system appears overly strict: for example, victims appear to be considered vulnerable by reason of age or physical/mental frailty but not the intimacy of or relative weakness in the relationship.[^12]

32     However, I think this concern can be overcome. If a category appears over-inclusive or under-inclusive on its face, a court might in a subsequent case interpret or define it in a way that more faithfully expresses the underlying principle. Thus, if one considers the vulnerability of victims to refer not only to the victim’s (lack of) ability to protect himself/herself from the intrusion (as _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) posits at \[34\]), but also a victim’s state of being that renders him/her more susceptible to intrusive conduct in the first place (as the Prosecution submits), then the court can in that light re-evaluate the correctness of sentences in the precedents examined (such as _Adrian Goh_, _Public Prosecutor v Tan Boon Wah_ (SC-905671-2016) (“_Tan Boon Wah_”) and _Public Prosecutor v Lai Zhi Heng_ (SC-912644-2015) (“_Lai Zhi Heng_”)).

33     The **_latter_** sub-category of critiques relates to _how the points are calculated_. In this regard, two concerns supposedly arise.

34      _First_, the points system fixes the correlation of the highest aggravating weight of one factor to that of another factor, even though it turns on the facts of each case whether one particular factor causes more harm than another (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[37\]–\[38\]).

35     However, as with my comments at \[23\]–\[25\] above, this might simply mean that the court should identify and articulate the underlying principles on how weight is ascribed to each factor or the irreducible determinants of a sentence.

36      _Second_, the points system might cause a mismatch between the seriousness of the case and the sentence. This could happen as the maximum sentence in a case is recommended even though the maximum possible number of points has not been reached (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[40\]–\[42\]) or, as the Prosecution submitted, because the points system caps the points for each factor regardless of its severity.[^13]

37     However, the points system might not be as problematic as it appears, because it might be said to represent what Chan J considered the least problematic compromise available. The concern in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC), on its face, can be addressed by assigning the maximum punishment to what the court envisages to be the maximum possible number of points (_ie_, at least 25 points), instead of 20 points as envisaged in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC). As for the Prosecution’s concern, one might be tempted to address it by removing the limit on the number of points that may be ascribed to each factor. For example, where the duration/frequency of stalking is concerned, the court award points by extrapolation/interpolation on the basis that stalking for a few occasions over a few days to 2 weeks attracts 1 point (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[34\] and \[51\], discussing _Public Prosecutor v Lim Seow Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 44</span> (“_Lim Seow Kiat_”), _Public Prosecutor v Ng Hanwei_ (SC-912985-2016) (“_Ng Hanwei_”), and _Adrian Goh_) while consistent stalking for 1–1.5 years attracts 5 points (_id_, discussing _Tan Boon Wah_, _Lai Zhi Heng_ and _Public Prosecutor v Tan Khoon Aik, Nelson_ (SC-913209-2016) (“_Nelson Tan_”)). Yet, it is difficult to see how both concerns can be fully valid at the same time. If the number of points for each factor is not capped, there is theoretically no limit to the number of points a case can be ascribed (rather unlike the drug trafficking offence in _Vasentha_, where there is an upper limit to the dominant determinant of sentence)—it then becomes impossible to provide _a priori_ for the “worst conceivable” case that would attract the maximum penalty. Accordingly, to fully utilise the range of punishment provided by Parliament, the court _may legitimately_ (and _sometimes must_) judge when a case is _sufficiently_ serious to merit the maximum penalty, even if other cases may turn out to be more serious. In this sense, the objection in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) loses some force. In the final analysis, the real concern seems to be how to accurately calibrate the number of points to be ascribed to each factor at its different levels of severity.

38     Apart from the concern that the points system can cause a mismatch between the seriousness of the case and the sentence, there are some **_other_** concerns I have that made me hesitant to apply the points system fully. They largely relate to the premises or approaches which inform the points system, but for which reasons were not given.

39      _First_, the points system relegates the analysis of the “classic principles” of sentencing (_ie_, retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation) to the second stage (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[46\]). However, it is not necessarily the case that competing sentencing imperatives can be resolved only at that stage, for at least two reasons. First: in some cases, this issue may have to be addressed as a logically prior one on the basis that it can affect the _modality_ of the sentence (_eg_, if rehabilitation takes centre stage) and the _weight_ to be attributed to certain factors (_eg_, if general deterrence takes centre stage) (Kow Keng Siong, _Sentencing Principles in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2nd Ed, 2019) (“Kow Keng Siong”) at Ch 6 generally, but also at paras 06.089 and 06.161 in particular; see also _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[65(b)(i)\]). Second: conceptually speaking, sentencing imperatives do not always arise in situations specific to the offender. For example, the nature or circumstances of the offence may sometimes demand a deterrent sentence.

40      _Second_, under the points system, most factors generally tend to affect the number of points (or sentence) by simple addition, the principal exception being the effect of a guilty plea. It is unclear if this is necessarily true. For example, certain aggravating factors (or combinations thereof) might have an effect a multiplicative (rather than additive) effect on sentence.

41      _Third_, _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[32\] explained _generally_ why some factors must have a greater maximum weight than others, but did not explain _specifically_ the differences in the maximum weights of the relevant factors (apart from how public dissemination of sensitive information/images has greater maximum weight than the use of threats against the victim). Generally, each judge in each precedent examined in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) had the benefit of considering a number of precedents, and must have had a view (even if impliedly) on which factor was more important. Insofar as _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) effectively disagreed with the views in those precedents by considering some outcomes to be too severe/lenient, no reason was offered.

42      _Fourth_, the points system has placed the fine and imprisonment term on the same continuum (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[38\]–\[39\]). This leads to a few implications for which the reasons were neither self-evident nor explained:

> (a)     If the indicative starting sentence for 6 or more points can be extrapolated on a straight-line basis (as appears to be the case), then imprisonment as a modality of sentencing, no matter how short, always appears more serious than the maximum fine. However, it is not clear that this is always true, even as a default position. This concern, taken with that above at \[36\], suggests that even though the points system attempts to justify being more lenient or stricter with less or more serious offending respectively (see _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[57\] _et seq_), it has over-compensated for any supposed congregation of sentences around an anchor. In other words, it might well be that the points system should have recommended a short imprisonment term even for cases below 5 points, and reserve the maximum imprisonment term for cases with over 20 points; and that there should be a range where either a high fine or a low imprisonment term might conceivably be imposed.

> (b)     Each point could (generally) add either a $1,000 fine or 0.8 month’s imprisonment to the sentence. It is not clear how these two increments are commensurate, especially considering that in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) itself the imprisonment term in default of a $5,000 fine was 2 weeks. It might be that each point should (at least) attract a larger increment where a fine is concerned or a smaller increment where an imprisonment term is concerned. Graphically, any correction to the points system on account of these two concerns discussed thus far might be represented as follows:

![]([2019] SGMC 0078_Image/[2019] SGMC 0078_image1.png)

> (c)     More fundamentally, each factor can in one sense equally contribute to the _quantum_ of the sentence as can the _modality_ of the sentence. However, it is not necessarily true that different factors, which might have the same effect on the quantum of the sentence, will have the same influence on the modality of the sentence (_eg_, whether the custodial threshold is crossed). For example, in _Lim Seow Kiat_, the Court appeared to have accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the custodial threshold was not crossed because of the offender’s age, among other things (at \[9\]). Also, in _Public Prosecutor v Lim Teck Kim_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGDC 77</span> at \[19\], the District Judge (“DJ”) held that the custodial threshold was crossed because of the use of threats (as _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) observed at \[77\]) and, essentially, premeditation. While the appellate court disagreed, it did not appear to have offered any reason beyond stating that the custodial threshold was crossed because more than 5 points were ascribed to the case.

> (d)     This points system does not account for when a fine _and_ an imprisonment term will be meted, or how this can be easily accounted for.

> (e)     The discount awarded on the basis of a guilty plea was applied to the recommended _sentence_ rather than the total number of _points_. Thus, a guilty plea on a case rated 5 points would reduce a $5,000 fine to a $3,750 fine (or a 1.25 point discount). On the other hand, a guilty plea on a case rated 9 points would reduce a 3.2-month imprisonment term to a 2.4-month imprisonment term (or a 1 point discount). A corollary of this is that, normatively, a guilty plea ordinarily does not appear to affect the modality of sentence in what might otherwise be considered a borderline case. That is, by this logic, a guilty plea on a case rated 6 points would presumably reduce a 0.8-month imprisonment jail term to 0.6-month imprisonment term instead of a $4,500 fine. It is unclear how these results square with _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[43\], which suggest that the mitigating or aggravating factors may tip the case to a higher or lower sentencing band in borderline cases, or at \[79\], where the “borderline” Band 2 case of 6 points (_ie_, which would merit 0.8 month’s imprisonment) was discounted to the highest end of Band 1 (_ie_, a $5,000 fine) on account of the guilty plea—under such circumstances, it becomes unclear when a short imprisonment term is ever warranted as a starting point.

43     For these reasons, I had a guarded view of this points system and did not think it would be appropriate to apply it wholesale. I turn now to _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC).

#### Concerns with reasoning from precedents only (as in Sim Kang Wei (HC))

44     Although _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) disagreed explicitly with the points system, it did not propose another framework for sentencing offenders. But, it was Chan J’s concerns with the corpus of precedents that led him to propose the points system in the first place. His main charge against reasoning from precedents is that the sentences have largely congregated around 3–6 months’ imprisonment, because judges have reasoned by (insufficiently) adjusting upward/downward from the sentencing trend (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[55\] _et seq_). At the risk of over-simplification, this is essentially a claim of anchoring bias, which reveals inconsistent sentencing practice and offends the principle that the full sentencing range should be utilised (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[67\]–\[72\], citing _Tay Wee Kiat and another v Public Prosecutor and another appeal_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] 4 SLR 1315</span> at \[76\]).

45     The _argument_ in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) is _not as forceful as intended_, as it rests on the points system, the validity/persuasiveness of which has been challenged above. As seen in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[62\]–\[66\], this argument is based on a comparison between, first, the points awarded for offence-specific factors and, second, the notional first-stage sentence, which in turn is computed by adjusting the actual sentence for the supposed effect of offender-specific factors (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[62\]–\[66\]).

46     Nonetheless, this does **_not_** mean that the _conclusion_ in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) is _false_. Unfortunately, _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) did not expressly address the claim in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) either way, except insofar as it could be said to have refuted the conclusion by implicitly accepting that the cases where similar sentences were meted involved offenders of similar overall culpability (see _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[68\]). Ultimately, there might be some truth to the claim in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) if the difference in culpability between two cases is not matched by a commensurate difference in sentence.

> (a)     One example of this (as _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) suggests at \[71\]–\[72\]) is a comparison between _Adrian Goh_ and _Lai Zhi Heng_, where 6 months’ imprisonment was imposed in both cases even though Chan J thought that the sentences should have been 4.2 months’ imprisonment and 11.6 months’ imprisonment respectively. In almost every relevant factor identified, _Lai Zhi Heng_ involved facts that were no less serious than in _Adrian Goh_. In _Lai Zhi Heng_, the stalking unfolded consistently over 1.5 years (as opposed to 4 days), involved threats, entailed the dissemination of compromising photographs to publicly accessible areas (as opposed to closed groups of persons), and led the victim to change schools twice (as opposed to take leave for 10 days). The offender had also demonstrated less remorse, and had a further charge taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing (“TIC charge”). There appear to be only 3 matters that tilt the considerations in the opposite direction: _first_, the fact that the _mens rea_ in the charge in _Adrian Goh_ was different not merely that he _ought reasonably to have known_ that his conduct was likely to cause harassment, but that he _intended_ to cause harassment; _second_, the fact that in _Lai Zhi Heng_ the offender was assessed to have a “mix of schizoid, antisocial and histrionic personality traits” and secondary mild persistent depressive disorder, for which he later took the initiative to seek help; and _third_, the fact that in _Adrian Goh_ the sentence was driven by general deterrence (the Court agreed with the Prosecution’s submission that a stiff sentence should be imposed to deter like-minded would-be offenders).[^14] Unless these 3 matters can fully or substantially offset the factors raised earlier (and I have some doubt that it can), the sentence might have been too lenient in _Lai Zhi Heng_ and/or too harsh in _Adrian Goh_.

> (b)     Another example is the comparison between _Nelson Tan_ and _Ng Hanwei_, where 3 months’ and 5 months’ imprisonment were imposed respectively even though Chan J thought that the sentence should have been 6 months’ and 2 months’ imprisonment instead. _Nelson Tan_ was more serious in terms of frequency/duration (_ie_, consistent stalking over 1.5 years, as opposed to 3 occasions over 1.5 weeks), issuance of threats, involvement of third parties (_ie_, the victim’s boyfriend), and causing of extraordinary harm. 3 matters appear to tilt the considerations in the opposite direction: _first_, the fact that the _mens rea_ in _Ng Hanwei_ was an intent to cause harassment; _second_, the fact that the victim in _Ng Hanwei_ was vulnerable; and _third_, the offender in _Ng Hanwei_ had 3 series of relevant antecedents. Unless they can account for the result, the claim of inconsistent sentencing in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) might be vindicated. In particular, I note that, based on court records, _Ng Hanwei_ (which was decided earlier) was not raised for consideration in _Nelson Tan_.

> (c)     A third example is the comparison between _Ng Hanwei_ and _Tan Yao Min_ (HC), where 5 months’ and 8 months’ imprisonment were imposed respectively (_ie_, a 3-month or 67% difference) even though Chan J thought that the sentence should instead have been 2 months’ and 6.9 months’ imprisonment (_ie_, a 4.9-month or 245% difference). Although the victim in _Ng Hanwei_ was marginally younger and the offender had a graver _mens rea_, the stalking in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) was more serious in virtually every other aspect—it happened frequently over nearly 1.5 months (as opposed to 3 incidents on either end of 12 days); it extended to third parties; the offender’s antecedents were more serious (in that they involved the same victim); the victim suffered “severe trauma and distress” and had to resort to numerous self-help measures; and her next-of-kin suffered alarm as well (_Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[90\]–\[91\] and \[102\]). In fairness, the sentence in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) might have been higher but for adjustments on the basis of the totality principle: at first instance, the sentence was said to have been “calibrated” (_Public Prosecutor v Tan Yao Min_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 167</span> at \[37\]) and, on appeal, the court strictly speaking decided only that the sentence was _not_ manifestly _excessive_ (_Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[92\]) and, when defending the sentence by reference to _Ng Hanwei_, did not seem to think it necessary to rely on the fact that the victim (and her next-of-kin) had to resort to self-help and suffered harm (_Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[91\]; _cf_ \[102\]). But, even so, one might query if the difference between the sentences adequately accounts for the difference in the offenders’ culpability.

47     On the basis of my concerns above at \[23\]–\[25\] and \[46\], I also had a guarded view of reasoning purely from the precedents.

#### The real disagreement

48     The cases appear to agree, even if implicitly, that the importance of each factor is determined by norms beyond what is found in the precedents. This is most apparent in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC): Chan J could _not_ have derived the importance of each factor (as appears in the points system) from the precedents, because he tested each precedent against the points system and effectively concluded that the sentences in some of them were too severe or lenient. In other words, the points system, to him, was the more objective measure. While the judges in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) and _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) appeared content with the precedents cited to them, they could only have made sense of those precedents and reason how the case at hand was different by having a view of the normative importance of each factor in the first place (see _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[90\]–\[91\] and _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[64\]–\[65\]).

49     The real disagreement between the cases, in my view, is the importance of each sentencing factor. In this sense, _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC), despite eschewing the points system, still competes on this same normative plane as _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC). This disagreement is **_normative_** rather than _empirical_ (in the sense that it cannot be fully resolved by attempting to distil principles from the precedents), and is **_logically prior_** to the question of whether the cases reflect a sentencing trend as it ought to be. If I applied either approach unquestioningly, I would not know if the differences in the cases were penumbral or pivotal, and I cannot know if my sentence is well-founded in principle. To illustrate my point, I can do no better than to refer to the example in Ronald Dworkin, _Law’s Empire_ (Hart Publishing, 2003) at pp 41–42:

> … between two kinds of disagreements, the distinction between borderline cases and testing or pivotal cases … We can see the difference by imagining two arguments among art critics about whether photography should be considered a form or branch of art. They might agree about exactly the ways in which photography is like and unlike activities they all recognize as “standard” uncontroversial examples of art like painting and sculpture. They might agree that photography is not fully or centrally an art form in the way these other activities are; they might agree, that is, that photography is at most a borderline case of an art. Then they would probably also agree that the decision whether to place photography within or outside that category is finally arbitrary, that it should be taken one way or another for convenience or ease of exposition, but that there is otherwise no genuine issue to debate whether photography is “really” an art. Now consider an entirely different kind of debate. One group argues that (whatever others think) photography is a central example of an art form, that any other view would show a deep misunderstanding of the essential nature of art. The other takes the contrary position that any sound understanding of the character of art shows photography to fall wholly outside it, that photographic techniques are deeply alien to the aims of art. _It would be quite wrong in these circumstances to describe the argument as one over where some borderline should be drawn._ **_The argument would be about what art, properly understood, really is_**_; it would reveal that the two groups had very different ideas about why even standard art forms they both recognize—painting and sculpture—can claim that title._

> \[emphasis added\]

50     For these reasons, I could not readily accept the Prosecution’s submission that I could discern a sentencing trend from the existing cases. And, with this in mind, I turn to analyse, in the next 3 sections, what I think the sentence in this case should be. I will, _first_, state my views on what I took into account as regards each offence- or offender-specific factor that I found relevant and material to sentencing and, _second_, compare Mr Ng’s criminality to that of the offenders in the precedents of which I was aware. These two sections will be _preceded_ by a section where I state some views on the relative normative importance of some of these factors in the light of the disagreements in the cases—this is intended to place my analyses (based on the points system and the precedents) in perspective.

### Part 2: Some views on the relative normative importance of factors

51     In sentencing offenders under s 7 PHA, I consider _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) to have posited the following:

> (a)     Two factors—**(1)** duration/frequency of stalking and **(2)** public dissemination of sensitive material—are normatively more important than the other factors (_ie_, **(3)** intrusiveness, **(4)** vulnerability of the victim, **(5)** use of threats, **(6)** involvement of third parties, and **(7)** causing of extraordinary harm). This is because they were allowed a maximum of 5 points (as opposed to 3 points for the other factors).

> (b)     Antecedents warranted an uplift from the first-stage sentence, although their potential significance is supposedly a matter for the court’s discretion (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[43\]) and, presumably for this reason, was not definitively stated. Nonetheless, a comparison of _Public Prosecutor v Lim Seow Kiat_ <span class="citation">\[2018\] SGMC 44</span> (“_Lim Seow Kiat_”) and _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) against _Ng Hanwei_ suggests that it is more aggravating to have antecedents against the same victim than to have more antecedents (something which _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[90\] appears to agree with). Empirically, the presence of antecedents (barring those which attract enhanced penalties under s 8 PHA) has attracted up to a 2.5-point increase in sentence:

> (c)     An unexceptional guilty plea appears to attract a 25% discount from the indicative starting sentence (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[45(a)\]). However, apart from my comments above at \[42(c)\], this claim appears to be at odds with _Terence Ng_ (CA) at \[71\] and _Chang Kar Meng v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] 2 SLR 68</span> (CA) at \[71\], both of which disapproved of an even more general proposition that a plea of guilt that is timely and evidences contrition can attract a one-quarter to one-third discount off an otherwise appropriate sentence.

52     On the level of principle, I did not agree fully with all the above propositions. I also considered some relevant factors to have been omitted. I will engage a few matters which seemed most obvious to me and material to how the precedents should be understood.

#### Intrusiveness of stalking

53      **First**, in my view, normatively speaking, the intrusiveness of the stalking is not an entirely independent factor. Specifically, contrary to what _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) posited at \[30(b)\] at \[34\], stalking by electronic means is not necessarily less intrusive. Instead, the true principle appears to be whether the mode of stalking was exploited for the harms with which it is associated.

54      **_Empirically_**, I think _Adrian Goh_ and _Public Prosecutor v Sim Kang Wei_ <span class="citation">\[2019\] SGMC 4</span> (“_Sim Kang Wei_”) disagrees with _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) on what to make of the mode of stalking. In _Adrian Goh_, the fact that the stalking was done through electronic means demonstrated the _ease_ of disseminating compromising material and became the reason for imposing a sentence driven by general deterrence. Similar sentiments were expressed in _Sim Kang Wei_, where the DJ noted the following at \[51\] (which received no adverse comment from the High Court even though it allowed the defence’s appeal):

> 51    I move on to address a disturbing feature of this case. In today’s twenty-first century world, the presence of the Internet is ubiquitous. Further, I have noted that the deliberate abuse of online social media has been conspicuously evident in almost every facet of this case. There is also a palpable sense that the rise of the Internet affords more opportunities for stalkers, as they can pursue their insidious activities from the comfort and safety of their own home. The Internet also affords protection and anonymity for their disruptive actions. The vast amounts of information available on social media, gives greater access to valuable personal information and passwords, which a stalker can use to advance his nefarious purposes. A clear signal must therefore be sent by the courts that such abuse of the Internet and social media in Singapore where digital penetration and Internet usage is high, will be swiftly discouraged by deterrent sentences imposed in the public interest. No Internet user in Singapore should ever have to fear harassment by a stalker who has weaponized the Internet to make surreptitious attacks on vulnerable victims.

55     As a matter of **_principle_**, I think the view in _Adrian Goh_ and _Sim Kang Wei_ is preferable to the view in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC). While electronic stalking might in some cases reduce the intrusiveness felt by the victim, it can in other cases be exploited to provide anonymity, or to increase the duration or magnitude of harm (_eg_, when compromising material is disseminated). And, even if stalking by electronic means is less intrusive, there is a **_policy_** argument for nonetheless treating such cases with some firmness: the prevalence of electronic stalking may also make deterrence a more forceful sentencing consideration. This issue was also highlighted by the Minister in his Second Reading speech for the Protection from Harassment Bill (_Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report_ (13 March 2014) vol 91 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)) (“PHB Second Reading Speech”):

> Harassment can take place in the physical space and in the online space. Cyber-space makes harassment easier, and in some ways, more egregious, because it can be anonymous, borderless, viral and permanent.

> Late last year, REACH commissioned a study involving more than 1,000 Singapore residents above the age of 15. More than 80% of those surveyed felt online harassment to be a serious issue. The survey had a margin of error of 3%. \[The Minister went on to recount examples of online harassment.\]

> ...

> Bullying amongst our youth is also a serious issue … a recent Microsoft Study surveyed 25 countries on the issue of bullying amongst youth aged eight to 17. According to the study, 86% of those surveyed worldwide had experienced bullying online, offline or both.

> The situation in Singapore is unfortunately reflective of the global trend. Eighty-three percent of youths in Singapore aged eight to 17 have been bullied either online, offline or both. Unfortunately, Singapore was also found to have the second highest rate of online bullying of youth at 58%, behind only China at 70%.

> The Straits Times ran a report last month highlighting that our children are particularly vulnerable to cyber risks. According to the report, more than eight out of 10 households are connected to the Internet. Activities such as web-surfing, chatting online and posting on social media networks have become common place especially for our young. With these come the increased risks of cyber bullying, whether as a bully or as a victim.

56     It is not entirely clear if _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) intended for courts to express opprobrium towards the conduct of those like the offender in _Adrian Goh_ only by ascribing points to the factor of extraordinary harm. In my view, such an analysis would be unsatisfactory because harm, however extraordinary, is _victim_\-centric, whereas the principle in _Adrian Goh_ and _Sim Kang Wei_—the exploitation of the harmful potential—is _offender_\-centric.

#### Victim’s vulnerability

57      **Second**, as alluded to above at \[32\], I agree with the Prosecution that a victim can be considered vulnerable not only if he/she is unable to protect himself/herself from the intrusion, but also if his/her state of being makes him/her more susceptible to intrusive conduct. This can arise where, for example, there is a prior relationship that enabled the offender to gain compromising material relating to the victim, and to exploit that when stalking the victim.

58     Further, I consider that a victim’s vulnerability _on account of age_ should be allowed more potential importance than _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) proposes, although perhaps only slightly.

59      **_Empirically_**, the vulnerability of victims on account of age seems to have been a more important sentencing factor than _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) suggested. In this regard, the sentences in both precedents involving minors (which the Prosecution submitted)—_Tan Yao Min_ (HC) and _Ng Hanwei_—were higher than suggested by _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) and, the Prosecution highlighted, were no less than 5 months’ imprisonment. However, this point cannot be overstated, as there are also matters apart from the age of the victim (_eg_, the intrusiveness of the stalking (although subject to my comments above at \[53\]–\[56\]) and the offender’s antecedents) that can account for the sentences in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) and _Ng Hanwei_.

60     As a matter of **_principle_** and **_policy_**, there is good reason for the emphasis on young victims. Speaking _generally_, deterrence is ordinarily an important sentencing consideration where an offence has been committed against young victims. More _specifically_, the harassment of minors is regarded as a prevalent and serious issue, and sentences should be sufficiently stern to reflect this. In the PHB Second Reading Speech cited above at \[55\], the Minister went on to state:

> In schools we are familiar with the kinds of bullying that take place – name-calling, inappropriate jokes, intimidating behaviour, and the like. Bullying of children by other children can scar – both the bully and the bullied – for life. Worse, bullying of children can also lead to devastating consequences. Again this is a worldwide trend with increasing frequency. \[The Minister went on to recount examples involving children aged 11–17 in United Kingdom, Canada and Italy, and the legislative response in these jurisdictions as well as others.\]

#### Harm caused to victim

61      **Third**, the dissemination of compromising material should not necessarily be distinct from extraordinary harm; alternatively, extraordinary harm should be allowed more potential importance than proposed in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC). In this regard, _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) does not appear perfectly aligned with _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) and _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) on this point.

62     Specifically, _Tan Yao Min_ (HC), having considered _Lai Zhi Heng_ in some detail, upheld a sentence of 8 months’ imprisonment. In other words, despite the more protracted/frequent stalking in _Lai Zhi Heng_ (1.5 years as compared to 1.5 months) and the dissemination of compromising material, the offender in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) received a sentence higher by 2 months. (This figure might have been even larger considering that the sentence in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) might have been lowered on account of the totality principle (as explained above at \[46(c)\], and the fact that this figure has not been adjusted upward to account for the discounting effect of the guilty pleas in both cases.) A reason (perhaps _the_ principal reason) appears to be that the victim and her family had to take numerous self-help measures (_Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[90\]–\[91\]), which presumably is one manifestation of extraordinary harm. In contrast, at the first stage of analysis, _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) ascribed 8 more points (or the equivalent of 6.4 months’ more imprisonment) to _Lai Zhi Heng_ than to _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) on account of the dissemination of compromising material and use of threats (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[51\]); while _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC), in considering that its facts should be pegged “just below” _Lai Zhi Heng_, considered it significant that there was no dissemination of compromising material to third parties (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[56(a)\], \[64\] and \[68\]) even though the stalking unfolded over a longer duration. This suggests _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC)—despite its other disagreements with _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC)—is more aligned with it than with _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) in principle in according a substantial amount of weight to the dissemination of compromising material.

63     As a matter of **_principle_** and **_policy_**, stalking can arise from diverse facts and cause a wide variety of harm. In the PHB Second Reading Speech, the Minister singled out several examples that where long-lasting harm was caused by conduct other than the dissemination of compromising material. I therefore think that _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) is most correct in principle on this issue. Without trivialising the harm that results from the dissemination of compromising material, the courts should not always treat other kinds of harm less seriously just because they do not involve one kind of intrusion.

#### Offender’s mens rea

64      **Finally**, one matter I considered relevant but not discussed in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) is the offender’s _mens rea_. This was, in a sense, treated as a relevant sentencing factor in _Lee Shing Chan_ at \[46\].

65     Unlawful stalking admits of 3 levels of _mens rea_, _ie_, where the offender:

> (a)      _intends_ his course of conduct to cause harassment, alarm or distress to a victim (under s 7(2)(_c_)(i) of the PHA);

> (b)      _knows_ that his course of conduct is _likely_ to cause harassment, alarm or distress to a victim (under s 7(2)(_c_)(ii) of the PHA); and

> (c)      _ought reasonably to know_ that his course of conduct is _likely_ to cause harassment, alarm or distress to a victim (under s 7(2)(_c_)(ii) of the PHA).

66     Although the same range of punishment is prescribed for all 3 levels of _mens rea_, it does not follow that an offender’s culpability does not depend on the _mens rea_. Quite the contrary: in my view, all things equal, a charge with a less severe _mens rea_ is a less serious charge, and should not be punished as if the offender was charged with a graver _mens rea_. Looked at in another way, to punish the facts without regard to the seriousness of the _mens rea_ in the charge, in a sense, risks diluting prosecutorial discretion. It would be important, when comparing precedents, to take into account the _mens rea_ involved.

### Part 3A: The relevant sentencing factors examined

67     As a preliminary observation, I was not urged to place any particular sentencing imperative at the forefront. Nonetheless, I was prepared to accept that the sentence should reflect an element of specific deterrence. The PHB Second Reading Speech reveals that the decision was taken to pass the PHA, rather than to amend the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“MOA”), to provide more comprehensively for conduct not captured by the MOA, and to broaden the range of penalties to include imprisonment (the maximum penalty under the MOA, often a $5,000 fine, was considered “inadequate”). In the context of criminal penalties for unlawful stalking specifically, the Minister stated that what victims “need is for the stalking to stop immediately and permanently”. In some cases, of course, rehabilitation is more properly the dominant sentencing principle, but this is not one such case. With this in mind, I examine the various sentencing factors.

#### Offence-specific factors

##### (1)   Offender’s _mens rea_

68     First, I note that the charge stated that Mr Ng ought reasonably to have known that his conduct was likely to cause V harassment, alarm or distress. In other words, it was the lowest form of _mens rea_ for a charge under s 7 PHA.

##### (2)   Duration/frequency of stalking

69     I did not fully agree with the Prosecution’s submission that, in terms of duration/frequency of stalking, Mr Ng’s conduct was extremely persistent and prolonged.

70     I accept, _first_, that Mr Ng persisted in propositioning V despite the fact V repeatedly rejected Mr Ng’s advances and, _second_, that after V blocked Mr Ng on Facebook, he continued the harassment on three new channels, stopping only because he was arrested. However, while the harassment lasted some 11 months (on the face of the charge and SOF), it is not entirely true that during this duration he sent multiple messages “on a daily basis to harangue the victim for a protracted period of time”.[^15] This analysis is not unlike that found in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[75\], where Chan J noted that the stalking did _not_ amount to a “daily intrusion”. Quantitatively:

> (a)     Based on the SOF and annexes tendered to me, there were only 42 discrete days on which V received messages from Mr Ng. On some of these days, Mr Ng only sent 1 or 2 messages per day, and their content was not lewd.

> (b)     Most of the harassment took place within relatively confined windows. In my estimation:

>> (i)       about 65% of the exchange took place over 14 Mar–5 Apr 2017 (_ie_, 23 days);

>> (ii)       about 10% of the exchange took place on 8–9 and 20–22 Apr 2017 (_ie_, 5 days); and

>> (iii)       about 15% of the exchange took place on 20–23 Feb 2018 (_ie_, 4 days).

> (c)     There were significant periods where A:

>> (i)       either sent relatively few messages (_ie_, 25 Jun–20 Aug);

>> (ii)       or did not actually send V any messages at all:

>>> (A)       23 Apr–24 Jun (_ie_, 2 months); and

>>> (B)       21 Aug 2017–19 Feb 2018 (_ie_, nearly 6 months). (In this regard, I have ignored the 4 messages which, based on Annex A, were apparently sent via Facebook on 16, 21, 24 and 25 October 2018. It appears that V, having blocked Mr Ng, would not have received these messages. In any event, the existence of those messages is inconsistent with the SOF.[^16] In any further event, those messages were in my judgment innocuous and quite immaterial.)

71     Under the points system, I would have awarded about 3.5–4 out of 5 possible points for the duration/frequency of stalking.

##### (3)   Intrusiveness

72     In my view, the degree of intrusion was relatively slight.

73     While Mr Ng stalked V entirely through electronic means, it escalated from modes which were merely internet-enabled (_ie_, Facebook) to modes linked to V’s mobile number (_ie_, WhatsApp and text message) when V blocked him on Facebook. In total, Mr Ng stalked V over 4 different channels. However, beyond this, Mr Ng did not exploit or abuse the electronic modes of communication for their harmful potential, and this aspect of his conduct should not attract the kind of opprobrium expressed in _Adrian Goh_ or _Sim Kang Wei_.

74     Under the points system, I would have awarded 1–1.5 out of 3 possible points for the intrusiveness.

##### (4)   V’s vulnerability and the content of the communications

75     I found that V was vulnerable, as she was 14–15 years old at the material time. What makes this factor more significant, however, is the inappropriate content of the harassment.

76      _First_, Mr Ng’s language was often profane and tended to corrupt V.

77      _Second_, Mr Ng had sent V, twice each, a picture of a pair of breasts and a picture of a penis.

78      _Third_, as the Prosecution submitted, Mr Ng, although aware that V was underage and it would be an offence to have sex with V, had repeatedly asked V for sexual favours of all sorts. In this regard, the messages were rather depraved in the beginning and only got worse. In this respect, no other precedent I am aware of quite compares with the present case. Between 11 and 13 March 2017 (_ie_, even before the harassment began according to the charge), A had asked to:

> (a)     be V’s boyfriend;

> (b)     see V’s body;

> (c)     touch V’s body and private parts;

> (d)     kiss V;

> (e)     have sex with V; and

> (f)     lick V’s private parts.

Those requests were repeated on or after 14 March 2017. But, in addition, he even asked (among other things):

> (g)     to hug V (since 14 Mar 2017);

> (h)     to molest V (on 15 Mar 2017);

> (i)     to hold V’s hands (since 15 Mar 2017);

> (j)     to penetrate V with his finger (since 19 Mar 2017);

> (k)     to ejaculate on V’s face (since 19 Mar 2017);

> (l)     V to help him masturbate (since 19 Mar 2017);

> (m)     V to perform oral sex on him (since 20 Mar 2017);

> (n)     to strip V (since 24 Mar 2017);

> (o)     V to send him a picture of her breasts (since 24 Mar 2017);

> (p)     to masturbate V (since 28 Mar 2017);

> (q)     to have anal sex with V (since 2 Apr 2017);

> (r)     V to lick his nipples (on 5 Apr 2017); and

> (s)     to rape V (on 20 Feb 2018).

I pay particular attention to Mr Ng’s mention of molest on 15 March 2017 and rape on 20 February 2018. Although these statements were brief considering the entire exchange between Mr Ng and V and were not framed in the “_P_ unless _Q_” syntax typical of threats, they cannot be dismissed as statements made purely in jest or in passing. They would have caused V to somewhat fear more for her physical safety. The mention of rape is notable in two senses: it demonstrated the escalating seriousness of the conduct that Mr Ng had been contemplating; and it came shortly after Mr Ng managed to re-establish communication with V over another channel, after having been blocked on Facebook.

79      _Fourth_, when V said on 3 April 2017 she would “report” Mr Ng, he responded by taunting V. V warned Mr Ng that she would block him on Facebook if he continued to send her such messages, but Mr Ng replied saying that she could not stop him and implying that he was not afraid of going to jail, having been jailed before:

![]([2019] SGMC 0078_Image/[2019] SGMC 0078_image2.png)

80     I agreed with the Prosecution that this factor should attract the maximum 3 points under the points system.

81     I would have been prepared to ascribe a further 1–2 more points in total under the rubric of “use of threats”. Although not urged upon me by the Prosecution, this appeared to be a better way to treat the facts within the confines of the points system (rather than to say, as the Prosecution did, that the recommended sentence would be manifestly inadequate given the aggravating facts; this is because the points system was intended to put each aggravating fact in its proper perspective in the first place).

##### (5)   Extraordinary harm

82     I find that, on the whole, V did not suffer much extraordinary harm.

83     V gave an unrefuted victim impact statement (“VIS”) stating that she feared being raped as she knew that A knew how she looked like was now afraid to chat with unknown persons on social media platforms. I note, however, that she has, despite opening up to her friends, teachers, and (eventually) parents, _not_ sought intervention from a counsellor or psychologist. There is also no suggestion that V requires such intervention.

84     I would thus agree with the Prosecution that, under the points system, 1 out of 3 possible points should be ascribed for harm caused.

#### Offender-specific factors

##### (1)   Antecedents

85     Mr Ng’s antecedents were, in my view, not germane to the present case and therefore not a material sentencing consideration.

##### (2)   Guilty plea/remorse

86     On the whole, I considered that Mr Ng’s putative sentence should be reduced on account of his guilty plea, but only slightly.

87      _First_, I considered that the guilty plea by itself was some demonstration of remorse.

88     The prosecution submitted that Mr Ng had shown little remorse, because he failed to attend court when he was scheduled to plead guilty, had to be arrested pursuant to a warrant of arrest, and subsequently claimed trial to the charge (only to plead guilty on the first day of trial). The Prosecution added that this showed that Mr Ng did not want to accept responsibility for his actions until the last minute.

89     Broadly, I found it difficult to accept the Prosecution’s submission insofar as it characterised Mr Ng’s supposed lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. While an offender’s failure to attend court _can_ be aggravating, Mr Ng’s failure to attend court once, when viewed in its proper context, has limited aggravating effect. As the Prosecution accepted and as Mr Ng confirmed, Mr Ng did not attend court because he was not prepared to agree with the Prosecution’s sentencing position although ready to plead guilty.[^17] This may have been an unwise course of action, but is something I am at least partially prepared to overlook on the ground that he was unrepresented then. At any rate, the present situation is markedly different from a case where an offender absconds and remains at large for a number of years (_cf Public Prosecutor v Ng Kwok Fai_ <span class="citation">\[2004\] SGDC 232</span> at \[13\]). The mere fact that Mr Ng, for some time, claimed trial is also not aggravating (_Kuek Ah Lek v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[1995\] 2 SLR(R) 766</span> at \[65\])—it is simply a neutral factor. In fact, Mr Ng’s reason for claiming trial was not so much that he denied committing the offence. In my judgment, these matters do not establish that Mr Ng lacked remorse.

90      _Second_, however, while V did not have to fully re-live her ordeal by having to testify in court, she would have had to re-live it in the lead-up to trial since a summons had been issued against V to attend court.

91      _Third_, there was also limited savings of State resources since an earlier court date fixed for the taking of a guilty plea had been wasted, and State resources had to be expended in re-arresting Mr Ng, the guilty plea came on the day of the trial itself.

#### The supposed outcome under the points system

92     On the whole, under the points system, Mr Ng’s notional first-stage sentence would have been 3.6–5.2 months’ imprisonment (on the basis of 9.5–11.5 points), which I would have been prepared to reduce to the region of 3.3–4.7 months’ imprisonment at the second stage by discounting the sentence by just under 10% on account of the guilty plea.

93     Nonetheless, I considered that an appropriate sentence would be about 5.5 months’ imprisonment. **_First_**, it seemed to me that the most appropriate sentence should be in a somewhat higher range than what the points system recommended. The rubric of vulnerability does not fully capture the depraved, profane and corruptive nature of the communications here, since it seems that the maximum 3 points would have been awarded even if the communications were not as sexually-charged (_Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) was prepared to ascribe the maximum 3 points in _Ng Hanwei_ (discussed below at \[99\] _et seq_) for what I think was noticeably less serious conduct). With these in mind, I would consider a sentence in the region of 4.5 months’ to 6 months’ imprisonment rather more appropriate. **_Second_**, I considered that, within this range, a 5.5-month imprisonment term would be sufficiently firm to reflect the principle of specific deterrence that I think should underpin this sentence.

### Part 3B: Comparison with precedents

94     I now compare the present case with a number of precedents that, in some sense, involve some sort of unrequited interest on the offender’s part. I will also examine 2 more precedents involving rather different facts, in the interest of considering whether the sentence I passed is consistent with stalking arising from rather different fact patterns (in view of my comments above at \[26\]–\[29\]).

95     I begin with 2 general remarks. **_First_**, I accept that the contents of the communication in the present case are profane and very depraved and corruptive and, in that sense, no precedent quite compares with it. I also accept that V was vulnerable by reason of age. The harassment that V felt cannot be trivialised. However, absent from the present case are other factors which I think are major determinants of the sentences in other cases. **_Second_**, I do not think the precedents have been impeccably consistent in their approach in weighing each sentencing factor. In the light of my views above, my comparisons with the precedents suggest that the sentence that is most appropriate—and which does least violence to the principle of parity—lies in the region of 5–6 months’ imprisonment. Certainly, I did not think this case merited the 8-month imprisonment term that the Prosecution sought.

#### Precedents involving unrequited feelings

##### (1)    _Tan Yao Min_ (HC)

96     In **_Tan Yao Min_** **(HC)**, the offender, who was obsessed with two biological sisters, pleaded guilty to 3 charges: criminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”); intentionally causing alarm under s 3(1)(_b_) of the PHA, and unlawful stalking under s 7(1) of the PHA. The charge for causing alarm involved leaving a note for their grandmother in the flyer box attached to their door, expressing his sexual desires as regards both sisters but, in particular, the younger sister. The stalking charge involved a course of conduct between 12 January and 24 February 2017 as regards the younger sister:

> (a)     waiting for the victim at the bench near the block of flats in which she resided;

> (b)     following her around her neighbourhood;

> (c)     trying to make eye contact with her at the bus stop near her block of flats;

> (d)     knocking on the bus window next to her seat (from the outside) when her bus was at a traffic junction in her neighbourhood;

> (e)     asking her to be added as his friend on Facebook; and

> (f)     speaking with her father’s colleague at her father’s workplace.

97     The offender in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) was sentenced to 8 months’ imprisonment. While the victims in both _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) and the present case were equally vulnerable (both being 14 years old when the respective stalking began), I think that Mr Ng’s culpability nonetheless is—contrary to the Prosecution’s submissions—markedly less.

> (a)      **_First_**, I can accept that the duration and frequency of stalking in the present case is more serious. But, as explained above at \[69\]–\[71\], the apparent length of the stalking here must be taken in context: much of the stalking unfolded over the same duration as that of the course of conduct in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) (_ie_, slightly less than 1.5 months). I can also accept that the communications here were more profane and depraved. (Although both offenders had similar intentions, I note that the stalking charge _per se_ did not refer to sexually-charged communications.) However, in my view, these are more than offset by three related facts. _First_, the stalking in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) was more intrusive, since it involved being physically near the victim around her home and neighbourhood. _Second_, the stalking there involved third parties and had affected the victim’s family. The latter ties in with the _third_ point: the more extensive harm experienced by the victim: in a detailed VIS, she disclosed that she was afraid to leave her house, contemplated skipping school to avoid seeing the offender, and had to keep looking over her shoulder and listen for any followers’ footsteps. Her father had to personally escort her to the bus stop to wait for her bus to school and, when he could not, she had to carry an umbrella, a torchlight and a distress siren to safeguard herself. When going home, she had to try to get her female classmates to accompany her and walk her to the lift lobby of her block of flats, and she would detour to crowded areas if she spotted the offender while going home alone or call her parents to come downstairs to escort her home if returning home at night. She had developed a fear and distrust of male strangers, and her studies were affected.

> (b)      **_Second_**, in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC), the offender had two series of relevant antecedents within against the same victim at the same residence, dating from some 6 years prior:

>> (i)       In late 2010 (when he was just shy of 15 years old), he was found guilty of 1 charge of wrongful confinement under s 342 of the PC; 1 charge of attempted mischief under s 426 read with s 511 of the PC; and 4 charges of mischief under s 426 of the PC (with a further 7 TIC charges of mischief). Of these, the wrongful confinement charge and 1 mischief charge related to the victim. The mischief charges generally related to incidents where the offender trailed young girls whom he found attractive to their homes, and used black ink markers to write on the walls outside their homes asking their parents’ to let him have sex with their daughters. The wrongful confinement charge involved using a bicycle lock to chain up the metal grille gate of the victim’s home. For these, the offender was ordered to reside in a juvenile home for 30 months.

>> (ii)       In May 2015 (when he was aged 19), he was found guilty of 1 charge of making an insulting communication with intent to cause alarm under s 3(1)(_b_) of the PHA. The offender had, with intent to cause alarm to the victim’s father, pasted 5 notes outside his home. Essentially, three promised money in exchange for sex with his daughter; one expressed the offender’s desire to touch his daughter’s nipple; and the last said that he would face consequences unless he let the offender touch his daughter. For this, he was sentenced to 15 months’ supervised probation with conditions comprising a bond for good behaviour, a curfew, attendance and compliance with psychiatric treatment and medication, and attendance at relevant programmes on sexual offending.

> These antecedents were also considered to be “highly aggravating” and meant that the guilty plea evidenced no genuine remorse (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[64\]; see also _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[100\]–\[101\])—this would have reduced the mitigating value of the guilty plea, such that it would be worth as little as the guilty plea here. I agree with the view in _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) that the antecedents alone would have warranted an uplift of at least 2 months’ imprisonment (see above at \[51(b)\]).

> (c)      **_Third_**, in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC), the offender had 3 TIC charges: 1 charge of using threatening behaviour towards the victim under s 3(1)(_a_) of the PHA; 1 charge of making threatening communications toward the victim’s grandmother under s 3(1)(_b_) of the PHA; and 1 charge of unlawfully stalking the victim’s elder sister under s 7(1) of the PHA.

98     These matters in totality suggest that the sentence here should, by comparison, be in the region of 4.5–5.5 months’ imprisonment. However, as explained above at \[46(c)\], the sentence in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) might have been even higher to begin with.

##### (2)    _Ng Hanwei_

99     In **_Ng Hanwei_**, the offender pleaded guilty to unlawfully stalking a girl (then aged 12) by:

> (a)     loitering at a staircase landing at the block of flats where she lived, following her into the lift, following her to her school, and asking her “why did you walk so fast?”;

> (b)     10 days thereafter, loitering at the same staircase landing, entering the lift while she was inside (although at a different floor from that where she entered), asking for her name and if she had a mobile phone, following her until she had reached a different block of flats, asking her for her favourite colour, and asking if he could kiss her; and

> (c)     1 day thereafter, walking past the flat where the victim stayed (while she was inside) and looking inside her unit (on this occasion, while he waited at the same staircase landing, he ultimately did not take the same lift as her as she was accompanied by her brother).

100    In my view, Mr Ng’s overall culpability in my view is somewhat more than that of the offender in _Ng Hanwei_, who was sentenced to 5 months’ imprisonment.

> (a)      **_First_**, the stalking in _Ng Hanwei_ was considerably more intrusive as the offender had been physically near the victim around her home; and the victim in _Ng Hanwei_ is very slightly more vulnerable by virtue of age. However, this is outweighed by a few facts. _First_, the communication here was clearly far more profane and depraved, since the most offensive communication there seemed to be to ask if he could kiss her (which, if she had given her consent, would not have been illegal). _Second_, the duration and frequency of stalking here is considerably worse, since the charge in _Ng Hanwei_ involved only 3 incidents on either end of a 12-day period. _Third_, in comparison to V, the victim there did not appear to have suffered harm enough to raise in a VIS or otherwise.

> (b)      **_Second_**, the _mens rea_ in _Ng Hanwei_ involved an intent to cause harassment. This would have justified a higher sentence in _Ng Hanwei_, all other things equal.

> (c)      **_Third_**, while the offender in _Ng Hanwei_ pleaded guilty, this is more than outweighed by his 3 series of relevant antecedents, dating from some 8 years prior:

>> (i)       In 2008, when he was aged 16, he was convicted of 2 counts of outrage of modesty under s 354(2) of the PC (with 1 more TIC charge); these involved 2 minor victims. He also faced 2 charges under s 35 of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1997 Rev Ed) (“MOA”) of fraudulent possession of property. For this, he was sentenced to probation and to reside at a juvenile home for 30 months with a curfew.

>> (ii)       In 2011, he was convicted of 3 counts of outrage of modesty under s 354(1) of the PC, with 2 more TIC charges. He was sentenced to reformative training.

>> (iii)       In 2015, he was convicted of 1 count of insulting a woman’s modesty under s 509 of the PC (with 2 more TIC charges). Each count related to taking an up-skirt photo. For this, he was sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment.

> If the logic in _Tan Yao Min_ (HC) at \[100\] applies, these antecedents might negate any discount on account of remorse that might have otherwise been inferred from the guilty plea. Specifically, subject to my comments below, I agree with _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) that the antecedents would have warranted an uplift of at least 1 month’s imprisonment (see above at \[51(b)\]).

101    On the face of the above discussion, I think the relative seriousness of the offence here outweighs the countervailing effect of the offender-specific factors by a noticeable margin. By comparison, these matters suggest that the sentence here should be in the region of 7 months’ imprisonment. However, as explained above at \[46(b)\]–\[46(c)\], I consider the sentence in _Ng Hanwei_, if anything, to appear slightly firm when compared to _Nelson Tan_ and _Tan Yao Min_ (HC). That said, what might justify the sentence in _Ng Hanwei_ is the fact—not apparent from his criminal record—that his antecedents are more aggravating than one would have thought, in that they reveal sexually deviant behaviour toward minors. The 2 MOA charges in 2008 involved female apparel, including undergarments, reasonably suspected of being stolen, while the 3 accompanying outrage of modesty charges involved 2 minor victims. Of the 5 outrage of modesty charges in 2011, 2 proceeded charges and the 2 TIC charges involved 3 minor victims. It is unclear, however, if these facts were highlighted to the sentencing court.

##### (3)    _Moh Yan Chung_

102    In _Public Prosecutor v Moh Yan Chung_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGDC 46</span> (“**_Moh Yan Chung_**”), the offender pleaded guilty on the first day of trial to a charge of unlawful stalking under s 7(1) of the PHA. The victim had been a minor with whom the offender had commercial sex (for which he faced 5 charges under s 376B(1) of the PC). Since 2014 (_ie_, just as the victim was turning 18), the offender had established who the victim’s friends were by accessing her photos on Facebook, and between 29 January 2016 and May 2016 contacted at least five of them to “warn” them of the kind of person she was and to inform them of the victim’s sexual activities. He also met the victim’s then-boyfriend (“B”), informed B of the pending investigations into the offences of commercial sex with a minor, and sought B’s assistance to prove his innocence.

103    In respect of the stalking charge, I considered Mr Ng’s overall culpability to be slightly less than that of the offender in _Moh Yan Chung_, who for this charge was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

> (a)      **_First_**, the victims’ vulnerability were comparable (at worst, V was slightly more vulnerable). The difference in vulnerability in terms of age cannot be overstated: at the time they were first stalked, although V was younger, the victim in _Moh Yan Chung_ was only just coming of age. Also, the age difference between offender and victim in _Moh Yan Chung_ is wider than in the present case (the offender there was between 37 and 40 years old at the time of stalking). Further, on the Prosecution’s own submissions (see above at \[31\]),[^18] the vulnerability of the victim in _Moh Yan Chung_ would also have been increased by her sexual relationship with the offender. Even if a commercial one, it enabled the stalking to unfold as it did. Indeed, the DJ in _Moh Yan Chung_ considered the victim to be vulnerable (at \[27\]).

> (b)      **_Second_**, other offence-specific factors are quite finely balanced. The duration and frequency of stalking in _Moh Yan Chung_, contrary to the Prosecution’s submission, does not seem to be “far shorter” than in this case.[^19] On the face of the charge and SOF, the stalking in _Moh Yan Chung_ unfolded over some 2 years. Even if the crux of the stalking there (_ie_, the communication with the victim’s friends and then-boyfriend) took place over some 3 months, much of the stalking here was also confined to a narrower timeframe than the charge suggests. While the communications here were more profane and depraved, I consider this substantially offset by the fact that the offender in _Moh Yan Chung_ disseminated compromising information to third parties (and this extended to meeting B in person). In fairness, however, for the purpose of comparison, I hesitate to attribute the sentence to the harm suffered by the victim (_ie_, that the stalking had caused B to break up with the victim and “practically \[destroy her\] efforts … to focus on rebuilding her life” (_Moh Yan Chung_ at \[20\])), because it seems that the DJ (whether rightly or wrongly) considered this an aggravating factor for the charge involving commercial underage sex instead (_Moh Yan Chung_ at \[19\]–\[21\]).

> (c)      **_Third_**, the value of the offender’s guilty plea/remorse in both cases are comparable (if anything, the present facts are very slightly more mitigating). While the outcome (_ie_, a guilty plea on the first day of trial) appears similar, the mitigating value of the guilty plea in _Moh Yan Chung_ came from the basis of sparing the victim from the trauma of testifying in a trial (_Moh Yan Chung_ at \[24\]) rather than remorse, given his attempts to deny liability for his offences. In contrast, while more State resources were expended (in arresting Mr Ng after he failed to attend court) or wasted (in terms of court hearings previously fixed for Mr Ng to plead guilty), he has demonstrated relatively more remorse, which I think bears a closer nexus to an offender’s culpability and therefore has more mitigating potential than the savings of resources.

> (d)      **_Finally_**, another matter would have justified a higher sentence in _Moh Yan Chung_. The unlawful stalking offence had been committed while on bail pending police investigations into offences of commercial sex with a minor, and in fact was committed in a bid to exculpate himself from those other offences. In my view, the DJ (rightly) regarded this as a significant factor and effectively agreed with the Prosecution that this called for “an appropriate sentence … such that the punishment meted out will persuade the accused to refrain from further unlawful conduct” (_Moh Yan Chung_ at \[23\]) or, in other words, a sentence underpinned by specific deterrence. I consider that the uplift, in this case, might have been in the region of 2 weeks’ to 1 month’s imprisonment, considering that in _Muhammad Nurizam_, the Court sentenced the offender to 5 months’ imprisonment on the second unlawful stalking charge there (compared to 4 months’ imprisonment on the first) on account of the fact that the second offence involved slightly more acts of stalking and was committed while on bail after having been arrested in relation to the first offence. This factor, in my view, outweighs the net effect of the three areas discussed above.

##### (4)    _Tan Boon Wah_

104    In **_Tan Boon Wah_**, the offender pleaded guilty to unlawfully stalking his former male partner (with whom he had been in a relationship for some 4 years) for slightly more than 1 year.[^20] The bulk of the stalking[^21] comprised the following:

> (a)     He loitered outside the victim’s home on a daily basis in the morning (_ie_, from around 6am to 7.30am) and at night (from between 6pm and 9pm to approximately 11pm, when the victim had turned off the lights at home), and outside the victim’s army camp (where he was serving national service) on a daily basis in the evening, and attempting to confront and converse with him when he appeared.

> (b)     He followed the victim on numerous occasions to places that the latter frequented.

> (c)     He placed numerous harassing phone calls and sending numerous harassing text messages and e-mails to the victim. As regards the calls, he would use both his mobile phone number, Skype Voice-over-IP to make calls that registered as private number calls, and spoofed numbers that were either unusual or belonged to the victim’s friends and families and official hotlines (including those for National Service, SingTel, Jurong Police Division, and the Police and Fire emergency services).[^22] His e-mails would contain questions about specific places he had seen the victim at (thus giving the impression that the victim was under surveillance), or expressing his determination not to desist from his behaviour.

> (d)     He uploaded on his Facebook account photographs of both of them kissing, and threatened to disseminate them to the victim’s acquaintances unless the victim e-mailed or called him.

> (e)     He e-mailed the victim photographs of him in the nude taken without his consent, intending to compel the victim to reply to his e-mails.[^23]

105    The court sentenced the offender to 6 months’ imprisonment (as the Prosecution sought). In my view, Mr Ng’s overall culpability is less than that of the offender in _Tan Boon Wah_.

> (a)      **_First_**, while V was a minor, the victim in _Tan Boon Wah_ was also vulnerable by virtue of a former relationship with the offender,[^24] as was the case with _Moh Yan Chung_ and _Lai Zhi Heng_ (see above at \[103(a)\] and below at \[108(a)\]). As will be evident below, the offender used his knowledge of the victim’s personal details gained during that relationship to further his acts of stalking. On the whole, I consider V somewhat more vulnerable than the victim in _Tan Boon Wah_.

> (b)      **_Second_**, the profanity and depravity of the communications in the present case (and the relative vulnerability of V as described above) were more than offset by the various aspects of the stalking there. _First_, the duration and frequency of stalking was far worse in _Tan Boon Wah_. While V enjoyed many intervening months of silence or relatively minor stalking, the victim there faced daily harassment and even received up to 1,408 calls in a single day. On at least 4 other days, he received some 700–900 missed calls.[^25] When he placed his phone on do-not-disturb mode in response to the stalking, the offender sent him a taunting e-mail, suggesting that he might miss important e-mails from the government or army—I think such a taunt is worse than Mr Ng’s taunt (_cf_ above at \[79\]). _Second_, the offender employed several modes of stalking, some of which were plainly intrusive (_ie_, loitering near the victim’s home, workplace and frequent haunts). _Third_, the offender circulated moderately compromising photographs to a closed group of third parties, and threatened to disseminate those photographs to a wider class of persons. _Fourth_, the harm caused to that victim[^26] was also far worse:

>> (i)       The victim’s father had to accompany the victim out of his home every morning to prevent him from being harassed by the offender (and to capture his actions as evidence),[^27] and the family had to install a CCTV outside their unit. This cost about $1,000.[^28]

>> (ii)       The victim had to take a taxi home from his camp every day (instead of the bus or train), and had to take roundabout routes to the places he frequented. He estimated that this would have added a “few thousand dollars” to his expenses.[^29]

>> (iii)       The victim had to change his phone number each time the offender managed to obtain his new number, and to buy a second phone to receive calls from people apart from family and friends. His expenses in this regard totalled $2,100.

>> (iv)       The victim was distressed that the offender’s daily presence outside his army camp came to his colleagues’ and superiors’ attention, and he developed a distrust of others. His mother had difficulty sleeping from fear of the offender’s presence outside their home, and became paranoid about the accused eavesdropping on their conversations; while his father developed anger issues from the offender’s refusal to desist from his conduct. The victim also experienced many disputes with his family because of the stalking.[^30] This led to the victim seeking one session of counselling.[^31]

>> (v)       The stalking affected the victim to the extent that he lodged 22 police reports in relation thereto in the duration he had been stalked.

> (c)      **_Third_**, while the offender in _Tan Boon Wah_ would have enjoyed the full mitigating value of a guilty plea, this is offset by the fact that he faced other charges. Apart from being convicted on 1 count of obtaining access to the victim’s personal data under s 51(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Act 26 of 2012), for which he was sentenced to 2 months’ (concurrent) imprisonment (this involved requesting for the victim’s new mobile phone number by holding himself out as the victim and furnishing the victim’s personal particulars acquired in the course of their prior relationship),[^32] he faced a further TIC charge of cheating by personation under s 419 of the PC (this involved dishonestly inducing delivery of a parcel meant for the victim from the postman, by holding himself out as the victim).[^33]

106    In my judgment, the effect of increased vulnerability of the victim is outweighed by the effect of increased seriousness of the other offence-specific factors. By comparison to _Tan Boon Wah_, an appropriate sentence here might be in the range of 4.5–5 months’ imprisonment.

##### (5)    _Lai Zhi Heng_

107    In **_Lai Zhi Heng_**, the offender pleaded guilty to unlawfully stalking the victim (a girl with whom he had been in a brief sexual relationship) for about 1 year. This included:

> (a)     following the victim on numerous occasions (and, on one occasion, following her in his car such that he had to brake hard at one point to avoid hitting her);[^34]

> (b)     sending numerous harassing WhatsApp and text messages to her;[^35]

> (c)     threatening to release the victim’s nude photographs unless she complied with his requests (including requests to meet him and send more nude photographs of herself); and

> (d)     disseminating, in the vicinity of the victim’s residence (including placing on the walls/in the lifts and in the letter boxes of the victim’s block of flats),[^36] flyers with the victim’s nude photographs (and accompanying harassing messages) and pamphlets containing the victim’s personal information and, on 3 occasions, uploading the victim’s nude photographs and messages alleging that she was a prostitute onto a Facebook group for the co-curricular activity in her new school (to which she had transferred in a bid to avoid the stalking);

108    In my view, Mr Ng’s overall culpability is noticeably less than that of the offender in _Lai Zhi Heng_, who was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment.

> (a)      **_First_**, while V was a minor, the victim in _Lai Zhi Heng_ was also vulnerable by virtue of a former relationship with the offender, as was the case with _Tan Boon Wah_ (see above at \[105(a)\]). In particular, some 1.5 years before the stalking began (based on the charge), the offender had procured a photograph of the victim’s vagina in exchange for a photograph of his penis and by issuing threats of harassment. This became the substrate that gave force to, and helped perpetuate, the offender’s threats that were the subject of the stalking.[^37] On the whole, I consider V slightly more vulnerable than the victim in _Lai Zhi Heng_.

> (b)      **_Second_**, the profanity and depravity of the communications here was outweighed by the various aspects of the stalking there by a clear margin.

>> (i)        _First_, the frequency of stalking in _Lai Zhi Heng_ was more sustained over its entire duration, even if the stalking here was more intense on some particular days.

>> (ii)        _Second_, the offender in _Lai Zhi Heng_ employed far more modes of stalking, some of which were intrusive to the point of physically endangering the victim.

>> (iii)        _Third_, as a result of the offender’s threats, the victim sent a total of 30 nude photographs of herself. These photographs were then used to back up subsequent threats. When the victim tried to get the offender to stop putting up the flyers, the accused extracted an “apology” by forcing her to write “I promise note \[_sic_\] to rebel again” 200 times.

>> (iv)        _Fourth_, the offender disseminated sensitive information and highly compromising photographs to various group of persons including the public.

>> (v)        _Fifth_, in terms of harm, the victim became afraid to travel alone and her mother had to quit her job to escort her to and from school.[^38] The victim ended up changing schools twice in an attempt to avoid the harassment.[^39] The public dissemination of nude photos caused the victim trauma, lost her friends,[^40] and made her contemplate suicide. She even visited the psychiatrist at least once over the duration of the stalking.[^41]

> (c)      **_Third_**, in terms of offender-specific factors, I accept that the offender in _Lai Zhi Heng_ was assessed to have a “mix of schizoid, antisocial and histrionic personality traits” and, secondary to these causing him difficulties in interpersonal life, mild persistent depressive disorder of which his increased irritability and anger was a possible manifestation, and that he pleaded guilty and sought self-help by joining an anger management program on his own accord. However, these must be balanced against a few considerations.

>> (i)        _First_, after he had been first charged for stalking, he approached the victim near her school for a letter pleading for leniency on his behalf. When the victim refused, he threatened to post her nude photographs online. While this became the subject of a separate charge of criminal intimidation under s 506 of the PC (and arguably should not be directly held against the offender), it evidenced, according to _Lim Teck Kim_ (HC) at \[51\], lesser remorse for his actions. This could have reduced the mitigating value of his guilty plea.

>> (ii)        _Second_, there was a further TIC charge: it involved unlawfully stalking the victim for a further 3-month period shortly thereafter. This involved following the victim, preventing her from boarding a train in an attempt to speak with her, leaving harassing messages addressed to her at public locations near her home, and leaving unsolicited sums of money under the front door of her home.[^42]

109    These matters in totality suggest that the sentence here, by comparison, should not exceed the region of 4 months’ imprisonment. Perhaps the sentence in _Lai Zhi Heng_ was as such because the Prosecution had submitted that a 6-month imprisonment term would suffice. Nonetheless, as explained above at \[46(a)\], I consider this sentence to have been somewhat lenient when compared to _Adrian Goh_.

##### (6)    _Adrian Goh_

110    In **_Adrian Goh_**, the offender pleaded guilty to unlawfully stalking his girlfriend of some 3 years (but with whom his relationship was strained). He had felt insecure about the victim’s close relationship with several male colleagues and resentful and upset that she was travelling to Kuala Lumpur with a male colleague (“her Colleague”), and thus did the following:

> (a)     One day, when the victim entrusted her mobile phone to the offender over lunch, he used her mobile phone to send messages to a WhatsApp chat group comprising colleagues and superiors (_ie_, such that the content appeared to originate from her). These comprised 4 nude photographs of her (which he had taken with her consent over the course of their relationship, on the condition that he did not disseminate them) and 2 messages suggesting that the victim was having an affair with her Colleague. He then deleted those messages from her phone and reacted to queries from her colleagues in a way that sought to dispel suspicions that her phone had been hacked into.

> (b)     3 days later, he sent an e-mail to the victim’s superior from a fictitious account that purported to represent a group of concerned colleagues. In it, he baselessly and falsely alleged that the victim and her Colleague were having sex in their workplace uniform.

> (c)     On that day, he also posted a letter to the victim’s home and addressed to her father, pretending to represent the victim’s church, suggesting that church-goers had found out that she was going overseas to have pre-marital sex with multiple partners, knowing that her family, being staunch Christians, would disapprove of such conduct.

111    In my view, Mr Ng’s overall culpability is comparable to that of the offender in _Adrian Goh_, who was sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment (which accorded with the upper end of the Prosecution’s submission of 5–6 months’ imprisonment).

> (a)      **_First_**, V, as a minor, is somewhat more vulnerable than the victim in _Adrian Goh_. However, the victim in _Adrian Goh_ was also vulnerable by virtue of a relationship with the offender (put another way, the offender abuse the trust the victim reposed in him). The victim’s nude photos and entrustment of her phone became the tool which the offender used in his acts of stalking.

> (b)      **_Second_**, while the stalking here was far more profane and depraved, and involved far greater duration and frequency, this was easily matched by the features of the stalking in _Adrian Goh_. _First_, highly compromising images were disseminated to a closed group of people. _Second_, in connection with this, although the mode of stalking was principally electronic, it was abused for its harmful potential (see above at \[53\]–\[56\]). _Third_, this was what the DJ found to be “a deliberated and calculated plan” intended not only to embarrass and humiliate the victim, [^43] cause her family to disapprove of her supposed behaviour and harm her reputation,[^44] but also to stymie both her and her Colleague’s careers.[^45] In this regard, it also affected a third party. _Fourth_, the victim there experienced more harm: she suffered countless sleepless nights for some time, and took leave for 10 days after the incident as she did not know how to face her colleagues. She was also afraid to see the offender on the street as she feared he would beat her up, and was afraid to enter a new romantic relationship for some time. In this regard, the DJ held that the effects of the stalking were “long lasting”.[^46]

> (c)      **_Third_**, the offender in _Adrian Goh_ had a graver _mens rea_, in that he intended to cause harassment. All other things equal, this would have justified a higher sentence in _Adrian Goh_.

> (d)      **_Fourth_**, while the offender in _Adrian Goh_ would have enjoyed the full mitigating value of a guilty plea, this would have been offset by the fact of another TIC charge (of knowingly possessing 331 obscene films under s 30(2)(_a_) of the Films Act (Cap 107, 1998 Rev Ed) (“FA”)).

112    In addition to the above, I also note that the sentence in _Adrian Goh_ was driven by general deterrence—a consideration not urged upon me. In sum, I think the present sentence should be slightly lower than that in _Adrian Goh_.

##### (7)    _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC)

113    In **_Sim Kang Wei_**, the offender pleaded guilty to unlawfully stalking a fellow undergraduate. Both of them had been acquainted for some years as they had attended the same secondary school and he was friends with her sister. However, they had stopped communicating some 2 years before the offences as her then-boyfriend did not like the offender contacting her, and she told the offender that they should stop exchanging messages. The offender’s conduct is described in detail in _Sim Kang Wei_ (DC) at \[46\]. But, briefly, over nearly 3 months, he:

> (a)     recorded 94 up-skirt videos of the victim without her knowledge (of which 53 were successful);

> (b)     joined the same university co-curricular activity as her;

> (c)     on her birthday, pestered her to hitch a ride home from her father despite her reluctance (this became a pretext to take up-skirt photos);

> (d)     accessed, took control of (some), extracted and read the contents of, sent messages from, and modified the passwords to her e-mail and social media accounts without authorisation;

> (e)     created a fake Instagram account that appeared to belong to her, and posted photographs of her and her ex-boyfriend with captions that carried sexual innuendoes that remained public until the police asked the offender to delete the account; and

> (f)     unsubscribed her from 2 university courses which she had registered for.

114    To procure the passcode to the victim’s phone, the offender stole her mobile phone and concocted a fake story to induce her to reveal her passcode (this formed the subject of a separate charge under s 379 of the PC).

115    The District Court imposed a sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment, but this was reduced by the High Court on appeal to 5 months’ imprisonment. In my view, Mr Ng’s overall culpability is comparable to or slightly more than that of the offender in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC).

> (a)      **_First_**, the aggregate duration and frequency of stalking in both cases was comparable. The stalking in _Sim Kang Wei_ unfolded over a shorter timeframe, but during that time the stalking was more consistently intense.

> (b)      **_Second_**, I can accept that V was considerably more vulnerable than the victim in _Sim Kang Wei_, where the age difference between victim and offender was small and there was no relationship giving rise to vulnerability. However, this, along with the profanity and depravity of the communications here, is somewhat outweighed by the seriousness of stalking in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC).

>> (i)        _First_, while the Judge seemed to think it significant that the offender did not disseminate the compromising photographs (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[64\]), he did not adversely comment on the DJ’s finding that the offender had “preten\[ded\] to be a knight in shining armour while simultaneously running a besmirch campaign against the victim filled with sexual innuendoes” (_Sim Kang Wei_ at \[50\]). If anything, given my views above at \[61\]–\[63\], the point that he did not disseminate compromising material should not be overstated.

>> (ii)        _Second_, in terms of intrusiveness, the offender employed several modes of stalking. Some involved being physically near the victim, while those that involved electronic means exploited their harmful and intrusive potential—the potential to be anonymous, access private data, and to surreptitiously take up-skirt videos (see above at \[53\]–\[56\]).

>> (iii)        _Third_, the offender also affected third parties, in the sense he extracted the password to, accessed, and sent the victim a message from, a social media account belonging to the victim’s ex-boyfriend.

>> (iv)        _Fourth_, the victim there suffered a range of harm. She stated in her VIS that she was traumatised and felt fear and violated as a result. Having had to review the up-skirt videos during investigations and realising how they were taken, she became worried that her up-skirt videos might surface in the future, and paranoid and constantly suspicious of people who held their phones near her. The victim felt fear and anxiety when going home, as she feared that the offender (who lived nearby) might attack her as she had caused him to be arrested.

> (c)      **_Third_**, the motivation of the offence in _Sim Kang Wei_ seemed to be an aggravating factor. He had started stalking her as he had developed a “hatred” for her when she stopped communicating with him, and he had deregistered her from her university courses as revenge for her telling her sister that the offender had “low EQ” and, in particular, he deregistered her a _second_ time from her university courses to get a reaction from her as the first time elicited no immediate reaction (_Sim Kang Wei_ at \[21(c)\] and \[45\]; the High Court expressed no adverse view on this).

> (d)      **_Fourth_**, the Judge considered that there were “strong” mitigating factors in this case, apart from the mere fact of a guilty plea. _First_, although the offender did not show remorse during investigations (he had denied committing the offences and concocted an elaborate story to deflect suspicion), he had since shown genuine remorse by writing a letter of apology to the victim, withdrawing from university, and initially deciding not to engage a lawyer because he wanted to take full responsibility for his actions. _Second_, the offender had shown rehabilitative progress, evidenced by positive recommendations in his MSF Psychological Report and Probation Report, the appellant’s willingness to receive help, and strong familial support available to him (_Sim Kang Wei_ (HC) at \[66\]–\[68\])). That said, these must be balanced against the fact there were 6 other TIC charges: 2 counts of possessing obscene films under s 30(1) of the FA; 3 counts of possessing films without a valid certificate under s 21(1)(_a_) of the FA; and 1 count of an attempt to insult a woman’s modesty (by taking an up-skirt video of an unknown female) under s 509 read with s 511 of the PC. (To put matters in perspective, the theft charge attracted a 3-day (concurrent) imprisonment term.) In my judgment, these offender-specific matters offset the increased seriousness of the offending conduct in _Sim Kang Wei_ (HC).

##### (8)    _Nelson Tan_

116    In **_Nelson Tan_**, the offender pleaded guilty to unlawfully stalking an ex-colleague for whom he had developed (unreciprocated) romantic feelings for a period of 1 year and 9 months. His course of conduct included:

> (a)     loitering around the places where the victim was, including:

>> (i)       around the victim’s residence (frequently throughout this duration (_ie_, 2–3 times per week at its most frequent) and, at least on 1 occasion, persisting despite a police advisory); and

>> (ii)       around the victim’s then-workplace (on 5 occasions in the first month, to observe the victim’s actions and monitor her interactions with her boyfriend (who was also working there)); and

>> (iii)       around the victim’s new workplace (on a weekly basis after he discovered where it was (she had left her employment about 7 months after the stalking began, and started working elsewhere another 1 month thereafter));

> (b)     leaving unsolicited items for her outside her home;

> (c)     on at least 1 occasion, sounding the doorbell to the victim’s home repeatedly;

> (d)     on at least 3 occasion, following the victim from her home; and

> (e)     over a 14-month period, sending 104 WhatsApp and Facebook messages expressing his feelings for her, repeatedly asking her to meet him, warning her to stay away from her boyfriend (whom he had called abusive names) and threatening harm to her boyfriend if she did not break up with him.

117    In my view, Mr Ng’s overall culpability is slightly more than that of the offender in _Nelson Tan_, who was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment.

> (a)      **_First_**, I can accept that V was considerably more vulnerable than the victim in _Nelson Tan_. (I do not think that the victim in _Nelson Tan_ was vulnerable by reason of a relationship as ex-colleagues.) However, this, combined with the profanity and depravity of the communications here, was offset by the various aspects of the stalking there.

>> (i)        _First_, not unlike _Lai Zhi Heng_, the stalking in _Nelson Tan_ unfolded over a longer duration and at more frequent intervals, even if the stalking here was more intense on some days.

>> (ii)        _Second_, in terms of the modes of stalking, _Nelson Tan_ largely involved loitering and intrusion into the victim’s physical space. Where the electronic modes were concerned, the offender created 3 fake Facebook profiles in succession to continue messaging the victim after she had blocked his original account (_ie_, he had exploited the harmful potential of stalking in cyberspace).

>> (iii)        _Third_, the offender threatened the victim with harm to her boyfriend.

>> (iv)        _Fourth_, the harm experienced by the victim was also considerable. She experienced mood swings (which led her to suddenly cry or become angry and shout at her parents for no apparent reason) and contemplated cutting her hand to release her frustration. To cope with her stress, she had to attend art therapy and counselling at a community wellness clinic, was prescribed medication for insomnia, and resorted to smoking more. She also developed a fear that the offender would turn up at her home or workplace, which made concentration difficult and which prompted her father to pick her up from work daily. As a result of the offender’s repeated visits to the victim’s home, she moved to Malaysia to stay with some family members for a month to relax; while her parents were stressed and her younger sister moved out.

> (b)      **_Second_**, the offender there would have enjoyed the full mitigating value of a guilty plea. He was also assessed to have borderline intelligence, which might have made him less able to react more pro-socially. The latter point is important, because I think it influenced the court to impose a sentence driven more by the need for rehabilitation than for deterrence. In this regard, I note that the court convened a post-hearing conference to assess the offender’s underlying cause for repeat offending behaviour, and to formulate a treatment plan and consider referrals to resource agencies to optimise rehabilitation and reduce the risk of re-offending. In contrast, I do not see rehabilitation as a dominant sentencing consideration here.

118    These help to explain what would otherwise seem to be a lenient sentence in comparison to _Ng Hanwei_ (see above at \[46(b)\]). In sum, these matters would suggest that that the sentence here should, in comparison, be in the region of 5–6 months’ imprisonment.

#### Other precedents involving reprisals by the offender

##### (1)    _Muhammad Nurizam_

119    In **_Muhammad Nurizam_**, the offender, a former patient at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”), pleaded guilty to 2 charges for unlawfully stalking an IMH nurse while under a remission order made by the Commissioner of Prisons. Previously, the nurse had activated a panic alarm upon witnessing the offender punching another IMH patient; this had caused the offender to be restrained and sedated. The offender recognised her while they were on the same bus and, on the spur of the moment, followed her to her residence. The first charge involved stalking from 9.45pm on 16 July 2016 to 11.18am the next day, and comprised:

> (a)     placing a handwritten note at the main door of the victim’s residence;

> (b)     knocking on the door and pressing the doorbell of her residence multiple times;

> (c)     turning off the electricity supply to her residence; and

> (d)     scribbling, at the wall of the lift lobby for her residence, the words “ASSISTANT NURSE, IMH, 33A \[a misspelling of the victim’s name\]. \[the victim’s unit number\]. JUST DOING MY JOB RIGHT? I HATE YOU”.

120    The second charge involved stalking from 10.50pm on 18 July 2016 to 10.37am the next day, and comprised:

> (a)     loitering around the void deck while looking up at her unit once in a while around 11.40pm;

> (b)     thrice turning off the electricity supply to, and loitering outside, the victim’s unit;

> (c)     turning off the water supply to her unit in the morning; and

> (d)     knocking on her door 2–3 times at midnight.

121    The offender was sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment on the first charge and 5 months’ imprisonment on the second charge. The uplift for the second charge was on the basis of the fact that the stalking involved more acts, and was committed after he had been arrested in connection with the first charge and released on bail. On the whole, I consider that Mr Ng’s culpability to be comparable to that of the offender there.

> (a)      **_First_**, while the stalking here and in _Muhammad Nurizam_ were egregious in different ways, the stalking here is more serious on the whole. I can accept that the stalking there was far more intrusive as it affected the victim within her residence (_ie_, when her water and electricity supply were turned off). The harassing notes addressed to the victim there contained some abusive, offensive words and threats of physical violence. However, the communications in the present case were far more profane and depraved and, as I explained above, caused its share of fear of physical safety. Most notably, the stalking here was far worse in terms of duration and frequency.

> (b)      **_Second_**, while V in this case was vulnerable by virtue of age, it was significant that the victim there was targeted out of revenge and because she was performing her duty (and, as such, belonged to a class of persons who deserves special protection). In my judgment, these matters would largely offset each other.

> (c)      **_Third_**, in _Muhammad Nurizam_, the _mens rea_ was graver in that it involved an intent to cause harassment. Apart from the fact, the offender there had committed the second offence while on bail, he had also committed both offences 5 days and 7 days after being released on conditional remission, respectively (which rendered him liable to an enhanced sentence of imprisonment for up to 15 days and 13 days for the 2 charges, being the respective remaining durations of the remission order). These matters are not lightly disregarded, and I think they generally meet the increased seriousness of the stalking in this case.

122    These matters suggest that the sentence in the present case should, in comparison, be in the region of 4.5 months imprisonment. It might be that the sentence in _Muhammad Nurizam_ was slightly lenient on the facts and, to the extent it does not sit as comfortably with the precedents I discussed above, I will place greater weight on the above precedents as they are factually more similar.

##### (2)    _Lee Shing Chan_

123     **_Lee Shing Chan_** involved 2 of 3 unlicensed fruit hawkers who were each convicted of 1 charge of unlawful stalking with common intention. The victims were 2 enforcement officers from the National Environment Agency (“NEA”) who had issued one of them a summons and seized their fruit and makeshift table. For about 3 hours, they had stalked the victims, who were in a NEA van, by following them in their lorry to various locations.

124    The 2 offenders had claimed trial and were each sentenced to 4 months’ imprisonment (the third, who had pleaded guilty, had been separately sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment). In my view, this case in comparison warrants a sentence in the region of 5.5–6 months’ imprisonment.

> (a)      **_First_**, not unlike _Muhammad Nurizam_, the stalking here and in _Lee Shing Chan_ took different forms but the present case is considerably more serious. The stalking there was more intrusive in that it involved being physically near the victims. However, the stalking here was far worse in terms of duration and frequency, and involved far more profane and depraved communications. (Abusive words were used at the officers during a confrontation, but this was the subject of a separate charge under s 6 PHA and not treated as a material sentencing consideration under s 7 (_Lee Shing Chan_ at \[48\]).) The harm caused in this case was graver, too. The NEA officers, in comparison, were alarmed but otherwise suffered little interference with their enforcement duties.

> (b)      **_Second_**, while V in this case was vulnerable by virtue of age, but this is offset by the fact that the victims there were targeted out of retaliation and because they were performing their official duties (and, as such belong to a class of persons who deserves special protection). In this regard, the Magistrate noted the need for a sufficiently deterrent sentence (_Lee Shing Chan_ at \[45\]).

> (c)      **_Third_**, in _Lee Shing Chan_, the _mens rea_ was also graver in that it involved an intent to cause harassment. However, I do not think this is anywhere near offsetting the increased seriousness of the stalking.

## Conclusion

125    The circumstances in which this case was decided were not ideal. Among other things, I would have liked the Prosecution’s submissions to be tested more fully by the anvil of argument. Having considered how this case compares with other precedents and the sentence that the points system might have recommended, and with the shortcomings or dangers of both approaches in mind, it seemed that the range of 5–6 months’ imprisonment was justified, all things considered. I considered that the most appropriate sentence in this case would be 5 months and 2 weeks’ imprisonment. I sentenced Mr Ng accordingly.

126    I ordered that the sentence commence from 30 Aug 2019, being the date that the accused was re-arrested and remanded.

127    The Prosecution has filed an appeal against sentence.
