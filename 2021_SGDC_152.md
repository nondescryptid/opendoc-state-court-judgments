\[LawNet Editorial Note: An appeal to this decision has been filed in MA 9869/2020/01.\]

31 July 2021

### District Judge Ng Cheng Thiam:

## Introduction

1       The Accused claimed trial to a charge of having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, nine straws collectively containing not less than 5.44 grams of granular/powdery substances which were analysed and found to contain Diamorphine, a Class A controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”)[^1] (“the Drug Trafficking offence”). This is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the MDA.

2       At the conclusion of the trial, I found the Accused guilty of committing the Drug Trafficking offence. I convicted him accordingly. The Accused had a 2012 conviction for the same offence. Hence, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane, with the maximum punishment capped at 30 years and 15 strokes of the cane.

3       Upon his conviction on the Drug Trafficking offence, the Accused then elected to plead guilty to one count of consumption of Monoacetylmorphine, a Specified Drug listed in The Fourth Schedule to the MDA[^2] (“the Consumption offence”). The Accused was a repeat offender for drug consumption and faced a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane, with the maximum punishment capped at 13 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.

4       The Accused also pleaded guilty to one count of possession of one straw containing 0.11 gram of granular/powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain Diamorphine[^3] (“the Possession offence”). The Accused was a repeat offender for drug possession and he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years’ imprisonment with the maximum punishment capped at 10 years’ imprisonment or a fine up to $20,000 or both.

5       The Accused admitted to the commission of the Consumption and Possession offences through a Statement of Facts tendered by the Prosecution. I found the Accused guilty and convicted him of the two offences.

6       The Accused further admitted to a fourth offence of having in his possession some utensils intended for consumption of a controlled drug.[^4] The Accused gave his consent for the said offence to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.

7       After considering the Prosecution’s position on sentence and the Accused’s mitigation plea, I imposed the following the sentences:

## Appeal by the Accused

8       The Accused filed a Notice of Appeal against conviction and sentence.

9       As the Accused had pleaded guilty to the Consumption and Possession offences, he could appeal only against the extent or legality of the sentences imposed in respect of these offences : s 375 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”). Thus, whilst the Accused’s appeal against conviction pertains to the Drug Trafficking offence to which he had claimed trial, the appeal against sentence is in respect of the three sentences imposed by this Court (see Table A at \[7\]).

10     Arising from the Accused’s appeal against conviction and sentence, I now provide my grounds of decision.

## Outline of the Grounds of Decision

11     In these grounds of decision, I shall first deal with the conviction for the Drug Trafficking offence and then go on to deal with the issues of sentencing for the three offences (see Table A at \[7\]).

## Appeal against Conviction

### Undisputed and/or Unchallenged Facts

12     The Accused was a drug supervisee who had failed to report for his urine test on several occasions. Arising from this, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) went to his residence at Block 459, Yishun Avenue 11, #XXX, Dew Spring @ Yishun, Singapore 760459[^5] (“the Unit”) to look for him. The visit to the Accused’s residence took place on 1 March 2018, at or about 3.15 p.m. The Accused’s brother opened the door to the Unit. The Unit comprised of a hall and a bedroom. The Accused was then sleeping in the bedroom. The Accused’s mother was also present in the Unit.

13     The leader of the CNB team was Senior Station Inspector Pang Hee Lim Joe (“PW3”). PW3 and some of the CNB officers went into the bedroom. PW3 woke the Accused. A search of the bedroom was conducted. From the bed where the Accused had been sleeping, a ziplock bag containing nine straws, fully-filled with a granular/powdery substance, and another straw partially-filled with a granular/powdery substance, were found by the CNB team. Upon being questioned by PW3 on the said recovery, the Accused admitted that the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances belonged to him. It was not disputed that the Accused knew that the 10 straws contained heroin, a common term used to refer to Diamorphine, a Class A controlled drug.

14     When PW3 asked the Accused why he had failed to report for his urine tests, he informed PW3 that he had an “MC” (a colloquial term for a medical certificate issued to a person on medical leave).

15     PW3 handed the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances to Sergeant Muhammad Norjansher Shah bin Misnan (“PW1”) for the purpose of recording a contemporaneous statement from the Accused. After the recording of the Accused’s contemporaneous statement, PW1 handed the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances to PW3.

16     The Accused was then escorted from the Unit to the CNB Office located within Tanglin Police Division Headquarters.

17     At the CNB Office, PW3 handed the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances to Staff Sergeant Ang Xin Wei Giselle (“PW4”). PW4 then lodged an Arrest cum Seizure Report[^6] before returning the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances to PW3. PW3 stored the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances in his cabinet.

18     At the CNB Office, the Accused was processed and his custody was then passed to Staff Sergeant Mohamad Suffian bin Salleh (“PW7”) for the procurement of his urine samples. PW7 escorted the Accused to the toilet for the Accused to provide his urine samples. After the Accused has provided his urine samples, two bottles containing the Accused’s urine samples were sealed and marked by Sergeant Abdul Azman bin Abdul Rahman (“PW8”). The Accused penned his signature on the labels containing his name and particulars and the said labels were used to mark the two bottles containing the Accused’s urine samples.

19     Later that night, Inspector Lee Zhi Heng (“PW6”), who was the Investigating Officer assigned to the case, received a call informing him that the Accused was unwell. PW6 gave instructions to send the Accused to the hospital for a medical examination. PW1, Sergeant Ibrahim bin Jaafar (“PW2”) and Roy Wee (who was not called as a witness) escorted the Accused to Changi General Hospital (“CGH”). The Accused was seen by Dr Zhou Cheng’en Joel (“PW10”) at CGH.

20     PW3 handed the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances to PW1 for him to bring along to CGH when escorting the Accused. After the Accused was admitted into the hospital, PW1 proceeded to CNB HQ where he handed the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances to PW6 who locked them in his personal cabinet.

21     On 2 March 2018, at 1.45 p.m., in the exhibit management room, PW6 handed the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances and other exhibits relating to this case to Staff Sergeant Tong Ke Cheng (“PW11”). After the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances and other exhibits were marked, photographs[^7] of the various exhibits were taken. PW11 then sealed the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances in a tamper-proof bag before locking the items in a cupboard in the exhibit management room.

22     On 5 March 2018, PW11 retrieved the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances from the cupboard in the exhibit management room and submitted them to the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis.

### The Prosecution’s Case

23     It was the Prosecution’s case that of the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances, the nine fully-filled straws of granular/powdery substances were in the Accused’s possession for the purpose of trafficking. To prove its case, the Prosecution sought to admit the Accused’s contemporaneous statement into evidence. The Accused objected to the admission of his contemporaneous statement claiming that he had not given it voluntarily. An Ancillary Hearing was thus held to determine the admissibility of the Accused’s contemporaneous statement.

### The Ancillary Hearing

#### Preliminary Matter – Discharge of Counsel by the Accused

24     There is a preliminary issue that I should address before dealing substantively with the Ancillary Hearing.

25     The Accused was represented by Counsel until the Prosecution sought to admit his contemporaneous statement. Counsel had initially informed the Court that the Defence would not be challenging the admissibility of the statement. Upon being asked by the Court to confirm his instructions with the Accused, Counsel informed the Court that the Accused was in fact challenging the admissibility of his contemporaneous statement on the premise that he had been threatened during the recording of the said statement.

26     The Ancillary Hearing began with PW1 giving his evidence-in-chief. An adjournment was granted for Counsel to take instructions before commencing his cross-examination of PW1. When the trial resumed, Counsel applied to be discharged on the ground that there had been a change of instructions from the Accused vis-à-vis the challenge to the admissibility of his contemporaneous statement. Counsel stated that he was unable to continue acting for the Accused in the light of the conflicting instructions. As the Accused did not object to his Counsel’s application to be discharged, I allowed the application. The Ancillary Hearing and the trial proceeded with the Accused representing himself.

#### Evidence of the Recorder (PW1)

27     PW1 testified that he was the recorder of the Accused’s contemporaneous statement. PW1 posed his questions to the Accused in Malay and the answers from the Accused were also given in Malay. PW1 would translate the questions and answers into English and wrote them on a piece of A4 paper. The recording took place in the Accused’s bedroom. During the statement recording process, the persons that were present in the bedroom were PW1, Sergeant Nurazhar bin Sadikin (“PW2”) and the Accused.

28     PW1 testified that at the end of the recording of the Accused’s contemporaneous statement, he read and explained the statement “_question by question and answer by answer_” to the Accused. This was done in Malay. The Accused appended his signature to every answer that was explained to him by PW1. The Accused also appended his signature at the bottom right of the paper and wrote his NRIC number. The Accused was given an opportunity to change or amend his statement, but he declined to do so. According to PW1, the Accused behaved normally and did not raise any form of complaint.

29     When cross-examined, PW1 denied the Accused’s allegations that the Accused was suffering from drug withdrawal. PW1 also denied the Accused’s allegation that another officer had told the Accused that the CNB would not bring him to the hospital if he did not sign the statement. PW1 retorted that the Accused sought medical attention only after he had been brought to the CNB Office.

30     During PW1’s cross-examination, the Accused also alleged that if he refused to sign the statement, one of the CNB officers had threatened to search his house; bring his brother back to the station; and he would not be sent to the hospital. PW1 denied these allegations. PW1 added that the Accused had not, at any juncture, refused to sign his statement.

#### Evidence of other CNB officers

31     PW2 testified that the Accused was already handcuffed when he went entered the bedroom. PW3 and other CNB officers then left the bedroom. PW1 and PW2 were the only two CNB officers inside the bedroom when PW1 began to record the Accused’s contemporaneous statement. PW2’s testimony was that the Accused was normal, well and able to answer all the questions PW1 had posed to him.

32     During PW2’s cross-examination, the Accused posed the same allegations at \[30\] to PW2, which PW2 denied. Two new allegations were then added by the Accused. The first new allegation was that he had wanted to make correction to his statement, but was not permitted to do so. The second new allegation was that there was a third CNB officer, described as a male Malay officer with short hair and Chinese looking, inside the bedroom. According to the Accused, this officer was the one who had threatened him. PW2 denied the Accused’s new allegations.

33     PW3 also testified at the Ancillary Hearing. His account of the number of people inside the bedroom during the recording of the Accused’s contemporaneous statement was the same as PW1 and PW2. During PW3’s cross-examination, the Accused claimed that there were four CNB officers inside the room. PW3 disagreed.

34     PW4 and Sergeant Ibrahim Bin Jaafar (“PW5”) also testified at the Ancillary Hearing. In summary, their evidence on two material aspects of the case were consistent with the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW3. First, the Accused was in the bedroom with PW1 and PW2 during the recording of the contemporaneous statement. Second, the Accused could walk on his own, listen to instructions and there was nothing in his behaviour that was out of the ordinary.

35     During PW5’s cross-examination, the Accused identified him as the officer who had threatened him (see \[30\] for the nature of the threats). The Accused also alleged that the questions in his contemporaneous statement were posed by PW5 and not PW1, and that PW1’s role was to record the questions and his answers in the contemporaneous statement. The Accused further alleged that he wanted to make corrections to his contemporaneous statement, but PW5 refused to let him do so. PW5 denied all allegations.

36     PW6, the Investigating Officer, was called to testify at the Ancillary Hearing. His evidence revealed that he first came in contact with the Accused in the hospital on 2 March 2018. As such, his testimony has no bearing on the admissibility of the Accused’s contemporaneous statement.

37     PW7 was the CNB officer who escorted the Accused during the urine procurement process. PW8 was the urine test operator. Both PW7 and PW8’s interactions with the Accused were at the CNB Office after the recording of the Accused’s contemporaneous statement. In so far as their evidence is concerned for the purpose of the Ancillary Hearing, both PW7 and PW8 testified that the Accused’s behaviour was normal and he was able to communicate with them and complied with their instructions pertaining to the urine procurement process.

#### Evidence of the Accused

38     The Accused testified that he had consumed heroin the night before his he arrest. After consuming heroin, he fell asleep as he was not feeling well. He slept through the night until he was awakened by the CNB officers the following afternoon. The Accused testified that he was in drug withdrawal when awoken, and thus he requested to be sent to a hospital.

39     The Accused recalled PW3 finding the drugs on his bed and asking him some questions in English. He could not remember what he had told PW3. It could be some “_nonsense stuff_” such as naming or giving PW3 the name of an Indonesian lady. PW3 then left the room. At this point in time, there were three CNB officers with him. One was standing in front of him. The other two were standing behind him.

40     The Accused testified that PW5 interrogated him. He thought that PW5 was referring to his old case. He replied that previously he smoked and sold drugs. He did not realise that one of PW5’s colleague who was standing behind him was writing down the exchange between him and PW5. Thereafter, PW5 produced a pocket-book and directed him to sign the statement. He read the content of the statement in the pocket-book and realised that it referred to him trafficking a controlled drug. He told PW5 that the statement was for trafficking but he had only consumed drugs. PW5 then threatened him by asking him if he wanted to go to the hospital. The Accused also overhead PW5’s colleague saying that if the Accused did not sign the statement, they would either bring his brother back to the station or search his house. The Accused took this as a form of challenge. He decided to sign, and did so. He explained that he signed the statement so that the CNB officers would send him to a hospital once he had complied with their demand.

41     After signing the statement, the Accused was taken out of the Unit. Before leaving the Unit, he asked for permission to hug his mother because he was afraid that he would not be able to see her again.

42     The Accused was taken to the station and went through the urine procurement process. He was offered food. As he was experiencing drug withdrawal, he refused the offer and was given a packet drink. He did not consume the packet drink until later that night when he was sent to the hospital.

43     Under cross-examination, the Accused was adamant that he was shown a pocket-book and told to sign it. The Accused could not offer any explanation as to how his contemporaneous statement turned out to be on a piece of A4 paper.

44     In the course of the Prosecution’s cross-examination of the Accused, the Court sought a clarification from the Accused. In his clarification, the Accused informed the Court that PW5 was the one interrogating and questioning him and that he was “_talking nonsense_” to PW5.

45     In summary, the Accused’s defence in the Ancillary Hearing consisted of the following:

> (i)     PW1 was not the one who had questioned him. PW1 was merely a recorder;

> (ii)     PW5 was the one who had questioned him;

> (iii)     His statement was recorded in a pocket-book;

> (iv)     He was threatened by PW5 and another officer;

> (v)     He was suffering from drug withdrawal; and

> (vi)     He was referring to an old case when answering to PW5’s questions.

#### Court’s Assessment and Decision

46     The Accused’s contemporaneous statement was recorded on a piece of A4 paper. It was produced in Court and marked for identification as Exhibit P1i. The Accused claimed that his statement was recorded in the pocket-book. The Accused did not produce any evidence to prove his assertion. On the contrary, the evidence of PW1 is very clear. Exhibit P1i contained the Accused’s signature to every answer given by the Accused and the Accused had also signed at the bottom right hand side of the page. He had also written his NRIC number. The Court had observed that the Accused had initialled against an error made at Q4/A4 of Exhibit P1i. Based on the evidence adduced at the Ancillary Hearing, I found that the Accused’s contemporaneous statement was recorded in Exhibit P1i and not in a pocket-book. I also found that Exhibit P1i was recorded by PW1. Further, I found that PW5 was not involved in the recording of Exhibit P1i.

47     I disbelieved the Accused’s account of the alleged threats made by PW5. During cross-examination of the Prosecution’s witnesses, the Accused had alleged that the threats emanated from PW5. In contrast, during his evidence-in-chief, the Accused testified that it was PW5 and another officer who had threatened him. This is but one example of the Accused’s defence being riddled with material inconsistencies. The Accused was also equivocal and unsure about whether there were three or four CNB officers inside the bedroom during the recording of the Exhibit P1i.

48     I accepted the testimonies of the Prosecution’s witnesses that the Accused did not behave in a manner that was out of the ordinary during the recording of Exhibit P1i. I therefore rejected the Accused’s testimony that he was suffering from drug withdrawal.

49     The Accused called his brother as a witness for the Ancillary Hearing. Having reviewed his brother’s testimony, I found that the brother’s testimony did not aid in the Accused’s defence.

50     Having evaluated all the relevant evidence, I found that the Prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused’s contemporaneous statement had been recorded by PW1 and had been voluntarily given by the Accused. The Accused’s contemporaneous statement was therefore admitted into evidence, and marked as Exhibit P1.

51     The relevant portions of Exhibit P1 are reproduced:

### The Nine Straws of Granular/Powdery Substances

52     Following the Ancillary Hearing, most of the CNB Officers were recalled for the main trial to narrate the details relating to the arrest of the Accused and their observation and assessment of the Accused’s action and behaviour from the time of his arrest to the time he was sent to CGH.

53     The other purpose for recalling the CNB officers was to establish the chain of custody of the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances, seized from the Accused’s bedroom, from the time of the seizure till they were submitted to the HSA for analysis. PW11 (see \[21\] and \[22\] above) was called by the Prosecution as he was involved in the custody of the said exhibits.

54     To recap, nine straws were fully-filled with a granular/powdery substance (see Exhibit P7 – photographs of the nine straws). These nine straws formed the subject matter of the Drug Trafficking offence against the Accused.

55     In my assessment, I found that the Prosecution had established a complete chain of custody from seizure to analysis.

56     Goh Jia Hui Karen (“PW12”) was the analyst assigned to analyse the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances. PW12 found the nine straws of granular/powdery substances that formed the subject matter of the Drug Trafficking offence to have a total weight of 5.44 grams. On analysis, each straw was found to contained Diamorphine. The results of the analysis of the nine straws of granular/powdery substances were found in nine certificates issued by PW12 and these were collectively admitted into evidence as Exhibit P10. However, the nett weight of the Diamorphine in each straw was not reported. PW12 explained that she did perform the analysis to quantitate the amount of Diamorphine found in each straw. However, each straw had an amount which was below the reportable weight, which was 0.01 gram. As such, the nett weight of the Diamorphine was not stated in the certificates.

### Evidence of Dr Zhou Cheng’en Joel (PW10)

57     PW10 saw the Accused around 10.30 pm (see Exhibit P2) at CGH. On Exhibit P2, it was reflected that the Accused had complained of chills, loose stools and muscle aches. PW10 explained that these were the subjective input given by the patient. At the end of the medical examination, PW10’s impression was that the Accused was experiencing mild opiate withdrawal. The Accused’s blood pressure was found to be low. The Accused was then admitted to the hospital for hydration and observation.

58     During PW10’s cross-examination, he was informed that the Accused had consumed drugs the night before and slept till 3 p.m. the next day. PW10 was then asked whether the Accused would be experiencing drug withdrawal at the time of waking up. PW10 replied that he would not be able to give an accurate statement without having assessed the Accused at that point in time. PW10 went on to testify that while the Accused did exhibit some mild withdrawal symptoms at the time of the medical examination, he still was functioning at a conscious level such that he was able to communicate and follow instructions.

### The Accused’s Previous Convictions

59     The Prosecution adduced a Memorandum of Certified Previous Convictions[^8] (drugs related offences only) to prove that the Accused was a repeat offender for the Drug Trafficking offence.

### Court’s Decision at the End of the Prosecution’s Case

60     I found that the Prosecution had established each essential element of the Drug Trafficking offence and I thus called upon the Accused to enter his defence. The Accused elected to give evidence in his defence. He was the only witness for the Defence.

### The Accused’s Defence

61     The Accused repeated most of the evidence he had given at the Ancillary Hearing (see \[38\]). He admitted that the 10 straws of granular/powdery substances that were found in the bedroom were his and he admitted to being in possession of the said exhibits. The Accused knew that the granular/powdery substances contained Diamorphine.

62     The crux of the Accused’s defence was that he was a consumer of the said drugs, and not a trafficker. During the cross-examination of the CNB officers who had gone to his Unit, the Accused managed to establish that the CNB officers did not find any paraphernalia related to drug trafficking in the Unit.

63     The Accused retracted the admissions he had made in his contemporaneous statement. The Accused basically repeated the same reasons he had given at the Ancillary Hearing for the retraction of his admissions.

### Assessment of the Evidence

#### The Accused was acting and behaving normally

64     Other than the evidence of PW10, no new evidence was adduced regarding the actions and behaviour of the Accused from the time of his arrest until he was admitted into CGH. The CNB officers who had interactions with the Accused maintained their evidence that the Accused was normal, well, able to communicate properly and compliant with instructions. The Accused maintained that he was suffering drug withdrawal from the moment he woke up. He was unwell and “_groggy_”.

65     PW10 only found mild opiate withdrawal that night when he examined the Accused at CGH around 10.30 p.m. This was about seven hours after the Accused’s had been arrested at about 3.15 p.m. It is pertinent to highlight that PW10 testified that the Accused was able to function at a conscious level such that he was able to communicate and follow instructions. PW10’s evidence was therefore consistent with the evidence of the CNB officers’ vis-à-vis the Accused’s behaviour on the day of his arrest.

66     In the absence of new and compelling evidence, I saw no reason to depart from my finding made at the Ancillary Hearing that the Accused did not behave in a manner that was out of the ordinary during the recording of his contemporaneous statement. I also rejected the Accused’s testimony that he was in drug withdrawal when he was awakened by the CNB officers. In my assessment, the Accused was acting and behaving normally at all material times.

67     The Accused testified that before he was taken away from his Unit, he had asked to hug his mother and he was allowed to do so. The Accused explained that he had sought the CNB officer’s permission to hug his mother because he was afraid that he would not be able to see his mother again. In my assessment, the Accused’s testimony further buttressed my finding that the Accused was aware and conscious of his surroundings and the consequences that flowed from his acts.

#### Weight given to the Accused’s contemporaneous statement

68     I agreed with the Prosecution’s argument that full weight should be accorded to the Accused’s statement. My reasons are:

> (a)     First, the questions were posed in a logical and chronological sequence that were easy to understand. They were posed in Malay which the Accused has no difficulty speaking and understanding.

> (b)     Second, the questions posed were open-ended and there were no suggestions that the Accused was being led to answer in a manner that would implicate him. In fact, it was the Accused who subjectively thought that he was being asked about his previous case, which assertion I rejected. This brings me to the next point.

> (c)     Third, Q1 specifically referred to the 10 straws that were found. This starting question was about the current matter and not about the past. Q2 – Q3 logically and contextually flowed from Q1. The answers given by the Accused therefore referred to the state of affairs at the time of his arrest.

> (d)     Fourth, the Accused admitted in A3 that the straws of drugs were for his “_own consumption and also for selling_”. The evidence adduced by the Prosecution showed that one of the straws was partially filled with granular/powdery substance (see Exhibit P9 – showing a straw marked “MT-B”). The inference drawn by this Court was that this straw was used by the Accused when he consumed the drug the night before his arrest. The Accused’s answer at A3 thus reflected the truth of the matter _i.e._ the straws were meant for self-consumption and also for sale to others.

> (e)     Fifth, Q4/A4 would be the logical extension arising from Q3/A3.

> (f)     Sixth, the Accused’s mobile phone number was stated in A5. The Accused did not challenge that it was an incorrect phone number. Neither did the Accused testify that this was part of the “_nonsense stuff_” he claimed to have said.

> (g)     Seventh, in my assessment, the Accused can speak, read and understand English. There were several occasions during the trial when the Accused spoke in English on his own accord, despite having chosen to speak in Malay. His medical examination with PW10 was conducted in English. I found that the contents of his contemporaneous statement were understood by him before he appended his signature against each of the answers he had given.

### Conviction of the Accused

69     In the final analysis, I found that the Prosecution had proven that the Accused was in possession of the nine straws of granular/powdery substances. I also found that the Accused personally knew that the granular/powdery substances contained Diamorphine. Finally, I gave full weight to the Accused’s contemporaneous statement. Accordingly, I found that the nine straws were in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.

70     Concluding, I found that the Prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt the Drug Trafficking offence against the Accused. Accordingly, I found the Accused guilty and convicted him.

## Appeal against Sentence

71     Let me set out the material facts in respect of the Consumption and Possession offences.

### Facts of the case for the Consumption and Possession offences

72     The Accused was arrested on 1 March 2018 at his residence. At the time of his arrest, the following items were seized from his residence:

73     Following the Accused’s arrest, two bottles of his urine samples were procured, duly sealed and marked, and sent to HSA for analysis. The result of the analysis, certified by two different analysts from HSA[^9], revealed that the Accused’s urine samples contained Monoacetylmorphine, a Specified Drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the MDA.

74     The Accused admitted that he had abused “panas”, a street name for Diamorphine, on the night before his arrest. The “panas” would be placed on a piece of aluminium foil and heated from the bottom with a lighter. Using a rolled-up paper, the Accused would inhale the fumes from the heated “panas”. The Accused’s urine samples were found to contain Monoacetylmorphine as a result of his consumption of “panas”. The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or its Regulations to consume the said controlled drug.

75     The Accused is a repeat offender consumer of a controlled drug and he had been convicted on 18 June 2012 for consumption of Morphine, a Specified Drug under the MDA. This is an offence under s 8(b)(ii) of the MDA and punishable under s 33A(1) of the MDA. The Accused was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane (see \[79\]).

76     In view of the Accused’s previous conviction as stated in \[79\], he was liable to enhanced punishment under s 33A(2) of the MDA for the Consumption offence (see \[3\]).

77     The exhibit marked “MT-B” (see \[72\] at no. 11) was also sent to the HSA for analysis. The said exhibit is a straw containing 0.11 gram of granular substance which was analysed and found to contain Diamorphine. The Accused admitted that “MT-B” belonged to him. The Accused knew that “MT-B” contained “panas”. The Accused was not authorised under the MDA or its Regulations to possess the said controlled drug.

78     The Accused is also a repeat offender for the offence of possession of a controlled drug (see \[79\]). In view of the Accused’s previous conviction for the same offence, he was liable for enhanced punishment (see \[4\]).

### The Accused’s Criminal Convictions and Other Antecedents

79     The Accused has numerous criminal convictions for various offences.[^10] In Table B, I set out his certified criminal convictions and sentences for drugs related offences.

### The Prosecution’s Submissions on Sentence

81     The Prosecution had initially argued for the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentences for the offences with the sentence of imprisonment for the Drug Trafficking and Consumption offences to run consecutively. This is summarised in the table below:

> Prosecution’s Initial Sentencing Position

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="11.12%"> <col width="37.2%"> <col width="51.68%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Drug Trafficking offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two years’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Aggregate Sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">17 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

82     My assessment then was that the Prosecution had failed to apply the totality principle in sentencing correctly. I referred the Prosecution to the case of _Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span> (“_Shouffee_”). I gave the Prosecution an adjournment to review its sentencing position.

83     The Prosecution returned to Court with a revised sentencing position which is summarised in the table below:

> Prosecution’s Revised Sentencing Position

<table align="left" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Judg-2-tblr" frame="all" pgwide="1"><colgroup><col width="11.12%"> <col width="37.2%"> <col width="51.68%"> </colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">1</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Drug Trafficking offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">11 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">2</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Consumption offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Concurrent)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="center" class="Table-Para-1">3</p></td><td align="left" class="br" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Possession offence</p></td><td align="left" class="b" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Two years’ imprisonment</p><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">(Consecutive)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" class="r" colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">Aggregate Sentence</p></td><td align="left" class="" rowspan="1" valign="top"><p align="justify" class="Table-Para-1">13 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

  
  

84     The Prosecution’s argument was that an uplift on the mandatory minimum sentence for the Drug Trafficking offence was required as the Accused had committed the said offence whilst serving a drug supervision order.

### The Accused’s Plea in Mitigation

85     The Accused acknowledged his mistakes and sought a “_global minimum sentence_”[^11]. He argued that an extremely long sentence would be crushing on him and also destroy whatever prospect he has for rehabilitation. The Accused also quoted a portion of Minister Shanmugam’s speech in Parliament that “_\[l\]ong period of detention, we all know, can obviously affect the abuser employability after they are released. When they come out their ability to reintegrate back into society their ability to hold down a job, there is a lesser ability.”_[^12]

86     In another written mitigation plea[^13], the Accused admitted to making a lot of mistakes in his life. He explained that the sorrow and pain arising from his wrong-doings weighed heavily in his heart and his family had to endure more heartbreak and hardship as a result of his incarceration for the present offences. He stated that his aged mother is presently residing in a welfare home and one of his brothers is a patient with the Institute of Mental Health. As a result of his incarceration, he could no longer visit his mother nor help this particular brother. The Accused thus appealed to the Court to show exercise mercy, compassion and leniency when sentencing him.

### Court’s Decision on Sentence

#### Indicative Starting Sentence for the Drug Trafficking Offence

87     In respect of the Drug Trafficking offence, the gross weight of the nine straw of granular/powdery substances was a mere 5.44 grams. The analysis of these nine straws revealed the presence of Diamorphine without stating the nett weight of Diamorphine contained therein. In the circumstances, I was unable to set an indicative starting sentence premised on the nett weight of the Diamorphine found in the Accused’s possession, as advocated in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span>. As the nett weight of the Diamorphine was most likely miniscule, I found an indicative sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane, being the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law, to be an appropriate starting point.

88     The Prosecution had argued for an uplift to 11 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane on account of the Accused having committed the offence whilst undergoing drug supervision (see \[80\] – last row). I was not persuaded by this argument. The Accused’s last conviction for a drug trafficking offence was in June 2012 where he was given six years’ imprisonment and five strokes of the cane. Upon his conviction for the Drug Trafficking offence, and being a repeat offender, the law mandates a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment and 10 strokes of the cane. In my assessment, there is already a significant increase in the punishments – four more years of imprisonment and five more strokes of the cane when compared to the sentence imposed on him in 2012.

#### Indicative Starting Sentence for the Consumption and Possession Offences

89     The Accused is a repeat offender for the Consumption and Possession offences. As such, I started with the respective mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by law:

> a.     Consumption offence – Seven years’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.

> b.     Possession offence – Two years’ imprisonment.

#### Adjusting for Aggravating and Mitigating Factors

90     I did not find any aggravating factor in this case to warrant an uplift of the starting indicative sentences for the three offences.

91     The personal and familial hardships faced by the Accused were not in any way exceptional to warrant any discernible discount in sentencing. In any event, I was mindful that the starting indicative sentences were already the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by law. It was thus not legally permissible to reduce the individual sentence for each offence.

92     At the end of this stage of the sentencing process, the three starting indicative sentences (see \[87\] and \[89\]) were finalised without any adjustment made to them.

#### Applying the Totality Principle

93     Finally, I applied the totality principle in sentencing as enunciated in _Shouffee_ and ordered the sentences for the Drug Trafficking and the Possession offences to run consecutively.

94     For the reasons given above, I meted out the individual sentences as set out in the 4th column of the Table A at \[7\] above. I ordered the imprisonment terms for the Drug Trafficking and the Possession offences to run consecutively. The aggregate sentence was therefore 12 years’ imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane.

## Backdating of Sentence

95     The Accused was arrested on 1 March 2018 and was kept under legal custody. The Accused was sent to CGH on the night of 1 March 2018 and was he warded for observation. However, he remained under the custody of CNB. The next day, 2 March 2018, from the hospital, the Accused was formally charged in court through the use of video-conferencing facilities. Bail was offered but the Accused could not post bail. Hence, he had been remanded since 2 March 2018. Exercising the power under s 318(1) CPC read with s 318(5)(a) CPC and s 318(5)(b) CPC, I ordered the Accused’s aggregate sentence to take effect from 1 March 2018, the date of his arrest.
