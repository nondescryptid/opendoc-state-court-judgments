28 January 2020

### District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim:

Azman Bin Awab, male, aged 51 years, the accused person in this case, faced 3 charges under the Misuse of Drugs (MDA) Act, Chapter 185. These consisted of 1 count of possession of Class A controlled drugs, namely 3.53 grams of diamorphine, for the purposes of trafficking, 1 count of possession of 0.08 grams of diamorphine and 1 count of consumption of methamphetamine, a specified drug, a Long Term 2 (LT2) charge as he had previously been convicted of an LT1 charge of consumption.

2       The accused pleaded guilty to these charges and I sentenced him to serve a total of 12 years imprisonment. The accused is now appealing against his sentence.

## The Statement of Facts

3       The material portions of the SOF which the accused admitted without qualification, is as follows:

> _The facts relating to the charge of possessing a controlled drug for the purposes of trafficking (DAC-909571-2019)_

## A.   Persons involved

4       The co-accused persons are:

> a.     Ismil bin Kadar (“**Ismil**”), a 51-year-old male Singaporean. At the material time, he was unemployed and was residing at Blk 185 Boon Lay Avenue #XXX. At the material time, he was the joint-recipient of the controlled drugs with Azman. Ismil is Azman’s friend.

> b.     Rooben Raj Kripanandhan (“**Rooben**”), a 22-year-old male Malaysian. At the material time, he was acting as the courier of the controlled drugs.

## B.   The plan to purchase diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking

5       Investigations revealed that before 24 October 2018, Ismil met a man known as “Dino Cina”. “Dino Cina” informed Ismil that he was able to supply him with controlled drugs. Ismil then informed Azman that he knew someone who was able to supply them with heroin (a street name for diamorphine). Subsequently, Ismil and Azman discussed and they agreed to order two _batu_[^1] of heroin to share between themselves. According to their agreement, Azman’s share was one and a half _batu_ of heroin while Ismil’s share was half a _batu_ of heroin. Ismil subsequently called “Dino Cina” to place an order of two _batu_ of heroin (“**the Drugs**”).

6       Ismil and Azman purchased the Drugs for the purposes of trafficking.

## C.   Collection of the controlled drugs

7       On 24 October 2018 at about 6.00am, Azman went to the void deck of Blk 185 Boon Lay Avenue to meet Ismil. Azman passed to Ismil $3,000 plus in cash. After counting the cash, Ismil and Azman proceed to go to Jurong Junior College, the location that Ismil was told to meet the drug courier. Azman rode to Jurong Junior College on his motorcycle while Ismil sat behind as the pillon rider.

8       At about 6.50am, Ismil and Azman arrived at the gate of Jurong Junior College and waited for the drug courier. After waiting for about 30 to 45 minutes, Ismil called “Dino Cina”, who told Ismil that the drug courier would be arriving soon. “Dino Cina” also told Ismil to go to the nearby SPC petrol kiosk to wait for the drug courier. When they arrived at the SPC petrol kiosk, they saw Rooben riding a motorcycle with a female pillion rider waiting for them. Rooben signalled Azman and Ismil to follow him. Rooben then led Azman and Ismil to the open air carpark of the SCAL Recreation Centre located at 51 Soon Lee Road.

9       When they arrived at the said open air carpark, Rooben indicated to Azman and Ismil to pass the cash first. Ismil alighted from the motorcycle and handed $4,900 in cash to Rooben. Rooben counted the cash first before handing Ismil a red plastic bag which contained a black bundle. Ismil kept the red plastic bag in the backpack that he was wearing and got back on Azman’s motorcycle. Both motorcycles then went their separate ways.

## D.   The arrest and seizure of the Drugs

10     At about 7.25am, at the junction of Soon Lee Drive and Pioneer Road North, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“**CNB**”) arrested Ismil and Azman. Ismil and Azman were then placed in separate CNB vehicles.

11     While Ismil was alone in the CNB vehicle, he used one hand to unzip his backpack and his other hand to push out the black bundle. He managed to push out the black bundle and it fell to the floorboard. He then kicked the black bundle under the front passenger seat and zipped his backpack again. The officers from the CNB subsequently found and seized, _inter alia_, the following items:

12     In the course of the CNB’s investigations, Ismil admitted he had removed the black bundle (marked as “A1A”) from his backpack and kicked it under the front passenger seat of the CNB vehicle. He did so because he felt that he was part of a matter that involved three persons, and it was not fair for him to face the death penalty alone.

13     On 26 October 2018, the exhibits marked “A1A1A” and “A1A2A” (amongst others) were sealed in a tamper proof bag and sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“**HSA**”) for analysis. On 8 February 2019, Lim Jong Lee Wendy, an analyst at the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued two certificates under s 16 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (the “**MDA**”) pertaining to the analysis of “A1A1A” and “A1A2A” stating the following:

14     The exhibits “A1A1A” and “A1A2A” were found to contain a total of not less than 7.15 g of diamorphine. Diamorphine is a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule to the MDA.

15     Azman, on or about the 24 October 2018 at or about 7.25am, in Singapore, together with Ismil, in furtherance of the common intention of both of them, did traffic a controlled drug specified in Class “A” of the First Schedule to the MDA, _to wit_, by having in his possession for the purposes of trafficking two (2) packets of granular / powdery substances which was analysed and found to contain not less than 3.53 grams of diamorphine, without any authorisation under the MDA or the Regulations made thereunder, and he has thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) of the MDA read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA

16     On 6 December 2019 at State Court No. 24, Singapore, Ismil pleaded guilty to having in his possession for the purposes of trafficking two (2) packets of granular / powdery substances which was analysed and found to contain not less than 3.53 grams of diamorphine under s 5(1)(_a_) read with s 5(2) of the MDA read with s 34 of the PC punishable under s 33(1) of the MDA. Ismil was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment, which was backdated to his date of remand on 25 October 2018.

#### Facts relating to the charge of possessing a controlled drug (enhanced punishment) (DAC-909572-2019)

17     After Azman’s arrest, the CNB officers went to his residence at Blk 511 West Coast Drive #XXX to conduct a search. At about 11.20 am, the officers subsequently found and seized, _inter alia_, one straw of powdery substance (later marked as “AZ-STRAW”) in the pocket of a shirt that they found in his residence. On 26 October 2018, the said exhibit was sealed in a tamper proof bag and sent to the HSA for analysis. On 8 February 2019, Lim Jong Lee Wendy, an analyst at the Illicit Drugs Laboratory of the HSA, issued a certificate under s 16 of the MDA pertaining to the analysis of said exhibit stating that it was found to be one straw containing not less than 0.08 g of powdery substance which was analysed and found to contain diamorphine, a Class A controlled drug under the MDA.

18     Azman admitted to the ownership of the said exhibit . He admitted that it was heroin (a street name for diamorphine) and it was from an old stock of drugs that was meant for his consumption. He has thereby committed an offence under s 8(_a_) of the MDA.

19     And further, before the commission of the said offence, Azman was on 15 February 1996 in the then Subordinate Courts convicted for an offence of possession of a controlled drug, to wit, diamorphine, under s 8(_a_) of the MDA and sentenced to 2 months’ imprisonment, which conviction and sentence has not been set aside to date, and he shall now be punished with enhanced punishment under s 33(1) of the MDA.

#### Facts relating to the charge of consumption of a specified drug (lt-2 enhanced punishment) (DAC-909573-2019)

20     Subsequently, the CNB officers brought Azman and the other accused persons back to Police Cantonment Complex (“**PCC**”), Singapore for investigation. On 24 October 2018, at PCC, Azman provided two bottles of his urine samples that were sealed and respectively marked in his presence. On 25 October 2018, the urine samples were submitted to the Analytical Toxicology Laboratory of the HSA for analysis.

21     The HSA analysts who conducted analysis of Azman’s urine samples issued two certificates under s 16 of the MDA stating that methamphetamine was found in his urine samples. Methamphetamine is a specified drug listed under the MDA.

22     Azman had knowingly consumed methamphetamine on or before 24 October 2018. The presence of methamphetamine in his urine were a result of his consumption of methamphetamine. He is not authorised to consume any specified drugs, and has thereby committed an offence under s 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA.

23     And further, before the commission of the said offence, Azman was on 18 December 2002 in the then Subordinate Courts convicted for an offence of consumption of a specified drug, namely morphine, under s 8(_b_)(ii) of the MDA and punished under s 33A(1) of the MDA with 6 years’ imprisonment and 3 strokes of the cane, which conviction and sentence have not been set aside to date, and he shall now be punished with enhanced punishment under s 33A(2) of the MDA.

## The Antecedents

24     The prosecution disclosed that the accused had prior convictions under the MDA which began in 1989. They are as follows:

25     In addition, from 1993 to 2017, he had been sent to the DRC on 2 occasions and subjected to a drug supervision order on 3 occasions, with the last one being on 6 February 2017.

## The Sentence

26     The accused has been convicted of 3 offences under the MDA and each offence carries a mandatory minimum sentence. I shall begin with the LT2 charge as the punishment for this offence is the highest. The prescribed minimum punishment under the MDA for this offence would be 7 years imprisonment with 6 strokes of the cane while the maximum is 13 years imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. In respect of the charge of possession of a Class A controlled drug for the purpose of trafficking, the mandatory minimum punishment would be a sentence of 5 years imprisonment and 5 strokes of the cane and the maximum is 20 years imprisonment with 15 strokes of the cane. With regard to the offence of possession of a Class A controlled drug, the prescribed punishment for a repeat offender like the accused would be a mandatory minimum imprisonment term of 2 years and the maximum is up to 10 years imprisonment or a fine up to $20,000 or both.

27     Considering that there are mandatory minimum sentences for all the 3 offences, and in particular trafficking, and the LT2 offence of consumption of specified drugs, which involves a substantial period of imprisonment plus caning, there can be no doubt that the law takes a serious view of such offences. Drug activities are regarded as a dreaded scourge and the predominant interest is the protection of society from the menace and social evils associated with drug abuse. Deterrence therefore takes centre stage in determining the appropriate sentence for offences under the MDA. With these considerations in mind, I turn to the facts of this case.

28     Firstly, in their address on sentence, the prosecution submitted that the appropriate sentence for the trafficking charge should be 6 years imprisonment as this was the same sentence that was passed on the accused’s co- Accused, Ismil and this would accord with the principle of parity. As for the charge of possession of the class A drugs, they agreed that the mandatory minimum sentence of 2 years imprisonment should suffice. In respect of the L2 offence, as the accused had previously been convicted of an LT charge, there should be an uplift to at least 8 years imprisonment. While the prosecution proposed that the terms of imprisonment for the trafficking charge and the LT2 charges should run consecutively, and this would result in a global sentence of 14 years imprisonment, they conceded too that the individual sentences should be adjusted to the mandatory minimum to ensure that the sentence is not crushing. In mitigation, the accused, citing his family circumstances whereby he is the sole breadwinner and had elderly parents to support, pleaded for leniency

29     I agree with the prosecution’s submission on sentence on the appropriate individual sentences. Firstly, in respect of the trafficking charge I did not see any reason why the accused should be treated differently from Ismil and received a sentence of less than 6 years. This would also be in line with the sentencing tariffs set out in _Vasentha d/o Joseph v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2015\] 5 SLR 122</span>, wherein the court indicated that for trafficking between 3 – 5 grams of diamorphine, the starting point would be between 6-7 years imprisonment and 6-7 strokes of the cane ( At \[47\]). For the accused’s second LT2 offence, the norm for him would be in the region of 8 years imprisonment. However, the resulting sentence of 14 years imprisonment would be rather crushing since the sentences for the trafficking charge and the LT2 charge should run consecutively. I therefore accepted the prosecution’s submission that the mandatory minimum sentences should be imposed for each offence.

30     Since I had imposed the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by law for each of the 3 offences, I will presume that the accused is not dissatisfied with the individual sentence for each offence. The relevant issue would be pertaining to determining which 2 of the imprisonment terms should run consecutively as by virtue of section 307 of the Criminal Procedure Code, at least 2 terms of imprisonment must run consecutively. Relying on _Mohamed Shouffee Bin Adam v PP_ <span class="citation">\[2014\] 2 SLR 998</span>, I was mindful of the fact that the one transaction rule and the totality principle should not be infringed and that the aggregate sentence should exceed the longest term. (At paragraphs 75-77 of _Shouffee_).

31     If the terms of imprisonment for the trafficking charge and the possession charge were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 7 years imprisonment it definitely would not exceed the 7 year term for the LT2 charge. To order the terms of imprisonment for the possession charge and the LT2 charge to run consecutively would also, as rightly pointed out by the prosecution, be inappropriate as they relate to the same legally protected interest and violates the one transaction rule. In my view, to do so, would result in the accused not receiving any punishment for the trafficking charge and for which his co-accused Ismil was sentenced to serve 6 years imprisonment. The 2 charges of trafficking and the LT2 carried in total 11 strokes of the cane which is not applicable to the accused as he is above 50. Nevertheless, there was a discretion for the court to enhance the sentence by imposing further imprisonment in lieu of caning. Exercising some leniency to the accused I decided that there was no necessity to impose imprisonment in lieu of caning to compensate for the retributive effect of caning.

32     In summary, all considered, the accused was sentenced as follows:
